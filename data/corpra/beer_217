The head has great staying power and leaves wonderful lacing. The nose is funk, citrus, white wine and a touch of graininess. The taste is raw grains and lemon up front, followed by white wine, funk and a drying oak. The sourness doesn't overpower things here, but is obviously present. The mouthfeel is very dry, yet with good body. Overall, it's a good sour that stands the test of time. The complexities I'm looking for are all present, but some are in greater aspects than desired. Still something I'll never say no to. 592 characterszimm421, Feb 05, 2017

I'm tasting mostly tart pear and then the brettanomyces kicks in during the fade and comes off bitter and tart.  This is moderately carbonated,but oddly smooth for a wild ale. 383 charactersFranziskaner, Jan 14, 2017

The mouth, smell, feel and taste all were yes yes yes and yes! All other Brett saison/blondes/golden ales made in the states must be compared to this (Allagash, Boulevard, Perennial, Indeed Brewing all are fantastic but still you gotta give credit where credit is due).

Smells of Brett, oak, white grapes, particularly white wine.  Funky like a cellar, with memories of Cantillon Brewery.
Dry and sour with oaky notes, the same Brett and funk that came in on the nose, and the dusty and dank cellar of an oak laden brewery.
Light body, lots of large bubbled champagne like carbonation, dry and tannic finish.
Super brew.  Got at Russian River in September. Drinking Nov 7th, 2016 in Chiang Mai, Thailand. 552 characterspatre_tim, Nov 07, 2016

That funky cheesy aroma that those Belgians get out of their spontaneously fermented beers. That lambic character definitely is present a little bit in Temptation, with some funky met with sweet red bell pepper, then a touch of celery on the finish. The finish is a little off putting to be honest. It's a really well made and complex beer, but it misses the mark a little for me. 431 charactersSheppard, Oct 16, 2016

S - smells like tart lemon, white wine, little bit of white pepper and barnyard in there but mostly tart lemon, chardonnay does come through
T - same as the smell. Has a tart lemony flavor that sticks on the palate. 
M - medium mouthfeel, alcohol covered, aftertaste is tart citrus rind
O - really well done. As a wild ale I think it's a little less complex than I'd like though. But it's different and VERY well done. 504 charactersHopHunter19, Sep 15, 2016

Appearance: Beautifully bright golden orange color with big chalk-white head. Dissipation is reasonably quick. 
Smell: Barnyard funk, lemon zest, champagne yeast, and herbal spice. Crisp floral notes as well. Wonderful. 
Taste: Subdued tart, some bready malt, overripe banana, apricot skin, and champagne. The funk is much more pronounced with some warming. 
Mouthfeel: Clean, effervescent feel with a soft finish. 
Overall: This is one of the better sours I've had in some time. Definitely glad that I found some in Philly! 548 charactersRanz, Aug 18, 2016

Pours clear light golden, like champagne, with two finger fluffy white head that fades quickly leaving some decent lacing.  Lemony white wine aroma with a touch of funk in there.  Very nice tasting sour, like drinking a good champagne, lemony, woodsy but with a little Brett funk around the edges, pairs together well.  Peppery crisp finish.  Not my favorite style, but very well done, glad I got to try it. 423 charactersNolaHopHead, Jul 02, 2016

4.46/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5With an appearance similar to a glowing hefeweizen with a little less cloudiness, this brings the head, retention and lace like I've never seen in a wild ale before.  Looks glorious.  Aroma was American oak, lemon, tart, brett funk that is not barnyard, but a brighter earth tone.
Taste drops substantial white wine flavors, white/green grape, oak, super sour and tart.  Alcohol well hidden, just like most RR brews.  Was one of the first beers to really take on a lot of wine characters that I remember.  More recent batches have been cleaner, less intense, but its always a world class beer. 594 charactersrodbeermunch, Apr 14, 2016

4.14/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Look:
Nice fairly hazy golden color.  Decent amount of foam (2-3 finger head) with a light pour from the 750ml bottle.  Head recedes pretty quickly, but you are left with interesting foam (ring around outside and some lacing). 
Smell:
Instant blast of sour fruit (sour apple, peach, grape).  Slight vinegar scent, but not too sour smelling.  Some malt / yeast present.        
Taste:
Bitter, sour, bitter, then sour again.  I couldn’t make out the flavors that hit right at first as the first punch is a bit overpowering.  Some bitterness may be from hop additions, but it is hard to tell.  It could be, also, from the Lacto or the Brett yeast.  There are definitely some herbal notes that come in along with a savory vegetable taste.  At the beginning, this ale is very dry and bitter, but there are a few sweeter notes that surface and the dryness backs off a bit.  There are definite signs of fruit and wine in this one.  There is only a slight hint of oak/nuttiness.  Alcohol not very noticeable-only 7.25%.  There are also some faint minty notes.       
Feel:
Very dry that feels like it i9s sucking the life from your tongue.  A bit low:  the light side for mouthfeel.  It still is a bit slick feeling, but the sourness almost leaves a burnt feeling on the tongue.          
Overall:
Still not much of a SOURS fan, but I keep trying.  I heard this wasn’t as sour as their Consecration, so I tried it.  It is still a bit too sour for me to enjoy, but I do appreciate the style and this one seems to be on par for others in the same category.  It would be better, I think, if more fruit, sweetness, and oak aged flavors were evident. 1,651 characterssjdevel, Apr 14, 2016

Very pale, extremely clear straw-hued body; huge, fluffy, creamy, white head; very fine, small bubble carbonation gently rising. Lemon and champagne aroma; white grapes. Bright, sour flavor; semi-sweet white wine quality; citrus; lemon. Medium bodied; bright and crisp on the tongue; sharp; mouthwatering tartness; mostly dry finish.
Wow. And wow! again. Delicious, mouth-watering green apple tartness yet light and refreshing throughout. Outstanding balance of delicate sweetness with a powerhouse punch of sourness. I can't say that my sense of taste is so refined as to differentiate between what the yeast, malt grains, and chardonnay barrel aging all contributed, but I can say that the end product is most pleasing. Yeah, buddy... 775 charactersbeergoot, Mar 28, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a gorgeous translucent golden-yellow. If it weren't for the little bit of foamy head, this would look almost exactly like a Chardonnay. Very well-carbonated and more lacing than expected.
The nose features a huge burst of lemon-line with some brett funk and hits of wood. I'm getting some spiciness and white-wine vinous qualities as well. A lot going on.
The taste is even more complex than the nose. Tart smack of lemon immediately on the tongue followed by lots of peppery spiciness. Notes of dry, oaky chardonnay throughout with a very dry finish. Medium mouthfeel and moderately sour.
A fantastic and complex brew. The only other RR sour I've had of late is Consecration and I honestly think I may prefer this one. 728 charactersTomMorris, Feb 18, 2016

Look is clear, strongly saturated yellow.  More foam head than what I anticipated.  Certainly more than Consecration or Supplication.  Smells is that of wine.  Beautiful aromas. Subtle oak and fruit in there as well.  The Chardonnay barrel definitely comes through in the taste.  Not overly tart.  Fizzy/refreshing.  Smoother end than I expected.  A bit of fruit character noticed at the very end.  
Would love to get more of these at some point. 491 characterseifster82, Feb 06, 2016

4.36/5  rDev -1.1%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured gently at 48°F from a 375ml bottle (bottled on 03Aug15) into a tulip. Consumed on 16Jan16. 
LOOK: Pours with a fingers worth of white foam that dies down into a line within 35 seconds. Golden yellow in color with a moderate amount of cloudiness. A high amount of small and medium-sized rising bubbles is present. Lacing is very subtle in quantity and thin.
SMELL: Strong aromas of chardonnay and sour green apple acidity entangle with mild hay, grassy barley, pear, and white grape aromas along with subtle banana, tobacco, oak, and earthy yeast aromas.
TASTE: Very strong sour green apple flavors first strike the palate. Strong hay and mild tobacco and chardonnay flavors follow immediately. Strong earthy yeast and mild barley flavors keep the ball rolling as sour green apple flavors grow slightly stronger.  Mild flavors of pears and white grapes along with hints of bananas finish off the flavor profile as all previous flavors persist, except for barley, which grow stronger. 
FEEL: Somewhere between medium-bodied and light-bodied. Moderately carbonated. Goes down somewhat smooth. Finishes with a strong dryness. Sourness from the beer playfully agitates the tongue. 
NOTE: Another great from Russian River. I would have liked to tasted more chardonnay and less grassiness from the barley. Perhaps a more fresh bottle would accomplish this. Or maybe a more aged bottle. Who knows? Still a fantastic beer! 1,421 charactersMyotus, Jan 16, 2016

Light tartness on the nose, mixture of funk and some light earthiness. Very tart, pepper, Brett funk, minor astringency on the back of the tongue.

Pour - I wish it was poured out into something nice, but it was poured into a solo cup. Light golden haze with a small white head and very small lacing
Smell - you can definitely smell the wine aged and yeast. Comes out strong, but not overpowering 
Taste - minimal chardonnay with a sour aftertaste. very well balanced 
Overall - Amazing find. Makes me happy I have friends who know I enjoy beer 474 charactersChrisP802, Oct 16, 2015

T: White grapes, chardonnay up front, oak is very noticeable, green apples, cider, lots of complexity. Aftertaste is of green apples, white grapes, pear, oak reemerges and lingers. 
M: Light bodied with good amount of carbonation and a dry finish.
O: Love sour blondes, great balance of sour fruit notes, chardonnay, and oak. This maybe my favorite Russian River sour after Supplication, definitely going to pick up anytime I see this. 733 charactersBrolo75, Oct 10, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A: Golden-yellow body, not much head.
S & T: Smells fairly sour, good funk, a wonderful realistic nuance of peach in there. Not sure how peach got here, but it was confirmed independently by my drinking buddy. Taste is decently sour (I always want more), some funk, and still some peach mixed with other light fruit (apples, rainier cherries). Not much chardonnay or wood notes to be seen, but maybe it's just invisibly well integrated.
F: Not even kidding, this is too drinkable. Even trying to restrain myself, it went by way too quickly for such a rare and rarely-well-made beer.
O: I was expecting RR to pull out all of the stops here, and they did it, but in a different way than I pictured. Instead of going full-force sour/funk, they instead made a restrained, balanced, stylistically and aesthetically solid beer. My own unbalanced over-the-top preference for intense sourness and funk notwithstanding, I do think they could spare some extra funk/earthiness. That being said, this beer is pretty impossible to bash, as long as one appreciates the style. Maybe with a few more years of experience and beer maturity I'll be able to better appreciate Russian RIver's relatively conservative execution. 1,209 characters1000lbgrizzly, Aug 21, 2015

Drank:  08/13/15
A: Golden in color and highly effervescent.  Head is a thin layer of white bubbles and some of the best lacing I've seen for a wild ale.
S: Lots of brett and some chardonnay.
T: The chardonnay barrels are very apparent in the taste and it is not as sour as I was expecting.   White grapes , a hint of honey, and some green apple on the finish.   Only slightly acidic.
F: Light to medium body with a lot of carbonation.   Low to medium dryness.  Slight heat on the back of the throat but it isn't bothersome.   Quite coating
O: This was very good and complex, but I think I'd like to try a fresher bottle.  The brett seems to have taken over.  That said, the brett incorporates with the other flavors quite well. 755 charactersshadetree67, Aug 14, 2015

This is a well-balanced sour ale and much like Sanctification, represents an excellent introduction to the style.  I prefer this one to Sanctification, though, as the influence of the chardonnay barrel seems to represent itself more distinctly and with corresponding higher ABV (7.50% here versus 6.75% in Sanctification).  Sit back, relax and enjoy this one! 428 charactersbowzer4birdie, Aug 10, 2015

The aromatics are absolutely killer: sour, funky, fruity, vinous and a touch of oak to finish things off. All of these flavors come through on the palate with the funk and sour being pretty much perfectly balanced. The vinous chardonnay/oak flavors are a great platform for the brett flavors and help to calm down the acidic streak of this beer. 459 charactersJames_Michaud91, Aug 03, 2015

A very good looking sour ale, like a nice geuze. Scents of softly sweet Belgian malt, wild yeast funk with barnyard, horse blanket and lemon qualities and underlying notes of oak and chardonnay and light fruity aromas of citrus, white grape, apple and light pear. Overall impression of aroma is of a fine sour that showcases a wide array of aromas, both from yeast and the barrel-aging, resulting in a complex whole. Flavor begins sour and funky with notes of straw, grapefruit and lemon zest alongside light undercurrents of white grape and faint notes of honey, oak and dry white wine. Middle increases intensity of sourness continuing notes of grapefruit and lemon zest with light notes of white grape and faint hints of apple mingled with sour funk. Finish is dry and sour with notes of yeast funk, oak tannins, lemon zest and grapefruit upfront, with undertones of white wine and very light undercurrents of white grape and apple. Aftertaste is dry with oak and medicinal and herbal bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a very nice sour. It begins incredibly sour, but slowly reveals a great deal of underlying flavors resulting in a taste as complex as the aroma. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with high, effervescent carbonation and a puckering, drying feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very nice, true to form sour. Overall this is a fantastic barrel-aged sour ale. It has a wonderful complexity in aroma and flavor that adds a wonderful depth and is aided by its excellent mouthfeel. A wonderful gem. 1,619 charactersAuraan, Jun 07, 2015

Appearance: Crisp, bubbly, like a Prosecco at a white-girl bachelorette party. 
Smell: apple cider, tartness, brightness, blue cheese, funk, cheap wine. 
Taste: Very light, champagne, yeastiness, fermentation, sour pucker’s, apple juice. Refreshing, poundable. Wine cooler feel.
Mouth: Light body, good carbonation and bubbles, medium flavor. Could be heftier- dry, peppery finish. 
Overall: Damn fine, but inferior to Consecration/Supplication. Super drinkable, though. Great for spring/summer weather. 615 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Apr 28, 2015

Aroma is tart and you get the barrel character along with some yeasty funk. Taste is sour, fruity, acidic and dry. Grape flavor is quite intense. Body is dry but somehow smooth and well carbonated.

An unforgettable drinking experience. Champagne-like mouthfeel, with flavours of lemon curd, brioche, yogurt and green apple butter. Refreshing acidity that lingers for minutes. Complex, but so damn elegant. Perfect. If only I could bring a case of this back to Canada... 375 charactersRStansel, Mar 02, 2015

This one pours a hazy golden yellow, with a one inch head, very fizzy, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells like white wine, strong sourness, hay, lemon and green apple.
This is an absolutely delicious sour. There is a nice, big white wine character here, lemony and grainy, with a puckering tartness, and a little bit of oak from the barrels themselves. The beer feels alive in your mouth.
This is light bodied, with a very active and prickly amount of carbonation, and a crisp, tart, juicy mouthfeel.
This is absolutely excellent. 571 charactersGreesyFizeek, Dec 22, 2014

Still has a pretty obvious punch of Brett, which can get a bit phenolicky, but otherwise this grabs some of those chardonnay note, some citrus/tropical fruit from the yeast, and marries them together into something pleasing indeed. 344 charactersbreadwinner, Dec 16, 2014

4.4/5  rDev -0.2%Yields a sunny-yellow color, with a one finger broad, bubbly head.
The aromas reveal a tart sourness among wheat notes. It got an almost sweeter sparkling wine character with a noteable barrel infusion to it, which then turns into a more acidic direction. It picks up on the lactic chardonnay characteristic very well, the resulting tartness comes almost naturally to mind. The nose gets completed by hints of white lemon peel, adding a refreshing, fruity aspect.
While the sourness from the aromas was very well integrated into a complex interplay of smells, it shines through big time while tasting the beer. It rises from the sweeter, pungent sparkling wine qualities to unfold on the palate with an almost tongue numbing dryness. The sweeter aspect doesn't vanish from one moment to the other, but evolves during drinking and turns from sweet to sour, while the lively, soft carbonation turns visible. Funkiness is very well integrated, adding depth to the chardonnay lactic acid, without being recognizable on its own, otherwise defined by its typical barnyard qualities. Due to the high carbonation, the mouthfeel is almost sprizzy, fizzy - another well inserted sparkling wine aspect.
I am impressed, that this is still easily recognizable as a beer, while it features very thoughtful and effectively integrated sparkling wine constituents. Malts and hops play an important role, as they prevent the beer from becoming too sweet and fizzy. The subtle musty and earthy additions do the same, convincing me this is still beer. Finishes quite refreshing with a faint lemon fruitiness and an almost bitter, punching, dry sourness. This is incredibly complex and very convincing. 1,684 charactersaleigator, Dec 12, 2014

A: God's urine.  Gorgeous golden body.  Not cloudy at all.  3 finger white head that sticks around for days. 
S: Just keeps getting better and better as it warms up.  Tart lemon, good amount of brett funk.  Sour white grapes.  Smells better than any chardonnay i've had.
T: Complex.  My taste buds are on one hell of a ride right now.  I've had pretty much all of the RR sours that get bottled and this one might be the best yet.  Wow.
M: Soft, perfect amount of carbonation.  No heat from the alcohol.  Can't find any flaw here.
O: Exceeded my expectations.  One of the best beers I've ever had, and I'm glad I have another bottle waiting for me. 699 charactershoppytobehere, Nov 17, 2014

Huge big waves of sour fruit flavors... Not being a fan of sours, it's shocking how much I enjoy this. Smooth and balanced flavors of grape, lemon, apples, butter, oak, apricot, sour cherry, vanilla, butter and just a touch of peach and grapefruit... Is tart and dry, could almost pass as a champagne. It's exceptionally complex and equally balanced... About as refreshing and delicious as a beer can be~ 594 charactersClePaul, Nov 08, 2014

Smell has aromas of oak and dry fruity white wine upfront. Aromas of grape must and oak blend nicely with a nice tart lemon aroma at the end.
Beautiful sour lemon flavor is the first to hit the palate and is balanced nicely with a dry Chardonnay and oak finish with a slight straw malt backbone.
Mouthfeel has awesome complexity with dry crisp and sticky characteristics. Lots of bubbly carbonation makes it super drinkable 493 charactersFcolle2, Oct 11, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally getting to review this one. Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a goblet. Bottled on 06-18-14.
Pours a translucent, golden color with a half inch, pure white head that dissipates rapidly. Exquisite lacing all around the glass as I imbibe. One sexy looking beer.
Smells of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and brettanomyces. Hints of oak, white wine, and fresh citrus. Some serious nose on this brew! Smells of heavenly sourness.
Initial sip gives me wine in oak barrels. Eventually after a second and third I taste the Brett, lacto, and pedio and the oak and white wine mellows out. Great sour tartness but not overwhelming.  
Mouthfeel is pleasant. Very prickly on the tongue with a pleasant tartness that lingers on the palate for some time. Quite drinkable for a 7.50% abv. A very unique brew that would definitely benefit from aging.
Overall a well rounded, intricately brewed, masterpiece! This barrel aged sour is one of my favorites. If you have never has this before I would purchase two bottles if you can and drink one right away, then age the other for at least a year to see how it changes over time.

Ap:  Pours a thin cap of white head atop a hazy, light golden body.  Some yeast chunks float around towards the bottom.  Nice creamy lacing for a sour.
S:  Juicy white grapes and tart pears up front leading into bright acidity, tangy lacto and dry oak barrel.  Some musty barn notes peak out towards the end.  
T:  Big wave of acidic fruit that brings to mind gooseberries, straight lemon juice and white grapes.  Nice yogurt tang in the middle with a drying oak barrel and a bit of brett.  Juicy and tart. 
Mf: Thin feel made larger by the prickly acidity.  Smooth and wet.  Great drinkability.
O:  So much juicy fruit tartness with a drying finish that makes you want more and more.  Nice backing flavors of tart oak, tangy yogurt and musty barn floor.  So good.  How can I get more Belgian style ales like this? 899 charactersCowsandBeer, Sep 26, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7.7%Poured from bottle into my Hill Farmstead stemware. Bottled on 6/18/14.
Fills the glass with a bright and slightly hazy orange body and a beautiful creamy and dense white head. Opens right up on the nose with a heavy dose of lemony-citrus sour notes and fruity banana Chardonnay notes. As it warms, the oaky wood starts to come through as well. Just a hint of musty and funky yeast notes in the background. 
First sip reveals a great sour and tart citrusy goodness. A nice farmhouse yeast character comes through with great earthy funk. Not quite as fruity as the aroma was, but the Chardonnay doesn't go unnoticed. Overall, a great blend of wood, yeast, and sourness, thats served well by the excellent blonde ale at its base. 730 charactersKinsman, Sep 07, 2014

Clear pale golden color, thin white foam, bubbles swim up like a fine champagne

375mL bottle (bottle 7/27/2012) into a tulip. Pours a slightly hazy pale golden color w/ a short-lived 1-finger white head, bright lively carbonation.
Aroma is tart and funky; grassy, earthy, acidic. 
Taste follows nose. Sour, clean. The chardonnay and oak come through along with golden raisins and white grapes.
Mouthfeel is clean and sharp; it's light, playful, and utterly refreshing. Finishes clean and bone-dry. 
Overall a crisp, bright, drinkable, well-made beer. 634 charactersdraheim, Sep 07, 2014

Temptation - Russian River 
BA wild ale 
7.5% ABV 
APPEARANCE: Pours a kings crown gold with a brilliant star-bright glow coming from the bottom of the glass. Small thin white soapy head that dissipates into a halo that stays the entire time I'm drinking. 
AROMA: Beautiful bouquet on this beer, huge sour tartness initially with loads of lemon and hay blended together. Perfectly ripe green apples, grapes, white wine notes and oakiness. 
TASTE: My taste buds are playing celestial trumpets. A perfect marriage of sweet and sour. Like drinking a Chardonnay with lemon zest on top. Sour grapes and slightly sweet grassy notes. Nice faint flavors of barrel and malt. 
MOUTHFEEL: Light plus body with a medium dancing carbonation. Funky, dry long lasting finish. 
OVERALL: This beer was the perfect outside right before sunset 75 degree choice. Super refreshing and easy drinking. I am just starting to explore into the world of sours, out of all the RR sours I've had this is by far my favorite.

Pours a hazy golden orange with a white sudsy head that dissipates quickly into a frothy retention cap that sticks around throughout and leaves some lacing. Its a lovely beer to look at. Lemon on the nose, with hints of oak and white wine grapes. Very light and crisp aroma. Tart and puckering on the front of the palate, with notes of lemon, oak, and sweet grape. Finishes extremely dry with little to no lingering aftertaste. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall, a supremely well crafted barrel aged wild ale. Well balanced, complex, and extremely drinkable! 594 charactersJohnG190, Jul 30, 2014

M: Medium bodied with abundant carbonation, not unlike a spritzer or wine cooler - works very nicely with the taste of this beer.

Smell - The grapes from the aging really come through in the aroma. Sour notes reveal the intentions of the grapes.
Taste - My initial impression was sour grapes, largely from the aging process. Further, the taste evolves to notes of grape skin and some citrus notes. The taste finishes with dry sour notes.
Mouthfeel - I found myself wishing the carbonation was a little more muted which would allow for the taste to be extended.
Overall - It would be close between Temptation and Supplication to determine my favorite Russian River. 633 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jul 13, 2014

Rich and rounded aroma. Quite tart with some goaty barnyard notes and then fruitiness. Quite a bit of oak. Vanilla and buttery oak. Interesting and very nice.
The palate deliversa moderate tartness backed up with the woodiness of the aroma. Fruit follows to cleanse and add complexity. Not as earthy as the aroma. Still very good.
Medium body with moderate carbonation and some tannin. Good.
A really excellent beer. Not as great as I remember it being last time I had it but still very enjoyable. 567 charactersdgilks, Jul 10, 2014

A- Light gold in color. Off white head stays thin, but sticks around for the entirety of the drink.
S- Tang in the nose. Citrus and some apple. Not overly sweet.
T- Tangy again, like the nose. Apples and citrus is what I pick up. Just a faint toasted malt. 
M- Light, tangy, and a dry finish. Much less sweet than the other sours I've had from RR. (Consecration, Supplication)
O- Spectacular. I really love the tang and dryness this one brings, and the flavor profile is great. 527 charactersBWED, Jul 02, 2014

A: A very clear and glowing golden appearance. 
S: Whoa, I got tons of lemons, very nice funk aroma but the lemons dominate through out with undertones of grass and oak. 
T: Follows the nose. Big tartness up front with the lemon/citrus flavor dominating the palate then falls into that nice funk. Again underneath you get that grassy, oaky flavor to it. 
M: Light body, high carbonation and a very dry finish.
O: Very enjoyable, not going to blow your socks off but I would definitely buy this if I could. 553 charactersMrMoose916, Jun 25, 2014

A: light-golden liquid with a bright, jewel-like glow... brilliant clarity... initial feathery foam, falls out leaving a scattered collar
S: mild black pepper and grassy white wine... soft, elegant sourish tartness
T: subtle white grape, perhaps a dry peach... nice, delicate balance of lactic tartness, hardly puckering... quite dry, light-moderate balance of dry oak grain
M: very light, dry... crisp but not sharp... mild tannic finish (wood grain)

A: 4.5 Slightly hazy golden yellow with a small off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. 
S: 4.5 Lots of lemon and funk at first with some light pine and a touch of vanilla. Funk opens up a bit more with bringing some dry, aged cheese aromas; it sounds weird but it's really pleasant. 
T: 4.25 Fairly tart with a little sweetness. Lost of lemon and orange, a good amount of funk, and some grassy earthiness. Not quite as much going on as the nose, but still very good. Vanilla and oak come through a bit later on. More citrus on the aftertaste along with some herbs, green apple, and more oak.
M: 4.5 Nice carbonation with a fairly light body. Has a very nice, dry finish. 
O: 4.5 Great sour blond. Reminds me a lot of some classic Belgian guezes, with a bit less tartness and more citrus. 808 charactersTele, Jun 06, 2014

A - Light orange with ~2-2.5" worth of white porous head. 
S - Grapes, wine, vanilla, sour fruit.
T - Grapes, tartness / pink grapefruit, oak, vanilla. Tartness lingers.
M - Like Champagne, bubbles from first sip to swallow. 
O - Very interesting. You can certainly taste the wine like qualities, but that Brett makes for some interesting sweet fruit and sour acidic notes. Very drinkable and seems to have aged nicely. Prost! 450 charactersBowers-Brew, May 11, 2014

S - Peach, musty sour green grapes. Aromas of peach blossoms.
T - Very sour. Lemons, unripe cox apples. Almost mouth-puckering. Not a huge amount of oakiness with a mildly astringent finish. The tartness overpowered the fruit and the funk from the brett.
M - Crisply carbonated which enhances its refreshingness. Body was medium and much less sparkling than champagne, for example.
O - Obviously expectations were fairly high with this one, and as is wont to happen from time to time, they were not met. I found the acidity ate away at the other characteristics which the beer might have offered. Not mind-blowing, and for this drinker, probably not worth the effort required to get hold of the bottled form. Will revisit in the future to see if my palate has changed. 823 charactersabeeronthebeach, Apr 21, 2014

It's very lemony and citrusy with a general theme of apricot. A light crackery malt in the middle along with a nice touch of cherries. After the citrus, the barrel gives some oak notes and drying. 
A very tart, yet well balanced sour. One of my favorites from Russian River. 339 charactersdar482, Feb 12, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - A bright, golden orange. Nicely carbonated, very clean. Slight lacing along the glass, minimal head that stays.
S - Almost like Champagne, with a nice citrus and tropical aroma. This aroma is quite bright. Not much of a malt smell, but not necessary.
T - That oaky, barrel flavor hits first; it's a nice sweetness of slight vanilla. Then the citrus-orange-tropical flavor strikes the middle of your tongue and joins the oak. I get a slight sour grape/mild green apple there, too, as you go to the finish. The finale is nice and dry. You definitely get a tiny bit of bitterness from the hops, too, which is a surprise.
M - Medium, fizzy mouthfeel. Nothing too strong, though. Light bubbles, again, like champagne. Smooth and bubbly at once.
O - Probably the best-balanced, wild/sour ale I've ever had. It has a wine-ness that's pleasant at first, then a great, light-citrusy beer finishes you off with a fizz. It's very fresh tartness is balanced very well, and the whole beer in the glass is a top-notch experience from pouring to tasting. 1,047 charactersthecommonman, Jan 31, 2014

A-Bright Golden body with a head that quickly fell back into the beer and went missing. No lacing/retention. Clarity would be great for this beer but there is sediment floating throughout my glass. That was probably my fault due to my anticipation of wanting to try this for so long that I poured it a little to rough.
S-Vanilla, oak and a huge punch of freshly squeezed grapefruit mix together for a aroma that is different but intriguing and beautiful at the same time. The grapefruit is the from the sourness and also get some nice funky/musty notes with subtle peach aromas.
T-This is a sour beer and I love it. Mouth puckering goodness once you take it all in. Starts off as a simple belgian-esque beer and than you hit the middle and back palate and it shows you that it is a sour. Sourness turns into funky barnyard back into sourness with hints of that vanilla/oak from the barrels.
M-Medium-thin body, high carbonation and a super dry finish.
O-Enjoyable beer. Have had this cellaring for a couple months now and decided to take it out. Wish I had another one or two of these in my "cellar" so I could age them and see how they progress and change overtime. Lovely sour beer and cannot wait to have this one again. High price where I got it($20 for the 375mL) but happy with the purchase! 1,347 charactersmikem0487, Jan 29, 2014

stemmed goblet.
A- Yellow-gold murky brew. A 1/2" head fades away to nothing quickly. Heavy carbonation as evidenced by the strong string of tiny bubbles arising from the bottom of the glass.
S- Sourness, tartness, mild acidic vinegar appears immediately in the nose, followed by a wine
aroma from the oak wine barrel aging. Tart cherry, peach, red grape, and a hint of citrus are all there, along with a bit of malt from the base beer.
T- The wine barrel taste is right there at first with the sharp, sour cherry and fruit tastes holding up their end nicely. A hint of malt base keeps the sourness in check, and makes for a great all around blend.
M- Tart and sour, but not overly so. Strong carbonation allows all facets of the beer to dance around on the tongue. Nothing overbearing here.
O- A well balanced wild ale. Like I'm diving into a glass of wine for a split second, then quickly into sour, tart and fruity goodness. I prefer a couple of the other RR sours, but would never turn this one away. 1,105 charactersGambelli, Jan 12, 2014

Poured into a Riedel Vinum Pinot Noir glass, it showed a sudsy, soapy head and a brilliant lemon/gold color. Smelled incredibly fresh and tangy, with citrus and hints of vanilla. The flavor was really good, but was a bit one-dimensional (I'm thinking of it compared to a Pliny the Elder that was consumed last night). Nice acidity, hoppiness, and vibrancy on the palate, with a clean aftertaste. Good stuff and I need to find some more :-) 499 charactersmarkchristenson, Jan 06, 2014

S - Citrus citrus citrus. Lots of lemon aroma. A little funk, a little wood
T - When its cool-cold, its a lemon bomb. Not overly sour, but lots of lemon/citrus flavor, but not in a hoppy-citrus way. Its more of a tamed down lemon kind of citrus. As it warms up it improves, as with most sours. As it approaches 60* more wood and funk emerge. 
M - medium-light body; what a bright sour should be. 
O - Another very good -ation for RR. I have tried Supplication and Concecration also. In order, I prefer Supp, then Conc, then Temp, so its my least favorite of the -ation's that I've had, but its still a great beer. Im really splitting hairs. It mostly depends on what flavor profile you are in the mood for, as those 3 are all fairly different, so its not an entirely fair comparison. 825 charactersMCImes, Jan 02, 2014

A: Light golden, pours with 2 fingers of white head that reduces slowly and leave a little bit of lacing. 
S: Citrus funky goodness. The aroma is well balanced, giving enough fruit notes to balance out the funk.
T: Very similar to aroma, but the sour punches through the citrus. The after taste is very mellow, making me crave even more.
M: Carbed very well, very similar to champagne, but not quite as much. 
O: The balance and complexity of this beer is very well crafted. There aren't many sour beers (which I've had) that are all around this easy to drink. I'm slowly turning into a sour fan, and it's beer just like this one that is the reason why. With all the hype around super hops and bourbon barrel stouts, it's nice to have a world class beer like this that stands out in it own way.

4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375 ml bottle into tulip glass, batch 05X1E. Pours lightly cloudy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tart green apple, grape, pear, lemon zest, straw, hay, grass, oak, clove, pepper, white wine, vinegar, leather, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with big complexity and great balance of yeast ester and wine barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of tart green apple, grape, pear, lemon zest, hay, straw, grass, honey, bread, oak, clove, pepper, white wine, vinegar, leather, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, grape, pear, lemon zest, hay, straw, grass, honey, bread, white wine, oak, clove, pepper, leather, vinegar, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt, wine barrel, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding wild ale as expected. Tons of great complexity and well balanced flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering. 1,452 characterssuperspak, Nov 21, 2013

Nectar, a touch of horse blanket, apricot, marigold, sponge cake, and white grape skin - deep nose.
Honey on country loaf up front, some yellow apple, vinegar tang, kumquat tartness, a twist of lemon zest, some oaky vanilla, a hint of chalk, perhaps some Chardonnay gooseberry and a hint of spice.
Waxy starfruit finish and clean acidic linger.
Crisp, light to medium, some chew, lively. 
OK, yeah, this is pretty damn good. The secret to this, I think, is a very good golden ale as a base. Oak, Brett and beer all in finely calibrated balance, opening it up to remarkable depth. No burn, and amazing how funky it isn't. 
I'd probably need to taste other, less accomplished sours to appreciate how well this is done, but I'd drink this again in a heartbeat. 856 charactersStJamesGate, Nov 17, 2013

A: Cork nearly blinds me as it flies out immediately when I undo the cage. Pours a clear light amber. Tall frothy white head. Head fizzes out fairly quickly. Light and very fluffy lacing left behind. A surprising amount for a sour.
S: Oak and chardonnay for sure. Quite tart from the aroma. Has an acidic citrus component to it too. Maybe some sour apples?
T: Quite tart and sour. Lots of tart wine up front; distinctive chardonnay. Sour apples and citrus (mostly lemons I would say). Just a hint of a bready malt, it's almost graham cracker-like. Drying oak in the finish with more chardonnay and sour fruits. Between sips there is a decently strong leathery aspect as well. 
M: Nice medium body. Dry. Quite dry.
O: Not bad. I am not a huge wine fan, especially chardonnay so I am biased unfortunately. Definitely adds some nice complexity at least. One of the better sours I've ever had. 912 charactersDope, Nov 12, 2013

Hazed bright golden blonde, ring of white head and a bit of lace. Smell is earthy with oak oak and a great deal of funk/acidity, lemony, citrus fruits as well as white wine, even more funky as it warmed. Tatse is initially a sharp acidity and quite sour, earthy and a bit of oak, sour fruit, lemon, white wine and incredibly dry finish, puckering aftertaste. Dry medium carbonation, medium bodied. Really good stuff, great mix of sour, white ine, oak and fruit here, would love to aquire a couple bottles of this. 537 characterspeensteen, Oct 25, 2013

S: Lovely sour/tart fruit smell to it, very dominant, can also pick up some brett funk, faint bready malts, and a hint of honey as well, smells fantastic!
T: Sour/tart fruit dominate the flavor! Notice some bready malts and brett, the brett is not overpowering at all and is very light, slight sweetness at the end, the sourness level is just right, and the flavors mix together extremely well
M: Medium bodied, slightly syrupy, sticky, but finishes extremely well, after you take the drink everything is gone instantly, nothing lingers but the flavor of the fruit and that is minimal at best
O: Absolutely fantastic beer! One of the best feels to a beer I have ever tried, the sour/tart fruit flavor is outstanding, yet again RR, one of the best beers I have had, definitely get this beer! 905 charactersbpasquini, Oct 23, 2013

smell is Belgian yeast rich, fruity. green apples? but you certainly know where you're going with the nose on this one....
slightly tart up front, slightly acidic and vinegar-y in the middle, and wine-y grape-y towards the end. not a wine, but not (quite) a beer either(?). a majestic 'fermentation', shall we say? 
some sweetness somewhere in the middle of all this. I completely understand the incredibly high scores for this brew. I love this. I like sours, but this isn't totally 'there'. it's definitely a unique brew which Russian River just seems to be so capable of producing. now there IS a certain residual 'property' which lingers on the sides of the tongue as it builds up with continued draws... i'm not sure how to classify it, but it IS a 'residual' of some sort. not quite 'chemical'. not completely 'organic'. and not always present. this is certainly one of the great brews to have tasted... I completely bow down to Russian River for the successes... very rich, very pronounced properties. a little more difficult to acquire down here in orange county, and definitely one you need to grab if you ever find it on the shelf. IF you're open to a slightly sour brew... rescued the day!! compared to that Alaska mikkeller, this is heaven!!!! 1,402 characterspkalix, Oct 01, 2013
4.91/5  rDev +11.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Thank you Geuzedad for another gem.
Appearance: Deep hazy yellow. Pure white foamy head with good retention. Head dissipated rather quickly.
Smell: Grapes, chardonnay, oak, Belgian yeast.
Taste: Tastes like a mix of oak and chardonnay. Slightly lactic, very easy to drink. Way more mild of a sour than most others.
Mouthfeel. Not a puckering as most sours. Very well carbonated. I barely loosened the cork and it went flying across the room:)
Overall: It's hard to decide whether to give it a 5 or 4.75. It is absolutely amazing, yet kind of one dimensional. I wish I could drink this everyday. Russian River fails to disappoint.

Nearly flawless, with the exception of some personal preference towards appearance and mouthfeel. Even still, it gets incredibly high marks there. It's a wonderfully tart and refreshing beer with the most pleasantly subtle oaky chardonnay background. This is a prime example of how to use Brett in a beer. It's vinous and effervescent, and just awesome. 454 charactersdwagner003, Sep 29, 2013

Poured a hazy deep yellow, hint of orange, white head of a little less than a finger depth, good lacing, and great retention.
Smells of sour grapes, green apples, sour cherries, white wine, and oak. As to be expected, nothing surprising there.
Taste is pretty damn nice. There is a great sweet and sour vibe going on that balances the beer well. The taste is of sour tart grapes, apples, and cherries, but enough fruit flavor remains to put a nice sweetness to it. A touch oaky, very complimentary. A very strong presence of chardonnay in the taste, and it blends so damn well. Impressive.
Mouthfeel is medium to full. Carbonation is medium, spot on. Smooth and sticky but clean, just a really impressive feel to this beer, I love how every sip feels.
Overall I loved this beer, it was almost as good as consecration and supplication, certainly one of my favorite sours of all time. The wine barrel aging really makes this, as it does the other russian river sours. Well done, must try for everyone at some point. 1,106 charactersMCain04, Sep 21, 2013

Pours a beautiful hazy straw colour, with a lovely 2cm white head with great retention. Looks so incredibly refreshing with a lot of great lacing as this one goes down- that's all I have to say about the appearance.
Smell is interesting and very aromatic, but a little one dimensional. I can definitely get the oak and chardonnay scent here, but its not particularly complex. It smells so refreshing though that I can't dock it too many points. I can tell that this is the base for the FfaC though.. a bit of that funkiness in that nose also, but not a ton. Definitely get a little bit of lactic acidity, like FfaC, but its not particularly acidic sour. One thing about this one is that it smells so clean.
Flavour is great, so refreshing, but not too complex. Its a combination of oak and tannins, lactic acidity and some sweetness which is more of that dry chardonnay sweetness combined with a little bit of citrus zest. Not a ton of funk in this one, like a good geuze, but its definitely a very, very palatable flavour. I think this is a great beginner's sour, honestly, even more so than Sanctification or Supplication.
Its a lighter bodied beer but it is so incredibly refreshing. I would definitely use this is a hot day-porch beer, or a palate cleanser. Its so pleasing, I can see this is a beginner sour. I would be able to drink a pitcher of this without any problems, its that great in disguising the 7.5% ABV booziness. Very drinkable, may quite possibly be the most drinkable of the RR sours.
Definitely worth trying; its not über complex but its got that good sour quotient and a bit of complexity to it. Russian River's other sour offerings are more complex and flavourful, but if you are new to sours, this is one I would definitely try first before all the other sours. 1,917 charactersStevedore, Sep 19, 2013

A - Pours a glowing light amber golden hue, initially clear, with a slight haze from the leftover yeasties. 
S - Bright and aromatic with notes of grape, straw. Slight funk with a dominant Belgian brett yeast character. Clean but pungent. Marshmellow, ambrosia, pineapple poetry on the nose!
T - Delightful. Rich, full orange peel and lemongrass upfront that blends into a tart, succulent funkiness. Notes of grape and grape must with a tinge of oak tannin.
M - Fun and light on the palate but with a medium body to sustain through each flavor intricacy. Quite palatable -- I swear I could drink an entire pitcher of this and be in heaven (I promise to do it slowly, don't worry). 
O - A pleasurably fun light ale with the Belgian twist. One of the more memorable sours I've enjoyed. 808 charactersStrongAleSkeptic, Sep 18, 2013

Pours golden with plenty of visible carbonation. Beautiful
Lacing right off the bat. Trails of bubbles.
Farmyard, horse blanket and grainy notes. Some lemon and tart cherries comes to mind. 
Whoa! This packs a punch. Loaded with tart characters and finishes so dry. More lemon and tart cherries with biscuity/bread to back it up. So easy to sip. The bottle doesn't last nearly long enough. 410 charactersstewart124, Sep 15, 2013

4.63/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5This was one of those rare and perfect beers.
Pours a clear, vibrant gold color with a pretty orange hue. Streaming effervescence. Looks like a glass of white wine or champagne except for the fat head of white foam. Delicate, tight bubbles that cling to the glass and fall off slowly to a cap and thick ring. Couldn't be any prettier.
Nose is chardonnay wine. Has a nice crisp wine like scent with a touch of sour lemon. Brett and barnyard. Wet grass. The nose has just a touch of the oak and a dryness from the brett that also seems to be a little sour. The malt is faint on the nose and not much more than a breath of biscuit. As it warms the lemon becomes a little sweeter. 
Taste is divine. It's tart and sour. The mouth waters from the first sip. it tastes of the chardonnay and oak. The bubbles make it sparkle on the tongue. It has a mineral quality and a it's a little edgy too. Bold and daring. The malt is light, fluffy and biscuity bread. The drink is dry and warming. So fruity, so juicy. 
This is one of the best beers you will have. The chardonnay character and the brett go so well together. The oak is understated but adds depth and the malt is superbly light. Crisp, fresh, billowing and ample. This is a beer you can linger over and really appreciate it's indulgence. 1,289 charactersutopiajane, Sep 06, 2013

Russian River
Batch# 003
A big thanks goes out to errantnight for providing me with a few of the Russian River sours, thanks again Derek! Temptation's body is deep golden with a moderate haziness. Large carbonation bubbles explode to the surface from every inch of the glass. The carbonation kept the two finger micro bubbled head alive throughout the entire drink. I'm surprised to find it but chunky, sticky lacing is left behind after each drink. This is a great looking beer!
The nose is loaded with tart orchard fruits. Apricots and peaches are the first thing to jump out along with vinous qualities from the chardonnay barrels. All of these aromas bring tartness to the nose; green apple skins play a big role as well. The malt base is all about pale, semi sweet malts that allow the Brett to do its thing. The depth of this beer is outstanding and the fruitiness meshes perfectly.
The flavor follows closely in the footsteps of the aroma. Tart apricots fall away for the peaches to step forward upfront. The vinous qualities come through mid-palate along with green apple skins that leave behind a solid tartness that lingers after the swallow. The only addition to the aroma is a slight bready maltiness along with candi sugar-like sweetness toward the finish. This is a delicious beer from Russian River.
The body is medium but the lively carbonation makes the body feel airy. The dryness grows as I drink which accentuates the tartness on the swallow. 
This beer is dangerously drinkable and should be bottled in 750s. 375ml is not near enough of this delicious beer for one sitting. I find myself not being able to set the glass down.
Temptation is one of my favorite sours to date. This is a fantastic beer in all aspects that I just can't get enough of. The tartness of this beer comes across ridiculously well. Thanks again for picking these up Derek! 1,893 charactersjoe1510, Aug 19, 2013

At the source. Crystal clear light golden copper yellow, pure white minor head stays a cap 
for the entirety, nice lacing.
Aroma is intoxicatingly seductive, the chardonnay is front and center, defines the experience by any measure. Properly acidic and dry. 
Chardonnay again defines the sensation. Impeccable, the ultimate intro brew for the wine drinker. Flawless as a wild as well. The evolution of the flavor is staggering. More than thin bodied crispy lively mouthfeel with just a proper touch of 9 volt.
cheers

Pours a hazy yellow with a half inch white head. Some fizziness from the bottom to the top, with a huge amount of lasting bubbles. On the nose i get a strong vinegary scent very reminiscent of a geueze. The taste is also very similar to the traditional gueuze style - tart white grapes with a very lasting sour on this one. As my favorite style is a gueuze, im really digging this. Exceptional mouthfeel, like all RR beers ive had thus far, makes this beer extremely easy to drink. Though i find myself savoring it as the flavor is superb. Finishes dry. Very dry in fact.
Overall another excellent beer from Russian River. As close to a gueuze that youre going to get in America. 735 charactersAxnjxn, Aug 05, 2013

Right on the front of the bottle is a large sickle with the name of the beer in big yellow letters along the handle. Above the sickle is an end of a barrel with how long the beer was aged and the types of yeast circling the barrel. To the right of the sickle is the Government warning, proper glassware, the definition of Temptation, a lengthy description of the beer, and a batch number. My bottle was from batch 004X5. According to RR's website, this beer was brewed on 5/25/08 and bottled on 6/5/09. 
I wish I had a RR Snifter or Tulip to pour this beer into. I guess my Great Lakes Snifter will have to do. From behind the cork came a lightly hazy bright golden apricot colored beer that had a tiny touch of amber to it. I really did like the color of this beer. The head of foam was almost as impressive as the color. Up rose a 1/2 an inch pearl white head of foam. This head of foam had slow retention. It took its slow ass time to recede. That's fine because I wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. When all said and done, it left behind a fat white string of rings, an island of foam, and a fair amount of blots and streaks of lace. This beer was eye candy! 
The aroma was lightly sour and tart. It was one of those pleasantly sour aromas. It wasn't a make your heard turn strong sour aroma. Up front in this sour aroma was the green grapes and oak. This must be the French Oak shining through. Quickly following that combo was some barnyard funk and a whiff of spices. When the second aroma combo had their fun, the beer then finishes up with green apples, a touch of lemon, and a subtle pinch of candi sugar. There was a lot going on in the aroma. This beer had a pleasant level of both barnyard funk and oak. Not one of those controlled this aroma. 
Pucker up tastebuds! This beer was sour and tart. Like the aroma, it wasn't overly sour and tart. The sour and tartness just wanted to let you know it's there without punching your tastebuds to death. There was also some barnyard funk in this beer as well. Like everything else in this beer, that was kept down to acceptable levels. They didn't allow that to punch your tastebuds as well. Intermingled with all the sour, tartness, and barnyard funk was the green grapes, green apples, French Oak, orange peel, lemons, and candi sugar. This beer didn't allow the oak to get out of control either. An extremely well done barrel aged Blonde Ale. 
This was a light to medium bodied beer that had more than its fair share of carbonation and a very nice sour and tart aftertaste. This aftertaste had the taste of green grapes, green apples, farmyard funk, French Oak, lemon, and candi sugar. After all the sour and tartness leaves, in comes the candi sugar. The candi sugar leaves behind a sugary and Pixie Stick like aftertaste. It was very interesting. 
This beer aged very well. It aged so well that I wish I had another bottle in my cellar. This was one of those beers that had a lot going on in it, but nothing really controlled this beer. Every flavor and aroma had the same amount of time in the spotlight. I would love another bottle of this! 3,157 charactersAltBock, Aug 02, 2013

From the bottle.
This pours looking like a Belgian wit—it’s a cloudy hazy white-golden in color with great foaming. The aroma has this wonderful, big tartness that dominates. I get some sour cherries coming across and an intense acidity. The flavor fills the mouth with that same tartness before finishing dry and sparkly. Yes, this sparkles on the palate. There, I said it. Wow. Yum. More, please.

It poured with a quarter finger high off white head that quickly died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass. 
S: Moderate aromas of chardonnay wine barrels are present in nose along with notes of sourness from the brett. 
T: The taste is similar to the smell, except that the sourness is a little stronger and there are also hints of oak. 
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. 
O: This beer has a very nice balance between flavors of chardonnay and sourness that makes it both interesting and quite easy to drink.

A: Pours a hazy pale golden yellow in color with light amounts of gentle visible carbonation at the surface of the beer and some apricot highlights. The beer has a quarter to half finger tall pillowy/soapy bright white head that reduces to a thin film covering the majority of the surface of the beer with a slightly thicker ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Light aromas of pale malts with stronger aromas of brett, barnyard funk, tartness/sourness, chardonnay, and oak.
T: Upfront there are light to moderate flavors of pale malts with some moderate to strong amounts of tartness/sourness. There is a strong presence of brett without it dominating or being overbearing and a nice light amount of funkiness. There are moderate flavors of chardonnay and oak towards the finish.
M: Just heavier than light bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation. Slightly creamy with light amounts of acidic prickliness and some light to moderate amounts of dryness in the finish.
O: Extremely easy to drink and interesting due to the great balance of flavors/aromas with just enough complexity. Love the use of brett in this beer because it enhances and does not dominate. 1,238 charactersdbrauneis, Jun 08, 2013

A: poured into a Russian River 'tion' glass to a clear yellow with a small and dense white head that fades to a small pool in the middle and a large collar around the edge of the glass
S: smells of oak, funk and sourness. definitely some bretty goodness on the nose with this one
T: big sourness up front with some nice fruity notes, a bit of oak, slight funk and barnyardy flavor with some more oak. swallow is a nice sour fruitiness that slowly fades with a bit more oak
M: medium in the mouth with soft and ample carb that is just slightly prickly and is quite dry on the finish
O: absolutely phenomenal beer. Words can't express how perfect it is for an American Wild Ale. It's honestly a benchmark beer for a sour blonde 746 charactersSHODriver, Jun 01, 2013

S - pink bubblegum, oak, lacto/pedio sourness, leathery Brett, mild white grape, faint coconut.
T - is like the aroma minus the bubblegum with a pleasant peppery finish. Really nice balance of flavors. Certainly a sour, but not an extreme sour. Elegant without being wimpy. Not overly acidic for the style. 
M - my first 5 rating for mouthfeel. Light-medium body. Slightly oily. Creamy. Effervescent. Dry. Tart. Absolutely delicious with a long aftertaste that does exceptionally naughty things to my tongue. 
O - God damn. This beer is absolutely Fexcellent. (That's effing excellent for the phonetically challenged). I rarely get this excited over a beer, but this one is outstanding for the style from the perspective of a person who is a big fan of the style. 845 charactersGuzzLah, May 18, 2013

We sort of lucked into the other one, finding the Pliny the Elder at a small bottle shop when we were in San Diego for Thanksgiving. I wasn't impressed with that, for an IPA, and sat down with a bottle of Blind Pig last night. Also, thanks to Jeff. It was a good trade, and I am excited to drink all of these "-ation" beers. Oh, and speaking of the Blind Pig… cool story behind the name/meaning. The beer smells WAY better than it tastes, but is still better than Pliny in my opinion. 
Today we are drinking the Temptation, our first in this line of beers. I was excited until I read, "Brettanomyces". I HATE that yeast strain. I mean, HATE with a passion. Every beer I have had that uses that wild yeast has tastes the same. But, words like, "pineapple", and, "citrus" are helping me stay positive about this bottle. If nothing else, it's a beer from a good brewing company with a lot of history. Time to drink. Cheers!
In the Glass: If I didn't know any better, I would think this was a wheat beer. An unfiltered wheat beer, but a wheat beer nonetheless. It pours a thin pale yellow in the glass, and has a nice white head on top. The head is more impressive than I originally would have guessed. I will say, as I was pouring this, I thought I could smell some nice wine notes… but I don't want to get excited, as I am sure the yeast will overpower and spoil this beer for me. 
Nose: Whoa, did NOT expect that. It smells like a sour. I mean, more sour than a typical sour. I am getting, toward the finish, some drying notes that are coming from the barrel that this beer was aged in. Considering the cost and the story behind this entire series, I am stoked to see what this tastes like. Man… what a great aroma. The bros on BeerAdvocate rates this beer 100… and that has got to be rare from them. They don't ever give a beer that high of a rating. 
Flavor: Oh. My. Goodness. That is SO sour. I mean, lip sucking face sucking sour. I did NOT see that coming at all. But I am glad that it did, as I am a big fan of that style. Considering I hate the Brettanomyces yeast strain, I expected this to be pale in comparison. I am not getting much of the wine flavors that I expected to find, but I am sure they are hidden behind the sheer sourness this bottle is presenting. I wasn't a big fan of Russian River until this beer… and that sip has me wanting to take a trip to California! 
Mouthfeel: There are a few bubbles dancing across my tongue as I swallow, but not too many. It's not enough to really notice because of how simply sour this beer is. I am curious to see what Sheryl thinks… I am not sure she likes that style. I hope, because this is amazing! As you finish, a drying flavor would be nice, and the sour flavors are quickly gone… but the mouthfeel is, quite honestly, pretty boring. I am focused on the flavor.
Aftertaste: The sour sticks around for a few minutes, but not as long as I would like. That might actually be a typical experience with sour beers… I haven't had a sour beer that the aftertaste has lasted more than a few second. People are always asking me, "What is your favorite sour beer?" That is tough for me, because there aren't a lot of these out there and the style is not popular among domestic brewing companies. But if I had to pick, from this moment forward, I will be picking this one!
Why can't Russian River ship their beers to me? I want more of this! We have two more bottles from the "-ation" series in the fridge. Can't wait to see what those taste like. I now see why the bros rated this so high. Bravo, Russian River. Cheers! 3,704 charactersrickyleepotts, Apr 18, 2013

A- Pours a clear, pale straw, carbonated body with a white head that rises quickly and reduces to 2" of foam - honestly wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and BMC. I don't judge a book by it's cover, though. Edit: The last pour was more hazy and had particles of yeast in it - I just didn't want to waste any of this beer!
S- I'm getting some belgian style/hefe characteristics here - funky banana and clove, along with acidic lemon, tart sour apple, and some woodiness. 
T- Tart lemon juice, sour green apple, white grapes upfront, transitions into a slight oak and musty leather notes which are extremely pleasant. Aftertaste is slightly spicy with unripe bananas. Nearly perfect. 
M- Crisp, light, refreshing, smooth, easy to drink. 
If this beer wasn't so hard for me to acquire I'd drink it all the time. This is up there with one of my favorite beers - it's so beautifully crafted that it's simply complex, if that makes any sense. Complex in a way that there are so many notes at work, and simple in a way that they all work together perfectly to create an extremely drinkable sour. My favorite of the RR sours (I have not tried beatification though). Must try. 1,304 charactersgcamparone, Mar 20, 2013

Smells of sour green apples, champagne, tart fruit, funk, super yeasty.
Tastes like the cristal of beer. Sour green apples, white grapes, lemons, barnyard brett funk, chardonnay. Very tart.
Mouthfeel is light, bubbly, smooth, nicely carbonated. I'm having a hard time putting this down.
The best sour beer i've ever had. I'm already trying to find another bottle! 410 charactersmnphish, Mar 10, 2013

4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Jeff for sharing this one with me. Pours a golden-yellow color, translucent with lots of light shining through the edges. The foamy white head lasts for a bit as it settles and leaves some big, wet lacing.
The aroma is thoroughly acidic and tart. Sour apple skins, pears, light vinegar, faint lactic aromas. There's a mild woodiness behind all of the tart fruits, but there's no denying that this is a sour bomb. I was a bit shocked to find that there was quite a big vinous character in the aroma, too, until I read that this was aged in chardonnay barrel. Makes sense now. Very tingly on the nostrils, this one's gonna be sour - no doubt.
And sure enough, it is. Temptation is very sour, front and center. We're talking puckering sour, not just "mildly tart". Lemons are huge, as are apples and pears. Wow, this is just so, so, so, SO tart. Each sip feels more tart than the last. It hits the edges and corners of your mouth and gets your face scrunched up in no time. Not as sour as Beatification, still pretty damn tart. Light vinous notes, as well as a mild oak flavor on the tail, but the beer has a mostly sweet finish once that godly tartness finally dies down. Medium bodied, heavily carbonated.
I've come to expect a lot from Russian River, and rightfully so. Temptation delivers. It's a sour motherfucker, that's for sure. If you like sours and you haven't had this yet - get some. Now. 1,414 characterstectactoe, Mar 08, 2013

A: Pale yellow, very transparent and crystal clear. Very foamy white head, steam like with a mix of tiny to medium sized bubbles. Good head retention and lacing. High carbonation with large amount of bubbles being created from the dimple on the bottom of the glass. Very unique looking beer but very attractive. 
S: Very tart on the nose. Sourness is very apparent and comes across almost wine like, "Is it beer, or is it wine?" (Quote from the back of the bottle). Also, a bit floral and a tad bit sweet but dry.
T: Tartness comes first, sourness is nicely tamed. A bit bitter in the middle and finishes sweet with some bitterness as well. Very balanced and extremely drinkable. Very good example of this style and good intro beer for someone unfamiliar with wilds. Obviously a great intro beer for a wine drinker. 
M: Bitterness lingers along with a slight sweetness and dry. 
O: Much more drinkable and not as sour as I was expecting. Not a bad thing at all, actually very enjoyable and refreshing. Finished dry and reminds me much of wine, but yes, it is still a beer. Great friendly American wild and would gladly have someone try this in hopes of converting them to the sour side. 1,234 charactersMarioM, Mar 04, 2013

Pours a pale gold with a finger of foam with some pretty good retention for a wild. Little transparency with the yeast floating around. Medium carbonation coats the glass with some decent lacing. Smell of white wine, sour apple, cherry, and citrus. Some funk blends with a sweet malt and a touch of alcohol. Taste follows the nose well, sour apple and cherry with some chardonnay. A mild malt base mixes with some alcohol and citrus. Pretty solid feel, crisp with medium sourness, not much face twisting as the rest of the Russian River sour line. Good sticky finish. Over all another quality sour from Russian River, however probably my least favorite of the line so far. Can't wait to see how this ages 729 characterslordofstarside, Feb 23, 2013

375 ml bottle poured into a large Duvel snifter.
Appearance: This beer poured a one finger head that reduced to a thin layer. It is a hazy golden yellow with slight clarity and slow moving bubbles coming up through the glass.
Smell: Fruity, oak, vanilla, funky orders, musty, and some spiciness too. 
Taste: This shit tastes great. It's so frickin funky and chardonnay delicious. What a nice blend of Brett and charfonnay flavors.
Mouthfeel: buttery smooth, low to medium carbonation, crisp, refreshing, light to medium bodied, and easy to drink.
Overall: Awesome wild ale. It doesn't get any better. Great beer for my 400th review. 721 charactersFlounder57, Feb 22, 2013

A: Golden yellow to light honey colored with a very small white head that goes away quickly. It looks very clean but it is only semi translucent which I assume is due to time in the barrels 
S: you can definitely smell the chard barrels the brett is there as well but it is not as funky as I have seen it before which in another respect makes the smell pretty balanced its good but not great.
T: The first thing that comes to mind is the following the nose with taste of Chard and oak there is a sour and tart flavor that sticks around for awhile and all throughout the finish. The flavor is nice and light as well as being quite delicious and I usually don't like wine. The brett is also present but in the background and adds a nice crisp taste.
M: there is a nice crisp bite to it is smooth, oily and goes down really easy I had to stoop myself from drinking it too fast. The brett and light carbonation adds a champagne line feel that adds to chard flavor and really combines well in this beer.
O: I really liked this beer its not super sour or funky at all but it is really tasty and goes down really easy. The mouthfeel works perfectly with the taste and although the smell is lacking everything else makes up for it. I would highly recommend this beer get it if you can. 1,307 charactersPinknuggets, Feb 10, 2013

A- Pours a hazy gold color with a 3/4 inch white head that retains well before fizzling away to a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a thin sheet of surface foam. Solid lacing. Wispy sediment is found suspended in the body.
S- Lemony, funky wild yeast aroma with a hint of barnyard must. Crisp but fumy.
T- Pow! Massive sourness of lactic acid assaults the palate leaving only traces of citrus fruit notes. Has that strange rubbery aftertaste that I haven't, as of yet, been able to determine what the cause of it is but it shows up in a lot of sours. Drinkable, but with small sips few and far between.
M- Incredibly dry and twangy with a tartness that doesn't let up. Medium-high carbonation and a lightish body. 
O- It's a kick in the teeth right off the bat but, once you get into it, it's a pretty tasty sour if you like that sort of thing. 926 charactersImmortale25, Feb 10, 2013

4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A-Pours an illuminated toasted straw color. Body is quite hazy. Puffy bleached head sits atop the body. Looks nearly perfect. Long, attention-grabbing lacing stains hug the glass and dry up. 
S-The aroma is Brett at its best. Funky, tart and earthen. Pretty floral notes play quite nicely with the barrel notes. Woody, infected Chardonnay with a light, crisp malty underbelly. Fresh, juicy apples, pears and stone fruits. The buzzing funk encompasses all of the other aromatic components.
T-The flavor is blatantly exquisite. The funky, barny, yeasty tartness rushes over the palate. The sips following the first deliver all the notes from the nose but with much more robustness. Warmth is friendly to this ale. The honeysuckle and dandelion stem flavors add depth. The oak is sneaky but noticeable after a few sips... I may even be getting some oak-imparted vanilla flavors. Tart fruits of course.
M-Perfect body; relatively light and highly carbonated. The first sip seemingly explodes all over my mouth; the bubbles roll over every inch.
O/D-Another royal brew by Russian River. Too complex to ever fully describe. Too drinkable to ever fully feel satisfied. A glass of this at the brewpub was truly inspiring. 1,217 charactersVelvetExtract, Feb 04, 2013

A: Pours light orange with nearly two fingers of a bubbly white head that fairly quickly dissipates to a frothy film. Just a little hazy, but mostly clear. 
S: As soon as I popped the cork the sourness practically jumped out of the bottle. White wine, moderate fruitiness akin to peaches and green apples, lots of sourness and funk. 
T: As I had hoped, the nearly 4 years of aging turned this quite sour and funky. Semi-sweet chardonnay with mild fruits, a lot of oak. Slightest bit lactic. Has a good bit of that funky-cheese and musty basement quality. Tart bite up front with a mouth-puckering sourness lingering through the finish. 
M: Medium body, moderate carbonation. Fairly dry finish. I'd like a little bit more carbonation, slightly lighter body, and a dryer finish. Nitpicks though, it's still darned good.
O: One of the finest examples of it's style and the extended aging made it even better. Near perfection. 1,029 charactersSatchboogie, Feb 04, 2013

A - Pours an initially clear golden amber body. The second pour is obviously quite hazy with some sediment. Massive fluffy bone white head fills the rest of the glass but dies down quickly leaving behind a gorgeous one finger cap. Sticky and soapy lacing with long retention coats the glass after every sip. 
S - Starts off with huge notes of brettanomyces. Barnyard musk, hay, and oak. Layers of fruit; mainly lemons, overripe pears and grape skins. The finish is powdery and dry with a touch of blue cheese. The white wine barrel adds such a great fruit character. Just phenomenal. 
T - Crisp and lively. Sour lemons, ripe pear juice, and tart green grapes. Oak and a musk take over on the finish. Lactic and very tart. Finishes nearly dry. Not over the top sour.
M - Medium bodied with high carbonation. Drinks very easily.
O - Very nice AWA. The aroma is just perfect. Definitely draws some parallels with brett heavy Belgian Pales and the Chardonnay barrel adds a subtle but well implemented angle. 1,117 charactersdavey101, Jan 26, 2013

Appearance: Slightly hazed light gold/straw. Lively carbonation. Head is bubbly, bright-white, and drops to a small cap and chunky, bubbly collar. Some nice lacing as the beer dwindles. Head retention stays small, but constant.
Smell: Fruity and funky. Apple and some pear. Nice solid hit of oak. Backing citric tartness. Pushes toward lemon at times. Slight powdery Brett in the back. White wine and grape skin. A touch of earth. Touches of grass/hay and alcohol. Some lactic sourness as well.
Taste: Yeasty funk. Lactic and citric sour jockey for position. Fruity and floral. Apple core and grape skin. Pushes big notes of chardonnay and oak through the back and finish. Earthy Brett. Some hay and grass. Some pale bready malts give it a little backbone. Peach. Fruity up front, earthy and grassy through the middle. Finishes with a lingering lactic bite. Maybe even some lime thrown in for good measure.
Mouthfeel: Lighter side of medium and dryish. Crisp with a smoothness that defies the carbonation. 
Overall: A chronic case of the "tions." Bother master and erect.
Another Russian River "sour" that does it right. Massively fruity and bit more delicate than some of the others. Refreshing. Some age will probably turn this in to a distilled version of liquid gold. 1,332 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 23, 2013

Appearance- Poured golden clear until the yeast made its way into the glass and then a lovely hazy golden color presided. One finger white foamy head that lasted a short while leaving beautiful lacing.
Smell- Buttery, oaky flavors- oak aged (chardoney). Subdued vinegar with tart grape. Sweet vanilla.
Taste- Earthy. oakiness mixed with soft vanilla and mild white grape flavors. Not as tart as other Russian River sours, but well balanced through the mild sweetness. Musty flavors finish the taste.
Mouthfeel- Lots of little bubbles bursting all around my mouth. Carbonated and smooth.
Overall- This is another great beer from Russian River. If you want a sour that won't make you whole face change, then this is it. 789 charactersSeanniek91, Jan 21, 2013

Purchased: Mail order
Pours a brilliant golden, clear color, with a nice-sized white head. Lacing and head retention are both good. My second pour yields some yeast cloudiness.
Aromas are very wine- and champagne-like, with fruity, grape notes in the forefront. Other smells are sour lemons and some woodiness and mustiness. 
It tastes much as expected from the nose, dry, fruity and sour. This coupled with the fruit and grape flavors really bring out the wine notes from aging in Chardonnay barrels.
Mouthfeel has a prickly carbonation on a medium body. It finishes quite dry and sour, but is tempered by the fruits so as to create a balance.
I'm not too experienced in tasting wild ales, but can say this one is really delightful. I'm looking forward to my next beer from Russian River! 904 characterssommersb, Jan 19, 2013
4.86/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Corsendonk tulip glass. Batch 3.
A - Bright golden color with a thin layer of head. Very nice to look at.
S - Sour, citrus fruits, apples, and a hint of oak.
T - Lemons, oak, chardonnay, and sour funkiness are all dominant in this one. Hints of grapes and sour cherries. Very oaky aftertaste. Extremely well balanced.
M - Light and refreshing with lots of carbonation. Dry aftertaste.
I really loved this one. It's one of the best sours I've had and I thought it was more well balanced than the other RR sours I've had (Supplication and Beatification). Thanks to Douglasjamjak for the awesome extra! 638 charactersRoninTK3, Jan 19, 2013

thanks to matttYCE and beachstrength49 for this one. you guys are awesome!
A: pours a light yellow/orange, head formation is quick and subtle just like a soda. it builds up to about 1/2 fingers worth then quickly fizzles out. there is a slight film that hugs the glass
S: big Brett funkiness that is complemented well by lemons and orange peel. there is a subtle spice hint (possibly a clove?), and a nice slight oak note
T: straight forward AWA in my opinion. very nice balance of citrus oranges, and lemons. vinegar, tartness, and barnyard funk all intermingle nicely together.
M: Chardonnay is extremely evident here in the mouth feel as it leave a nice dryness on the palate. its on the lighter side of medium bodied, and along with the Chardonnay note, it leaves a nice sourness that creates salivation for balance 
O: drinking this makes me wish RR was easier to come by. Its a solid AWA, not overly complex and very nicely balanced. Will definitely want to seek this one out again in the future. 1,032 characterstut2528, Jan 02, 2013

Bright white creamy/foamy mixed head, good retention and lacing, with a beautiful pale golden colored beer beneath. Slightly tame aroma, or should I say more tame than I expected from RR. White wine, lemongrass, hay, slight funk, yeasty, earthy, light notes of what I can only describe as damp basement must, light oak, hint of green apple and lime. The taste runs along the same lines but with more white wine/grape, more grassy notes, more lemon tart and sour than the nose, and pleasantly so. Again plenty of earthiness, hay, light oak, and how I can only imagine a damp musty basement might taste. Light medium, slightly filmy consistency, medium carbonation, and a smooth, light body. Finish leaves the puckering sourness just lightly coating the mouth and throat.
Once again, a stupendous American Wild Ale from Russian River. As I've said previously they have all been wonderful but had their own great twists and I find myself craving each at different times depending on my mood. Temptation is a bit more subdued compared to Consecration or Supplication but is probably a bit more intense than Sanctification. Take that with a grain, but give any of them a try if you get the chance. 1,233 charactersmatttttYCE, Dec 30, 2012

4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pours hazy blonde like a wheat beer with more sufficient lacing. 
The aroma is white wine, funk and some yeast. Similar to RR's other wild ales, but slightly more tame.
The taste is moderately acidic with slight vinegar. Lemon citrus forms a background but doesn't impose itself. I get some grapefruit notes as well. Balanced, but it seems to be fairly simple.
The body is medium thin with slightly more carbonation than the norm. Finishes dry.
Overall, this is quite well balanced and well made, but I feel like the wine and Brett dominated it. Not a bad problem to have, but it made it harder to find the underlying beer. 627 charactersBBP, Dec 24, 2012

Great beer/wine brew. 301 charactersOakenator, Dec 22, 2012

Appearance: Typical golden belgian blonde color with a medium-sized pure white head
Nose: Initial aromas are of bitter lemon and sour cherry with a sweeter green grape undertone. Deeper in the nose hints of the classic Chardonnay butterscotch oak characteristics and a bit of smoke comes though.
Taste: Tart lemons and cherries with toasty bread and apple cider underneath. Finish with that vanilla, woodsy oak flavor and a hit of funky gasoline. 
Mouthfeel: Nothing special overall but for a sour it was surprising lively. 
Overall: Really refined, complex, tasty wild-fermented sour. A standout in a recent tasting of wine-barrel aged brews. 683 charactersfdig23, Dec 20, 2012

T: Tart cherries and lemony sourness dominate the flavor with some musty and funky flavors underneath. Simple, but enjoyable.
M: Medium-light body with medium carbonation, this beer is crisp enough to accentuate the sour and tart notes well.

Smell - Lots of yeast notes with a mix of that barnyard smell you would find in a saison. Also a hint of sweetness lots brings to mind white grapes
Taste - An explosion of wild tart right off the bat. Tons of white grapes and champagne like flavor. Middle of the sip you start to notice the yeast and slightly bready notes. Aftertaste is that of a saison with the wood presence making itself known. Leaves the mouth quite dry after
Mouthfeel - Very carbonated and thin, exactly like champagne. Perfect for the style though
Overall - Another Russian River sour and another fantastic beer. This always seems to be the case with them and I am once again extremely pleased and could drink this one all night. 792 charactersWiscoBrewsco, Dec 07, 2012

S- Sour funk, grape must, citrus, pears, some earthy aromas and oak.
T- Wine-like flavors come through first with oak comes through a lot in the middle, with the sour tart flavors blasting the palate at the end. The tart flavor has very fruity citrus-like flavors that come through a lot.

A- Pours a nice golden with a half finger of head that recedes fairly fast and leaves some spotty lacing. Fairly minimal carbonation.
S- Chardonnay, grapes, a hint of green apple, brett contributing some barnyard funk, a little bit above average aroma strength.
T- Chardonnay, grapes, decent amount of sourness although not as much as I was expecting that mixes with some barnyard funk, some oak, finishes with a decent tartness and lingering fruits.
M- Medium bodied, fairly low carbonation, very high drinkability.
O- This was a very nice sour, but definitely not my favorite. This bottle seemed like it might have had a little bit less carbonation (it didn't effect the beer that much though). The barrel aging definitely contributed a nice presence to the sour. I would definitely recommend trying this beer out but I definitely like some of RR's other sours better (might be because I'm not as big of a fan of blonde ales as being the bases for sours). 1,031 charactersjaasen64, Nov 10, 2012

Pours a light yellow diaphanous with a solid fine white quilt. Smells of lemon, funk, zesty tartness and some nice pithy character. Flavor is sour with a good farmy, tart, hints of bicarb, some bits of pepper and a nicely refreshing finish. Thin with hi carb and watery finish. This might be one of my preferred RR beers. Really a beautiful brew.

Batch 05x1F
A: c&c bottle pops and pours a light golden ale with excellent clarity. Atop is a blanket of white head which is constantly refilled with a continuous persistence of bubbling.
S: Oranges, limes, classic tart scent. Great smell.
T: Tart, farmy, with largely bitter head. Somegrassy tones.Very good.
M: Light body with excellent carbonation. Great feel and finish on the tongue.
D: This beer is wonderful. I can say I prefer supplication to this one. But when available, I still buy it. 896 charactersharrymel, Nov 04, 2012

Appearance: The beer pours a slightly cloudy golden straw color with a mild amber hue. There is a finger of thick, off white head that sticks around quite nicely. 5
Smell: This is a light sour beer. I'm getting a strong barnyard funk presence. It dominates the smell, but it isn't particularly biting. I'm also getting a mild sweetness and a hint of white wine. 4
Taste: Light and sour, but not to an extreme level. I'm getting some lemon juice and funk up front with some more herbal notes building towards the finish. The sourness builds to the finish if the sip, which also contains a white wine note. Reminds me of a mild lambic. 4
Mouthfeel: The body is on the lighter side with smooth carbonation and a finish that is dry but could be drier. 3.5
Overall: I would call this a pleasant sour blonde ale. It's not overly biting or sour. I don't really have a guess as to what this one is, but I like it. 4 956 charactersoline73, Oct 30, 2012

A: Slow slow pour to prevent yeast sediment. Light foamy 3 finger head with good retention, leaving little lacing but a good cap. Beer is a light copper. 
S: Very wine-like, tart grapes, cherries, and apples. Some of the mustiness associated with the Brett yeast.
T: Quite citrus-like, a lot of lemon, orange type flavor. A little bit sour, but not overpoweringly so. Well-balanced.
M: Not overpowering, carbonation present, but not too much. Sour, but not too dry. Very little alcohol presence evident.
O: I always say this: It's a Russian River bottle-aged sour ale. What are you waiting for? Get one if you can. 742 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Oct 20, 2012

Wow. Incredible... white grapes, clove, funky love, dandelion, lemongrass, incredibly dynamic, complex, like nothing else I can think of.
Lemon zest, loads of tasty pulp, beautifully tart and dry, approachable, hints of fresh wood - incredibly balanced. A remarkable beer.
This beer achieves the same complexity found in Beatification without the overwhelming level of sour patch tart. Phenomenal.

3.67/5  rDev -16.8%look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This is the first American Wild Ale I've ever had, so with no basis for comparison I will be as fair as possible. Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Golden yellow with a thin head that has staying power. Rests comfortably and consistently throughout the drink. There is a thin tornado-like strip of carbonation rising directly in the middle of the glass. Impressive.
Smell: The aroma does absolutely no justice to the beer. A bitter, dare I say, dry urine tinged smell.
Taste: As expected, a burst of chardonnay but not overwhelmingly or bitingly so. Sits on the tongue before lifting throughout the mouth. A touch sour and unusual (perhaps briny) to the untrained tongue but settles in nicely after a few sips rather than keeping you guessing. However it does bite the back jaw with the sourness the deeper you get into it.
Feel: Nice smooth finish with near perfect carbonation.
Very interesting. My quest to finish the top 100 opens up yet another door that I will be walking back through. 1,015 charactersjimilayne, Oct 10, 2012

Nose reminds me of berliner weisse? But additional Brett and a touch of Chardonnay. Very pleasant. 
Pale gold - looks gorgeous. Seems super carbonated yet a nice light head. Interesting how bubbles come up directly from the center of bottom of glass? This actually does look like the champagne of beers... 
Taste is wheat, lemon grass and a tiny bit of funk up front...quickly followed by this lovely explosion of Brett and Chardonnay. I’m not even a huge Chard fan, but this is the perfect amount of winey oak in the taste. Very refreshing and in my opinion the perfect amount of tartness. 
While carbonation is strong, it doesn't feel overly bubbly like champers would be - really nice mouthfeel.

Pours a glowing bright yellow that is cloudy with yeast and a decent size white head that has good retention and leaves sheets of beautiful lacing. Aroma is chardonnay, white grapes, champagne. Taste reminds me of a geuze minus the barnyard funk. At first there is a nearly mouth puckering sourness that overwhelms the palate for an instant. Then it goes from sweet to sour to bitter dryness back to wet sourness in all of about three seconds. Woah. There is some hop bitterness that reminds you this is a wild ale and not white wine. Was loved by all the wine lovers in the room. A big hit. Would be an excellent gateway beer to move someone from wine to beer snobbery. 12/27/2009 8/5/8/5/16=4.2
FULL VERTICAL TASTING
375mL b1. First batch of Temptation has gained quite the phenolic, plastic nose. The body is not too sour but rather sweet with minimal tartness. Finish is very dry. This batch isn’t aging so well.
375mL b2 pours with much higher carbonation and a gorgeous head. Aroma here is such spot on: cotton candy, funk, chardonnay, white grapes. Excellent body with some spicy sourness, sweet tropical fruits, candy. Very nice. This is the best batch by far.
375mL b4 pours with a giant head. Nose is losing complexity with sweet vanilla and birthday cake. Taste is watery, much too sweet. Either too young or just not up to par. 1,423 characterstarheels86, Oct 02, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25yet another one of the "tion" brews under my belt, and while its not the consecration, it is a hell of a damn good beer. it pours a murky pale blonde color with some flaoting sediment and a frothy white head just half an inch high and relaxing to less than that, but always ready to come back to life with a shake or a swirl. it smells like brett and wine acidity, grapey and musty, oaky and dank, really nice. lighter though than some of the other beers from this line, less in my face. it has a really unique flavor, somewhere between a glass of white wine and a beer. the sour element sneaks up on you too, its just a tart golden ale at first, but then after a few seconds the sour really hits you in the face. almost jaw hurting. dry as hell in the finish. i love the fruit in this, lighter than the heavy cherry stuff in the others, refreshing and surprisingly drinkable. the feel is epic, like all of these. its so so dry at the end, and the carbonation is crazy bright. body is lighter too, and i just love the sour puckey feeling i get from this. overall another, yet another, brilliant brew from the masters.
edit: just had a batch 4 bottle of this, maybe 09 or something, im not sure the date, but it was even more dry and awesome than was the fresh one i had a year or so ago. cellar this, its worth the patience! 1,325 charactersStonedTrippin, Sep 29, 2012

A-Opened with a nice pop and poured golden in color. Mostly clear with lots of ultra-fine carbonation. The off-white head started at three fingers in height and stuck around for a long time, leaving nice lacing on the glass.
S-Oaky and vinous at first with hints of tart apple and grapes. I could tell this beer was aged in white wine barrels. There is just a touch of yeasty funkiness that grows as the brew warms up. 
T-Starts out with tart apples, grapes, a little vinegar, and lemon curd. As it warms up, the flavor turns more to the sour cherry side, but it never gets all the way to sour cherries. The taste is not as oaky or vinous as the smell, but it is quite complex and concentrated. 
M-Lighter to medium bodied with lots of fine, champagne-like carbonation. It is just a touch creamy with a dry, tartness that mellows some on the finish.
O-I really enjoyed this beer; one of my favorite American Wild Ales to date. It had a nice complex dose of sourness and a touch of yeasty goodness, which really played well with the level of carbonation. I could drink a lot of this...if it weren't so damned expensive. 1,178 charactersspoony, Sep 26, 2012

Smells of lemonheads with a touch of cherry clan. Immediately after opening it smells nice. Shortly after it starts to smell a little stale. 
Taste follows the nose. Tastes like the tart side of Lemon Heads. Kind of one note but not bad. 
Light bodied and crisp mouthfeel with high carbonation. 
Overall I think it's very very similar to Beatification, but I like this one better. 462 charactersMrVonzipper, Sep 25, 2012

A: Pours a murky/cloudy straw yellow. A tiny 1 finger head is present but quickly dissipates. Tons of lacing.

T: Complex. Lots of stuff going on here. Tart and Funky, lemon, white wine, oak and finish try and tart.
M: Light body, medium carbonation.
O: Mind = Blown. This stuff is insanely good. Initially it seems simple but the more you drink, the more it evolves. Everything in this beer just works extremely well together. Well done, RR, well done. 587 charactersWesM63, Sep 22, 2012
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375ml Bottle from batch 003 
Pours out with just a hint of hazy on a golden background with a fluffy white head that persists forever with massive stickage. The aroma is quite vinous with a sour funky edge. Grapes, lemons, cherries, plums, oranges, tartness, sweaty horses its all in there and it smells great. The first sip pierces my tongue with lactic but smooths out quite quickly. Grapes, candy sugar, brown sugar come up front and provide a great balance against the lemons sour cherries and apricots that come in next. A bit of lactic and funk find its way in there towards the finish but smooth out with a fruity sweetness. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet tart mouthfeel. This is a beautiful beer! Wonderfully complex and incredibly drinkable. I've had this in the cellar a few years and have lost track of where I got it, if you sent it to me thank you so much. 899 charactersjohnnnniee, Sep 21, 2012

S: Wonderful tropical fruit, floral notes, brett, and supported subtly by the oak and funk. 
T: A moderate sourness carries through most of the mouthful. The blonde ale peeks through, esp. on the long finish, along with some tannins, but is hidden beforehand by the tartness, floral white wine-like flavors.
M: Medium body and medium-light carbonation, wonderfully crisp and refreshing.
O: Fantastic. This stuff is so good it's dangerous, not from an ABV standpoint but the price point (like sushi). Pairs very well with food, where you would otherwise drink a white wine. 726 characterspmarlowe, Sep 17, 2012

S: A great lemon tartness is there initially on the nose. A dry white wine with some light green grape.
T: Great lactic sourness. Really puckering at the jowls. Tart lemon, white wine, white grapes and fresh green grape tartness. Unripened pear Dried oak with a light barrel sweetness. Definite funkiness in the periphery. 
M: Light bodied with a drying, sweet finish. Nice prickly carbonation as well.

4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I received this bad boy in a trade some time ago and feel that after a couple of years, I should probably get to crushing it. Review is from notes taken on 9/3/2012 and poured from the bottle (batch 004X3) to a snifter.
Appearance: Pour is a light, crispy golden straw color; starts with 1/4 finger creamy, slightly off-white head with good retention; head fades to a full, lush cap; body is mostly clear, just a touch of haze on the glass, so the body has great clarity; plenty of carbonation bubbling up quickly in thin streams; big swaths of lacing are left in curtains and trails on the sides of the glass.
Smell: Light tart green grapes; touch of saccharine funk with a bit of barnyard mulchiness to it; smell is crisp, refreshing -- like a chilled white wine with nice tartness.
Taste: Wow - might be one of the easiest drinking wilds I've had to date -- the funk and tartness there, and it makes me want to pucker a little bit, but it fades rather quickly and allows the tart grape flavors and touch of mulchiness; bit of an acidic/vinegar-like bite flavor.
Mouthfeel: Body is rather light in terms of weight, and again, the tartness does create a pucker but it's manageable and fades rather quickly; a rather sticky and moderately thick coating all over the palate; I'm left salivating.
Overall: I didn't think RR could top Consecration, but they did with this particular beer. I wish I had access to their work on a regular basis, so I feel like every time I drink a beer of theirs that I crack from my closet I'm robbing myself of a future delight, but if I don't drink it, I'm robbing myself of a current delight. Damn you, Vinny, for being so good. 1,665 charactersbamadog, Sep 04, 2012

T - Tart grapes, crisp green apples, and lemon dance on the tongue creating a nice crisp tartness. A light dusty funk appears mid palate finishing crisp and tart with some snappy lemon acidity.
M - Light body, effervescent carbonation that turns smooth at the end, nice tartness with a crisp dry finish.
I've been sitting on this for almost 2 years but it's felt like 5! I had to crack it open tonight. 
Very light and crisp with nice wood notes. Funkiness was there but not over the top. Sour but not puckering. The chardonnay is pronounced but is nice. Just a subtle, but very well done sour. 878 charactersStaveHooks, Jul 28, 2012

Smell is crisp and clean and sweet, but pungently sour at the same time. Smells absolutely delightful, as each sniff brings aromas in slightly different waves. Tart, clean, and dry. Yum. Edit: after tasting it, I can go back and find a bit of white wine grapes, but barely.
Flavor doesn't wow me as much. It's heavy on the chardonnay, with way more white grape than I picked up in the smell, and with a slightly biting dryness (the same thing that makes me pucker when I drink chardonnay). White grapes and oak, overpowering all of the subtle sour-sweet that was so dominant in the smell. I feel like I'm drinking a beerish white whine, rather than a beer.
Mouthfeel is delightful, and fits the beer really well. Like the appearance, it reminds me of champagne, with a huge burst of bubbles that fills the mouth and carries the flavors to every corner. Finish is very dry and slightly acidic.
On balance, this is a good beer. It's just unfortunate that the flavor is my least favorite part. It's dominated by the barrel in the same way that many rough bourbon-barrel-aged beers are. I want more beer, or more sour, and less chardonnay. 1,485 characterszeledonia, Jun 13, 2012

A - Bright gold, mostly clear, fluffy white head that retains and laces well.

T - Woody barrel notes, green grape, vinous, strong yeast funk, brett earthiness, hay, sour, but not too overpowering. Long finish with lingering sourness.
M - Light side of a medium body, high carbonation, stays smooth and sour, with a bit of a pucker.

A rich bouquet of aromas burst out of the tulip including hints of oak, chardonnay, green apple and brettanomyces funk. The brew starts out with a fruitiness reminiscent of pears before a quaint oakiness leads other flavors like vanilla and chardonnay grapes into a tart and funky finish. A high level of carbonation dances across the tongue in this medium bodied ale. Maybe our new favorite sour, and that says a lot!

4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 006. Poured from a bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. Beautiful clear gold color with a rather small white head. On the nose I get some apple skins, pears, and a slight touch of barnyard funk.
Medium-bodied beer with a nice mellow fruity, tart flavor. The sour notes hit you immediately as the beer touches your tongue. Despite the fruit on the nose, there's not much sweetness to balance it out. What there is though, is a nice stony champagne-like dryness. There are fruity dry notes that linger well on the finish. Very appetizing beer.
This is not my favorite sour from Russian River (that is still Supplication), but this is an excellent beer. The combination of fruit, sour, and stony dryness makes this beer taste like a nice mellow gueuze. Fans of sours (and gueuzes) should definitely try to get this. It's wonderful that an American brewer is making such unique, distinctive beers, but it's criminal that they aren't distributed more widely. Here in KY, we have to trade for them. And when I say we ``have to'' trade, I mean we absolutely must. There's just nothing like these anywhere outside of California. 1,131 charactersdeadonhisfeet, May 23, 2012

Tart nose and really funky. Like, serious funk. Really faint melon maybe.

Thinnish but not watery.

4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours pale straw, light gold; slight cloudiness. Condensed white head has little staying power, leaving a thin film. Remarkable lacing forms.
Smells of bright, tart lemon and grapes (in the sense of white wine). Mild funk, mild sourness. Very light oak.
Lemon is strong initially while the beer is still chilled, and then the sour cherry takes center stage, all the while green apple is in the background. Subtle sourness, with a light lactic bite, tart.
Light bodied, but far from watery; High carbonation makes it fluffy, and effervescent. Finishes dry with a lingering soft mouth puckering and tingling sour note.
Though not immediately 'wowed' by this beer, i fell deeply in love with it during the session. Its subtle and delicate, yet bright and bold. Some great fruity notes, paired with some soft sourness. Being aged for nearly a year in oak barrels, i was expecting more wood in the aroma (very light) and finish (nonexistent). Stellar mouthfeel. I am very jealous of those whom have this at their local liquor stores throughout the year. 1,052 charactersGrohnke, May 18, 2012

Smells heavily of chardonnay. White grapes, some apple, a load of oak, butter and some brett.
White wine flavors abound. Buttery vinous flavor. Brett is more prevalent than the nose indicates, but still well integrated. Sour apple and cherry come out a bit more as warmed. Sourness is not strong up front but leaves the back of the tongue pucker.
Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation.
Very pleasant beer. Well integrated complex flavors. I prefer this to its closest kin Sanctification. 572 charactersjmarsh123, May 16, 2012

4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Picked this one up from a Whole foods in the South San Francisco Bay Area. The 350ml bottle came in a cage and cork arrangement. The glass was particularly heavy I'm guessing to facilitate Russian River's bottle fermented beers.
On with the review.
A- Beautiful, ususlly I love a cloudy golden coloring but this bright orange beer blew me away. The most interesting thing about the poor was that bits of barrel sediment made it through so the bubble cascade looked like falling stars ... unreal.
S- Striking. When popped the quark the first smell to come out was sweet, like root beer sweet. To which i had to respond "Well lets keep and open mind". But after the pour all sorts of intense citrus and mango and sweet orange came to the front. The famous sour cherry didn't seem to come till later on. 
T- Like nothing else. Right now Russian River Brewing have the uncanny ability to bring to your pallet the sensation of something you have never tastes before. Cherry carbonation, mild wheat body, with a strong cherry finish. Not strange but unique and wonderful.
M- The first couple sips allow you to feel and explore the carbonation from barrel sediment which in this case is awesome. Later on at the beer warms and smooths out, not exceptionally drinkable but pleasant.
D- Majesty. Its beers like this that make me proud to be from California. 1,356 charactersRedBeard88, May 13, 2012

pours a luminous golden/straw yellow while yielding about a finger of white head; so-so retention that mostly recedes into a ring around the sides of the glass. decent lacing.
chardonnay leads the way in the aroma, followed by oak, fruits, and some subtle notes of both funk and tartness. first sip delivers that vinous quality up front with some oak and funk. as it warms more fruit characteristics (green apple, pear, lemon) open up, along with a touch of hoppiness and spices. a pleasant sourness courses throughout; a dry finish. easily one of the more interesting, original beer i've had to date. for my money the creme de la creme in its style (and i am rating with style heavily in mind here).
light-bodied, tangy mouthfeel, pretty well carbonated. one you'll want to nurse and savor.

Batch 006
written from notes taking a few months ago
A: Pours a translucent yellow amber with just over 1 fingers width of snow white head. Head dissipates down to a thin film, but leaves a solid amount of lacing. 
S: Funky yeast can be smelled as soon as you pop the cork. Sour apple and sour lemon with sweet aromas to balance out the sour, including banana and a subtle vanilla. The brett and sour characters are certainly present but there are also some traditional Belgium yeast aromas coming through. A grassy aroma as well, and even a peppery spice. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced so many different scents coming from one beer. Wow. 
T: Sour apple and sour grape are noticed right away, followed by the chardonnay flavor. There is some of that belguim yeast banana flavor (that I love) that lingers in the after taste, and does a nice job of balancing out the sour. At one point I catch a hint of hop bitterness that I certainly wasn’t expecting. There is a champagne character to the beer as well. Its like a champagne/white wine/gueuze hybrid, and I like it. Doesn’t quite live up to the nose, as not as many flavors come out, but how could it. Still damn good though. 
M/D: Light, crisp and refreshing. A lively mouth feel. Good drinkability as I could certainly drink more than 1 of these, and I can’t say that about all sours. 
O: Overall, this is definitely a keeper. Damn expensive ($13.99 for a 375mL!) but worth it. Great job of creating the sour aura, but maintaining balance and drinkability. I would certainly recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys wild ales, sours, and to those who are just in the mood for something different and unique. 1,716 characterszac16125, Apr 28, 2012

A slight haze in a bright golden body, not a very lively pour with just a thin white cap, doesn't look like there's much carbonation in the glass but two rings of lace 
S the funk is pretty mild but hard too miss, apple, pear, with lots oaked vinous notes, the funk comes out as it warms, smells great
T more vinegar and cider notes I didn't really pick up on in the nose, other then that thankfully it mimics the smell quite well, the barrel leaves its mark on this one and I'm loving it
M more bubbles then I would have guessed but could use just a few more but it's a minor issue, its sour but not turning my mouth inside-out, and just a faint aftertaste 
O this bottle was nowhere near big enough, I smell, I sip, and before I know it I'm smelling an empty glass and bottle. although there's room for improvement I wouldn't change much 
the more sours I drink the more I like them and this is a great example, I like the Chardonnay barrel choice it works quite well, once again I need to thank the most awesome Rutager for this one 1,107 characterswordemupg, Apr 17, 2012

3.87/5  rDev -12.2%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4My first Russian River beer. Guess I'm officially a cool, beer snob now...
THE APPEARANCE of the Temptation ale (btw, 7.5% not 7.25%) was not impressive but not terrible. It's extremely effervescent with a 3/4-inch airy white foam head bubbling up to the top. It has virtually no lacing at all. Basically looks like apple cider or a heavily-filtered hefeweizen in color.
THE SMELL, wow, very pungent. I could smell this beer from several feet away after popping the cork and pouring it out. The aromas I picked up are champagne, chardonnay, green apples, apricot, and yeast.
THE TASTE is extremely vinegary. Cider vinegar is the main flavor with some mild hopping. It is a little peppery and there is a strong skunky, wild mushroom flavor also. Alcohol is hidden. The flavor is strong but it is really quite simple, and straightforward--which is kind of a shame considering the extra labor involved in creating this beer. Starting with a blonde ale was a wise choice for making this style; too much hoppyness would have made the tartness overwhelming (I once had a sour ale at Deschutes Brewery's pub that must have started with a fairly hoppy pale ale. It exemplified how NOT to make a sour ale. Might as well have drank vinegar).
THE FEEL of this odd ale is by far the high point. It's amazingly smooth, dry and sticky on the lips, with a fair amount of alcohol burn in the back of the throat. Altogether, these are odd sensations but are enjoyable and mild. Overall, this is a light beer.
CONCLUSION: This beer is not for everyone, obviously. I tend to agree with the low-end reviews for this brew more so than the high ones. Truthfully, it's mostly hype. The fancy bottle, complicated process, high price, and perceived exclusivity of Russian River's brews are great marketing but do nothing to enhance the taste of Temptation. The best thing this has going for it is that it's a great thirst quencher in the same vein as a Bavarian hefeweizen. On its own it's just a little one-sided and boring. I'd recommend treating it like wine and having it with food. On the other had, you could always just buy some wine... 2,123 charactersMadeInOregon, Apr 05, 2012

Score: 92
Batch #6. Brewed on 05/10/09 and bottled on 08/08/11. Served in a Surly Darkness snifter and enjoyed on 03/20/12.
Appearance: Pours an incredibly hazy golden color with a half finger of bubbly white head that settles into a bubble ring around the glass. Above average lacing, poor retention. 4/5
Smell: Chardonnay, white wine, oak, fizzy light fruit, rose pedal, light "Brett" and only a hint of sweaty sock funk and vinegar once it reaches room temperature. Very light hint of yeast. Surprisingly pleasant. 4.5/5
Taste: Sweet white wine/Chardonnay flavor and fruit. Moderate tartness that grows as the beer warms. Some light wheat, oak and a growing modicum of sweet vinegar. There is a light "funk" when it hits room temperature, but this beer is surprisingly balanced. No real pucker or cringe, which I am enjoying. 4/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, high carbonation. Smooth, sugary and crisp. 4.5/5
Overall: At least at this point in my beer journey, I hate sour. Alas, I legitimately enjoyed this beer. I would certainly come back to this one again. Thank you slvrmon82 and n00b BIF for hooking me with a sour I did not hate.
Recommendation: This is a good beer for fans of white wines and a good "starter sour" for folks like myself that despise sours.
Pairings: Chicken Parmesan.

A: It uncorks with an almighty pop. Very little head, but a few bubbles. Clear urine yellow. Combined with an initial whiff, this is not very appetising.
S: So it actually smells pretty great. Lots of Brettanomyces, but tempered and pleasant, perhaps due to the chardonnay barrels. Some vinegar, some light fruit, and some funky yeast.
T/M: Finally, a sour I can dig my teeth into and really appreciate! This is some good stuff. Not-quite-ripe grapes, strong white wine influence, very subtle tartness. A delicate mouthfeel accentuates the light fruits in the flavour -- bright citrus, fermented grapes, dry-sweet tropical fruits. Very little carbonation; wet and smooth.
O: I have oft claimed to "not like sours," which is largely true, but this something else altogether. Phenomenal! Truly amazing. Highly recommended. Will drink again. A beer to sip and to savour. 981 charactersAgentMunky, Mar 16, 2012

A: Pours crystal clear with less than a finger of white head. The amount of bubbles racing to the top of my Russian River -tion glass is quite impressive. The bubbles hold the small amount of head in place forever, and the lacing is great.
S: The aroma is really focused on the sour end of the wile ale spectrum. Light, with some yeast, hay, and barnyard funk, the aroma certainly follows the idea of a sour blonde ale. I can't say, however, that I'm getting a lot of wine or notes from the barrel. A little too average for me.
T: The sour is there, but not in an overwhelming sense. The base blonde ale is the focus here, and is light with some funk as well. Lemon, some citrus, and grapes. I think I'm getting some of the barrel on the taste. Certainly some wine-like characteristics showing up, and probably some oak. It's very well balanced and clean drinking for a nice day out on the balcony.
MF: Light, with a lot of carbonation. Clean finish and very drinkable. The sour is just enough that it doesn't destroy the palate after putting down the whole bottle.
O: I really liked this. It won't blow you away like some of the other RR sours, but it's nothing to scoff at. Well thought out beer that I would certainly get again. 1,248 charactersrusswbeck, Mar 11, 2012

Pours a clear golden color with a tan head that settles to nothing. Small streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some fruity and grain aromas. Taste is pretty much the same and there is an acidic quality on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good wild ale but I think this one smells better than it tastes. 501 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 05, 2012

Small white head that falls fast, leaving only a thin band on top. Hazy apricot color, sheets of creamy lace left behind clinging to the glass.
Tart, fruity aroma. Granny smith. Noticeable brett note. Musty, funky undertone. More than a hint of chardonnay. 
Medium levels of tartness and sourness in the flavor, hints of oak, white grape, nice brett character, lemon, other citrus fruits. Very mildly sweet. A little puckering in the finish, but not too much. Bitterness emerges just a bit in the aftertaste. Again, the mustiness and funk is there but it's well integrated. Good white wine flavor, more than just chardonnay...white Bordeaux? It has that acidic green apple thing you get in certain tart white wines.
Spritzy carbonation, clean and crisp, with a dry finish. Quite refreshing. Overall a delicious and beautifully crafted beer with moderate sourness and funk characteristics. 935 characterstobelerone, Mar 03, 2012

A - Pours a beautiful golden hue with a light one finger head that fades to leave a super thin cloud resting atop the golden hue.
S - Very mellow nose here. Light funk and must with some slight sweetness. As it warmed some light cherry and stone fruits began to come out.
T - Taste is good sour fruits, especially as it warmed. There is light mustiness and light wild ale funk. As it warms more sour fruits come out like cherries and peaches.
M - Smooth, light carbonation. Incredibly drinkable and a great sour finish.

The pour was a murky medium yellow with an average sized (1-2 finger) white frothy head that reduced to just a thin foamy film that hung to the sides of the glass thus producing some excellent sheeting of lace.
The aroma was harsh of a grain malt and a funky moldy yeast (Brett) with notes of peach, pears, lemon and a winey oak scent.
The taste was slightly sweet and tart with a note of peach in the beginning then quickly got extremely sour with a big dose of citrus and a hint of wine and wood at the end. The flavor stuck around for a good long while after the swallow with a nice sour citrusy taste left to lie on the taste buds.
Mouthfeel was just a tad under medium in body with a nice dry creamy texture and an extremely lively carbonation.
Overall a seriously sour brew with great notes of citrus, wine and oak. Which all together make this a very delectable tasting beer. 923 charactersKajII, Feb 13, 2012

A - Pours out a beautiful golden color with a small white head on the edges of the glass.
S - Just WOW! Everything you could hope for in a wine barrel aged sour. Lots of funk and sour with some chardonnay character, not as much wine in the nose as Supplication.
T - Doesn't quite match up to the intensity of the nose, but starts off sour and finishes dry and tart.
M - Light and bubbly carbonation, but not too thin.
O - Another fantastic sour from Russian River. Supplication is still my favorite sour by them, but Temptation is a very close second. Cheers! 692 charactersHandbanana88, Feb 10, 2012

S- Smells of white grapes, Brett funk, green apple peels, lemons, white wine, oak. Smells extremely refreshing, not as intense as supplication. 
T- Front palate is very slightly sweet and extremely tart. Green apple and a bit of bitterness evident here. Mid palate is where the white wine/grapes really shine through. Back end is a lingering bitterness with a load of Chardonnay characteristics. Awesome.

Pours a cloudy, light orange with a small white head that lingers and laces.
Smells of white wine, brett, some sweetness and subtle, floral notes. Really heavy white-wine grape scent that blends perfectly with the brett aroma. Can't imagine much more inviting than this.
Taste is up front puckering sour that holds through the middle giving notes of pineapple, apple, and the distinct brett funk. There is a white wine character...just damned perfectly balanced flavors. Think brett and white wine with floral notes.
High carbonation and lighter body are perfect. The high, mouth puckering sourness is just fantastic.
An utterly amazing and hugely sour beer. 676 charactersTenHornsProud, Feb 07, 2012

Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
Batch 006
This will be my first American Wild Ale, I cannot wait to see how they compare to my beloved Belgian Lambics! Thanks to futura123 for hooking me up! 
Appearance: Temptation has a lightly hazed, golden-yellow body, topped by a good sized white head that displays good retention and leaves some patchy lace. 
Smell: Tart fruits dominate the nose with lemons, white grapes and green apples. White wine is easily identifiable as is oak and musty brett. As the beer warms light spices (white pepper) and sweeter fruits (cooked apples and hints of sweet melon and orange) become apparent, as does the faintest floral/leafy note. 
Taste: As with the nose, the taste is dominated by tart fruits (white grapes, lemons and green apples), musty brett and white wine (more prominent than in the nose and easily identified as Chardonnay). Oak, light spicing and a touch of sweetness are also noted. As the beer approaches room temperature the Chardonnay character increases dramatically. Perfect Abv. cover, this may as well be 5%. 
Mouthfeel: This is the one department in which I think Temptation stands up to its lambic cousins! Medium bodied with stunningly smooth, expansive carbonation. I could literally gulp this down - pity this is not a 750ml bottle!
Nice acidic bite, but far from enough to pucker the mouth. The finish is quite wine like with a refined dryness. 
Overall: Temptation is a solid sour with stunning white wine character, however I feel it lacks the power and depth of a true lambic (particularly in the nose). That said, I think it is for that very reason that it scores so well on BA! 1,690 charactersThehuntmaster, Feb 07, 2012

Effervescent and golden straw in color, Temptation comes with perfect clarity. Apple cider vinegar, fermented berries, champagne, chardonnay and a touch of oak come through in the bouquet. A soft Brett character is carried throughout the flavor via the active carbonation bubbles that last throughout the tasting. Very wine like, this RR Sour is immediately reminiscent of a carbonated white wine that finishes dry. Oak follows through from the nose.
Though I admittedly am not a fan of sours for the most part, this was a toast to a friend who once did. Very drinkable and palatable. Would work well with a sharp white cheddar cheese if one would like to compliment. 740 charactersseedsofchaos, Feb 07, 2012

The aroma is of tart grapes and slight malted grain. The lacing is noticable and there is a bite of crisp and sharp flavors when sipping this one. It is a sipper unless you were born with an affinity to tartness. The alcohol is well hidden and the there is a heavy infusion of Chardonney from the aging process. I am quite impressed with my first sample from RR wild ale series. 460 charactersphishgator, Feb 03, 2012
4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375 mL bottle poured into an RR -tion glass. Batch 006. Served a touch too cold at 45F.
Appearance - Remarkably clear golden yellow body. Not a lot of head. Biggish bubbles that settle quickly. The lacing is nice and bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass like champagne.
Smell - Chardonnay is most prominent. Oaky with a nice lemon tartness. Funky, but not like a lambic. Complex aroma, but it isn't overwhelming.
Taste - Again, complex without being overpowering. Initially tart, with a slight funk in the flavor. Lemony like the aroma. The tartness is immediately tamed by the chardonnay, which makes it one of the easiest-drinking sour ales I've ever had.
Mouthfeel - The chardonnay cuts any unpleasant harshness that may have arisen from the souring process. Light and bubbly. I could easily drink this too quickly, but I would be missing out.
Overall - Not intense like many other sours. A variety of subtle flavors that play nicely together. Something I definitely need more of. 993 charactersAlieniloquium, Feb 03, 2012
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375mL bottle of Russian River Temptation - batch number 6.
Appearance: this brew pours a vivid and unclouded blonde color with a pristine white head and no chill haze to be found.
Smell: if I were blindfolded while smelling this, I seriously might have guessed there was a glass of white wine under my nose.. the Chardonnay barrels are extremely pronounced.
Taste: the level of sourness that Temptation exhibited was a little higher than I was anticipating.. and it finishes much drier than Supplication. The back of the label reads "Is it beer, or is it wine?" "... Temptation is indeed beer." After taking my initial sips, this aforementioned question seems like a very reasonable one; the Chardonnay notes in this ale are uncanny. The funky brettanomyces characteristics (as well as lacto and pedio) are present, yet more restrained. There's a tad of French oakiness in the flavor as well.
Mouthfeel: pleasantly carbonated and medium bodied.. extremely dry.
Overall: of the three American wilds I've had from Russian River thus far, I'm putting Temptation in second place.. ahead of Consecration but behind Supplication. All of them are really unique and highly distinguishable.. this one being the most wine-like. 1,222 charactersBlastBeats, Feb 02, 2012

S - There is a strong white wine aroma with tart pears and grapes. Yeast aromas give the nose some funk. The aroma is definitely complex and I'm sure I could have spent more time discovering its intricacies. 
T - This is pretty damn sour. Very tart citrus, white grape, and apple. Bretty funk taste. On the far back end, there is a bit of a harsh bitterness, like lemon peel, that lasts for thirty seconds or so after I swallow and detracts from an otherwise wonderful sour beer.
M -Medium-bodied with just the right amount of dry, sour character. A little more sweetness than some sours, which I appreciated.

Appearance: As poured the beer is mostly clear with lots of active carbonation like a sparkling wine. The ½” white head covers a canary yellow liquid with a faint orange tinge to it. The head recedes very slowly leaving foam on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates nice leggy lacing, most of which clings to the side of the glass.
Smell: The aromas include the mild musty hay, along with barnyard and horse blanket, all of which show that the Bettanomyces has been at work here. In addition there is some oak with a bit of lemon and green apple in the background.
Taste: The flavors include some tart green apple with some mustiness that remains in the background. The tart acidity is tinged with some lemon zest and some of the green grape from the chardonnay. The contributions of the wine barrel aging are subtle and add layers of complexity with the oak and chardonnay. 
Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied and the carbonation is active and prickly. The finish is long and manages to be acidic, fruity and funky all at the same time but the final ending is a pleasant tartness that invites another sip.
Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a sipping beer to enjoy slowly. And it is easy to keep on sipping until the glass is empty. I’ll certainly be having this one again, both to re-evaluate what I think I’m smelling and tasting, and for the simple enjoyment of a complex, subtle well balanced beer that continues to reveal additional dimensions of flavor as it warms from its starting temperature. My overall impression is that this one is a winner folks.
Note: Since writing this review I had the opportunity to drink all 12 bottles of the 2012 bottling spread out over 18 mod, with one evening being able to do a side-by-side with a second bottle of the 2011 bottling. On the whole I think this beer is outstanding for the first 2 years of its bottle life but in the future will want to not let it age more than 2 years from bottling date. 2,095 charactersdrtth, Jan 24, 2012

A: Pours a beautiful yellow orange clear color.  Tons of carbonation bubbles coming off the bottom of the glass.  Half finger of bright white head.  Bottle conditioning adds those tight bubbles.  Such a clean beer.  (pronounced pop)

Straw-colored and pretty clear. Small head. Kind of bubbly.
Smell is mostly barnyard aromas, some light sour notes and some green apples. I love the funk on this.
Smooth flavors, really. Light acidity underpins flavors of funk, white wine, green apple. Finishes dry and vinegar-y sour.
Light mouthfeel. Not very carbonated. Goes down like water.
This is a great, if underwhelming, sour. It doesn't smack you in the face, and I'd peg the ABV way lower than it is. But it's still a complex and well-made beer. 521 charactersmusicforairports, Jan 19, 2012

S: Very light – barnyard and pleasant nipping sourness.
T: In many ways like a subtle champagne. It opens with a strong sour burst that immediately gives way to dryness. This is the most complex, layered and dynamic sour/dry interaction I've had. As far as tastes go, light sour grapes are present throughout and the finish is the beautiful lingering sour of Granny Smith apples.
M: Pleasant and well carbonated, not overly so, and just enough body to balance the sour and the dryness.

4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I don't normally like beer. But this beer is an exception. It was on tap at the beer shoppe. 
Appearance wise, it looks like piss. Like the yellow color when you don't drink enough water. Well, maybe you had 3 glasses of water total. 
Smell wise, I couldn't really put my finger on it. It smelled like the persian stew karafs which is basically celery stew. But seriously, the stew is yummy (make sure it's with beef). 
Taste wise, oh this is special. It tastes like a big mac. For reals. Like dipping a piece of onion in the big mac sauce. But also, like taking a big bite of the actual burger. close second if your local mc donalds is closed. 
As for mouthfeel, it was bubbly. That's all I have to say. 
Overall, delicious drink. Go for it. 747 charactersbeerdiety, Jan 16, 2012
3.85/5  rDev -12.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375 mL bottle, poured into a chalice. Batch #006.
Appearance: Pours a nice golden color with a bit of haze/particles. Minimal white head dissipates in seconds to a small film.
Smell: Very mild sour/tart aroma, with a hint of sugar.
Taste: Fairly crisp tart flavor, with some oranges. Mild tart/sour aftertaste with a hint of chardonnay.
Mouthfeel: Smooth with a pleasant moderate carbonation. Medium-bodied.
Drinkability: Moderate ABV for this style, good to drink.
I'm not a big fan of chardonnay, so I was a bit leery, but everything works well here. Not a whole lot going on in the flavor, but it is nice and fairly refreshing. 636 charactersmithrascruor, Jan 15, 2012

Beer is a light golden color with a fine skin of white foam.
Aroma is nondescript with just a slight tart note.
Flavor is all sourness. Tastes like white grape juice mixed with a small amount of white vinegar. Winced all the way through this one. Try as I may, I get nothing but that one note. No bitterness, no malt, no sweetness, no wood, just white grapes and sourness.
Unremarkable mouthfeel.
Dislike. 498 characterscharlzm, Jan 14, 2012

Pours with a big white head that dissipates quickly to a thin layer. The appearance reminds me of sparkling wine, however this is more opaque. The color is golden amber full of bubbles.
The nose is dominated by a variety of sour smells: sour fruit, sour barrel and tart fruit.
The sour taste is refreshingly mellow. There is just a hint of barrel in the flavor. I'm also detecting a little bit of white wine. All of this masks the alcohol very well.
The feel is light with some mild carbonation. It is very crisp and refreshing.
What I like about this brew is that it is a very approachable sour. The sour taste is not overwhelming, but completely hides the alcohol. This is an elegant example of its style. 749 charactersTotallyHosed, Jan 12, 2012
4.56/5  rDev +3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I tried a few sours before... and hated all of them (including RR's supplication). 
This one, on the other hand, is much more drinkable and pleasant to drink. In fact, I actually liked it! If it was a bit cheaper, I would drink this more often. 
Medium body, high carbonation, I love the bitterness at the beginning and dry finish like Saison... very tart throughout. 
This is the best I can describe it. Not much head though. Best sour I had so far. 453 characterssukwonee, Jan 11, 2012

S: Tart up front with some green apples, grape skins, lactic tartness, and some barnyard funk. The funk is a little heavier than some of the other wild ales that I've had lately, which I really like. 
T: The fruit comes out first, with some green apples and sour grapes.  The funkiness comes out just behind, with a good amount of hay and must.  The lactic tartness really comes out at the finish and lingers through each sip.

Batch 003 purchased on 3/16/2008, waxed, stored at 55 degrees for 1,370 days, and opened by me tonight. This is my last bottle of this vintage. Snifter. When I remove the wax and cage the cork shoots out with an emphatic pop, but the liquid does not rise or gush.
A: Bright dark gold with perfect clarity and an enormous white mousse-like head rising three fingers above the liquid exhibiting exceptional retention. The lacing forms a thick white coating on the sides of the glass as the head recedes. 
S: Ripe granny smith apple blends with wet leather and white grape. Oak is strong but not overpowering. Earth is apparent and I get light notes of barnyard and earth. The aroma displays a moderate tartness with evident lactic characteristics. There's a decided Chardonnay presence.
T: Chardonnay up front with ripe golden apples, a soft buttery note, and a piquant oak character. Lactic notes are pronounced, and there's a lower moderate tartness. Wet leather blends with earth and a mild spiciness. The finish is dry with evident tannins.
M: Light in body with high carbonation. The mouthfeel is bone dry and sticky.
Overall: One of the more successful aging experiences I've had. This is exceptional. 1,222 charactersHopHead84, Dec 17, 2011

3.81/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I was surprised to find out I've never reviewed this beer on here. This is batch 006, poured from a 375ml bottle into a Bruery tulip at around 45 degrees. Pours with surprisingly little head, much less than the previous batches I've tried. Maybe half a finger width after a quick pour. The head is bright white, dense, and sits atop a straw colored beer with some slightly light orange colors at the deeper points in the glass. Good lacing and retention for the style.
The smell is a rather huge helping of buttery, vanilla french oak, with a little bit of a white vinegar aroma in there too. To be honest it doesn't smell all that impressive, but it's passable. To be fair, I remember liking the smell on the other batches better.
A lot of the initial flavor I get is french oak as well, and I think it's mostly due to the aroma kinda forcing that onto my tongue when I smell as I imbibe. Some sour/funky notes take place mid-sip, and some lemon, tart green apple, pear, and apricot come out to play, but only briefly and mildly. Wraps up with a quick hit of white vinegar.
Mouthfeel is great, nice consistency, about medium I guess, and a soft carbonation that feels about right. A little bit oily on the tongue as well.
Overall I remember liking the last bottle I had considerably more, so I'm guessing this batch either needs more time in the bottle or is simply not as great as the others. With that said, this is still quite a good beer. 1,447 charactersBubba83, Dec 14, 2011

A: A big fluffy, frothy head of about 2 fingers. Great retention and nice glass lacing. 
S: There is a strong white wine aroma with tart pears and grapes. Yeast aromas give the nose some funk. The aroma is definitely complex and I'm sure I could have spent more time discovering its intricacies. 
T: Wow! As complex as the aroma, but clearly has hints of sour apple or pear and oaky white wine. The tannins give this some tartness and bite.
M: Light, well-carbonated, thirst-quenching and 7.25% ABV not so noticeable. 659 charactersKMcG, Dec 13, 2011

Appearance: Beautuful yellow gold with excellent clarity. Soft, white head with good retention. Nice sheets of lacing.
Smell: I got a whiff of sourness when I popped the cork and immediately started salivating. Sour lemon, lime, grape and apple. Musty brett funk. The underlying beer has some sweetish pale malt and a bit of soft yeast phenolics. Love it.
Taste: This is pretty damn sour. Very tart citrus, white grape, and apple. The underlying malt is almost completely smothered out until near the end. Bretty funk taste. On the far back end, there is a bit of a harsh bitterness, like lemon peel, that lasts for thirty seconds or so after I swallow and detracts from an otherwise wonderful sour beer.
Mouthfeel: High carbonation is slightly tingly and acccentuates the tartness. Lively. The flavor coats the mouth and puckers slightly.
Overall: Another great one from RR. Except for the bitterness on the finish, which is short lived, this is fantastic. 1,021 charactersrapidsequence, Dec 12, 2011

Appearance: Pours a clear light golden color, with minimal carbonation visible in the glass. Head is also minimal. In place of the head, there are wispy bubbles dancing about on the surface of the beer. Some wispy lace as well. Overall, the head and lacing are soapy in appearance.
Smell: First impression of the smell is a mint-like presence, with some lemon character mixed in. I want to say almost like Pine Sol, but in a good way. Quite sour and a bit mineral-like as well. There is also a hint of white wine grapes in the mix too.
Taste: Good balance between the sweet and the sour here. Not as face puckering as wilds can be. The sourness is a big part of the flavor, but doesn't linger too long and isn't uncomfortable. Sort of like a sweet tart. There are some of the white grapes that were in the nose as well. Ends with a bit of yeasty funk in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with just the right amount of dry, sour character. A little more sweetness than some sours, which I appreciated.
Overall: One of the better examples of the style I have had. Pretty easy to drink for a sour, and quite refreshing as well. Delicious! 1,249 charactersBuckyFresh, Dec 10, 2011

Smell: Fruity aroma consisting of citrus fruits, grapes, and tart cherries with some modest funk. 
Taste: The citrus fruit notes and grape aromas from the nose come through in the taste. Balanced equally between sourness and tartness. Finishes dry with a trace of oak from the barrel aging.
Mouth-feel: Light to medium body with lively carbonation.
Overall: I haven't tried Beatification, but either this or Consecration is my favorite Russian River wild ale and I've tried them all save Beatification. I've been impressed by them all but this one hits the mark for me in every way. Tasty and complex with a satisfying feel, what more can I ask for. 720 charactersIKR, Dec 10, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Green Dragon Brewpub. Poured into a large snifter. 
A - Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Tons of lacing stick to the sides of the glass. A solid stream of bubbly carbonation can be seen shooting up the center of the glass.
S - As I expected, the first smell that hits my nose is the funky Brett. Combines with the tartness from the sour grapes/lemons and the aromas of white wine and oak from the barrel aging. Creates the aroma I expect from a Russian River sour.
T - Brett funk and oak pop out to me first. Some white wine nuances follow. It's wrapped up with apples, grapes and lemon to create a nice fruity tartness that combines well with the funky sour flavor from the yeast. 
M - Light bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Crisp, effervescent and smooth with a dry finish. Very easy to drink. I found it quite refreshing. 
O - Another great sour from RR. Everything really works in unison to create a refreshing sour ale that I would love to enjoy again. 1,000 charactersMahlik, Nov 29, 2011

S: Tart and funky with a hint of buttery oak and soft fruits, specifically pear. 
T: Tart and funky, but not overpowering. Leaves plenty of room for notes of pear and apple to shine through, and a hint of oak. Finishes with notes of clove and some herbal/grassy hop notes.
M: If anything, this is where this beer lacks just slightly. Not quite as much body as I had hoped, but given the wild yeast it's a difficult mission to achieve. 
O: Pricey, but worth every penny. An extremely enjoyable beer. 656 charactersaggiearcher13, Nov 20, 2011

Color is a pale, slightly hazy amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is very good with sour and yeast on top, followed by oak, malt, wine and citrus. Flavor is not quite as complex with the brightness of the oaked sour malt with citrus; wine is in the background. Body and carbonation are exactly what they're supposed to be. Finish is like flavor, clean, balanced and refreshing. Nice picnic brew or for cooking. 535 charactersdrpimento, Nov 18, 2011

A- Before I poured the entire bottle into the glass it was crystal clear golden pour. The finger width snow white head lasted momentarily before it settled to a thin white cap. Lacing is quite sticky.
S- The oak and chardonnay are very upfront, not overpowering but there and refined. Definite brett funk with the wet hay/blanket smells. There is a refreshing grape/lemon tart smell that goes hand in hand with the grass notes. The sweetness is more vanilla than anything and really ties everything together.
T- Right up front is the brett funk and oak, followed by the wine characteristics with tart grape and lemon notes. Tart cherries and cranberries before it goes full circle and we are back to the brett to give a dry funk before your mouth waters for more.
M- Thin to medium bodied with a wonderful carbonation. It just feels right. My mouth waters and it feels perfect.
O- With this being my third rr "ion" beer I knew I was going to be in for a real treat, but holy cow this thing is magical. if only Cali wasn't 4500km away 1,056 characterskorguy123, Nov 17, 2011

5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is one of three (Brugge Bad Kitty and BFM Bon-Chien) that set the standard for me when it comes to what I want in a sour, so i figured I should review it. I've been fortunate to have this beer about 6-7 times and am sent into a euphoric state everytime. I'm hardly alone here considering its score and the fact that everyone I share this holy liquid with bows down as well.
A: Pale lemony yellow color like that of Chardonnay (imagine that!). Minimal head.
S: I want to implant this beautifully bretty, fruity, oaky aroma in my nose. If everything in the world smelled like this everything in the world would be better for it.
T: Tart and fruity and just a tiny dollop of vanilla and spice. Balance is a beautiful thing. Fresh crisp apples with a touch of lemon citrus.
M: It cleans up so well. Tart with a dry effervescence. At this point you will likely be chugging straight from the bottle like a heathen. Lapping up every drip of this wonderful elixir.
O: I like this beer, a lot. 
I have two bottles left... will they make it through the night? 1,065 charactersmystikyle71, Nov 16, 2011

Pours a clear and light golden blonde with almost no head, seeing this beer set in front of me didn't excite me very much, that did change when I had a wiff of it though. The smell is rich of grapes, tartness and a funkiness almost wine like. The taste follows suite with sour grapes, tartness, champagne, natural earth funk, almost like a riesling. Lighter bodied with a dry finish, very champagne like. This is really a good beer. 508 charactersBdubleEdubleRUN, Nov 15, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle slowly into a tulip glass. Batch 006 listed.
A good solid pop on the cork, giving a small foamy off white one finger head that falls slowly. Very nice slightly cloudy lemon hued and light orange body, with some very slow rising carbonation. Looks nice.
Nose is a good brett, some oak buttery sense, and mild apple fruit. Quite nice.
Taste is incredibly refreshing. Slight chewy malt density, but then a crisp mild tart apple. Wine like viscosity and pleasing crisp carbonation. Finish has a slight drying sense, and a feeling of crisp bubblly. Very fruity, some mild hints of tropical such as pineapple, even some mild light baguette white bread.
Real nice brew, rather enjoyed this more than I expected. Also surprisingly very easy drinking for the style and full of flavor. Another nice job from Russian River. 839 characterssmakawhat, Nov 10, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A corked and caged 375 mL bottle from leschkie; thank you! Split into four snifters to share with friends; review from notes taken 09/30/2011.
Body is a translucent yellow, though an ever present stream of bubbles obscures some light. About a centimeter of bubbly white head forms. The aroma is of tart fruits (peach, apple, pear, grape), slight funk, and some crisp, floral scents. It tastes of grape, tart apple, peach, and pear, various other fruits, straw, grain, faint yeast, a hint of oak, and white wine. Mouthfeel is crisp, smooth, clean, and finishes a touch dry. Overall, a great sour that is easy drinking; I could happily have one daily. 650 characterseclipse54, Nov 07, 2011

The beer is a bright yellow with a hint of yeast haze and a very patchy ring of white foam. The beer smells very good, very much like 3F gueuze, with a hint of crush granny smith apples, juiced lemons, and a layer of musty funk. The beer tastes very similar to the aroma, with a nice tangy lemon upfront, a bitter tannic oak in the middle that is almost minty and numbing, the finish is juicy like apple rind. The alcohol is really well hidden and though the slightly lower than expected carbonation knocks it down a notch. Overall this is very good, almost as good a 3F Oude Gueuze, but not quite. It's nice the RR or any American brewer/blender can make a beer this good. I wonder if more time in the barrel would drastically improve this beer since it is conditioned with brett and bugs. 811 charactersSoonami, Nov 03, 2011

i've had this on tap at RR, but the first time i had this was at monk's RR Stuff-if-ication beer dinner 7 June 2011. 
i was more excited for this course than any mainly because i was so eager to try Temptation after severely enjoying consecration and supplication in the past. 
the course was a lobster stuffed ravioli with a quail egg, corn puree, and RR Temptation butter.
 it was a hit. it was excellent. and we recieved 2 flute pours each of Temptation. magical.
notes from that evening...
Light-gold and very carbonated. nearly yellow actually. not much head at all--i didn't have one. poured like wine, sat like wine, swirled like wine, felt like beer.
the wine characteristics are incredible actually. pungent grape aromas. brett funk: bready, mild cheese stink, dirt and grass. baking apples and butterscotch. chardonnay aromas abound.
aaaahhh. amazing. sour apple, like a sweet tart and a jolly rancher at the same time. i don't really like white wine, especially chardonnay, but the brett funk and barrel sugars level it all out. it's sour, really tart, but it's not cutting and it doesn't burn, which is really impressive for a beer made this way.
there's a good deal of carbonation which gives this an incredible edge in a food pairing. the dish is very rich, which is a perfect combination with the sharp, bubbly Temp to clean up.
heart. this is love. this is absolutely lovely. i bet you could get any devout wine drinker to really enjoy this and any skeptic to open up a bit more. this is extremely ideal for cheese, fish, pastry, you name it. 
i enjoy this beer, because it tastes good. i love this beer, because it represents the philosophy of "craft": unique, concentrated, beloved, and deliberately constructed based on the talent, ingenuity, and environment from which it was concieved.
cheers. 1,914 characterspatm1986, Oct 31, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Temptation, Batch 006: Poured From bottle into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Golden in color, little to no haziness, this, of course, is different than supplication and consecration.
Aroma: Great oak barrel. The distinct aroma or Bret as well as the other three bugs used comes through quite nicely, would have liked to pick up more of the grape aroma. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and highly carbonated.
Taste: Puckering sour but not overwhelming, 
closer to a supplication but not as developed. The chardonnay wine is not readily detectable in this beer. I plan to drink my other bottle in three years. 
Overall: Another masterpiece from Russian River this one is not as complex as the Giant Consecration and Supplication but its still a great great sour! 756 charactersChanChan, Oct 26, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the RR brewpub. Pours a light blond color with a little bit of head. The aroma definitely has the funkiness of the sour notes, along with some light fruits like apples and pears, almost white wine-like. The taste is nice and tart without too much puckering, and again some more pear, apples, grapes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation, and comes across smooth, yet finishes dry.
This is a great beer for all sour fans: those you want to introduce to sours, and those that are already fans. It's that good. 548 charactersmkotsayfan, Oct 24, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Grabbed a couple bottles today locally to send as a part of a trade. I've had this beer multiple times, but I thought i'd sample the latest batch a bit fresh. 
Batch 006 3 hour glasses of potential into lost abbey tulip.
A: Pear juice in a glass with white wine thin nanofiber foams forming a ring around the edges of the glass. Some foams hover over the center of the beer like milkfat, but it's more or less just a pseudo head formation. The white wine-like qualities of this beer are undeniable. This could win a look alike contest.
S: The smell is really exciting, just a slight tang of barnyard funkiness that plays on potent lemongrass. There's a young vibrancy to the nose that is really very notable, in other words it doesn't seem so aged. It's almost like the first born appearance of that bretty character you get in so many super funky lambics. It's a beautiful thing, like an embryo of age.
T: Taste totally rocked my world. I've had this beer many times, but this is absolutely near perfection. No acetic vinegar burn whatsoever. The tang is lemony and bright like my first sip of DDG. Really I am taken back by how cloudy, soft, foamy, fluffly, and generally creamy the beer is in its current state. Makes me wonder about a great many sour beers I have aging. This really is a head check. Tad bit of whip butter on a funky lemon zest. Some horseradish faint bitterness that makes me want a sammich pronto. 
M: This is a baby blanket in the mouth, I am taken back to an infantile state as the tart prickling sensation of the beer takes me to a bed of satin. I am petrified by a lullaby of perfection. The taste and the mouth are just so on. I'm lost in a dream like state of mouth feels. I recite poetry in my mind while being unable to speak.
O: This could be a batch thing, but seriously I am floored by this beer. This is perhaps my 2nd time out of a bottle, while I've had this at the source more than once. The lemony fine dining funk that I currently get in this beer is as refined as it comes. I'd be more than happy to grab a case of batch 6 and see how it goes, but at the same time I'd be tempted to drink this as is every night that passes. Simply an absolutely fantastic drinking beer. This is worth every penny, I want a 750 or two to compliment some future cases of 375s. Give batch 6 a try and see if you don't feel the same. It's young, but I'll be damned if it's not drinking on that heavenly level already. 2,444 charactersCavery, Oct 23, 2011

S lots of barnyard funk from the brett along with some sour grapes and a hint of what might be apples. 
T a nice tart funk with some wood from the oak barrels. More grapes and some apple maybe.
M reminiscent of champagne with a light bubbly feel.
Overall a top notch sour that shows Russian River knows how to make a world class sour. 431 charactersbeerandcycling88, Oct 23, 2011

Pours a bright golden straw, an inch fluffy white head that lasts.
Tart citrus and a farmhouse funk dominate the nose. 
Crisp and tart with white grapes, lemons. Tart, but not overly puckering.
Tight carbonation, fluffy, dry and crisp. The mouth really compliments the beer quite well.
Another beautifully crafted sour from Russian River. Incredibly drinkable, especially for someone who's just getting into the style. A gateway sour that can still hold its own with enthusiasts. 511 charactersdbmernin83, Oct 19, 2011

Tastes of mildly sour fruit and Bretty yeast, but little else. Much more bland than its RR peers and quite disappointing overall. Makes me appreciate Consecration even more. 317 charactersbrystmar, Oct 16, 2011

S - Brett, some clove, banana, oak.
T - Initial taste of musty oak, sour funk. Mildly acidic fruitiness comes through with a mildly dry finish.
M - Light and carbonated.
O - Mildly sour ale with lots of complexity. Very drinkable and a good intro into sours. 381 characterspigc, Oct 15, 2011

Pours a nice light amber with a small white head. Nose is tart, funky and crisp, very approchable.
Taste is almost perfect, it's tart and tasty without being too acidic or sour. There's a nice bretty taste that drys out your mouth and makes you want more. Very, very solid beer and still awesome on draft! 362 characterskingcrowing, Oct 12, 2011

S: Nice and tart, but not overly sour. A little bit of light cherry, grass, oak, faint apple, and a slight mustiness. 
T: Nice sourness level. Flavors of lemon, light oak, and a bit of chardonnay. I am surprised at how nicely the wine flavor comes through. There is a slight grassy component and some light fruit. 
M: Light to medium bodied with lively carbonation and a great level of sourness. 
O: Very easy drinking. Not overly sour and very approachable. A great beer to sip over a long evening. 668 charactersmdaschaf, Oct 11, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From notes, poured into a tulip.
Really enjoyed this beer. It’s nice and crisp, a bit lighter but still complex and intriguing. Obviously dominated by fruit flavors, but the grains do come through with a nice subtle oaky flavor that really enhances the fruitiness. It’s amply sour but doesn’t have as strong a bite as the other Russian River sours which is actually really nice with its lighter complexion and softer flavors. 
Verdict: Really great, worth every penny. Highly recommended. 496 characterskevanb, Oct 06, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I finally decided to open one of these. This bottle is from Batch 05X2F.
It pours a light bodied bright orange gold in color with little to no carbonation. It smells lactic, acidic, has definite California Chardonnay characteristics, and even a little butter. Oh wow, having had a lot of chardonnay lately this one is right up my alley. It really does smell like a tart chardonnay. It's very impressive. The flavors too are very acidic, lactic, and very heavy on vinous and slightly buttery California chardonnay. This beer puts "Russian River" in perspective, being in prime wine country this emulates the local wines and is really quite transcendiary. It is impressive through and through. This is my new favorite from Russian River and a phenomenal, world class beer. It has truly earned its reputation. 807 charactersaasher, Oct 04, 2011

Poured a golden honey with a finger of fizzy white head. Reduced quickly into a thin film.
Smells of white grapes (the Chardonnay barrels shining through) granny smith apples, lemons, and some funk.
Tastes like day old Chardonnay but with some fresh carbonation... But in a good way. Crisp granny smith and lemons make up the rest.
Light and crisp mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Drying wine like aftertaste.
Overall, this was a refreshing sour. Not too sour but just enough twang on each sip. Big thanks to SolomonGrundy for this bottle 578 charactersdcloeren, Oct 02, 2011

A -some lemon and a little orange peel influence, definite wine presence some funk is here, Brett is here
T - I could crush this all summer...perfect Brett influence, I'm not a big white wine fan but this is done well the oak dryness battles some of the sweetness little lemon tart in the back...Im a huge fan of Brett. 
M - very easy to drink, a really tight carbonation that is well done fizzy feel in a good way, good body 
O - love it, my first "tion" was redemption and it was absolute shit IMO this one is great I need to try the others now, deftly want more, Thanks to the man D. 694 charactersJayAre46, Oct 02, 2011
3.97/5  rDev -10%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375 mL bottle from a trade with PinkFlag, thanks Brandon !
Appearance is a golden yellow tone which is nearly clear with a thin white head. The nose has apple, lemon peel, chardonnay, oak and funk. Its` taste is fairly similar to the nose , along with some grapes and more of the funk/brett. As others have noted, it has many characteristics similar to a sparkling wine. The mouthfeel does not have too much sour or too much of any characteristic really. It is nice and crisp, a very good wild ale that I had waited too long to try. 533 charactersmltobin, Sep 28, 2011
3.66/5  rDev -17%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5375ml corked and caged bottle. Batch 05X1E.
It pours a brilliant yellowish orange with a nice foamy white head that leaves some nice lacing.
The smell is bretty and fruity. It isn't that potent of a smell though. I am getting a faint bit of pineapple and a faint sourness. There is also a bit of malt. Odd that I can't really smell this one, might just be me.
The flavor is nice though. It is not really sour but bretty. the brett shines in this brew, if you like it then you will like this brew. A bit of funk and lemon paired with a nice malt and a hit of oak and wine bill complete this brew.
A very nice one from Russian River. 635 characterscrossovert, Sep 17, 2011

A: Golden straw color, with a lot of haze. One finger bright white, very thick head. Awesome retention and lacing.
S: Something upfront that I can't place. I will guess it's Chardonnay since I've never smelled it before. It's a tad buttery and bready. A medium funkiness and tartness. Oak comes through a little. A touch of apples.
T: Tart and citrusy. Light funkiness. Green apple along with some other fruits I can't place. It all kinda fades into what I would guess is the wine. Has a slight bitterness in the finish along with some oak notes.
M: Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Slight creaminess. Very smooth. Super dry finish.
O: I think this is the best of the Russian River Sours. I have yet to review Consecration, but have had it. The sour/tartness doesn't overpower but is totally perfect. Definitely a must try for entry into sours. 887 charactersdoughanson78, Sep 17, 2011

A- Hazy golden color with three fingers of dense white foam. Head recedes leaving a thin white coaster and a nice ring around the outside of the glass. 
S- The nose is Chardonnay, tart grapes, and a bit of funk. 
T- White wine, tart grapes and barnyard funk are softened mid-palate by oak and a very nice malt profile. Sourness kicks back in at the finish and the aftertaste is a lingering combination of tart funk. 
M- Feel is light and refreshing with a high level of carbonation. ABV is undetectable in the melange of wonderful flavors present in the beer. 
O- Another great beer from Russian River. I really like the oak and white wine characteristics combined with the tart funkiness of the brett. Recommended! 761 charactersSideswipe, Sep 12, 2011

A: The beer poured a light golden color with a thick head of fluffy white foam. Numerous strands of bubbles are continuously racing to the top and there is strong lacing clinging to the sides of the glass.
S: Very tart and pungent aroma of fruit, vinegar and oak, similar to a white wine or champagne. 
T: There is a wonderful initial tartness to this beer with sweet fruitiness reminiscent of a Gewurztraminer, Chardonnay or champagne. The oak is present but not overpowering. I get a touch of vinegar but it's extremely minimal.
M: The beer has a soft body, but there is a subtle heaviness to it, so I'd have to say light to medium overall. Extremely fizzy with fantastic carbonation. Very dry mouth feel.
O: This is an outstanding sour. It really reminds me of a champagne, and I'm sure you'd be able to convince people of this if you didn't tell them what it was. 927 charactersdistantmantra, Sep 10, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Review #500!
Bottle traded to me by bobertkuekn. Outside of Beatification this was the last Russian River sour that I was really excited to get my hands on. Luckily I got two 375's, one for tonight, and one for a later date.
This is batch 05X1F, bottled on 7/06/2010. Just over a year of age on her.
Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip. Temptation is a bright golden honey color that has some of the best clarity and lacing I have ever seen on an American Wild. The head is white and sticky, with a nice short cap of foam that lasted the entire glass. Just stunning.
Smelled immediately of white wine, the minute the cork popped. On closer inspection buttery chardonnay and sweet golden grapes spring forth. Funky oak and juicy brett waft up at me, even at a distance. I am finding that I really enjoy sours aged in white wine barrels. This is the best Russian River beer I have had to date.
The taste explodes with all of the attractive qualities of a fine white wine. The beer is nice and sour, but not anything overpowering or enamel peeling. Oak and dusty attic funk round out the beer. The lasting finish is of a more mineral quality.
Dry with a nice oaky presence. Light body with moderate carbonation.
Overall an exceedingly excellent beer. Far better than I could have wished it to be. Now my appetite is truly wet for a taste of Beatification. The hunt is on! 1,370 charactersSpider889, Sep 08, 2011

A: It pours a light straw color, almost the color of a light pilsner. In the glass it is a slightly dusty pear or grapefruit color. The head looks very dense, but soft, and is white. 
S: Tart, with a lot of acidic smells, the vinegar is really present in this. Some oak notes, and just a hint of a light fruitiness that reminds me of champaign. As I continue to smell it, there almost seems to be a hint of vanilla. 
T: Very tart at first, with some light citrus flavors. A little bit of vinegar, but not the bomb I was expecting. Some light wine notes as well as a touch of oak. This is a gentle flavor, and not overpowering. There is a little something odd that clings in the finish, but overall I really enjoy it. 
M: Medium to medium light in body, with a certain softness to it. Plenty of carbonation, with a decent tingle. 
O: Overall I really like it, enough sour that you can get your kick, but not so overpowering that it wrecks your palate for the rest of the night. 993 charactersBeejay, Sep 08, 2011

Taste. Tart, green apple, pear and peaches. White wine and oak present, but less than the smell. Nice light funk and yeast. Very tart without vinegar qualitites. Alcohol well hidden.

12oz corked and caged. Opens with a resounding pop, and pours a bright gold sporting a fierce, crackling white head. The aroma is full of brett, funk, and alittle grapey. Strong sour notes, almost mimicking lemon rind, but more bitter and sour than that. Musty, funky, and oaky tannins are present with some wood notes, mildly astringent but sour the whole way through. Mouthfeel is light bodied, very dry, yet quenching as well. Overall, this is a serious beer, for serious beer crusaders. Fantastic. 529 charactersStinkypuss, Aug 24, 2011

a: Honestly I could have given this a 5, I didn't cause well I hope I never find a perfect beer... But the appearance is quite crystal clear. Golden to very light orange in color with noticeable carbonation throughout the drinking process. Head stuck around as well. I could look at this beer all day.
s: Along with looking at it, I spent 10 minutes just smelling the beer before I even took a drink. The smell of oak, grapes and chardonnay hit you at 1st, then the brett takes over which leaves you to smell again. Aroma is very complex.
t: Taste is just as complex as the aroma. Wine grapes, oak, earthy funkiness, melons, citrus some apple. The tartness of the beer hits you up front but then quickly give way to the complexity
m: Very carbonated, which is a good thing. Prickly on the tongue. Very dry finish which I love in a good beer.
o: I have to say that before I had this that Supplication was my favorite RR beer. That has been beaten by this. One if not the best beers I have ever drank, and wish I had access to all the time. I kind of hate myself for drinking it.... 1,286 charactersnhudson, Aug 24, 2011

A vigorous pour left a big pillowy white head that sat hissing atop a clear golden-straw colored body. Head didn't stick around long, and left small blotches of lace along the sides of the glass. Nose was white grape, oak, grass, apple and an overall light sour funkiness. Taste brought out a lemon component that I didn't get in the nose. The white wine presence was more noticeable in the taste than the smell. The tartness was relatively light in the taste, but pleasantly refreshing. Finish had a slight bitterness to it. Mouthfeel was light with a high amount of carbonation and a dry finish. Overall a tasty and refreshing beer. 666 characterssurlytheduff, Aug 12, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 375ml into a White Birch flute glass, thanks to jwjon1 for sending me this one
Appearance: Light yellow with small bubbles streaming to the top with a fluffy white head about two fingers thick that fades into a thin lacing over the top of the beer. 
Aroma: A hint or lemon zest, tart apples and barnyard funk with a subtle fruitiness. Very complex and very enjoyable to just there and smell. 
Taste: Sour and tart up front but incredibly complex. A touch of oak on the finish with, citrus, sour apples, and white grapes interwoven in the taste upfront.
Mouthfeel: Champagne like effervesce with a dry lingering sour finish. 
Overall: So far this is the best sour/ wild ale I have had to date. Incredibly complex and very well blended. This is easily a beer I could drink all the time. 803 charactersjamescain, Aug 08, 2011

much like the sanctification this one is straw yellow and with a thin bubbly head. the nose is sweet tart, apple, pear, but more green grape than sanctification. much better in the flavor as well. quite tasty...apple, pear, and green grape. mouth is nice, but nothing crazy. this was a great sour. i'm not a huge fan of sours, but this was one that i was very impressed with. 488 characterscosmicevan, Aug 08, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Signature Russian River corked and caged 375 ml bottle pulled from the cellar. Batch 05X1F, I've been sitting on this one for just a few months and decided I was in the mood for something sour. Served at cellar temperature, around 55ºF, poured into a tulip glass.
A: Golden orange semi-hazy body, topped with a pure white fluffy and sudsy head. The dissipation is rather rapid although a retention cap sticks around for the entire consumption. Some minor lacing is present, a bit less than I like to see but still quite a gorgeous beer to look at.
S: Dandelions, rose hips, floral "spice," peach, lemon zest, oak and white grapes. All come through on their own but blend to give a very light, crisp and tart fragrance. Towards the end of the nose, a hint of white grapefruit comes forward with its acidic character.
T: At first, the tart and puckering nature of this beer is obvious. Sweet and tart white grapes coat the palate, along with lemon and honey. A slight oak note is in the finish but there's really no lingering taste other than a bit of a dry bite. The woodiness I thought might be overpowering but it is well displayed and evidence the use of the French Oak Chardonnay barrels for it's secondary aging is masterfully done.
M: On the lower end of a medium-bodied beer, sparkling and bubbly like a champagne. The finish is semi-dry across the palate and slightly prickly.
Well, of all the "standard" Russian River Wild Ales I've sampled, this one might just be my favorite. I feel it's extremely balanced in both aromas and flavors, while providing enough depth, complexity and balance to be a showpiece for a Wild Ale. The aging on French Oak Chardonnay barrels was the touch that took this beer above and beyond my expectations for the style. 1,762 charactersShanePB, Aug 01, 2011

A- Pours a crystal clear golden color with a thin white head that leaves some lace.
S- Bright lemon sour nose with some wine and Brett funk. Ripe citrus fruit with a hint of oak.
T- Tart right off the bat with plenty of must and sourness. The Chardonnay Barrels work wonders with this flavor profile. Some light oak and vanilla flavors are noticeable in the finish with just a tough of alcohol. Tart apples and pepper add some depth.
M- Medium bodied with good carbonation. Fairly dry and mouth puckering!
O- This is one fantastic sour. Huge flavor without any individual component being too overpowering. 628 charactersprojectflam86, Jul 31, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A-Cloudy yellow, two finger head, carbonated and some lacing.
S-Wheat, yeast and grapes
T-Tart, not quite mouth puckering sour but what it lacks in extreme sour it makes up for balance. Lemony and grassy. Some oak. A Sharper not as long lasting sour.
M-Light and carbonated, unlike the other RR sours I've had so far.
O-So far the best. Not the most sour but it is the most balanced of the bunch. The lemon like flavors make this a great brew. 447 charactersrlee1390, Jul 31, 2011

A - pours a straw yellow without much of a head
S - soft white grapes, tart fruits, and a Brett blanket thrown on top
T - tart green fruits (apples, pears, pineapples (not green)) make a grand entrance and set the tone for the rest of the brew. A nice vinous flavor is up next, as to be expected from the chardonnay barrel aging. Somewhere in here is a nice sweat-like funkiness added by the Brett. Ends with a semi-acidic rind tartness and more vinous flavors intertwined with some subtle oak character. More sour than I was expecting and has a really nice depth to it as well. Really good stuff!
M - a champagne-like mouthfeel with spritzy bubbles and a nice foamy, yet slick (almost buttery), body. 
D - this is the best 'tion' RR beer I have had to date. Really enjoyable all the way around. Good thing I have one more bottle, but I feel like that still isn't sufficient enough. Highly recommended. 971 charactersbirchstick, Jul 31, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Pours a golden-yellow with a thin white head and tiny bubbles floating through. No lacing to speak of.
S: Aroma incredibly sour (you pucker just smelling it) with white grapes and a little bit of funk to it. Perfect wild ale smell if you ask me. I can't wait to drink it. 
T: After the intensely sour smell, the taste is a bit of a let-down - it's not nearly as sour as I expected. Still somewhat sour, but I'm getting a lot more oak and white wine notes from it. It's quite light and easy to drink, definitely not as big of a flavor as the other two regular RR sours. 
M: Very light with a dry finish. It's also rather carbonated in a champagney sort of way.
O: My personal opinion - this is the weakest of the 3 regular Russian River sours, but it's still one of the best year-round wild ales out there. It's just not as complex as its brothers. Perhaps it's just because I'm more of red wine than white wine drinker, but I just don't find this one as interesting. It's a tasty, easy to drink, refreshing wild however. 1,027 charactersstarrdogg, Jul 23, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 05X2E poured into a snifter.
Pours a pale golden color, carbonation is seen rising from the bottom of the glass.  Half finger white head quickly settles to only a thin film.  Nice lacing.
Immediately I'm hit with sour Brett.  This is followed by a winey note, light citrus, and soured fruit such as cherries and a touch of strawberries.
Taste is initially light.  Sourness is gueze-like, not any particular fruit.  Well, maybe cherries... Im having trouble picking something.  Barrel aging is evident with woodey, oakey notes.  Chardonnay does come through, a nice touch.  Finishes lightly sour, moderately funky, and dry.
Mouthfeel is full-bodied, yet light and easy drinking.  Carbonation is just right.
Overall, this was a solid barrel aged sour ale.  Also, not mouth puckeringly sour.  Nothing bad can come from RR. 841 charactersAdrianized, Jul 22, 2011
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- The cork lets loose with a convincing *POP*, and the beer pours a very evidently bubbly gold ale. A pleasantly filmy 1/2 finger head lingers atop the bright and lively body. 
S- You can smell this one from a foot away, cheek puckering tartness of a lemony persuasion met with some dank wet wood. This is definitely an acquired taste, as the nose is almost unpleasing if taken out of context. If you're a fan of the style, however, it's divine. 
T- Soft citrus and a bit of hop roll across the palate before the tartness crescendos into full on sour. Oak flavors give some great texture to the finished product, smoothing out the rough edges of such a bold yeast strain. The chardonnay comes through a bit less than I had expected, probably because it gets overwhelmed by the acidity of the sour. There's hardly any detectable alcohol.
M- Dry and tart, this is a very refreshing beer. It's quite bubbly, of course, and it wouldn't have worked were it any thicker. The sour kick never gets old, and doesn't wear on the palate much. The aftertaste rolls through lightly with a nice blend of mild hop bitterness and resonant acidity.
O- Though American wild ales aren't my sour of choice, the four that I've had from Russian River's series have been greatly enjoyable and a refreshing change of pace. 1,303 charactersgigaknight, Jul 22, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a stemless crystal Chardonnay glass. Thanks Chickencoop!
Pours a brilliant gold into the glass, a light head rings the outside of the glass. Small bubbles float on a lake of beautiful pale yellow.
The smell wafts up, hitting me in the face. A puckering sour full of bright fruits, white grapes, muscadines, and a light barn-like flavor.
Taste is reserved and elegant. This beer knows what it's doing. The wine-like brightness and light sour blend in an amazing combination. A metallic bite on the end that has an earthiness to it, this beer is a gentle giant, a soft-spoken hulking behemoth. 
Clearly this beer is over my head. I'm not sure I can pick out all the flavors, and I'm not entirely certain I ever could, no matter how much I had. I said a prayer silently thanking God and Vinnie for this thing of beauty. It's unfortunate, not sure other sours will ever be able to measure up. 902 charactersNashvillain, Jul 22, 2011

Delicious wild ale taste, tart, yeast, and bready, a subtle oak barrel woodiness, a soft spicy hoppiness, the alcohol is well masked, but warming in the palate, and a dry. Palate is medium to thin which makes this very drinkable. The sourness is present in the taste, but is not overpowering. RR knows what it's doing. 507 charactersbeergod1, Jul 18, 2011
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Just bought my first four RR sours and this is the first I am reviewing
Appearance: Nearly looks like liquid gold. A very shiny yellow. Completely clear. Not much head at all
Smell: Sour funkiness with grape/wine notes and a very saison like horse blanket smell. Smell is very strong, noticeable as soon as you pop open the cork. Wish it had a little more complexity as the sourness is a little too strong.
Taste: Wow can you tell that this was aged in chardonnay barrels. Very winey feel. Very sour funkiness with some oak character as well but very mellow. Apple and pear like fruits showing up the most
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation but I found something rather wierd about the mouthfeel. At lower temperatures it seemed fluffy. Not chewy as you find in a lot of good beers, but fluffy. Nearly chewy but not completely there or something like that.
As my first RR I must say it's a solid beer, great beer, but I don't know if it matches the hype. Would always be glad to be drinking this beer anytime of the day anytime of the year but wouldn't HAVE to be drinking it unlike some of my more favorites. Wow it sounded like im shitting on this beer. ITS GOOD just not amazing. ok im done ranting. 
Definitely recommend not having this beer too cold. Definitely better imo at lower temps. 1,294 charactersalf212, Jul 14, 2011

T: Fruity, tart, refreshing, a good outdoorsy summer beer for fans of sours or someone who wants to expand their palate. 
M: Well carbonated but not overly done so. The carbonation doesn't dissipate right away. Very pleasent.
O: This is my go-to sour for warm summer nights. Overall a wonderfully constructed RR sour but not my favorite. The lightest of the bottled RR sours. 527 charactersGoldstar81, Jul 13, 2011

A: Poured a deep golden color, most comparable to tree sap. Very little head, but permanent lacing
S: Definitely sourness straightforward. When you smell it, it has that piercing sourness that hits you in the jowls, also kinda dusty if that makes sense
T: A very citrusy type of sourness, almost like a lemon balm, also has deep earthy characteristics
F: Very tingly and smooth. Very good carbonation, and again, hits you in the jowls on the finish
Overall, I really like this one. Can't say I've ever had a bad RR beer though. If you like wild ales and sours, this is the top one I would recommend. It was a very,, very complex beer though, so I will be revisiting it soon. Cheers, Russian River 729 charactersBobheed, Jul 09, 2011

The head was foamy and white leaving a bit of lacing. The smell of the beer smells a lot like Chardonnay with a bit of wild yeast coming through in the back end. The taste of the beer is actually pretty good. I was surprised that it really didn't give off much of a pucker factor after each sip. The flavors of white wine, tart grapes and some wheat are what I'm picking up here. The mouthfeel was pretty good, almost refreshing. Overall I was very impressed by this beer. The flavors and the other elements that it brings to the table were really good. I wasn't sure how much I was going to enjoy this one but it turned out to be a success. 748 charactersKnapp85, Jul 05, 2011

Served in GI silver goose white-wine glass. 
A: Pours clear straw with sparkling effervescence. The head lacks size, but makes up in retention. Great lacing. 
S: Brettanomyces makes its presence known immediately with barnyard and musty basement aromas. A little cheese rind, too. Some lactic acid and musty hay tickles the nose, as well. A bit of lemon zest and barrel?
T: Lactic acid sucker-punches palate. Then lemon zest, citric acid and musty hay come in. Less barnyard than expected, but it is still present, and gains strength in finish, which is crisp and dry. Medium acid. 
M: Medium body and carbonation, but relatively soft mouthfeel. 
O: Temptation drinks like an American Gueuze, if that makes sense. Nice balance of various wild yeasts and bacteria. Very good drinkability.

I poured this into my trusty DuClaw Colossus snifter.
A: I'll say that this is a burnt clear yellow color, with a mild 1/100 finger head that didn't want to give up... no matter how much I yelled at it.
S: Woody sourness for sure. Fruity notes and with a nice oaky disposition. Nothing too complex so far.
T: Subtle French oak. Sour, and with a big boost from my pal "Brett." Complex, with Granny Smith apple notes. However, I feel there is any sour readily accessible to the common RR drinker, this is the one!
M: Mild prickle from the carbonation, and very subdued in its sourness. This may have been due to the oak aging.
O: Great stuff, but definitely not my favorite sour by a long shot.

A - Pours a perfect slightly pale golden color with some nice bright yellow hints. It is quite hazy but there is some translucence to it. There is a nice thin 0.5 inch head that is dense but recedes quickly to a nice thin film.
S - Nice fresh white grapes, buttery white wine with some nice mild tartness on teh back end of the nose. Nice funk with some nice woody oak notes that are very fresh. Quite delicious nose for this beer. There is some slight pear notes as well as apple and some good malty grain notes.
T & M - Wow! This beer is delicious. Dry woody notes, fresh yet funky yeast notes. There is some nice white grape juice and some nice pear and apple. Buttery white wine is tasted. The Chardonnay really pops in the taste but its quickly supplanted by some slight tartness that you think will explode but just gets sharp enough to peak your interest but not destroy your taste buds. There are some pretty nice yeast notes mixed in with the malt and slightly grainy notes of the beer. Awesome. Body is light and refreshing and CO2 is near perfection. Good brew.
O - Awesome RR Sour. Probably one of my favorites from RR. Really well crafted flavors and tempered sourness as well as some nice creativeness. 1,267 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jul 01, 2011

S: Dry, winey fruit. Plenty of oak. Green, floral, and woody. Nice.
T: Much more sour than the nose, with rather prominent lactic sourness leading in to vanilla, lemon, and oak. Tasty.
M: Smooth, substantial without being sticky, and mildly carbonated. Pleasant.
O: I enjoyed this beer thoroughly, but really wasn't blown away like I have been by other RR sours. I'd really like to try an older bottle, and I'll definitely be holding on to my lone B5 bottle for a while. I hope it improves, but I'm sure it will be tasty regardless.

OG 1.062
Batch III. Blonde Ale aged in French oak chardonnay barrels with Brettanomyces. 375 ml cork and caged bottle poured into a snifter.
Appearance: Honey golden and bright, with hues of ripe oranges in the snifter. A very good off white and creamy textured head with excellent retention and good lacing. 4.5/5
Aroma: Sweet malts at the very beginning, followed by soft fruit and unmistakable sharpness of a sour beer. Brett notes seemed absent at the beginning but emerge with warmth. Still very estery, and an accomplishment in the sense that the base beer is not lost at all. Strong aroma of Belgian ale is always felt in the background. Toasted fruit is strong, so are rum raisin and oak. 4/5
Taste: Light and sweet on the palate with tartness eclispsing the bitterness often felt towards the end of a beer, and evolving into a tannic, dry and clean finish. Superb! The sour character dominates many notes of the aroma, but does not demolish the palate. I feel that this one could have been more complex if all notes of the aroma came through. 3.5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium body, high-ish carbonation and a dry and long woody finish. 4.5/5
Overall, I quite like it. Like Supplication, subtly sour and never overpowering, but very very clean, refreshing, and enjoyable. 4.5/5
EDIT: Dammit, the -11.5% seems to indicate that I didn't like this beer enough. Far from truth. I love it. Perhaps not as much as Supplication, but I still loved it. 1,456 characterstewaris, Jun 21, 2011

Pours a nice goldenrod yellow, and it is very well carbonated. But of course, never had any carbonation with Russian River brews. The nose is an immediate waft of Brett which is always a pleasant scent to my nose at least. A little bit of that French Oak barrel comes out in the nose too. The initial taste is dry and sourness all at once. Upon more sips a nice oakiness comes out and melds nicely with the Brett tones. I know the beer is only 7.5% but there is absolutely no alcohol bite or any semblance that this actually has alcohol in it. I might be crazy but the after taste is just straight grapes to me, like I have been drinking a wine almost. The mouthfeel on this beer is good, but leaves the mouth a little dry like a tannic wine. Overall another yummy offering from Russian River. 838 charactersdeathcharms, Jun 12, 2011
3.85/5  rDev -12.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 05x1E, brewed 10/16/2009, bottled 7/6/2010 using Abbey Ale Yeast as the Primary yeast and Rockpile and Brettanomyces yeast at conditioning (all according to Russian River's Bottle Log tool on their website, I wish every brewer did this!)
Aromas are initially subtle with ripe golden fruits and the Chardonnay oakiness that was imparted by 12 month's contact with the barrels. As it warms you get a little Barnyard funkiness which is typical of the style. Sweet and sour seem to be in balance so far. 
The tastes begin with wow, sourness in your face, did not see that much sourness coming (not noticeable in the aroma). Nice dry notes of oak and white vinous flavors. Lots of Brettanomyces puckery tang through and through. As it warms you get a little more of the fruitiness with apple and unripened stone fruit (plum and nectarine). You get a little grassiness and earth but it's in the background compared to the tart flavors. 
The mouthfeel is super spot on with adequate carbonation. Finished spectacularly dry finish from the yeast and oak aging. Quite impressive. I am relatively new to enjoying/appreciating a good sour but I definitely know this is a winner.
Overall, yum... perfect for a hot summer day or just a warm spring day. I wouldn't enjoy this as much in the dead of winter so I am glad I was able to sample in the proper environment. Recommended for any sour lover; this brewery clearly knows how to make and barrel-age a great sour beer. 1,467 charactersclaspada, Jun 11, 2011

Wow! Beautiful beer. Poured a hazy golden color (though sometimes crystal clear) with a big fluffy cloud of a head that retains well and leaves some decent lacing. Packs a fruity punch right from the first time the aroma hits; citrus and white wine. Tasted a lot stronger than it was. Lots of fruit, both sweet and tart, pears and peaches, apricots, and apple peels, wine-soaked oak, with touches of vanilla bean and lemon, toasted grains hint to a solid malt base. Nice and complex, balanced, light-medium mouthfeel, very dry, and highly drinkable. 590 charactersRifugium, Jun 10, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -5.2%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4one of the last few "tion" beers from RR that I had not tried. Shared this one with the wife after a blistering hot evening playing outside with the 3 year old.
Poured from bottle into a RR tulip and a GI tulip. Appearance is a slightly golden yellow. Poured very little head at all with no lacing. A slight carbonation pool was present in the middle of the glass.
The smell is extremely aromatic and floral. The aroma of apple and wine is very present and blends very well. There is a slight hint of spice that works very well with all the other flavors.
A very pleasing taste, you can definitely tast crisp apple as well as the hint of wine. This beer tastes exactly like it smells, crisp and clean.
Easy to drink. The mouthfeel just rounds out the experience. Very easy to drink.
Overall, I would rate this a very highly enjoyable beer. Not my favorite style, but is very enjoyable to say the least. Will seek this beer out again. 933 charactersbiglobo8971, Jun 07, 2011

Appearance is a brilliant golden color. This beer WANTS you to drink it. Absolutely stunning look. A billowy cloud of white foam crackled at the top of the rim. Yes please.
Aroma is a blend of floral spices and fruity citrus, a little hop note dances around as well. A sour funk typical with RR beers is apparent. 
Temptation, for me, had a sweet taste up front with a sour finish. A sweet then sour then, fruity progression almost defies logic. You're drinking a classy beer here, folks. An impossibly crisp ale. 
A fizzy, bubbly carbonation fits this beer nicely. Lemony yeast tastes linger as well, but isn't annoying - but inviting.
Haven't had a beer like this ever - haven't had anything like it since. Overall a very new experience and would love to imbibe in again. An interesting, bold 'American Wild Ale'/ 999 charactersWisconsuds, Jun 05, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle, batch 05x1E, split three ways and served into a 7oz glass. Huge thanks to mulder1010 for this long time want!
Deep golden colour verging on old gold. Pours with a modest soft, white head of foam that is retained throughout.
The funk is obvious, but inoffensive. Slight yeasty bread aroma, but otherwise it is funk and a little hint of coconut as well.
The taste is obviously sour as intended. Tiny bits of lemon citrus come through, the middle is where the chardonnay is noticeable, capturing all the delicate fruitiness of grapes and lacking any harshness. The finish has a small touch of oak, but is otherwise very well balanced given the sour nature of the beer.
The mouthfeel is smooth, silky at times, the alcohol is not anywhere near present, let alone there to burn. There is a nice softness to it, counteracted by the sourness.
Overall, a classy, refined, well balanced, but still sour ale that lived up to high expectations. 952 charactersMrKennedy, Jun 01, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 005 375ml poured into my bruery tulip.
Appearance- Pours a golden tinted lemon color with a two finger head that left a good amount of lacing. It settled down into a ring around the outside of the glass with splotches in the middle.
Smell- It has a great barnyard funk that I've come to expect from RR sours. But also has a great white grape fruitiness to it. Also gets a bit of a vinegar note. More citrusy fruits after the white grape. A very layered smell that I really enjoyed. 
Taste- Typical RR funk, barnyard, citrus. Where Temptation comes into it's own is the apple and grape fruitiness that you get from the white wine barrels. It has a lot of chardonnay qualities that it picked up from the barrels that are just excellent. 
Mouthfeel- Very carbonated. It seemed to almost have a champagne carbonation where you could see bubbles pluming up the entire glass. It has a very good mouthfeel to it. A light to medium body.
Overall- One of my favorite RR sours. I think this one is a great example of how close we can get to beer with sours. This sour is on the sour side of the spectrum. 1,105 charactersdookiepower, May 31, 2011

A - A healthy golden orange, only slightly hazy, with a finger or two of pure white head. Not any lacing, it seems.
S - A touch of fruity Belgian yeast, a little bit of bready malt. Perhaps some citrus. Smells like a good Belgian pale ale, but the aroma is a bit weak.
T - Oops, not a pale ale! Lots of citrusy sourness and some yeasty funk. (I still can't confidently tell the difference between pure brett and spontaneously fermented sour/funk...) There's just enough sweet malt to keep it balanced, but the overall impression is dry and crisp, almost like a dry white wine. Really tasty.
M - Relatively smooth, with a lot of carbonation. It fits the beer really well.
Overall, awesome. This is really good and the glass is empty much faster than I expected it to be. 863 charactersabraxel, May 24, 2011

3.88/5  rDev -12%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I am a believer in Russian River. I like their labels. I like their beer. I hate them for being far away and not distributing to Chicago, but that's really not fair at the end of the day. 
This one pours out and looks like frothy thoroughbred horse wizz. Ultimately, that's not as bad as it sounds, but it really was the first thing I thought of. 
In fact, it also smells as I'd imagine thoroughbred horse wizz might smell. Not overly sulphuric and not altogether unpleasant, but not exactly something you want to smell unless you are expecting it. I pick up a little stale wine on the nose that reminds me a lot of how my wine bottles smell when I forget to rinse them out after using them.
As for the taste, it charges through the door like a magnificent gay friend yelling, "well hey, I brought the Chardonnay!" The most interesting thing about this after the wine slaps the palate around, is how damned balanced this brew is. The citrus notes, the sour, and just the right amount of fizz. I like this. I could drink this nightly. 1,036 charactersjohnbjaeger, May 18, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter, this brew appears a perfectly clear golden yellow color with a fizzy white head that holds around the edge of the glass. Bubbles rise constantly through the body and a swirl revives a finger's worth of white head. As the cap fades, it leaves a leggy pattern of lace that sticks to the glass.
The aroma of this brew is lemony citrus mixed with a touch of plastic-like funk. There is a lactic smell and sourness of rinds. A light amount of alcohol is evident as the brew warms and it makes some smells evolve that smell funked and a little pukey.
The taste is lemony and lactic. There are some plastic notes mixed with mild fruits that are a little rindy. Seemingly toasted with some oak indications. The aftertaste includes some fusel alcohol that mixes with the oak to create a dryness to the finish. There is an afterthought reminiscent of nail polish remover. As the brew warms the aftertaste gets increasingly more grapey, vinous and solvent with alcohol.
This is a medium bodied brew with a high amount of fizzy carbonation. There is a big salivation factor with this brew and it is exceptionally easy drinking for 7.5% abv. These 375ml bottles are a complete tease. By the time I'm really into this beer and digging it, the glass is empty and I want more. Certainly an enjoyable brew, I just wish the price was more reasonable and I would drink it more often. 1,390 charactersstakem, May 17, 2011
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I know, another super-superlative (oxymoron?) review...
Batch 5 poured into tulip glass
Thanks again JCDenver!
Appearance: Very nice honey-golden color, slightly cloudy though basically translucent. Sports a short lived fluffy white head, which quickly dissipates and clings in strange little patterns. Beautiful beer...
Smell: Definite funk, slight green apple, very faint "bandaid." There's a slight bit of mustiness which likely came from the barrel. This is obviously a very "natural" smelling beer. The initial sourness on the nose seems subdued, though is there regardless.
Taste: Initial pucker, leading into a fruity and earthy bitterness. I taste some apple and pear notes, along with some vinegar-like astringency, along with some more musty/earthy wood attributes. Incredibly complex beer here!!
Mouthfeel: Certainly mouth-watering, as well as drying; which while seeming paradoxical, is quite enjoyable. Everything about this beer exudes approachability...and re-approachability
Overall: A sentimental beer for me, for I was introduced to it as one of my first sours. It's not overly sour, nor overly funky, and still not overly tame. It is a well executed and exceptionally balanced barrel aged sour, and one which I hope to have again very soon... 1,266 charactersamcmaho1, May 14, 2011

Color: Bright golden blonde. Very nicely carbonated, little to no lacing and it form a thin crisp whit head.
Nose: Plenty of white fruit: pear,apple, and not white, but present kiwi. A pleasant sourness hits the nose like a tidal wave.
Palate: Crisp, clean, bubbly, and soft. The light Tartness/sour dances on the tongue giving the mouth a pleasant tingle feeling.

Poured into my Russian River Belgian glass.
Appearance: Pours a semi transparent golden color with a one and a half finger white head. A lot of bubbles coming from the body of the beer, it is very active.
Smell: I can smell this beer from a good two feet away. A good amount of funk with some sourness on top of it. At times it smells very sweet and almost fruit like. Oak is not overly noticable.
Taste: Good tartness, fruity. Not overly sour. Relatively lighter taste. I feel like the Chardonnay barrel aging is shining through here. Very balanced. I really like the fruity flavors coming through here.
Mouthfeel: Decent thickness, well carbonated. Matches the taste very well.
Overall: I really like this beer. It is not in your face with any of its flavors. However, the balance is amazing and the flavors meld together in such a great way. Great beer and I would love to experience it again. 913 charactersOddNotion, May 10, 2011

S: Smells kind of similar to a wine, slight grape like scent to it with a sour scent as well. Hints of lemon and a bit of a yeast smell also.
T: Tastes pretty much like it smells, grape like flavor upfront, followed by the sour funk that is pretty tart, almost puckering. There is some lemon present as well as a little bit of yeast and citrus. Finish is dry and sour.
M: Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. Feel is sour, as expected.
D: This is one of the more drinkable sours I've tried, not too sour, nice citric flavor. This beer is much like a wine but has a sour kick to it. Overall, this is a pretty solid sour. 764 charactersmavbrew, May 08, 2011

Pours a slightly hazy golden with a tight white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles race to the top of the glass. 
Smell is slightly funky, slightly tart, and heavy Chardonnay. This beer seems to have picked up a good bit of the barrel character. 
Taste is somewhat lively. Nice funky overtones with elements of citrus, breast yeast, and a light tartness. The white wine character carries through from the nose. 
Mouth is light and oh so dry. Lovely and refreshing. 
Overall, this is a wonderful sour ale. Wilds are one of the final frontiers for American Craft Brewing, and Russian River is way ahead of the curve. 672 charactersmondegreen, May 05, 2011

A: Straw colored effervescent body with light head and delicate, champagne-like carbonation.
N: Buttery grape; not much different than a chardonnay, with a touch of sour, almost lemony, yeastiness.
T/M: Sour taste which is almost lemony. Sweet flavor of the white wine comes in front followed by the sour. Good carbonation--a bit dry, but very interesting. 
An excellent sour offering from RR. Still prefer the Consecration's tartness to this, but I really love the way that the wine barrel influences the flavor of this one. 576 characterspeacebone116, May 04, 2011

Pours a beautiful golden color with an inch of white head and tiny bubbles. Nice lacing down the glass.
Smell is of brett funk, oak, slight lemon, green apple, grape, bread, and small amount of vinegar.
Taste is lemons and apple up front, openin gup to funk, vinegar, then draws to a drying oak, funk, apple taste. Long but dry after taste that is comprised of funk and oak.
Mouthfeel is moderate, little undercarbonated, note to self- do not use Duvel tulip, tastes better out of a tumbler or straight flute.

Poured into a RR chalice glass. Clear yellow/straw body with a 1/2 inch thick white soapy that persists throughout. Crystal clear beer with plenty of bubbles rushing to the surface. Very white-wine like aroma; white grapes, french oak, apples/pears. Brett is prevalent in this beer with a medicinal/barnyard funk. Very faint acidic sourness in the nose too. Flavor follows the nose. Pale malt backbone, honey sweetness, grapes, oak, vanilla, slightly salty (olives?), and finishes with a dry medicinal/barnyard funk. Sourness is more mellow in this beer than the other RR sours, but this still creates a nice mouth-watering astringency. Bubbly on the tongue with a light body. Very well balanced, soft, wine-like beer. Overall, a phenomenal beer. 759 charactersmuttyd, Apr 23, 2011

A: Opens with a loud pop, clear pale gold in color with huge white head as a billion tiny bubbles rush to get to the surface. The head recedes leaving lace sticking to the sides of the glass.
S: Brettanomyces funk with a very distinct white whine aroma from the chardonnay barrels, a touch of pale malt, tart fruity sourness and some faint alcohol.

M: Very smooth and somewhat sour. Slightly creamy feel, finish very dry.
O: Somewhere in between a Belgian ale and a champagne, this is a fantastic beer. The moderate sourness really lets you taste all of the complexities here without bombarding your mouth with lactic acid.

The appearance is flawless. It's a crystal clear golden hue in both glasses with a massive fluffy white head and giant sheets of lace sticking to the glass already. Tons of tiny carbonation bubbles floating to the top. The head is like a cloud, huge and puffy with it's own shapes. 
The aroma is top notch as well. I am picking up white grapes, lactic acidity, Brettanomyces, and a bit of oak. Some light fruity notes of lemon and pear. A distant graininess mostly covered up by the wild complexity. The chardonnay definitely comes through a bit in the smell too. 
The taste is just as splendid. It starts out with a perfect light sour/sweet note at the beginning upon sipping and at the beginning of the swallow it gets the most sour with a strong lactic and lemon bite which is followed up by a perfect note of fruit that almost lends a sweetness while the tartness lingers, making for a most interesting combination. 
Mouthfeel is very light, yet the carbonation makes it super creamy and soft in the mouth in contrast to the sharpness of the acidity. 
Wow - I did not expect this to actually be a 5 beer going into it - but it just has to be. As far as pale wild ales go, this stuff is better than many of the true lambics of Belgium. It's right up there with Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, etc. but I think there is even slightly more complexity to it. This one has had some extra time to age and it has done wonders. I need more! 1,564 charactersroadhouse, Apr 21, 2011

Batch 5
A: Really pale yellow color. Proper pour and the beer is perfectly translucent. A good amount of pure white head (2 fingers approx) with really good retention and really good lacing.
S: The beer is in front of me on my computer desk and I can smell it from here. Really really strong smell. First thing to strike me is the very strong white wine qualities to the smell of this beer. Strong green grapes, lemon, green apples. The wood tannins come out quite strong in the smell too, which is surprising. Strong spices: pepper, mint and coriander. Vanilla. A little bit of hay and horse blanket. Not much malts or hops. Still, one of the most powerful, complex and inviting beer I've ever smelled.
T: After supplication, I expected a very very very sour beer. This is not the case. The beer is sour, but not as sour-bomb-ish as supplication. It has quite a good amount of acidity that shows with green apples, green grapes and (most of all) lemon. To my surprise, there is a definitive hops bitterness to this, a little bit grassy. Still a good amount of vanilla and wood tannins, thanks to the barrel aging. The spices are still there: pepper, mint and coriander. Hay and horse blanket. Perfectly balanced brew while still having a strong taste. 
M: Very light and fluffy in the mouth. Carbonation is high.
O: Extremely refreshing. Really taste like a more acid, fruitier white wine. Drinkability is off the charts, I could easily down many of those with only my stomach ulcer stopping me at some point. The alcohol is no where in sight. By far one of the best brew I ever had.
Almost perfect brew? Damn sure to me. 1,669 charactersflipper2gv, Apr 20, 2011

Notes of wine and roses as they say, very freshing smell. Full of yeasty goodness as well.
Taste is subdued fruitiness, with the wine flavor and a bit of oak coming through. Good malty backbone which doesn't interfere with the other notes. Very refreshing and satisfying.
Light but nicely bodied mouthfeel, and an easy drinker, this is not as sour as La Folie, but very well balanced and drinkable, sized for one person for sure, thanks to the folks at Winnetka Wine Shop for the taste! 654 charactersrobbyc1, Apr 17, 2011

Batch 005X1E
A - It is a radiant golden hue, ultra-translucent from a careful pour, and is capped with an inch of white frothy head. Great retention, collars and sheets of lace upon the glass, and a constant stream of micro-bubbles make for a phenomenal looking-brew.
S - The nose is relatively mild and belies the true nature of this brew. Brettanomyces is noticable, contributing a medicinal quality that sits above the pale and honey maltiness. Some suggestions of tart orchard fruits are also available.
T - The flavor offers a well-rounded array of gustatory curiosities, including but not limited to white grape, oak, lemon zest, heather, pale malt, band-aid, Chardonnay, apple and pear, apricot, Calabrese olives, vanilla (on finish), and karela (bitter gourd). The sublime balance and seemingly endless flavor dynamics exhibited are nothing short of phenomenal. The brew seems to get more mouth-puckering as I get deeper into the glass.
M - This is a beautiful balance of a lighter body that nevertheless displays some tooth, and a plentiful effervescence that piques flavor prodigiously without ever getting sharp or prickly.
O - Of the many bottles of Temptation I've had, this one stands out as best. This is, in fact, just about as good as any RR sour I've had (Beatification B2) and reminds me quite a bit of the very best bottles of Petrus Aged Pale (which are as good as it gets.) 1,530 charactersktrillionaire, Apr 17, 2011

I'm re-reviewing this beer, as I was not very into sour or wild ales when I first had this. I must say I'm ashamed of my initial review...my palate must have changed drastically, because this is a fantastic beer! Pours an almost-clear golden straw color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is strong with Chardonnay aromas and a hint of funk from the Brett. There is also some lovely lemon aromas and strong french oak aroma. Taste is initially fruity...almost juicy...with some nice tartness and lemon flavors. The french oak is very dominant and delicious in this beer. Not overly sour, and very delicious oak, chardonnay, and fruitiness. Mouthfeel is very crisp, dry, and refreshing...just like some nice champagne. Drinkability is high. Overall, my first review did not do this beer justice. An awesome beer that I would buy all the time if I could. 
1st Review:
(From Notes) Appearance is very clear golden color with a very big head on it. Smell is delightfully funky, bretty, and maybe a bit of lemon as well. The taste definitely kicks you in the face with it's lip puckering sourness. After a few sips of it, you can start to taste a bit of fruitiness. Not sure exactly what fruits I'm tasting, but it's not just sour I'm tasting anymore. The mouthfeel is awesome for this kind of beer. Very crisp and refreshing. I thing a 750ml bottle is all I could handle, as I am not THAT into sours/wild ales yet. I enjoyed Supplication and Consecration a lot more, but this one was still a good beer. 1,532 charactersDovaliHops, Apr 17, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Another nice sour from Russian River, though not as awesome as some of the others IMHO.
A: Straw yellow with a darker hue at the core of the beer. Nice lacing wing of bubbly head.
S: Awesome smell of crisp bright fruit and excellent deep oak. Chardonnay grape is present and excellent and little vanilla imparted from the wood adds to a great dirty farmhouse blonde malt base. 
T: Clean taste with white grape, oak, bitter dry fruit at the back of the palate and nice vanilla flavors. Semi sweet with a nice level of tartness that is pleasant. You can taste little of the blonde ale base, but not a whole lot. Not super complex but certainly good.
M: Super dry overall, especially at the back of the palate. Some juicy bursts of fruit up front though. 
O: Good. 766 charactersDreadnaught33, Apr 16, 2011

S- First wiff is a bit funky and sour. After some swirls of the snifter, a hint of oak joins the sour funky aroma
T- Starts mild before becoming sour and funky tasting. The oak wine barrel aging ads a bit of flavor in the finish
M- Light bodied and slick... light/medium carbonation
O- I enjoyed as I do pretty much everything from Russian River, but this one has nothing on the Consecration imo

3.8/5  rDev -13.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Appearance is exactly as you would expect -- golden blonde with a white head. The aroma is a bit funky, with that typical sour smell. I honestly didn't get too much from the aroma. With the taste, I got much of the same. Sour and tart, with a bit of oak -- honestly, I didn't find it all that complex or powerful. Exceptionally easy drinking, but I wasn't very tantalized.
This is a well crafted beer, but with the Russian River pedigree, I expected a bit more. I didn't find it particularly complex, and it was a bit tame as far as sours go. Don't get me wrong -- it's a good beer. But with a solid A average, I expected to be more impressed. 644 charactersMavajo, Apr 12, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Temptation pours a clear champagne-like white grape color with about 1.5 fingers of pure white head. Retention and lacing are quite nice. Also, this beer is quite effervescent; lots of carbonation rising to the top. Very nice.
Smell: I get funk, mustiness, white grapes and subtle vinuous oak. Not overpowering, but still nice.
Taste: I get tartness and mustiness up front, along with some white grape skin. I also get faint oaky notes, and can taste a hint of the chardonnay that occupied the barrels beforehand. Lightly acidic, but not over the top. In terms of sourness not real intense, but overall funk and flavor is very good indeed.
Mouthfeel/Overall: Just a little under medium bodied with great carbonation. Awesome mouthfeel. Overall, a superior wild ale. It's not overly sour but has a nice balance of flavors to it that isn't over the top. 866 characterszhanson88, Apr 11, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a batch 5 375ml bottle into my Russian River "tion" glass as it shall be served no other way. I've had the pleasure of having this beer on a couple different occasions and this is quickly becoming my favorite RR sour that is of the easier varietals (I don't legitimately use this term) to come by.
Pours a golden blonde in the fashion of drabmuh's golden locks as he emerges from a tranquil brook on a picturesque summer day in the rolling hills of Hyattsville, Maryland. Small amount of fuzz graces the top and dances off the sunlight, just nice.
Smell is subtle and tart with with notes of a moderately priced Chardonnay that middle-aged white women with frosted hair like to pair with a Fillet Mignon at an overpriced bistro (again, not a legitimate term) in any pseudo-metropolitan city throughout the east coast of the United States.
Taste is soft and delicate with some tartness that hits you in the corners of the mouth like the old A1 Steak Sauce commercials from back in the day. This is not an in your face American Wild, but it is tasty and the base beer really shows itself with perhaps a hint of Belgian flare.
Excellent beverage that leaves me always wanting more... 1,196 charactersLunch, Apr 07, 2011

lots of grape skin, white wine, champagne aromas on top of some musty yeast, some white bread, and other tart fruits like green apple, cherries and berries.
green apple skin, white wine, champagne, acidic citrus, definitely tart, with some grapes, dark unripened berries, black cherries, and just a hint of bready malts. 
fizzy, yet soft on the palate with a tartness that coats the entire mouth and puckers the lips slightly.
very good. not quite as amazing as I expected, perhaps, but still tasty with plenty of nuances that come through as the beer warms a bit. Another amazing beer from Russian River, though one that would never be an everyday beer for me. 772 characterssilentjay, Apr 07, 2011

A.
beer is a pale straw color....very bubbly with a pillow of thick white head. As the beer sits the head dies down a little and leaves some nice lacing on my glass. A slight haze after the final pour from the dregs but I kind of like that!
S.
A wonderful brett/wild yeast aroma. Funky barnyard smells with some subtle aromas of white wine/grapes. Not as funky as your typical Belgian lambic but definitely noticeable. 
T.
like a combo of a gueuze and white grape juice (however not as sweet) with some ever so slight biscuity malts You get that nice sour/tart bite like a lambic with just a hint of sweet fruit like grapes or pears. A subtle musty/oak flavor as well.
M.
light bodied with great carbonation. very effervescent qualities like a white wine. Nice slight tingle on the tongue before a slightly dry finish. A nice crisp/clean beer. 
O.
Such a solid wild ale from RR. A highly drinkable beer that would go well with a meal, as would a nice white wine. They're one of the best at barrel aged sours in the business. Unfortunately the availability knocks this down a bit as I'm in the Midwest but would grab multiple bottles of this every once in awhile if I could. 1,203 characterscetherid, Apr 03, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Review adapted from notes taken 9/19/10
Appearance: Light gold/orange color, a bit hazy, elegant lacing
Smell: The nose is exploding with sour notes, funk, white wine, some funky esters, alcohol - very complex, and the question is whether the taste can somehow work with all of these flavors...
Taste: Simply masterful - sour, funky, tart, dry, magical - the taste is everything that I like about sours combined with everything I like about white wines - simply an amazing combination of things going on, including the subtle yet good dry biscuity malts, slight alcohol, and some wood - I cannot do it justice with words alone 
Mouthfeel: Super dry yet somehow creamy and smooth, nice spicy alcohol bite
Overall: So good it could convert a non-sour fan
This is such a fantastic beer. Honestly, I am not in love with sour beers, particularly ones involving Brett. I also do not really love chardonnay. But somehow this beer compiles everything good about these things into one flavor. It is glorious. 1,005 charactersangrybabboon, Apr 03, 2011

I'm new to this style and I will admit there's a little bit of a learning curve but I think it's safe to say that I'm being won over and this one has gone a long way towards acceptance. It was just the right amount of sourness for me with some great flavors just below the surface. Thumbs up for me. 661 charactersnickhiller, Mar 25, 2011

A - Pale straw yellow with half a finger white head. Lots of bubbles rising up, reminiscent of a champagne.
S - Almost all Brett on the nose. Leathery, dark cherry, plum, some hints of white grape, 
T - Not as sour as expected. definitely follows the aroma, but the leather and dark cherry is pushed to the back. The sour taste is almost sweet if that makes any sense. Sour grape, apple, pear, but at the same time the sweetness of the fruits comes through. A slight mustiness from the brett and the hint of leather and oak in the background.
M - Thin bodied, great carbonation, fairly wet, but coats the mouth. Finish is slightly dry and sweet with a tinge of sour. Finish stays for a long time.
O - Fantastic wild ale. Sourness doesn't overpower the beer as it does in most examples. There is a fantastic sweetness that comes through in this one. Lives up to it's name and seduced me to it's nectar. 920 charactersGarrettMD, Mar 25, 2011

A - Pilsner yellow with half a finger of white head. Big bubbles and extreme carbonation. Bubbles are never ending.
S - Brett, sourness and a bit of white grape. Some cherry aromas as well.
T - Sour white grape and brett funk. Tart white grape, with some sweetness. A bit of leather and granny smith apple. Finish is complex and dynamic and a bit hard to pin down. Some young Bartlett pear and plenty of sweetness are present too.
M - Light body, intense carbonation. Intensely dry finish. Very good.
O - Brilliant. The white wine version of Supplication, it focuses on the best aspects of chardonnay while continually focusing on what makes beer great. Carbonation is intense but appropriate, and the sourness isn't too much. Leathery brett and white grape/ green apple combine to make a spectacular brew. 882 charactersgreenmonstah, Mar 25, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 05x3
Appearance -- Pours a bright golden hue with a slim fizzy white head that is woefully short-lived. Slightly disappointing in the appearance. Great color, though.
Smell -- Biscuity malt, muscatel, vanillin, vinous oak, bright acetic character. The aroma is remarkably clean and, ignoring the acetic character, incredibly champagne-like.
Taste -- Very champagne-like with biscuit and white grape, floral vanillin, cellar must, and mild acetic tartness. As the beer warms more acetic brightness becomes apparent. Finish is firmly lactic with notes of vanilla and white grape.
Mouthfeel -- Medium-light in body with medium fluffy/prickly carbonation. Feels like a fine champagne. Quite good.
Drinkability -- Temptation is so clean, so delicate, and so refreshing that, in an ideal world, I could drink this every single day. Unlike so many other American Wilds, it's really quite remarkable for being so subtle and nuanced. I especially love how champagne-like it is. Most definitely a world-class beer. 1,015 charactersyeahnatenelson, Mar 16, 2011

A - Pours like golden straw into my snifter with about of finger of bubbly head that dissipates somewhat quickly into a nice ring that leaves some lace; very visible carbonation.
S - Green grapes, funky farmhouse brett, pears, apples, lemon, and a bit of oak.
T - Sour yet sweet grapes, tart citrus and fruit, lemon, apples, pears, a little bit of oak and funk are there for sure too. This beer just simply makes my mouth water, gush even and keeps me wanting more.
M - Medium with lively carbonation, crisp and refreshing, amazingly well rounded.
D - I could drink this all day and night, it is such a pleasure on the palate, and any beer that literally makes my mouth water gets my seal of approval. This is an amazing brew that should not be passed up, ever. 807 charactersStoneBrewFanatic, Mar 12, 2011

Poured into a snifter, half an inch white head with lots of carbonation. Golden pour with a very opaque body. 
Smells like delicious stinky funk. Very musty.
Tastes very much like a geuze in my opinion. Slightly sweet, very tart with a bit of raisin. A little grape and some oak. This was a rather fresh bottle and I feel like a little age may do this one some good. Not nearly tart enough for my standards but nonetheless delicious.
I was expecting a little more of a sour mouthfeel but this had about a champagne like feel to it.
Apart from the cost, this one mighty drinkable beer. I would like to get more to sample but in the meantime this will remain a rare treat. 705 charactersbeerhan, Mar 10, 2011

A clear shimmering golden ale with beautiful carbonation and an appropriate thin white cap atop its head. Love it!
A biting aroma consisting of tart fruitiness along with some warm woodiness. Very nice.
Supremely sour and bitter; just about perfect! A biting tartness but with a surprising bitterness not usually found in other similar wilds. Balanced. tart, fruity, sweet, bitter: this sour has it all!
Thin to medium mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation, and some biting sourness--great!
Just about a perfect American wild. This one does everything right from the big things down to the little things. Leading with the out-of-this-world mouthfeel, the flavor and aroma aren't far behind. Spectacular! 758 charactersehammond1, Mar 09, 2011

Appearance - a hazy gold colour, with a finger of light head that drops pretty quickly, leaving a bit of lace just above the surface of the liquid, and a bit of a coating of small bubbles over top. I really like the colour a lot.
Smell - heavy on the lemon fragrances, with a good amount of barnyard smell, too. Little bits of oak poke through as well, but the lemon and the smell of clean stable dominate.
Taste - a lot of up-front lemon and oak, but the sourness is pleasant, not at all overdone.. The wild aspect of it isn't quite as dominant as I thought it would be. I like the balance. I expected a serious pucker when I took a sip, and I was happy (relieved?) to see that, while the funk and sourness are there, they don't overpower you. In addition to all that, there is a definite mineral character, and tastes of dill and thyme as well, which surprised me a great deal.
Mouthfeel - carbonation is champagne-like, and the acidity leaves the mouth waiting for another sip. I feel it in my cheeks and lips long after it's left my tongue. Very nice.
Drinkability - if I had another, I'd pop it open. I really enjoy this beer. Time to head back to the trading forums! 1,284 charactersJimLetson, Mar 04, 2011

Bright sundrop yellow in color with lively carbonation and some haze in the body. The foam on top gracefully clings to the glass and continues to hover over the beer. One smell and already my salivatory glands are reacting. Big sour lemon is present, oak, a pinch of vanilla; very pungent at first but settles down in intensity. 
The beer tickles the roof of the mouth as it enters the first few times. It's hard to pick out individual flavors, but I will attempt. Lemon (especially sticking to the lips), horse blanket, vanilla, oak, and modest acidity (for a sour ale) and pucker. The carbonation bubbles up in the mouth like a champagne, and it is extremely drinkable. 
Que delicia! Chalk up another tally for Russian River beers that deserve to be talked about. But like the other Russian River sours, is nearly a dollar per ounce, so bring your piggy bank to the store. 1,072 charactersDoubleJ, Mar 02, 2011

Awesome beer, I was tempted to give it a perfect score in every class because its beautiful balance and drinkability. The only flaw would be its sweetness.

4.26/5  rDev -3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4My second sour ever. Thanks to my girlfriend for helping me get a bottle.
Appearance:
A very clear yellow color with a single finger of head that dissipated in the time it took me to get to this sentence since clicking review. Carbonation bubbles.
Smell:
Kind of like white grapes. A champagne smell maybe, no hints of alcohol. Semi-sweet.
Taste:
More of that sourish white grape flavor, with hints of orange peel and lemony citrus. It's like a sour candy! Lots of character in this one. Slightly sweet malt flavor, definitely sour instead of bitter. I'd call it delicious.
Mouthfeel:
Thicker than I was expecting, and it kind of washes over your mouth and sticks to you. It leaves a bubbly sour film, which slowly slips away, leaving you feel like you've just eaten sour candy.
Drinkability:
Reasonably high. Due to the price and sourness (my tongue starts to hurt after too much sour), I couldn't drink several of them, but on the right night, I can definitely drink one and really enjoy it. 998 charactersevanlarkin, Feb 25, 2011

Draft to chimay goblet
App- Soft golden yellow with a fast receding one finger head. Thin lacing down the goblet as it settles after sip.
Smell- Very tart with a subdued grape note and a muted oak note.
Taste- Soft sweet citrus. Not as tart as I would have thought it would be. Had a commanding taste with a nice white wine note. Didn't pick up too much of the Brett in this taste.
Mouth- I didn't find this one to be mouth puckering tart or sweet. A nice light/medium body with a high carbonation.
Drink- This was a good beer on tap. I was expecting a more puckering sweet beer but this was quite nice and drinkable. Dangerously so. 657 charactersFosterJM, Feb 20, 2011
3.93/5  rDev -10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I had this in an 110z. Belgian glass at the Russian River brewhouse.
Appearance: Golden yellow. Slightly unfiltered. It has little to no head that evaporates quickly. 
Smell: White wine grapes. Faint balmy notes that are really overpowered by the Chardonnay barrels that the beer is aged in. Hints of bread. This beer gets better after a few initial sips as the ale notes begin to compete with the intial shock of the wine smell and taste:
Taste: This is a weird experience for me because I am not much of a wine drinker. I appreciate the idiosyncrasy of this beer and am willing to overlook its aging process. The belgian qualities of this beer become discernible if you concentrate hard enough. Banana esters develop with time in the cup.
Mouthfeel: Mediu bodied. Swishes well in the mouth. finishes well.
Drinkability: I am personally turned off by the wine taste but I do think this is a good ale. I'd reccomend it to people who like wine and would like to try a fine beer. 982 charactersBerkeleyBeerMan, Feb 19, 2011

Lots of funky barnyard flavors from the Brett. The beer also has some sweet fruit flavors of apple, pear, and white grapes from the chardonnay barreling. 
Smooth mouthfeel with good fizz from the carbonation. The finish is slightly dry, tart, and refreshing. 
This was a great beer, excellent balance, complex flavor. Russian River does not make a bad beer and this one is no exception to that. 602 charactersSiepJones, Feb 18, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks so much to tenderbranson69 for bringing this to our wild ale tasting -poured from the 375 ml into a tulip chilled. Batch 05x1
 The color is golden like sparkling apple juice with light haziness and thick band of white atop with tiny beads stacked upon each other. There are streamers of lace left adhering to the glass after the head settles. the aroma of malt and sour odors combine and are graced by the esters derived from the wine barrel which have wood notes and light fruit w/ mild hop aroma accompanying. the wild yeast scent is strong with both floral and fruit notes and acidic tangy smell is present in the aroma. Both mild hop in the feel and yeast texture which has lactic sourness and with tart aspect that are also fruity but not too forceful -delicate balance is shared between the bacteria and mild astringency w/ light touch of hop spice and alcohol. The wood provides a nice accent to the sour elements.
 The wine action gives way to herbal and tannic tastes w/ a sour white wine grape flavor up front. I must say I didn't notice as much wine barrel contribution when I tasted this on tap, but it is pretty apparent in the bottle -not sure how long this one was cellaring. The slight tropical element is a nice addition to the vinous qualities in this with slight spiciness from the yeast and hops. The hop presence is more assertive than in other wild ales which I enjoy -it is just enough to add to the fruitiness from the bacteria and not too much. I found myself really holding this in my mouth longer to pick out more of the flavor until a semi dry finish as it is swallowed. This is truly great - A beer I could never get tired of -the hop, barrel and blend of wild yeast and bacteria are all playing and major part w/ lots of strong flavors, yet it is pretty easy to forget the abv and drink it like its juice. I appreciate the effort it takes to produce a quality brew like this. 1,914 charactersSlatetank, Feb 15, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 375 mL bottle into a tulip. Batch 05X1E.
Appearance: With a slow pour to keep the yeast sediment out, Temptation pours a golden yellow color, slightly hazy with a modest white head. The head retains nicely and leaves a thick sheet of lace all the way down the glass.
Smell: Some barnyard funk, tons of oak, and great tart golden fruits. Tart apples, pear, and white grape are all present. A bit of grassy hops close out the aroma.
Taste: The sour flavors kick in right away. Sour green apple is the first flavor on the tongue, along with white grape. A huge acidic oaky flavor, from the Chardonnay barrels, complements the grape well. The Bretty funk and sour character builds and takes control after a brief grassy hop flavor toward the end of the sip. The finish is very sour, and the sour flavor lingers.
Mouthfeel: This definitely causes me to salivate profusely and my cheeks to pucker. Mostly crisp with a subdued smooth creaminess contained in the medium carbonation. The body feels a bit above medium. The oak definitely makes its presence known, and it is somewhat dry and quite acidic.
Drinkability: This is one of my first ventures into the realm of the true sours, and I enjoyed the trip. The nose and flavor are complex and interesting, and this may lead to a new obsession. The candidly sour flavor will not let you down this quickly, but it will be a fun glass. 1,395 charactersKickInTheChalice, Feb 12, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5batch # 05x1F pours a nice golden color with just a slight haze and a white head that really holds well and leaves lots of lace. surprising for an "american wild" ale. nose is sweeter than expected, with white grape, lemon, lemongrass, white pepper, cotton candy/bubblegum, and wet rock (and a touch of goat?). booya...! taste is tart and acidic, and this is where this beer is set apart from the rest of them. flavors are near perfectly balanced, and the flavor profile of the base beer seems to mimic a white wine, with flavors of bosc pear (among other fruits) and spice from the malts and yeast being harmonized with, then amplified by the flavors of chardonnay from the barrels, creating something that is for sure better than the sum of both of their parts. it is obvious that this is aged on chardonnay barrels, but at times it is not obvious which flavors are coming from the beer and what flavors are coming from the barrel. very very well done. seems like lemony acidity hits first to open the palate up for flavors of wood and fruit to slide down, leaving a distinct wet-rock and spice taste lingering for a second before a slight alcoholic warmth wraps it all up. medium body. long finish. virtually no aftertaste. this beer is elegant, well done and awesome. pure artistry. creative and innovative, and pushing the boundaries the way I would like them to go. I am hoping that in ten years, beers like this will be run-of-the-mill. thank you vinnie!! 1,462 characterstimtim, Feb 10, 2011

Batch 05x1E
My second wild ale from Russian River, this changes the barrel to a Chardonnay variety. Also doesn't use the two souring bugs that were in Consecration (Lacto and Pedio).
A - Pours a pale straw color, and very carbonated. Builds about a finger, finger and a half's worth of head, but unlike Consecration, it doesn't immediately and noisily fizz away, but rather stays as a thick cap for a pretty long time. This great retention could be attributed to the very active carbonation; wave after wave of bubbles rise from every possible spot on the bottom of the glass to replenish the head. Lacing is thin and sporadic, yet certainly noticeable.
S - The smells is crisp, dry and refreshing, bringing notes of grass, lemon zest, grapes, and a bit of sourness as well to the mix. Definitely able to get the grape influence from the Chardonnay barrel, and smells eerily similar to a glass of wine.
T - The taste has me confused. Is this beer or wine? If it weren't for the slight carbonation and sourness, this could easily pass for Chardonnay. The grapes really pop here and linger throughout the entire taste and into the finish. The lemon comes through in the tartness as well along with the freshly cut grass. Not anywhere near the mouth-puckering sourness of Consecration, but it does hit with a good dose of tartness.
M - Mouthfeel is light-bodied with surprisingly low carbonation given the onslaught of bubbles that can be seen in the glass. Tart but not overwhelmingly so. Finish is moderate with hints of grape, lemons, and sourness.
D - Drinkability is high. This beer goes down extremely easily due to the lack of Pedio and Lacto that are so apparent in Consecration and honestly has the flavor and similarities to a bottle of middle of the line Chardonnay. Great to reserve for special occasions and if I lived anywhere near to a distribution channel for this I'd stock up for the cellar as well. 2,030 charactersnhindian, Feb 09, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a chalice. Pleasant cork 'pop.' Fizzy with a hard pour with quickly dissipating head. No lacing on the glass. Yellow golden color with the slightest haze. Sour apple aroma very similar to a chardonnay (crisp, not the buttery kind). 
Lively carbonation. Slight funk dominated by sour apple, lemony citrus and wine. Delicious. Clean, crisp finish. Almost more wine like than beer. I'm amazed that this doesn't have any grapes fermented in it and is composed of grain. The malt has been transformed into something that doesn't resemble malt based fermented beverages. I want a wine snob to try this. Utterly complex. No perceivable bitterness, but not sweet. Dry finish with a mouth smacking tannic undertone. Yum.
An amazing sour. My wife LOVES it as well. 789 charactersnniicckkww, Feb 08, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 05X3
Body is a clear yellow gold. Half-inch head pour dissipates quickly to a collar with no lacing. 
Very much a white wine (chardonnay) aroma, with oak wood and vanilla, some barnyard funk and band-aid, and bready malt background. 
Tastes of malt and white grapes up front, then lemony citrus, finally turning a little citrus peel bitterness in the dry finish. Has lots of acidity, but is not vinegary--more like a highly acidic wine, but definitely a lemony dimension. 
Body is light and carbonation is fizzy, giving this a refreshing, crisp mouthfeel. Really scrubs the palate clean. 
This is a delicious sour beer, low ABV, very drinkable. While this would pair with lots of food, I'd love to pair this with roast chicken with lemon, garlic, and rosemary and some frites. 787 charactersBeerenauslese, Feb 08, 2011

A- Pours a light straw with a big white head. Bubbles coming up from Duvel laser cut glass.
S- Light oak and butter up front with some sour apple and grapes. Smells like sour dry champagne. 
T-More sour taste than smell. I get some oak at the end. Fairly complex, but not crazy.
M-Pretty heavy carbonation, but not too much. Slippery mouthfeel, very base-like.
D- Great for a sour, I usually cant have more than one sour in a night, but I could have some more of this.
Feb 2011 Batch 4 x 4 poured into a wine glass.
A. Pours a straw yellow with light white head. Lacing down the glass. Pretty hazy, but yet pure. 
S. Slight sour white wine. This beer is so vinous, but not in your typical red wine fashion, it's unreal. Tart apple, vanilla oak, and a decent amount of funk - like mildew stale dirt funk, but of course in a good way
T. Vinous in a white wine kind of way again. Very similar to smell with out that funk and a bit more sour. You don't get that stale earthy taste like in the smell. Kind of a bit more muted than the smell in terms of layers because the sourness dominates. 
M- Moderate to heavy carbonation. Not thick nor thin, somewhere in between 
D. I have had 2, 8 oz. pours already and will be revisiting after a porter to break it up. Love this beer and I mean love 1,334 charactersdrink1121, Feb 06, 2011

Batch 05X2E
Slightly hazy golden color with one finger of head that had good retention. The head slowly settles to a thin cap. Heavy sticky lacing is left on the glass.
Has a barnyard funk but it is not overpowered by it. The oak Chardonnay barrels play there part as well. A fruity undertone runs throughout the aroma.
Mildly tart and mildly funky. This allows the barrel aging to come out more. Slightly fruity and vinous. Finishes very dry.
Light and effervescent body. Love what Russian River do with their sour bodies.
Another amazing beer from Russian River. Not my favorite of theirs but well worth seeking out. 637 charactersmorimech, Feb 05, 2011

starts with a slight tart and carbanation buttles begin to help spread the flavors. hints of grapes and raison and some oak for sure. well balance. i enjoy the complete mouthfeel but i think it would do much better on a warm day paired with some fruit. 519 charactersemagana, Feb 04, 2011

Light golden color with effervescence and a nice white head of about half an inch that leaves a bit of sticky lacing. The clarity is stunning; no haze at all.
Nice okay flavor with mild sweetness and a hint of vanilla. A nice dose of grapefruit and tart citrus follow. Really nicely balanced aroma.
The taste is identical to the aroma. Nice mellow oaky start that has a nice subtle malt sweetness to it. The finish is strong with lemon rind and tartness. Nice balance here; makes for an enjoyable drink all around.
The mouthfeel is sharp enough to have a champagne-like feel to it. Great drinkability for the style; none of the flavors dominate and work really well together. 771 charactersandrewinski1, Feb 03, 2011

4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Vintage: Batch 004
Appears hazy royal gold with ample pure white fluffy, lacy-beyond-belief head that crowns the glass and stays there as a half-finger cap. 
Aroma is of sour melon, wood (from the oak I assume), funky yeast, floral notes, and lemon citrus. Smell keeps developing with time, with the lemon/flower scent coming through after the initial oak/melon. 
Taste is intoxicating, with sour light fruit initially, and a woody finish, with plenty of others in between, including yeast funk, white wine, and a tart carbonation kick throughout. 
Mouthfeel is fantastic, mainly due to that carbonation, as it rushes everything evenly around the palate. Beer is light while being well-bodied and leaves a nice dry coat around the mouth. Drinkability is really great for the style, probably because of how dry the finish is. This is a lot like a wine, and adds to it in so many different ways. Russian River just doesn't disappoint. 936 charactersveinless, Feb 02, 2011

The appearance of this one is a murky yellow, similar to most American wild ales I've seen. The smell is lemon with some booze, sour grapes, and funkiness to it. The smell is the best part of this brew - outstanding. The taste is sour grapes, lemon, and a ton of tasty oakiness in the finish. Very nice. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style, and drinkability is very high. Not too sour, mut rather just some nice juicy grapes steeped with wood. I can drink this all night. 646 charactersairohead2001, Feb 02, 2011

A: The beer pours a light, light, hazy orange with a 2 finger white head that has moderate retention and nice lacing.
S: The smell is of flowers, some berries, and acidity. There's a little bit of oakiness. Nice balance on the nose
T: The main flavors I get are sour grapes (although more sour than grapes), and some yeasty earthiness. There's a little bit of white wine, but I really don't get the "subtle oak" that's supposedly in here. Not as much balance as in the nose.
M: Perfect level of carbonation, and pretty good aftertaste. The viscosity is appropriate, though I found this beer a little viscous for the style.
D: I would have this again, but I'm not sure I would trade for it. It was interesting, but not mind blowingly special. It goes down easy. 773 charactersglazeman, Feb 02, 2011

Pours crystal clear golden yellow hay color with some crackly white head.
Nose is light and sort of tropical. Very mellow, with some creamy oak aromas, and a little mango and lemon zest. Sort of like champagne.
Palate is light and fairly thin. Flavors of lemon-lime, funk, a little something like malolactic creaminess, roasted apple, a little earthiness (like chalk) and very similar on the palate to Grand Cru Blanc des blancs Champagne. Somewhat tart, but not scathingly sour - incredible balance despite the pale & light malt presence.
Notes: Fantastic and subtle. Really reminds me of champagne in a big way! 739 charactersSFLpunk, Jan 31, 2011

Pours out a cloudy straw color with a white head with nice lacing.
Smells of sour and wine. Tartness and sweet sugar notes. A mix of lemon and orange peel.
It's got the tartness of the other sours, but it's dry like a wine. It's got a very light body and a fruity center to the taste. Lemon and orange peel are present in the flavor and makes more a very light sour.
Dry like a wine which takes a little away from the tart/sourness of the beer. It's a really nice light brew that sits well on the palate.
This is falling in nicely with the other bottles of RR that I've been having. It sits below Consecration and Supplication at the time being, but it was also the youngest bottle of the 3 that I've had. Still a fantastic beer. 821 characterscjacobsen, Jan 25, 2011

Leaves some clingy lace and a bubbly sheen.
Earthy brettanomyces hits the nose first, followed by some sour notes and a sweet, oaky presence. Light and fruity with the white wine definitely showing it's toothy grin.
Good balance of sourness and funky tart brett, leaning a bit to the brett side of things. Base beer is light and airy with some tannic wood and wine character. Not puckeringly sour, that is for sure. I was skeptical about aging this one, but after trying it I think it could age fairly gracefully as long as the bacteria can keep up with the brett. Pretty good sour here, I am surely glad I have another. 896 characterstwiggamortis420, Jan 23, 2011

Temptation sits in the glass a brilliantly clear pale gold, topped with a foamy one-finger head of pure white. The bubbles recede rather slowly to a thick, frothy top layer that grips the sides of the glass with sticky tenacity. Giant streaks and walls of lace decorate the glass as I drink. Pretty much the prettiest blond ale I've ever seen. 
Sweet honey and flower petals in the nose: orange blossoms, lavender. A bit of pale cracker malt emerges as well, its breadiness offset by an impressive tart brett character. It kind of reminds of sour skittles. Mild vinous oak and vanilla round it all out. 
The flavor is similar, though more tart. Subtle apple sweetness mingles with crisp pale malt, oak, a mild floral character and lemon peel. The sour yeast is impressive in the flavor, but doesn't linger on the tongue as it's sometimes wont to do. 
Rather effervescent on the tongue, the beer massages my mouth with bubbles. The body, though rather light, is pillow-soft, turning each sip into a gentle caress. 
Light and crisp enough to be quaffable, tart enough to keep things interesting. I was tempted to give this beer a 5 in every category. I'm tempted to have another. 1,271 charactersPhelps, Jan 22, 2011

Taste, white wine sourness, oak, grapes, so pucker inducing. Hides alcohol extremely well, extremely dry finish to this, very drinkable. Probably the least complex of any RR sours I've had, but no less good. I'd give this to a noob before Consecration or Supplication.

Maybe because of the natural fermentation and carbonation, but the shimmery look of the bubbles, and the nice looking textures are great. Light wheat color and white head that doesn't stick around.
S: Sour apples, oak and yeast. Really does smell like a low-alcohol wine rather than a beer. 
T: Not as sour as i expected, which was good. I thought that this was like a more subtle version of Supplication (is is supposed to be?). No actual fruit, but fruity notes of a pomme lambic, balanced sugar, slight woodiness. 
M: Bubbly and sparkly. Tingly and round. The best part of this Russian River style to me.

Comes to the table a fairly clear golden with orange hues. A light, bubbly head quickly fades leaving no lacing around the glass. 
Very bright nose, with tangy sourness and assorted fruits (especially green apple) in the nose. So inviting. 
Bitter and dry up front with some sweet touches. The beer is pleasantly sour throughout with apricot, apple, and wine grapes. A bit of citrus dashes through with oaky tart flavors, hints of Chardonnay, and some some soft funk. Finishes super long with tasty, lasting dry and sour notes. 
Lighter body, tingly, and dry. Dances on the tongue with excellent flavor and feel. Goes down so easy you have to consciously slow yourself down to avoid drinking it too fast. 731 characterstobin, Jan 17, 2011

A- Pours translucent yellow. Lots of active carbonation bubbles. Nice white caps the beer.
S- Nose full of tangy citrusy aromas. Some chardonnay hints come through. The "brett" funk still makes you wonder what your about to taste. 
T- Tart flavoring throughout. Get some sour apple, lemon taste, maybe a little cherry. Not as much vinegar taste as some other sours I've had, which I liked. Drinks kind of dry like a chardonnay. Still the flavors are good with the sourness along with some sweetness towards the end. 
M- Not quite a medium body. Lots of carbonation in this. A little dry in the feel of it. 
D- These sour beers still amaze me. At first I feel as if it's not what I would like, but as I make my way through the beer it grows on you.

A- A very appealing and pleasing hazy golden color with a slightly pale yellow hue. A nice amount of carb leading up to a slight off-white head. A piece of living and breathing art. It's a masterpiece: inviting, appealing and down right gorgeous!
S- Wow an array of aromas greet me. A pronounced earthy mustiness from the Brett is awesome, but the real art work is the crazy undertones of the chardonay wine and soft oak. It's a wave of sweet fruits, dry wine, woody earth and subtle vanilla. I love it and just want to keep sniffing and not ruin the experience.
T- A nice burst and punch of sweet grapes, sour grapes and earthy must. It's incredibly complex and every sip invites a new level of flavor. A slight warming and there is the nice and simple sourness with a very clean vanilla taste and dry, fruit wine finish. Utter indulgence. 
M- A very nice light and refreshing beginning with a prickly and fulfilling finish. The slight tingle, the simple and clean tartness and slightly sour pucker are awesome. Then the nice and dry finish puts this one in a class of it's own. 
D- Ummm, hell yes. The carb pushes the flavors all over and lets the experience stick with you. Fruit esters, tart, sour, refreshing and dry. What's not to like. A masterpiece.

4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review #200. 
Batch 05x01E. Opened on 01.09.2011. 
Pours slightly cloudy, straw-golden-bodied with a soft half-finger head that settles to a thin film-like covering. Bubbles stream upwards to the surface.
Temptation frontloads with tons of lemony citrus, green apples, green grape, and orange, following with a light, dry woodiness. The brett funkiness takes a backseat, complementing the citric acid and Chardonnay at the fore. Very clean, pungent, and rich. 
Taste is much of the same, leading with lime, green apple, and pear which lets way to hay and bretty earth notes. Letting this one sit in the mouth, you can just let it breathe to experience its progression. There's the tiniest hint of clove, but most of it is swallowed up by the tanginess. Temptation, as is usually the case in life, ends with a slight whimper - there's a bitterness coalescing with an almost-mute, odd mineral note. Otherwise, this one has a lot of finesse.
Silky, halfway-between-light-and-medium-bodied with above average carbonation. Dangerously drinkable, with just a hint of dryness on its finish. Delicious. 1,099 charactersVerecund, Jan 10, 2011

Pours a clear golden yellow with about a finger of fluffy white head. The head recedes pretty quickly recedes to a thin layer that is constantly replenished by the numerous streams of bubbles floating up from the bottom of the glass. It looks nice, but not really remarkable.
The aroma is much more interesting and complex. A mix of oak, green apples, wine and of course, funk. It's not quite as potent as I remember, but all the key components are there.
The taste is very clean and crisp and not overpoweringly sour. I get a mix of green apples and grapes. It's got a very dry and wine-like finish.
Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with tons of carbonation. Very dry overall. Russian River definitely has the American Wild category under control. Temptation is always a treat and I can't wait to have it again. 914 characters321jeff, Jan 09, 2011
3.95/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This is an old review that was stashed away in a notebook that I just recently found. Batch 003 (375ml) thanks to ThreeWiseMen. Sampled on 10/18/10 and poured into tulip.
Pours out a murky golden color. A white head emerges and then dissipates to virtually nothing. When compared to the Consecration we just sampled, don't see as much carbonation when held to the light. Body clears up a bit in light but still cloudy.
Much different from Consecration. This is much more white wine smelling and sour. There is a bit of spice here but I'm not sure what it could be.
This is very white wine heavy in the taste. Also has much for funk/sourness to it than Consecration. This is also isn't too complex, sort of a let down when compared to the Consecration. This is a great sour but perhaps the darker ones are the ones for me.
Good carbonation here and it feels much lighter to me than Consecration. I do think the carbonation works well for this but at times it felt a bit thin. Finishes with a white wine taste that I'm not sure I'm liking.
A very good, drinkable beer, but it is much different from Consecration. While I did enjoy this, I think that the darker sours are going to be what I end up liking a lot more. This is still a great example of the American Wild style and I'd pick it up. 1,295 charactersSwimsum, Jan 06, 2011

A: The body holds the bright noon sun hue, with a assertive white lace from this strong froth. 
S: The first waft of this brew shows the plentiful sour dosage and hints at a gummy undertone. Intensity of the nose is high and overall complex note develop throughout.
T/M: Smooth up front and citrus flavor project before a tRt sour in the middle to end of the body. Oak presences is great and Chardonnay is there as well. Mouthfeel is lush is flavor and still very light and drinkable. Lingering finish shows high sour levels and adds another layer of complexities. 
D: A light character while being a big, bold brew makes this one a very drinkable sour.  708 charactersGDBEERMAN, Jan 05, 2011

Some nice funky & fruity aromas abound. These develop more in the taste with sour pear & apple being the dominant flavors alongside the yeasty funk.

poured from a 375ml into a champagne glass
Poured a slightly hazey deep golden to almost orange color with a nice slightly off white head with good retention.
Forget what batch number I got but i think it was fresh and probably would have benefited from a little bottle conditioning. there was a mild amount of funk aroma, with the hints of wine coming through.
Definetly some sour fruit notes almost like unripened grapes. also could detect notes from the wine barrel. 
Mouthfeel was perfect, highly carbonated very light, and an extremely drinkable beer, 
As this one one of my first sours it was probably good to have a young one that hadn't developed to many strong funky smells and tastes, since I have heard that some people are put off when they try their first sour and its to intense 846 charactersrowingbrewer, Jan 04, 2011

s- funky smell, horse blanket, straw type notes. Some fruit is in there and hint of caramel
T- Funky and sour is everywhere. you can taste fruits and a leafy aftertaste!
M- I really enjoy the mouthfeel on this one. Like a good champagne. The carbonation is there although very faint. I really really enjoy this beer.

4.17/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured a slightly cloudy yellow to tan color, bubbly with a so-so head but very nice lacing. 
Smells as funky as any beer I've had. Tart lemon and white cake icing are the two things that first come to mind. Really funky with plenty of sawdust and freshly sawed wood (that's a good thing, I like the smell of sawed wood although I realize it's a strange descriptor). 
Taste... WOW. No shortage of that. Powerfully sour lemons almost like someone was making beer lemonade and forgot the sugar. Somewhat like a tart and dry white wine. Some crab apple notes. Woody like sawdust, like being in a large wood shop. Some metallic notes.
Strongly carbonated and medium bodied. Fairly dry. Leaves a lingering tart aftertaste. 
Hard to rate drink since I think this is my first wild ale. Thus I'll rate it as to how bad I'd want it again and possibly edit later if need be. This would be an occasional sipper for a cold night of hiding out from the weather, watching TV. I'd definitely drink again multiple times.
Overall a bizarre but lovely beer that I really enjoyed. 1,066 charactersAlCaponeJunior, Dec 29, 2010
4.76/5  rDev +7.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Perfect pop of the cork upon opening. Beautiful pale gold opaque liquid with a two finger head. Fairly rapid carbonation climbing through the beer. Lace remains solid throughout the session.
Smell: Smell of apple cider and faint citrus/hoppiness. 
Taste: Wow! Incredibly strong and sharp taste of apple. As it wears off a hint of bourbon/liquor flavor hits the front of my tongue. The smell did not prepare me for how intense the apple flavor was going to be!
Mouthfeel: Wonderful flavor profile leftover. Faint cider taste, no bitterness or booziness or carbonation. Amazingly smooth.
Drinkability: I tried not to drink this one too fast because I'm sure it's the last one I'll have for awhile, but I probably could have put down a whole case of them if available. Delicious beer and absolutely no let down from the expectations I had. Simply outstanding! 900 characterstburus, Dec 28, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at The Belgian Cafe.
I've had several different batches of this on tap and in bottles and always prefer the bottle.
Pours a hazy golden yellowish orange color with golden yellow hues hen held to a light source and a half finger fizzy white head that immediately fades into a thin ring. No lacing.
Funky tart aroma with lots of dry bretty effervescence as well as some earthy oak and light fruit. Hints of grape, cherry, strawberry and other berries. A nice combination of sweet, funk, tart and earthy oak.
Medium bodied and very well balanced with a very nice combination of sour tart/funk notes, oak, vanilla and crisp, light fruit. Although this beer is puckering with a very prominent dry funky brett character, it is probably the most quaffable of the RR sours. Lighter and not acidic/acetic at all really. Plenty of oak and vanilla from the barrel aging but also vinous with hints of grape, cherry and other dark berries. Puckering, mouth-watering dry finish that leaves me salivating for another sip. 1,017 characterscorby112, Dec 27, 2010

Lemon, sour, wood in the nose, 
Taste was of sour apples, cidery for me. Lemony I guess.
neither my friend or myself enjoyed this beer. That being said I can see how others really like this, my sour palate isnt there yet, ill check back next year. 489 charactersMurchmac, Dec 22, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a bottle into an Irish (real) pint glass in high altitude Denver, CO, on December 21st, 2010. 
A: Pours a pleasant clear gold with a thick, creamy, four finger head of very nice thickness, brilliant cream, and excellent retention. Remarkable and appealing. 
Sm: Wow. Fresh but moderate. Notes of wine, ester, fruit, hops, and even yeast. Very complex, but balanced. Hopefully the taste is similar. 
T: Yup. To a T. Smooth open, complex, incredibly well-built body, wine-ish climax, with a multinote finish. The notes in the body bleed into the aftertaste (past the finish). Russian river's done it again, and this beer supports my sentiment that they may be the best American brewery operating today. Hides its ABV very well. 
Mf: Nice balance between coarseness and smootness, wetness and dryness, but I should say the wine gives it an unnatural fizziness that could be better refined. It's bold, and it works, so this complaint is minor. 
Dr: I'm not the first guy to reach for this style, but I am the first guy to reach for Russian River, and for good reason. Even a stout lover like me will appreciate this beer. Definitely worth trying, especially if you don't like sour ales. Its taste lives up to its title, though it may only be a fleeting temptation at this price point. 1,297 characterskojevergas, Dec 22, 2010

375mL Batch 5
Poured in to my Brooklyn Snifter
A: This beer pours a murky hay-straw color yellow with a 1.4 inch of sudsy white head that recedes immediately. Fine wisps of lacing are left on the glass. 
S: Nose is grassy, hay, blanket, sour apple, and sour grapes. 
T: Taste starts with a very hay like, grassy, barnyard type funk that just sits for a bit. One that moves away, a soured grapefruit citrus comes in to give a little tiny pucker before moving in to a soured grape note. The apple flavoring comes in lightly in the finish almost as an aftertaste. 
M: Lighter side of medium body, medium carbonation, crisp, clean feel with a drier finish.
D: Goes down easily, pretty tasty, not filling, nice kick and decent representation of style. I may go for some of the other RR Wilds, but this one is nothing to sniff at! 943 charactersJayli, Dec 22, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Chimay Goblet. Pours a nice golden color with a 1/2 inch head that quickly disappears into a small island in the middle of the goblet. Mild carbonation noticable.
Smells of pale, bready malts, grassy hops, chardonay grapes, oak and a nice bit of funk. A slight floral note as well.
Chardonay notes are right up front with bready malts. I also taste some lemon zest, grassy notes, and a touch of wood. The funk is noticable but not overwhelming. My only complaint is that it is super dry. Makes sense being that it's aged in wine barrels but still, super dry.
Despite the price it is amazingly drinkable. Top notch sour, wild ale from one of my favorite breweries. 677 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, Dec 20, 2010

3.98/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Batch 3
Pours a very clear straw yellow, so i hold it up to my computer screen, and am able to read the text through the glass, albeit upside down and backwards, lol. The lace is like a wall on the glass, like curtains closed around an actor. but the show is just starting this time.
Characteristic Brett funk, both in the aroma and mouth it comes and goes not subtly but not lingering or overpowering, much less sour then other RR sours i've had. The natural raw fruit and granny smith character plays out in a grassy and wet straw like way, like you threw them all together in a bag in the sun during a hot summer day, and that's your lunch salad, covered in vinegar.
The mouthfeel is light and quick with a dry finish that stops short of puckering, which makes this one very easy to drink, while this is only a 375ml, a 750 would be easy still. 848 charactersChadQuest, Dec 13, 2010

A- Light, golden pale color with a bit of haze. Small head and little retention.
S- Nice brett character, you can definitely tell it is a funk beer that has been aged in chardonnay barrels.
T- Absolutely amazing flavor profile. So many flavors and layers of flavors. Acidity and sourness nicely balanced with the base beer.
M- Light, almost refreshing mouthfeel, crisp and highly carbonated
D- Very, very drinkable, if you like balanced sours. Needs to be served in brandy snifter for full effect. This beer is one to be savored and enjoyed. 629 charactersthebierbrewery, Dec 13, 2010
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 05x1F
A- A nice, dense white head forms over a moderately hazed golden ale. The sharp carbonation fizzles out quickly.
S- Lemon and sour citrus are the first aromas noted. Wet grass, moldy hay and some musty oak comprise the funky characteristics of the beer.
T- Lots of lemon, which works well with the sourness. Its a nice middle of the road level of sourness. Funky flavors come out behind after the lemon. Grass, damp hay, rotting wood, some notions of white wine, mostly in the dryness. There is something on the back that I can closely relate to hops and it very well might be hops. The citrus opens up to a white grapefruit acidity and juiciness. 
M- Sharp carbonation moves into a fluffiness. Dry finish. 722 charactersMbpBugeye, Dec 11, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Got some good news and decided to take my third journey into the world of sours. Batch 05x1F, bottled 7/6/2010. Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip (remember, collaboration, not litigation!).
Delightfully bright and clear, with a color that reminds me somewhat of apple juice, somewhat of rose gold. Persistent streams of champagne-like bubbles. Slight, white head with moderate lacing.
Smells: white wine, mineral, oak, granny smith apple peel, brett. I'm usually pretty meh about brett aroma, but here it's amazing. Not so much barnyard or funk, but leather and outdoors.
Taste is slightly less transcendent than the aroma, but still remarkable. Pleasantly sour, with green apple and some yogurt (or am I just imagining the lactic sourness?). If you're patient, there's a nice hop bitterness underneath/behind the sour. Finish is short, and slightly chalky. The malt reminds me of a communion wafer.
I believe there's only one brewery in the US that's capable of making a beer like this, and that's a crying shame. One can only hope that Vinnie Cilurzo is inspiring a whole new generation of brewers to follow and (dare I say it?) improve on his success. In the meantime, however, I'm seriously considering moving to Sonoma County. 1,232 charactersmrgnwlkr, Dec 11, 2010

Poured a hazy deep yellow with a three finger pure white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, nice sour, and a little funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, mild tart, nice sour, and a hint of funk on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this beer made me say, "Oh my God, yes!". Russian River was spot on with this brew. It was very well balanced on the flavor and had quite an excellent aroma to back up the flavor. Not very much missing in this brew at all.

4.28/5  rDev -2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Chilled bottle into a glass. Batch 5 (375mL). 
A: Pours a translucent straw / gold color with an inch of fluffy white head. The head remains at least 0.5" thick for the entire drink, continually refreshed by the active bubbles up the glass. Nice lacing down the sides as I drink. I actually left for an hour and came back to see it was still fully carbonated and lively. 
S: Tangy citrus leaning towards lemons, orange, kaffir lime. Some cherry, too. A nice oak undercurrent with some chardonnay complements and a wild, earthy brett funk aroma. Very rich. A moderate lactic sourness in the nose. This is much improved over batch 4: more expressive, lots more going on. 
T: A surprising number of fruit notes: green apple, lemon, orange, and kaffir lime. They lay an initial groundwork of sweetness and sourness. They give way to brett funk, earth, and hay in the mid-palate. Toward the end it tastes like white wine vinegar. I felt the finish in batch 4 was muddled, but here it is sharp and crisp. This batch also has a mineral note in the aftertaste. I'm picking that up lately in the Russian River wilds. I'm not sure where it's coming from, but it doesn't work well with my palate. 
M: Thinner than medium-bodied, with high, fine carbonation. It results in a clean finish that works well for the drying (but not dry) body of this beer. I am sure this will become drier over time, but I like the way it is now. 
D: Out of the gate, this is much better than batch 004 fresh. The previous two batches have aged very well, and I can only hope that bodes well for this one. Definitely a beer to stock up on. 1,611 charactersArbitrator, Dec 07, 2010

Batch 5.
Split with my wife on a cold, snowy, dark Sunday evening. I in my Lost Abbey Sinner's club glass and she in her Ithaca tulip glass... Hers ends up looking slightly better-- nicer retention.
A deep, slightly hazy, golden blonde with a soapy 1 finger head of loose, large, fizzy, off-white bubbles-- minimal spotty lacing. This isn't bad at all for the style-- but nothing really jumps out at me as being amazing...
Flowery notes arise and begin the bouquet... A champagne like zest plays nicely with soft white grapeskins, light hay, and oaky notes. Very pleasant aroma... Of course I love the tart acidic quality as well. The taste starts out light and sweet with big floral notes-- then it dries out a bit with done nice barnyard and hay notes... A crisp tartness is nice, but I think this will open up and become really impressive with some time in the cellar.
The body seems a tad overcarbonated-- which makes it feel thin, almost a bit like seltzer water... But a champagne quality is present as well.
This is not the best wild... But it isn't bad either-- the aging potential of this is something that interests me quite a bit. It is tasty enough to be enjoyed, but complex enough to age... I will update this review when I have an aged bottle. 1,321 charactersAleWatcher, Dec 06, 2010

A - Pours pale yellow with a spotty white head leaving minimal lacing down the glass. Quite pale but very inviting.
S - Strong sour notes up front with a bit of sweetness. Some lemon, white grape, and a few other earthy notes. The sourness is strong but not overpowering.
T - Tart up front slowly giving way to bright citrus flavors, similar to the nose, finishing with a lingering biternes that fades after a short time. A very nice wild ale, tart but not overpowering. My favorite of the three.
M - Medium body and head with moderate carbonation. Overall dry feel with a good amount of sourness in the finish, not lingering on the pallet for very long.
D - Very high. While it is a bit dry the sourness helps to balance it all out. One of the most enjoyable wild's I have had. I am glad I have a few of these in the cellar. 973 charactersorangesol, Dec 05, 2010
4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a clear straw/yellow with a thin, fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass.
Aroma is tart, slightly sweet, funky, earthy, fruity and zesty. There are hints of lemon, citrus, peach, earth, vanilla and sourness.
Taste is amazingly complex, there are layers of light malt, multiple fruits (apples, peaches, lemons), some spice, light oak, funk and a very nice tartness. The finish leaves tartness, white wine flavors and fruits an the tongue.
Mouthfeel is medium/light bodied and very effervescent.
Overall this beer is light, refreshing, complex and tart, though the sourness is more retrained than in most of the sour/wild ales I have had lately. Russian River beers are not cheap, but if you want to try a beer that will bend your perceptions of the beverage, pick one up. 812 characterstrevorjn06, Dec 04, 2010

Slightly hazed but clear straw yellow color with a bright white fluffy head that settles out slowly and leaves swirls of lace up the sides of the glass.
Aroma of green apple, kiwi, a bit musty, some mild yeastiness. Flavor is initially tart, some yeastiness rolls in, followed by white grape and some woody notes, morphing to cinnamon and ginger, ripe pear, and a subtle nutmeg linger.
Mouthfeel is crisp and dry, a bit puckery. Average drinkability for me as this one seems more like a specialty beer and not a quaffer. 601 charactersfar333, Dec 01, 2010

this beer appears to mingle with the best, its got a wonderful golden hue and just looks immensely tasty sitting in front of me. the head is thin and white and doesnt last very long. it smells like a good mix of funk, lemon, and hay. despite the fact that i gave it good ratings across the board, i feel like it really went downhill from what i expected. by no means does this mean its a bad beer, because its not. i guess its just the first example of one of many hyped beers that i was just expecting more. hopefully my second bottle with a little time on it will prove me wrong. it tastes delicious initially, but the backend lets up quite a bit and im left looking for more of a finish. the carbonation is just right. i enjoy drinking it, and were it not for the pricetag id be more willing to experiment more with it. perhaps i needed to have the whole bottle to myself but alas i shared with my girlfriend.. and she seems to feel the same way. also duely noted, as this beer warms up, it shines a bit more and starts to come a little closer to true form. ill remember that for next time for a better experience. 1,137 charactersKkottonmouthkngz, Nov 30, 2010
4.01/5  rDev -9.1%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Before I even get to writing anything else or noticing the color or head, straight away I get bubblegum smells wafting off of the glass.
I choose my St Bernardus chalice and pour from the 750 marked as batch 004X1. Head is white and ale is light golden and clear. Dissipation of head and lacing are both quick and tiny. 
Bubblegum wafts into oblivion and what remains smells salty and spicy and fruity and carnal. I am impressed with the complexity and the depth. I find the sea itself is presented in this beer; maybe the oak is the culprit here.
Taste is tart and bright with chardonnay complexities and a smooth balance.
Feel is light and carbonation is full while the finish is neither dry nor sweet, but neutral and balanced.
I have been holding this beer for rather awhile (6 mo maybe) for me and I am glad I got into it when I did. It is more drinkable than I imagined but mot worth the $23 price tag. I have had many beers that were more enjoyable for substantially fewer dollars.
I would say get some if you need a change of pace and have money to burn. It resembles a Flanders ale and is quite good if you like the style.

Poured into a tulip, a hazy golden/orange color with about one finger of off white hesd that dissipates quickly leaving little if any lacing.
Aroma is sour, earthy. Sour apples/grapes.
Taste is not overly sour. Fruity and tart flavor. You can pick up on the chardonnay fritiness from the barrels that it was aged in.
The mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Dry on the finish.
Very drinkable. Becomes more funky as it warms. I like this beer... 540 charactersInspectorBob, Nov 28, 2010

A: Poured into my Duvel tulip, this brew pours a golden yellow hue with a white capped head that is a little too bubbly and quick to die off.
S: The aroma is complexly loaded with sour white grapes. Slight oak and very natural grassy/field-like aromas.
T: My favorite sour so far, this Ale has flavors of sour white grapes, cider, Belgium clove and spice; all rolled up into a nice tart ball of awesomeness.
MF: Mouthfeel is a little light for a Belgium inspired brew, but well carbonated and refreshing.
D: As far as sour Ales go, this one is very drinkable, well crafted, and not at all to tart. 608 charactersTKEbeerman, Nov 26, 2010
4.26/5  rDev -3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this with Thanksgiving dinner (kept bread and water as a palate cleanser while I snuck this one past my grandmother pretending it was sparkling cider... you gotta do what you gotta do).
I have to say. Underwhelming. Combined with the positive reviews and the price point, I think the brett, chardonnay, and everything else mentioned in the description was just a bit too much. The appearance is downright fantastic light and golden. The head and lacing are wonderful. Its smell is funky and complex. There's a lot in there, tart, sour, dry, oak, and it's like they all come out in the smell. The problem is I just don't really like it. The taste is the same. It's a sour beer, and remains wild. But these can be hit or miss.
Much respect goes to it though, as the light body complements the nice carbonation to have an easy sipper. And it's again, highly drinkable for someone who wants it, but not for me. 
Especially not at upwards of $10 for a 12oz.

UPDATE: Original 11-26-10 review gave it a "B", but having had it more recently, wow... my tastes have evolved. I really loved this one. Truly truly did. Still an expensive bottle, and I think there are others that are a bit cheaper and just as good quality, but man this one is good. It's a welcome indulgence. Moving taste from 3.5 to 4.5, smell from 3.5 to 4.0, and overall from 3.5 to 4.0. 1,359 charactersafksports, Nov 26, 2010

A - Pours a hazy, slightly couldy golden yellow color. A nice well carbonated fissy white head forms about 1.5 fingers high. Head fades to form a nice collar of the same color.
S - Sour and funky with great fruit aromas. I get lemon, some green apple, white grapes and some slight banana. Also getting lots of great funk, barnyard brett characteristics as well. Really nice chardonnay notes and oak as well.
T - White grapes, lemon zest, chardonnay, and great barnyard funk, although slightly subdued on the palate than was in the nose. Oak is more apparent here than in the nose. Great fruit and funk mixed together with a nice dryness that reminds me of a saison.
M - Very light body and nice dry finish. Nice and crisp with very nice carbonation. 
D - Incredibly easy drinking even with the sour funky flavors on the palate. I could drink many of these in one sitting. Really a quality brew from RR. 1,022 charactersKAP1356, Nov 25, 2010

Poured into a small chalice, Temptation sits a cloudy golden yellow with a light and fluffy bone white cap. Head fades to form a thin collar.
Lemons, wet hay, peach, saddle leather and a strong presence of oak laying underneath. Reminds me more of a saison than a sour. Soft, but bright.
The palate is much like the aroma only I'll add sour green apple and white grapes. The oak also comes through much more in the flavor. Very nice. This isn't too wine like, the grapes/wine barrels add to the complexity and flavor, working with the brett as opposed to just existing in the concoction.
Very light and crisp with a dry, tart finish. I found this to be highly drinkable. 740 charactersColForbinBC, Nov 24, 2010

Temptation pours a burnt yellow orange at first glance, but when held up to light it's more of a lemon yellow. At its peak, there's two fingers worth of a frothy white crown. Retention is very good, but the lacing is spotty. The aroma starts out being dominated by the aroma of chardonnay, with just a hint of funk in the background though. As the beer warms though, the balance between the two evens out some. Still, I was looking for a little bit more in the way of complexity. Whatever I didn't find in the nose made itself apparent as I sipped on Temptation. The taste of sweet apples shows up first, before a brief, subtle flash of clove reminds me that brett and other wild critters weren't the only things used to ferment this beer. The back half of the beer is all chardonnay and sour/funk, and the two are almost entirely intertwined. I'm not always a fan of chardonnay, I find it to be a bit harsh in general, but the flavor here has a bit more of a soft edge. The mouthfeel is absolutely luxuriant. For a beer so dry it's not thin at all, and the carbonation is picture perfect, very expressive without treading into fizziness. I honestly can't think of a single thing I'd change about it. With an out of this world flavor and mouthfeel, and a restrained sour/funky contribution from a relatively fresh bottle makes this an incredible easy drinker. 1,552 charactersaxeman9182, Nov 22, 2010

Nice Wild Ale. The oak isn't apparent until the finish and the carbonation is just a bit more than I prefer. The mouthful is nice and not to thin or viscous. Its almost like a Saison with Brett added. I get some peach and white grapes that I'm guessing, comes from the yeast. I think this is an excellent wild ale to introduce people to Brett C. Its too funky and is a good representation of the style. I dont think this is one is too complex but all in all a solid offering from Russian River. 529 charactersAndrewNations, Nov 21, 2010

Batch 05X1E
Pours a cloudy golden color...lots of very tiny bubbles rise up to a short head that falls to a ring that leaves minimal lacing.
I smell an abundance of sour fruits...lemon, lime, green apple, with hints of sour patch kids, wood, pickles, alcohol, and a barnyard funk. I can go on and on...those who feel this lacks complexity must have their heads up their buts.
I taste pickles, citric acid, tequila, g-spot, and green apple candy. The flavors are not as complex as the nose, but still mighty fine...nice balance.
Lighter body with a citric acid kind of drying...it doesn't make me pucker, but it does attack my tongue nicely.
This is the first sour that I've had that I could enjoy multiples of. A very well crafted brew...two thumbs up and one bottle down! 803 characterssitarist, Nov 21, 2010

A- Pours a real nice golden yellow with a real soft creamy looking bright white head that's sticking around. 
S- Smells more like a saison than a sour. Very sweet fruity like yeast with some nice pale malts. A lot of banana with that nice stinging finish of grapes from the chardonnay.
T- Tart and sour for sure. Nothing like the taste, very pale in body and flavor malt wise but has a decent subtle fruitiness from the yeast that is complimented nicely by the grapes. 
M- Moderate carbonation being a newer batch, definitely noticeable. Real strong tartness on the tongue but finishes smooth.

1.99/5  rDev -54.9%look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 1.5Aroma:
Bright and tart, slightly metallic; lemongrass and peaches, with notes of saddle leather, vanilla, fresh cut cedar, and wet hay. Reasonable promise here. 
Appearance:
Very clear light gold, with a slight warmth. Pours with a light fine bubbled head that dissipates quickly leaving light lace. Appealing.
Flavor:
Dominated by a metallic sourness of a single focus. Lacking in complexity. Moderated by a warm fuzzy moldy summer fruit (peach like) funk. Finishes slightly astringent and papery. Completely fails to deliver on what small promise there was in the aroma and appearance. 
Mouthfeel:
A bit like diet soda, with a little slickness you might find in a light session ale with wheat. No redemption for the flavor.
Overall impression:
Perhaps I'm not the one to ask, because I've had many different lambic ales. Fruited, straight young and old, gueze. And I've had Rhodenbach and other Flemish red ales. That means I'll be bringing a higher standard to my evaluation than some others. 
The Temptation is thin and one dimensional. It is very unsatisfying - especially considering the price. I've had Cantillon, Boon, Mort Subite, and Lindeman's that just blow the Temptation out of the box with great complexity and depth. I finished it because I couldn't bear throwing $10 down the drain. 
If you asked me if I wanted another one of these - I would not be tempted. 1,381 charactersdfernandez77, Nov 20, 2010

A- A beautiful hay color that reflects light beautifully. a little head with intermittent lacing. Head returns upon agitation bringing great aroma with it. 
S- Barnyard and pineapple and orange. Perhaps apple as well with a woody smell too. Definitely smells like soured fruit. 
T- Surprisingly Saison like. Now it could be that all the saisons i've had recently have had Brett in them but it tastes like a slightly more sour saison or golden ale. Compares to New Glarus's R&D Golden Ale. Soured Fruit, wood, vanilla, pineapple, and slight funk. 
M- carbonated and sticky. lingers everywhere in your mouth and throat. finish is long and delightfully sour and fruity. 
D- First sour I feel like I could drink 10 of. Smooth, crisp, and refreshing!

Poured into a tulip. . .just as the bottle instructs me to. The pour is a very clean light golden color with just a thin fizzy layer of foam and spotty lace. As soon as I pooped the cork on this I got a big lemon aroma. The nose is full of lemon, hints of oak and cedar, sour grapes and a bit of brett and balances the aromas very nicely letting everything meld together to compliment. The taste is lemony right off the bat. Nice and sour with a little bit of wood and chardonnay flavor and a nice funky brett finish. Honestly, excactly what I would want from a wild ale. Sour and funky but not overpoweringly; just a nice brett and sour balance with other flavors showing their profiles as well. The mouthfeel is slightly dry but no complaints really and the drinkability is like none other. I could sip this guy all night. 919 charactersBendurgin, Nov 17, 2010

batch 05x1F
Pours a hazy yet bright golden straw yellow with an incredibly long lasting foamy white head and great lacing. There is quite a bit of active carbonation visible, reminiscent of a champagne even.
The nose consists of notes of brett, oak and chardonnay.
The time in the chardonnay barrels really adds a strong white wine quality upfront with sour notes of green apple and light funk notes as a very nice compliment.
The mouth feel is medium bodied, and active yet soft carbonation.
Another delicious and well done beer by Russian River. I really enjoyed the subtleties of this beer, as it relied only on the beer itself and the barrel aging. 682 charactersvkv822, Nov 16, 2010

4.21/5  rDev -4.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3One of the heavily loved beers from this local brewery...pouring a hazy, pale amber with some lemon peel colors, this is one unique ale. No real head forms, and it is super carbonated. Almost champagne like in carbonation. Nose is loaded with tangy sour cherry notes, sour apple (like an unripe granny smith type of sour), a slight Belgian funk and a sweet component, like a bartlett poached pear dessert type of thing. AWESOME is all I can say. WHOA!!! Flavor is off the charts complex - starts off super-tangy, like lemon juice. Some real sour notes, but never overpowering, if you can believe it. Evolves into a funky, junky amalgam of lemonade with no sugar, Belgian yeast, and some maltiness way in the back. This is clearly a World class ale, but only for sour ale fans. Finish is super-duper dry (none of the sweetness that the nose hinted at here) and long and has some funk and some slight bitterness, likely hop-induced but hard to tell. This is painfully expensive at $9.99/375ml bottle but worth every penny and likely even better on tap down the street.
What I like most: The aroma and evolving flavor profile.
What I like least: the painful price.
Verdict: World class sour ale, likely the best I've ever had, but off the charts expensive. 1,256 charactersSolomonGrundy, Nov 10, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I have enjoyed this beer many times, but this is my first chance to review it. 375 mL bottle labeled as Batch 5 poured into my lost abbey stemware. The appearance is a nice straw color with decent carbonation in the form of very small bubbles that forms a very nice lacing on the glass. 
The first thing I noticed on the nose was the nice funky brett smell with some slight sour cherry. 
The initial taste is of sour cherries and white wine. The aging in chardonnay barrels has definitely left its mark on this beer. Definitely some citric acidity to this one, and a very strong brett finish, but not nearly as much as I was expecting from the nose.
This beer has a very dry mouthfeel which contributes to how similar it feels to a white wine. The carbonation could have been slightly greater, but not much or it would have overpowered the beer.
Overall a great drink. I could easily enjoy too much of this especially because it is just so refreshing which is very nice for a wild ale. This would be a great beer to enjoy on a hot summer afternoon, but unfortunately I am reviewing this in November... 1,105 characterstjfinkle, Nov 10, 2010

A: Crystal clear apple juice color. Looks fizzy, with a small but persistent white head with a bit of lacing. Second pour to finish the bottle clouds it up some, though I left most of the yeast in the bottle.
S: Lots of wood. A strong fruity character that's grape along with something else. There's also that Brett funkiness that I still can't really describe. 
T: White wine is the primary taste here. Tart white grapes. It's also extremely woody, which adds a peculiar bitterness. Something else sweet and tart is lying underneath. Green apple maybe? Also some black pepper or something like it. Does that come from the bacteria? I have no idea.
M: Puckering, lots of saliva starts hanging around. Medium mouthfeel and high, fizzy carbonation.
D: Wonderfully complex and unique. I wish I had access to it regularly, because I think it would pair amazingly with food. 1,037 charactersCharlatanSin, Nov 09, 2010

Reviewed the morning (yes, morning, couldn't resist this one) 24 October 2010, batch 004x3, 750ml, poured into 2 standard snifters with a friend. Temperature is about 50 degrees F. The first pour had a 2-finger head with fantastic retention and lacing, and the second pour had a one-finger head, decent head retention and about the same lacing. The color is a slightly cloudy perfect golden-blonde color much like the color of any standard Belgian tripel beer. The aroma actually smells like a tripel that has been soured, and is loaded with oak. Although the bottle says it was aged in chardonnay barrels, I am not an expert in wine. There is certainly an aroma and taste of white wine. The sourness is perfectly balanced.
The bottle specifically says not to pour the yeast sediment, but I cannot allow myself to review a beer until the bottle is finished, and I won't deduct points for character that the yeast will add....but I have to explore and try it. The added yeast does not change the aroma, but seems to dim the sourness and add a yeast character. Very interesting flavor. Different, yet equally good -- give it a try sometime! 1,194 charactersToAzwethinkweizm, Nov 08, 2010

Pours a bouncy, spry yellow for its age, lighting up the early Minnesota evening like a young version of our nearest star (no, not Randy Moss). The smell bumps along nicely. Low notes of wine & light yeast continue the theme of brightness against the onrushing winter. Please, please Tempation, hold back the rain!(tm)
Temptation's bottle talks about "wine or beer" & this definitely threads the needle. Light, breezy, I'd like to enjoy this on a warm spring day, lounging in a hammock in a sun dress. Um, the wine makes its presence known in a drying, light, pear-like smack in the jaw right away, before backing off & allowing the spritzy, Belgian blonde underneath to shuck off her winter shawl. Brett is present but subdued, announcing only with a bite, rather than aggressive sourness. Complex yet approachable, this is a 750 ML that might contain a single serving for me. 
Excellent brew, & I'm not surprised, since Russian River seems to have figured out how to brew very good beer, across a spectrum, with amazing consistency. Here's just another example. My wild ale shy wife concurs; she thinks it's great. Winner! 1,354 charactersmaximum12, Nov 04, 2010

A: Ligh golden color with a hint of copper in a wider bulbed glass. Very active carbonation which makes for excellent retention of the light and delicate head that settles in.
S: Acidic lime aromas with defined barrel and vinous qualities. Light hints of animal and and barn aromas to complement the grape and pit fruit aromas.
T: Yum! Citrus and aggressive grassy flavors. Oak aged wine characteristics and kumquats. It just continues to open up and evolve. 
M: Most certainly puckering. Drying. Refreshing. It is heavy on the attack and persistent on the finish. For how aggressive this is, it surprisingly is not unpleasant or burdensome. Just a pronounced expression.
D: I could drink this one all night. It's weighted palate impression requires paced consumption. But there is nothing fatiguing here and the relatively low abv and slow pace of consumption allows for extended drinking. 1,029 charactersoregone, Oct 27, 2010

Pours a fairly clear golden with orange hues. A light, bubbly head quickly fades leaving no lacing around the glass. 
Very bright nose, with tangy sourness and assorted fruits (especially green apple) in the nose. So inviting. 
Bitter and dry up front with some sweet touches. The beer is pleasantly sour throughout with apricot, apple, and wine grapes. A bit of citrus dashes through with oaky tart flavors, hints of Chardonnay, and some some soft funk. Finishes super long with tasty, lasting dry and sour notes. 
Lighter body, tingly, and dry. Dances on the tongue with excellent flavor and feel. Goes down so easy you have to consciously slow yourself down to avoid drinking it too fast. A true delight and treasure from Russian River. 759 charactersxnicknj, Oct 26, 2010

Tiny little champagne like bubble continually run up the side of the glass. The nose is an interesting combination of green apple, white grape, and an all encompassing tart funk.
The flavor of this beer is phenomenal. This beer really took on the characteristics of the chardonnay barrel it was aged in. There is tart green apple and white grapes that dominate the flavor. There is a tart lemon mixed in with musty oak and wet leaves. Those flavors may not sound appetizing, but trust me - this beer is fantastic. There is a very dry finish with tons of carbonation.
I was a little apprehensive about this beer, because of all the hype it gets and the cost ($15 for 330ml), but I think it was worth every penny. One of the best American Wild ales I have ever had. I'm going to make it a point to pick up the other three Russian River sours available in the area when I can afford them. 963 charactersjlandis, Oct 25, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a golden yellow color with a small white head and plenty of murky goodness.
S - The aroma of funk slaps you in the face. It is very strong but mixes well with white grape, apple, and pear notes. 
T - The taste has a champagne like feel with some brett funkiness. Nice layers of fruit and earthy tones. Puckering finish that always brings a smile to my face.
M - Light and crisp. 
D - Very easy to drink and more so that so of the wild ales with cherries. 468 charactersCMW, Oct 25, 2010

Batch 05X2F
Much appreciation to Nickd717 for the bottle
Golden in color, there is a minute cloudiness from a little yeast making its way into the glass. Otherwise it was very clear while being poured. One finger head dissipates to a bubbly skim, though impressive, solid lace remains. Decent, if thin, retention throughout, though not much lace.
The aroma is quite vinous; flourishes of white grapes abound, as well as hints of apple. The first whiff struck me as having more of a tart quality than subsequent considerations, though there's a prevalent notion of sour regardless how strong. Swirling pulls out aromas of oak & undertones of funk. Vague suggestion of grains.
Whereas the nose seemed reasonably clean for such a beer, the taste is more geared toward the funk. Very dry, with prominent musty oak & Brett grime. Yeah, the light fruit aspect hits upfront & is maintained on the peripheries but the funkiness far outweighs the vinous aspect. Fine by me; I like that the mustiness is so prominent. It's the taste equivalent of hunting for records in the basement of the Galion Flea Market.
Fairly light in body with enough carbonation to accentuate the aforementioned tartness & keep things prickly. Temptation is dry throughout; the finish is no different. Lingerings of dust, dirt & 1960's record sleeves make for surprising ending to a beer than seemed so bright of appearance & aroma.
Drinkability is fine & as I mention above, I like the emphasis on the underlying funk as opposed to inherent tart & sour qualities. I'm also a fan of the more reasonable abv, allowing for such a spectrum of flavors without hovering in the 10% range. 1,689 charactersRyan011235, Oct 24, 2010

4.28/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Batch 4 poured from a 750ml bottle into my Russian River tulip glass. It poured a pale golden color with a big and bubbly white foam filling half of the glass. It had excellent head retention and left some nice lacing as well. 
The aroma is sharp with a good amount of tartness and funk to it. It's moderately acidic in the nose. A bit of a musty, basement like aroma comes through in the funkiness also. A bit of a sour grape, fruit flavor is present as well.
The taste has a bold sourness to it with more of a sour lemon citrusness coming through. It has a grape, apple, fruity and tartness to it as well. Towards the finish I get some of the earthiness to the Brett coming through. The sourness lingers for a while after the finish as well. Very nice and complex flavors to it overall. 
The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with high carbonation. Drinkability is good, it had some great sour and tart flavors to it overall with some great depth. An excellent American Wild Ale overall. 991 charactersbillab914, Oct 17, 2010

12.68 ounce corked and caged bottle sampled from a hotel wine glass!
Pours a hazy yellow with a minimal, but steady head. Good carbonation throughout.
The aroma is quite sour...very earthy. Lots of goo funk in the smell. Hints of apples, sour grapes, funky yeast, light hops, and some really yeasty notes. There are some other complexities at play here, too. Lemon zest, cocoa powder, macadamia nuts, fresh cut grass, and wet leaves.
The taste is incredibly sour, but with a nice bittersweet finish. There are definitely notes of grape, cranberry bitterness, and something like a fruity, cake batter-esque flavor. It's a bit hard to define. It is aged in Chardonnay barrels, and there is some good winey notes to this beer, as well. It is complex, perfectlly sour, and delicious.
Overall, I'm glad I got to try this beer. I can't find any Russian River in Ohio, so this is a real treat. This is a perfect example of a finely-crafted sour beer. Well-rounded, flavorful, and drinkable. 1,100 charactersmovingtrain, Oct 17, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Batch 05x2E, poured a rich straw-gold into a tulip with a quick-receding finger of fluffy white head. Sweet aroma dominated by grapes with additional notes of apple, honey, melon, and slightly funky Belgian yeast.
Ample carbonation and a light, effervescent mouthfeel. Intense yet balanced flavor progression with slightly sweet and lemony blonde ale notes quickly overtaken by puckering lemon and green apple sourness. The lingering finish slowly transitions from sour to a more musky and slightly oaky profile and then, amazingly, back to a different dimension of sour again. I could try to pick out more flavors but I'd rather stop reviewing and just go enjoy this one.
Absolutely one of the more complex and rewarding beers I've tried. I wish I was able to have it more often, but price and availability make this one a special occasion brew. 848 charactersgrittybrews, Oct 15, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pure golden hazed hue with a bright effervescent white head forming thick in my chalice. Aromatics offer up funky brett tones with hints of white wine acidity. Earthy herbal sour ale notes, this is something special for sure. Flavor has funky horse blanket, that coats the palate with acidity of the Chardonnay barrels. The brett and pedio are wild this ale is sour puckeringly so with barrel aged effects going on as well. Funky yogurt notes, barrel aged oak, sharp acidic tones this is pure sour ale. Mouthfeel is dry carbonation is effervescent body is in the medium range, I've had some nice sour ales recently this one is a bit rough with barrel aging but it works. Drinkability is fantastic the type of sour ale that puckers your mouth and gives you a full range of flavors during each sip. It's time to just make a pilgramage to the West Coast and visit Santa Rosa. 880 charactersWVbeergeek, Oct 11, 2010
4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Very interesting color. Very vibrant orange with blonde highlights. Head is pure white and effervescent. Incredibly bright and vibrant looking.
S: Chardonnay grapes and funk. Who knew that would be such a lovely combination. Lemon and grassy citrus paired with some barnyard. The Brett aroma is just marvelous here. Balanced extraordinarily well with the crisp Chardonnay grape aromas. The citrus bite is very nice here.
T: Very citric, small puckering effect. The Brett plays very nicely here with the base beer. You sense some funk when the glass nears the mouth and enters the nose, but it doesn't come through exactly on the palate. Lemon, grass, white grapes. Just screams Chardonnay with a fantastic beer yeast.
M: Really like how the carbonation of this beer is high, lends itself well to the citrus quality on the palate. As it warms, it only gets more palatable. Great mouth on this beer.
D: Only wish I didn't have to shell out so much to enjoy this beer. Money aside, outstanding beer. Not a beer to be enjoyed often, but certainly to be enjoyed. The sour quality of this beer is not overwhelming which makes it a highly drinkable sour. 1,154 characterskiddynamite920, Oct 07, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 375 mL corked and caged bottle poured into a snifter glass. Labelled Batch 05X2E. Served at room temperature.
Appearance: The first pour was nearly all head. After allowing it to settle, the second pour was about three fingers of pillowy white head with very good retention. Golden yellow in color and slightly cloudy.
Aroma: Sour lemon, some definite barnyard funk, some chardonnay-like fruit notes in there as well. Some tannic and woody notes in the background as well.
Taste: Not overpoweringly sour on the first sip. Lemon sourness is well balanced with the funk element. Some slightly bitter notes emerge as well near the end but are definitely not overpowering. The chardonnay gives this a nice fruitiness that counters the funk and sour notes nicely. Some oak notes also contribute but don't overwhelm. Very tasty and balanced.
Mouthfeel: Crisp and effervescent upfront, much like champagne. Slighlty dry on the finish.
Drinkability: The ABV really doesn't stand out and I wouldn't be able to guess it if I didn't know from the bottle. I could sip this all night.
Overall, another great Russian River beer and one of the best sours I've ever had personally. The balance of flavors and the subtly of all the components is brillant. Definitely seek this out. 1,284 charactersGosox8787, Oct 04, 2010

A- Opens with a super loud pop( i was half expecting this beer to be all over my living room table). Pours a hazy gold with a large thick white head. 
S- Strong lemon smells come to mind with a good amount of barnyard funk, almost smells like grass.
T- Not as sour as i was expecting but thats not a bad thing. This beer tastes amazing. White grapes and sour apples come to mind but as it sits and warms the sourness dies down and more of the funky taste comes in.
M- Lots of carbonation with a nice light feeling. A little thicker than champagne .
D- Dangerously drinkable i could really drink this in session if it were readily available.
My second offering from Russian River and it was just as amazing as the first. I cant remember who i traded for this but if your out there, THANK YOU. 813 charactersjoefuzz, Oct 04, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4My second time with this beer and I still don't know what to make of it. Other than this is the most I have ever spent per ounce on a beer and I'm damn likely to do it again.
Temptation pours out like liquid nitrogen or dry ice, heavy smoke-like vapors spilling out of the neck of the bottle. One gets the feeling he is about to imbibe liquid gold or diamond nectar.
Curse my mortal nose there is no recognition of this scent. It is lemony but sweet and funky, vinegared but not in a chemical way. Once it lets you in banana is there but nonchalantly. It all combines insanely to let you know you have entered the porous netherworld of shaven oak. This wins my prize for the most lo-fidelity of scents.
Sip after sip allows the strangeness of this beer to really sink in. In my opinion I am still being initialized into the flavor dimensions of sour ales and this is probably one monster of an initiation. I hate to admit that it is a bit much for me. I would like to taste a somewhat "toned down" version of this beer in order to see what's going on behind the acidic front. And without a doubt there is a LOT going on there. With Temptation more than any other beer I have tried (and I have tried a lot) I am able to taste the musky, the old-world, the decomposition of organics, and it is a dramatic, Biblical taste that fills your glass here. Take a moment to appreciate the microbiological aspect of this beverage. Okay now consume it.
It's hard to zoom out from the kaleidoscopic, mind-fuckedingness taste profile of this beer but it is worth doing. Temptation fills the mouth like no other. As alluded to by the snaking vapor that first met me from the open bottle, Temptation has a single place to go and that is everywhere. Picture writhing colonies of exponentially dividing shapes and cells. Yeah, you're drinking that. Go shit yourself.

4.36/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle into Delirium Tremens glass. Batch 4x3 bottled 6/2/09.
A: Pours a hazy golden with a thick bubbly white head that slowly faded into a thick film that lasted the whole beer through and left an incredible fuzzy sheet of solid lacing down the glass. Beautiful.
S: Amazing notes of golden fruits, chardonnay, tart peaches, sour green apples and funky brett.
T: Follows the nose with complicated tart golden flavors, a touch of peach and melon, lemon zest and a delicate barnyard horse blanket funkyness. Aftertaste is full of woody oak and dry tannins that round out the flavors. The brett and oak are so well integrated into this beer that it is hard to describe. The vinous quality of this beer is also incredible. The chardonnay really took.
M: Wonderful mouthfeel with just the right amount of tartness to make this beer super refreshing but not overpoweringly sour. Medium bodied with medium-tingly carbonation. Finish is crazy dry.
D: One of most well-crafted beers that I've ever had and perhaps my favorite RR beer yet (other than Pliny...and maybe Consecration). This beer is so clean and drinkable it's scary. Over a year of aging has only dried this beer out and made it even more complicated. Well worth the price if you can get a bottle. 1,260 charactersscottfrie, Oct 03, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This much sought after golden ale pours a bright lemon yellow with high carbonation and a light, fizzy head. It's nearly translucent when held to light and sediment is almost non-existent (if it's there at all). It sort of reminds me of Squirt, but with much more body and the welcome addition of alcohol (of course).
Smells are a sour beer fan's dream. Lemon juice, a Bretty musk and the dankest of basements come to mind initially. There's also a slight milkiness that is most commonly found in Berliner Weisses, despite the fact that this beer is wheat free.
Flavor is oakey with a dry conclusion and a tart sting on the back of the tongue. Sweet cherry and some light spicing peak out as the beer warms. There's also enough lemon to give the cheeks a nice pucker. Yet, it somehow manages to be a subtle display of sour and if ample time isn't put into tasting, some of the delicate flavors could go unnoticed.
The 7.5 ABV is also quite hard to pick out, making this an easy drinking Wild Ale. While it may not be one of the most assertive of the Russian River beers, it's still a great effort that could benefit from more distribution (PLEASE!). 1,152 charactersdeapokid, Oct 03, 2010

A - Clear, yellow body with a big white head on top.
S - Bretty funky aroma. Not especially pungent but you can certainly smell it.
T - Lightly sour taste but not much. A bit of brett but not much there. Light grape notes with a bit of oak. Real smooth and not nearly as sour as I was expecting
M - light bodied with a good amount of carbonation
D - Easily drinkable. Not nearly as sour as I was expecting and hoping for. A nice flavor but it just doesn't blow me away. I can go to the store and easily find several other sours that I would prefer over this one. I think I will revisit my other bottles at least a year in the future and hope they have developed nicely. 719 charactersjpmclaug, Oct 02, 2010

I had supplication last night and did not review it because I passed it off to the girlfriend who loved it. This bottle is for me, I no share. 
A: Dull yellow straw color. Looks like a macro lager. Thin white head that doesn't stick around.
S: Tart, acidic, and sour smells. Some oak in the back ground. Some white wine character, pear, sour apples, white grapes and some sweetness. Some funk but not too much.
T: Tart tannin rich and oaky. Pears, sour apples , white grapes and some light funk. This really isn't as funky as I'd of thought. So much acidic tartness rolls over the funk that would be there. 
M: Thin and spritzy, dry finish and refreshing.
D: Great. I love this beer and want more...I mean this sucks and don't buy it. ;) 832 charactersrwf08, Oct 02, 2010

Pours a somewhat pale yellow with moderate white head that recedes quickly. Smell is outrageous, big funky tart notes with a bit of oak and chardonnay coming out too.
Taste really kicks this one up. It's not super sour, but there's a sharp sour kick at the front, which moves into the oak and chardonnay notes, and finally melts into a creamy blonde ale with a lingering finish. Quite interesting, showcases all three components nicely throughout the palate. Very very good beer.
MF was pretty good, medium body with decent carbonation. It could maybe use a tad more carbonation, but that's about it. Coating, a bit of a dry finish, though not overwhelmingly so.
Good drinkability for a sour, it went away all too quickly.
Fantastic beer. Still a bit of a reach for $17 / 375 mL, but worth one try for sure. I'm a believer in all this RR stuff... but I guess I could pay $17 for a 750 of Cantillon and that would make me similarly happy. 1,122 charactersLordAdmNelson, Oct 01, 2010

picked up three. 
A: Very straw yellow color crystal clear with tons of effervesence. A very thin amount of eggshell color head.
S: Tons of sour oak in the nose. Definitely a dry chardonay aroma. Lots of Brett. 
T: Not as sour as I was expecting. An almost cider like quality where you get some sweetness along with the tart. I do get some oak as it warms a bit. Not a ton of funk. 
M: Very light and smooth. A very nice pillowy soft mouthfeel. Super easy to drink. Almost no sign of the 7.5%. 
Overall: A verynice sour. Not as complex as a Supplication or Consecration but smoother and easier to drink. Not as sour as the other two either. I probably like this a little less then supplication but it's still a completely amazing beer from Russian River. 885 charactersBigMike, Sep 30, 2010

Then beer pours out a crystal clear straw color with a nice head that resides a little too quickly. In the nose, fruit, Chardonnay, slight oak and a perfect amount of funk from the Brett. The taste displays the same notes but the flavors are accentuated by the ultra-dry finish and slight bitterness. The refreshing lactic bite but nit overpowering sourness make Temptaion unbelievably drinkable. KILLER. BEER. 490 charactersDouglas14, Sep 29, 2010

The aroma is full of yeast along with light malts, tart fruit and some hops, plus the typical scent of oak barrel-aging. The taste is very tart and sour up front and on top of that escalates into a sharp bite, with flavors of yeast, lemon, green apples and some spice that lingers in the finish. There's a decent hops presence that brings some balance. The malt character is pretty thin. The after-taste is sour and slightly bitter. Smooth and very crisp, light body, medium-to-high carbonation, clean and very dry finish. 634 charactersAnthony1, Sep 28, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +4.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had on tap for $5 for 1/2 pint. Yet another beer that made me jump up and down for. Pours a crystal clear, straw color with a minimal head. it's really just a ring around the glass. There is a steady stream of carbonation bubbles rising up the glass. It could pass as a lager, but has so much more to it.
Smell is of mild barnyard funk, a bit of sour apple and grape, and a tinny bit of oak in the background. I may not have picked it up if I didn't know it was oak aged.
Taste is much more forward on the barnyard funk. I pick up more wine like notes in the taste. No oak in the taste, but it is still well rounded with the sour and the funk.
This beer is the definition of dancing on the tongue. Wow, it was by far the most interesting mouthfeel. The sourness hits you at first in the back of your mouth. But towards the end, a sudden burst of funk and carbon dioxide creates what I can almost describe as a chalky, alkaline feel on the tip of my tongue. I have never had something feel quite like this.
This beer isn't the most drinkable. But it is something I could enjoy drinking often. I was quite happy with this beer. yet another world class sour from Russian River. 1,178 charactersmkorpal, Sep 28, 2010

S- FUNK~! Sour grapes. Getting a little bit of cherry too...probably from the barrels. Its great. 
T- the sourness is actually pretty mild in this one...nowhere near as puckering as Supplication or Consecration. Its actually really light tasting...grapes dominate the flavor, but there's not a ton there. Mind you, its done very, very well.
M- carbonated perfectly, very light feel...I'd say the feel is perfect. You don't get too much of anything out of this.

4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 05X1E. 375 mL bottle with cork and cage.
After months of sitting on a previous batch 750mL bottle and waiting for the feeling to be right to open it, I finally see a little bottle of new Temptation on the shelf. Temptation is a funny thing.
Served cool into my Watou chalice. The cork is removed easily and makes a good pop. Temptation is a golden yellow color with a slight haze. The head is short and tight. It settles slowly as more effervescence rises to the top.
The aroma is sweet and fruity with definate sour undertones. It has a nice light tropical fruit character but it is immediately obvious this was aged in white wine barrels as it has a lot on common.
The flavor is intense but not overly sour. At first it seems light and sweet, maybe a little like a tripel, with citrus and pepper. Towards the middle I start to get the vanilla from the oak barrel, some of the chardonnay, and a bit of the four wild yeast strains. It's not until the end of each sip that the real sour qualities come through along with a strong, dry, tannic finish.
Mouthfeel is medium-light in body, moderately carbonated and well-balanced. The sweet, sour, tart, and bitter flavors are all nicely integrated.
Overall an impressive wild ale and worthy of the accolades. And for seeking out! 1,287 charactersGilGarp, Sep 27, 2010

Aroma was all bright and lemony. Some nice wine-like elements in here, though no real sourness in the scent. Others report barnyard, but I didn't get much of that here -- Maybe a batch difference.
Taste was tart and sour with some wood in there -- very wine like in taste though there was some nice pils malt flavor, too. Crisp & very clean tasting for a wild ale. 
Mouthfeel was light & bright, spritzy on the tongue. It would be ridiculously easy to drink several pints of this if it weren't very hard to get in Alabama and not so expensive. Great stuff. 701 charactersmklinger, Sep 27, 2010

Smells like fresh apricot, sour lemon, white grape, slight funk, some oak and a little tart cherry. Clean smells.
Tastes more little grainy and very smoothly sour compared to the older vintage I've had (this is the most recent). Pleasantly bitter. Nice gentle apricot presence along with some sweet white grape. Entirely delicious fresh and with age. Mouthfeel is tingly and a little dry, medium carbonation. Light to medium-bodied. Refreshingly drinkable.

4.38/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served up a deep golden color without much of a head. I am thinking the lack of head is more the result of how it was poured than the beer. The little head that there is looks amazingly sticky, stays around forever and leaves frothy lace on the tulip.
The aroma is lactic and sour with some very nice apricot notes. It is sour, but not too in your face and has a complex aroma. Also present in the nose is sour candy, under-ripe raspberries, earthy oak and a sharp mineral character.
The flavor is quite interesting. Sour up front, but very complex in the middle. Barnyard funk, some skunkiness, lactic acid, apricot and full of unripe raspberry flavors. There is also a bit of citrus pith in the middle and some interesting sort of astringent mineral flavors in the finish. This beer is immensely enjoyable to savor, and has a flavor profile that is hard to describe.
The mouthfeel is medium and nice and dry. It is slightly sticky, but fairly clean leaving sour stone fruit flavors and citrus pith in its wake.
This beer is a trifecta of drinkable, refreshing and complex. I find most sour beers difficult to drink a lot of, but with this beer I could throw back a few and still enjoy. It seems to be the most sessionable of the "tion" sours I have had so far. Another big time win from Vinnie. 1,300 characterszoso1967, Sep 25, 2010

The head clings very tightly to the glass as I sip the beer, with little lacing as it remains in tight small bubble blotches. 
Nose has a nice sourness to it, with some stone fruit (nectarine, apricot), passion fruit, and oak. A little bit of sour funk as well, but not quite as strong as the Supplication. 
Taste is very nice, sour and funky (barn yard type of funk), with some of the fruit from the nose helping to balance it. The oak chardonnay barrels makes itself known mid tongue, leading to a nice buttery finish.
Medium body beer drinks very easily. The excellent carbonation combined with the oak makes for a good mouthfeel. Easily drinkable beer that can convert anyone into a wild ale fan. 952 charactersnataku00, Sep 25, 2010

Supplication is one of my favorite beers. It is simple, long (and well) aged, and gorgeous. At $12 for a 375, it is also expensive, but worth every penny.
Temptation .. is nearly $15 for a 375, at this price-point ... I expect sheer greatness.
L: Looks like champagne. Tiniest bit of head.
S: hearty and sour, with sweet and tart notes.
T: Starts sweet, fades into tartness, hints of licorish.
F: Light and bubbly on the palate
D: Good.
A damn good beer, but for the price, I'm still disappointed. Perhaps it needs time to open up? RR recommends cellaring for up to 5 years on all of their oak-aged beers, I will try that and come back to it. 724 characterscodewarrior, Sep 25, 2010

4.82/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to DaveJanssen for supplying me with this fantastic brew.
Poured from the 1pt. 9.4 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.
The color is a glowing orange/yellow with a good amount of carbonation and three fingers of foamy white head. Some thick lacing on the glass.
The smell is funky at first. Some banana and a touch of clove. There is a green grape flavor that touches lightly on the nose and then comes back to let the sweet malt flavor shine.
The taste is like a jolly rancher or a sweet tart, very sweet and sugary that is sings in my mouth and brings about visions of green grape fun dip. It is a roller-coaster of flavors that hit me over and over and I really am amazed at how complex this beer is. Wow will not suffice.
The feel of this beer is light and really tart. The wild feel is welcoming and sweet to the taste buds. If you have this beer it is a pleasure of the senses. It really is what most brewers dream of achieving. 940 charactersDuhast500, Sep 24, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This has always been one of my favorite sours. Pours a hazy strw orange color with a foamy white head and fine champagne like bubbles. On the nose you pick up granny smith apples, citrus with notes of oak and chardonnay. The palate is fantastic with apple flavors followed by oak, brett and small amoutn of baking spice. Overall this is a great beer, a must try for any sour beer nut. 384 charactersWhatsNewinBooze, Sep 23, 2010

Not surprisingly, this one was a bit funky, but not particularly sour. Aromas of chardonnay, oak, green grapes and brett. On the palate, I get more of the same funky brett, green apples and oak. A very nice beer. 299 charactersemmasdad, Sep 23, 2010
4.46/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bought at the Trenton Road Takeout.Poured into a tulip. A slightly hazy color.Amazing look as the air bubbles start from the bottom and rapidly rise to the surface to add to it's lacing counterparts. Leaves very good lacing.
Smell is extremely dry like a fine wine. Crisp zesty lemon aroma's with a soft touch of grain and oak.
Taste is a grand slam. Extreme sour cherry slaps the taste buds, makes the lips smack and mouth water. 
Mouth is lighter to medium in body. A heavy wine that wonders the palate and finishes crisp,sour and extremely bubbley.
Damn what can I say. I've had this on tap and now in a bottle and I can't choose which one is better. Amazing beer and one of my favortites from Russian River. Then again just about everything from RR is my favorite. 772 charactersTheFightfan1, Sep 23, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Temptation Batch 5
Temptation pours a soild gold color with a very thin white head. The aroma is good. Slightly sour, vinous, and I get a little bit of a cheesy aroma from the wild yeast. Almost Gueuze like. 
The flavor is fantastic. Like all RR's wild ales the integration of flavors is masterful. Sour, but not too sour. This beer reminded me of Cantillon Iris a lot but it isn't nearly as sour as Iris. The white wine barrels impart a rather nice shot of wood into the beer. More so than in any other RR wild I've tried. The mouthfeel was PERFECT. Slightly creamy, medium bodied. The drinkability was off the charts. I could literally drink this all night.
All in all another fantastic beer from Russian River. An absolute home run. 738 charactersBrew33, Sep 22, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a near clear yellow with a two finger pale white head that dissipates to a small ring around the glass in a minute but never goes below that. Leaves some lacing down the glass. Smell is of sour apple, some green grapes. 
Taste also has the sour apple and green grape notes, but is more complex, showing more of the oak and rounding into a nice faint bitterness that lingers along with the sour. The faint bitterness is the only noticeable remnant of the original blonde ale. Very very drinkable sour. Better than consecration, but a hair below supplication in my mind. Awesome brew. 589 charactersHURTemHIZZY, Sep 22, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 005. 375 mL poured into a snifter glass
A -Hazy golden orange color with a very soft head...it dies quickly and leaves just a tiny bit of lacing on my glass. 
S - Green grapes (probably from the chardonnay barrels) mixed with light funk and some sweetness. There may even be pears and apples in there. Very delightful, just not very pronounced.
T - Taste kind of follows the smell. Chardonnay flavors mixed with some light funk. Nothing over the top, but just all around very flavorful. Some light fruits, apples, and pears linger for a while.
M - High carbonation with a light body. Wish the carbonation was slightly lower, but it's nice.
D - Great sipping beer for any day. Though it seems fitting that I'm drinking this the last day of summer. 757 charactersKaiser81, Sep 22, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a corked and caged bottle, Batch 4 I believe
A. Pours a yellow to lighter orange with an abundance of tight little buddles. Decent head retention with some lacing.
S. A clean tart lemony smell that is followed by more pronounced horseblankety brett funk as it warms. Has some noticeable oak also. Quite intriguing smell, maybe could of used more of a tart punch.
T. Delicious. One of my favorite American Wild Ales. Its not super sour but has a very nice tart lemon/green apple flavor. Very bretty. Very funky. Very noticeable oak flavors. The brett/funkness is a little more evident than the sour light fruit flavor. There's also a nice bitter backing in the aftertaste. No apparent alcohol in the taste.
M&D. Nice refreshing mouthfeel, nothing crazy exceptional but quite solid. The muted sour aspect keeps this dangerously drinkable.
Note: I had this on tap at the brewery which inspired me to purchase this bottle. I must say I enjoyed the on tap version slightly more than the bottled version but did not want to review it while enjoying some beers with company at the brewery. However I may up the smell and mouthfeel slightly for the on tap version. Overall an excellent example of an American Wild Ale. 1,227 charactersDspohn, Sep 22, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is an outstanding beer and in my opinion essentially a paradigmatic example of what a wild ale really should be like, very characterful yet restrained, complex, and exceedingly well-rounded and balanced.
Golden yellow, faintly hazy, it has a smallish but firm white head, slowly shrinking, and leaving nice lace.
Aroma is very much a wild ale, gueuze-like, strong yet not too strong, balanced and complex. It has faint sourness, strong yeastiness, light but definite funkiness in general, nice citric, acidic fruitiness.
Taste is very complex, very well-rounded and balanced, characterful and overall outstanding. The elements are firm yet gentle. Gently sour, citric, and yeasty with light juiciness, it has a light but very firm woodiness that takes over at the finish, developing into a long aftertaste predominantly characterised by fruit, mostly pear, and faintly yeasty grain.
Feel is firm but lively and light. 926 charactersOffa, Sep 21, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a lightly veiled straw with a thick foam that expertly lingers at the brink of out-of-control. The head leaves a prodigious lattice-work of bubbles down the side of the glass that lasts for the rest of the evening and into tomorrow.
Light smells of lemon, biscuit, banana and oak are released by the foam.
Mouthfeel is appropriately light with vigorous carbonation that brings the tartness straight to the tip of your tongue. 
The oak and white-wine flavors are at the forefront along with some lemon tartness that emerges late. There is very little of the barnyard-hay flavors that dominate other wild ales which makes this an accessible introduction to the style. The sour flavors are not allowed to dominate. The sourness fades out during a light, crisp finish. Those looking for a sour-bomb will be disappointed, but if you're looking for a pleasant, tart alternative to white wine that goes great with food, look no further. 
On the pairing front, Temptation is a near-perfect complement to sushi. The subtle tartness melds well with the vinegar in the rice but is not strong enough to overwhelm some of the more delicate fish flavors. 1,150 characterschicagobeerriot, Sep 21, 2010

A - bit over a finger of rich and bubbly white colored foam, retreats slowly and leaves random sticky lacing on the glass. the beer is slightly hazy, brigh golden in color. 
S - rich and "floral" with a light (but very pleasant) touch of wild yeasty funk, lemony tartness, white grapes, oak, and cherries.
T - begins with both bright fruity and tart flavors of lemon and cherries balanced by a healthy live field and funky yeastiness. sweetness chimes in the second half with an abundant amount of oak and white grape meat. the wine flavors really come out here, moreso than maybe any other beer i've ever had. 
M - meidum bodied with crisp yet subdued carbonation, allows the flavors to dance around nicely. just about perfectly dry in the finish, with some lingering sweetness and tart. a pleasure to drink.
D - its strongest suit is in its balance...sour and tart enough to ease a craving, yet not wearing or distracting. allows more of the subtle flavors to not only make an appearance but play around a bit as well, something other Wilds can suffer from. held up to my hearty and sweet breakfast, a great match. 1,190 charactersStigs, Sep 20, 2010

A- Golden Straw colored, maybe a touch of amber. Pours with a light white head, not a lot of head and not much lacing.
S- Smells parfumey, with smells of funk and citrus. Touches of oakiness and wine.
T- Not as sour as I expected, more smooth and tart. Has a light touch of funk. The dominant tastes are oak and chardonnay, maybe even a touch of citrus
M-Quite smooth, with a touch of sourness. Has a nice tingly mouthfeel. Very nice and probably the most complex part of this beer.
D- Very drinkable, due to the lack of acidity/sourness that I am used to from RR's other sours. It's nice, and I drank it very quickly.
I had particularly high hopes for this one, as Supplication is one of my favorite sours. I feel like this was a good beer, but not quite exceptional. The sourness was there, but not really what I expect having had most of RR's other sours. 
Have a few more bottles that I plan on aging, we'll see how it develops. 1,033 charactersGfunk720, Sep 20, 2010

SM- A small amount of funk,, balanced with lactic tartness, chardonnay and sweet blonde malts.
Ta- Ecstasy. The fruitiness of the Belgian blonde yeast plays off of the oakniess form the chardonnay barrels. The complexity of goat cheese and other funk flavors meld into the blonde malty goodness.

4.28/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at Tony's Darts Away; poured into a goblet.
Ours a straw yellow with a pinky fingers worth of soft head; chill haze.
On the nose funky must, wood, fresh apricots and chardonnay grape sweetness; definitely a funky sour nose albeit slightly subdued.
Tartness reaches full volume on the taste in the middle, and ends slightly sweet giving way to a dry semi-lingering tartness. It is definitely less tart than I was anticipating. It is lightly effervescent, a touch creamy, and fizzles on the sides of your tongue; faintly tongue drying but closer to neutral. Pale malt sweetness, fresh grapes, funk, and some faint lemon acidity; I was expecting more acidity and I was pleasantly surprised. There is a peppery/wood component that I believe is flavor associated with barrel aging. In any event, it rounds out the flavor. 
The drinkability is just excellent. The flavors are well balanced and integrated. A great sour. 924 charactersTheJollyHop, Sep 17, 2010

Tastes of tart green apples and white grapes. Barnyard funk, spicy oak, and chardonnay. Fruity and delicate.

pours a luminous golden/straw yellow with about a finger of white head; so-so retention that mostly recedes into a ring around the sides of the glass; decent lacing.
chardonnay leads the way in the aroma, followed by oak, fruits, and some subtle notes of both funk and tartness.
flavor - in addition to the wine, oak, and funk - opens up to more fruit characteristics (green apple, pear, lemon), a touch of hoppiness and spices. a pleasant sourness courses throughout; a dry finish. hands down the most interesting, original beer i've ever had. for my money the creme de la creme in its style (and i am rating with style heavily in mind here).
light-bodied, tangy mouthfeel, pretty well carbonated. one you'll want to nurse and savor. 796 charactersperrymarcus, Sep 13, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Batch 5. Poured from the bottle into a Russian River glass.
The pour is a beautiful light golden color, almost straw-like. A cap of white fizzy bubbles struggle against the acidity of the brew, but manage to hold a thin layer at the top. 
Full sweet and unripe fruit with a prominent funky background. Pears, unripe apples, and apricots. The chardonnay barrels come through here a bit. Pineapple? Fantastic.
The taste follows the nose for the most part. A bit vinous, and not quite as sour as I'd like. In addition to the fruit component, there is a distinct grassy characteristic on the back end balancing out the light sweetness at the front. Slightly sour throughout. Slight tannins. The swallow is a bit astringent. This is very good, but I've had better from Russian River.
Mouthfeel is very good. Spritzy, but not overcarbonated. Very, very dry finish.
Drinkability is about as good as it gets. Can drink this all night.
This is an excellent beer. However, the Batch 3 Temptation that I had (thanks, Blake) was one of the best beers I have ever had in my life. The last two batches, while obviously very good, still do not match up to that batch. Highly recommended nonetheless. 1,190 charactersdavod23, Sep 13, 2010

A- Bright straw yellow color, nice white lavcing on the glass from the paper white head. The head retention is awesome on this beer, always has a decent head to it.
S- Dry citrus in the nose, with very slight hints of sour/vinegar. Smells like an amazing sour should. Lots of wood, with some hints of chardonnay.
T- This beer to me has an amazing flavor. The combination of the wood and the lactic acid make for a bright, sour, and dry flavor. Very refreshing and delicious.
D- I love this beer (as ive said earlier) but i feel dispite my bias that this beer drinks beautifully. it reminds me of an awesome gueuze you could drink everyday, especially on a warm day in the backyard with friends. 770 charactersKshock, Sep 12, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy, golden color, throwing up a quarter inch, white, bubbly head that disappears quickly, leaving a whisp of carbonation on the surface of the beer.
The aroma is tart, green fruits, dry like a white wine and acidic with a touch of scumm. Mostly acidic, tart green fruit aromas though.
The flavor really packs a punch. Very tart, like a salted green apple. Also a sour reminiscent of an unripe lemon. Sour and tart. That said, there is a balancing sweetness, honey, pale malt-like in character. The finish is dry, leaving a sharp tartness at the very back of the throat.
I wish I could better communicate the flavors I'm tasting. There is just so much going on, and combined with the light, dry mouthfeel, makes for one intense brew! Definitely one of my favorite sours from RR. 790 charactersSoneast, Sep 10, 2010

Poured into a Delirium Tremens tulip from batch 5x1E.
Pours a beautiful deep goldenrod color with two fingers of fluffy white head that lingers in a creamy white layer on top. Leaves a tight, fine lacing on the glass.
Aroma is tart and vinous with just a bit of funkiness in the back if you stick your nose in the glass long enough. This is really intoxicating. I just want to sniff this beer more.
Taste is, omg the taste is fricking noms. Tart up front with hints of lemoniness in there that fades to a just slightly bitter, woody, earthiness in the finish.
Allowing this delectable nominess to swirl in your mouth leaves it feeling tingly with a moderately dry finish.
For a sour this beer is pretty drinkable. It didn't leave my tastebuds feeling bent over and violated like some have in the past (not a bad thing mind you).
Overall I have to give Temptation two noms up. :) 1,099 charactersirishgurl4, Sep 09, 2010

taste is great for the style - bright, fruity, very sour and puckering but not too much - some woody, leather backbone in there too.

A: This stuff looks amazing - pours a golden straw-like hue that is slightly hazy and very effervescent with a decent head and solid lacing from start to finish.
S: Funky woodiness with some sour apple, pepper and citrus. To be honest, I expected a little more out of the smell; don't get me wrong, it's real nice just not the best i've smelled with this type of ale. 
T: Taste is crisp and sour rounded out with some sweet grape and citrus that finishes dry. There's also hints of sourdough and funky yeast that add a whole dimension to the flavor - really quite an amazing ale.

Smells sour of course with a touch of muskiness and a light fruity citrus tang. 
Taste is very pleasant, refreshing and crisp for a sour. Decent lip puckering mixed with a clean texture and delicate floral subtleties that produce a not too complex but delicate wild. 
Mouthfeel is smoother than expected, not quite thick but somewhat dense. Oaky dry and fun to drink with nice carbonation. No alcohol heat. Excellent.
Drinkability is confusing on this one! Its so easy to drink with the abv so well hidden, and with such a refreshing taste. A solid wild. 667 charactersptykozoon, Sep 04, 2010

Lots of sour grapes and apples. Light malty funk. Hints of vinegar.
This was quite sour, lots of grape and lemon with hints of apple. The oak was light but carried through out. The funk was well overpowered by the sourness.
Lots of carbonation, very tingly. A bit dry in the finish.
This was different than the bottle. More amplified and fruit flavored. Granted, could be that they were different batches. Either way, delicious and I bought a bottle to go, so yeah... Drinkable! 578 charactershooliganlife, Aug 16, 2010

S: Sour grapes, brett, wine barrel.
T: Can really taste the chardonnay here, crisp and dry. One dimensional in its sourness. Impression of lemon and perhaps some other ripe fruits, but never fully materializes. Brett funk adds some zing.
M/D: Big carbonation keeps tart and sour flavors "popping", lively on the palate. Straight forward, easy drinker as far as sours go. 445 characterszoolzoo, Aug 16, 2010

T: Much of the same... Lemony, hay pepper, salted sour fruit - lemon mostly. 
M + D: The very carbonated and dry feel are an odd combination. A tad syrupy, but not... and then crisp and sparkling. A little odd, but interesting, as well. Not one of my favourite RR brews, but quite good, nonetheless. 429 charactersProteus93, Aug 14, 2010

T: the vinous barrel funk charaters are more potent on the palate with wine, slight vinegar, and acidic citrus accents. You could taste a little brett notes as well.
M: the brew was medium body with a good amount of tingly carbonation that had a slight sweet, sour, and dry finish.
D: I love my sours and this one is no exception but isn't the greatest I've ever had but it still drank very good and had me feining for more after ever sip; great brew. 718 charactersGobzilla, Aug 12, 2010

A- Pours a hazy, golden yellow color. A fingers worth of white foamy head. TONS of bubbles. Some sudsy lacing left behind.
A- Smells of chardonnay, white grapes, oak, and lemon. Some funk is in play. Doesn't particularly smell "sour" like the other sours we cracked.
T- Starts off a lot more sweeter than I was expecting. The sweet chardonnay characteristics come into play right away. There is a strong oak presence that brings a tame tartness into play. The funk is light and not to extreme. There is a bit of lemon and green granny smith apples that helps with the tartness.
M- Light bodied with intense carbonation. A crisp dry finish.
D- Very nice...a little tame for me. Definitely not of the mouth puckering variety. 791 charactersurwithdave, Aug 05, 2010
4.43/5  rDev +0.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Batch 3. Thanks psprings!
Poured into a Hill Farmstead tasting glass. A big, fluffy, white head sits on top of a clear, golden-yellow body. Sudsy lacing down the glass. Lots of bubbling beneath the head. Looks beautiful!
Light barnyard funk and white wine grapes on the nose. Oak barrels come through nicely. Light citrus and a bit of earthy brett. Some sweet malts.
Sour white grapes and tart green apples on the tongue. The brett has really come through and given the flavor a nice dry and tart presence. Sweet malts linger in the background. The lacto is coming through nicely as well, giving off some good sourness, but brett is still the most dominant. Overall, lots of green apple and white grape pulled together nicely with brett.
Mouthfeel is crisp, with a good amount of sour/tartness. Fairly smooth with spritzy carbonation and slight alcohol warmth. Quite dry, especially on the finish. The brett has done nice things to this beer. Less foamy in the mouthfeel than other Russian River wilds. Could be due to the age. I like it.
Drinkability is good. This is definitely a tasty wild. Age has treated the bottle quite well. I'm really enjoying the increased sourness and dryness. With some age though, this beer is a bit more of a sipper, but still an enjoyable one. A 375 ml bottle is the perfect serving. I should really pick up a few batch 4 Temptations to age. Highly recommended!
Update: Just had some Batch 5 Temptation. Great stuff. Fruity with light sourness, lots of white grape. However, I think this beer really shines with about 2 years of age on it. Definitely pick some up to cellar. 1,612 characterssisuspeed, Jul 27, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750mL bottle - batch 004x4 - served into a tulip glass
Pours a very pale yellow. It is hazy from yeast but there is little visible yeast sediment. The haze makes for a beer that glows when held to light, but at the same time there is some small amount of translucency. A tightly constructed finger and a half of small, very white bubbles sits on top, providing nice lacing.
Temptation's aromas seem to be less intense than those of the Consecration that I enjoyed last night. However, this beer is no less complex. The funk is a lot stronger here than in Consecration. A nice, even-keel hay-and-horseblanket set of Brettonamyces aromas is much welcomed. Some light tartness that comes across as lemon and nectarine. Fleeting whisps of flowers. Some astringency for balance comes from the Chardonnay barrels and from some medicinal phenols. Everything works together beautifully. If you've had enough lambics, guezues or wild ales then you won't find anything that will surprise you. But then not everything has to surprise.
Sweet & tart peach, nectarine and lemon flavors jump out right from the first sip. That tartness fades fast, leading to a slightly sugary malt taste. The beer's complexity unfolds over the next many sips. Funky sweat, musty leather and dried hay make for a deliciously funky counterpart to the sour fruits. There is a combination of phenolic flavors and especially oak barrel that I recognize from last night's bottle of Consecration (perhaps this is a signature taste among Russian River's wild ales?). The beer finishes very dry and funky; a positive thing given the nature of the flavors here. 
Superb mouthfeel. It is light in body with carbonation that is perfect in both its amount and intensity to the tongue. I couldn't imagine the mouthfeel being any better for the flavors that this beer delivers. Temptation's drinkability is simply tremendous. It is light enough in alcohol (7.25 % ABV) to be able to drink a whole bottle carefree. The drying finish and overall subtlety and balance make for a beer that you will drink and drink and crave for more.
Scythe beer! I love you, Scythe Beer; you are my new friend. This is a great beer. Great beer. Oh, to have the disposable income to buy a case of this. Totally worth the retail price. Totally worthy of adoration. 2,302 charactersReaper16, Jul 23, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Really glad to try this one from a bottle. It's definitely better than on tap. It might be my favorite beer.
Nice looking in the glass, with a pale golden tint and slight haze, depending on which pour. Yeastier down at the bottom of the bottle. Crisp head that faded to good lacing and a film.
Stupendous aroma of top flight white wine. Excellent tartness in there.
Depth of flavor that surpasses all but the best of the best. A very unique wine-like taste that begins sour but mellows into a complexity that I wish white wine had. I would substitute this for white wine with a meal every time.
Surprisingly great mouthfeel. Good carbonation, and the sourness never builds. Very drinkable and refreshing. 708 charactersChizoad, Jul 22, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Healthy two finger head of bleached bone white, tiny microfoam throughout, credible retention and more thicker streaks of lacing than expected. Metallic orange rust color, also clearer than expected, strong bubble storm inside the glass, few actual beads. Raw yeasts and super-sour white grapefruit to lemon citrus set the tone in the nose, matted wet straw, old kindling wood ashes, charcoal, then angular green apple, green grape and pear scents, white pepper and caraway seeds, Full-bodied, in large part due to the carbonation foam which feels like someone emptied a fire extinguisher in your mouth, expands to near dripping out of your mouth. Sour, yet would be much more so were it not for that carbonation, keen edge to the lemon, white grapefruit citrus. However, here more vanillin oak comes through to at least momentarily soften things. Does not have the funk of the nose but no sense trying to avoid the earthen straw, mud and animal hide notes. Boozy, even with the relatively low alcohol percentage, pear, pineapple, white grape, apple citrus, were it a wine it would likely need malolactic fermentation. Violets, anise and more caraway, at times recalls dried Indian spices. Its tight grip on your palate extends the finish texturally way past the flavors. Interesting but I'll be the first to admit that wild ales are not my faves. (Batch 004X2) 1,361 charactersfarrago, Jul 10, 2010

Pours gold with a slight amount of haze. There is a lot of carbonation coming up from the bottom. The head is brilliant white, and three fingers high with very nice retention and lacing.
The aroma has sour/tart Brett, barnyard funk, lemon, and green apple. Very nice tart aroma, which should have a nice flavor to it as well. Wow, the flavor on this one is nice. The tartness, the barnyard funk, lemons, and green apple all come through. 
Tart, dry, nicely carbonated, and light bodied. In many ways this reminds me of a dry, white wine. Nice drinkability. 572 charactershardy008, Jul 07, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5On tap at the RR brewpub. I've had this out of bottles before, but this review is based on a sample in the brewpub.
A - Slightly hazy golden yellow color with orange highlights, with a slight head that actually stuck around for a long time. Plenty of lacing down the glass. Impressed with how nice this one looks. 
S - Perusing reviews on this site, I've always wondered about the barnyard descriptor -- until now. This beer definitely makes me understand it. Funky barnyard is in your face, followed by some chardonnay notes. Citrus sourness, and some sweetness comes in the back. Just a hint of the barrel.
T - Lemony citrus notes, plus that funkiness. Lots of flavor from the wine barrels. The woman sitting next to me (a wine not beer drinker) called it -- she said it tastes most like a dry white wine, and she's right. The finish was dry like the wine, but had a ton of the sour character common to RR's belgian line. Absolutely delicious.
M - Effervescent like a nice champagne, but very silky at the same time, if that's possible. Lots of bubbles but small ones. Dry finish.
D - On the one hand, the sourness will tend to get to you (I seem to always be obligated to mention this with sours). On the other, it's subtle enough with this one, and the beer just tastes so damned good, that you just want to keep reaching for more. 
O - This is probably my favorite from RR, at least of their sours. The only thing keeping me from buying it all the time is the price (and the availability, it's not easy to find outside the brewery). 1,543 charactersdjmichaelk, Jul 05, 2010

Nice funky barnyard notes here, also some woody notes from the barrel aging. Quite a nice smell, I can already tell this beer is going to be tasty.
Barnyard funkiness, Belgian yeastiness, brett, earthy notes, and light malt all parade on the palate. Very nice tasting beer, one of my favorite sours from Russian River.
Very nicely carbonated, nice sour dry finish.

Bomber poured into Bruery tulip. Batch 004x3
A- Pours a nice golden with a good amount of haze due to getting the last pour out of the bottle. A half finger worth of head that recedes quickly but leaves spotty lacing.
S- A fairly decent amount of grapes, mainly green grapes. A little bit of funk and what seems like champagne yeast or sparkling wine. Some oak rounds out the nose.
T- A nice bit of oak, more present than in the nose. Some nice sourness and funk. I pick up hints of vanilla on the back end and just a touch of yeast.
M- Medium to light bodied. This one is a nice puckering sour. A great amount of carbonation that tickles the tongue as well. This brew, although sour, feels creamy on the tail end.
D- A very good beer that isn't overly sour and has really good balance. Another winner from RR. 851 charactersWisconsinality, Jul 01, 2010

3.8/5  rDev -13.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3750ml bomber
Appearance: Pour is orange-apricot with great belgian head and lacing.
Smell: Full of bitter barnyard funk and must, chardonnay oak (more like a cheap chardonnay than a good one) and ripe golden fruit. I think it might have almost spent too long in barrels.
Taste: Bitter barnyard funk (with a cat piss element to it), chardonnay oak, and ripe fruits like apricots, pears, peaches, and apples. There is a bitterness to it that doesn't quite fit in. Just a bit too much oak. Actually I find more oak in the bottle than the on-tap version, along with more of a funkiness.
Mouthfeel: Not in love with the carbonation or coating aspect, but good
Drinkability: Drinkable enough but I am not crazy about this one; I admire Vinnie as a pioneer of this style in America but he just never caught up with the Europeans and has now been surpassed by several americans. The first doesn't always go the farthest, even though he sets the path. 947 characterscraytonic, Jun 19, 2010
4.48/5  rDev +1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Well holy crap my first rr. 750ml huge thanks to G311!!! Bottle pours hazy golden yellow with crisp white head, leaves lovely amount of lacing, actually crazy lacing, around the glass. Aroma of hay, grass, very light funk, pinapple. Very small amount of oak comes through with white wine. Taste of tropical fruit, white n green grapes, such an amazing balance of flavors! The chardonay oak is apparent, first time I've had a beer aged in a white wine barrel pulled off so well. The beer is tart and sour, but not as bracingly sour as I had expected. I imagine this is due to the quality and age of the barrels aged in imparting a smoother quality then more raw oak. This beer straight up fills your mouth with flavor on all sides. I could drink this everyday, I'm ruined. 771 characterspmlondrigan, Jun 19, 2010

A - Totally clear golden yellow with a dense white head, there is good retention and lace that covers the glass with thick fingers. It's very attractive.
S - Lemony golden citrus and floral hops with a massive, delicious funk! Light horse blanket and musty wheat has a great combination with a nice light sour finish. Mmm, Brett.
T - Thinner than expected, a bit of the lemon citrus comes through but the majority of the flavor is heavily wild ale with a thin horse blanket and nice barn yard funk to it.
M - Temptation is light-bodied with a funky sour finish that's right up my alley. Nice tart finish with a great clean and crisp texture to it.
D - Definitely a bottle worth sharing with people but probably not worth the $25 price tag. Very good beer with a nice wild kick to the finish. 921 charactersBeerFMAndy, Jun 17, 2010

Split and poured into my tulip the beer is hazy golden yellow with about a finger of white head. A thin lace ring is left around the glass after settling.
The aroma is a rich boquet of spices and yeast. A good dose of sour grapes and apples mix with plenty of funk and barrel wood. Spot on wild ale.
The flavor is pretty much a mirror of the nose. Lots of tart fruit with loads of funky wood and straw. I've never tasted a horse blanket but I'm going to assume this is what one might resemble. 
Medium bodied and not as dry as I had assumed it would be. Plenty of carbonation.
Overall another winner from RR. Wild ales are starting to become my favorite style. I could easily polish off the whole bottle myself. 805 charactersbeerwolf77, Jun 17, 2010

Pours beautiful golden orange, nice white head and lacing that's not going anywhere. It is..dare I say it..tempting?
Smell is pretty much that average sour, funky scent you'd expect from a beer like this. Chardonnay and funk, a simple yet excellent smell.
...and a simple yet excellent taste as well. Sour chardonnay, funk, lemon. Oak and vanilla are present mostly in the aftertaste. Not as complex as Supplication, but simple and great in it's own right.
Mouthfeel is pretty spot-on for the style. Well-carbonated, no problems here.
Very drinkable, big price tag on this but I'd say it's deserved.
**more notes - 7/25/11**
Just finished a 375ml (Batch 5x2E), a little over a year old in the bottle. Great stuff! I think I liked it even better than the first batch I tried. Similar to a gueuze, had a great funky, farmy chardonnay vibe, extremely drinkable. I have one more bottle of this batch left and can't wait to try it around the 3-year old mark.
**7/15/13**
Just over 3 years in the bottle. Once again, great experience. Still great flavor and carbonation, maybe a bit tamer overall but very tasty and drinkable. This along with Consecration and Supplication all held up great after 3 years. 1,332 charactersChico1985, Jun 16, 2010

(A)- Pours a clear brilliant yellow color that produced a good pure white head that stuck around for a bit before dissipating. Left some lacing behind. 
(S)- Funktastic! A dry oak spiciness with a light yet present fruitiness of lemon and apricot with maybe even a tiny bit of a peach/green apple thing. Seriously dry with a big hay/straw/grassy funk.
(T)- Pretty much just what the smell foretold. Tart and sour yet actually a little sweet fruits of lemon, apricot, and maybe even some banana in there. Super dry hay and straw funk with a light oaky spice. Definitely can detect the Chardonnay barrels in this.
(M)- A lively carbonation level that creates a party in the mouth. A good balance of sour yet sweet characteristics with a great dry funk typical of the style. 
(D)- A great wild ale. Very Chardonnay-like in the background from the barrel aging. Great tartness and dryness. Funkier than I was expecting, but it was a welcomed surprise. Russian River knows their wilds! 1,101 characterssweemzander, Jun 14, 2010

A- Glorious golden yellow with a foamy white cap that has good retention for an aged beer. A nice cloud stays afloat and leaves a coat of lace and very sticky suds. One of the best looking sours I have seen.
S- Nothing stands out alone here but a nice balance. Grape and wine/vinous notes are probably the most forefront but there is some fruit and you can tell it will be sour. Slight funk from a simple, yet well balanced aroma.
T- Microbes had a party in this one, blonde ale turned very good. Sour vinous notes up front with some lemon acidity and fruit notes. Sour is great at a moderate-high level. A bit of funk but an overall balanced taste with nothing aggressive or overpowering. Some oak as well as acetic notes towards the end.
MF- Light but nicely creamy body with moderate carbonation. A coat of sour white wine vine on the palate. Great sour feeling on the tongue.
DB- Amazing balance of simple and complex flavors, nothing takes center stage and all of the taste can be appreciated. Reminds me of a gueuze a bit. Awesome vinous wine elements here as well. Gotta trade for it around here but like Supplication, it is totally worth it. 1,272 characterscbutova, Jun 11, 2010

A really special beer, not as sour as cantillon but still packed with flavor. A sessionable wild ale if it wasn't so expensive. The wine character didn't come through as much as i expected. Still a great beer, loved it. 547 charactersbum732, Jun 01, 2010

Pours a nice light golden yellow, a bit of haze gives this beer a glowing appearance as the sunlight comes through the beer...three fingers of soft, fluffy white head forms and lasts forever, after slowly receding, a thin layer of white film caps the brew, lacing is left all down the glass...
Initial smell of tart, sour fruit quickly gives way to a strong brett aroma, musty with definite barnyard funk. Tart and wine-like, chardonnay with a bit of the oak showing up as well...very complex, very inviting, very nice...
Tart, sour lemon acidity right from the get go, smooth and juice-like. Beer quickly becomes dry, flavors of oak and brett really start to come out giving this beer a whole different taste and feel than what was experienced initially. Becomes musty and grassy, an earthy dry feel takes hold on the bottom half of the glass...Incredibly complex but balanced, tart but smooth, puckering but insanely easy to drink...
Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Yet while being spritzy and tingly on the tongue, the beer still maintains a smooth feel. Some little scrubbing bubbles agitate the tongue and add to the dry finish...Only knock is that it may have a bit too much carbonation for me, as I have been constantly burping while writing this review...
Loved this beer, wish I could have it more often, but with the price and complete unavailability to me in Chicago, this one will remain a special treat when/if I try it again... 1,545 charactershawks10, May 25, 2010

I hope this beer isn't flat due to the bad publicity r&r has gotten. A sigh of relief, the beautiful pop of a cork. Poured into a tulip glass at 46 degrees.
The Appearance: A two finger foamy, creamy, bubbly white head. The head has moderate to great retention. The head leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is a medium straw color with golden orange hues. The clarity of the beer is hazy. There is a lot of carbonation bubbles in the beer.
Nose:AH, (the Brett) a very pungent, bright aroma.The rich flavors of chardonnay, oak, orange, barnyard, lemon, butter, grapefruit, moldy straw, toasty, vanilla, morning dew, yeasty with a subtle sugary sweetness at the end. 
Taste: The Brett and the chardonnay are the initial flavor on the first sip. The flavors are morning dew, moldy hay, and some light barnyard notes. The chardonnay has notes of butter, vanilla, oak, lemon, grass, and a subtle sweetness. Other flavors in the beer is orange, grapefruit, floral, a sour note, and yeast. The malt is slightly toasty. 
The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated, subtle sourness, and clean. 
Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. I am so surprised by this beer and how it taste. The Brett isn't overpowering, but plays equals roles in beer. I am just wowed by how amazing the flavors are, crisp, and very easy to drink. I am very glad that this was my 600th review. 1,503 characterscolts9016, May 23, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I poured this one from a 750ml brown bottle (corked and caged) into a stemmed tulip glass.
A= This ale poured a mostly clear gold color with some orange highlights. Big foamy white head that was hard to keep under control while pouring (2+ inches). Effervescent carbonation put on a show. Good head retention. 
S= Lots of funky sourness, must be some brett and a host of other wild bugs in this one. Occasionally a whif of malt came through as well as a winey fruit character.
T= Started off tart and just got more intense. Sort of a blend of cherry, oak, citrus, and musty funk that sounds strange but really worked. Less complexity than some other RR sours I have had, but tasty all the same. Finished puckeringly dry with a kiss of alcohol.
MF= Lighter side of medium bodied with a spritzy, effervescent feel.
D= A masterpiece of sourness and dryness - very refreshing. Kept me wanting that next sip until it was all gone. 930 charactersspointon, May 18, 2010
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Downtown Johnny Brown's in San Diego.
Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a one-finger white head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells of tart light fruits - pears mostly but with hints of apricots - along with solid amounts of funky aromas. As the beer warms very mild amounts of indistinct spices waft out.
Tastes similar to how it smells. Light fruit flavors - pears and apricots as with the aroma - kick things off that are equal parts sweet and tart. Soon afterward good amounts of funk permeate through the flavor profile and the flavors take a sour turn. Midway through the sip hints of spices temper the tartness and carry through to a crisp ending.
Mouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with moderate carbonation.
Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could have a few more without any problems.
Overall I enjoyed this very much however I have to say it's my least favorite RR sour (the others I've had are Supplication and Consecration). Very well balanced and a lighter sour that would bring people into the fold nicely. 1,116 charactersglid02, May 14, 2010
4.48/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at the brewpub. Wish I could have purchased a bomber to bring home but $25 was a little pricey. $6.75 on tap however is much more doable.
Bright, golden yellow with a small white head. Smells very citrusy, especially lemon, some oak, white wine and a little funky yeastiness. Tastes very unique. I don't think I've ever wanted to describe a beer that spent any time being barrel aged as bright, crisp, or refreshing but all of those seem to fit here. Taste is predominantly sour citrusy fruits, with subtle white wine, oak, yeast and funk. Well carbonated lively mouthfeel. Incredibly drinkable, very agreeable stuff. Its complexity probably means it should be sipper but I found myself taking large gulps and drinking it pretty quickly. Good thing after stopping at Russian River for lunch my girlfriend could take over driving duties for our road trip as I sober back up and review from my notes on my blackberry. 923 charactersShumista, May 12, 2010

A - Golden, hazy with a tint of brown. When first poured into the glass a nice white head formed which left lacing down the glass....tons of carbonation streaming upwards...looking at it, it looks champagne with but darker. 
S- strong scent of sour cherries, oak, lemon, definitely some farmhouse funk
T - At first, there is oak, chardonnay and a bit of the brett that first hits. Next where there more sour flavors which included lemon, and cherry. The finish was tart and rested on the tongue for a while
MF - Nice carbonation to this that brings a tingle to the mouth that really fits well with the tart flavors within
D - This is one of those beers that challenges what a beer is. I could imagine taking it to a party and having people believe it was some sort of off champagne. Russian River does a great job with sours and this is a fine example. Very easy to drink and could pairing well with cheeses. 923 charactersjeonseh, May 03, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the brewery. Brought to the table with a small white foamy head sitting on top of a straw golden colored ale. Major lacing for lacing fans. The aroma is amazing! Floral (major rose), banana, pear, bubble gum and funk. A lot going on and it's all good! The taste has a sour barnyard funk with a spicy kick on the swallow. Not as sour as I thought it would be which makes it even more enjoyable. Awesome stuff. Nicely carbonated and a high drinkability though the sourness makes this a sipper. Overall I was very impressed with this drink. It has all the necessary characteristics needed for an unforgettable sour ale. 626 characterskaseydad, May 02, 2010

a - Pours a murky golden color with two fingers of white head. Nice lacing and light carbonation.
s - Smells of wine, sour fruits including lemon, and some tart and funk from the brett. The chardonnay really comes through, as does smoe oak.
t - Taste again is sour fruit, chardonnay, and some funk. Oak is more prominent in the taste than it was in the smell.
m - Light body and high carbonation. Very crisp.
d - Pretty good. I thought the wine came through a little too much but it was still a very good wild ale from RR. Would try again. 612 charactersmdfb79, Apr 29, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Draft at Rose & Crown, batch 004. Into a 10 oz snifter, Temptation is a bright golden color, pale and clear, with a rapidly receding white cap.
Lemony lactic sourness and tart Chardonnay dominate the aroma. There's ample barnyard funk behind it, which comes out more as the temperature rises.
The barrel comes through strongly in the taste, lending a big buttery Chardonnay character. Lactic and mild acetic sourness come through with equal strength. Tart white grape, vanilla, tannic oak and spice provide depth. Intensely flavorful but light-bodied, this is almost sessionable. It finishes with drying tannins, buttery oak and white grape. Very enjoyable, but I prefer the previous two batches over this one. 712 characterslargadeer, Apr 28, 2010
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a bright golden amber with massive, champagne like visible carbonation and a medium sized fizzy head. 
The smell is light and very non offensive. Very fruity on the nose, sour passion fruit, freshly cut lemongrass and an airy vibrant funk. Strong vinous chard notes as well.
The taste is much more reserved than I expected. Light vinegary lemon juice inoculated with mild brett flavors. Very vinous and almost cider-like. The oak is not showcased, but rather melds with the acidity to remove any heavier vinegar notes. Tangy, under ripe pear and lactic on the finish with no heat or alcohol flavors at all. Simple yet complex flavors work amazingly together.
The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and the insane level of carbonation makes me feel like this brew could float right out of my glass.
Overall, it took a major event in my life to succumb to temptation. I was not let down. Another amazing beer from a brewery that never ceases to amaze me. 960 charactersBDLbrewster, Apr 26, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this up at Bottle Barn in Santa Rosa, just a few days ago, and felt it was time to make my first review. As with all the RR pint bottled beers it definitely has the crisp smell I've grown accustomed to. From the bottle it smells faintly of not yet ripe green apples, and then once it my glass you can really get that full orchard in the rain kinda smell. Very nice to see the constant stream of bubbles and well as the 1/3 inch of foam that never really goes away. At first taste it did remind me of RR's darker Consecration, which is one of my favorites. I can really taste the granny smith pearesc kinda taste. I do taste a little chardonnay as well. I am very happy to live in the same town as this brewery as I have spent many a night drinking the varieties they offer and this one will be purchased again for sure. 826 charactersRadiapathy, Apr 23, 2010

A: Golden orange, it poured with a huge puffy cream head that slowly died to a good film with constant bubbles running up the glass.
S: Rustic funk (brett.), very sour apples, yeasty bread, French Oaked chardonnay alcohol. Simply pleasant.
T: Very sour, puckery tart, bright green apples. Chardonnay and pears come through. It almost comes off as a dry cider.
M: Frothy, thin, but very spritzy and crisp, while almost creamy.
D: Awesome. I could finish the whole bottle myself. 572 charactersne0m00re, Apr 15, 2010

S- Smells of a downpour at the race tract, wet hay stuck to the bottom of shoes. Then mixed with a crisp green apple drizzled in lavender honey.
T- It tastes like a bosc pear picked off the tree way to early, my hunger over comes me and I must take a bite of this pear, sharp and green. Aerating it in my mouth into a foam of green grapes. So refreshing...
M-Creamy farm butter store in an oak barrel at first, and then my sour taste buds in my mouth are screaming out for more. I gave in, you would have too.
D-I would have this every day if I could only find a lifetime supply. Shared with oglmcdgl and paired with a classic salad, with a pickled red onion vinaigrette. 858 charactersSourBatchKid, Apr 14, 2010

S: Sour white grapes, apple juice, brett/funk, and hints of Belgian yeast. Smells like fruity champagne!
T: Dry white wine, sour white grapes, and oaked earthiness. A good balance of sweet, sour, and woodiness. 
M: A crisp light body with a very dry finish akin to white wine. 
D: Good balance; a fine sipper to appreciate. Another well done Wild Ale from Russian River. 538 charactersMrDanno96, Apr 13, 2010
4.08/5  rDev -7.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Extremely generous extra, thanks to dbuckingham
Pours a glowing golden yellow with a mountain of fluffy head and thick lacing. The etchings in the bottom of my Duvel tulip cause a constant rising of bubbles keep the head persistent and thick.
The aroma starts out dominated by tart white grapes and red delicious apples. There is a very faint oakiness in the background, as well as some light cobwebby funky.
I notice that the oak has imparted itself in the flavor much more than the aroma. This is bone suckingly dry and tart. Light, musty, fruity, dry....those are my initial impressions. Digging deeper, there doesn't seem to be much more in terms of depth and complexity. Thats not necessarily a huge fault, since what is here is definitely tasty.
The body is medium to light, carbonation is heavy but appropriate, and finish is dry and musty. I was surprised to see the 7.25 ABV on this one, I thought it would be down in the 5% range.
Overall, this is not necessarily one of my favorite American Wild Ale or sours, but it still is quite a remarkable beer and definitely is worthy of praise. 1,101 charactersalcstradamus, Apr 10, 2010

This is very aromatic. I love the smell of Brett and it's very discernible. Lemon and apple show up as well. It has classic chardonnay notes along the way (oak, crisp white fruit.)
Great complex taste. Again, the Brett is very present and funky, playing tug of war with strong lemon. It's very tart and sour. The finish is light oak. 
Mouthfeel is mouth puckering sour, crisp, and fresh. There is a long lasting funky aftertaste. 
Despite the punishing sourness, I had no problem drinking the bottle. It was entertaining from start to finish. 639 charactersVonerichs, Apr 10, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Pours with two and a half fingers of fluffy, white foam on top of a golden body with perfect clarity. The rocky head settles slowly and leaves nice, thick curtains of lace on the glass.
S - Musty wild yeast aromas backed by moderate levels of smooth, lactic acid. Juicy fruit notes of pineapple, and cherry that work well with the acidity.
T - Pungent, fruity acidity up front with notes of sharp pineapple and a bit of mango. Some sugary malt appears in the middle with a bit of musty, wild yeast character. Finishes with more sharp, fruity sourness and a light herbal hop flavor and bitterness. The fruit lingers on the palate in the aftertaste along with vanilla notes and light funk.
M - Medium-thick body, very high carbonation, and a slightly sweet finish.
D - Very nice, this beer combines balance and complexity in a way that one rarely sees in this sort of beer. There is a great deal of fruit from the yeast as well as a strong acidity in the flavor that compliments the fruit and brings out a greater depth of fruit character than I have ever experienced in a beer that doesn't actually have any fruit in it. This acidity is very well balanced by a thick backbone of sweet malt and a finish that is not quite as dry as I would normally expect in a belgian style beer of this strength. It is surprisingly drinkable, both for a wild ale and a beer with this alcohol content. My only complaint is that I don't have much hope of getting another bottle of this beer any time soon. 1,494 charactersnickfl, Apr 06, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle split with friends, thanks mlaroche!
Pours a golden color with a fizzy white head, fades fast with little to no lacing.
Smell is lightly funky and sour, definitely picking up a bit of a chardonnay/white wine vibe from the aroma which is a nice change up from most beers.
Taste is light and crisp, the sour/funk isn't beat you over the head but merely tinges the tongue, carbonation is on the high side but works well for this, finishes dry, a beer that also seems complex but is quite clean in its presence.
On the lighter side of sours/funks and would actually be a good bridge for wine enthusiasts trying to get into craft beer. 641 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Apr 03, 2010

 Aroma is lemony sour chardonay with a very slight wet hay.
 Taste is pucker sour, lemon rind, biting on the tip of the tongue then some oaky sweetness in the middle followed by a clean lemony aftertaste that is more juicy than dry
 Carbonation is on the high side in a good way, refreshing and complex.
 I can drink this a lot. Bravo! 472 charactersmudbug, Apr 02, 2010

4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this on tap at Toronado during SF Beer week.
Temptation by RR is a blonde Ale aged in French oak chardonnay barrels with Brettanomyces and it's 7.25% abv.
 The Temptation 08 poured a clear deep marigold with a creamy white head. The 08 is a shade darker than the 09. The 08 had an incredible nose- chardonnay grapes, oak, fresh green grape juice. It tasted of fresh grapes, lemon peel, oak, chardonnay with a hint of honey. A very pretty beer. The 09 did not have a strong aroma compared to the 08. I had to smell it hard just to get some oak notes out of it. It tasted of citrus, pink grapefruit, honey, and a sour dry finish. It was good, but I hands down enjoyed the 08 better. It was almost like a completely different beer. Get your hands on some if you can. 769 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010

Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Belgian Goblet. The color on this beer is wonderful, a crystal clear golden blond that foams up nicely and leaves a fair amount of lacing. Aroma is absolutely divine. Sour tangy notes from the wild yeast which make Temptation a world class beer float out of the glass and could likely be picked up from across the room. Truly wonderful. Balancing the amount of sour bite that this beer packs with all of the other elements here is a remarkable feat, and Russian River continues to impress. It's smooth and refreshing, while at the same time aggressive and tangy. I absolutely love this beer and would recommend that fellow BAs do what is necessary to get their hands on it. 823 charactersIrieJackalope, Mar 21, 2010

A: Beautiful golden hue with very little haze. Head is thick and white, and retains nicely. lacing is sticky and concentrated.
S: Hops are almost non-existent on the nose, but the rest makes up for that. Citrus, white grape, and some grass show, along with some barnyard and just a hint of oak.
T: Flavors of this beer consist of citrus and white grape, along with grassy, herbal notes. Brett adds just the right amount of funk to it. The oak has mellowed this beer greatly, with just a tinge in the backround. The finish is dry, and very clean.
M&D: Medium bodied and very soft. While it is somewhat puckering, the beer is very thirst-quenching.Temptation is amazing stuff! Easy to drink, and very complex at the same time. It's a beer that I'll be searching for again in the new future. 901 charactersWYVYRN527, Mar 15, 2010

Poured into a DFH tulip, formed a 1 1/4" bright white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head continues to grow for awhile, snowconing above the rim, with thick coating lace. Aroma is tart with a touch of funk. Taste is tart from the moment it hits the tongue, coupled with some barnyard and sweetness throughout. Mouthfeel is smooth over the tongue, and drinkability is very good. Not as calm as my last one, but still a great sensory experience.

Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2" bright white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head recedes sedately, with sticky lacing. Aroma is tart with a bit of funkiness rounding things out. Taste is surprisingly sweet to start, goes moderately tart in the middle, and hits a few more interesting flavors near the close, with the funk and barrel character. Mouthfeel is smooth esp for a wild brew, and drinkability is easy and refreshing. Moderated tartness at this point makes it almost a starter to the wild side.

Taste follows, delicate sweetness upfront, powerful tart in the middle, but with a strong oak and alcohol character at the close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are quite pleasing. Always an adventure, and I like these type of rides. 1,857 charactersppoitras, Mar 03, 2010

Look: Bright golden color, slightly cloudy, thin head, and little lacing
Smell: Oak, vanilla, brett funk, lemon zest
Taste: Up Front: Lemon zest, white grape, malt. Finish: brett funk, oak at the end
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a light/medium carbonation. Like Consecration, it got creamier as it warmed up.
Drinkability: Incredibly smooth, crisp, and refreshing!
Overall Impression: This was a fantastic and complex ale. You could definitely pick up the aging in Chardonnay casks. Again, the brett was not over-the-top, but rather a compliment to its overall complexity. Methinks Russian River has this Wild Ale thing down! Regarding Newbeez: I think this would appeal to ladies more than dudes, due to its sophisticated wine-like qualities. 769 charactersBeerGodz, Mar 02, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On-Tap at Monk's Cafe in a tulip glass. I've had this beer on draft several times now, I believe this is Batch 4.
Temptation holds a bright blonde golden look that's appealing, it sucks you in. Off the spicket a nice semi froth of white snow graces the top then fades. Not much lace at all from this.
Smells of California wine barrel Oak, barnyard scents from round back, a light fruitness and some brett. Lemon spritz, under that a blond ale in disguise but some faint malt. Lighter in funk on the nose with this batch.
The extreme sourness is not haywire like batch 3 (which I loved). It's there but muted at this young stage. It brings out the oak more with chardonnay plus light brett with horse blankets on. The wine influence is lovely. A small hit of fruit in the middle with minor tropic flavors followed by pale malt and light funk on the tounge.
Some funk, some sour, some acididy, lighter in this batch making it a bit more drinkable and approachable. Light to medium in texture and a spritzy carb going for it. While this is heavily wine influenced this felt like beer to me with a wine aftertaste. Easy to gulp down. While I enjoy the more funked up versions this is nice and mellow in it's youth. 1,214 charactersBARFLYB, Mar 02, 2010

Batch 5-fair bit of hops, juicy, hints of soap with notes of leathery brett up front. som dry oak, dustry, very light chardonney wine flavor. juicy dry oak, bright white grapes and slightly sour with a fairbit of grassy hops and some juicy citrus.
Batch 4-more sublte than 5, chardonney comes out slightly more and the hops are much more mild. flavors of integrated oak, white grapes, light brett presence and faint hops.
Batch 3-the hops have faded but the flavors are soft well integrated and subtle. the chardonney barrels really make a bright presence, juicy white grapes as the brett comes in behind. the brett is slightly sharp but still leans towards subtlty with some lemon and soft peach flavors in the back.
Batch 1-the brett has started to dominate and take over, the chardonney and juicy wine flavors have become much light and the sweetness now resides behind and underneath the strong brett presence.

A-pours a pale golden yellow color with a thin bubbly head, 2-3 full fingers, holding strongly to the side of the glass.
S-nice notes of oak and hints of vanilla start off this funky aroma. Wild yeasts take over giving it a fair amount of funk, sour grapes and green apples, notes of lemon zest and grass at the finish

M-this is extremely smooth and crisp throught, sharp finish and very dry. medium body with a slight warming from the alcohol in the back with a lot of carbonation.
D-this is very sweet and tart. it brings huge flavors and an interesting taste from the barrel aging. Another intersting brew from RR. 1,784 characterscpetrone84, Mar 01, 2010

A- Nice hazy golden pale color with loads of nice fine head that left thin lacing on my glass. Tons of carbonation.
S- Barnyard funk, the brett stands up in the front of the line, followed by lemon and green apple scents, nice sour grape scents and subtle hints of sweet oak.
T- Immediate puckering from the green apple and citrus notes, noticing a good amount of brett, nice light bready yeast flavors and good dry oaky chardonnay finish. 
M- Light to medium body with a high amount of carbonation, carbonation was still present on the third day of tasting this beer. Very crisp and dry.
D- Easy drinking and leaves you wanting more, I enjoyed Supplication more because it had more flavor but this was very refreshing. 765 charactersSchmaltzy, Feb 27, 2010

Bottle opens with a pop and some nice gray wisps of smoke coming out of the neck. Pours into my tulip a light golden bronze hue with a generous amount of carbonation. Huge fluffy white head that has great hang time before turning into thin web like lacing on the glass.
Smell is a mixture of fruity and floral notes along with a slight vinegar sour aroma. Very nice. Can't quite put my nose on everything but definately an amazing smell.
Taste to me is absolutely perfect. Its crisp and dry and has fruity flavors of green apple. Also a very nice sourness upfront that is not mouth puckering. Tastes like a well balanced Champagne. Very vinous but definately the best sour ale I've ever had.
There is some nice body there and the amount of carbonation just makes for a very lively experience. I don't think it gets any better than this. Alcohol flavor is not present and this brew has alot of complexity while being balanced at the same time. My new favorite from Russian River. 995 characterssnpub540, Feb 22, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4GLASS: Unibroue Tulip
TEMP: Cellared @ approx 55 degrees
BATCH: 004x4 (Corked & Caged 750ml)
This pours a light, crisp, golden straw color, with a light orange tint. A fluffy head of off-white colored foam sits on top. Retention is very good. Lacing is in thin strands, but is fairly sticky.
I'm getting loads of white grapes and a good, healthy dose of barnyard funk, along with a slight twang of sourness. A nice presence of oakiness. Tons of citrus notes, especially lemon, along with under-ripe stone fruits. Mild hint of yeastiness.
This smells damn good.
Sour citrus notes and some medium level of barnyard funk are the dominant presence here. There is also a good deal of oak. Right around the middle of the taste you start getting a light hint of chardonnay grapes, which builds towards the end, giving you a nice, chard-like, dry finish.
This is medium-bodied with a light-to-medium level of carbonation. Not quite sharp, but very crisp and clean. Refreshing.
Not something that I'd want to drink everyday, but as an every now and then kind of beer, it would be great. Nicely smooth and easy to drink. 1,115 characterscoldmeat23, Feb 22, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The Temptation was poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into a large wine glass. It pours a beautiful bright golden yellow with a hefty white head that leaves a substantial amount lacing clinging joyfully all over the glass. Smells of brett, lemon, various citrus and funk, white wine and an oakiness - like that found in chardonnay. I don't even know how else to describe it. It is amazing. Best smelling beer I have had in quite some time. The taste is out of this world as well. It is fairly sour, but not overpowering. Very well balanced. This is how brett should treat a beer. The wine like qualities shine and the oak flavors add nice complexity. The mouth feel is medium and well carbonated. Again, this beer is so great because of its balance. Way too easy to drink and I am now wishing I had more in my glass. The alcohol is starting to show towards the end of the glass. An all around world class beer. 919 charactersmjn5036, Feb 19, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Undoubtedly one of the most well-balanced funky Belgians out there. Temptation is basically what brettanomyaces would do to Duvel. ...but there's more....
Temptation pours with a deep canary yellow color and medium haze (a bit more than I expected). A large stark-white head carries a combination of tight and loosely-knit bubbles. The ever lasting head laced all along the glass as though it didn't want to leave- ever.
The nose is a balanced blend of acidic lemon notes and funky-dusty-musty aromas. Crab apples and under-ripe berries come into play, but the beer takes on a typical aroma of well-played Belgian-brett beers.
Flavors are much more complex and less intense than what I got from the nose. True malt flavors of pilsner and wheat varieties shine up front and set the stage with timid sweetness and moderate bready notes. Those lemon, berry, and apple flavors come in close behind and in most tart and acidic fashion. Stopping shy of sour or vinegar, this beer shows great control and restraint. Spicy with white pepper notes from the phenolic yeast do a great job of not showing any off-notes. Still, the tartness weaves in and out of musty characters of basements or attics and light horse blanket just beyond mid palate and just in front of the finish. 
What is even more remarkable about the beer is how the wheat malts give a creamy, bready feel in the beginning but then the tartness nose-dives straight into a dry, acidic, and mildly warming finish. Again, shying away fron astringency, the tart acidity and moderate alcohols do all the work. The beer is fleeting and evaporative to the mouth, leaving a very clean aftertaste and leaving me begging for the next sip.
This is a masterpiece of a beer that has all the things that I love so much about Duvel but with added complexities and artfull assertion.
Thank you slayer3604! 1,853 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 19, 2010

The aroma is extremely sour smelling with sweet grape fruity flavors coming through. There is also a decent amount of a 'funk' coming through in the nose as well with a distinct alcohol smell. The flavor profile is insanely sour and sweet. My taste buds were enjoying this for sure. Again, much of the aroma came through in the taste with sweet fruits and a definite alcohol character. The finish was nicely dry and enjoyable. Very nice. 500 charactershophead247, Feb 15, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 003. Pours a cloudy deep gold with a full head comprised of finee bubbles resulting in moderate lace. Aromas of fruits such as grape and pineapple stick out along with a pleasant swirling of tart and sweet. The flavor is nicely sour and tart, acidic, with Chardonnay grape sweetness, touches of acetic acids, and a dry finish. Medium to light in body with a smooth, high carbonation. One of the classic American Wild Ales. Sour, smooth, funky, but easy to drink, fruity, and somewhat sweet. 496 charactersvacax, Feb 14, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Notes from tasting last night:
Bright golden color, 1/2 inch white head, somewhat lasting, nice lace. Aroma of light funk, leather, earthy, oak, and light white wine fruitiness. Taste is very tart and sour, notes of white grapes, lots of lemon and lasting dry finish. Yum yum! Mouthfeel is effervescent, but a few swrils of the tulip tones it down while also bringing out more aroma creating an overall more delightful beer in the process. This was great brew, ultra sour at first, but really becomes more developed as it warms. Good stuff, but I still haven't found a golden sour that can live up the greatness of Brute. This is a great beer though, and I thank SparklePants for sharing this one with me! 706 charactersKeefD, Feb 14, 2010
4.43/5  rDev +0.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Batch 004X1. Had before at a tasting, but never had a full bottle to myself....now I do. Cork comes loose with a good deal of coaxing, loud pop. Diagram on the cork basically forbids me to pour into a pint glass. Don't worry, I wasn't going to. Cork smells strongly of acetic acid.
Poured into a tulip. Tons of wispy white foam, clear golden body. The foam leaves very good lacing as it recedes. Pretty outstanding appearance. Yeah, this looks pretty good to say the least. 
Smells gueuze-y. I get tart chardonnay grapes right off the bat, a little sour apple, some sweet pear. Sweet-Tarts candy. Fleeting notes of plastic in and out. While the wet cork may smell like pure acetic acid, the beer itself doesn't. Excellent aromatics. 
It's immediately mouth-puckering upon hitting the palate. I would say the level of sour is on the high side of moderate. As one would expect, the flavor profile is high on the chardonnay; very vinous with high acidity. Dank, leathery and woody without ever really bringing the funk. Hops at the back end, there's a little more bitterness than I'd expect with a beer like this. Pleasant oaky-white-wine finish and aftertaste. 
While carbonation is obviously high, it doesn't really have that much bite to it. And that is a good thing, I think. It's more like a slow-burning flurry of smaller bubbles rather than something carbonated to the degree of annoyance. 
For those who enjoy sours, drinkability is high, limited only by the state of your wallet and the ability of your stomach to continue handling the high acidity. I think of this as a gueuze, as good as any Belgium has to offer. In most cases, I'd say a 750ml bottle split with someone will be sufficient. It goes without saying that this would be a good one to give to wine afcionados, but I figured I'd say it anyway.
I knew this was a very good beer when I first had it at a tasting, but it has been fun to really get to know it over the course of a 750. 1,956 charactersPatrick999, Feb 12, 2010

A - Pours a hazy gold with lots of white head. Maybe 3-4 fingers. Dissipates slowly leaves behind some beautiful lacing. Carbonation is light-to-moderate.
S - Lacto, lemon, honey, and wild yeast funk.
T - The above and chardonnay grapes. There's also moderate citrus as well. It's really good.

4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Looks wonderful. Pale orange color with bubbles actively rising, a thin, even, creamy head.
On the nose, obvious characteristics of chardonnay (apple, citrus) and oak (vanilla). A bit phenolic, some funk, and a hint of honey.
Sourness hits first then lets the fruit characteristics seep in. A bit of vanilla is felt on the finish.
Well-carbonated and balanced. Obviously has quite a drying effect on the palate.
High acidity limits the serving size, but the taste gets better through a bottle. Flavors are very well-integrated. 531 charactersoceanman, Feb 10, 2010

 A - Yellow with a hazy finish and a moderate white head. The head sticks around for a while and leaves a nice thick coat of lacing.
S - Funky with some fruit. Very little oak (which works for me).
T - Sour and tart from start to finish. It lingers nicely. The oak contribution is mild and I think it works well. I don't like it when the oak overpowers everything else.
M - A moderate consistency with a high carbonation of very fine bubbles. It's just right for the style.
D - This beer packs loads of flavor yet is very well balanced and drinkable. It's not priced as an everyday beer but it makes for a great treat. 691 charactersGJ40, Feb 09, 2010

Just popping from the cork, my nose is greeted with big whiff, reminding me of funky fresh goat cheese, with a light lemony zest in the background. It foams just to the top of the bottle, barely breaching the surface. Poured into the glass it has a big bone white head, with fair retention and some lacing. The taste is amazing, its very tart and dry with a nice citrus background. the finish is impeccable full of oak and butter, really drawing out the california chardonnay from the barrels. The buttery finish makes an odd sensation on the way down, but other that its very fizzy and very drinkable! 612 characterssomabeer, Feb 08, 2010

A - Pours a nice cloudy yellow, looking quite a bit like your typical wheat  weizen brew
S - Not sure if it's the brett or not but it has a little bit of a sweet scent, also a little bit of fruit is evident as well.
T - Eek, this is not my first sour beer, so the concept is not new to me. Will definitely say that this is not my preferred beverage. I guess it's well done for what it is, but I'm not sure how this style became popular.
D - I sucked it down, since I paid good $$ to get this shipped from CA to NY. Not my fave Russian River brew. I was glad once it was done.
M - Good body and feel. I can't fault anything in the brew itself, I'm just not a fan of the style. 723 characterstdawgydog, Feb 08, 2010

4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have had very limited experience with wild ales, and Warheads are much too sour for me. Thanks to Halley for picking me up this bottle when she was at the brewery!
A: Straw yellow body with a tinge of orange. Three-finger bone-white head that slowly dissipated over a few minutes, leaving some good legs. Slight streams of small bubbles slowly slip to the surface. 
S: Barnyard aroma similar to some farmhouse ales I have tried, with sour citrus notes.
T: The sourness comes first, with tinges of apples and lemons. It does induce a slight mouth pucker, but is not as intense as I feared it might be. Oak is very evident in the middle, though it's not too strong either. A small note of wine is noticeable as well. The aftertaste is of a light sourness, with carbonation still tickling my tongue.
M: I thought the fairly high level of carbonation balanced the flavors well, keeping everything light, balanced, and refreshing.
D: Tasty, light, and a mere 7.25% abv equals a beverage that I could easily have another of. 
I was quite pleasantly surprised by this beer. I haven't had nearly enough wild ales to know if I am a fan or not, but Temptation certainly gave my initial skepticism about this style a good thrashing. I certainly hope to acquire more of this for nights which demand a lighter beer than my customary malt bombs. 1,339 charactersWorldWideStout, Feb 05, 2010

A- pours a hazy light gold straw color. less head than anticipated. just a thin film of white head.
S- tons of funk and tart white grapes. the brett and wine barrels play well together and blend together near perfectly and manipulate the blonde ale base into a totally new, very well crafted beer. the smell and I'm guessing the flavor will be near the same.
T- this is my first RR sour and I was expecting the sourness to dominate a little more. instead it's exceptionally complex. a ton of flavors blend together in a very pleasing way. the sour/tart fruits (grapes...maybe apple or pear) are at the forefront with a little sweetness but blend into an awesome mixture of oak barrel and brett/barnyard funk. 
M- as I said earlier the carbonation is a bit light. despite that, the light body and dryness combine to make a delicate wine-esque beer. could be downed easily but begging to be savored.
D- a beer that you could really drink all day. 7.25% drinks like 4%. subtle and complex flavors keep you coming back for more. I would certainly keep a stock of this if it was readily available. 1,160 charactersFreethyhops, Feb 02, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured 8 oz into a red wine glass and allowed it to warm up to about 50 degrees before sampling/reviewing.
A: Pours a golden amber, almost adjunct-like color into the wine glass, with the exception of one notable characteristic. The hues produced by light passing through the beer are pink and orange, which you will never find in macro. Carbonation looks thin, but upon further review, champagne-like streams of tiny almost unnoticeable bubbles stream upwards towards the air from no fewer than 5 different nucleation points.
S: The unmistakable funk of brettanomyces is clearly evident, though it seems that having added it only in secondary has changed its effect on the flavor of this beer. Instead of the strong and aromatic sourness, I get a bit more of a farmhouse-like Belgian funk. There are definitive notes of oak and chardonnay from the extensive barrel-aging process, as well.
T: Aside from the sour character being much stronger in the taste than it was in the aroma, the main character of this beer is the chardonnay. An almost astringent acidity from the barrel aging seems to overwhelm any other characteristics that this beer has to offer. However, the finish does hint at what this beer could turn into with age. I catch fleeting wisps of sour apple and earthy malts that attempt to bring some balance to a fairly green beer.
M/D: Again, Russian River excels in balancing the effects of the carbonation content with the sourness from the wild yeasts. The tingly and puckering again meet a delightful balance. As good as this beer will likely become, I can't fully appreciate the nuances of this beer against the strong flavors of chardonnay and brett. I think that this beer lacks some of the complexity that I was hoping for, but overall, it is a very good beer, and I wouldn't hesitate to get to the bar early again to have another opportunity at this one. 1,881 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Feb 02, 2010

A: This one was explosively carbonated. A slight twist of the cork sent it flying through the air and to the ceiling. The beer itself is slightly hazed and straw colored with a fluffy white head.
S: The nose is not as overly "green" and tart as the servings of the newest batch have been. A nice level of Brett funk and dryness goes well with some tannic oak and a slight lactic and green apple tartness.
T: The flavor also is a bit heavier on the wild aspects and really has a nice mustiness to it. The tartness is not overpowering but provides a nice level of acidity and fruit (grapes, lemon, and apple).
M: The body feels a bit fuller than the newest batch, but that could be the high level of carbonation. The finish is nice and dry.
D: This batch seems to be quite superior to the newest batch and I see why people rave about Temptation so much. Great flavors and a really crisp, dry, and refreshing beer. 1,019 characterswomencantsail, Feb 01, 2010

Smell: Sour lemon, with a little bit of horsey, bready, and yeasty. Some banana, honey, and tart apple with a little nutmeg. Delightful and complex.
Taste: Not as complex as the nose, unfortunately. A brief moment of breadiness, honey, and a touch of lemon oily before fairly intense sourness (lemons and cherries) sets in. Barrel aging contribute s to some dry earthy woodiness. There is a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg too. Low carbonation.
Notes: Overall very fresh tasting with a light, tart profile. Intense sour flavor but not overdone. 566 characters4000qtrap, Jan 31, 2010

Pours a clear golden body with a beautiful white frothy head. A maize-colored suspension of yeast clouds the beer as I pour the last few drops into my glass. This leaves a swirl of tan on the top of the head - I'm impressed already. Tiny bubbles continue to rise from the bottom of my glass, long after I start drinking. As I work my way through this one, the head retains amazingly well despite the massive amounts of lacing left in the glass.
The smell is a combination of the sour funky smell with apples. The chardonnay is also apparent, but not significant. It doesn't provide the most powerful aroma, but what is there is excellent. A bit funky and a bit of wet straw.
What a great beer... as the first drink hit the back of my mouth, the tart punched me in the top of the mouth. My glands puckered and I took a look at the reactions of my buddy and my wife. We all kind of looked at each other and back at our glasses before grabbing another swig. Amazing. The tart was not overpowering, but definitely a significant part of the beer. My mouth is actually watering as I'm typing this review (seriously). The beer itself is excellent but the lemon-like zest is phenomenal. It is clean, crisp, and surprisingly dry. The taste is there and then gone. I get a little bit of the oaked wine taste...along with some other flavors I'm not sure if I've even had before. This is just outstanding. I split this bottle with two others, but could have easily had one to myself and not gotten tired of it. How do we get this delivered to Indiana?
As I continue to explore these Wild Ales, I find myself more and more drawn to them. Temptation...fitting. This beer certainly helps perpetuate the growing popularity of the style. I was thoroughly impressed and will definitely be tracking down some more! 1,934 charactershayesez, Jan 27, 2010

Thick white head of medium bubbles held up shortly by moderate carbonation of medium to large bubbles that rose through the beer quickly. Head leaves a lot of lacing on the glass as the beer is drank.
Beer has a good sour aroma followed by a slight funk. Sour aroma seems citric rather than acetic or lactic.
Whoa, this is a sour. Puckering citric sour flavors. Once the shock wore off, its amazing. Beer is really smooth. Drinkability high, mouthfeel great. Crisp finish, no aftertaste, there is a hint of oak in the back after drinking for a while. This is a great beer. 743 charactersdrabmuh, Jan 25, 2010

Pours a murky straw yellow with a chunky white head.
Smells like lemon zest, oak, chardonnay, yeast and some earthiness.
Taste is sharp lemon up front with chardonnay and oak towards the end. Earthiness from the brett left on the tongue in the aftertaste.
Low carbonation and on the lighter end of medium body.
Drinkability is fair. I couldn't see myself drinking this one all night but it definitely is a solid beer, just not sessionable in my opinion. This one needs to be savored. 541 charactersauroracrisis, Jan 21, 2010

A: Pours a hazy light brown/orange-yellow. Nice carbonation and a fluffy, persistent one and a half fingers of head. It really does not disappear as it sits out for...quite a bit, still with one and a half fingers just sitting lightly on top. Pretty nice and fluffy webs of lacing up and down the glass, but it pales in comparison to the head on this, which is damn impressive.
S: quite nice and sour, but also some orange, lemon, and pink grapefruit citrus taste. A little funky, grassy, and hay-like. Slight barnyard smell, but not a huge one. A bit of cloves and buttery/peppery scents are also present, and maybe some sweet red apples, peaches, and tangerines as well as white grapes, white vinegar, and a slight, hard to identify funk.
T: pretty sour--perhaps the most sour I've had, but in a very mild and pleasant way somehow. It's a sort of combination of granny smith apples, cider, and white vinegar, though certainly not apple cider vinegar. A little lemony also, maybe even with lemongrass and hay. 
M: Very fine, tiny bubbles, not too few or too many.
D: I'm not entirely sure, as I've been sipping this one for a bit with a friend and haven't particularly tried to drink it quickly. It seems, however, pretty drinkable for how sour it is. 1,319 charactersafausser, Jan 14, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle. Batch 003. Purchased at the brewery when it was first released and kept at cellar temperature. Poured into a tulip glass. Comes in at 7.25%.
A-When the cork is removed it lets out a nice pop. When poured it has a semi hazy straw yellow color. It has a crackling two finger off white head. The head has some great retention and results in some nice patches of lace. Plenty of bubbles continuously shoot up from the bottom of the glass.
S-It has a really nice blended nose. It is not overly sour/tart. There is barnyard funk, musty oak barrel, sweetness, and tart pear and apple.
T-It starts out sweet with some noticeable malt flavor. Fruits such as lemon, cherry, and white grapes hit mid-sip. The oak barrel flavor is definitely noticeable throughout and imparts a lot of vanilla into each sip. The vanilla flavor lingers. It is tart, but not over the top. The strongest tart flavor comes as it goes down at the end. 
M-Medium bodied, dry, and nicely carbonated.
D-A really nice sour. It has a nice level of tartness that is not super strong. It has more vanilla than I remember.
One of my all time favorites. This batch is almost two years old and is tasting great. The flavors have come together quite nicely. 1,232 charactersmjl21, Jan 13, 2010
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was without a doubt the best beer I have ever tasted! 
A - A beautiful inch and a half thick head that lead to some serious lacing on the tulip glass. The color was golden - what I would imagine an angel looks like!
S - Sour, very sour! Brett is there - but not overpowering. I just want to take a bath in it, it is so inviting.
T - Temptation is so unique and so well crafted. It tastes like Sour Patch Kids and the sourness tingles my lips - amazing!
M - Perfect!
D - Very, very, very drinkable! At 7.75% abv it goes down smooth. Do whatever it takes to drink this beer - classic! 592 charactersPlinythechugger, Jan 11, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +7.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Temptation, served from a 750 mL bottle courtesy of dkachur at the January C'ville gathering. Poured in to a cervoise.
Appearance: A cloudy yellow hazed body, sort of dull, sunny, juicy-looking. There's really not too much to be said about the color - it's uniform, sort of a hazed golden, and doesn't really lend itself to to many more adjectives. But beyond that - and what truly makes this beer gorgeous - is the absolutely unequivocally amazing head. The finger and a half of fluffy marshmallow foam is immaculate and unbelievablely fluffy. The initial one finger of cream does not, ever, once fade below that, maintaining a fluffy, dense, dry, rocky, clingy mass throughout the experience. The lacing continues the trend - huge, fluffy, sticky, three-dimensional. This is just a fantastic-looking brew, inviting and invigorating. I find no flaws.
Aroma: I originally had this penned at a 4.0, but as it warmed, this one got far more inviting, with the Brett coming to the forefront and melding beautifully with the more pronounced aromas. Crisp and golden pale malts provide the base for this beer, moderately sweet but with a dryness that augments most of the other aromatics: 1) a dry, crisp, mouthwatering amount of acetic tartness (more tart than sour) that isn't overwhelming but instead blends and augments; 2) a faint Bretty underpinning, funky and horseblanket-esque; and 3) the miscellany, if you will, with peaches, oranges, light tannins, Granny Smith apples, and green oak. A varied, complex, and balanced profile.
Taste: "Balance" is a word that, more than any other, describes this beer. It's a tart beer, for sure, slightly sweettart-like in places, but describing only this aspect doesn't do it justice. Pale, simple malts, fruity peach and banana and lemon notes, faint barnyard funk, estery oak and tannins, and the aforementioned moderate to heavy, acetic tartness don't overrun each other, and none struggle for time in the spotlight. Everything here is in perfect balance for someone at my stage of sour exposure, and thus I have no choice but to rate it a 5.0.
Mouthfeel: Crisp, bright, sunny, lively, effervescent ... throw in whatever words here you'd like that serve to indicate that this brew is highly carbonated but light and dry and fluffy enough to balance and balance effortlessly the flavor components here.
Drinkability: No wonder this is a top 30 beer on BA. It's easily one of the best 5 beers I've ever had, and and at a mere 7%, it's one of the few "amazing" beers I've ever tried that I could - if it were more available - drink again and again and again. The best Russian River brew I've yet to try, and thus - in my opinion - the best of their wilds (Supplication, Consecration, Beatification being the ones I've tried), this one succeeds not because it is the most sour, or the most funky, or the most &lt;fill in the blank&gt;, and instead excels in the authenticity and quality of what really epitomizes sours in my mind - balance. More please. 2,997 charactersCrellMoset, Jan 11, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +9.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap, 7/19/09 in Orange, CA.
A - Golden and effervescent, with a thick white head that stuck on the sides of the glass.
S - Golden ale with a nice, mild funk smell. The smell kind of floored me, as I was expecting something sour-bombish. 
T - Oh wow. Wonderful golden ale... the fruit notes were present and somewhat muted. The sour I was expecting? More like a nice finishing tang than anything.
M - Fluffy and crisp. Loved it.
D - Easily drinkable. I put down two of them back to back. Just lovely.
This was my first experience with Russian River and Vinnie's beers. It was an eye opening experience to be sure! I would drink this daily if it were available to me. Just shy of my perfect beer, though I can't imagine anything being better in this category. 766 charactersmutterfudder, Jan 10, 2010

4.5 A: Hazy golden straw color. Two fingers of pillowy white head. Most of the head falls quickly, but the last 1/2 finger sticks around for a long time. Plenty of lacing.
4.5 S: Brett funk for sure, but way more funk that just the brett alone. Tons of barnyard funk with hay and horse blanket. Healthy fruity tartness backs up the funk. Oak tones linger. Very nice.
5.0 T: Brett barnyard funkiness again. Tart, but not overly so, fruitiness including wild orchard red apples and peaches. Straw and peppery yeast. Oak hits the spot as well. It does have plenty of chardonnay aspects as well. Excellent.
4.5 M: Lighter medium mouthfeel. Bubbly carbonation is perfect. Smooth with no major flaws. Tangy tartness on finish.
5.0 D: The most drinkable wild and one of the most drinkable of any brew. I could sip this all night long. I wish my bottle was 3L. 891 charactersDavoleBomb, Jan 08, 2010

A- Pours a hazy golden yellow color. Nice 1 1/2 finger white head that dies down after a little bit. Lacing was nice with this beer being all over the glass.
S- Citrus and other sour style fruits. There is a little oak in the tail end of the nose. Big funky barnyard smells. Nice sour smell that I associate with Brett. Made my mouth water. 
T- Big brett sour tones to this one. Some barnyard funk and something else I can't quite put my finger on as far as sourness. Wine vinegary taste in the middle to end of this. Lemon flavors upfront and some oak in the tail end of this. 
M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little on the high side for me with this beer. Not a bad thing though. Nice sour flavors with some citrus left on the palate and aftertaste. Makes me want to lick my lips after each sip to taste more sourness. Clean tasting as much as it can be for the style.
D- Nice drinkability although I could not have a whole lot of this. I mean I could but the acidic tones to this limit it as little. Russian River cracks another one out of the park with this beer. Way to go! 1,209 charactersalleykatking, Jan 04, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 003, thanks Jason! 
First beer of 2010.
Poured into an Oerbier stemmed wine glass, it pours a bright honey gold with effervescent champagne streams. Lace is sticky and adheres itself well. The surface skim never really breaks. 
Aroma from the glass is strangely different from the bottle. The bottle has a sweet acetic white wine vinegar and washed rind cheese thing going on. The glass has a very minerally, flinty wet stone nose, backed by hay and honey notes. As it warms there are some florals too. I'd give the bottle a 5 and the glass a 4, so 4.5 it is. 
Temptation sings beautifully. It has elements of Chardonnay, tart and minerally, bright and puckering. Light on the palate yet full and complex. Not especially oaky, which is good. Dry and fruity with grapes, orange, lemon, and cheese. Very effervescent and dry like champagne. A wine-lovers conversion beer for sure. Off the charts drinkability. 
Paired well with cheese, we had Capriole Wabash Cannonball and Delitia Taleggio. 999 charactersemerge077, Jan 01, 2010

Poured a hazy golden color with a medium head white head. Nose is big and funky, as some would say "horseblanket" and "barnyard funk", lemon, tartness. Taste is like a big lemondrop, grassy and def sour. Mouthfeel has a very nice mouthfeel, very champagne like, sour but not to much, lemon, funk.

4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3Served appropriately in a snifter. Although served on draft, the bottle is BAD ASS and is worth mentioning.
A: A thing of beauty. Average-sized, off-white head that I can only imagine would have been bigger had I poured it. Slightly hazy/cloudy body. The body was a yellow-gold color.
S & T: Grassy, lemony hop bill, not much malt character to speak of. The big aroma and flavor is clearly the outrageously sour fruity funk. Brettanomyces are in the building. Barnyardy, earthy and surprisingly leathery (?). Residual oak flavors from 12 months of aging. Some vinous flavor/texture quality pulls through as a result as well.The fruit flavors are pronounced: sour green apple, white/green grapes, and lemony vinegar. This is one sourly delicous brew and, in my opinion, the benchmark for American Wild Ales.
M: Another incredible aspect. Full body, gritty texture with the carbonation levels of champagne. Not only is the finish astringent, every single second is like a Times Square New Year's Eve party in your mouth.
D: For me, the drinkability scale for wild ales must be adjusted, mainly because I find it difficult for any such intense brew (all styles included) to be rated with a perfect 5. That said, I slowly sipped and thoroughly enjoyed my Temptation over an hour or so. This beer gets my highest adjusted rating for Drinkability (scale of 1 to 3). 1,363 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Dec 29, 2009

I think this is one of the better sour ales I've had, maybe even better than many of the cantillons. This is to that beer what Damnation is to Duvel. 
I highly recommend this beer. 394 charactersdavid18, Dec 28, 2009
4.18/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch # 004X1 stamped on bottle
A loud POP of the cork and we are off. It's a wild ale night here in Sudbury as I sit to watch the original "Rollerball" (1975) on On-Demand. 
The beer pours with a fluffy white head that appears delicate. The beer itself is a shockingly bright gold color with perfect clarity. Almost a bright brass color. A decent amount of visible carbonation.
The aroma is quite bold and you can actually smell it just from sitting next to the glass. Sharp, tart, vinegar like. Definite notes from the yeast (brett) Earthy.. After a bit you can sense the oak.
Tart green apple, white wine flavors, stonger oak than I even imagined. The earthy, yeast flavors are quite bold. I try not to use the work funk... but I think I just did. Lots of barnyard notes. I drank the first part of the bottle then enjoyed some with some cheese and crackers. Went perfectly. The sparkle and brightness cut right through the fat of the cheese. Finishes rather dry with, of course, that tart tones sticking with you. The more I drink it, the more I get some nutty flavors. 
Champagne like in body and carbonation. (slightly less effervescent) refreshing actually. Clearly acidic.
Very enjoyable and goes down smoothly. Like many sours (wild ales) you can only drink so much before the acidic nature gets to you. It's clear to see why this is so highly thought of. 1,368 charactersReagan1984, Dec 28, 2009

Pours a nice white head. Great retention. Nice splatted lace. Color is a clear golden straw yellow. Just what this beer should look like.
Aroma: sour with brett and barnyard flavors. Oak, lemon, and sour fruits. Pretty solid.
Taste: Hmmm, this is kind of interesting. A lot of brett here with some other sour bugs. Barnyard funk with lemons. Some nice oak flavors as well. Well done.
Mouthfeel: Sour and funky. Mouth puckering. Light to medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Ends very clear, a tad sour.
Overall, a solid heavy beer. Very well done. I really enjoyed this beer. Very drinkable. I'd like to try this with a few years on it. I think it could get even better. 726 charactersmothman, Dec 25, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 004X4 from 2009 release I believe
Straw color appearance with bright lemon/citrus and fruit flavors and aromas like apple and pear. Oak flavor is well-balanced and the tartness of the Brettanomyces is really nice. It really does have some resemblance in flavor to a chardonnay with some funky hay, barn, and grassy undertones mixed with some sour acidity. Everything works really well together. Vinnie Cilurzo took all these individually gross flavors and made something totally amazing! I really don't know how he is able to integrate flavors so well together, but his beers really have a lot of depth. 
The mouthfeel is typical Russian River, that is soft and perfect. There was quite a lot of foam even though I made a soft pour. Definitely a drinkable beer, in fact I almost went through the entire bottle without noticing. Definitely worth a try for anyone who's interested in sours, but I'm still a slightly bigger fan of Consecration.
Edit: this beer has lingered in my mind and become one of my all time favorites! I love the lightness and dryness of the beer and really can't get enough of it. "I can resist everything except temptation" - Oscar Wilde 1,169 characterswd40, Dec 21, 2009

Aroma is lemon marmalade with hints of other citrus, and a big tart element. Flavor is more lemon, melon, and sweet tarts. Girardin Gueueze comes to mind as the closest sibling, though Temptation has a thinner flavor and feel, and I'd prefer the Girardin, especially with the price tag. Still a very nice beer. 394 charactersgyllstromk, Dec 20, 2009

A - Poured carefully into the glass to yield a mildly hazy bright golden colored beer with two fingers of fluffy white head on top. An endless supply of carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass, a beautifully active and champagne like effervescence. Head lasts for a long time...doesn't seem like it wants to give it up.
S - A bit on the sweet side, plenty of brett funkiness. Lots of sour fruit, especially apples, some orangey citrus. Also a winelike light fruitiness is strongly present, obviously coming from the time in the barrels.
T - Taste closely matches the aroma. Distinctly sour and puckering, but quite flavorful and complex. Light citrusy fruit - lemons, oranges, sour apples. Lots of winelike character, though more pinot gris than chardonnay for me - this pairs really well with the other tart and fruity flavors in this beer. Only a touch of woody oak flavor comes into play, but this plays off of the brett character to blend nicely. Less funk in the flavor than the aroma although plenty prominant, probably will be more pronounced with some age on it.
M - On the thin side, as expected, and loaded with carbonation. Very prickly and a bit foamy on the tongue. Sour and tart, a bit puckering and quite drying after the swallow.
D - Extremely drinkable American Wild. Quite tart, but not overpowering - very refreshing on the tongue. Alcohol isn't overpowering at 7.25%. Very bright, fruity, tart with a touch of sweetness. A 750ml bottle is just the right amount for me. Glad to be able to try this one...gotta see about getting some more. 1,702 charactersportia99, Dec 19, 2009

A: A clear light gold color with a very thin white head. No glass lacing to speak of.
S: Tart smells with apple and fruit with a slight sugar sweetness. 
T: Wow, this is damn sour. Tart flavors hit the tongue with flavors of sour apple, pear and some green grape. There is some slight woodiness and a nice grassiness to it from the hops with a slight sugar sweetness to slightly offset the tartness. Finish is all sour that makes your tongue curl for minutes afterwords. Crisp, clean, wow. This is much greener beer that is much sharper than that from an aged bottle.
M: Crisp, clean, tart, flavors linger. No traces of alcohol.
D: Suffered a bit because it was so young. The beer is mouth puckering but delicious.
Overall what more can I say. Spectacular, what a great beer that is infinitely more sour from tap when the flavors don't get to meld together. I think I like this more from bottle as it mellows, but this one is excellent when young and razor sharp also. Incredible. 1,054 charactersKadonny, Dec 11, 2009

The aroma was full of funk steeped with a fruity backbone. The flavors are somewhat vinous, and oaky. It is very dry and has some lemony zing to it. There is also a slight sourness there also. A very light bodied beer that leaves you dry. The acidity knocks down the drinkability for me, but an otherwise great beer. 432 charactersbonkers, Dec 10, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I happened to be visiting the brewery as Vinnie had finished and bottled, not yet labeled, his first batch of Temptation many years ago. He wasn't happy with some aspects of it but after chatting about the brew process for half an hour or so he brought up a few unlabeled bottles.
For the life of me I couldn't see what he didn't like about it, but then again anyone who knows Vinnie knows that he is a perfectionist. After tasting this and another beer (which I don't think ever went to market) he gave me a couple of bottles to cellar. I've just now seen it for the first time in a bottle in a beer store so was excited to down a few. This is absolutely one of the best beers that I have ever had.
Appearance - This is a beautiful, light straw blond in color with a gorgeous head. It's not big and foamy like a giant Belgian or a Weizen of course, but the bubbles are so incredibly tight and even you almost hate to drink it. Almost.
Smell - This is the most refined sour aroma I have ever had the pleasure of smelling. It's neither harsh nor offensive yet is still potent and sharp. The light grains in the background are equally refined.
Taste - The sourness is definitely a home run here. It is exceptionally strong yet not harsh like so many other Wild Ales. There's just enough sweetness to tame the flavor.
I can pick up some light white wine notes, which I'm guessing after reading up on the beer from the RR site is the chardonnay that seeped into the barrels that they use to age this beauty shop. The grain again is like a delicious light blonde ale grain that ads to the airy feeling you get when drinking this beer.
Mouthfeel - This was my favorite part of the drink. It is definitely light-bodied with a mature and technically advanced sourness and that terrific grain backbone actually makes this sail through the mouth. The carbonation is pure perfection, again according to the website the beer is carbonated in the bottle. It's just an enjoyable, light, airy texture that makes you want to keep on drinking.
Drinkability - This is the most quaffable sour ale I've ever had. It goes down so smooth and is so refreshing. How he put this thing together I'll never know. 2,192 charactersRoyalT, Dec 10, 2009

A: Poured a thin floating film. Brew is a pear and washed out cloudy lemon color. Lacing is patchy but ample. 
S: Pear sourness, wood, funk, and a pleasant sweetness that I don't get in a lot of other sours. 
T: Sour opening fades to sweet on the first sip and its all I can taste... ok... I'm used to this. Going in for a second... oaky at the start that develops into a pear or other green fruit (more on this soon...). A third sip yields a dissipating sour flavor that reveals green apples and grapes. The sourness then creeps back in towards the finish. 
M: Light bodied, coarse, wet, and crisp. Finish is dry but not nearly as dry as some other sours. This one actually lingers a bit... out of style in my opinion... but it works.
D: Definitely would have this again as just like every other sour I've had, so complex and really a journey from beginning to end. Temptation does a couple of things different (presents a different set of flavors, not as dry, etc.) but all of it works and together create a truly worthy beer. I always thought I'd try this in the bottle before I'd get to have it on tap... but nevertheless... can't wait to have it again in the bottle!!! 1,310 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 06, 2009

A: Pours a hazed, golden straw color with 1 1/2 fingers of bright white head on top. Retention was fleeting and only a few splotches of lace were left behind.
S: Fantastic winey aromas of white grape, tangy green apple, funky barrel, sodden oak, and a bit of pear and peach.
T: Pretty much as above with more barrel flavors and a bit more funk as it warms. Tart grape and tangy apple with a mere kiss of vinegar.
M: I found this to be extremely balanced. The funk and sour weren't allowed to run wild. There are sweet, dry, and slick elements, too.

4.1/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5This poured a hazy gold with fluffy white head. It smelled like chardonnay grapes and fresh oak with lemon zest and bright funk and coriander. It tasted like tart and sour white grapes with light funk and spices, and some burnt sugar and lemon and orange zest. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a lasting sour aftertaste. Overall this had a great scent and taste with just enough funk but still very clean. It wasn't too overpowering, and the alcohol was well hidden, but this was still definitely a sipping beer. I still need more experience with brett and sour ales to fully enjoy this one, but I thought it was tart and terrific. I'm also very curious how this might age. 685 charactersPencible, Dec 01, 2009

4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got this bottle from nickd717 way back when, finally got a chance to crack it open tonight. Thanks Nick for the chance!
Batch 004X5. The most recent batch.
The first pour is clear golden color with an extremely lively carbonation. Subsequent pours are slightly hazy, which is what I love to see. Nice two finger of creamy white head is produced on the pour, and the retention is amazing. Leaves a ton of lacing all over.
The nose is a complex mixture of brett and sweet and sour, tart and juicy, there is some oakiness and lots of funkyness going on. Very impressive nose, and is pretty much everything I had hoped. You could call it a breath of fresh air.
The taste starts out sour and tart, cheek-puckeringly so, then gives way to a sweet fruitiness and smooth oakiness. Towards the end, nice funky brett characteristics come into play. Very vinous in nature.
Mouthfeel is light to medium, with a fine carbonation aiding the feathery light feel. Dry finish. Drinkability is awesome, I refuse to share the contents of this 750 ml.
Overall, a great intro to Russian River's sours for me. I've heard great things about all of them, and finally got a chance to try one. I'm very impressed and will seak this out in the future. Thanks Nick for the chance! 1,258 charactersMistofminn, Nov 26, 2009
4.48/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750mL Batch 4 bottle. Shared with friends on 8/22. from notes. Thanks for the bottle(s) Shane!
Pours a golden color with a wispy white head quickly seceding to a film. 
Aroma is downright funky. Musty straw, barnyard flavors. Mixing with chardonnay grapes, a hint of white pepper and lemon zest. Acidic notes foreshadowing the flavor. 
Tartness upfront with sour grapes, vinous notes. Chardonnay characters are well integrated. Funkiness also present. Not cheesy like some wild ales, but funk is abundant. 
Well carbonated, not spritzer-like which you find in some wild ales that are bottle conditioned. It's got a proper level of carbonation that just excites the taste buds enough to deal with the acidity. Drinkability is great for a sour ale, although I suppose I am a bit biased considering my recent love for these styles. I liked batch 3 a bit more, but this one is a hit and I'm glad I have a few bottles for the cellar.
EDIT: Had this again recently and batch 4 is really coming along nicely. Great soft oaky notes with the acidity levels continuing to develop. +.5 App, +.5 Drink. 1,095 charactersIneedabeerhere, Nov 25, 2009

S - It smelled funky with some farm house/horse blanket aromas. A yeasty spicy aroma with a touch of oak.
T - A nice funky/spicy taste that you expect from a wild ale with brett. It had touches of caramel and grains.
M - It was very crisp and smooth with an extremely dry finish. A light to medium-bodied ale.

Opened with a big pop... and large bubbles circulated the sediment all on its own... funny how they state a slow pour to leave the sediment in the bottle.... hard to do when its flowing around everywhere. Batch #004X1
- Straw yellow and golden... fizzy white head.. nice shallow layer that sticks around a bit as this seems to be a fizzing bubbly little monster.
- Just pouring it let loose a wild wine and sour aroma.... nice tart and sour white grape up front, slight hay funk, light sweet malt... nice woody oak notes...
- Very tasty sour... not at all vinegar-like which I love... rich undertones of white grape and currants.. riding along nicely on a woody oak blanket of sour and sweet light malts.... hints of spice show up long after the swallow. Light vinegar at the very end. What a well balanced and flavorful sour. Very well done.
- Tart, and spicy on the tongue.... leaves slightly dry, and watering all at the same time. Slight spice and oak left behind with an almost fresh wine and light olive finish,.
- Overall this is a fantastic sour, and one I wish I had another to let sit around even longer. Perhaps I will snag up another soon if they are still there. 1,269 charactersDocer, Nov 23, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Been tempted (heh) by this guy forever. Finally opening it to celebrate getting a job. Or at least the end of an interminable employment process.
It opens with a fantastic pop. 
Appearance - A nice light gold/hay color. A couple inches of big foamy head. It settles very slowly lacing all the way down. 
Smell - Lots of sour apple and vinegar. Very nice fruitiness and a hint of lemon. Definitely picking up the wine. Lots of oak. It's pretty funky with some wet hay as well. 
Taste - Wow, very nice and tart. It has a real champagne dryness. The apple and oak also comes through. Maybe some pear as well. Pretty funky as well. There is a nice lemon. This is almost like a full bodied champagne. 
Mouthfeel - Excellent carbonation. Light and crisp. 
Drinkability - Good. The funkiness and carbonation make one enough. But it goes down pretty easy. Need to remember to savor.
This is another excellent RR wild. I thought Consecration brought a little more to the table, but this is also excellent. It's just a touch mellow, but nicely balanced. 1,050 characterscallmescraps, Nov 23, 2009
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Received this guy in a trade with EliottJW. Batch #004X1. Poured into a over-sized Tulip glass.
Appearance: Big white foamy head. Maybe too excited when I poured it. Nice and clear yellow/gold color with some active carbonation bubbles clinging to the side of the glass and streaming upward to maintain the head for a few minutes. Plenty of lacing down the glass.
Smell: Hints of oak sweetness and even fewer hints of chardonnay from the barrels. Some mild fruity aromas of apple and citrus. Mostly a sour aroma with a little vinegar and with limited funk.
Taste: My Goodness. A good amount of puckering sour flavor that is somewhat balanced by some sweetness from the oak. Not overly funky, more wine-like but better than any wine I've had. Citrus comes through and just a hint of the green apples.
Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation. Light to medium body. Lingering sweet and sour notes on the tongue.
Drinkability: I'd drink this everyday if I could. Phenomenal beer. Nothing about this beer limits its drinkability for me, except maybe the 7.25% ABV. 1,055 charactersEzekiel81923, Nov 16, 2009
4.63/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this up in San Francisco and lugged it home. Batch 4.
Pours a somewhat hazy golden color with about two inches of rich white head. Keeps a full, pretty thick lace and leaves some very nice rings of stick on the sides of the glass.
Smell has a good blast of tart and funk up front, layered with some oak. Also some floral fruit aromas. Even a hint of sweetness. It's a nice nose, but it's not super strong, and sometimes it's a struggle to take it in.
Taste starts off with a nice sourness that persists all the way through. Some tart tree fruit, oak and spice are the other primary flavors. Doesn't sound like a lot of characteristics but it's very complex, as each mouthful delivers a different combination of flavors. The peppery spiciness gets more pronounced as it warms, as does the oak. The funky sour character is ever present but never unpleasant. It's very flavorful, very well balanced, and just plain really good.
Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry in the finish, yet it has a creaminess to it that belies the carbonation. It's very smooth for a sour, and I'd even call it somewhat thirst quenching.
This is about as drinkable as I can imagine a sour being. It's so smooth and flavorful. Just a great beer. 1,226 charactersnumber1bum, Nov 15, 2009

4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 004X1
Golden body capped with the creamiest alabaster head. Retention is fantastic leaving a nice trail of lacing as it subsides.
Solid barn yard funk and plenty of tartness dominate the nose. There is incredible balance though between the two dominating aromas. Tart young grapes and green apple meld with rather earthy notes, oak and musty horse blanket. 
First sip was an all on attack of puckering tartness. More of this is attributed to my lack of familiarity than the overall tartness of the brew. Assertive sour apple, lemon and wine like acidity. Peppery spiciness sits mid palate and clings to the tongue. Very subtle graininess and light earth grass flavor can be found as I search my palate. 
Light to medium bodied. Sharp and crisp while the finish is smooth and dry.
Tremendously enjoyable. Very hard to find a weakness in this beer. As this is my first experience with the Russian River sours I can now say it is well worth the hype. Thank you to Spdkilz for providing such an awesome beer for review #150. 1,031 characterskzoobrew, Nov 09, 2009

Poured out of a 750ml bottle Heard about Temptation for a while, finally found it for a reasonable price. Pours pretty clear yellowish. White small head. Smells very strong of lemon/citrus. Definitely a tart amoma...but expected for this Sour/wild ale.
Tastes exactly like it smells. Kind of tart, but a pleasant sourness. Pretty easy to drink and refreshing. Aroma stays with you even hours after your last sip. 
In my oppinion, it reminds me of Limoncello: just not as sugary and not as boozy. Easier to put down too. 559 charactersShadesOfGray, Nov 07, 2009

Poured a beautiful chardonnay but a bit more orange color with a fluffy white head that I admired. Left some nice but not over-the-top lacing. 
Smelled of oak, green apple, lemon, grass, wildness. 
Tasted very similar to the nose, but with cherry. Delightful taste supplemented by high carbonation and a medium body. Good enough to have an entire bottle myself. 461 charactersIntelligentsia, Nov 05, 2009

A: A nice bright clean yellow/golden color. Very crisp. Provided a very thin white head that dissipates quickly. There is a moderate amount of lacing.
S: A very distinct tart and sour smell with some oak mixed in. The smell was very strong but not overwhelming. 
T: Wow. Never really had a 'wild ale' prior, so this taste was very unique but quite enjoyable. A good amount of sour and citrus mixed in with a little oak. The oak flavor reminds me of the oak you may taste in a chardonnay. 
M: A heavily carbonated light/medium bodied beer. It is quite balance and leaves a nice crisp dry taste on the palate.
D: I certainly enjoyed this beer but only had one regrettably. This beer certainly makes we want to try other Wild Ales. Easy to drink but not sessionable. 794 charactersIronCitySteve, Nov 04, 2009

Poured a golden-orange with a quarter inch, bright white head that quickly dissipates into a fizzy skim that coalesces around the edges. Clarity is hazy/milky. Some lacing, but no legs. Nose is citrusy and buttery. Taste consistent with nose, some tartness, some green apple and some residual sweetness. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a consistent background effervescence that falls just short of prickly. Great beer and, based on my limited exposure, what I would consider a classic example of the style. A truly excellent beer. 627 charactersJwale73, Nov 02, 2009

Batch 004x3. According to the website brewed in 5/08 and bottled in June this year.
Pours a golden sunshine yellow with hints of apricot, slightly hazy. A gentle pour brings forth a finger's worth of pillowy white froth with excellent staying power. As it finally falls it leaves a very fine and thin lace.
Aroma is tart and sour overlaying a fruity sweet bread. Sour green apples. The oak is present, but not overwhelming. Light orchard fruits. Undefinable spices.
Flavor is strongly sour. Puckering lemon sour. A pithy bitterness and oak come through in the finish.
Body is light, effervescent, smooth and silky. Finish is puckering and very dry.
This is a very well done Belgian blond gone wild. The aroma balances all the varied characteristics superbly. The flavor favors the wild bugs a bit more than I'd like, with much less of the Belgian coming through. But a wonderful deviation from my recent string of American styled brews. 1,074 charactersgoatgoat, Oct 28, 2009
4.07/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Swimsum and I sampled Consecration and Temptation back-to-back yesterday. This Consecration was his. This Temptation was mine. Following review written from notes.
375mL batch 003 bottle poured into a New Belgium globe.
Appearance: Cloudy, goldenrod-colored body with a short, creamy, white head on top. Carbonation was much lighter than the Consecration (not surprising - it was a batch 2, second bottling). Clean; no lacing.
Smell: Strong white wine vinegar, doughy malts, and citrus. Smelled a lot like chardonnay. White pepper possibly? I got some milder spices in the nose as well. Sourness was stronger here than in the Consecration we just sampled.
Taste: Chardonnay sourness loomed large. In fact, this often tasted more like wine than beer. Citrus was very apparent, but the doughy malts found in the smell were much harder to find in the taste. I would have liked some more complexity here, but maybe I just need a more sophisticated palate. I'll work on it.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, delicately carbonated, and surprisingly kinda creamy. Acidity is actually quite low. Still very sour and dry, but pretty soft on the palate for a wild ale.
Drinkability: Very good and very smooth (for a sour), but not quite as deep as the Consecration (see review here: http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/45653/?ba=ThreeWiseMen). I'm still sitting on a Batch 004 Temptation. I'll revisit it again after I get some more experience with wild ales. 1,452 charactersThreeWiseMen, Oct 20, 2009

A - Cloudy yellow with a touch of amber, nice bubbly head with quick dissipation leaving no lacing. Pretty nice looking immediately off the pour.
S - Grapes, apricot, maybe a little bit of peach, mild yeast. Weak nose is actually kind of difficult to smell. Smells good, but needs some more body.
T - Wow, blows me away. Amazingly complex, you feel like this is going to get sweet and never does. Goes tart insteat in the middle, mild oaky finish reminds you of the barrel influence. Nice sour grape taste, very little yeast taste. This is outstanding.
M - Low carbonation, light body, nice dry finish. Just about perfect for this bear.

4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5pours a not quite transparent super-light gold, with an excessively fizzy bright white head that dissipates quickly, leaving a good sized island of bubbles stranded in the middle of an over-sized wine glass. The center continues to bubble aggressively, which makes the look of this beer only slightly more interesting than what it very closely resembles: bud light. The smell is primarily of chardonnay mixed with brett and perhaps a little citrus fruit (maybe orange?). it would score higher, but the aroma strangely resembles a hefeweizen, which disturbs me.
wow. a superb effort. this beer might convert me into a chardonnay drinker... but probably not. super sweet and super sour. the fruit and the wine perfectly compliment each other, and a very subtle oakiness sneaks in to contribute to the flavor blitz that is Temptation. very dry on the tongue, which gives off a wine-like bitter-sweet after-taste and again emphasizes the oak barrel aging, while the palate remains moist, almost slippery with goodness that begs for another taste. 
at first i didn't like it, but then i grew to love it. Im speaking, of course, of the excessive carbonation that allows this beer to dance lightly and gracefully along the palate, massaging your mouth with airy pleasantness. the drinkability is, well, decently amazing. 1,315 charactersjdklks, Oct 18, 2009

The beer pours a lightly carbonated, cloudy straw gold color. The head is about 1 finer high, decent retention, weak lacing just kind of runny. 
The aroma right off the bottle is sour funk horse blanket, but once the intial nose is gone it is a very light sensation that's tough to pick up anything on. There is a light grape smell, light notes of flowers, hops. 
The taste is amazing. It starts off light and sweet but then right away you get a stront tart bite and a hard sour finish.

Aroma has lemon, pear, apples, sour cherries, light barnyard funk and a hint of earthiness.
Taste is very tart lemons and orange with a perfect balance between sweet, sour, and funk. It is so very complex and I wish I could pinpoint all the amazing flavors I'm tasting.

I try to be a critic and find faults, but what faults are there here? It's a bit pricey? That's the only possibility I can think of. It's beautiful to look at. There's as much head stuck to the side of my Duvel tulip as there is beer left in the glass. It smells fantastic. Taste is heavenly. It's got all the funky smell of an Oud Beersel Gueuze with more kick in the palate. Mouthfeel could not be better. Holy crap, I'm going to give this a five across the board.

4.97/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A big thanks goes to augustgarage for this one. I was on pins and needles waiting for the UPS man. Since then I've been eyeing this one in my fridge for a week. Part of me wanted to open it the second it arrived, the other part of me never wanted to open it. Gave in to temptation at the advice of my roommate. Thanks, buddy. Cork did NOT want to come out of this one.. took a good minute. No matter. 
A- 750ml, poured carefully into wide snifter. I let the bottle breathe for 20 minutes or so, as my fridge is a tad cold. Pours a wonderful pale yellow, with a thin, thin head. Looks delightful, the coloration is superbly blonde. Beer looks pleasantly viscous, shape-shifting in the snifter. 
S- Intense. Is this a wine? The chardonnay barrels come through in full force. Definite funk, a earthy woodiness, and more complex fruit than I can pick out in one sniff. Prob. one of the top 3 complex bouquets of any beer I've had. 
T- For the power of the nose, this beer is remarkably subdued. Amazingly tasty, though. Tart, drying like a fine wine. A mind-bogglingly good combination of gentle sweetness, carbonation, and funk make for the holy trinity of beers. Seriously... I want a gallon of this stuff, ASAP. 
I taste a tart apple, mild lemon, and a mead-like honey sweetness. There's a tonic water quality to this one, as well, which plays wonderfully off the fruit sweetness. Not to be outdone, the woody earthiness and the Brett finish leaving you scratching your head. So many flavors that just fit perfectly. I cannot fathom the trial and error that went into producing this beer, but it was so worth it. I had high hopes for this one... and they were smashed, shattered, and decimated. 
Note- I thought this couldn't get any better. Second pour, I got all the yeast and whatnot. I was proven wrong... the funk is stronger, tastier, and fan-fuckin'-tastic.
M- Wonderful. Crisp, tart, sour, sweet, mildly acidic, and perfectly carbonated. This one dances across your tongue, begging for another sip. And another. And another. Before you know it, you're wondering where you can get some more. I'd drink this all day everyday if I was a millionaire. As it is, it was an amazing treat.
D- Through the roof. We'll see how I feel tomorrow (stories of gastro issues have made the rounds), but I would buy a boatload of this in an instant if I had the chance. A smile all the way down, one of the best... by far. I would give this perfect 5's... appearance just wasn't earth shattering. But where it counts? This beer excels. Trust me. The best-tasting beer I've ever had.
They often say don't believe the hype. I agree.... this one is far beyond words of praise. 
A *BIG* thank you to augustgarage... You made my day, week, month, and year with this one. 2,763 charactersShogoKawada, Oct 06, 2009
4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The taste has a nice complexity but does back off a bit versus the nose. Still a great flavor though. The malt comes out a bit more with a sweetness. But this is replaced quickly by a tart sourness that lingers into the finish. The wine and oak notes come out more versus the nose. The chardonnay notes are more distinct and has a light tannic feel on it. This helps bring out the oak notes though. The horsey, spicy notes back off but the brett is still notiTempting. Very tempting. Batch 2. Pours a very slight hazy, lemony yellow color with a golden hue throughout. A soft fizzy white head with limited retention and not much lacing. Some sticking to the glass, light viscous.
The nose is very complex. A nice sourness that comes out with a crazy array of fruit and barnyard notes. Some brett, horse blanket and a light butyric note that adds complexity. The fruit is subtle but apricot and peaches mixed with a light lemon peel aroma. Maybe a touch of acetobacter but I could be wrong. The wood character is light but as the beer warms it comes out more. A more oaky flavor with just a hint of vanilla. Some minor wine notes but limited. Some minor yeast notes, light acetaldehyde/green apples as it warms.ceable. The fruit notes come out as it warms and linger with a light sweetness on the back end. More of a lemon and apricot mix. But adds a nice complexity to the finish.
The body is light to moderate. The sour notes are nice and not over the top. Would have liked a bit drier, but just nit picking here. The carbonation is good and supports the beer. Overall a very enjoyable sour. Love the complexity of this one. 1,627 charactersOxymoron, Oct 05, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is not a bad beer. 
The appearance is golden. Golden nectar with a sexy head. The head has great sticky bubbles that leave a thick layer of lacing all down the sides of this glass. The color is so interesting because it has a sun gold color, but cannot be seen through. Just faint shadows can be seen meaning the haze is thick. Not very watered down either, a great body. 
The smell is amazing. When I popped the bottle the cork flew across the room and bubbles came pouring out. Then, the whole room smelt like a sour champagne. Chardonnay can be smelt as well as oak. I have never really pinned down the distinctive smell of oak until right now. Amazing. Lemon grass as well. 
The taste is mind boggling. This might be the gateway for me into sours. I have tried and liked Wild Ales and Sours before but this is on a league of its own. Tastes like a lemon champagne. Then mixed with a heavy blonde ale. The alcoholic taste that comes with a good white wine is present. Sour and a bit tart. The sourness is not overwhelming, it is just right. It is also not the first flavor, it hit me most towards the end. 
The mouthfeel is great, just superb. So smooth and crisp. It just foams up in your mouth like champagne, perfect body as well. Not watery at all, just perfect. The lemon and citrus flavors just grab your taste buds. My mouth never stopped watering. Great oily finish, kills everything in your mouth. Nothing tastes the same afterwards. 
The drinkability is sad. Why sad? It is sad because I only have one bottle of it and I am drinking it right now. I am going to trade for this. I need more. With some Wilds that I have had, they are great for a good long discussion with someone. You can sip on them and enjoy them over a period of time. This beer I cannot keep away from my mouth. Once I swallowed the first sip of Temptation I could not keep it away from my lips. Amazing. I was actually going into this beer thinking that it was just going to be mediocre. A blonde ale aged in oak? I hate blonde ales, and although Consecration was great, it was not like this. This is a whole new playing field. 
Bravo.

EDIT: It is almost a week later and I have not stopped thinking about this beer. This is the first beer I am going to give a full 5 rating to. This beer to me is absolute perfection. There is nothing that I would change to it, there is nothing that is wrong with it. Everything about it makes me extremely happy. So I am changing the 4.5 in appearance to a 5. The solid golden color was amazing and the lacing around the glass was superb. Cannot get this beer out of my mind. 2,610 charactersJmoore50, Oct 03, 2009

4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had the opportunity to drink a vertical of batch 1, 2 and 3. I found batch 2 to be the best of the three and this review is of that batch.
A-Clear, deep golden yellow with a thin bright white head that left spotty lace.
S-Batch 1 was intensely sour on the nose. The intesity of this sourness reduced as you moved to batch 2 and then 3. Batch 2 seemed to be the "just right" amount of sour/tartness. Nice, sharp and crisp bite with a touch of wood.
T-Quick, fleeting (but noticeable) buttery oak flavour from the Chardonnay barrels. After this quickly passes the sourness kicks in. Not over the top, especially in batch 2. Very nice with a sharp biting crispness.
M-Light bodied with a dry finish and a pleasant lingering sourness.
D-I think my tongue would shrivel if I drank too much of this impressive beverage----&gt;but a glass or two, sure thing! A very tasty and well made brew. 891 charactersDeuane, Sep 28, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a white birch glass.
The beer pours a hazy golden/burnt orange color with a very thick, frothy white head. As the head fades the lacing is foamy and sticky on the sides of the glass. The beer is highly carbonated, a little gushing after I popped it.
The smell is earthy, fresh cut hops and a light graham cracker malt. There is a lot of oak in the nose, as well as a slight alcohol presence. As the beer warms the smell gets noticeably sweeter and the graham cracker really comes to the forefront.
The taste is a lot like a mild geuze... Very sour up front, with lemony citrus, fresh cut grass and a lot of earthy smells. The earthy funkiness and barrel flavors play off each other very well and the finish is crisp and dry, very reminiscent of a chardonnay. The barrel flavors partner with the sour and citrus from the beer and match each other note for note.
The beer is carbonated perfectly for the style and the mouthfeel is crisp and dry, leaving me craving more after each sip. The alcohol is more present than I expected, leaving a nice warming in the stomach. 1,097 charactersrpstevens, Sep 28, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Temptation pours a slightly hazed, golden color. It's topped by a bright white head that fades to a thin layer leaving thick, frothy lace. The aroma has all of the elements of a godd sour beer. There's a good amount of acidity, as well as bright citric notes. The characteristic "hop sack" aroma from the Brettanomyces used in fermentation is present, as well as an earthy, woody undertone.
Temptation is very gueuze-like. There's a coarse, grassy quality to the malts upfront, but these characters are quickly overshadowed by an escalating, citric and acidic sourness that's present through the finish. Earthy Brett flavors and a mild bitterness round things up in the finish. Temptation is crisply carbonated and light-bodied with an intense dryness in the finish.
Temptation is a very good beer. The sourness, Brett, and barrel-aging give it a distinclty Gueuze-like quality. It's mouth-puckeringly sour, and awesome. 922 charactersEPICAC, Sep 27, 2009

S - Sour cherry, tart funk in the nose. Faint wood notes.
T - Wood more prevalent here. Wild sour liveliness with wood finish.
M - Medium bodied, lots of carb and the sour is balanced with the wood and malt.
D - Nice, but I wouldn't want more than a serving at one time. 356 characterssrandycarter, Sep 26, 2009
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4What's to say - this is a gorgeous beer. It feels more like a mild cider, or even an acidic white wine.
Pours pale yellow with a slight head. Aroma is ciderish and sour. Flavor is a bit ciderish but like a slightly oaky Sauvignon blanc (if you can imagine such a strange thing). It is acidic, ciderish and dry. The mouthfeel is thin and clingy, with a sour bitterness. 369 charactersSeanibus, Sep 24, 2009

S: Lots of tarness and sourness here, with a little bit of the oak coming through.
T: Lots of sourness coming into some tartness and a little bit of citrus.
M: Quite tart, fairly full for the style. Good amount of carbonation.

Batch 004X4 pours an effervescent gold/pear color with 2 fingers of beige head. Stellar lacing & good head retention
S: Sourness & dirtyness, fades as this warms
T: Sourness, grassyness, & dryness up front. Some hints of honey breaks through with tartness & sourness as this warms, along with a bit of grapefruit, golden delicious apples & pears. Finishes dry tart & sour
MF: Medium bodied, lively carbonation & so dry tart & puckery
Drinks pretty darn easy, probably the easiest drinking sour I've had 572 charactersrusspowell, Sep 24, 2009
4.19/5  rDev -5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Appearance: clear gold in color with a wispy head that remains as some surface bubbles. No lace develops.
Smell: woodiness and some funk are surprisingly pleasant on the nose.
Taste: big flavors here as biscuit, brett funkiness, oak, green grapes, and tart green apples are up front. There is a lingering chardonnay flavor that arrives late. Mild bitterness and some soft lemon citrus rounds it out. Hints of alcohol provide some warming.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied. Lightly crisp and very dry throughout. Long aftertaste as the funk and oak last a while.
Drinkability: this is a true slow sipping beer meant to be enjoyed over a long time period. It changes up as it warms, keeping it interesting. 700 charactersGavage, Sep 22, 2009

It smells of green grapes and apples. Quite sour and tart but in a way that one can really get behind. The finish is a blend of sour and bitter notes from the yeast. Really very enjoyable and drinkable - ordered a second pint and would have had another except for the hefty $8/pint price tag. Glad to have gotten the opportunity to try this beer. 444 charactersbobjonesSD, Sep 17, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - A cloudy light golden yellow/brown. The head is fluffy, white and moderately dense. While it does go down (slowly), a nice finger thickness retains. There is moderate lacing as well as pieces of the fluffy head are left clawing to the edge of the glass. 
S - Tangy lemon zest combines with the smell of crushed white grapes, giving the beer a sweet/sour smell that I think will transition nicely into the flavor. This is undercut by some distinct fresh leather (hooray, brett.)
T - The tart lemony flavor really squeezes on the outsides of the tongue while fruit sweetness of grapes, pears, apples boil on the center and tip of the tongue. Underneath is some uncertain oak flavor, uncertain in that it is not the traditional oak wood flavor, and more wood a fence surrounding a farm that cows have been rubbing against kind of oak (again, hooray brett.) Some light bready malts serve as one of the few tame, traditional flavors, and serve as a subtle signal to remind you that this is, indeed, a beer. 
M - The flavors coat the tongue quite well, covering every inch and straining every taste bud. Well carbonated to really make all of the flavors explode. 
D - Flavorful, thirst quenching, light in the stomach and a moderate ABV. The perfect drinker. 1,260 charactersschinebd, Sep 17, 2009

S: Wonderful Brett aromas. Funky barnyard, hay, grass, and some yeast. Very tart and sour, though it is never overwhelming. Lots of fruity aromas as well. Awesome.
T: Funky barnyard, hay, grass Brett flavors that follow the nose. Fruity flavors and dry biscuit. Again, very complex and awesome.
M/D: A light to medium body that is crisp dry and very refreshing. Though not watery at all. I can drink this all day. So easy and smooth to drink. I can never get enough of this.
I have had the pleasure of trying this several times now. I just love it, and highly recommend. 650 characterschamp103, Sep 16, 2009

A: Yellowish gold in color with lots of bubbles traveling up from the bottle of the glass. Not much head here but a fine layer sits on top providing almost leg like lacing.
S: The very fine smell of brett is present. There is a very nice essence of sweet and sour playing off of each other. Some oakiness and fruitiness also pervade.
T: This one hits all the taste buds on my tongue. The mix of sweet and sour is excellent and extremely enjoyable. Very much like a chardonnay with a very dry finish and and the taste of white grapes. There is also a bit of a peppery note as well.
M: Dry and tart. No booziness though.
D: Sometimes I find that sours are a bit difficult to drink more than a few ounces of but this one left me wanting more. 756 charactersmikey711, Sep 14, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to brewdan for this one. Batch 3, 2009 vintage.
A: Slightly hazy yellow color with orange hues. A pretty big ivory-colored head leaves some lacings.
S: A nicely sharp smell full of character. Funky horse blanket and aged cheese. Lots of tart fruits (apples, pears, lemon) and general notes of berries. Notes of fermenting apples as well. Light hints of oak barrel and a nice touch of alcohol in the background. A very impressive smell.
T: The taste is semi-sweet at first, but then turns rather tart. The tartness isn't really mouth-wrecking, but feels genuine and robust. A wonderful combination of pleasant fruit aromas (green apples, gooseberries, lemon) and funky notes of barnyard and mud. A hint of wood. Nice bretty flavors. In the finish, there's a mild grassy bitterness, sweet and phenolic alcohol, a gentle leafy hop note and a dry tartness. 
With the last poor (I let all the yeast go into the glass) the beer changes character a bit. The tartness is muted and notes of vanilla and nuts develop.
M: Light body with a refreshing cider-like carbonation.
D: A very good wild ale. This one could probably go head to head with some of the milder Belgian gueuzes. Very refreshing and enjoyable. Impressive. 1,225 charactersricke, Sep 13, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Newest batch, had on-tap at the RR pub. I've had this in the bottle in the past, with a fresh batch, on-tap, my initial impression is that this is quite dry, quite hoppy for the style, and quite oaky. Pours a cloudy golden with a thin head but superb lacing. Smells sour and slightly grainy with some lactic notes, green apples, herbal hops, and oak notes. The taste is a perfect balance between the oak barrel notes, sour green apple flavors, and light herbal hops. Tart and punchy, a very nice beer this batch. 512 charactersGeorgiabeer, Sep 13, 2009

A - Cloudy golden color with a nice white head that sticks to the glass.
S - Aroma is funky with light fruits, citrus, and white wine. 
T - Dry white wine, pale malt, Bretty tartness, slight funk, oak, lemon, and white pepper. Complex and very good.
M - Fairly high carbonation, almost like a sparkling wine. Finishes really dry.
D - Great. This is pretty refreshing for a wild ale and the sourness is not overpowering (which Beatification is, IMO). 552 charactersnickd717, Sep 10, 2009
4.63/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Ah, Russian River. You never let me down. 
After having the Consecration a few months back and being impressed beyond belief, I was anxious to try other "-tion" beers from RR. The Temptation was my first opportunity to do so and it did not let me down at all. 
I will not bore you with descriptions of appearance and smell because that seems to be well covered here. What I will say is that this is a phenomenal and complex beer that is well worth forking out the $20+ dollars for. The flavors are complicated but balanced and overall this was an amazingly crisp and drinkable beer. 
Definitely a sipper that you will want to savor. By the end of the bottle I found myself wondering where it all had gone and having to restrain myself from cracking open the bottle I am intent on cellaring. 793 charactersIDS, Sep 09, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is my third experience with Temptation--my first came about a full month ago and that led me to instantly buy 2 more 750ml bottles. Temptation was my first sour and it was the third beer to really bow my mind in the past couple months (the other two being Founders Breakfast Stout and Weihenstephaner Hefe). 
I went into my first experience with this beer with all kinds of mixed feelings and worries--I'd heard such mixed things about sours that I was truly worried. 
Probably one of my favorite beers thus far. Don't expect anything but perfection here. And of course it delivers...
Appearance is a cloudy gold color with some beautiful carbonation and a pretty incredible pillowey pure-white head that laces and retains exceptionally well. 
Smell is very intriguing- almost like a chardonnay with a nice hint of sourness. There's pear, oak, and a lot of grape (wine notes) on the nose as well.
The taste is beautiful. It's a heavenly experience. I fell in love with Russian River all over again the first time I had this beer. It's well balanced with some great sourness and acidity that don't need to mask the delicious yeasty and apple flavors. I bring up the apple because my good friend, not a beer advocate but someone open to trying new things anytime told me that it tasted like zours, his favorite candy, to him, and that it was subsequently his favorite beer of all time.
Temptation is a bit dry, wonderfully crisp, and an altogether delicious brew. I wish I didn't have friends to share it with because I want the whole bottle to myself but nonetheless I'm so glad to get to share this experience with others. 1,631 charactersoriginalsin, Sep 09, 2009

A: Clear, straw yellow color. The pour produced a quarter of nice bubbly, white head, that retained well and left some great lace.
A: Smells of white grape, apple, and chardonay. I get get the woodiness from the oak, some slight citrusy action,and the sourness.
T: Very much like a wine here. The chardonay oak barrel aging really comes into play. The beer takes on all the qualities of the wine. The white grape, apple, and sourness are very pronounced. The beer finishes very dry and tart, just like a chardonay.
M: Hefty amounts of carbonation deliver the flavors well, and give it a tingle. Light body.
D and overall impression: I could drink a ton of this stuff. Manageable ABV, with the light body make this one dangerous. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. This was my first sour from RR, and I can't wait to try more. Skal. 959 charactersGtreid, Sep 06, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this out of a 750 last night from the most recent batch, batch 4. Poured into a chalice at on the cooler side. Split with some other BAs, and was left wishing there was more at the end!
Appearance: A hazy golden yellow with champagne-like carbonation and hazy nature that clears after some time to sit. Looks a whole lot like a deeper Chardonnay, which hey, this is aged in those barrels!
Smell: Oaky, white-grape, pear, and, of course, the Brett yeast. The Brett is much more restrained here than in Consecration, and as such it doesn't smell overly sour, but that sour funk is certainly there. I actually got a bit more Lacto than Brett, but that certainly could've been the more oaky grape. Slight apple-juice like aroma as well, but the oak and grape are the most prominent. 
Taste: Another winner. Chardonnay-like initial acidity with a zing from the Brett that is slightly restrained. Followed by the main flavor-profile that was existant in the smell, and that is of the oak, grape, pear, and apple esters. The oak barrels here lead not to a something too heavy, but rather almost sprucy and more refreshing. Really, really well balanced as well, with the malt character being light and effervescent and the hops being mild as well, all matched perfectly with the yeast strains. Just very well done. It's so balanced and tasty that you almost forget to appreciate just how in proportion everything is. Really wonderful.
Mouthfeel: Very, very near a five, with an initial acidity and bitterness that leaves a long-lasting, powerful aftertaste of the actual flavor. Really, really nice dryness imparted by the champagne-style carbonation, and finishes much like a sparkling chard. 
Drinkability: These 95+ degree days leave me craving IPAs and Sours, and this came through big time. Fantastic beer that deserves high praise, if for no other reason than its extraordinarily balanced body, taste, and aroma. 1,919 charactersnomomentwasted, Sep 03, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Swung by Father's Office in Santa Monica to try this out on tap. Into a mini tulip glass, pours a decent head atop a yellow, chardonnay-like body. Quite vivid in color intensity; and though the head doesn't last long, it reemerges decently upon agitation. 
Intense aromas of white grapes, sour flavors, and some earthiness. Very pleasant and enjoyably intense. 
Sour flavors, with tinges of chardonnay, earth/dirt, and some of the tomato-like acidity I find in a lot of Brett-fermented beers that adds so much complexity. The overall taste, however, is light on the palate and very dry/crisp. 
Mouthfeel includes the stickiness on the gums, which again, I have found in a lot of Brett-y brews, with a lighter body. I could throw back at least two to three (maybe four) of these per session. 
Overall, this is another triumph from Russian River that virtually rivals their present masterpiece, Consecration. 910 charactersjminsc76, Sep 01, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 750mL corked bottle into a wine goblet. I can't wait!
Appearance: beautiful golden hue with a hint of opaqueness; lots of evident effervescence contributing to a thick, white, gorgeous head.
Smell: tart, fruity, bready; apples with notes of citrus. There's a very light aroma of something chalky which I quite like as well.
Taste: tart, chalky, yeasty/bready, very much in line with the aroma profile. Like a good cheese, this tastes like it's gone bad in the most delicious way. This would probably pair spectacularly with a nice roquefort or gorgonzola.
Mouthfeel: body is not particularly thick, and there is a huge well-integrated carbonation from bottle conditioning. I'm always a fan of a creamy texture in a higher-alcohol ale, and this sure has it.
Drinkability: definitely a sipper, with its over-the-top tartness, but this beer is interesting enough to keep me sipping until I finish the bottle. 922 charactersflagmantho, Sep 01, 2009
2.06/5  rDev -53.3%look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 2 | feel: 2 |  overall: 2Russian River's Temptation Blonde Ale pours off-yellow in a goblet or Chardonnay glass. There is a "whack in the head" lack of subtlety in the oak Chardonnay notes throughout the beer - sour apples, lots of oak, yeasty but not overwhelming. Well made, but beware of oak. 
Personally: For my taste buds Russian River's Blonde Ale in oak barrels doesn't work...maybe my taste buds will grow to like it.... 404 charactersWCBCFrank, Aug 31, 2009

Well, before I could even finish unscrewing the cage, the cork blasted off into orbit and flew all the way across the room, taking the cage with it! Damn, now that's some carbonation for ya :)
P: Slightly cloudy yellowish-gold with a huge, healthy head of pearly white foam. The crown is pretty thick and frothy, and features beautiful streams of bubbles rushing from the bottom to reinforce it. Showed excellent retention as it slowly deflated to form a thick cap on top, while leaving my glass caked with lace in the meantime. This looks great!
A: Mmm....very fruity! Ripened pears and green apples hit the strongest, but I'd swear there's a faint hint of bruised banana buried under the toasted malts as well. The brett funk stays pretty tame in the nose, while a wee bit of oak peaks through if you really dig in there. Not an in-your-face type of aroma, but one that offers a promise of subtle complexity in the flavor.
T: Mouth-puckeringly sour blasts of lemon zest and vinegar right from the jump. Buttery pears and green apples team up with white grapes and some tropical notes of peaches/apricots for a fruity concoction that plays nicely off of the barnyard funk. Speaking of the funk, it seems to share the foreground with the rest of the profile instead of crushing it, which is always appreciated. Toasted malts seem to flash more in the middle, then go quietly back to the supporting role, while the oak layered underneath lends a subtle hand in deepening the flavor even more. The back half of the mouthful gives way to a buttery chardonnay characteristic, which leads into a really enjoyably acidic, dry finish that lasts quite a while. All of this is swimming around in a pool of spices, with white pepper being the most evident. It seems like layer after layer of complexity become unraveled with each and every sip. Damn impressive!
M: Temptation is medium-bodied, with a rich, semi-sticky, mouth-coating quality that just blankets every square inch of the mouth with its delicious flavors. But, it doesn't quite blossom in the mouth like some belgians do, and I've gotta dock it for over-carbonation, too. The huge prickly bite is overdone and almost masks some of the more subtle nuances of the beer. Only 1/2 point worth of a complaint, though.
Notes: Don't get me wrong, I love the hell out of some sours when they're done right. But, I'm not completely fanatical about them in the way some others seem to be. However, I make it a point to drink each and every sour offering that Vinnie Cilurzo puts out, mainly because I know it will be fantastic. So, I'm happy to admit that I gave in to Temptation, and am extremely glad that I did! Fruity, funky, sour, tart, subtly complex, and downright delicious. I like Consecration a bit more, but Temptation is one hell of a brew! Highly recommended 2,854 characterssweetbrew82, Aug 31, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a very wide challis. Bottles were shipped last week, from Russian River. 
A - Pours a very pretty frothy/fluffy white head made of tiny bubbles. Streams of carbonation race towards the surface keeping the head covering the surface of the beer. The liquid has an oh-so-slight haze to it, but I can still see through. It's a perfect straw yellow in color and glows in the summer sun. Good lacing. 
S - There is a predominate green apple smell to it, with a slight tart acidy finish to it. Chardonnay sweetness comes through and a hint of warm hay follows. Very pleasant. 
T - Wonderful cereal wine. There are many different notes of tart and tang up front that clear the palette to . Then a very large sour granny smith apple hits with an acidic and dry finish. There is just a touch of sweetness that remains behind on the lips. Further into the bottle and a bit warmer some yeasty and straw notes come into play also. 
M - The Mouthfeel is incredibly light. High carbonation and a very dry finish. 
D - This is now my most favored sour beer that I have ever tasted. Each sip takes me further into the complexities of this beer and makes this warm summer afternoon more enjoyable. Its getting a 5 on the drinkability because it keeps getting better. Simply amazing. 1,281 charactersDwnTwnBwn, Aug 29, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured in my Russian River Stemmed Glass in celebration of completing my first week of my second year of law school (good excuse to try this!)
Appearance - When pouring this a brilliant golden/amber color emerges leaving a nice frothy finger of head which actually dissipates relatively fast. Additionally, there is minimal lacing. However, swirl the glass around a bit and I am able to obtain the initial head.
Smell - Overwhelming smell of tart fruits, the most apparent to me being green/sour apple with a hint of white grapes. I smell a hint of champagne emerge at the end.
Taste - Very pleasant. As soon as it touches my tongue I immediately taste the tart and tangy characteristic to this beer. I taste the sour apples, white grapes, some lemon/lime sourness, and some white wine/champagne like qualities. Honestly, this is pretty complex in tastes - I'm new to this whole style (overall) and it is already drawing me in.
Mouthfeel - Moderate/high carbonation that is reminiscent of champagne, with a moderate mouthfeel. Very crisp and refreshing after a 12 hour day of studying. 
Drinkability - The more I drink this the more it keeps growing on me and after the initial taste I already loved it. This is highly drinkable and am going to run out and get another one or two tomorrow to cellar for a while. I previously tried an American Wild Ale which I loathed (extremely vinegary) and was afraid to open this up because of how expensive it was and for the fear I would not like it (though I would have forced myself to drink it). I was pleasantly surprised and am going to go get some of the cheeses and crackers out of my fridge right after I post this to pair it up with them and see what goes well with it. A very drinkable drink! 1,746 charactersSpdKilz, Aug 29, 2009

A: Huge pop of the cork. Pours a dark yellow to light copper. Head is bright white with small tight bubbles. Lacing webs the side of the glass on the initial pour. 
S: Apple, cherry, light funk and huge sour nose. Nothing disappointing on this glass. 
M/T: Puckering sour on the first taste, followed by a huge rush of cherry, lemon and apple on the second wave. Finishes very dry and refreshing. A punch to the mouth with flavor. 
D: This is my favorite beer of the year. I could drink this every night. There is nothing that is obnoxious about this beer. Big nose, huge taste and dry finishing. The lemon could make you reflux after a while, but other than that, flawless. 696 charactersDrewOSU, Aug 29, 2009
4.26/5  rDev -3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750ml 2009 bottle received in a recent trade.
Appearance: Gorgeous frosted lemon body with a luciously frothy 2 finger white crown. Tons of retention and lacing. Seriously sexy!
Smell: Extremely nice mixture of tart lemon notes, pronounced brett, white wine / green grapes, and a hint of oak. I'm even getting a slightly smokey charred note from the barrel.
Taste: This ones opens with a nice tartness and continues on to show its grape / wine barrel quality, then finishes with a beautifully dry lemon drop tartness. This is so nice and sour with brett woven seemlessly in between the sour notes! This is seriously well crafted and I'm in awe of the brewmasters talent. Puts fresh Cuvee De Castleton to shame!
Mouthfeel: Light bodied and well carbonated but lacks a nice crispness or a nice softness!
Drinkability: Oh this one is acidic enough to limit my intake but its delicious every sip of the way.
Russian River is by far my favorite Brewery!

4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle purchased at the Frontier Saloon (!) in Folsom. Surprised to see it there but very happy nonetheless!
Appearance- Pours a nice light golden color with a fair amount of carbonation and about a finger of very white head. Head fizzes for a bit and then dies down to a ring, with very little lacing left as I drink.
Smell- Mmm, very tart, vinous, and lactic. Lots of green apple and citrus backed up with a bit of grain and funk. Very much what I like in the nose of a wild ale or gueuze like this. Anticipating a biting tartness.
Taste- Very tart up front but not quite as much so as I was expecting. Rather than the tartness of granny smith apples, it is much more along the lines of a green grape tartness. Funk is present, but also more subdued than I was expecting. A touch of grain again as well behind the tart flavors. Much more subtle than I was expecting and less of a kick in the mouth but perhaps even better as a result.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Both of these are great on this better. Just the right level of carbonation and not overly thin despite the style. The tartness isn't mouth destroying either and really keeps you coming back for more. Excellent.
Overall, great offering from Russian River as usual. Had this one fresh and have another for aging. Look forward to seeing what happens to this one in the future. Highly recommended. 1,360 charactersboatshoes, Aug 26, 2009

A-Pours a clear gold, with a very small white head and no lacing.
S-Moderately funky with some barnyard and vinegar; maybe a bit of a peppery hop also.
T-A rather subdued barnyard funk with some light phenolics. Just a bit sour, I will hope for more over time.
M-Light bodied, crisp and fairly dry.
D-As the sourness is not fully developed (or maybe this batch is designed to be less sour), it is quite easy drinking, even sessionable, for the style.

4.14/5  rDev -6.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Batch 004 on tap yesterday at Teresa's Next Door. I loved all the previous batches, and was looking forward to revisiting this batch as my previous experience with it was a little disappointing, which I'd attributed to my inebriation
A: Clear straw yellow with no head. Some carbonation is visible
S: Bretty, musty, barnyardy and woody. Vinous and grape character is present. The balance is excellent. As it warms up, a buttery Chardonnay character comes through
T: Opens sour with a clean lactic character before a vinous, grape-like character kicks in with a mild vanilla/oak character. Finishes tart and grapey. Good stuff
M: Light, crisp and refreshing. Excellent finihs
D: While not as enjoyable as previous batches, I enjoyed this and look forward to revisiting it with some time on it.
**Edit 22 March 2013**
My last bottle of batch 004. Le Sigh.
The brightness, the zest, and the vivaciousness are gone, but this beer is still a work of art. Beautiful chardonnay character with a perfect blend of soft, grass/hay Brett notes, though the wine is a little more dominant now. Verjus and mild spice. The palate is similar, though the finish is just a little thin, a touch watery. Beautiful lactic palate, well balanced with wine and Brett notes. This just might have been the best batch of Temptation ever. 4.5/4.5/4.5 1,329 charactersDefenCorps, Aug 24, 2009

aroma is vinous, with a vinegar like sweetnesss, a bit subtle, with notes of grapes, a bit of pale malts and some sour apple. phenomenal in the nose.
taste is more of the same with a wonderful vinegar sourness and a great semi-dry character. the fruit and malt dance behind the sourness on the palate. excellent!
mouthfeel is semi-dru and light bodied without any overtly-sweet note that tends to plague beers similar to this one. very refreshing and wonderful on the palate.
drinkability is perfect. mildly sour, refreshing and supremely drinkable. a great summer beer with a refreshing quality. cheers! 727 charactersbotham, Aug 20, 2009

Large bubbles break quickly forming a thin cap. Smells tart (green apple) and oaky. Big tart punch up front (lemon, green apple) with an oaky finish. Very much like a chardonnay with carbonation. Very well carbonated in fact and feels very light in the mouth from it. Very easy drinking as well. Delicious! 402 characterssrroos, Aug 20, 2009

Arrived cloudy and hazy, bit of white frothy head.
Funky stanky horsey fizzy aroma, the animal farm is busting out....reserved, not boisterous
Very balanced right now even though it is young, which means it should be more complex with some more time on the bugs. 
White wine flavors very apparent. A bit sour, not puckering. I would like it a bit more sour, again....needs a bit more time. I find this one drinks a little more smoother than the 003 did at the same time. Some lemon, some green apple, citrus, very little malt. Bit of tartness as the glass goes down. Nice body, well carbed...almost like The Bubbly. 
Pretty tasty, goes down well. Lacks a bit of the boldness of the other Russian River sours, but that is its niche - subtle complexity. I think 003 was a bit rough for the first 6 months and mellowed. The 004 seems fairly smooth, so it will be interesting to see how it ages. 964 charactersmrkrispy, Aug 19, 2009

A: Golden/ yellow in color, slightly hazy, with a 1/2 finger white head that sticks around and leaves a nice lacing.
S: Complex as it warms up. The wet cardboard of brett is there, along with assertive lemon, green apple, white pepper, vanilla, and a touch of caramel. Projected, but without volatility. Do not get any whiff of alcohol. After the glass was empty, there was a distinct scent of empty chardonnay barrels (all that dead yeast, tartrate crystals, oxidized wine... which I recall from my days working in the winery when I cleaned chardonnay barrels after bottling).
T: Tart and puckery, with lemon, green apple, vanilla, wood, and slight malt. Long on the finish. Not heavy.
M: Medium body. Linear on the palate but the flavors are easy to pick out through the moderate carbonation and acidity. 
D: Easy down the gullet for a beer of such character and complexity.
Glad I got to try this. Quite unique. 984 charactersnectar14, Aug 19, 2009

A - A finger of persistent egg-white foam with big bubbles. Opaque golden orange colored body, and nice lacing that sticks around. I suspect the appearance was hurt a little bit by the glass type.
S - Awesome aroma - wonderful blend of unripened green apples, horsey funk and mustiness, white wine and green grapes, light oakiness, and some other light fruit and spice notes.
T - Starts with graham crackery sweetness that morphes into a light sour finish that is surprisingly clean. Funk and unripened fruits predominate the complementary flavors. Excellent, but not quite as rich and complex as the aroma.
M - Dry finish, lively champagne-like carbonation that still imparts a soft texture. Some residual dry stickiness and cottonmouth sensations.
D - There is nary a trace of the 7.25% ABV - this could easily be a 4-5% geuze. It's actually a little reminscent of Deviation, but without the aggressive Beatification PH001 tartness element. However, it's also significantly cheaper... 1,071 charactersMasterSki, Aug 18, 2009

A - Hazy pale golden body with virtually no carbonation and a sturdy white, creamy head that retained very well and left moderate lace around the glass. 
S - Slight band-aid notes with a sour funk, but not over-the-top at all. Surprisingly, there are also hints of citrus rind and bitter hop notes. Plenty of oaky character as well with a contrasting green apple sourness.
T - Really defined sour green apple flavor with a tart character and lots of oaky, woody tannins. A hint of earthy bitterness emerges in the finish, accompanied by even more tart notes. 
M - Medium bodied with a syrupy texture and very dry, tart finish with plenty of sourness and astringency on the palate.
D - Fantastic sour ale... perhaps one of my new favorites! Really tasty and nicely done Wild Ale that doesn't totaly wreck the palate or melt the tastebuds. I think I enjoyed this even more than Consecration. 930 charactersffejherb, Aug 17, 2009
2.66/5  rDev -39.7%look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5On tap at Falling Rock:
Well, I like RR beers and the Temptation is a nice beer. However, while it produces a nice looking brew, and it's not horrible or bad, it's simply just a sour beer.
The taste has a touch of green pear to it, but for the most part this is only sour. Nothing complex, and I"m glad I had this on tap instead of paying the 24 bucks for a bottle. 
Aroma is sour, with bits of clove and green apple. That's as far as it goes, though. Aged? sure doesn't come out in the aroma or taste.
A solid sour, but nothing special. I would think it's not worth the bottle price. 585 charactersMebuzzard, Aug 16, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From last nights notes. 750ml corked and caged bottle poured into a tulip. Batch 00473
Body is a fairly clean golden color with a slight haze. A robust pour creates a very good cream colered head, especially for the style. Carbonation appears to die down pretty quickly bringing the head down with it.
Aromas are funky, woody, and tart at first followed by very sour bread and dry white wine. A fair amount of citrus there but specifically citrus juice not the fruit or peel like I often mean in reviews. Lime then lemon.
Flavors are similar to the smell but even drier. Approaches the palate much like other, more, agressive, wild ales do causing me to anticipate a sour bacterial blood bath but somehow finishes like very clean yet dry white wine. Funkier than I expected, in a good way, but still extremely approachable. A great showcase for the sour and funky flavors in a package that even someone new to the style can appreciate. As this one warms (reaches wine drinking temperature?) it starts drinking much more like a wine than a wild beer. 
Medium bodied, the carb I thought had died is still very much there on the feel complimenting the slight dry character. Extremely drinkable for the complexity. It took a lot of effort just to keep myself from gulping this down.
Overall another amazing beer. RR never ceases to amaze me. I'm going to pick up a few more of these ASAP. 1,389 charactersberkey, Aug 16, 2009

Frothy covering all surface area. Mild horse blanket, lemon rind, butter, vinous, and oak. I enjoy the balance in smell. I don't like when horse blanket dominates the nose. Taste is dry that fades quickly with little taste on the finish besides oak. The biggest taste is noticed at first sip with lemon and wine notes. I think this needs more time. A bitterness is also detected on the finish that wouldn't be so detectable if there were a sweetness to counter it. Beer is well carbonated leaving a good mouthfeel. A LOT of oak in this one. 635 characterscarps12, Aug 15, 2009

A- very cloudy golden yellow straw with a white foamy head into a stemed tulip. 
S- A very nice sour apple, lemon and pear, oak,
T- Very complex. Again, sour tart apple, lemon, pear oak, also a little spice, white wine like, and a hint of mandarin orange. A little biscut/bread like. Surprisingly really balanced sourness and sweetness with a good amount of bitterness at the end. Not overly sour, not very funky or anything. I think a good amount of the sourness comes from the brett.
M- Very champagne like mouthfeel. Great carbonation (Bottle sure popped of it!). crisp, yet bitter finish.
D- Extremely drinkable sour and very balanced. Surprisingly very smooth too. Almost not as sour as I would have hoped for a RR wild ale, but luckily this fits a niche of a very drinkable wild ale 964 charactersmikedashg, Aug 13, 2009

Appearance: Slightly cloudy straw. Little to no head (probably due to up-to-the-rim pour). Decent lacing.
Smell: Strong oak overtones. Sour fruit with tones of apple, white grapes and lemon.
Taste: Dry with moderate to extra tart sourness. Tones of sour fruit and lemon. I am definitely picking up the Chardonnay. After taste is sour apple with slight corn/grain. The tart resonates on the palate for a good while.
Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation with a light body.
Drinkability: It's a sipper but surprising drinkable.
Very refreshing on a warm day. 654 characterskbm, Aug 13, 2009

A - Pours a beautiful yellow color with a nice amount of carbonation. Creamy white head billows up from my tulip glass.
S - Delightful and somewhat expected from the vast amount of reviews on this beer. A slightly tart smell of brett and white grapes rises up to meet you. Not a nose puckering sourness for sure, just a slightly tart sensation.
T - Again, not the biggest sour fan so the fact that this beer does not overpower you made it very appealing to me. Tastes like a nice champagne is the best way that I can put it. Nice flavors of the white grapes and tart fruit. 
M - Crisp, clear, and delightful
D - I drank more of the 750ml bottle than my wife so it drinks well, although this style is simply not my preferred. Splitting the 750ml and having the larger portion of the bottle was more than sufficient for me.
I liked this very much and went out and picked up another bottle before it vanishes from the shelves. Living in PA, the RR bottles show up infrequently (Damnation, Consecration, and now Temptation) so I picked one up to ensure that I could enjoy again later. Like I said, if you want to try a sour and are not the biggest fan, then seek this one out and give it a try. I think you will enjoy it. 1,421 charactersBeerisheaven, Aug 12, 2009

Smells of the expected funk and sour, lemon funk.
I can definitely taste the oak and barrel in this one. The lemon zest sourness and mild funk is prevelant, but the barrel is the biggest part.

A- Pours a radiant golden, straw yellow. Produced three fingers width of white head. Left some lacing as the beer was consumed.
S- If there was one aspect of this beer that wasn't the greatest this would be it. The brett is definitely at the forefront and creates a distinctive musty aroma. Given a swirl the oak comes forward along with distant smell of white grapes. Just a little too mellow and one dimensional for my liking. 
T- The taste on this one just got better and better over time. Upfront a unique, white grape juice flavor kicks in...sweet and fruity. As the taste progresses, the beer becomes more sour and is cut off by brett and oak flavors. The beer finishes with a nice white grape tartness.
M- Light to medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Leaves a semi-dry feel on the palate.
D- Insanely drinkable...a tribute to the wine-like characteristics this beer had. I drank a 750 mL bottle with ease. Did I mention that the alcohol is virtually undetectable? 
Overall, at first I wasn't too sure about this one. However, the flavors really came through over time. Truly does take on chardonnay charactersitics and is quite the delight. Hopefully I can land a few more bottles of this. 1,325 charactersrhinos00, Aug 11, 2009

This is a great sour offering from Russian River. Pours a bright yellow color, hazy, with a foamy head. 
The beer is delicious, with a bright sourness trailing into a mild grapefruit-like bitterness, eventually resolving into a light butterscotch flavor. 
It's got a nice carbonation which seems to move the sourness around the mouth. I could drink a couple of these. Sadly, it's just about done on tap at FO; luckily I have a couple bottles tucked away for a sunny day. 516 charactersrealmpel, Aug 11, 2009

A: A nice golden hue with a big frothy 1-inch head...almost has a musky hefeweizen appearance. The only knock on the beer is the minimal lacing and head retention. Even with the lack of head retention, I was still able to re-create that initial 1-inch head with a heavy swirl or two. 
S: Basically all tart sourness! A little bit of banana and perhaps green apple. 
T: My first impression...SMOOOOTH! Robust tart sourness that seems to be prominent, but also subdued at the same time or balanced...whatever floats your boat. That blonde malt character also comes through a bit more, but again, the balance of sour and malt is superb. I also get a slight woody/oak in the middle and end of this beer. 
M: Perfect carbonation and light on the palate...what you look for within the AWA style. 
D: This is the perfect "session" beer! Several things are going on...and would pair nicely with BBQ or fish. I could literally drink this whole bottle within 30 minutes! Perfect!
Overall: If I were to rate this beer among the other RR sours, I would have to say..so far..that Supplication comes in first....followed by this and Consecration. A must try. Cheers! 1,243 charactersOlieIPA, Aug 10, 2009

M: High carbonation, and fairly heavy body.
D: Didn't end up finishing mine, but mainly because I had just come from a day of wine tasting. But one of the more drinkable of the sours that I've had, probably because it starts from a blonde ale. 545 characterslhaqq, Aug 08, 2009

Aroma of lemon zest, vinegar, oak. Or maybe it's is just really sour cherry? Spice? A little sweetness too. Each time I smell this beer I pick up something different.
Layered flavors: sour brettiness, citrus, oak, a little alcohol on the finish. Nice complexity; not just a one trick pony that wallops you over the head with sourness. Full bodied with moderate carbonation that is amplified by the sourness. Hits all of the taste sensations.
Very quaffable until the heartburn/sour stomach kicks in. The 7.25% abv is nicely integrated.
This beer doesn't get the hype that Beat and Supp get, but is just as good or better. 685 charactersJRhode, Aug 07, 2009

Temptation is an opaque dark yellow to light golden. A small white head results from the pour and sticks around as a cap to accompany me on this sour adventure. Aromas are solidly funky and acidic. I wish there were more words to describe it all! Flavors are incredibly sour, and there is a heavy puckering effect on the sides of my tongue. The sourest of granny smith apples and white grapes/Riesling are very apparent. High carbonation brings out the tart flavors even more. It is a tongue tickler, without a doubt.

On this hot summer day I elected to pour this straw gold ale with an obstinance to clarity. As the beer rose within it developed a strong cotton like foamy white head that as it receded left an angry tattered curtain within the glass. 
The nose of this was sharp and dry with recognition given to the lemon and grapefruit citrus zest, complimented beautifully by the oak and green apple character. 
The mouth on this beer is medium with essences of grapefruit, lemon, green apple, pear all blanketed in a nice biscuit spreading. 
A wonderfully designed and prepared beer and will definitely go well with some blue cheese or maybe even a nice salmon fresh picked out of the ocean.

A: Pale straw-yellow body.. hazy, lively carbonation... half inch white head quickly subsides to a healthy skim... sheets of lacing are left behind.
S: Green apples, tartness, pear, oak... very nice... the brett and the barrels both come through here
T: Excellent! Much like the nose the tart green apples and pears dominate while an undercurrent of oak ... actually, this was reminiscent of the superior saison, fantome!
M: Smooth, relatively light body... massive tart finish lingers on the tongue before fading... great carbonation levels
D: Considering how tart this was, it was very drinkable... quite enjoyable and worth every penny. 696 characterscallmemickey, Aug 02, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Deliciously dry, complex sour. Temptation pours a bright yellow gold color with a wonderful blanket of fine bubbles. The bubbles stick around for a long time, too. The aroma is vinous with apples and a healthy dose of oak. There are some floral hops and the malt comes through a bit, too. The brett character is blends exceptionally well with the rest of the aromas. The flavor is wonderfully dry and oaky. There are a different fruit flavors layered throughout the beer. The best thing, though, is that the flavor stays full and round from the first taste to the finish. The brett, oak and fruit all come together. The sourness is restrained but still exerts some pucker. It's just a really good beer. 702 characterspopery, Aug 01, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Side-by-side review of Batch 04 (750ml) and 03 (375ml).
A: Deep amber color, a little bit cloudy (bottle probably a bit too agitated). Minimal head and lacing. Not much difference between the two.
S: The 04 is bright and tart in the nose, up-front fruits. The 03 is a mellower aroma, but somehow richer and perhaps with a bit of honey. Chardonnay influence is easily appreciated in both bottles.
T/M/D: The 04 is lively and tart. Opens with a good hit of sourness, finishes dry and oaky. The 03 sourness is not as sharp, and is accompanied by a distinct honey sweetness. The 03 finishes similarly dry to the 04, but persists longer with Chardonnay and oak flavors lingering.
Both are supremely easy to drink, and showcase RR's excellence at blending wine flavors with fantastic beers. Definitely looking forward to aging this Batch 04, and wondering when I'll decide to open my last Batch 03. 896 charactersk3n, Aug 01, 2009

Bretanomyces nose is assertive, as are lemon, unripe pears and green apples. Lacto yeast also gives a pleasant "sour milk/yogurt" nose. 
Mouthfeel is fresh and thin but this brew is sufficiently flavorful and tart as to make the thinner, cleaner mouthfeel desireable. Creaminess and a heavier or thicker mouth would be a fault in this beer.
Tart, citric and green apple flavors highlighted by the fresh, clean mouth. Layers of flavors of citrus, apples, pears and lime. Balanced, layered, complex, elegant and sophisticated. Nose grows more wine like of chardonnay; somewhat "white burgundian" in character, as do the flavors grow in chardonnay and white burgundy flavors as you drink it, especially in the back palate and finish. 
Bret and lacto very noticeable and the characteristics are nice. Lacto comes out in the mid to back palate and finish as you drink it. ("Sour milk" character in a good, not a bad way). Very drinkable, pleasant. 
Oak barrels finally come out in the nose and mouth after several minutes in the glass. Really nice and worth the wait. Complex! 1,150 charactersGRG1313, Jul 28, 2009

Funky, grainy, and tart lemon aroma. The flavor was a pretty straight-forward tart lemon with light grainy malt and light oaky vinous character. Some age seems to have smoothed this out, though I can't say that I've had it right after release. Medium-light body with medium carbonation. More mellow and drinkable than I was expecting actually. Very nice stuff. 477 charactersbulletrain76, Jul 25, 2009

Very persistent and sticky. Smells lactic and citric, with a lot of light fruit. Plenty of barnyard character. Tastes quite sour, again with plenty of citrus going hand-in-hand with the lactic acid. Incredibly strong oak character with some musty brett notes. Noticeable bitterness leads to an extremely dry finish. Medium-bodied and very effervescent. Very drinkable for what it is. One of the most complex, refined beers I've had. 529 charactersphilipquarles, Jul 21, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5As you pop the top on this one, the fog rolls out and carries with it a tart oak aroma.
Thick fluffy off white head reaches three fingers and turns rocky as it slowly fades. Lots of dots are left as lace. Body is a golden straw haze. Nose is absolutely penetrating as the yeast carries the sour funk like menthol. With first sip you are shown how the yeast really drives this beer. Lemon zest and cherry pits are at the heart of the sour feel that sits fat on the middle of the tongue. The tart feel is not big, it carries noticeable minerals and seems to be mellowed nicely by the oak. A nice orange, grapefruit rind sour feel stays on the back of the tongue and creates the mouthfeel. Very Chardonnay like drinkable. 719 charactersSPLITGRIN, Jun 16, 2009

A - Pours golden in color with a fluffy white head that leaves a ton of sticky lacing behind. Lots of white fizzy bubbles remain along the top of the beer and along the edge of the glass.
S - Funky, sour, tart, and fruity. Not as "wild" as the Supplication or Consecration, but based upon the reviews and talk, I expected this to be less of a wild compared to other offerings by Russian River.
T - A really nice blend of fruity and tart/sour with a nice oaky finish. Actually, a little more wild then I would have expected, based on the nose. 
M - Light in body. A dry, champagne-like, finish. A very crisp beer that is refreshing as well. Lots of nice fizzy carbonation, perfect.
D - A super-drinkable wild. Even more so the the Supplication and Consecration, because it's a little less "wild" and a little more "tame". This is my only bottle, must find/buy/trade for more. 1,004 charactersSean9689, Jun 10, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch #003
Temptation is very hazy and is radiant gold in color. Looks like pure sunshine with a little backlighting. Carbonation looks to be very active. It yields a foamy white head that stands over three fingers tall. Retention is nothing short of excellent. Waves of thick, sticky lace cling to the glass. Temptation is simply stunning to look at and is....well....very tempting. I can't imagine this being improved in any way.
The nose is very musky, earthy, and funky initially. A healthy infusion of Brett is very clear from the first whiff. A certain level of sourness is appreciated, but it doesn't smell overly sour at all. I certainly appreciate and like sour beer, but not when it's overly sour. Very positive sign there. Apple and pear fruity aromas are abundant. It smells a little sweet. Oak is prominent and adds a boatload of character. I'm anxious to find out how it impacted the flavor. This stuff smells excellent.
Wow! The first sip strongly suggests that this will be the finest experience I've had with an American Wild Ale to date. Apple and pear flavors are prevalent up front. They're very flavorful and have a bit of a white wine thing going. It is musky, funky, and has an impressive sour flavor that's only moderately intense. This is about as good as it gets for me in the sour world. Brett works absolute wonders here. It's delicious and not overly intense. The oak flavor is the cherry on top. It complements the other flavors tremendously. Despite the negative connotation, Temptation has loads of brilliant character. This is delicious stuff. Alcohol is masked extremely well and goes unnoticed. It finishes a little sour and funky. I'm really close to awarding a perfect score for flavor, but I just don't love it quite that much. I can't understate how close it is. 
Temptation has a medium body that's very creamy and smooth. I'm frankly stunned at how smooth it is given the high carbonation. Somehow the bubbles seem light and subtle. Very impressive. Drinkability is very high for this stuff. The flavor is simply delicious and each drink invites another. This 375 is disappearing far too quickly. I only wish I had a few more. 
Russian River is an amazing brewery. Everything that comes out of there is so impressive. I never imagined an American brewery crafting Belgian styles that actually rivaled (and often surpassed) authentic Belgians. But, they pull it off. Temptation is damn delicious. It's very refined and absolutely crammed with depth and character. But, it's not too bold and goes down like a dream. Personally, I believe this one's a little better than Supplication and Beatification. Not much, but enough to distinguish itself. If I could award tenths of points, the flavor would score better than a '4.5.' I've had this bottle for over a year now. I can't imagine the flavor's gotten worse. It's too good. But, it's held up incredibly well over that period of time. If you haven't been tempted enough to seek this out yet, you should do yourself a favor and do it. It's sinfully good. 3,047 charactersprototypic, May 24, 2009

A - Golden orange with a huge foamy white cap. Excellent retention and huge, chunky lacing on the glass.
S - Very saison like in the aroma. Hints of barnyward and lots of sour fruits. CHerries are the dominant. A little lemon zest mixed in as well. Excellent aroma.
T - Sour and acidic up front. Some lemon and a faint grassiness. Sour apples as well. An excellent array of sour fruit flavors. A light spiciness as well that melds well with the sour fruits.
M/D - Crisp, clean and refreshing. Medium bodied with a velvety smooth feel. Excellent carbonation and ridiculously easy drinking. 655 charactersckeegan04, May 18, 2009

3.7/5  rDev -16.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Poured into my Russian River "TION" snifter, carefully off the of the yeast, which I'm saving for a wild ale I'm brewing right now. Temptation is cloudy gold with an huge, fluffy white head with nice rocky last that leaves massive chunks of lace.
Smell is a on the sweeter side, lemons and a bit floral. Nice pithy dryness too, really reminds me of a saison, especially as it warms, really nice. 
Taste is on the softer side, the chardonnay definitely comes through, a nice clean malty sweetness and some fruity Belgian esters. Not much sourness or even barnyard funk though. I just had a Cascade The Vine, their muscat grape barrel aged sour, and wanted to compare them, but they're really night and day. Tempation is much softer, basically just a wine barrel aged BPA. Not really sour at all, more wine notes too. Good though, but I wanted more funk. 
Mouthfeel is a bit too tannic for me, some drying alcohol, very chardonnay like there, save for the soft, creamy carbonation. 
Drinkability is pretty good, a nice beer, but a bit of a disappointment in regards to my mood and expectations. I wanted a sour, and this one is really just a wine barrel blonde. But good for that for sure. And the price was stupid high, which was the final nail... 1,250 charactersccrida, May 02, 2009

Pours cloudy apricot, with an irrepressible 2-finger fluffy white head that settles into a nice, dense cap. Solid lacing. 
Smell is world class. Prominent funky barnyard and horseblanket mixes it up with nice lemony citrus and vanilla notes, with a subtle chardonnay presence underneath. Some minerals and a bit of alcohol round out the nose.
Taste is gorgeous. Tart and dry up front, with more white wine notes than you get in the nose; lemon-lime citrus, horseblanket, crisp. Finish starts off super clean, with notes of barnyard, citrus, soft white wine, oak, surfacing a bit after the swallow and hanging around, still get just a hint of dry, leafy hops at the very end. Just so complex. 
Mouthfeel is light, crisp, dry. 
Drinkability is very nice. Feel so lucky to have scored a bottle of this particular batch, just a great beer with so much complexity. 975 charactersJohnQVegas, Apr 25, 2009

Pour is just fantastic. Insane head with perfect lacing over a murky golden liquid.
Smells of tart lemons, some other fruits, and a vinegary sourness.
Tastes just great, lemon zest, sour apple, a little wood. Another amazing beer from Russian River.

4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75375 ml bottle courtesy of Floydster. Batch 003. Thanks for the opportunity to try this beer..one of the priorities on my wants list! Poured into my snifter.
A- Body is a translucent golden yellow color. Pours with a solid 2-3 finger foamy white head. Leaves a lot of lacing behind in the glass and some film. When held up to the light one can see that this brew is uniform in cloudiness.
S-Nose is definitely there-but much softer than other sours I have experiences. The main characters are sour and salty-which I guess can be associated with vinegar-but I am getting more of an acidic sourness associated with a saltiness independent of that. Behind this all is a subtle sweetness that balances it all out.
T-Taste upfront is somewhat subtle and offers some tartness but there is enough of a presence of oak and granny smith apple (both tart and sweet components) flavors in the background to balance it out. The tartness comes trough some more for the finish but it is never unbearable or extreme in any way as there are some oaky characteristics that comes through as well. The finish is very clean as nothing lingers on the palate unless you lick your lips and get the moderately tart experience all over again... but I would not describe it as dry...because though there is a slight alcohol warmth it doesn't hinder the beer's taste.
M-Low to medium carbonation and body that has yeasty, phenolic, acidic, salty, dry, and moist components (hard to explain but something one needs to experience).
D- This is an awesome sour/American Wild Ale by Russian River and something that I wish I would have had as a precursor to Deviation, Issabelle, and Beatification as those were all much more tart than this brew. A 375 ml serving of this is perfect and offers a lot of complexity and a great tasting experience. Russian River clearly does a great job with their sours and this one is a very balanced one. This is in its current state, IMO, the perfect introduction to sours. 1,980 charactersPittBeerGirl, Mar 14, 2009

Poured into my "TION" glass. Pours a very nice semi cloudy light honey color with a very nice white head that sticks all over the glass.
Smell is great. Lots of bret funk with some wine and oaky characteristics. Smells semi sweet too.
Taste is wonderful. Nice and crisp sourness with a smooth oakyness. The malt lends a certain sweet character that is wonderful.

Uncorks with a massive "thok". No gush, fortunately. Slightly cloudy with a little disturbed sediment, a nice yellow gold colour, with a wonderful thick head. Excellent lacing. Looks great.
Nose is redolent of white wine, massive oakiness and light sour overtones of must and fermentation. So much oak though - I love it. Deep and earthy, but with lighter fruitier notes shining through. Cherries, citrus and kaffir lime. Great. Just great.
Taste is huge, with a massive tongue-slicing of organic acidity. Green apples, young sauvignon blanc grapes, even tending towards the sourness of lemons and limes. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and full, lending some gravitas to the enormous spike of puckering acidity.
What an amazingly flavoursome beer. It sure packs a punch; easily as good as some of the Belgian Geuezes I've had the pleasure to try.
Amazingly drinkable and refreshing with a quite incredibly powerful taste profile. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 1,074 characterslacqueredmouse, Feb 13, 2009

4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5An eccentric corked and caged, 12.7 ounce bottle. Batch 003.
Canary yellow with a golden brass glossing. The beer is both lambent and radiantly clear despite its light haze. It's much darker than champagne, but otherwise shares an awful lot of resemblance. A milky blanket of lace comes to overlay the glass. This because an immaculately pristine capping of whipped mousse lay bountiful with an almost dizzying steadfast stream of determinant, hyperactive bubbles that maintain its perfect physique. 
The smell of long over-ripened fruits, time-tested French oak, fresh baked bread, the rich yet delicate scent of Chardonnay grapes and a maturing strain of Brettanomyces makes for an aroma as pleasant and complex and unique as any drink is capable of possessing. The character of Chardonnay grapes add lush, ripe, fleshy and almost buttery qualities. It prickles the nose like champagne. I never knew there could be such a wonderful smell. 
Still relatively young, the Brett is only starting to impart its notes of earthiness, barnyard and just a hint of singeing smoke. The contribution to taste is noted as well although still not yet more pronounced than the effects of the barrel. The oak itself plays a relatively minor part although it's imparted so much lush, buttery, lightly fruity flavours from the Chardonnay. Drinking this beer puts you right in a Grand Cru vineyard of Burgundy. 
Especially with the Brett continuing to develop the most lucrative and unique of barnyard flavours, what people taste in the beer could be a highly subjective thing. Apart from the unbelievably strong resemblance to white wine and Champagne, I'm also picking up on all kinds of lightly suggestive fruity notes. These would include stone fruits (apple, pear), citric fruits (lemon, lime), and tropical fruits (mango, kiwi). 
The mouthfeel is light but sharp and acidic. Although a mere 27 IBU's there is plenty of (almost puckering) tartness to take the place of bitterness. At times, the beer can also be rather oaky and buttery. A slightly higher alcohol percentage never factors into what is an absolutely sociable drink. The yeasty bread quality is never lost and the wild yeast continues to turn up with new - even more funky - notes when the beer's allowed to warm. 
It's absolutely incredible what 17 months in a used Chardonnay barrel and a strain of wild yeast will do. This is certainly starting to come into its own after almost exactly a year since bottling. Oh how I wish I had more! Russian River's Temptation is a study in contradictions: it's so tremendously enjoyable - a light bodied, tart, highly sociable drink - and yet it also happens to be one of the most delicately intricate examples of brewing artwork. 2,727 charactersbiegaman, Feb 06, 2009

I've had this in bottle (batch 003) on several occasions, and found that I didn't enjoy it on tap as much.

Cork comes off explosively. An aggressive pour produced a ton of white fluffy head. Color is yellowish tan with champagne like heavy carbonation. The smell of apple and chardonnay are amazing. Also the malts smell of tree bark. Smells kind of like a musky white wine. The taste of wine is the first thing that went through my head. Makes my cheeks tingle upon swallowing. Taste is also similar to the smell: apples and chardonnay. Doesn't really wonder on my tongue but maybe its not supposed to? Mouthfeel is great: heavily carbonated with a lighter body. Drinkablility is good. Just like champagne, I'm not so sure that I'd want to drink more than one bottle (unless it were new years eve).
Overall, a very well crafted beer. Russian River definitely broke the mold with this one. 837 charactersBeerStine, Feb 02, 2009

Really very delicious nose. Champagne characters with a slight sour fruit element but a lot of pleasant grapey aromas. Slight hint of a tang, not quite sherbety but sherbety is the closest I can come, linguistically.
Wow. And...wow. Okay, that taste really surprised the arse off of me. (If I'd known what this was, perhaps not quite as much, but still) Very, very mouth-puckering sour palate, but yes I was dead right about the tang because there it is loud and clear. It's very citrusy really, like lemon squash that's leant too heavily on the lemon. At the same time, a very rich, robust mid-palate, rather (I'd say) champagney again. Like the tang on the nose, it's kind of like poorly-hidden alcohol, only without the alcohol intensity. Just a rich billowy palate, like a cloud of octopus ink. Full marks, beer, for the surprise factor. And a fascinating palate to boot. 
Not an everyday chugalug beer but an interesting, bold palate that grabs you by the balls and spits in your face "I am an interesting, bold palate." Mouthfeel is very puckering. I feel it killing my tastebuds with its acidity. 1,330 characterslaituegonflable, Jan 13, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375 mL champagne bottle from Monk's, batch 003. 
Pours straw-colored and slightly cloudy with two fingers of fluffy white carbonation that hangs around and even leaves a little lacing. I don't remember Supplication or Compunction having this kind of head retention. Carbonation is champagne-fine. 
The aroma is sour, with vinegar notes just shy of compunction over the kind of complex background I've come to expect from these RR wild ales. There's apple cider and funk from the Brett, along with some wood and vanilla, and even a little citrus. 
Tastes like it smells, opening up with lip-smacking acidity. Mixed citrus comes in mid-palate, with a character much more similar to Chardonnay than to hop-derived citrics. Some very light vanilla and bitterness in the finish, but oak and hops are definitely not the main event. Of the Russian River sour beers I've had, this is by far the most winelike, which works well with the heavy acidity. The balance is perfect.
Drinkability is phenomenal. In a world without heartburn, I could drink a case of this. 1,058 characterskajerm, Dec 29, 2008
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Jh1982 for the generous trade. Really anxious to try this, Cheers to my first Russian River experience.
A Hazy light yellow color, with a bleach white head similar to the head of a champagne. Head lasts the entire glass. Tons of activity, as carbonation comes rushes up the body of this elegant looking beer. 
S As my sniffer closes in, I get a whiff of puckering green apple blended nicely with lemon, dry but flavorful white grape, and brett. Smells almost like a dry and sweet white wine, really pleasing.
T Mouth watering fresh lemon right from the start, the Sour tag is more then deserving. As the sourness wears it provides a great entry into white grapes and apple tastes, as foreseen in the scent. Incredibly acidic and fairly bitter, which leads to a lighter loftier taste. This would be perfect on a hot summer day. 843 charactersCoolJosh, Dec 26, 2008
4.48/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My 600th review!!! Thanks to 011x0110 for this bottle.
Batch #003, corked and caged 12.7oz bottle. Poured into a Lost Abbey chalice. Emerges a dark golden color with a huge white head. The head is dense, foamy, rocky, and about three fingers in size. The lacing is unbelievable on this one as well. 
Aroma is fruity and sour. Peppery as well. A big dose of lemon rind is in the nose. Some barnyard aromas but nothing too acrid or sour. A large dose of yeast aroma. 
Puckeringly sour and tart. Slightly fruity but mostly the tartness and sourness come forward. A touch of lemon peel, some green pepper. Perhaps a touch of dry chardonnay near the finish. Not much oak or wine characteristics otherwise. 
My first American Wild Ale and will NOT be my last. I am really starting to love the sour and funky beers and this might the best yet. Carbonation is perfect. Finishes pretty dry and crisp. Mouth pucker at the end. So easy to drink. A real treat! 952 charactersSaCkErZ9, Dec 21, 2008

Flavor of oak (very similar to oak-barrel aged Captain Lawrence beers), sour gueuze-like notes, sour apples. The oak is present but not overpowering and balances nicely with the sour notes. Has a strong palate to mesh with the oak barrel. Nice finish. Excellent beer.

s - Acid. Which? Some funky, slight oak hints. Smells good. 
t - Mild sourness and oak is a strange mix. Tart but not super sour. It's really nice - RR does a great job. This is mild in terms of sourness and acid, but it has similar flavors. I do think Vinny has the best bugs.

12.70 oz. cork-caged bottle, poured into a tulip glass:
Opens with a loud "pop":
Pours golden with a large foamy white head that lasts, leaving foamy patches and broken rings of lacing.
The smell is sour/funky with yeasty breadiness and lemongrass.
The taste is sour and lemony - puckering. It has a vanilla/oak backing. Chardonnay comes through. Very wild/funky...barnyardy/musty. White wine character comes through as well. Finishes very dry.
Medium-bodied with carbonation giving an airy lightness.
A nice, well-done sipper. A power-house in the tart department. Very lemony and acidic, so as well-done as it is, it is a sipper - Try pairing with fish. 695 charactersjwc215, Dec 08, 2008

A: Murky pale yellow with a spritzy snowblind white head. The incredible rush of carbonation builds the head and leaves it lasting half the glass.
S: Tons of sour green apple and lemon mixture with tons of Brett and funk. Some slight white grapes and chardonnay scents are coming through as well.
T: Starts off like a lemon got squeezed into your mouth. Very sour up front, but then fades into more light grape and apple flavors. The initial flavors are very acidic and strong, while the latter flavors are more mild and light. Overall, incredibly tasty and refreshing.
This was my first "real" wild ale and it was incredible. Did it live up to my expectations? I'm not sure yet. But I know I want to try it again! 836 characterstreyrab, Dec 07, 2008

Woody with enormous amounts of brett character fruity, grapes, luscious pineapple, pear, starfruit, more oak with a hint of grape, Very nice.
Sour mouthpuckering delicous brett induced goodness. Tart as hell with great fruit character and more tartness. The aging on burgundian oak really shows through. So much apricot, pear, honey suckle, oak with oak tannins really drying up the finish. So tart delicoius and pallate clearing.

Pours a hazy golden color with medium head of foam. Retention is good, a thin layer of foam continues to float atop as the glass is drained. Big funky aroma, with musty, lemony, and horseblanket elements on the nose. Flavor shows excellent complexity, which to me is the key to a good sour beer. Brightly sour. Brett funkiness and oakiness are evident. Also has a luscious lemony/chardonnay note in the background that interplays nicely with the sourness.
Overall, an excellent sour beer and the best RR I've had. 615 charactersmarksto, Nov 27, 2008
4.05/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5So I'm learning to appreciate the sour side. I had this on tap once at Stone, but, uh, don't remember too much from that day except it was a great day of beer hopping with friends.
Pours a semi-opaque sunshine hue of gold. Lots of action here. Head is big bubbled, frothy, and pops a lot. Had a crappy pour because the cork shot out at Mach2 and the beer welled up and gushed forth.
Smell is mouth wateringly sour. You know exactly what you're in for.
Taste is sour. Surprise. Sour oranges mostly. I remember liking this at Stone now! The sourness isn't overbearing like some others of the style. Pleasant. Like 'sour lite.'
Mouthfeel is a little harsh, but not rude. Probably the most drinkable sour I've had, as the style in general is masochistic.
Overall: good awa 773 charactersPatronWizard, Nov 24, 2008

A - Sniftered. Pours a slightly hazed golden with a ton of fast-flowing bubbles. The head is quite large and tight. Lacing.
S - Holy wine-barrel batman. Massive amounts of oak, wine, sour white grapes, brett. Flowery and perfumey...spicey.
T - Really remarkable. Tartness, but not overdone. Major wine notes, yet still obviously a beer. Starts tart with sour grapes and apples, and melts into a cacophony of tiny nuances. Brett here. Oak here. Wine here. Lemon juice. Sour up front, and dry on the finish. 
M - Near champagne-like carbonation... very effervescent and crisp. Body is rather big for such a sparkly brew.
D - Wonderfully drinkable, and would be a joy in a 750.

Batch #003
A cloudy, golden body that has a bunch of fast moving carbonation bubbles. Slightly hazy, not translucent, but not completely opaque either. A big, thick white head that has very good retention and leaves thick, sticky lacing along the glass. A couple of yeast particles also float around in the beer.
Smells excellent. Lots of tartness in the aroma, along with a tart green apple smell. Chardonnay definitely comes through here, along with an oaky smell.
Taste, as usual, is very similar to the smell. Very tart up front with the Brett coming through. Pear and green apple are noticeable. Chardonnay and oak notes come through in the middle, followed by some more fruits and sourness toward the finish. Before the finish there are also some grassy notes that are noticeable. The aftertaste reminds me of the candy Warheads. A complex and great version of an American Wild Ale.
Mouthfeel is slightly puckering and a litle bit dry at the same time. Highly carbonated. After drinking for awhile makes the mouth feel like a very sour candy (warheads for example) would. Once again a kind of lasting dry, puckering feeling that makes the tongue feel like it is covered in ridges. Interesting.
This beer is excellent, and the drinkability is no exception. 1,475 charactersHojaminbag, Nov 19, 2008

S- Mild tart aroma. The intense brett smell that you find in the other RR sours is there, but more subtle. Notes of sweet grape and dry champagne are noted.
T- Moderate sourness. Brett and dry champagne along with the sweetness of fresh champagne grapes all balance one another.
M- Very crisp in spite of its sweetness.
D- Very drinkable for an American Wild. 422 charactersJoeMayo, Nov 11, 2008

4.59/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Nice straw body with a decent white head. It nearly murdered Aerozeppl as he opened it though. With the cage removed but the bottle sitting there UNTOUCHED on the table, the cork erupted out and drilled him directly in the forehead. Fortunately though, no beer was lost.
S: The aroma is funky with a good amount of apple. I love the funk on the nose.
T: A very firm tart flavor with some dry dustiness from the Brett. There is a fruitiness to the beer which is typical of a wild ale. This is a kick ass beer.
M: Light bodied although the tartness does give it a bit of weight.
D: All day long baby. Seriously. 616 charactersdrseamus, Nov 05, 2008
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Rich straw color with a silky off-white head. Excellent lacing. 
The nose has a bouquet of tart fruits, sweet candy malts, white wine, oak and musty barnyard funk. 
Taste is a complex yet perfectly balanced collection of sour citrus, fruity malts, manure, horseblanket, french oak barrels and chardonnay. 
Crisp, delicate body matches the style perfectly. This is some delicious stuff. I wish I had a 750.
Edit 8/09: Now that they distribute to Colorado, I do have a 750, and it's just as good as I remember. 512 charactersrye726, Oct 30, 2008

A- Corked and caged bottle. This bottle is under a lot of pressure from the carbonation, the cork nearly made a hole in the ceiling. The high carbonation also demanded a slow pour to avoid a foam over. Pours a dark golden yellow/orange color wtih a large off-white head that possesses amazing retention and lacing.
S- The aroma is a thing of beauty! The nose is dominated by a sour funkiness with some golden fruit and oak. Very complex and very "tempting". I'm looking forward to the taste. This is a great smelling beer and one I could easily sit and smell all evening.
T- The taste is extremely complex like the aroma with a good amount of sour flavors, but the sour is not completely overwhelming. The brett is really noticeable in both the aroma and taste giving it that signature earthy/funky character. I can also definitely pick up on a lot of the oak characterics from the French oak wine barrels that this beer ages in. Finally, the earthy finish is very dry.
M- The mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation
D- Temptation is another world class beer from Russian River that I wish was more readily available so more people could experience this great brewery. Highly recommended. 1,229 characterscjgator3, Oct 28, 2008

a: Cloudy blonde body with a huge fluffy white head. Superb lacing, diehard head retention.
s: Sweet, sour and full of complexity. Notes of blanc de blanc champagne, lemon and grass.
t: Light malt, mildly funky brett sourness, and the spicy yeastiness you find in a. Like the nose, the flavor is very similar ro champagne. I think the lighter malt, soft brett and barrel aging lead to this champagne flavor. In any case, I LOVE IT. Excellent and unique take on the style.
m: Prickly carbonation provides a barrier between the beers body and your tongue. Again, think champagne.
d: Loving this beer. Could be the best sour I have had, but with bottles of supplication and saison with george brett in the fridge, I had better reserve my judgment. The ideal beer for introducing non-beerdrinking wine lovers to. I think any champagne enthusiast would have to appreciate this beer. I could drink it all night long, in fact, I partially regret sharing with my wife and dear friend. Maybe I am a Jack-Ass. maybe it's just that good.

The smell is aggressive and all about the chardonnay barrel treatment; earthy, very lemony, fruity and tart...way more character than the base blonde. The mouth feel was tangy and effervescent. Full flavored, the tart lemon character and barrel treatment tastes like drinking a chardonnay out right. Too tart for me and with a bit more wine character than i could appreciate at this sitting.

4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a brilliant medium gold color with a tall, bubbly white head of foam that seems ever expanding and long-lasting. Ample carbonation is visible rising up in the glass. A sight to behold. The nose is wonderfully complex and replete with brett character - slightly acidic and quite musty with the obligatory "horsey" notes for which these wild strains are famous. Hiding behind the marvelously funky notes are wisps of oak and citrus, making this beer an incredibly intricate and challenging subject. This just from the sight and smell. The palate is not to be outdone, of course. The fine, almost effervescent carbonation delivers a startlingly dry and exceedingly tart experience in the mouth. At the same time earthy, floral and citrusy with notes of dry white wine, wood and tree fruit. Nothing short of incredible. Medium bodied with a full, voluminous mouth feel and bone dry finish. Some residual tartness with hints of oak are left on the palate, but otherwise this beer finishes completely clean - almost astringent - and as tart as they come. The oak, rather than mellowing this beer, has accentuated the subtleties and only served to make the ale more complex than it was already destined to be. In every regard an incredible beer by a master craftsman. Vinnie, you do astounding work. With a tartness that might exclude some, this beer is a wonder in the wild ale classification and a must-drink experience for the senses. One of the very best I've sampled - be it from this country or another. Outstanding. 1,521 charactersbeerphilosopher, Sep 20, 2008

my brother obtained this in a trade with brewerb
batch 003. poured into small tulips
hazy, almost cloudy. bright golden straw color with slight orange hue. lots of foamy, rocky head that doesn't fade. some spotty lacing.
smells like champagne with brett funk. hints of cider vinegar, wood and yeast. whiffs of phenols and more fruitiness (white grape). note of grass, hay and barn.
flavor has tart cider vinegar character, with more champagne notes and slight farm funkiness. sour apple fruitiness finds some toasted malt to latch onto. mild, grassy bitterness from hops and woody tannins. all of which go into a pleasantly semi-tart, semi-dry finish.
not too thin. definitely some texture from acidity (and tannin?). moderate, refreshing carbonation.
decent, although still pricey for just 375 ml. 842 characterschinabeergeek, Sep 14, 2008

S: Sweetness with funk right there behind it. I would consider this a tight nose.
T: Really nice interplay of sweet and sour. Sharp tartness up front. The blonde ale is there but hidden behind the funk and tartness. Really good but in my head I thought it would be more complex.

4.97/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden color with a huge head; the retention was very good and the beer left clumps of lace along the sides of the chalice
Smell: Except for the sour Brett tones, you would swear you were smelling an oaky chardonnay, with vanilla and white wine grapes influencing the tart green apple, apricot and sour cherry tones
Taste: Opens with a mouthful of fruit (pear and apricot) that moves in a tart, green apple direction by mid-palate; after the swallow, the tartness mellows and the more subtle fruit character (pear, melon, apricot) and oaky/vanilla elements represent themselves; unlike some of the other Wild Ales where the sour elements dominate, this one is much more subtle and complex
Mouthfeel: Light to medium body and quite creamy; medium to high carbonation
Drinkability: Another stunning achievement from Russian River; more subtle than some of the others and, in many ways, better, as a result 934 charactersbrentk56, Sep 07, 2008

12oz bottle, corked and caged, batch 3, original review on 9/4/08
Temptation pours a brilliant glowing orange color and a large, vocal, foamy white head. Thick columns of cyclone-like carbonation rise and support the bouquet from the etching in a St Feuillien snifter. The nose is straight up sour power, lots of sour funky goodness, Sweet tarts baby. While tasting, the slightly acidic sour twang that first tickled the nose upon smelling bites the tongue gently, the bright carbonation explodes the subtle flavors of mature aged wood, smoke, and a definite, quality, malt presence. Nevertheless, sour dominates, other twangy notes of lemon/lime skin and sour green grapes. The slightest hint of the 7.5 ABV shines through on the finish. The body, begins bright and alive with tiny Champagne-like carbonation bubbles but gathers itself into a nice coating mouthfeel, the only thing that comes to mind is that this beer leaves the same feeling that lemon heads do to the tongue and cheeks, amazing! Incredible, i cant stop drinking this beer. The flavor really leaves you craving another sip, i think endorphins may just be at work with this one. Incredible, send some to Jersey! 1,227 charactersATPete, Sep 05, 2008
4.87/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from Batch 3...
Pours a beautiful cloudy golden color with a hugh fluffy white head, it looks like a cloud.
The aroma coming from the beer is amazing - sour apples, lemons, wild cherries, horse blanket brett, oak and small hits of chardonnay...wow this is great.
The flavor is equally amazing...sour apple, lemon sourness, wet oak, chardonnay flavors...its sour but not too sour at all a nice crisp dry finish.
The mouthfeel is wonderful...nice carbonation, nice sour profile.
I could drink this beer all night...my only concern would be some acid reflux from this, but thats a small price to pay to drink such a great beer. 636 charactersgregc, Sep 04, 2008
3.86/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Batch #003. Pours a finger of pure white head of fine bubbles that clings. Liquid is dark golden with brownish tinge. Smells dark sour. Very horseblanket, cherry pits, dusty.
Tastes dry. Cherry wood, phenolic, smoke, lemons, and peaches. Puckering dry quenching with an acid bite (not quite acetic). Light to md-light body and decent carbonation. Decent drinkability. 368 charactersmentor, Sep 03, 2008
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bought this 375ml bottle at Lone Hill Liquors. Poured into tulip glass that revealed a golden pale color with 1" head, great lacing on all sides of the glass. The smell is very different, consisting of sour cherries, apples and a hint of lemon. Taste is equivalent to the smell, instantly hitting your palate with sour fruit and yeasty bread. Not a beer I am used to but definitely grows on you after several sips. Mouthfeel is dry with an almost champagne like carbonation and slight alcohol on the finish. Drinkability is good as your palate adjusts to the unique sourness of this creative ale. Can't wait to try more in the Russian River lineup of incredible beers. They do not disappoint! 692 charactersfahne23, Sep 01, 2008
4.1/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Small corked bottle, batch 001. Thanks jhenry04 for this one, I think (my logbook was lost; please correct me if I am wrong).
Poured into a tulip, after aging and really cold as suggested by thier website. My first impression is that time mellowed the brett characteristics somehow, not the Chardonnay notes. 
Anyway, let's get to it: Bright golden, with a thin white head probably because it is too cold. Nice lacing, though. 
Aroma is where most Brett will be found; there is some funk and leather, if not a lot; acidic and mineral notes, but a lot of oak and Chardonnay-like notes dominate the aroma, along with a fruitiness made mostly of oranges. 
Lively and refreshing, as mentioned, it shows a lot of oak and chardonnay like characteristics on the palate, and although it has a certain sourness, it is not prominent. The acidity sort of salvages the package. 
Do not take this review the wrong way, it is a very good beer, just not the "powerhouse of funk" I expected; it is still highly drinkable, but unfortunately aging just accentuated the wine characteristics. I would drink any batch 1 remaining. 1,110 charactersbrdc, Aug 28, 2008

375mL corked and caged bottle poured into a tulip glass. Batch 003
A: First thing of note is the healthy pop as the cork is twisted out of the bottle with a whispy white smoke of carbonation sneaking out of the neck. A very slow pour yeilds a peach skin orange and amber and slightly hazy color. The carbonation coming from the bottom of this beer is off the charts, it looks almost like champagne is in the glass, and it holds up a modest but dignified tightly packed white head that sticks around for the duration.
S: Lemon grass, white pepper, sour cherry, apple, peach and pear coupled with a detectable amount of that oaky wine character mentioned on the label of the bottle. My mouth is watering...
T/MF: Mild barnyard haylike funk but also incredibly fruity, pear, apricote and white peach mixed with a slight white grapeiness closes with a lemon and oaky peppery herbal zest. First few sips are incredibly bubbly and fill the mouth almost entirely with foam, after a bit this settles down into a more manageable bubbliness and given even more time, a slight creaminess.
D: Pretty damn good I'd say, much better than the sour as hell Beatification, this was sour and balanced, it didn't cover up anything and let the complexities of the beer dance across the palate. An excellent sipper. 1,433 charactersbluemoonswoon, Aug 28, 2008
4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to murchmac/mikesgroove for this one.
Pours a nice slightly cloudy yellow/light orange with a very nice fizzy white head. Nose is tart funk, oak, and pepper. Taste follows with good oak and wine flavors hidden amongst the tart wild flavor. Some ripe granny smith. Crisp. Mouthfeel is a little more carbonated than usual, which I like. Drinkability is certainly one of the finest of the style I have yet enjoyed. A very good wild from RR, as usual. highly recommended. 475 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Aug 26, 2008

My share poured into a Chimay goblet... I believe this was Batch 3... Sam decided to throw this down after we had cracked all the planned brews.... BadAss!
Hazy straw with a good head and a little bit of retention.. sorta looks like a slightly cloudy sparkling wine.
Aroma is like a dry white wine.. citrus zest.. underripe peaches and grapes.. 
Flavor mirrors the aroma.. sour and fruity and a little oakey.. never reaching acedic territory.. wonderful and very complex... has a puckering quality like when sucking on grape skins and seeds. Body is champagne like with prickly carbonation... and the drinkablity is fantastic... I would pick this over any sparking wine any day, any where, and any circumstance.. awesome.
Thanks again, Sam!

A: Pours a nice light yellow hue with an average head with good retention. Nice bubbles rising to the top. A touch of lace.
S: Nice light aromas vinous grape aromas with hints of oak and brett. Somewhat toasty with waves of sour that tickle the nose.
T: The taste is very vinous in the start. It yields to citrus, funk, oak, and vanilla. A bit acidic in the finish with brett, and mild sugar coming out.
M: Very spritzy, champagne like with a dry finish.
D: Yes, a fine American Beligan Style. I don't think anyone in the US does it better than Russian River. 584 characterstpd975, Aug 09, 2008

Oak, lemon, acid, green apple skin, almond, and fresh cut herbs in the nose. Very pleasant. 
Big time sourness. Lemon, some pineapple, slight apple, aspirin, and some floral flavors. A touch of sweetness in the middle. Lots of vanilla and oak on the back of the tongue. Finish is crisp and lemony. Simply amazing flavors here. Beautiful.
Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Very refreshing. I love this beer, I remember tasting Batch 001 on my first visit to Russian River Brewing Co. and waiting with baited breath for the release of the next batch ever since. Simply a lovely beer. Highly recommended. 719 charactersbosco7, Aug 07, 2008

3.3/5  rDev -25.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Paid $12.99 for a 12.7 oz bottle from Monument Liquor in Concord, CA. Poured into a wine glass with a few pours. This is Batch 003 according to the bottle.
A very fizzy huge head from a soft pour but not sure of the carbonation levels at first glance. Nearly opaque from the cloudiness. This is a golden orange color reminiscent of a wheat/APA cross. The head retains at about a quarter inch and the lacing is thick, fizzy and slowly receding.
Smells very strong and yeasty. Carbonation detected in the nose. Hints of alcohol. Slightly spicy with earthy undertones. Hops somewhat evident, mainly of a perfumy/herbal variety. A warming sensation envelopes my head when getting a good whiff of this one - quite odd. I haven't figured if the aroma is pleasant to me, but I give it an A+ for originality - I've never smelled anything quite like it before.
Taste is so much different than the smell, it is incredible. First sip tells me - no this is terrible. It slowly gets better, but I'm still not sold on it I think. Again, like the smell, A+ for originality, but this one just doesn't trigger the pleasure part of my brain. Very funky yeast taste with some spiciness that was detected in the nose. 
Highly carbonated and fizzy in the mouth. Light to medium bodied.
If you are looking for something that is drinkable and VERY different, this is your ticket. An experimental brew that is certainly worth trying and I commend the folks at Russian River for taking their precious time and energy to brew this one. I keep sipping it and am not sure if I like it - this one is confusing to me on all fronts - its misteriousness is intruguing. 1,641 charactersibbjamin, Jul 24, 2008

Decanted from the bottle into an oversized wine glass. Pours a golden color with a big, thick head. Looks great. Aroma of funk, sourness, lemon and apple. Smells very wine like and completely delicious. Taste is just good. Initially hits you with some sourness, then, lemon, apple, and back to sour. Mouthfeel is well carbonated but creamy. Drinkability is off the scales. This beer is more or less perfect and one of my favorites. 511 charactersthrowitallaway, Jul 20, 2008

Big thanks to SpaceCoyote for this 1.
A- Bright hazy yellow with a big frothy head. Thick lacing down the glass.
S- Sour mix, funky wet barnyard hay, and sweet citrus.
T- Big sour grapefruit, lemon, grape, and granny smith apple. Tart cherries and grapes through the body with a sweet funky hay/ straw flavor in the end.
M- Very sour and tart with a big sweet citrus feel. Dry funky sour finish leaves a touch of alcohol in the throat.
Overall- Another funky sour/ tart beer from RR, and another tasty, unique sipper. I enjoyed. 569 charactersNJpadreFan, Jul 13, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle poured into a snifter.
A: Pours a bright hazy orangish yellow with a big puffy white head that lingers for ages leaving massive clumps of lacing. This is a gorgeous looking beer.
S: Smell is a good dose of sweet, sour and tart. There is the sweet citrus of lemon rinds and oranges along with some tart cherry and a bit of oak as well. This is all on top of the bready yeast smell in the background and some wine coming through in the nose as well.
T: The taste is a slightly more tart version of the smell with big tart cherries and lemon rind up front with a trace of barnyard funk as well. There's a little sweetness in there as well with a bready malt backbone but an oaky presence that lingers in the finish.
M: Mouthfeel is creamy but also dry like wine in the finish.
D: This is definitely a good starter wild ale for those of us still developing the palate for sours. I really enjoyed this and it's quite a refreshing brew on a hot day. 955 charactersgford217, Jul 12, 2008
4.87/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 003. Poured into a wine glass. 
Pours a beautiful hazy gold with champagne-like carbonation fizzing along the walls and a persistent one finger white head. Wisps and globs of lacing line the glass. 
Nose is tart and cider-like with a whiff of white wine, cherries, and flowers.
Tart, crab apple sourness up front with sparkling, fluffy carbonation. A sublime aftertaste that is almost too good to describe: butterscotch, white grapes, warming alcohol, dry mead.
Creamy and very carbonated in the mouth; the bottle conditioning is perfect. 
This is an unbelievably delicious beer. Pushes boundaries in multiple directions. The quality is impeccable. The care with which it is made is evident. The only thing hampering drinkability is price and availability. 767 charactersFreightTrain, Jul 12, 2008

A: The beer is a light gold color, with a large white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is full of yeast along with light malts, tart fruit and some hops, plus the typical scent of oak barrel-aging.
T: The taste is very tart and sour up front and on top of that escalates into a sharp bite, with flavors of yeast, lemon, green apples and some spice that lingers in the finish. There's a decent hops presence that brings some balance. The malt character is pretty thin. The after-taste is sour and slightly bitter.
M: Smooth and very crisp, light body, medium-to-high carbonation, clean and very dry finish.
D: Flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, I can certainly appreciate the craftsmanship and work that went into this beer and it's a good one to pick if you like the intense sourness, but it's not really my kind of beer. 1,066 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jul 10, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Batch 003
 This is a light, hazy blonde color with a massive, bubbly, beastie head with air-filled bubbles, crown at least 3" high, very sticky with amazing retention. looks light and fluffy.
 The scent upfront is tart, sour berries, musty, citric yeast, wet wheat and grass, sweet tarts, green apples, green veggies. Very natural and earthy smelling overall.
 The taste is also tart and sour upfront with a huge earthy yeastie flavor. There's citric fruits like lemmons along with crab apples, and other "wild" fruits like tiny, wild strawberries and raspberries. There's an earthy bitterness for balance...the wheat and dried hay-like flavor pops out at the end too. 
 The feel is a light, refreshing and slightly dry kick but the sticky foam gives it a soft feel on the way down. Very smooth actually.
 I really love these unique and experimental brews, pushing the boundries is what it's all about, especially when it works! 933 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Jul 09, 2008
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From a .375 bottle.
The beer pours an impressive, hazy gold color with impressive head retention and very good lacing. The nose on this beer is the best thing about it in my opinion, consisting of honey, citrus, white pepper, vanilla and some light sour funk. This beer smells very complex. However, considering the way this beer smells, I'm a bit surprised by the level of sour in this beer. There is a hint of honey and vanilla, but it's just about overwhelmed by the sour funk. As the beer sits in the glass the sour dies down a bit and blends in more with the other flavors. I get some more vanilla and even cherry now, which is interwoven with the sour funk. The beer is medium bodied, but there's a crispness in the finish that I really like, that helps to make this beer very refreshing and drinkable. 
Very interesting beer. Not entirely my cup of tea, but it was fun to try nonetheless. 897 charactersJohn_M, Jul 07, 2008
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks goes out to prototypic for this gem.
A - Color is on the light side of gold. A small amount of cloudiness make it into the bottle but the color still remians bright. Head looked good topping out at just over an inch with a careful pour. A constant supply of rising carbonation sent the retention through the roof. The resulting lace left behind looks good as well.
S - Some funkiness shows up in the aroma and is not too strong. The wood is a nice compliment to the initial funk. Some fruit notes come in about midway - apple and grape. Notes of cinnamon and alcohol finish things up. The aroma was not as strong as expected but still very pleasing.
T - A sour and funky flavor from the Brett dominates. The funk fades quick to allow some fruitiness to play off the sour flavor. Starts to resemble young green apples. The oak adds a layer of flavor that is a great under pinning for the sour / bitter fruit. Alcohol is present throughout the flavor but is kept in check by the other robust flavors and complexity of the brew. Very nice.
M - Medium bodied with a high level of carbonation that works well for this brew. The oak feels like it adds to the body which is nice. Finish is sour and fruity and does not stop.
D - Drinkability is very good. The Brett is strong but does not overtake everything this beer is trying to showcase. The oak presence works wonders in this particular beer - adding flavor and body. The higher alcohol does place some limits on the amount that should be consumed in a session. Still, very good and glad I got the chance to try it. 1,575 characterscsmiley, Jul 05, 2008

I put it in the fridege early this a.m. to have some time soon. I opened the fridge early this evening to discover that my fridge liht bulb was out, and the cage and cork on the bottom of my fridge. I guess the thing popped and took out my light bulb....crazy.
A- This pours a bright, yet hazy yellow. A straw colored yellow with plenty of acrive streamers clinging to the sides. A perfectly white tiny bubbled foam cap that hangs out for the duration.
S- Definetly sour sour and sour with brett. A slight phenolic sourness to it, but more noticable to me is sour stone fruits. Great for a hot summer day.
T- Smooth yet definetly sour as noted in the smell with the sour stone fruits. Especially sour cherry with apricot. 
M- This sour is almost creamy to me, maybe its the tiny nitro like bubbles, or the aging. The carbonation is perfect. Noticeable, you appreciate them, but it does not overwhelm this beer.

Anyhoo- to the beer- Batch 3 - Poured inot a tulip glass after a huge pop and a lot of champagne-like head busting out of the bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with large white bubbly head. The head fades pretty quickly. Aromas are plentiful at the start- sour apples, wine, and some citrus- lemon peels. The smells fade as it warms. Taste is delightful. Strong flavors of sour fruits, but also alcohol, the chardonnay kicks in, then you get a bit of woodsy smoke at the end. Crisp, dry finish. Lingering champagne aftertaste and burn. Warms me as I drink. Hell, I am sweating. This is my fave RR so far!!! 794 charactersDrDogbeer, Jun 22, 2008

The smell is excellent and suggests sour and wine. The taste is pretty darn good and less sour than expected but still a pucker. This seems a little more subtle and complex compared to Supplication and Beatification but then maybe they aren't meant to be compared? There is not much funk to be found but all in all this is excellent. I've been skeptical about paying high prices for beer but these barrel-aged RR beers are worth it in my mind.

This could take your eye out if you don't chill it first but it is delicious after a year in the bottle. It gushed at first but it smells awesome. Peach and citrus and a very subtle sourness, wow. I think this has actually improved since it was released because it tastes fantastic.

This beer was served in a wide mouthed wine goblet. The beers scores are from initial impressions. I may have been a bit tight. This is an exceptional beer treat.
Appearance: The beer poured a very clear orange/ peach coloration. The head was about one finger high delicate biege foamyness. The lacing left behind on the glass was light but lovely. 
Smell: The beer hits my nose with a melange of lemon, very funky fruityness, peppery coriander, no aspect of this beer is excessively dominate.
Taste: This beer is very fruity under ripe apple and pears. The chardonay wine barrels have worked there magic and flavors on the beer. Pleasant oakey flavors peak around. Corriander pepperyness mingles with tart Brett funkyness and a bit of grassyness. 
Mouthfeel: This beer is smooth and well carbonated. The beer seems to have a light body but still commands the attention of my palate. 
Drinkability: The beer departed my glass at an alarming pace. This truly is a master work. 1,084 charactersnlmartin, Jun 19, 2008

Pours a foggy gold with a thin white head that falls. Nose is funky. Very much reminds me of a lambic style nose. Flavor has a definite oak qualities as well as some distinct vanilla tones. Some citrus is there as well. Really nice wood stuff going on here. Nicely done. Feel has a crisp carbonation to it and the liquid is typical. This is nice. There's a bit of a bite to it, which would be a detractor for some. But this is a well made wild ale. Nice levels of complexity. I'd say this is good with fish, chicken, or a pork chop with a mild sauce to it. 567 charactersRblWthACoz, Jun 17, 2008

A: The ale is hazy, a mixture of orange juice and tang with some shots of cola throughout to darken it a bit. A decent head, amply carbonated, welled up on pour but did not lace.
S: The aroma is bitterly tart, sour with an abundance of green apple, pepper and lots of funk. The dry bite of the chardonnay is present as well.
T: The tartness is layered, exposing multiple elements with each sip. Fruit up front in the form of green apple, apricot and lemon. Later sips reveal more tartness, woody with a dry chardonnay finish. Ample carbonation clears the palate with most every sip, allowing new flavors to emerge each time. A sweet white grape finish reinforces the chardonnay. A deliciously complex ale.
M: Lots of fruit, funk and wood throughout. If you don't like sours, this one may be too much of a bite.
D: The woody, vinous finish keeps me coming back for more each time. A wonderous and wonderful brew.

The aroma is sour and strong. Floral/Fruit aroma but serous funky! Pretty hard core. 
Just so you know I hate chardonnay, but this one had an amazing balance of the chardonnay characters, fruit and fine woody taste; and Brett-yeast sourness. Amazing how this one won me over.
Vinegary flavor with a touch of sweetness that will keep one puckering!

Aroma was sour and funky with hay, grass, yeast and light fruits. Fantastic aroma. I could smell this one all day. 
Taste was very tart. Notes of apple, peach, citrus and brett. 
Full bodied and sweet. Lots going on in this one and an absolutely amazing beer. 458 charactersdrumrboy22, Jun 14, 2008

I love the sourness of the beer, a bit of a vinegary flavor with some lemon and oak. Just a great beer and highly drinkable. I could enjoy this almost every day. 272 charactersdill, Jun 14, 2008
4.15/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A caged/corked bottle, received in a great trade from vwcraig.
A loud pop began some slow bubbling overflow from the bottle. Pours a hazy yellow straw color with slight grey-brown depth. Climbing mounds of nearly white uniformly bubbled foam leave sticky frothy lace all over.
Nice sour funk on the nose, with a thin light grain scent. Sourness is almost spicy. Vinous, with nice rich oak and tart fruit aromas.
Flavor is crisp, fresh, and tart with plenty of sourness. Mildly tannic with a good oaky back. Citrus and herb pop with a funky sour finish. Grains sneak out from under the yeast flavor at the very end, fading but hanging on mixed with a light sweetness. Bready aftertaste indicates fuller flavor than is present during the sip, heavier than initial tastes suggest. Yeast flavors really overpower the character of the beer hiding behind all the sour and tart.
Feel is a lighter medium body, really lifted by the carbonation. An interesting balance of effervescence and mouth coating slick feel.
Nicely sippable and very intriguing. Great flavor, though not my favorite. 1,086 characterslightindarkness, Jun 09, 2008
4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5I would consider this beer a much more drinkable Beatification. While the aforementioned beer is one of the most compelling beers I've ever tasted, this one is a far less extreme version.
It looks excellent and the sediment is your call based on the pour. The color is a nice, crisp gold.
The smell is fantastic with the 'barnyard' becoming more apparent as it warms. There are elements of citrus and even a little sweeter white wines.
Taste rewards the smell. Big on the tastebuds, but not overpowering on the mouthfeel. While very tart, there is a soft grapefruit (doesn't seem possible). As with many of these American Wild Ales, you can't stop wanting to try more!
As for drinkability, this style of beer has grown on me. However, the best way to enjoy a bottle of this is to share with others unfamiliar with the style. It's a great "I told you, beer is the new wine!' experience. 889 charactersBenway, Jun 08, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch #3. Hazy peach coloured, with 2 fingers of foamy, off-white head. Good head retention, still there when I finish the glass.
The smell is sweet and tart all at once. Fruit (mostly citrus) and oak dominate. Lemon juice and orange rind.
The taste is again full of citrus. Grapefruit, lemon and orange rind. It is strongly sour, slightly puckering in the finish. Lingering oak is noted even hours later.
Light bodied but a bit sticky. Medium carbonation. A touch acidic. Altogether pretty good.
I enjoyed this one. I don't think I could drink it all night, but I'd be willing to give it a shot. 600 characterselricorico, Jun 04, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5pours a clear straw yellow into a snifter. Fluffy two finger head leaves sticky lacing all over. Citrus & earth on the nose, with the vanilla oakiness pushing through. Super complex on the tongue. The sourness is more on the lemony side, with green grape & melon. The oakiness comes as it warms, with a greater vanilla & earthy presence. The Chardonnay barrels are duly noted, adding a tannic pucker along with the lemon sour. Dry & crisp, a great summer sipper. There's a very good reason these Russian River sours are so sought after! They're delicious! 555 characters0110x011, Jun 04, 2008
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I picked up this offering while in California. I poured this into a wine glass, the body is strawberry blonde leacing a pale white lace that disappates leaving a slightly foggy carbonated beauty in its wake.
The aroma is tart, lemon, viscous, very wine like with a distinctive brett character. The taste is nicely tart, sweet underlying honey plays off the very tart, and funky, acidic, feel on the palate. This is a very nice beer solid one bottle is enough for now but this tastes great in this summer heat. 510 charactersFranchise, Jun 03, 2008
4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 003
It pours a nice clear golden blonde with a huge amount of creamy white head and lots of continuous carbonation. The head leaves a thick lacing as it slowly recedes. The aroma is really wonderful. It is just full of ripe fruits; cherries, some melon, and even some lemon, which is all backed by some really solid belgian yeasty goodness, subtle oak and some hints of a dry white wine. There is also the underlying sour undertone you expect.
This is truly an extremely complex beer. Upon first taste it is very very tart. Sour cherry takes a leading role, while melon and grapes are both present and come through stronger as it warms up. The oak flavors are subtle but present, and there are some light phenols there. It comes off as being very wine-like with it's dry finish, but with a more refreshing mouthfeel. Sipping on a bottle of this is a wonderful experience and I'm thankful stores near me still have more in stock for me to horde. 952 charactersASymon13, May 31, 2008
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Mini-vertical sampling of batch 2 vs. 3.
Both batches open up with a loud pop, and straw in color. Batch 2 gushed up within seconds, allowing some hazy yeast to make it into the glass. Batch 3 was clear. Lacing and retention is superior in batch 2, but in either case, not exceptional.
Batch 2:
Plenty of dry, bretty character, with wine-like mustyness, and a smidge of oak in the nose. Earthy, hay-like, and lightly tropical with pineapple. A hint of quanine and minerally bite.
Thin to medium mouthfeel. A decent amount of effervesence and slightly creamy with an edge.
Tart and vineous on the pallet. Grassy, hay-like, and slightly peppery. Plenty of lemony pizzaz and acid. Loads of finesse, barn-like earthiness, and white grape must.
Finishes with lingering lemon pith, white pepper, and warming acidity.
Batch 3:
A trace of sweet malt leads off in tandem with tart wheat. The Brett is restrained, but present, which allows traces of orange citrus fruits, vanilla, smoldered styrofoam, and ground bark to step forward. Quite earthy and unique. 
Crisp and creamy mouthfeel. Tart and quenching.
Tart lemon pulp leads off the pallet, with sour grapes, grapefruit pith, and pineapple skin. A trace of pepper with plenty of clove.
Finishes exceedingly vineous with tart lemons, wet hay, and pepper-studded grapefruit.
The low-down:
Batch 2 certainly has developed more brett, pepper, pineapple, and funk in general. Dryer and more complex than 3, which is really saying something. 2 is also more vineous, tart and acidic than 3. A couple of things I enjoyed in the 3 over the 2 was the vanilla in the nose, and the slight tropical orange note. The 2 is definately headed in a more Gueze-like direction, but certainly nowhere near the acid level of a good Gueze.
While I prefer the 2 over the 3, it is by a marginal amount and is just a testament to how well Vinnie's barrel aged beers cellar. 1,905 charactersbrewandbbq, May 26, 2008

Batch 003
First things first, Smell that Brett!
Pale gold yellow cloud with a 2" head. Leaves a nice coat on the sides but that fades too. 
This beer reeks of Brett and Oak! The sirens are going off for the sour smell. 
This beer is sour as a MF'er! Tart, smooth and sour like a good belgian! Seriously this beer can hang with all the #1s out there! Little fruit, saison like spice but always sour and tart from start to finish. So Smooth! The tartness sticks around a while and refuses to leave the back of your throat. Mmmmm thank you! So Tart and so so yummy!
It's smooth with a bubbly complexity. The carbonation is very light. Tangy and zesty with a nice strong zap of oak near the end of each mouthful.
This beer is so so drinkable. Did a belgian brewery brew this? This can't be from America. O wait it is. Finally a brewery worth the same praise as say, De Dolle...Yummm
Ok I no longer want to review this beer...I need to focus on drinking and enjoying it! Wow this is a delicious brew! 1,055 charactersRixBeer, May 25, 2008
4.83/5  rDev +9.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bought these on-line from Russian River and was generously sent to me by 0110x011. I love Russian River and I especially love these sour wild ales. Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale tulip. Batch 003.
Appearance- Pours a lowly hazy light yellowish orange with a HUGE two finger fluffy white head that evenly turns into a HUGE three finger bright white head. I didn't touch the beer either... It has a mind of its own. Maintains a one finger cap and collar for the entire duration of this treat.
Smell- Mildly funky but not to the extent of some other Russian River varieties. Light Hef like banana is present without the spice which I think would be there for it not for the barrel aging. The lightly woody vanilla is way more evident once it warms and at this point the beer really shines. Tart and sharp on the nose (tarter and sharper when cold) it's just a good all around smell.
Taste- Lightly tart and sharp this brew graciously takes on the characteristics of chardonnay without giving up its true identity of a delicious beer. The wood is way more present in this beer than in the other RR barrel aged I've tried. Light vanilla and oak are probably more predominant that the Brett; which instead of dominating the beer, turns out to play a gorgeous second fiddle. A tiny bit of green apple puckering shows toward the end with its peach/banana counterparts. The finish is über smooth and full of woody goodness. Amazing...
Mouthfeel- Really smooth and light with a soft creamy body and light crisp carbonation that looks like it should be more aggressive than it is.
Drinkability- This is one ridiculously good brew. I honestly didn't think I could like a Brett filled brew more than I liked Supplication. Wrong! Although probably not as complex and confounding, it's the very definition of simpler is better (in relative terms of 17 months barrel aging, adding of Brett, maintaining perfection, etc...). This is a ridiculously good beer that thank the lord, I have one more of coming. Thanks Matt! 2,007 charactersyounger35, May 17, 2008
4.82/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One of two bottles bought online from RR. This is batch 003. The other sent off in a trade so I am savoring this one. 
It pours a peachy amber color with a fluffy, white head and it leaves amazing lacing on the glass as I drink it. This smells absolutely incredible. It has a very nice subtle sourness and an extremely inviting sweetness behind it. I could smell this all day long. The taste is predominantly of sour fruits but it is not so overpowering as to cover up the nice oakiness and light malt sweetness. This is best described as subtle but amazing. At first I had the taste as a 4.5 but it just got even better as it warmed and had to change it to a 5. The mouthfeel is great for a sour,very dry and wine like. It is extremely drinkable and the alcohol is just non existent in the taste. I wish I had bought many more of these babies. Highly recommended. 865 charactersthickerfreakness, May 16, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 003 from my trip to CA [should have bought 2 :-( ]
Poured into one of my random tulips. The head on this was amazing to begin with, white thick and creamy and it had staying power for a good few minutes. The color of this tasty libation was definitely blonde, a hazy but bright yellow blonde.
The aroma of sour fruits is undeniable, I found sour apple and lemon to be the most abundant. At the same time I almost felt I was sniffing a champagne or chardonnay (go figure), which became more intense with the first sip. 
The taste is very sour fruity and a lovely hint of wine, definitely some funk. Also there is this very pleasing tingle of the tongue from the carbonation, awesome!
I could have easily drank this all myself, but I was nice and shared. Next time though, all me. 788 charactersnaproxen, May 15, 2008

Pours a hazy bright golden yellow/light amber color with big white head made up of tiny bubbles, long lasting creamy retention and beautiful lacing. Smells of earthy Brett, sour fruits like lemon, apples, pear, peach, and apricot, Chardonnay, yeast, and spices. Great tart taste of lemons, peaches, white grapes, and apricot mix with apple cider vinegar and Chardonnay with a gentle yeasty bread and spiciness mixed in. Light in body but with a nice dry finish leaving you wanting more. Smooth and effervescent with no sign of alcohol, more tart than sour. A really easy to drink wild ale with lots of tartness, great appearance, and great flavors with more complexity coming out in every sip. Lower in alcohol than some others, and hides the alcohol wonderfully. 869 charactersHopDerek, May 14, 2008

I can't get enough of this beer. This is by far the best beer I've had yet this year. There's some yeast in the bottle, so pour gently. A good pour leaves a brilliant crystal clear straw yellow beer with lively bubbles that lift to the top of the glass creating a rocky white foamy head. The acidity is not overpowering and it plays nicely with the high carbonation and apple, citrus and wine aromas and flavors. To me, this beer defines craft brewing. 462 charactersTheEremite, May 13, 2008

Very inviting aromas of sour apple, funk, and perfume.
Sour green apple on the front...grassy. Reminds me of a sour Sauvignon Blanc crosses with sparkling wine. Juicy, dry finish with the oak very noticeable. Oak leaves a woody, almost tangy resin in my mouth. Very hard to detect at first, but more apparent towards the last few sips. Maybe age will smooth that out?
In any event, glorious glass of beer. 615 charactersRustyDiamond, May 12, 2008

A: I popped the cork on this one and was immediately rewarded with the head pouring out all over the place. Once it settled down, I was able to fill up my glass...a hazy mustard-yellow beer was revealed. Almost looks like a hefe. The head was enormous, like 3 fingers, with great retention. 
S: Mild sour/lemony smell hit first, along with lots of funk and woodseyness. Less sour and more funk in this beer.
T: Really nice complex flavor. Sourness is pretty subdued but definitely a major element. I also got some funk, oak, dark red wine, and a surprisingly honey sweet finish. The red wine flavor is probably most prominent once you notice it, but the mix of flavors is pretty well balanced.
MF: Smooth feel with just a bit of carbonation bite, which was surprising considering how huge the head was. Syrupy sweet and filling in the mouth, and an ultra-dry finish as well. Alcohol doesn't really hit that hard for 7%. 
D: This is an excellent beer, and I lament the fact that I only bought one. I had the Supplication a few weeks ago as well, and this totally blows it away. The balance of the flavor is great. The sourness becomes a nice accent instead of being in-your-face as it sometimes get. It goes down so smooth that it would be easy to rush through it, but the flavor makes you want to savor it. Awesome work by Vinnie and crew...I understand now why this is so popular. 1,432 charactersrxdrewthejew, May 07, 2008
4.79/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received from my boy AndySR in trade. Thank you! 
Temptation pours a hazy yellow with two fingers of head in my tulip glass, and it left patchy lacing on the glass. The earthiness of the Brett comes out full force with a funky sourness with hints of lemons, apples, oranges, chardonnay. The flavor profile starts out slightly sour with flavors that remind me of granny smith apples, lemons, and unripe cherries. I also get a good dose of chardonnay flavor from the barrel aging. This is so pleasant and the flavors meld very well in the profile. I was still finding new things as I drank the last drop of this beer. The ever changing fruitiness on this beer is my favorite aspect of this beer. There is a great deal of expected carbonation in this beer that leaves a dry sensation on the mouth that is actually quite smooth. The drinkablity for this beer is amazing and I hope I can get some more of this beer.
Overall this was an incredible drinking experience. I know it is beer, but right now is has a great deal of wine characteristics to it. I would really like to get my hands on more and age it for a year or two because I think this beer would only get better. I honestly hope though that it doesn't get any better because I would do dirty and despicable things to get more of this beer.
Thank you Andy! 1,314 charactersTheodorHerzl, May 07, 2008
4.61/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5For review #200 and my 26th birthday, I've decided to pull out something I couldn't imagine letting go. Here's to celebrating with something good.
Batch 002
APPEARANCE: Pours into my Hennepin chalice a clear, golden yellow. The 2-finger, tightly bubbled, white head on tap is rock solid and is constantly being replenished. It holds firm as a thick, solid cap and leaves sheets of lace behind.
SMELL: The unmistakable aroma of Brettanomyces fills my nose. It accompanies a light, dry golden Belgian ale ripe with the smells of light citrus and a bit of apricot and peach.
TASTE: The first sip is initially quite tart, but not so much to make your mouth pucker. It soon gives way to the most luxurious sweetness containing the fruity flavors found in the nose. The bottom drops out of it on the finish, leaving a fleeting reminder of the beer you just tasted with a subtle tartness, and begs you to take another sip.
MOUTHFEEL: Quite dry with a piquant, effervescent carbonation. Very nice.
DRINKABILITY: Well, the only reason this would take a long time to drink is because I hate to see it go. I think it goes without saying that I wish I had another one of these.
Just wow. Vinny is a wizard of brewing magic. Now I just need to find more of this somehow. 1,264 charactersjmalex, May 06, 2008

Batch 003
Poured a 375ml bottle into a snifter.
Appearance - It pours a hazy yellow peach color. It produces a solid one finger head that slowly dissipated, but never fully goes away - it lasted throughout the entire drinking experience. The head's texture is very fine, billowy. It leaves behind amazing lacing the further along I drink. Carbonation streams rise from hundreds of points along the perimeter of the glass. This is a perfect looking beer.
Smell - I love the way sour beers smell. This one screams tart. The Brett makes its presence known straight off the bat. It has a slightly sweet component, which when tied to the tartness reminds me of SweeTarts. I get notes of lemon, green apple, a hint of orange, Chardonnay, and a woody note from the oak. I wish that the scent was as powerful as the flavor.
Taste - Wow. I love the punch a good sour has. I immediately detect the wild yeast, as well as citrus. I taste tart lemon, white grape juice, woody oak, nectarine or tangerine and Chardonnay. It becomes more dry and sour towards the finish. It very complex, and has huge depth of flavor. This is just what I want from a sour brew.
Mouthfeel - The carbonation level is perfect for a beer this style. It has a high level of carbonation, but cuts through the tartness without detracting from the drinking experience. It is slightly astringent, but that should be expected from a beer of this style. Overall it has a creamy texture, and it is incredibly smooth going down.
Drinkability - Amazing. What a well crafted beer - a feat of brewing prowess. This is amazing drinkable, I find myself drinking it way too fast. None of the flavors are in competition with each other. I enjoyed this one better than I enjoyed Batch 002. I could drink this all day. 1,833 charactersMiguelMandingo, Apr 27, 2008

Wow, this one was a gusher. I opened it, and all seemed well, and then it was like a volcano erupting on my desk. I did my best to contain it as well as possible, but there was some loss sadly. This pours a hazy light orange color with a finger of sticky foam on top. 
Aroma is sour and tart, with hints of cherry, oak, vinegar, and a bit of wine. Flavor is rich and fantastic. I don't even know that I can describe it. It's sweet, tart, nicely sour, and delicious. Hints of oak and wine abound, with some nice cherry and fruit flavors as well. Alcohol is completely hidden. Amazingly well brewed. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a crisp dry finish that has some staying power.
This is an outstanding brew from Russian River. This beer deserves the hype it gets as it is utterly outstanding. 848 charactersYonderWanderer, Apr 26, 2008

Pours a hazy honey yellow with a nice foamy white head that remained for a long time and laced nicely. This is one outstanding looking beer. 
I smell sour oak barrels up front with a slight citrus background. 
Taste was tart upfront with almost a unripe fruit (cherries or granny smith apple) flavor. mid palate the oak flavor came into play pretty strongly. At about that same time there was a white grapeskin flavor, perhaps the some of the residual charodonney from the oak barrels presenting itself. The finish is almost a sour candy flavor in that it is sweetish but at the same time quite tart. 
This one is not sour as much as tart, so it is very drinkable right now. Not sure how much more tartness will develop with the brett over the coming months, but i have a couple more hanging out in the DBF and intend to find out. 
It was well carbonated and very light feeling in the mouth. It finished quite dry on the palate making me want to keep going back for more. 
I had no problems finishing the entire 375 ml bottle by myself. I did not even realize this beer was 7.25% until i was done and started to feel it a little. It was a very tasty sour beer, one i cant wait to enjoy again soon! 1,291 characterstayner, Apr 25, 2008

375ml bottle, states "Batch 003" but no other dating. 
Appearance: pours a hazy bright golden orange. Light white head, moderately dense, dissipates rapidly, leaves lots of small lacing dots. 
Aroma: sour and tangy, hints of citrus fruits, mostly lemon and maybe tart oranges. 
Taste: sour sour sour! Lemon, very light hints of tangerine maybe. But the sourness is definitely the player here. The Brett comes through, though if I get another bottle at at some point, I'd like to see what it would be like in a year or two. 
Mouth: Light and tingly, the Brett and sourness makes it slightly sharp. Limited to no alcohol warmth evident. Dry. 
Overall: Very tasty, very drinkable beer, especially for the style, though I have to agree with others that it's a little one-dimensional. I'd buy it, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $13 it commands. 892 characterswarmstorage, Apr 24, 2008

A: Pours a golden yellow, with a voluminous white head, with thick, sticky laicng and good retention.
S: Earthy brett jumps out at first, then lemongrass, honeysuckle flowers, and light sugar.
T: Big flavours of sour lemon juice hit first, white grape juice in there as well, but it is much more secondary. The dry brett comes in in the aftertaste giving a raw funk, but it has a certain lightness about it. The acidity is there all the time, but I feel it can take over the flavour profile at times and be too harsh.
M: Quite tart, and bone dry, and has a lingering acidity on the palate. Fairly light-bodied, and has a creaminess in all of the carbonation.
D: In the end a tasty wild ale, but not up there with Supplication, which I think is one of the best beers I've ever had, moderately complex, I'll buy it again next year and delve through it some more. 892 charactersHalcyondays, Apr 21, 2008

Poured into a wine glass, golden color, slightly cloudy with a creamy white head that could pass for whipped egg whites. Aroma of oak, grapes, apples and brett funkiness. Flavors include tart green apples, chardonnay, malt and oak--very well balanced. This blend of flavors combined with a refreshingly smooth, beery mouthfeel makes for a unique and very pleasant imbibing experience. That's fancy talk for "this stuff is damn good." 443 charactersRzzzzz, Apr 20, 2008

S- Smell is definitely has some sourness and barnyard funk but also carries with it some sweet fruits.
T-Taste is sweet and fruity at the beginning followed by deep oaky chardonnay flavor which then rolls into an intense sourness.
M- Very crisp and dry with quite a bit of carbonation.
D- Great one to just sit and sip on. Doesn't get old very fast. Flavor is not as complex as some of the other Russian river beers I have had (Deviation especially) but I like how you don't have to think about it. It just seems pretty straightforward. 629 charactersLothore, Apr 18, 2008

A- This beer pours a slightly cloudy straw color with a massive white head that takes a long time to settle, leaving sheets of web-like lacing on the glass. 
S- Lots of funky sourness along with strong aromas of white wine and oak. There are grassy and floral notes in there too. 
T- Very sour at first, with flavors of white grapes and lemon. The finish leaves a nice oak flavor on the palate. This beer leaves you wanting more after every sip. 
M- A medium-bodied feel with lively carbonation, but the carbonation is light enough to give this a very smooth feeling in the mouth.
D- This is a pure joy to drink. The sourness is intense, but it's balanced out extremely well by the subtle oak flavors. The alcohol is masked very well too. 
One of the best sour beers I've had. A must try. 837 charactersTdizzle, Apr 16, 2008

Pours a semi hazy golden cololr. Surprisingly robust white foam head that lingered for a good five or ten minutes. Like all RR brews, fantastic mouthfeel. Bubbling champagne-esque carbonation that really enhances and lightens the flavor.
The smell is biting and promises a delicious funkiness. Vinegar tones, a citrus zest you can almost taste through your nose, and a hint of yeast.
The taste is explosive. Sour funk, tart unripe applr and fruit, vinegar, and that difficult to explain zesty lemon 570 charactersOverlord, Apr 11, 2008

Gigantic 3 Liter bottle shared at tasting. Huge thanks for the chance to enjoy such a fantastic beer and so much of it! Pours a nice glowing orange color with a lasting foamy and bubly white head. Smell is slightly oak, some bret, and fresh dry citrus rind. Taste was mild, a slightly citrusy quality and very oaky with some mild sourness. Quick finish, and incredibly drinkable, I thought. Thanks again!! 415 charactersJDV, Apr 06, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Hazy straw color with a fizzy white head. Tart fruity aroma with bready yeast. Bright, tart fruit flavors. Vinous with very complex, musty yeast dimension. Lively on the tongue, with deep complexity yet light and bouncy mouthfeel. A champagne-like nutty creaminess mid-palate turns to a crisp and zippy finish, leaving green fruit and soft bitterness in the aftertaste. With warmth it becomes slightly less lively and a bit creamier, and the bready/nutty complexity increases. Overall very interesting and very well done, with all the right subtleties and absolutely no unwanted flavors. 587 charactersbcm119, Apr 05, 2008
4.78/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to JeffKenner for the chance to try this.
A- Poured into a snifter from a 375ml corked and caged bottle noting it is from Batch #002. Pours a bright orange-yellow with a nice white pillowy head. Carbonation bubbles are rising up the beer as it sits. Beautiful beer.
S- This has a nice sour nose but not pungently sour. Some definite funk but not barnyardy. Citrus notes like lemon and orange with a slight grapey nose.
T- I got a hit of the chard grape in the beginning followed by some sour pedio and lacto notes. The finish get a drier and a bit more sour. You get the chard barrel leftovers in this beer very nicely. It isn't overpowering but just right. I get some Brett funk throughout this beer but at no point does it overwhelm the more subtle flavors. This is a great beer. I would like to try this without the wine notes too. 
M- This is a really nice beer in the mouth. The carbonation makes it seem almost creamy when you are drinking it. I can see why they had to recork the bottles b/c this is about max carbonation I would want in a beer. It fits the style perfectly though.
D- This is another stellar offering from Russian River. I cannot wait to try more of their beers in the coming years. I could drink this beer all night. 1,253 charactersMudpuppet, Apr 02, 2008

A: Pours an orangish color with a big fluffy white head. There was a little bit of foaming when the cork was popped but nothing too bad. I did open it very cold as per the instructions on Russian River's site. Excellent lacing as well.
S: Quite a bit of funk in the nose as well as some light fruit.
T: As it usually goes with their brews, this one is entirely one of a kind. Quite complex and very unusual. Quite a bit of fruit: pears, apples, and white grapes. The finish is very tart and dry. 
M: Medium bodied with very fine carbonation.
D: Probably my favorite and the most drinkable of Russian River's wild ales. Definitely worth trying for the unique example of what can be done in the wonderful world of brewing. 830 characterswilljschmidt, Apr 02, 2008

Pours a light golden in color. Has a nice thin head sitting atop.
Taste is almost the perfect combination of sourness and carbonation. This is really enjoyable. There is a definite impact from being aged in wine barrels. There are subtle hints of oak and wine. Nice and medium creamy on the mouthfeel. The Bret is perfectly done here. This is my first Russian River beer, and I'm quite impressed. 406 charactersFtownThrowDown, Feb 24, 2008
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bought a bottle at O'Brien's for $20. The bottle list said this was a 2006 vintage and the bottle stated this was Batch 002.
The beer couldn't wait to get into the Chimay chalice as the foam started gushing out of the bottle. Pours a pineapple juice/apricot color. Surprisingly there is very little foam once it was poured into the glass.
Aroma of pineapple, apple skins, peach, nectarine, strawberry, oak, and pale malt. Funkiness surrounds the entire aroma as well as a leathery combination. A little earthy as well.
The fruits are a little more subtle in the taste than in the aroma, at least at first. First sip revealed sourness upfront with some fruits--apple, peach, nectarine--in the finish. Slightly salty on the tongue. Mostly tart, maybe a little sour, but not lip-puckering sour. Tart cherries and a little vinous. Very good.
Well carbonated and somewhat thin on the finish, but I would call that refreshing. After-taste of apple and grape skins with some funk. Alcohol is very well hidden.
I was surprised to see this one listed and even at $20 it didn't take me long to decide to buy it. The only other wild ale I've had from Russian River is the Toronado 20th on tap and I really wanted to try their other bottled beers. I probably wouldn't buy this one again at this price but I'm really glad I tried it. If I could find this one at a more reasonable price I'd definitely take it. 1,401 charactersseaoflament, Feb 14, 2008

Poured into my Westvleteren chalice last night, sipped on it for about an hour
A-Pale murky yellow color, not much of a head considering the bottle fizzed everywhere when it was opened, very little retention, not much lacing either
S-Lots of brettanomyces, funkiness, faint amount of sour cherries, oak chips, chardonnay, sour apple, and vinegar
T-Lots of funky sourness, big tart right from the beginning, followed by some oak and a dry finish from the Chardonnay, hints of cherries but near as many as Supplication, yeast gave an interesting tarty taste as well, lots of things floating in the bottom of the glass towards the end, easier to drink as it warmed because it became more sweet and less sour, strong sparkling wine feel
M-Dry and sour mouthfeel, pretty thin body, long lasting taste, felt more like a wine of the palate, maybe too much carbonation
D-Could probably drink another bottle, smooth but leaves a dryness, somewhat heavy on the stomach from the overwhelming sweetness, ABV is pretty high for a wild ale as well
Not as great as I expected but still pretty damn good, never had a wild ale that tasted remotely close to this one, could probably use even more age than it had already, recommended 1,352 charactersFloydster, Feb 09, 2008
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 001. 375ml bottle. Pours into my tulip glass a deep golden yellow with nice clarity, fine active carbonation and a creamy white head. Aromas flow out of the glass with sun drenched grains and a fruity profile (green apple). The oak is there with a vinous aroma as well. Brett moves in with a noticeable sourness and an underlying funky, hay/barnyard aroma. Draws me in with its wonderful array of scents.
First sip brings a light sun dried malt with fruity flavors of lemon, citrus and grapes. Oak and woody tannin tones are met by a sourness that flows in. Hay, must and barnyard flavors mix in on the way down. Acidity is there but is well managed and never becomes too much. The Brettanomyces works in so well. Finishes a bit dry. Just an amazing beer.
Mouthfeel is medium to light and arid with mellow carbonation that rolls across the tongue perfectly. Incredibly refreshing and easy to drink. Just an amazing brew overall. I could easily sit down and enjoy a couple of bottles of this to myself and be in heaven. Yet another winner from Russian River, I only wish this wasn't my only bottle. Temptation is worth seeking out and enjoying. 1,151 charactersorbitalr0x, Jan 26, 2008

Several columns of bubbles stream upwards. The head leaves huge chunks of lacing on the glass.
Nose is full of a nice brett funkiness. In the background there are notes of fruity sweetness, champagne tartness, lemon, and a hint of the sour cherry found in Supplication.
Taste is very tart, almost sour. Unripe apple, lemon, lime, and white wine all make an appearance. Mouth puckering and exquisite. 
Just as I thought, the carbonation is beautiful. Russian River is easily king of the Belgian style mouthfeel. Smooth, drying, tart finish. 
If you can handle sour, this beer is very drinkable. I'm glad I have another in the fridge. 786 charactersillidurit, Dec 25, 2007

Smell is all tart with cherry, apple, and wine type aromas. Taste is heavy on the sweetness with some sour notes toward the finish. Mouthfeeling is very dry reminding me more of a fine wine, and less of a beer. I've had some tart beers that are too overpowering this was not one of them.

This little gem cost me a bottle of Dark Lord 2007. Big ups to tangfoot on the trade (yes, it was quite a while ago). The appearance is a cloudy, bright yellow with a nice amount of carbonation, decent white head, and some yeast floating around. Sour grapes and lemon dominate the nose - overall, a very different smelling beer, intriguing to say the least. All kinds of complexity in the taste - white grapes, lemon, orange, and some hints of vanilla sweetness in the end. Totally awesome. Mouthfeel is perfect for this style - rich, creamy, and well carbonated. For as sour as this is, this is one incredibly easy to drink beer. Very tasty. I really wish this stuff was readily available in Michigan. Oh well, may have to start trading again! Highest recommendation. 801 charactersmontageman, Nov 08, 2007

Slight haze suspended in a golden body with blonder, yellower edges. Solid finger of dense, pillowy, glass-crawling, soft white head with good retention. Vibrant complex nose of honeysuckle, lemon juice, chardonnay, wet oak, sweet-tart fruits, pears, sharp sour funk, and old hay. Wonderful; I could smell this all day!
Metallic, dry, cobwebby, acidic taste up front. Tart fruits and fruit skins follow with a citrus bitter sour edge. Pear and grape sweetness round out the palate. There's a pronounced funk throughout that goes very well. Oaky, vinous finish with some leftover fruits. Mostly dry. Medium body feels bigger due to lively carbonation and a very long aftertaste.
Wow. A fantastic beer that is well worth the price/trading/traveling. I would love to have easy access to this gem! 864 charactersalexgash, Nov 06, 2007
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 002. This is about a year since bottling, which I guess makes it about 2 years since it found it's way into the barrel for the first time. Foamed up just a bit after uncorking, as expected based on their website bottle log. Pours a pretty clear golden, but gets a bit hazy with the addition of some of the fine yeast particles. The bright white head foamy head didn't have much retention in my glass. The smell at first, when very cold is lots of wine-y chardonnay. As it warms up and if you release the aroma by swirling you can get an ever so slight barnyard funkiness to it. The taste is the classic brett sourness with a (for lack of better term because I know next to nothing about wine) a white wine type taste (I've had chardonnay before so I can see how it is similar). The barrel aging in chardonnay barrels really added a great quality to compliment the sourness of the brett.
The mouthfeel is great in this beer. Very light and plenty carbonated as it should be. Spritzy if you will. The drinkability is very good. The sourness doesn't limit it too much as I would say it does in the very good but very acidic Supplication that burns my throat. Once again a great sour beer by Russian River... they can't go wrong, even if they tried.

Batch 003.
Crystal clear gold, bubbly, lacy wispy foamy bright white head. Smell is tart and slightly fruity, faint strawberry. There is a mildly musty smell, like that you get from a blue cheese, which actually becomes quite prominent as the beer opens up. The taste starts out like the chardonnay barrels it was aged in, with a moderate tartness, and finishes very clean without puckering. A belgian yeast fruitiness is left in the aftertaste. The woody character seems pretty low.

Slightly hazy, orange liquid. Looks like it glows! Small, off-white, creamy head. Not much lacing or legs.
Aroma conjured up citrus, aspirin and floral notes. Some musty/funk in there. Grapes and wine also come to mind.
Taste is tart/sour -- Hello, Brett! Citrus and lemon. Hint of something sweet in there, rather faint, back to the grapes/wine (chardonay). Very bitter finish/aftertaste, aspirin again. Alcohol is there, but not overdone.
Light to medium body. Medium + carbonation. Pretty dry, especially in finish and aftertaste. ABV warming is slow and steady.
I have not been a big fan of Brett/sour beers, but I think I'm starting to like these damn things. Maybe not on a regular basis, but they sure are a heck of a change up. Very complex, tart-but not dominating, a good beer for people who want to explore the sour stuff. 863 characters, Oct 08, 2007

The cry goes out - "Horse Blanket!" Sharp and acidic tastes dominate. Cannot distinguish what is what. All I can compare this to is the Sanctification I had the same night. This is like a more concentrated version of that beer. Perhaps too much. Mouthfeel is fine, but the overpowering acidic tartness makes this much more of a sipping beer. Very nice, but I prefer the Sanctification. 513 charactersOnibubba, Oct 04, 2007

Pour: A quick fading champagnish head gives way to a gorgeous hazy golden orange body. Whisps of foam cling to the sides glass, some yeast percolates to the bottom. 
Smell: Nose is one of apricots and sour grapes, with hints of the bret lurking in the background.
Taste: Definitelty no let down here! Crisp pineapple and orange citrus flavors explode upon the taste buds. Carbonation is exactly where it should be. Oak and chardonnay creep through and are met nicely with the bret which is does not dominate but provides enormous complexity to this beer. There is no barnyard funkiness here, rather the balance here is absolutely amazing. Everything is controlled yet I marvel at the depth of this brew. 
Finish: This may be my ownly quip with this beer is that it leaves a sour funkiness in the mouth. Not a real clean finish here. Would need to rinse before swithing to a different brand as the taste lingers for a while
Vinny is true master of brewing and his creations have not disappointed. Temptation is a must for wild ale lovers and connoisseurs of craft beer. 1,211 charactersthe_beerist, Sep 29, 2007

Well I've been hanging on to this bottle for... well... too long. When I bought it I grabbed the last bottle of Supplication, but there were two bottles of Temptation, and I didn't buy the second. WHY?! Just because I don't have a great way to cellar? This is drinking great as it is!
Well, now I know.
Batch 002:
Pours a beautiful golden blonde with relatively thin, if frothy head, just a hint of haze.
Smells, as it warms, like goodness in a glass. The chardonnay characteristics/similarities are marked, but there's a little hint of spice and fruity warmth. This has been poured into a globe red wine glass, and it's heaven just below the rim.
First few sips are a bit disappointing, it's too cold. Flavor is crisp and refreshing, but thin and lacking depth. The beer's fault? No... mine. 
After warming, the intriguing complexities come bursting forth... the oak is relatively muted, but the brew is incredibly vinous... the sourness, which I was expecting to be much more forward, is really only present in the very back of the palate, making this crisp and refreshing. If anything, I'm a bit disappointed by the carbonation, as I at points wish this sat more comfortably on the tongue (like wine) to allow more savoring. Balance is perfect, finishes clean and dry after a touch of sweetness up front... this isn't wacking you over the head with any big flavors, but the sum total is superb.
Would love to see 750s of this available more frequently... I had this at the end of an evening, but this would make an amazing aperitif, and would pair well with anything a good white wine would. 2,016 characterserrantnight, Sep 20, 2007
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A rush of head erupted from the bottle about five seconds after opening the bottle. A tall, foamy white head was produced pouring this beer that quickly dropped to a thin layer. The body is a golden and hazy yellow shade with a few chunks of yeast floating around. 
The nose of this beer is sharp with many floral characteristics. A mild bitterness takes over the nose as aromas of cinnamon and allspice blend. Overall this beer smells great and it is very hard to describe. The smell is more like a lambic than a blonde ale. 
A smooth vanilla flavor misleads the senses before a sharp and powerful, funky yeast flavor takes hold. The funk is very much like a Flanders Red Ale from the brit only it is a bit smoother. The finish holds most of the complexity that this beer has to offer. Flavors of pear and pomargranate blend with citrus and smoked beef for an interesting and delicious combination. I don't think that I've ever tasted a beer like this before. 
The mouthfeel of this beer is much like white wine. The body is relatively thin with a great carbonated feel. The acidity and sharpness provide a very lively feel. 
Drinkability is tough to measure. This is meant to be contemplated so it is a slow-drinking beer. It is enjoyable and likely the most unique beer that I've encountered to date. 1,315 charactersBudlum, Aug 25, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5"The only way to handle temptation successfully is to yield to it."
--French proverb
Batch 001. Temptation is precisely midway between lemon peel and ripe apricot. The highest compliment that I can pay the gorgeous, alabaster colored crown is to say that it would look at home on the finest Belgian ale. It becomes even more attractive as it slowly descends, leaving the glass positively coated with delicate lace.
Unlike some Brettanomyces-infused beer, the nose is full of barnyard funkiness without being completely dominated by it. It's easy to appreciate ripe golden fruit and the Chardonnay oakiness that was imparted by 12 month's contact with the barrels. 'Sublime' is the one word that keeps coming to mind whenever I put my nose over the glass.
How does Russian River manage to brew such amazing beer, again and again and again? The fact that Vinnie Cilurzo is the mastermind behind what I consider the best beer the world has ever seen (Pliny The Younger), yet is still able to create a stunningly complex Belgian-style ale like Temptation boggles the mind.
Even without the Brett, this would be an outstanding example of a golden ale. The fact that it's even possible to determine that is further evidence that the wild yeast doesn't steamroll everything in its path, but complements the beer in the best way possible.
The flavor profile consists of barely ripe apples, pears and peaches (complete with their natural sugars), a potpourri of spices (clove and white pepper especially), a surprising amount of sweetgrassy hoppiness and a perfect Brettanomyces puckery tang that wraps things up in a perfect ribbon of drinkability. Why oh why didn't they put this stuff in 750s?
Despite the label's advice to 'allow the natural yeast sediment to remain in the bottle', I'll do no such thing. The final pour clouds things up nicely and puts the already fandamntastic flavor into orbit. I can say without hesitation that Temptation is the best wild ale that has ever entered my glass.
The mouthfeel, while not up to the standards of Belgium's best, isn't far behind. Perfection would be easily achieved with a fraction more expansiveness. It's hard to argue with beer that is this lightly silky and this zestily carbonated.
I don't like to repeat myself, but it's a damn shame that this delicious ale isn't released in bigger bottles (I'm thinking jeroboams at least). It's also too bad that Russian River will no longer ship to us poor souls outside of Northern California who aren't able to otherwise experience the transcendence of their beer. I'm glad that I decided to yield to Temptation today. 2,616 charactersBuckeyeNation, Aug 19, 2007

Batch 002
Poured a beautiful, glowing, deep golden yellow with a two-finger, pure white, sea foam head. The head slowly faded to a frothy dollop of foam that sat in the middle of the liquid. Large, bubbly blankets of lacing crept down the sides of the glass.
The aroma was very crisp, sour and a touch musty. Funky Brettanomyces yeast were immediately recognizable, and they lent an earthy and dry quality to the nose. White wine notes (as produced from the Chardonnay barrel aging) also lingered in the background.
The taste was citric, sour and quite funky as well. Once again, the Brettanomyces were ever present. Oaky, earthy and barnyardy notes also came through strong. The Brett yeast gave off strong, slightly acidic, lemony notes. The beer finished remarkably clean, dry and tannic (and surprisingly refreshing).
Body was medium/thin with a spritzy yet moderate carbonation.
This beer was truly everything I anticipated and more. An extreme beer like this begs to be savored with foods equally as interesting. Try pairing it with a plate of raw milk morbier cheese, green grapes and white flesh peaches for the perfect summertime afternoon snack. 1,259 charactersDamian, Aug 14, 2007

The bottle is interesting in itself with the odd ml size, dippled bottom like a wine bottle and long slender neck. The label has a story about the beer. Poured into my Chimay goblet. It has a hazy golden yellow color with just a few bits of yeast floating around. It had a small head that turned into a constant partial film that was fed by a carb geyser. The aroma was amazing. I love sour beers and this had a great sour beer smell. It was heavy on the brett but you could also get a good hit of the oak and some lemon in the back. The taste was also exceptional. Nice and sour with a carb attack on the tongue. Reminds me of Le Terrior from NBB. Mouthfeel is great with good sour bite and carbonation. Overall, I loved this one and highly recommend. Can't wait to try it and some other RR wild ales again. (5, RR, T, Y) 867 charactersTexIndy, Aug 11, 2007

The aroma is dominated by brett and underlaid by lemon/citrus and a light, slightly caramelized sugar smell.

Things dry out completely by the finish, which is full of sourness that lingers for a while on the tongue. Big, soft carbonation and, in spite of the largesse of the acidity, phenomenal balance throughout.

a: The pour into my oversized snifter gives a low white head that soon clears the surface, leaving a ring and a sparse head that reappears when the glass is swirled. The beer is a bright, cotton honey golden in color.
s: Wow. Notes of fresh, crisp white wine with a wonderful bacterial funk. The funk is great in that it is, for lack of a better word, clean...in almost a weak, sweet malt vinegar kinda way. An ever so slight touch of pale grain brings it back from the wine side and gives a perfectly light sweetness. Hints of tart green apple and crabapple, white grape, and much more. Papery, aged hop aroma. Description won't really do this one justice. So good. Really enjoying the barrel influence on this beer. Perfect level of alcohol. Perfect all around and very tastefully done. 
m: High though smooth carbonation, with a body on the light side of the medium range that is very clean...and certainly dry in the finish.
t: Beautifully blended complexity. Tart flavors of underripe green apple from the perfect application of bacteria brings to mind, expectedly, white wine. The pale malts take a backseat here, which is all fine and good as the end result is a very subtly rich beer. Low hop profile add just a slight papery flavor. Finish is near perfect, thanks in no small part to the tart character.
d: Very easy drinkability, and definitely a treat. I could sit here for an hour and try to describe this thing to a t, but I'd rather sit back and enjoy it. Gonna age the other bottle another year or more. Get some.
3-6-2007: Second bottle from my bombing, Batch 001. Things don't seem to have changed too much, perhaps more brett tartness...still a wonderful beer. No scoring changes made. 1,768 charactersblackie, Jul 09, 2007

375 mL bottle, Batch 002, poured into a tulip glass. 
Pours a murky bright corn yellow with a fluffy two finger white head that seems to stay forever, and I mean forever. Lacing is great, nothing to complain about here. Smell is of very light fruit odors; apple, pear, lime, white grape, and some apricot. Very faint vanilla oak flavors in the nose as well. Taste starts off with a lime tartness blended with a dirty earth hop flavor. Definite metallic notes linger on the lips from the frothy head that just won't go away. Vanilla like alcohol presence in the aftertaste from the wine barrels with a nice bready malt smoothness. Such a complex flavored brew. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very clean and fresh from start to finish. Drinkiability is pretty good, I could share these with friends for a night. My first Wild Ale, can't wait to try the Supplication next! 948 charactersBeerTruth, Jun 21, 2007

The color was darker than I thouht it would be. Golden brown/red color. The smell was amazing. You could smell the tartness of the beer. The beer tasted awesome. It had a crisp tartness too it not too overpowering like a Cantillon but more crisp like Flemish Sour. The tartness stayed on the tounge but disappeared quickly. 
I wish ther were more of this around because I would drink it every day. 518 charactersmymrnngjckt, Jun 07, 2007

You can smell this one from across the room. Sour grapes and pungent yeast with slight sugar.
Taste is sour right up front. This was well worth the troube to acquire. Lemon peel and alum. Just a good sour white wine like Katz just not as sweet.
Mouthfeel is very clean. Bursts of flavor keep the palate enthused and ready for the next drink.
If I could get this one and it wasn't so expensive it would be a great session brew. This would go good with seared tuna steaks over garden greens. mmm 587 characterspeabody, May 21, 2007

Straw color, fairly clear, a finger of whitish head. Some classically lacy looking lace.
Big bretty and fruity smell - barnyard funk, pineapple, white grape juice, lemon, grassy hops. Hints of rosewater, honey and shortbread.
Tastes mainly of sour fruit, particularly pineapple, but not overwhelmingly sour, and spicy funky yeast. Some restrained grassy/herbal hop flavor and bitterness. Some discernible sweetness, quite restrained and well balanced. White wine character. Some oak, but restrained and well integrated. The sweetness disappears and the tartness picks up. Long dry finish, spicy yeasty pineapple, with astringency like black tea. Refreshing, balanced, wonderful.
Extremely fine carbonation, with acidity and astringency adding to the impression of substance.
Very drinkable, refreshing.
Very nice beer, well worth seeking out. 950 charactersBeerzebub, May 17, 2007

Carbonation was insane, tons of visible bubble streams coming off the bottom. Almost looked like, well it really did look like champagne. Bubbles everywhere.	
S - Very strong pungent aroma comes off of this one. Huge smell of grapes, with a hint of alcohol. Maybe a hoppy presence trying to come through. Smells like wine.
M & T - First impression was very sour, and it tasted like a nice white wine. Lots of carbonation and great feel, very light, again almost like champagne. 
D - Overall this was very intresting and a good one time try, but not really my cup of tea. Would not turn it down if it was offered, but would not go out of my way to purchase it, a nice novelty at least for me. 767 charactersmikesgroove, May 12, 2007
4.49/5  rDev +1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Order this one up at the Brickskeller in DC. My first run-in with an American Wild Ale.
A: Poured a tawny amber hue topped by a quaint half-inch head that dissipated rather quickly.
S: Pale malt and Brett smell, rather yeasty and sour. The winey Chardonnay oak came through, mixing with what basically smelled like a pilsner gone bad. Damn interesting though, unlike anything I've ever smelled.
T: A somewhat unassuming taste at the very front, but the smooth malt flavor is replaced by a yeasty and sour Brett-flavored bonanza. Oaky characteristics present, and this does resemble wine. Finish yields an ultra dry ending, with a hoppy and yeast-filled lingering flavor on the palate. The complexity is insane, and I actually found myself enjoying the sourness.
M: A well-carbonated beer with a lighter body to it, but still retains a fullness of flavor. The mouthfeel brings out the array of tastes.
D: A bit of a challenge at first, but a very enjoyable offering once you get into it and really seek out the different flavors. Sitting back and soaking in the complex nature of this really contributed to another awesome time at the 'skeller. 1,158 charactersCharlieMopps, May 11, 2007
4.03/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 002.
Pours a clear gold color with a light and fluffy head reasting on top. Second pour was a tad murkier from some yeast sediment. Nose is light and sweet. Slight citrus tang to it.
Solid flavor. Great beer to enoy all night long. Light citrus tartness hangs over this beer and comes out more prominently as it warms. Littls bits of pepper. Also, I can pick out some oakiness but honestly I am not sure what it brings to this beer. Maybe a bot more smoothness and body. Light mouthfeel and quite vinuous. 517 charactersMuddyFeet, May 03, 2007
4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This one pours from 375ml caged and corked bottle(batch 002)..ooops! I turned the bottle sideays to read some of the info and when I popped the cork, the beer shot out of the bottle big time. My bad. :^(
Anywho, it pours a cloudy straw yellow with a large head of foam that shrinks slowly leaving a solid layer with plenty of lacing.
The smell is all fruity, and yeasty, and funky. Fruit wise, I can smell lemon and some apricot and it's very inviting indeed. 
The taste on first sip has a BIG sour punch and a ton of citrus flavours. Lots of grapefruit, apricot and lemon tartness permeate my every taste bud and I can *only* smile. A very BIG smile. Swishing the Ale in my mouth, it gets even more complex. Big yeast notes, strong representation of funk, and a never ending stream of a variety of fruit...man, the flavours are simply outstanding. Yum. Talk about a Wild Ale, in the future, when I see or hear that term used, I'll instantly think of RR Temptation. 
The mouthfeel is superb, the carbonation is light, the drinkability is through the roof...I kid you not. The finish is very lemony and you just want the aftertaste to *never* end. And as far as the 7.25%abv comes in to play, there's no evidence of it in the tasting and there's almost no warming as it goes down. An amazing brew. 
Bottom line: Yet another fantastic brew from Russian River. If I ever visit California again, visiting RR Brewing would be a must. My BA hat is off to them! 1,469 charactersBitterbill, Apr 29, 2007
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours a hazy yellow orange in a goblet. A nice one finger white head that fades quickly and forms a nice retention.
Smell: Major notes of citrus tart, musty, and oak. The citrus seems to be of grapes and pineapple and banana. There are some spices, but I can't put my finger on it.
Taste: It starts off a bit strange due to an initial vinegar taste. The fruit really balances well with the more wine like qualities of the beer. There is some nice breadiness that provides the backbone here and some sugary notes as well. This warms beautifully and you can really taste all the subtle nuances of the flavors.
Mouthfeel: Lively and active. The sour and oak lingers nicely.
Drinkability: Absolutely wonderful. Refreshing and moderate alcohol content. 771 charactersstereosforgeeks, Apr 20, 2007
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The beer poured a hazy straw yellow with a beautiful frothy head that lasted and left great lacing. The aroma was of strong hefe-weizen characteristics, only stronger than any hefe I've ever encountered. As far as the taste, if you can take the sourness, as I could, this is one of the most complex beers I've ever encountered. Once you look past the sour, there is an interesting blend of German hefe and Belgian Tripel characteristics. In the mouth, the sourness is a bit overbearing, but I'm able to appreciate that it goes with the style. This is certainly a beer that takes some effort to appreciate, but I must say, it's worth the effort. This is the first beer of this style I've ever had, and it certainly leaves me wanting to try more. 744 charactersatsprings, Apr 17, 2007

a - bright golden/amber color, nice haze, big white head with good retention and lacing
s - aroma is very similar to champagne, big sour notes with some apple and pear, some funk from the Brett, only slight alcohol, hints of oak
t - slightly yeasty right up front before a big sourness evolves, lots of sour apple and lemon, big Brett notes that just sit on the tongue for awhile, nice hints of oak, finish is fruity, lemon mostly with some other citrus, no alcohol whatsoever in the taste, just a lingering sourness/funkiness and fruit along with some oak, awesome
m - lots of carbonation, light-bodied, finish is more sweet than dry
d - I couldn't believe that I went through the bottle so fast, I would have thought the sourness would limit the drinkability more than it does
It's hard for me to choose a favorite between this and Supplication...both are amazing. Hopefully Vinnie still has some Temptation on hand when I'm at RR in a few months. 1,048 charactersWeisGuy, Apr 14, 2007
4.21/5  rDev -4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy. cloudy almost straw like pale yellow in color. Brilliant head and carbonation kept a 3 finger head around for quite a while. 
First whiff reminded me a lot of french champagne, deep woody notes followed by a hint of alcohol and almost leathery scent. 
Taste was a very dry malt backbone balanced by tart fruit, hints of apple, cherries, lemon and a puckering finish with the brett aftertaste. 
From its smell I was expecting this beer to be unbalanced by the heavy brett and alcohol but found it to blend together quite well and the alcohol to be unnoticeable once I drank it. Mouthfeel is light and crisp making this a fantasticly drinkable beer, except for the pricetag. 
Overall, very pleasing, not unlike a fine champagne. 754 charactersFlyFisher2782, Apr 12, 2007

Tart Bret character in the nose, along with ripe apples and a gentle woodsiness. Flavor is spot on - Bret does not overpower, it is about as subtle as Bret gets, in my experience. Vinous character gives over to a light oak and lemon zest finish. Had this and Supplication in the same day, my first brews from RR, and they have immediately become one of my favorite brewers. 488 charactersBlastTyrant, Apr 03, 2007
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 002. Bottle has tendency to foam over.
Hazy yellow color with a white head, decent retention. Smell includes some lemon, soft sourness, oak, and there seemed to be a very light spice that I'm unable to name. Taste has sour oak, lemon, and some other citrus flavors, slightly acidic, with a fairly dry finish. Not as sour as others I have enjoyed, but still quite good. Mouthfeel had high carbonation with a light body. Light body and dry finish to this, paired with its excellent taste make this one highly drinkable. I wish I had plenty more; would be great for special occasions.
Update: This beer has gotten better and better. Just marvelous. 653 charactersbadbeer, Apr 01, 2007

Aprearance is a hazy golden yellow. Thin whispy white head but not much.
Aromas of white wine, spices, pepper, lemon, grassy, wet hay, buttery oak.
Taste is light biscuity, cookie-like malt with strong citrussy, lemony, white wine character. Buttery oak and cookie flavors blend well with the sharp sour chardonnay character.
Mouthfeel is light, sharp and carbonic.

4.64/5  rDev +5.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle of batch 2 carried home from RR by a friend. (Danke Jeremy!) Served in a large Tripel Karmeliet glass.
Beer is hazy golden with virtually no head (surprising given the spritzy nature of the brew)
Aroma is bright lemony and spicy with cinnamon oaky notes riding over a low old wet hay 
Flavor is a first hit of a carbonic acid bite that drives right into a heavy cinnamon spice with a light biscuit malt flavor that finishes with a light pleasant hop bite mixed with a lingering sourness. 517 charactersdrewbage, Feb 25, 2007
3.85/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pale yellow appearance, with a slight chill haze. Pillowy white foam stretches a bit thin, but leaves a nice crust, however. Abundant streams of carbonation are visible, like a steady, upside down rain shower. The aroma is yeasty, vinegary, and tart. Light notes of sour lemon and fresh bread also present, nice. 
The taste is alot less sour than expected, with an overriding fruitiness that is mostly like grapefruit with some other citrus and melon character. Some notes of dry grass and barnyard hay are also evident. The finish becomes dry and some light oak notes come out while a light sourness remains at the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is light, and semi-foamy. Decent, but not spectacular.
I've had a couple bottles of this now, and each time I feel like it doesn't live up to expectations. To me it's not sour enough, and the sourness it does carry lingers in the finish annoyingly rather than making you pucker waiting for the next sip. It took awhile to finish the bottle which suprised me. With Beatification and Sanctification I could hardly contain myself. The flavor of this beer sort of hangs in the balance, wanting to be something more. I wonder if Batch 001 was better, but I probably will never know. For a wild ale it's good, for Russian River it's average... 1,293 charactersbennetj17, Feb 23, 2007
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375 ml punted green bottle, corked and caged. Batch 002. I was thinking that I'd wait until the weather was more spring-like to open up my first Russian River "wild ale," but then I remembered I'm in Buffalo, and that won't be until June...It was sunny for most of the day today, so what the hell. Anyway, served at cellar temperature in a Russian River Barrel Aged Ales stemmed glass, Temptation is a cloudy golden-straw color, with a sudsy dull-white head which is clingy but recedes to a surface film rather quickly. Aromas are on the sharp side, with green apple, musty phenols, and acidic Chardonnay scents standing out the most. A tart "lambic" smell is also noticeable -- brettanomyces at work, I imagine. An extremely tart "lambic" edge greets the palate at first. This acidic funk greeting is followed by a more variegated citrus blend, with lemon and lime flavors predominating. A very faint biscuity flavor appears both somewhere in the middle and briefly in the aftertaste. Rubbery phenol notes waft in at random throughout mid-sip. Some white wine fruitiness comes through as the beer warms with an initially detectable mineral twang subsiding at the same time. Minimal touches of oak tannins near the finish, which is mouth-puckeringly dry. Light body with a slightly sticky but overall airy and smooth mouthfeel. This is a fascinatingly complex ale, and I'm glad to have the rest of this bottle to finish this evening. However, I think it's more appropriately drunk in weather warmer than today's snow-blanketed 20 degree February business. Would likely pair nicely with a super-stinky cheese. 1,608 charactersorfeu, Feb 19, 2007
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Crosling for this bottle.
A: Pours a hazy golden with a bubbly head like champagne. Not much sustain on the head, but good lacing.
S: Brett, dirty socks, and cheap white wine. Not bad though.
T: Definitely a wild ale, but the brett is a bit less pronounced than in the Suplication. The barrel aging aging offers a bit of complexity. Perhaps I'm just getting used to these styles with wild fermentation, but this one doesn't taste as funky as some.
M: Crisp and acidic like white wine. Medium-bodied with a very active carbonation that continues to bubble in the mouth.
D: Not as good as Supplication, but still damn good. The lesser brett quality makes this one very easy drinking. Highly recommended. 726 charactersklewis, Feb 13, 2007
4.88/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5375 mL olive brown cork-n-crown bottle. Batch 002, brewed on 6/11/05 with house Belgian and abbey yeasts, unfiltered, and aged for 16 months in French oak chardonnay barrels with saccharo- and brettanomyces. It was bottled on 11/15/06, and conditioned with their house wine yeast and more brettanomyces. It pours a transluscent gold with medium to high carbonation and two inches of white head that settles at an eighth of an inch and leaves sheets of sticky lace. Very nice - it is reminiscent of a well-crafted Belgian. The aroma is also quite Belgian - fruity, oaky, and winey, with the addition of sour and lightly funky overtones. If it were a bit more aromatic it would warrant a five in the category. On the palate there are notes of pale or pilsner malts and green (noble?) hops blended very nicely with a brett sourness and touches of white wine here and there. There are additional notes of grassy/spicy hops, a medium sourness, a mild (but increasing) bitterness, some drying tannins, and oaky/winey notes that increase near the end. So complex and completely delicious. The medium body is drying and lightly numbing, incredibly smooth, and has medium carbonation along with a medium to long finish. Overall an awesome, very drinkable and refreshing beer (a non-stop sipper) that is a testament to the creativity of the American craft beer revolution. 1,362 charactersmmmbeer, Feb 13, 2007
3.9/5  rDev -11.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4App: Golden yellow with hints of orange. Had a thin white head that stuck to the sides and provided a minimal lacing.
Smell: Musty oak, a hint of apple and grape. Smelled a little like wine. The aroma wasn't very intense, unfortunately.
Taste: The apple and grape come through again, along with the oak to provide a very wine like experience. This was very similar to a lambic, but without a lot of the tastes I would be expecting. When I took a quick sip, the oak came through a little too heavily.
Mouthfeel: Very sour and tart, kinda like sucking down a warhead candy. There was good carbonation and it was highly enjoyable to let this sit on my tongue and think about it.
Drinkability: After each sip I found myself wanting more of this beer. It was complex and tasty, but not so much to keep me from wanting another bottle or two. 847 charactersdbalsock, Feb 09, 2007
4.02/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a hazy, golden hue with a generous 1/2" head which slowly subsides... very effervescent... like a hazy champagne.
Musty aroma... the oak is very prevalent, along with some citrus. Interesting... don't think I've ever smelled anything like it, and for that I give it high marks.
Tight, sour kick... so champagne-y and wine-y... I am amazed at this brew... it defies the boundaries of beer-dom as we know it. Fantastic. A big oaky thickness goes along with the sourness... nice and complex... I'm a fan.
While I'm not typically a fan of highly carbonated beers, this one works well because of the similarities it shares with champagne.
While delicious, this beer is not an easy drinker. The tart of the brew makes it a sipper. One to appreciate.. not to gulp. Fantasticly unique. Next stop.... Jolly Pumpkin. 824 charactersnickss, Feb 08, 2007

Popped the cork and it foamed out all over my table. damn. i almost sucked beer out of the tablecloth but decided against it. Got the rest into a couple of glasses for me and the wife. Looked clear and orange/yellow with a little white lace head. little floating sediment-y things bobbing aorund in it like they're alive (and they might just be). Smells musty and a bit like an old sweet champagne. Also some clementine-like citrus on the nose. Taste starts out thin and orangey and wine-like. A bit like a cyser i had on tap at Bell's in terms of the initial flavor profile. Some sourness that builds as the beer warms. Citrusy astringency. bitterness grows as it warms, which melds well with the orange flavor. some light alcohol flavor is apparant too. thin, effervescent mouthfeel. All in all, it's an interesting beer and the first i've had from the style i think so i'll remember it. I could go either way on having another though....it's tasty but not something i feel like i could ever crave. 1,108 charactersaforbes10, Feb 02, 2007

Aromas of yeast, mellon, white raisins, and old bread seemed to come out. The taste was balanced between 'brett' flavors and crisp hops. Raisins and other fruit flavors melted right in adding great depth. Not as funky as other AWA, but still a touch of that funky/spoiled taste. Overall, quite interesting and enjoyable, but not one that I could have over and over again. 440 charactersjaluria, Feb 01, 2007
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pour: 375 ml bottle (XXX Batch 2) to tulip glass. A bright yet cloudy apricot liquid cascades into my glass, peaked by an inch of white head. The fluff sinks down quickly to a big cap and halo of remains.
Nose: Tartness explodes out of the bottle with the pop of the cork. Extremely sour: mouth watering and puckering. Notes of black pepper, coriander, broiled meats.
Mouth: Sour and delicious entrance with a strange, warm and salty after taste. In the mouth it's hard to pick the hops from the malts - it's more of a yeast and mold flavor. Same broiled steak taste as implied in the aroma. Extremely strong and active carbonation. As the brew warms more depth appears, adding fruit and berry notes along with a farmy hay flavor. 736 charactersclickpush, Jan 25, 2007
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I've dabbled some in the wild ale / gueze category over the past couple of years. I'm finding some common themes in what I like as well as what I don't. This one is definitely in the yes I like it category. I ordered these from the website after reading some of the BA reviews. A leap of faith, yes, but oh what a temptation :-)
A - bottle and label looked neat with a nice description on the back. Wire cage broke as I tried to unwind it. A careful pour yields a hazy yellow brew with a billowy white head.
S - Wow, a lot of stuff packed into that whiff. Light chardonay wine, sour lactic / lemon, a touch of belgian candi / sweet malt and a earthyness. That's from a few minutes enjoying the aroma. There's a lot going on with this one.
T - Similar to the aroma but with a better kick in sour aspects and a diminished subtle chardonay effect that is nicely complimentary. I can't wait to have one of these this summer in the warm weather! I think that even at low winter cellar temps warming to room temp this beer could use a bit warmer day to really let loose.
M - light to medium bodied, very carbonated and nicely tangy
D - nice refreshing drink. I think a bit diminished as a winter drink but very tasty. Nice how while complimentary tart / sour, this one is not an over the top blow your head off sour brew.
I've heard from a couple of brewers that it can take a few years to really let the brett do it's thing before these beers are ready. My hat's off to RR for taking the time to do it right as well as create a novel flavor combination that's got me anticipating summer for the rest of the brews in the cellar. Buy em in bulk from the brewery if you are not local. At the price they sell em, it's easy money! 1,738 charactersbarleywinebrewer, Jan 25, 2007

If you look at the bottling notes at Russian River's website, 002 of Temptation had to be aired and re-corked because it was so lively, and even with that re-corking this thing pops off in a deceivingly friendly manner with some haze, then proceeds to spill over. As it was doing so, I noticed that there are actual portions of brownish silt-like stuff, assumingly the Brett or another yeast, all over this beer. Knowing that the Brett makes the beer, I decided to keep as much of this stuff in my glass as possible. 
Pours with a two or three finger's worth of extremely lively head, which settles down to a half-finger after some time. Lacing is absolutely fucking brilliant. Huge dangling arms of the stuff, forming downright artistic patterns all over the sides of my glass. The body is a hazy sun yellow which invites at the same time as it imparts a feeling that the Brett lies in waiting to kick your tastebuds into submission. Wonderful for the lacing alone.
Smell: Oh my god. This is possibly the single most complex beer I've ever had the pleasure of whiffing. Let me make a feeble attempt: Vanilla, oak, whiskey, apple, banana, cane sugar, chardonnay, lavender, a variety of scented candle aromas I'm having trouble isolating (largely due to my lack of general aroma familiarity), rosemary, nutmeg, cinnamon, "new car smell," hint of leather, hint of polish, fig, plum, pear, cream, some coconut... I'm getting olfactory fatigue here. Absolutely phenomenal.
Taste: Buttered popcorn, chardonnay, banana, apple cider, green apples, 
nutmeg, grapes, cream, some sugar. A residual oakey chardonnay back end. I really, really enjoy the flavor, as it reveals similar complexity but with more amplification of the some of the individual flavors present in the nose. Perhaps slightly less complex than the nose, that being said.
Mouthfeel: Thick, bubbling, light and fizzy meringue-like stuff. Great.
Drinkability: Incredibly drinkable. No perceptible alcohol from my perspective. I am absolutely floored by this beer, and will be searching ardently for the RR's other Wild Ales. 2,296 charactersRidiculedDisplay, Jan 24, 2007
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to ClockworkOrange for the chance to try this highly touted offering from RR. Batch 002.
A: Pours a very cloudy golden color with hints of grapefruit. Frothy champagnelike one finger white head has excellent retention. Amazing lacing all over the glass.
S: Woody oak notes coupled with chardonnay aromas. Floral presence with a sourness that overtakes the rest of the notes. Sour tartness gives the rest of the softs flavors a jolt.
T/M: Tart like sourness right from the get go. Chardonnay mixes in but isn't overly powerful. Wine notes aren't necessarily as big as the tart sourness. A tad woody floral and fruity notes. Lemon zest, orange and grapefruit rind, pears...very complex. Very smooth once it starts to warm up--almost too smooth. Medium bodied. 
D: Somewhat drinkable--not because it's bad, but because it's so complex. this is definitely a sipping brew and one that needs to be discussed whilst doing so. Extremely happy I've had the chance to sample this. 987 charactersbjohnson, Jan 23, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer made me smile...nuff said, but I'll say more.
It poured a golden yellow with a nice white head that sat just high enough to look funny in a pinot noir glass.
The aroma was bleeding Chardonnay and Oak into my nostrils and I couldn't get enough of it. This beer smells so good you don't even have to drink it. But do.
The flavor was Gueze-esque with lots of oak, grape (chardonnay), a little acidity which was right on. This is one of those beers that you will most likely have a love/hate experience with. I feel sorry for those that hate it. This beer made a Chimay cheese that we had sitting on the table (that no one was eating cause it smelled like dead worms and feet) become the most incredible thing in the world. Perfect pairing.
The mouthfeel of this is perfect. light/med body with just enough carbonation to enhance the acidity (and make the aroma humungous) enough to give it that wine quality that I feel is what really makes this beer.
The drinkability is near perfect for myself. Near zero for someone who is expecting your traditional beer out of this. 1,092 charactersBrian700, Jan 22, 2007

Batch 002
Corked and caged.
Poured into a chalice a nice cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, nice small foamy white head, leaves some nice islands and sticky lacing. The nose is of malts, hops, yeast, citrus (orange, grapefruit), pears, apples, and grapes. The taste is sweet with a nice tangyness to it, fruity and a nice dryness to the finish. Very carbonated, medium body, a complex brew. Very drinkable, this is my second RR brew to date, love both of them. Highly recommended. 525 charactersWasatch, Jan 21, 2007

4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presentation: 375 ml champagne bottle, corked and caged. Lots of information about the beer, including batch #, description, glassware suggestions, and pouring instructions (leave the yeast).
Appearance: Poured carefully to avoid the yeast into a goblet. Resulted in a bright yellow with just a hint of orange color, and a light haze. Medium sized head fades slightly, but has great retention and lacing.
Smell: Mmm.. sour! There are so few good sour beers available in the US that the smell of Brett is so novel and exciting. Typical sour funk with some barnyard smells.
Taste: More subtle than I expected from the aroma. So much going on here it is hard to pick out all the details. Starts out sour with a lot of carbonation in the mouthfeel. The finish has a bit of oak and all kinds of other things that I can't identify.
Overall impression: Once again, a quality offering from Russian River. Incredibly complex, unique, and all kinds of great flavors going on. Why oh why can't more American brewers put out beers like this! 1,041 charactersrowew, Jan 17, 2007
3.53/5  rDev -20%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3A: Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a very active bubbly white head that recedes quite quickly and leaves only a trace of lacing. 
S: Smells more of wine or cider than it does beer. Very floral smelling, along with sugary malts and a mix of spices.
T: Not exactly what I was expecting, very much like a white wine. It starts out with a bit of a sugary malt flavor, then pulls an optimus prime and completely transforms into another beast. As the bottle asks, "Is it beer or is it wine?" I think that's the problem it doesn't really ever make up it's mind. It's not bad but it's not really my thing. 
MF: Very active on the tongue like a champaign, very carbonated but I think it's appropriate for this "style". 
D: I think this is where this one suffers,the most, it is too much like a wine, and something that you really have to be in the mood for. Lastly it's a one and done not only because of the style but at $8.99 for 375ml it's pretty pricey. I'm glad I tried it and it'd definitely a different offering from a great brewery but I suppose it's just not my "glass o beer" 1,086 charactersChillMike, Jan 14, 2007
4.02/5  rDev -8.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Undated corked and caged 375 pours a fairly hazy light gold straw color. Looks almost like a wit. One finger head rises and falls quickly, leaving only a ring around the top of the glass.
Aroma is very refreshing. Light fruits, sour apples, over ripe pears, sugar, brett, alcohol, and a touch of wheat. Fairly mild overall.
Flavor is superb. Very mild and restrained brett character, giving only a touch of sourness and funk. Smooth almost wheat beer like flavor, with light fruity yeast esters. All wrapped up in a warm blanket of smooth vanilla flavors. Delicious. Superb as it gets warmer. Mouthfeel is moderate and well carbonated. Drinkability is great.
This is one of the more "approachable" wild ales for beginers I feel. Despite that, it is a great treat for any wild ale lover. Fantastic and well rounded in every way. 836 charactersphisig137, Jan 12, 2007

Appearance was very good, lots of head, not the greatest retention though.
Smell and taste was more complex than anything I have ever had. It begins very fruity, some lemon and grapes, and then the oak and malt flavor sucks all the sweetness away. Very different. I could also note some hints of tar, commonly used in wines.
Mouthfeel and drinkability are good as well. 424 characterssupercolter, Jan 11, 2007
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a long stem, caged and corked bottle, batch #2.
Appearance: Poured slowly into a Duvel tulip, Temptation is golden in color, with a 1" foamy white head that dissipated to a thick lacing topping the beer. Somewhat hazy due to suspended yeast.
Smell: Wow, not sure how to describe this, but let me try. Faintly fruity sweet but has a funky, spicy overriding aroma, maybe hints of black pepper, sweat, apples and white wine and oak, who knows what else.
Taste: Starts with hints of sour green apples, dry white wine possibly pinot gris or sauvigon blanc, oak and an array of spices. The middle is smooth then transitions to a finish that is more sour apples and white wine. Extremely dry in the finish like a very dry wine, makes the mouth beg for more.
Mouthfeel: Plenty of carbonation to make things very lively in the mouth, a medium bordering on thin due to the carbonation and it being a very dry beer.
Drinkability/Notes: My first wild ale and I'm not dissapointed. I love the fact that Vinnie used Brett in this beer. Very unique with hints of sour apples and dry white, oak, wine and pepper. Spicy and funky but also very tasty. Definitely not a session beer but one to drink slowly and savor. What can I say, this one sort of blew me away with a totally different aroma and flavor profile. Not for everyone, but one I will definitely seek again. If you can get this, I highly recommend giving it a try. Highly recommended. 1,455 charactersSwillBilly, Jan 06, 2007
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at RR Brew Co. Batch 002.
The beer poured a pale yellow with a generous white head.
The aroma was bursting with tart lactic acid, fruity esters, and a ton oak - more oak than batch 001
The flavor of the beer was bright and tangy, but at just the right level. A healthy amount of oakiness and vanilla made their way through the sips. The hops were subdued and helped round things out. This beer is very complex and almost champagne-like. This beer had a noticeably higher level of oak than batch 001. I love oak, but to me, batch 001 seemed a little bit more delicate. According to RR, batch 001 was on oak for 12 months, while batch 002 was on oak for 16.
The carbonation was high (correct for the style) and helped at bite to the beer.
Very complex and satisfying. Highly drinkable due to it's dryness. Get it while you can. This beer is a masterpiece. I should've gotten one of those 3L bottles. 919 charactersSacoDeToro, Jan 04, 2007
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is a very exceptional beer from batch #001. I believe it is my first American Wild ale, and one of the best of the style. Many thanks to dogfooddog for sending it.
The beer pours to a clear golden yellow with a thin white head. Retains to about a centimeter throughout the duration of the drink. Lacing is not the greatest. Carbonation is good, as expected.
The aroma is fairly light. A hint of sweet, though primarily oak and chardonnay. Some tartness as well, from the brett.
The taste is very good. A hint of sweetness up front, but it quickly fades into a very dry tartness from the brettanomyces. Huge oak flavor -- probably among the oakiest beers I've ever tried, if not THE most oaked. Also a light hint of chardonnay grapes.
The mouthfeel is light and crisp with a nice tartness. Bone dry, with only a feint hint of residual sweetness. Very enjoyable, and quite drinkable as well. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. I'm very much considering ordering some more of this from the RR website. Thanks again, dogfooddog! 1,042 charactersneonbrown82, Jan 03, 2007
4.17/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Ordered this from the Russian River website. It's batch #2.
Pours a hazy yellow/tan color. At first the head forms quickly, but dissipates to a think layer across the top that stick around, but isn't overwhelming like a Belgian Pale. Looks a little like a weiss with a thin head.
Smell is like a lambic. Sour, but it has an oak scent in the background. A little spice to zing your nostrils, too.
The first taste is sweet, but it becomes more sour and finished with some black-pepper like spice. Yeasty and citrus, but with that same zing at the end. The oak seems to come through more in the smell than the taste, but there's a little there. There's definitely a wine-flavor that seems to encompass everything, but without being overbearing.
While this is a sipper, you'll find your sips come in greater and greater frequency. I really enjoy the pepper hit at the end. Alcohol really doesn't seem to be present at all, which makes it go down easy.
I'm not sure I could afford to make this a session brew, but I certainly would if it were an option. 1,053 charactersDomingo, Dec 25, 2006

Taste is sour, oak, vanilla, pineapples, more sour, spices, very tart acidity, almost salt and vinegar, excellent.

A - Pours a hazy straw yellow with almost no head but a few patches of hazy white lacing.
S - Tart apples, oak, lemons, fruit, funk, hints of chardonnay, sour. Man there is a lot going on here.
T - Sour grapes, tart apples, lemon, fruits, hints of chardonnay. The blonde ale malt backbone is present with the clean funky/sour flavors mixed in. Complex and leaving me taking sip after sip to try to find all the flavors.
M - Well carbonated and crisp. It mentions that his batch was over carbonated and the cork was removed and recorked to degas. I think the degassing did the trick as the carbonation now plays well with the tart sourness.
D - Hats off to Vinnie on another fine beer. I wish great beers like this were more readily available and in 750's as my 375ml went too fast. 806 charactersbrewcrew76, Dec 19, 2006

Slightly cloudy, light gold color. Minimal head, which doesnt last long. Looks (and behaves) like a glass of Martinellis cider. Scant lacing.
Smells of Martinellis, too. Lots of crisp apple scent, which is very pleasant. Not much else.
Would be hard pressed to identify this as beer. Tastes like a sour apple cider, with little depth. Tart apple, hints of sour cherry, and a touch of grapey Chardonnay flavors. Raw flavors. Unimpressive.
Very carbonated, (unpleasantly fizzy,) with an acidic finish. Clean texture, but a little difficult to get down.
Clearly, this isn't my style. Not one I'll be sipping again. 777 charactersMVassar, Dec 18, 2006

Appears a hazy, pale gold with a fluffy white cap that slowly fades out. Scattered spots of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is of citrusy, funk, oak, vanilla, brett, and mild sugar.
Taste is of the same aromas in a wonderfully done brew. The flavors jump along the palate with glee. Highlights include the light funk mixed with wine, vanilla, and some sugary caramel. This is hardcore and it outdoes some of the counterparts overseas.
Mouthfeel is of a spritzy, nicely carbonated yet restrained brew that is smooth but bouncey with the CO2 giving rise to the vanilla esters riding along the sugary, chardonnay grapes.
Vinnie is an excellent brewer. He is at the top of the charts for American brewers IMHO. With the wine background, he has the experience to make this stuff work. This is no exception to the rule. Well done. 903 charactersweeare138, Dec 14, 2006

Thanks Westsidethreat for this wonderful beer.
Appearance: 375ml corked bottle. Pours a honeyish orange in my Piraat snifter. Starts with a one finger white head that fades quickly and forms a nice layer on top.
Smell: Starts with an initial smell of tart, musty, barrel aged greatness. The oak and chardonnay notes come through near the finish. This smells fu*king amazing.
Taste: Damn...The taste follows the wonderful aromas. Starts out tart and dry. The finish is oak, vanilla, tropical fruits and spices followed by a very nice dryness.
Mouthfeel: Nice and spritzy mouthfeel. The sourness and oakey notes hang around for a bit. 
Drinkability: I could drink this all day any day. Even though it's quite tart, it goes down quite smooth. Very drinkable.
Lots of time when beers are hyped up, they become a let down. Not in this case. This is the first offering from RR that I have tried. If this is any indication of their other offerings, then I can see why the awards keep piling up in Santa Rosa. If you see this and don't buy it....shame on you. I just wished they shipped to MI. If they did, I'd be celebrating Christmas and New Year with the 3 litre badboy. 1,268 charactersnorthernbrews, Dec 09, 2006

Smells are faint but pleasant, I noticed a slight toasted and tart note, but the aromas are subtle.
Taste is extremely interesting. Tastes very toasty, biscuit like, and a bit sour. This beer has a very "champagne" like quality, but with less carbonation than a glass of champagne. Very enjoyable beer to try... not much "beer like" that I can compare it too.
Mouthfeel on this one is wonderful. Very full and round, really coasts your mouth nicely..
This is an excellent "beer". Very interesting... a must try! 594 charactersflexabull, Dec 04, 2006

Sparkling flamed gold. Short head of fine, bright white bubbles that wilts to a dusting and a tall collar. Fine drapes of lace cling to the glass. Central spire of steady, small bubbled streams. Sweet, slightly brett laced aroma melded with some woodiness and white grapes. Brett funk and a lemon zest edge lead into a sweet and dry white wine-laced middle. Bright and fruity with moderate dryness, the finish has an ample amount of funk, but it does not linger long. The back corners of the mouth instead are grabbed by a refreshing crispness. There is a fair amount of sweetness beneath the surface. Medium body with a firm, slightly dry mouthfeel and fine bubbled carbonation. Nice overall and definitely drinkable. 759 charactershopsaplenty, Nov 13, 2006
4.1/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5pours with very active white head taking up over half the glass... nose is quickly very musty, acidic, strong hints of lambic-type sourness as well as an odor I almost always find in old, decayed bottled beer. The bad odor passes quickly (gas?) and the beer now smells much more like a typical geueze.
tasting it is like tasting a geueze where you expect a big bite, but only get a medium-sized one. The sourness is present but not overwhelming, I cannot pick up any distinct wood notes different from what I normal get from lambics despite use of an unusual wood from chardonnay. Perhaps some of the winey acidic taste comes.
Interesting american effort at something very close to a lambic. Wonder if they have more aging more than a year in barrel. Very refreshing, not overpowering, and overall well worth seeking out. 827 charactersdogfooddog, Nov 08, 2006

Smell: Butterscotch, butter, wild yeast, and musty, oaky grapes predominate the smell. Light citrus, honey, apple, and vague spiciness present. General pleasant earthy, sour smell also. Very complex smell.
Taste: WOW. Very vinous in nature. Light caramel apple maltiness on the intial that progresses into a sweet and sour grape taste with a pleasant oaked taste. The wild yeast is definitely present but blends nicely with the overall taste. Smooth buttery taste with a light citrus hops. It really tastes as smells, but better. It is really the best of beer meets the best of chardonnay. Flavors and smell improved as it approached room temperature.
Medium bodied, very low carbonation. Excellent mouthfeel with nice transitions. Moderately slick and smooth on the initial becoming dryer then a brief fruity sweetness and great dry white wine finish. Alcohol presence is well balanced. 
I could easily drink several glasses of this. Easy to drink. Sessionable, but I would want to drink it slowly to savour it. I'll take more of this anyday! 1,171 characterslaintringulis, Nov 07, 2006

S- The white wine smell comes through. Also some light woody (oak) smells. Some weird kind of fruit and spices. Hops also make their way through. It is almost like the style desribes a "wild" smell.
T- Some big white wine flavors. I think this might be one of first where it is just aged in oak (not with oak chips in it) that I can actually taste the oak. Some light grapes with that drying finish to them. The alcohol warming also comes through. Maybe some piney and earthy hops in there. The malt does help balance it all out but does take a big back seat. It is mostly just a strong wine flavor. Truly different than any beer I have tasted. Also is on the sour side. Maybe spiced a bit too. Its a very complex brew.
M- medium to full body. Low carbonation. Nice big dry finish. 
D- I am surprised how much I like this for something tasting so much like a white wine. It is very complex and I love that in a beer. It is strangely appealing. From what I have tried so far a truly unique beer. I think this one is worth the money. 1,120 charactersBlindPig, Oct 23, 2006

This beer has a sour aroma. Some spicy aroma is present. It smells citrusy also. Orange, and a touch of lemon. That pretty much dominates the aroma.
This beer tastes much like it smells. Mostly citrusy, with orange and lemon dominating. I think I taste just a touch of alcohol. It has a yeasty flavor also. It tastes quite sour, in a pleasent way.
This beer is quite refreshing. It is smooth. It leaves a sour aftertaste. It has less carbonation than I expected.
I dont think this beer would make a great session beer. It is a little too sour to be able to drink too many. It would become cloying. However one or two is great.
Overall: This beer is great. I think I will go back and buy more. 817 charactersOStrungT, Oct 15, 2006
4.15/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a corked and caged 375ml bottle into a tulip glass. Can't find a date printed on the label, but it does say 'Store in a cool, dark place. Batch 001." I looked up this batch on the web site and it is the only batch of this beer. It also says that aging is required to let the wine flavors mellow, as it was aged in Chardonnay barrels.
Appearance - Pours with a creamy white two-finger head that leaves excellent lacing as it goes down. It dissipates after a short time to a constant cap of very thick and creamy white head. The beer is a pale honey color that is very clear. There is a lot of carbonation activitiy from within.
Smell - Are we sure this isn't a gueuze? Just kidding, but it does smell a lot like the Boon Geuze I just had. Champagne like on the nose, with hints of slightly sour/bitter hops behind this. The malt character smells totally separate from the rest, but is rich in aroma. Some peppery spiciness is also there, perhaps from the alcohol.
Taste - Sour champagne flavors up front, with hints of apple and pear. Very slight bitterness from the hops. Again there is a peppery spiciness, and some oak/musty character. The malt again tastes "separate" and is rich and buscuity, but definitely a background flavor. The finish is quick, with a burst of more winey sourness. The aftertaste has some hints of the malt, and just a touch of sourness. Little alcohol can be detected.
Mouthfeel - The carbonation does carry an initial bite, but mellows into a pleasant level. The is light-bodied and not very smooth. It actually has a very "thin" feeling in the mouth.
Drinkability - I personally don't care too much for that winey sourness in this beer, but it wasn't bad. The beer had a lot else to offer to make up for it, like its very subtle complexities, for one. Still, this sourness takes from its drinkability a bit, in my opinion.
My first beer of this style, and not too bad. The flavors were strong and pronounced, and it was pretty well-balanced for all of the flavors it had. The nearest comparable beer I've had is a gueuze and this exceeds any of those I have sampled. Recommended. 2,138 charactersdblinkhorn, Oct 04, 2006
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Drinking this beer is a remarkable experience! I practically left this world for a while, becoming totally engrossed in the entire encompassing experience that is "Temptation." We are all susceptible to temptation; it lures us in and is so pleasurable that right and wrong, and all we know and understand is irrelevant because we are engulfed by the experience. That is the case with this beer, aptly named, "Temptation." I was in a full room with a large group of friends, but as I enjoyed this beer I left all that behind (for a time).
Presentation: A true collectable bottle that is beautiful and classy. Corked and caged, the bottle is marked Batch 001. The server at Monk's removes the cage and then it pops like champagne and poured into a Duchesse De Bourgogne goblet.
Appearance: It pours a glimmering golden color. The head fades to a majestic halo around the beer clearly indicating it rightful status as nobility among beer.
Smell: She brought the beer out while I was still eating. I wanted to get the most from the beer so I finished eating first. However for 10 minutes while I finished eating the aroma was lofting from the glass and teasing my senses. From the moment she popped the cork I could smell the French oak aroma. The smell is unique but the closest thing I've had recently was Cidre Bouché Brut De Normandie 2004, a French oak aged cider. The aromas of wood and leather are complimented with honey vanilla and yeast that are in a league of their own. Simply stated; enticing!!
Taste: Beautiful apple oak, green and white grapes, Chardonnay or rather Pinot Grigio flavors parallel the sweet vanilla honey French oak, earthy flavors. A bit of vinous (wine like) alcohol with some wild Brett tartness and a sour apple snap in the finish keep everything about the beer lively and exciting while equally balanced and meloncaly. There is not one iota of conflict amongst the blended flavors of this true masterpiece!
Mouthfeel: The beer is full bodied and both slick & smooth and creamy & sprtizy. That sour tangy Brett flavor pulls and puckers the palate then lasts long after it's gone. So what does it really feel like? It feels like it is messing with my mind and I love it.
Drinkability: Everything beautiful and wonderful about creativity and the world brewing is exemplified in this beer. Belgium has Westvleteren 12 and they can boast; but guess what... America has Temptation from Russian River Brewing Company!!!
Hope this is helpful.
Cheers! 2,496 charactersPhatz, Oct 02, 2006
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I began salivating in anticipation before I ever even popped the cork on this one. And thus begins the seduction. Batch 001.
One Russian River 12.7 ounce olive-colored, caged and corked glass bottle paired with a long-stemmed over-sized wine glass.
Straw yellow and light shiny copper with pulp-free not-from-concentrate orange juice might begin to describe the color of this beer. Tiny but active CO2 bubbles dance about the interior. A solid 4.5 caliber white head translates into beautifully sticky glass lace art when swirled.
In my nose: Super-sexy Brett funk snuggles up with sweet and clean Belgian blonde and woody French wine. The actions of wild yeast have contributed complex fruity flavors redolent of late season apples but the French oak character and chardonnay notes predominate.
Wine-like and dry with sour Brett pucker, this fancy-pants beer is one fine mother--wait a minute, this isn't Dr. Seuss. Sorry.
I find this beer, while maintaining a remarkable depth of character, doesn't exhibit a terribly large breadth of flavors.
By no means is this bad, it is only to say,
The flavors you get are the ones that you may...
Have expected to get all along, don't you see? 
It is flavors of oak and of wine that hit me.
Of oak and of wine and of apples Brett soured. And I also found out that it's alcohol powered and I've drunk the whole thing in just under one hour.
My cheeks have flushed red and I long for my bed. But who will end this review my wife said? To her I replied all sad and red-eyed...
That it might be reported, or might be deleted but I just do not have the words to complete it. What to do? What to say? Well I think that it's time. To end this review and to end this bad rhyme. Not enough has been said about this great beer, so back to the topic this train wreck I steer.
Umm...
What I meant to say was that this beer is made up of a fairly simple battery of flavors that carry a complexity in their own right. The barrel aging and the Brettanomyces bring to life a beer that was most likely a phenomenon on its own.
I don't know if I can salvage a respectable review at this point, so I'll close quickly. Russian River has another platinum beer here. Thanks to Vinnie and Co. for conceiving and caring for this beer. And thanks are due to RedwoodGeorge, my supplier of upper crust West Coast ales. 2,372 charactersfroggyfrog, Sep 23, 2006

The golden color fizzed nicely in my Chimay chalice. It swirled a nice pinky finger head. A sweet and sour Brettanomyces fragrance reminded me of an oud bruin, almost. The taste was tart without being cloying, as a sweetness followed. Sour apple and meringue flavors were evident. It's close in taste to Depuration, but a bit sweeter. A fine beer. 452 characterssloejams, Sep 22, 2006

Aroma is belgium in yeasts....sweet, sweet malts...and earthy...somthing very green, natural, and very earthy.
Taste is very sour...a little medicinal in the swallow....sweet citrus fruits with citrus peel bitterness....a little lemon on the tailend
It leaves your mouth clean, fresh and dry, surprisingly.

An interesting beer, I am still experimenting with the sour beers and am still unsure how much i enjoy them, but I'll keep trying every so often.

Golden color with a creamy white head that leaves a coating of lacing on the glass. Smell is very fruity and tart. I pick up some oak notes as well . Taste hits you with the tartness up front but then mellows to a smooth sweetness. Reminds me of a chardonay and even has the buttery note to the finish. Oak and vanilla flavors become more prominent as it warms. Overall a very good brew. I love the effort that went into this brew and wish I had a bunch more to drink. I will buy every Russian River that I can get my hands on. 556 charactersbeermanbrian, Sep 06, 2006

A: Pours a highly carbonated golden color. A huge white head that will last as long as you drink it. Sticks to the glass as you drink it. Very nice.
S: Carbonation comes first. Tickles the nose, then come citrus tones with a tartness. Hints of oak, but subtle. The brett/gueze smell is definitely there though. Lovely.
T: Wow. Another great beer from Vinnie of Russian River. Tartness and carbonation comes first. The oak/chardonnay comes next. Hints of fruit. I have come to love sour beers and this is another fine example why.
I actually had beatification before this. A lot of similarities between the two. I actually preferred the beatification, but as no denigration to this beer. Temptation is amazing and worth every penny. 791 charactersCallenak, Aug 07, 2006

Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a touch of orange. Has a creamy white had that thins. Thick lacing on the glass.
Aroma is tart, fruity, and very similar to wine. I also detect a touch of oak and just the slightest bit of malt.
Quite tart upfront with a slight hint of the base golden ale. Lots of fruity tones enriched by a nice oak flavor. I also detect some light vanilla notes, which have appeared more as it warms. Finishes quite tart with a slight acidic citrusy bite.
Light body, creamy texture. Plenty of carbonation.
What an unusual and tasty ale, and very easy to drink. I wish I had another. 690 charactersMaltyGoodness, Aug 05, 2006
4.15/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4"Batch 1" according to the bottle.
Poured into a tulip glass, a hazy golden color with a thin, creamy white head that settled to lace and left a thick film clinging to the sides of the glass
The scent was dominated by a tart rhubarb kind of smell mixed with malt. It somewhat reminded me of RR's Supplication, although it's been so long since I tried the Supp that I can't say which scent I prefer. Nonetheless, tempting, hence the name.
First sip: oh, it burns! Still tart, somewhere between rhubarb and cherry. The alcohol is highly prevalent, which is completely appropriate in this case. A wicked bite but with a clean finish (thanks alyankus for the Terminology 101). This is what I look for in a beer: each sip kicks my palate's ass, fades away, and makes me beg for another. Brutal mouthfeel, yet highly drinkable. A paradox in a bottle.
Further into the glass, I picked up on another strange flavor: a cooling, sort of wintogreen minty taste. This flavor was very subtle and neither enhanced nor interfered with the overall experience.
Temptation is very similar to the Supplication as I recall, and I can't complain. I'll have to try them both head-to-head to really understand the distinction. Hopefully they'll both be available at RRBC when I make a trip up there in about a month. Woo hoo! 1,317 charactersinstrumentality, Jul 28, 2006

dry white wine and white grapes in the flavor as it starts, then finishes dry with an edge of tartness. funky and sour, but very subtly so. fairly light mouthfeel and a fizzy, champagne-like carbonation. light and complex, but comes off as too weak, especially for someone who loves gueuze. 540 charactersPrufrock, Jul 24, 2006

S: Wet hay, yeast, pungent oak, lemon peel and coriander.
T: whooooweeee thats sour. Citric acid attacks the tip and front of the tongue with reckless abandon. From there notes of kiwi, grapefruit and caramel apples start to take form. These flavors merge with the abundant oak flavors and meld completely until only that classic Russian River brett is shining. This fades and a precise lemon sourness prevails at the roof of the mouth. Aftertaste of lemon peel and bittering hops.
M: Medium body with a frizzy carbonation.
D: They call it a blonde. Yeah, a Russian River blonde! Everyone other brewery in the world would call this a sour. 822 charactersWestsidethreat, Jul 21, 2006
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It pours a slightly hazy and well-carbonated straw gold. Two fingers of bright white head last and quilt the surface. Scoops of lacing dollop the inside of the glasss. 
As the aroma wafts, a creamy, muted grain sweetness trios with cherry and dark berry, and a tart sour apple note shines through. A lighter spiciness works with the alcohol and a cidery tang.
Upon tasting, there swims a sweet and sour malt and fruit concoction, with light grain, green apple, and blackberry. A mouth-filling oaken vinous character nods to a swirl of alcohol, and a slick of vanilla carries a mellow spice bitterness to counter a lingering sourness. Residual yeast tartness holds sway in a very mellow finish. The earthy flavor is a fine mate for the funky Brett. 
Medium bodied, the puckering sourness and lively carbonation make this a sly entity on the palate. 
It's an intriguing amalgam of farmland funky and aristocratic wine country. It's unique and a stretch, but damned if it doesn't work. Sure, the ABV is a hoot, but in such a happy way, and with the tartness in play it's refreshing and drinkable. This is why thinking outside the box can be a real good thing. 1,168 charactersFoxman, Jul 06, 2006

Aroma is soft fruits peachs, berries, strawberries, light pink grapefruit along with some nice dry oak aromas on a light malt backdrop.
Taste is a nice fruity mix good zesty flavors good dry oak crispness. Some good brett flavors but not as intense as the Supplication on the wild side anyway. Temptation is softer can taste the golden ale underneath everything going on. This would be the one to try for those who don't like super sour, man this is a master piece of work.
Mouthfeel is nice smooth lightly carbonated. Almost medium after the last bit added to the glass almost seem lightly gritty in texture.
Drinkability is great only hampered by cost this is one fine brew of many Vinnie has going. Glad I have another. From batch 001. 850 charactersmntlover, Jul 04, 2006
4.63/5  rDev +5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 001. Top notch presentation in a 12.7 ounce glass. Very unique bottle with a fantastic label. Cork and caged.
Pours a brilliant straw into long stem white wine glass. Carbonation is wildly disturbed by the shape of the glass causing a tidal clash of yeasty white head. The mountain of cream constantly dissolves and reforms each time I pick up the glass. This is a fun beer to play with. Carbonation streaming is flawless. I feel compelled to say that this is a perfect looking brew, a true 5.
Nose is a ballyhoo of citric zest but through that intensity spouts a surge of oak and then a second surge of vanilla. After a while this pandemonium blends into a nice cohesive chardonnay but thats not all. Above the lemons and oak barrel aromas there is something much more importantDa Funk! That quality that one finds in a great lambicyep, its here. 
Taste/Mouthfeel: An initial blast of sour grapes is quite fun but a bit overpowering. Seconds later, however, the palate is well adjusted and the Chardonnay like subtleties become palpable. The ever-present sourness is my favorite aspect of the beer but it does not outshine all else, as is the case in some lambics. Within the sour frame and coalescing with vanilla flavors lies a buttery mouthfeel. Its surprising and eminently pleasurable. Herein too we find a miscellany of citrus, pear, apricot, rotten hay, and white grape skins, all of which combines to form that wonderful funk that we all so enjoy. 
Ingurgitate - To swallow greedily or in excessive amounts; gulp. Yep, thats this beer to a T-funk. If I may add a new adjective to my beer reviewing vocabulary, this one is inguritatable. 1,675 charactersDaPeculierDane, Jun 05, 2006

big thanks to goodbyeohio for this brew (batch 001)
A- This beer has a hazy golden deep copper color with a thick pure white foam that last and last. The carbonation is wave of microbubbles swirling in the glass. The head turns into thick sheets that stick to the side of the glass after each sip and turn to lace in some parts. 
S- The smell of tart wild yeast and wild mushroom has a very soft hint of light oak and fresh rain with a very light earthy decomposition note. The finish has a nice bright lemon zest note. 
T- The taste of smooth slightly sweet pale malt has a faint tartness with a brightness almost like lemon to it. There is a very light oak taste that is smooth and really balances the sweet malt and tartness. On the exhale, after each sip there is a very faint ham note that is quite nice. As it warms notes of chardonnay start to come through nicely and a faint grapefruit note blends with it. 
M- This beer has a medium-light mouthfeel with a nice pucker in the back of the jaws in the finish. 
D- Wow. This beer is so complex and smooth yet too mysterious to describe it in words. The flavors of Bret and oak are soft enough to let the blonde ale shine through but strong enough to give it so much more depth and character. I was expecting a sharp "extreme" American punch in the mouth but instead I got a beer that taste like decades of craftsmanship in the making. 1,428 charactersrhoadsrage, Jun 05, 2006
4.1/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 001 on the bottle. Had at Monks in Philly.
Poured and hazy yellow gold. Head was large with white, small bubbles. Very carbonated. Smell was black pepper and fruity with yeast and dust in the background. Taste follows suit. Not as tart as most Flanders Reds, but tart none the less. The tartness is just one of the flavor characters that separates this one. As it warms it changes dramatically. Sometimes I tasted tart, sometimes white wine, apricot, black pepper It just kept changing. 
I wonder what a longer tasting session would have yielded. Aftertaste is very mild compared to the flavor and the light body leaves you wanting more. Very drinkable and interesting. 685 characterssacfly, May 29, 2006

Smoky from a year in chardonnay barrels and slightly soured from an addition of Brettanomyces yeast.

4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Hazy golden straw colour with a fluffy, bright white head. Constant streams of bubbles supported the cap of foam, which left clumpy lacing behind once it started to subside. The brett aroma was apparent across the table. White wine and grape notes as well, with some earthy woodiness. Citrusy sweetness with some acidity, similar to sweet tarts, hits up front. A more substantial, almost syrupy, sweetness follows. Solid bitterness with floral hops and a bit of spice in the finish. A bit of barnyard funk as well. The sweet tart character melds with a bit of oak in the lingering finish. Light dryness, medium bodied, with effervescent carbonation. This beer has plenty of character and goes down very easy. Thoroughly enjoyable.
Notes from 12/16/2006 (Batch 002): This beer produces tons of lacing. The aroma was a little funkier than before - some horseblanket, a little salty with some vinegar (almost like salt & vinegar chips) - but strangely appealing. Citrus flavour was more lemony and there was a little spicy alcohol character as well. Very dry. Again, a beer that I enjoyed quite a lot. I'm tempted to give it a "5" for Taste, but it just wasn't quite there. Maybe next time I try it. 1,199 charactersDrJay, May 19, 2006

Aroma is a swirling fruity-yeasty wonderland. Spice is very apparent, mixed in with grapefruit and strong banana.
Pungent fruit and spice hit up front. Very champagne like, tangy on the end. nice bit of yeastiness throughout.
Very wet feel, with a rough yet tight carbonation up top. Very nice.
VERY drinkable. complex, but not too assertive. Good session beer- but also good for an after-diner drink. Well done!

Loose sheets of lace cling to the glass. Brett aroma, heavy on the cheese, very much like sharp swiss cheese, somewhat farmy, with pale malt. Tart and fruity, big on the wildberry and grape. The flavor starts sweet and cheesy, immediately evoking swiss or mild bleu cheese, modest pale malt sweetness. Farmy and wild, flowery, with a pronounced brett quality throughout. Sour white grape and apricot. A touch of vanilla oakiness, mostly in the end. Finishes moderately sour, vivid wild grape, very dry and tart. Charged, blooming carbonation, lighter bodied, with a fluffy mouthfeel. Sharp swiss cheese aftertaste. Awesome.
Sessionable wild ale? Hell yes. Incredibly good. I'll jump on the chance of having this again. Please ditribute to CT...or MA. 861 charactersUnionMade, Apr 21, 2006

Pours a clear sparkling peach color with a one finger white head that never goes away and leaves tons of lacing. The aroma is of fruit, white wine, and cobwebby mustiness. Intriguing.
The first taste just blows me away. A sharp tart character is followed by peachy fruitiness and a bunch of sweet, lightly toasted grain. Wow, what a combination. The finish is pretty dry and lingers forever with an oakiness and some malt. This is so incredibly balanced that none of the flavors win out over the others and the combination of them is really something special. This is what I was hoping Supplication was going to be.
The mouthfeel is perfect - just carbonated enough to be really smooth on the tongue, which really works to make the sourness less biting and more inviting. Drinkability is very high. I will definitely be tracking down more Temptation. 870 charactersPatYoda, Apr 18, 2006

Pours a straw golden in color, slightly cloudy with a robusy creamy head with excellent retention. Nose is markedly earthy, quite Belgian-like as one might expect. There are elements that remind of an aged cheddar cheese or the like as well, notes of wine as well. Taste is decidedly like a Belgian pale with a certain woody-earthiness which I would imagine is derived from the barrel aging process. Slightly sour, but still approachable, very well balanced and instantly likable. I enjoyed this one immensely.

4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer poured a light golden apple juice color that was slightly foggy with a thin egg shell head sustained by sparse, slow moving bubbles. 
Smelled of oak, sour cherries and turned milk, (Bretts doing, I presume) with a backing of honey and golden raisins with a slight biscuit doughiness. 
Tasted of a light and sweet apple and pineapple base that slowly picked up some grapefruit rind and then faded into a smooth, terribly under ripe fruit, a bit of woody oak and sour milk. The journey of this beer was stupendous that was made all the better by the coupling of the smell with the flavor. 
The mouth feel was light, but the carbonation actually detracted from the flavor. 
This is an extremely enjoyable sipper that takes your sense for a ride. Again, the compliments of the smells and flavors really was spectacular and the dynamics of the flavor were top notch. 885 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Apr 11, 2006

very tart and a little funky smelling (the good funky). apples and white wine with some oak. lemony citrus.
the taste has a lot more complexity to it than the smell. the sour aromas cover up many of the more subtle aromas. tart and white wine like, with apples, white grapes, lemon, there's more fruit in the but it's hard to identify. oak and a little vanilla towards the finish with bourbon at the very end and aftertaste. it makes me wanna smack my lips. oh yeah, it's got a little funk too, it gets up in the sinuses.
medium-ish body with a wild sort of carbonation. nice and dry.

The frothy white head stood tall in the glass. Lacing remained in the glass as the beer was drained. Much of the aroma had fruit notes like pear, orange, and lemon, but there were also earthy undertones and whiff of sea air. The first taste was tangy on the tongue, but was accompanied with a mild bitterness and a hint of tannin as I continued. Temptation was light in body and highly carbonated, almost spritzy.
I must thank my brother for bringing this to me. This was my first Russian River beer, and I am impressed. I want to go to Santa Rosa and live at the brewery, if only for a day or two! Thankfully, I've still got 3 other RR beers to try. Bravo! 769 charactersfrazbri, Apr 05, 2006

Aroma of oaky chardonnay and green apples, with all the complexity that can add. Now that I've learned what Brett smells like it seems very prevalent.
Flavors of sweet white grapes, some deeply oaked and flinty chardonnay along with some tart green apples are prevalent. Incredibly complex and beautifully emerged.
Mouthfeel is fully carbonated but relative light on the palate. Overall the beer glides effervescently down and seems to cover all of the different aspects of taste. Sweet, sour, salty, light bittering, spice . . . finishes with a decent tart kick.
Drinkability is amazing, wine lovers beer for sure but this one is just incredible. Not my favorite style but this one is so unique and delectable to almost be a work of art. Kudos to Vinnie.

Smell wine like with lemon and fruity scents much like a Chardonnay. There is a strong whiskey aroma to this. Vanilla and caramel from the oak barrels used most likely. Fairly sweet smell after your nose adapts a bit, but I can't say that it has a malty smell. Fairly spicy scent mostly black pepper.
Taste is fairly sour at the beginning but nowhere near lambic funk. The sweet and sour yin and yang here is somewhat like a Flanders Red. After three sips your taste buds adapt and the other flavors come out. Lime and oak mix with the caramel and vanilla flavors that comes out as some new wacky Mojito variant in your mouth.
Mouthfeel is good.
I have a hard time here deciding if I really like this or not. I hate sour beers as a rule but this isn't a jaw locking Lambic. Really interesting vanilla and caramel here that makes me think of a bourbon barrel beer. I guess I have to say that this isn't my first choice of the Russian River Beers. 1,145 charactersZorro, Mar 26, 2006

Nose is loads of brett, lemons, grassy, tart grapes and whiffs of oak. Starts tart, and fluctuates with estery bananas, lemons, more tart grapes, hay, and fading into oak. Mouthfeel is light and feathery. Not poundable, but that's not an issue here. Incredible. 325 charactersnumenor1, Feb 28, 2006
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Absolutely brilliant! The oak is massive and the Brett is somewhat restrained. It's drier than might be expected. Poured carefully from a long-standing bottle it delivers a clear (I can see my fingerprints through the glass) dark gold body beneath a creamy head of white. The head retention is superb, and it leaves a solid wall of foam around the inside of the glass. The nose is bright with Brettanomyces (mineralish, leathery, acidic, musty, barnyard, "horseblanket") , tempered by oak, and sparked with a spritz of lemon. In the mouth it's very fine-bubbled, natural carbonation caresses the tongue with a delicate bristle. Medium bodied. The flavor is as the aroma suggests with a firm bitterness for support and a little more acidity. The label suggests that it picks up wine flavors from the oak barrels and I think that's true, there's a definite white grape flavor there. There are some other fruits in there as well, maybe some apricot; some mildly tart tangerine; a drop of pineapple; and even some grapefruit as well. It finishes with a flick of acidity that receeds to leave a citrus-rind bitterness behind. Remarkably refined and easy to drink for the style. 1,172 charactersNeroFiddled, Feb 17, 2006
4.38/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep golden with shades of amber. Carbonation rises slowly through the hazed body. The snow white head has great retention and lace ability. Aroma is lemony, a little acidic, orangey, biscuity and funky. Lemon tones hit me first upon sipping. Other citric fruits are present as well. And some funkiness. A little sourness, but it's quite reserved in this one. Oak and wine of course. And a thirst quenching dryness. Carbonation is gentle yet noticeable. Light body. This one grows on you. 
Thanks yet again to TheLongBeachDweller for yet another stellar ale from Russian River. 580 charactersBighuge, Feb 14, 2006

I had about an once and a half of this at a beer tasting and thought it was amazing. I just had to have a full bottle for myself...
Hazy apricot in color. Quick disappearing white head. Only a small pool of bubbles sits on top. Aroma is tart apples and some white grapes. Again the tart apples and white grapes come through in the taste. Some hints of light oak work their way in. Smells much tarter than it actually is. Has some initial tartness on the tongue and a touch of spices. Very similar to a wine. Super clean palate on this one, nothing which seems 'off-flavored'.
Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but to style. Carbonation is evident. Finishes very dry. Super drinkable. A nicely constructed flavor that isn't overbearing. 767 charactersblitz134, Feb 09, 2006

 Taste is incredible. Lemon cake, Brett, something sweet, barnyard character, must, oaky Chardonnay, this is ridiculous. Mouthfeel has Champagne style bubbles. Drinkability is limited by absolutely nothing. 418 charactersSephiroth, Feb 07, 2006

Thick ring of lacing at the top of the glass, and spotty underneath. Tart, vinous aroma of chardonnay. Wine-like flavor, fruity and tannic. Oak is present, and there is some yeast in the background. The finish is zesty with tart fruit and a hint of sweetness. A unique beer to say the least, with some elements of a Lambic or Flemish Sour, yet still different enough to stand out. Refreshing and easy to drink too. Pretty good all around. 557 charactersDogbrick, Feb 06, 2006
3.83/5  rDev -13.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to cmaruschak for the chance to sample this one. 
Appearance: A cloudy straw colored pour emerges from the bottle. Visible carbonation noted throughout the body and terminates in the bone white head.
Smell: Oak, yeast, and cider apples. Very light and tart on the nose.
Taste: Chardonnay grapes, oak, a brush of alcohol, and some metallic sourness that normally would be off-putting but can only assume this comes from the Brett yeast strain. Interesting but I can see how this would fatigue the palate.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with lively carbonation. 
Drinkability: A little too much chardonnay wine like for me. Doesn't really scratch the beer itch at all. However, it's a very unique twist on a blonde ale. Nicely done. 746 charactersmattcrill, Feb 05, 2006

Updated and upgraded, particulalry with improved aromas! on-tap 4.5 years later at the brewpub. Lemony chardonnay, with brett, is very enjoyable and unique. Natural carbonation. 492 charactersSammy, Jan 29, 2006

Lightly hazed yellow amber pour with a massive, dense, rocky-topped head of whipped froth that just stays forever, eventually falling to a 1/4 inch cap that remains. Lace is sticky and artfully applied.
Aroma is crisp golden fruits, pears and white grapes, tart wine, toasty oak, and tart funk that is similar to nearly fermented rotting apples laying in the dirt.
Flavor is complex and intriguing, bringing on notes of green apple, grapes, toasty vanilla oak, wine, and blanketed by sweet/tart rotting fruit and stinging Brett prickles. Funky and unique.
Body is medium, with a light airey texture and soft, mineral-laden mouthfeel. Irresistably sippable. 713 charactersAlexJ, Jan 20, 2006

Pours a cloudy blonde/gold with a rocky, one finger head of white foam. Carbonation looks medium. The head falls to islands and a ring, with minimal lacing. 
Aroma is wonderful Belgian barnyard funk, spicy, sour, with notes of black pepper and other great spices. Hop character is very low. A light fruitiness lies just below the surface. Nice and complex smell.
Flavor is barnyard, sour, fruity, spicy, and really awesome. Hop character is very low, Aftertaste is sour and crisp. I am starting to love this Belgian funk WAY too much. I can't get enough.
Mouthfeel is clean and dry, with a tongue-tingling crispness. Carbonation is medium, adding to the feel. Finish is a long dry crispness.
This reminds me sort of like a saison, with wonderful spicy funkiness. This has to have Brett in it somewhere. Clean and dry, complex as hell; a great addition to RR's portfolio. 959 charactersjakester, Jan 15, 2006

This can be a beer where you can convert not the light beer drinker, but rather the white wine drinker. It seemed like I was drinking a nice balanced beer followed by a chardonnay, hence the BA notes on its aging process. can't compare it to other sof this style but will continue to search for other Wild Ales. Wish I could get my hand on more Russian River brews, I just got lucky the other night. 523 charactersBacker2004, Jan 12, 2006
4.77/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Bottle (batch 1 drank in 2006): Poured a hazy/cloudy dirty yellow color ale with rather large white bubbly head with medium retention. Nose of farmhouse, chardonnay with a sourness resembling lambic. Taste is totally incredible with huge amount of farmhouse (there is probably a better word for this but it is the only I can think of right now), sour notes resembling a lambic and Brett, which is reminiscent of Orval. The Chardonnay barrel effect is maybe a bit too accentuated but still very interesting. Also, it might be a bit too acidic for my liking but it is still very much enjoyable. A more balance level of acid and this would have been a perfect score. Now, I just need to get my hand on some more of this. 717 charactersPhyl21ca, Jan 09, 2006

The aroma gives a swift kick of sourness with a little alcohol and fruit. Sourness dominates the aroma. The flavor is much less sour than the aroma would allow you to think. Actually, there isn't a ton of flavor in this one. At the beginning there is a small bit of fruitiness and some sour notes along with a large kick of wood, but the flavor quickly disappears. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is good, but I'd like to see some more substantial flavors. 568 charactersclvand0, Jan 06, 2006
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a sparse coat over top. Small bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Nose is a beauty. Its sour and tart, but with an awesome almost candy sweetness and some nice oak character playing in the background. Very nice, but I would like to see more flavor overall. Flavor is only lightly sour, with the candied sweetness coming through dominant, but fading to a very neutral finish. Very clean and unobtrusive. Finish is a bit dry. The wood character plays thoughout the flavor as well. Feel is right at moderate with a light carbonation. Alcohol only lets iselfe be known in a light feeling of heat in my ears, as alcohol tends to do to me. Otherwise, this beer really has no flaws. The flavor needs a bit more oomph for me. I'm glad to have another one of these, as I do enjoy it.
Still my first one, just getting new profiles towards the end. I'm getting a lot more oak hanging on into the finish. I'm more happy with the flavor now.
Edit. I didn't want to add a new review since I had my second bottle so close to the first, but the second one was a much different beast. The sour wild character and light oaky and mild grape character were really more prevalent in the second go. I absolutely loved the flavor, so bump this to a full 5. Just everything about the beer seemd to be dialed in better. It danced perfectly on my tongue, not at all light but not heavy either. Right in line. I will have to get one more of these for a re-review in the future. 1,502 characterskmpitz2, Jan 04, 2006
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought two bottles of temptation batch 001 at the RR brewery in Nov 2005. Looks just like the pic above
Opened one up for New Years eve.
Appearance is nice. The golden ale appearance ,almost brass, is not subtle. There is a 3 finger head recieved from pouring into the RR glass I bought at the same visit. Head simmered down to a single finger and is just sitting there showing no signs of moving. Lacing is foamy and permanent. Halfway into drinking I still see thick foam rings at the top. YUMMY.
The smell is of a champagne or heavy chardonnay on the sour side but I am really liking the smell of this which is strange because I do not like to smell champagne or chard. Smelling wines is something you do for Cabbys (IMHO). Perhaps the beer is helping round this one out.
I love the taste of this beer. If I could get more of it easier I'd drink it regularly. I like the sour notes, not something I like in beer very much but this one is balanced (more so then supplication for me) and the carbonation in the taste and mouthfeel help the sour become something you want to taste as oppose to swallow quickly.
This is the most unique thing I have tasted in years. Russian River has a unique style and often I can taste the russian river signature in all of thier beers. Temptation has the russian river flavor without the piney aftertaste you find in some of thier other offerings that I often find over powers some of the better qualities of thier work.
My only complaint is that I wish the bottle was as big as the Damnation bottles. 
If you are passing through Santa Rosa and also like champagne and Wine this beer offers a balance between the two worlds.
On a final note I'd say not to let the champagne/chardonnay-like part of the review scare you away from this one. Its a beer with similar qualities is all. 1,839 charactersIrishCowboy, Jan 02, 2006

I bought this in CA a few weeks ago, opened for New Years Eve. The bottle says "Blond ale aged in oak barrels." The bottle goes on to say the oak barrels are Chardonay barrels.
After trying the Supplication last night, I was prepared for this one to taste like a sour beer. It did. Strange for a beer, but a reasonable alternative for a sparkling white wine.
I liked this better than Supplication, maybe because I expected the sour taste this time. But probably I won't have it again. 542 charactersTurdFurgison, Jan 01, 2006

Gotta say, I love the mini magnum. Coolest bottle ever. I would rate it s 5.
Very interesting brew. Almost tasted like champagne. Very fruity. Effervescent and refreshing. Definitely some tartness in there. Like a quasi cantillon. A bit sour, but not in a bad way. 
I don't know what makes this beer wild, but yeah, it's interesting as hell. I hada hard time putting scores to this one. I think I would like to try it again to really see what I think. Glad for the opportunity though. 519 charactersLnedrive14, Dec 26, 2005
4.11/5  rDev -6.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412/25/05- Purchased at Ledger's Liquors in Berkeley, CA.
Presentation- 375ml bottle, caged and corked from the first batch ever bottled. Poured into my Duchese chalice.
Appearance- Pilsner golden color with a nice clouded vision. A solid 3/4 inch head forms with a full 1/4 inch remaining all the way down. Beautiful lace kisses almost the enitire glass.
Smell- Ahh, more barnyard funk, with a touch of oak and hops!
Taste- Drank immeadiately after the Supplication and found the same tartness to be there, in fact more so. This time the sourness stays in the aftertaste and lingers a bit. Slight touches of vinous notes and maybe a wee bit of oak treat the pallete to a nice suprise. Hops are plentiful as you notice them immediately.
Mouthfeel- Medium carbonation level, tart and sour to the back of the tongue.
Drinkability- Another winner from Mr. C. A different approach to a blonde ale to be sure, but a winner nonetheless. 947 charactersGClarkage, Dec 25, 2005

A - a golden straw color with hues of lemon rind and a good amount of white head. Very bubbly inside.
S - good tartness like rice vinegar and faint forest scent. I dont know how else to describe it.
T - Ahhhh, good firm sourness that's well rounded. The sweetness and maybe spice are more pronounced in this one as opposed to the Supplication. There is a detectable oak or barrel in the taste that works with this. I could also taste faint flavors that i taste when i have a hefe, very faint though.
M&Dr - very bubbly and good on the palate. Dry and cider like. Very tasty this one. I do prefer the Supplication, but this one is damn good as well. 719 charactersSwillinBrew, Dec 21, 2005

Appearance: Hazy gold body, head is smaller than I expected, but still about 3/4". Lots of visible carbonation in the body.
Smell: Tart, funky and fruity much like a Flanders Red Ale . Smell is pretty much what I would expect from the style, as this is my first sample I have had from it.
Taste: Slightly sweet and highly tart flavors make up the forefront of the flavor, with an earthy wood flavor. Different, but familiar to what I have seen from Belgians that use wild yeast. 
Mouthfeel: Feels a little watery going down, but that combines with the tartness of this beer to create an interesting effect. Metalic coating in the mouth afterwards.
Drinkability: Another example of American brewers taking a well established style and making it their own. I like the innovation, and would like to see more from the style. Thanks to OldFrothinSLosh for the bottle. 1,048 charactersTastyTaste, Dec 21, 2005

A- Clear orange gold hue, etching in Duvel glass expresses a beautiful trail of bubbles that hold the white lace together. Speaking of the lace ... absolutely wonderful as it sticks all over the glass.
S- Farmy aroma with a goat-like white wine smell. Suggestions of lemons, sour cherries and wet grass. Hint of phenols and a refined fusel alcohol in the back.
T- Cherry tartness ... BANG! Underlying lime edge, a touch of mineral / salts. Biscuity bread crust maltiness, very dry. Very faint on the wood. Fruity all over with a hidden warming alcohol. Leafy hop character holds a restrained bitterness.
M- Creamy mouth feel, fluffy, light and dry.
D- So flavorful and interesting it is hard to put down. We could easily sip this all night long.

Lovely pale amber color, nearing orange, completely cloudy, witha thick, sturdy snowy cushion of foam above.
Potent aromatics, screaming sour from afar....on closer inspection, yup, that's tart, with citrus and spice squeaking in...deep, heady stuff....beautiful.
Sourness is the main game in the mouth, blasting the tongue, then fading gently. Bracingly tart. Then smooth, but never releasing the hold of the tart, accompanied by some fruit and a bit of spice. Nice. 
Full-bodied and fresh. Zesty, snappy, tangy...quite an accomplishment, matching the quality of Belgian ales so well that if you didn't know, you'd swear this bottle crossed an ocean. 
Fine and mellow, this tempting ale. Delightful. Delicious. D'lovely. 809 charactersfeloniousmonk, Dec 06, 2005
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Temptation draws intentional and immediate comparisons to wine. The beers character develops during 12 months of aging in French oak wine barrels where it undergoes a secondary fermentation with Brettanomyces. It then gains a third fermentation in corked bottles. This produces a sour, white wine aroma with brisk, giddy carbonation feeding a soft film of head. The brew is very blond, mostly clear, and delivers a violent uncorking.
Temptation expertly showcases the refined complexities of its oak pedigree. The tart acidity of its long-term relationship with Brett yields a champagne-like expression. The beer boasts a wealth of artistry and sophistication and would achieve sublime expression in the company of sliced Jonagolds and farmers cheese. A standout example of contemporary west coast beercraft.

The Temptation pours a very hazy orange/yellow color with a nice thick and sparkling head.
The first few sips of this beer definitely reminds you that it has been aged in Chardonnay barrels for an extended period of time and then you get the sour and bitterness that is trademark RR. 
I wish the bottle was a 25oz because I could have enjoyed this much longer but at $16 a bottle I was limited myself to one...for now.
After my first try of the Temptation I will befinitely age the bottle I have at home and try it a few more time at Monk's because this is another winner from Russian River. Great job Vinnie. 760 charactersggaughan, Nov 24, 2005
4.04/5  rDev -8.4%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Picked up by BA RedwoodGeorge for the trade with me, this beer came in an oddly sized (375 ml) corked brown bottle, with a wire cage to finish the package. The cork came out resoundingly, and the beer started forming head in the bottle before pouring! The vigorous carbonation action continued unabated in the oversized wine glass, and the head that formed kept building up over the first few minutes rather than dissipating, and at the end of this spectacle, the head crowned an inch above the rim of the glass in the shape of a volcano.
The body underlying Mount Temptation was pale, cloudy, and very bubbly. The aroma was soured unripe cherries and fresh cut hay. There was also a little more alcohol in the nose than I was expecting. The taste was oh so dry and tart. Not quite as mouth-puckeringly acidic as a gueze lambic, this beer still had a similar taste of a lemon-lime juice mixed with wheat ale. There was also a peppery zing followed by a tannic woody flavor, and a hint of sweetness. Unlike a true lambic, there was no horse blanket funk here.
The finish was smooth and vanilla-creamy, and the aforementioned sweetness a little more noticeable in the aftertaste. This beer exhibited a very complex flavor profile, and yet remained quite drinkable and refreshing. 1,283 charactersrajendra82, Nov 21, 2005
4.82/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After much deliberation, I tried this one at Monk's. 
Pours out a cloudy yellow-gold with a very small white head that recedes slowly and leaves a little bit of lacing. Not an overwhelming beer to look at. 
Smell is pure brett and chardonnay, with some grapes, peach, and oak coming through. 
Flavor is incredible. It's got so much going on. It tastes like chardonnay as it hits your tongue, with a big dry grape flavor and some light fruitiness, but it gradually gives way to a nutty, almost cheese-like beer flavor that lets a lot of peach, graph, and honeydew flavors come in. Lemon and yeast flavors read pretty well, too. 
Mouthfeel is a spritzy medium, meeting the flavor perfectly. 
Overall: Wow. I thought this one would be overhyped, but I thought it was incredible. Surely worth seeking out. 816 characterswhartontallboy, Nov 10, 2005
3.4/5  rDev -22.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3I aged this for almost a year after purchase on a reccomendation from the beer manager at High times near newport beach. Popped the cork on a special occasion served in a small tulip.
Golden with Orange hue around the edges. Head and lacing are lacking.
First gulp reminded me of a chardonay. Big grape, sour, bitter, and some sweetness to finish. Some oak, wooded, earthy interior but mostly this brew reminded me of a fine chardonay with more carbonation and earthy tones to it.
I really think this should be aged a long long time. I aged it but it didn't settle down yet. Give this one a few years. For now its a glorified wine. 640 charactersDogFood11, Nov 06, 2005
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This one by far one of the most unique beers I have ever had the privilege to drink. The color was light golden with a large head, which left exquisite lacing. You could possibly mistake the appearance and/or bouquet for champagne, but with much less carbonation. The aroma was outstanding, with heavy French oak, vanilla and mild citrus. 
I was still trying to figure out how to describe the taste an hour after finishing my glass. I have to agree with the cliché and mention the wine-like taste (possibly some tannins?), with pear, apple, vanilla, oak, starting off sour and leaving a VERY long, sweet, smooth aftertaste of sweet fruits and banana on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel was also excellent and smooth and creamy. 
I could definitely drink this with dinner or stand-alone. It was refreshing and nearly perfectly balanced; leaving me wanting to check out the rest of what Russian River has to offer. Do yourself a favor and pick up one of these. 962 characterssinistrsam, Nov 02, 2005
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 001, poured into a wine glass.
Appearance: A hazy golden yellow, huge head, and fervent, spidery lacing around the glass. 
Smell: Tons of stuff going on, the oak from the barrels, vinous characteristics, some fruit like pear and sour cherries, some lemon, slight vanilla. Ridiculously balanced and you don't want to get your nose out of it. 
Taste: Mostly sour at first, but this is a sour of balance, of taste, of beauty. Some light fruit like the pear and cherries comes through, the oak and vanilla comes through, and yes, the sourness. It's an altogether fantastic combination, beautifully done in all aspects. The aftertaste lingers in such great ways, too. It stays on the back of the tongue, enhances everything. And there's also some light banana as it sits on the tongue. Wowness. Is this a wine? No, this is a beer, and it should be treated as such. 
Mouthfeel: Silky, creamy, perfectly carbonated. Drink slowly, savor, and swish this sucker around to see what's really going on. 
Drinkability: I give it a 5 because I could drink this all day, every day. 8.5%? Are you serious? Immaculately hidden, and that's not even the point. This is a fine, fine beer. Worth the $8.99 for the 12.7 oz. bottle? Yes. Expensive? Yes. But worth it? Again, yes. I have a bottle of Supplication waiting for me, and it's slightly ineffable how juiced I am for this. Try this, you owe it to yourself. 1,412 charactersasabreed, Oct 28, 2005
4.01/5  rDev -9.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5My first 5 for appearance, and it's well deserved. The head was ample and fluffy. The lacing as intricate as a snowflake. The body a rich gold, slightly cloudy. 
The mouthfeel was chewy and soft, which wasn't surprising judging by the fluffy head.
I could smell a strong alcohol taste before I took my sip. The taste was balanced between tart and sweet at first, and then seesawed mostly toward tartness as I finished. There were some hints of fruits and malt to add just a tinge of complexity. I think that the strength of the tartness diminished the drinkability a bit, but if there had been another waiting in my fridge when I was done, I still would have put it out of its misery. 690 charactersGnomeKing, Oct 28, 2005

Aged in oak chardonnay barrels, the aroma certainly shows it. Apples, pear, oak in the nose. The cork smelled like ripe apples too. I couldn't get enough of the aroma. This beer is dry, fruity and light bodied. Some earthiness, fruitiness, some characteristics of white wine. An extremely enjoyable and truly unique beer. 391 charactersbaiser, Oct 24, 2005
3.9/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I had some very high expectations... they weren't entirely met. 
Pours very orange/coppery/slightly cloudy. Some big bubbles in the head. Very white. Great stickage to the glass. Looks very, very nice. 
First whiff was pure chardonnay... apples, pear, oak, alcohol. Wow. Second whiff was the same, only with a slight hint of some malt... finally reminding me it was a beer.
The palate was very dry and gone quickly. This is where I got a tad dissapointed. It was very good, but was gone. Tart, tannic, and appley, but not a great finish. That's the only draw back in my opinion.
It really is hard to tell this is a beer. I would drink it again. 656 charactersFugazme, Oct 18, 2005

As the head dies down streaks and some rings remain. Tart fruity aroma with some interesting white wine notes that are integrated nicely. A bit of lemon and some funkiness to it as well. A bit lambic like and very unique. The flavor starts with a bit of sweet fruit with a nice tartness along side it. Some woody notes and funky Brett things are going on as well. Similarities to wine and lambic show through. All the different flavors pull together very well. Very smooth and well carbonated. For the complexities going on in this its really drinkable stuff. A unique and delicious beer that everyone should try. 699 charactersmeathookjones, Oct 14, 2005
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a pale malt scent that is overridden with tart bacteria and yeast aroma. It's almost lambic in nature. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and tart. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a damn fine brew. It's light and refreshing with a kick ass sour finish that's a bit warm on the way down. This is a great drinker. 549 charactersWesWes, Oct 08, 2005

Taste is really nice mixture of the underlying blonde ale and the bret used during the process. Funky, but not overwhelming so.
Very smooth mouthfeel.
This one is quite drinkable due to being funky and having a good underlying blonde taste.
Had at Tria in Philly with a raw milk sheep cheese. A pretty good pairing. 371 charactersGeoffFromSJ, Oct 03, 2005
4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presented in a 12.7oz corked and caged bottle bearing a batch number (001 in this case) that's nearly lost amongst all the data about and instruction on how to properly enjoy this brew. Following the label's advice, I pulled out my handy-dandy Duvel glass and popped the cork.
Appearance: darker than I recall from my samplings at the ABF last June. Similar to wet straw. Sported a 1" deep spritzy white head that left ghostly etchings of lace behind and was easily recalled by a light swirling of the glass.
The nose fairly barked vino as the aroma of chardonney seized my nostrils. Quick to follow was the note of oaken woodiness and, on a lesser level, vanilla bean. The label mentions the use of Brett in the brewing - no kidding. The aroma easily stands out. Kinda like once you smell a meth lab, you KNOW it's a meth lab. Same kind of thing going on here.
The taste is a happy marriage of beer and wine as the parching chardonney flavor wrestles with the funkiness of the Brett for something that begs description but is hard to put into words. Oak and vanilla somewhat smooth things out but the dryness and tartness is inescapable. Citric tang is also present. This is one wild ride for the taste buds. The feel is light shading toward medium, smooth and bone-dry.
Overall, I think this could become like liquid meth for me. Glad I have another bottle but wish they were bigger than these puny not-quite 13oz runts. Time for Temptation to be bomber-ized, methinks. Anyway, another fabulous beer by Vinnie and the crew at Russian River. 1,546 charactersBoilermaker88, Sep 26, 2005
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours from the 12.7oz mini champagne-style, corked & caged bottle a light straw colour with a thick white head. The bottle has a nice long ramble about the beer, and says Batch #1.
Smell is musty and sour up front, with green apple and a slightly oaky scent.
Taste is amazingly complex. It stars off sour and acidic, with nice bright fruity flavours. Mouthfeel is light to medium, with spicy alcohol presenting itself as it warms. Oak flavours again are present, and complement it perfectly. Finishes with winey grape flavours, then trails off to a dry sourness.
This beer is very drinkable, but I'm not sure how many bottles I could have in a row. I love lambics, and was pleasently surprised by this my first taste of an American Wild Ale. Very impressive, and I hope to try more of these. 800 charactersBeervis, Sep 14, 2005
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Lightly hazy, dull gold in hue with a sunshiny amber-coppery highlight; the liquid looks well enough but Ive seen more eye-catching. The head was white in color, at the foams heights point the tinny bubbles bonded long enough to create one-finger of froth. Head retention was fair; it quickly subsided to a thin, soapy cap. About halfway through my slow sipping a thin, half collar was all that remained. I wish the head retention was better, something needed to liven-up the appearance. There wasnt much subsequent lacing, only a few splashes of foam. I like how this beer looks but it is far from remarkable. 
The nose is totally Belgian. Hardcore Belgian! [Note: I say Belgian but I realize that Brett and oak-aging and whatnot are not just Belgian things. Still, I cant help but feel a Belgian connection even if RR didnt want one or not]. Lambic bloodlines, I bet the daddys name was Brett. It is funky. It is acidic. Lightly earthy but more so green apples, white grapes, and pears, hints of oak with some lemon zest. Sour candy. At the back are hints of white wine. Firm but yielding potency, the bouquet is very articulate. It is Belgium in a glass via Northern California... either that, or it is uniquely American via Russian River. The nose is inviting for me but for you? I dont know. The nose warns the weak and summons the brave. I am about to answer its call.
The first half sip was disappointing. It was clean. WTF? By the swallow, oh my does this beer develop wonderfully. The lemony acidity with a sour underbelly is truly amazing. Ive never had a beer with such an exposed soul. It is gentle but demanding. This little aspect is so flavorful. There is not much flash here; it is just some straightforward yeasty influences. There are dry white wine notes, oak, and acidic with some tangy candy, some fruitiness, wheat, and even some vanilla. The palate is complex but I think I can figure it out, which isnt a good or bad thing. All in all, the flavor profile is stunning, especially the lemony aspects. That vibe alone makes this beer noteworthy. I want to call this beer clean but I think what Im feeling is just a very well put-together (and fresh) beverage. It is very tasty I mean, scrumptious to the nth degree. Impressive, from first to last sip.
Medium in body, light but ticklish carbonation plays with the acidity to create a refreshing and enjoyable mouthfeel. There is a long aftertaste which is a culmination of everything detected on the palate. It is warm and a little raw on the throat but I would have never guessed this beer was over 7% abv. Wow.
Wow again. This beer is a drinkable beast. I need a thesaurus because I cant stop calling this beer impressive. Tart. Acidic. Funky. Bitter. Citrusy. And truly brilliant! I havent had many beers like this, if any. As good as the palate is the drinkability is the shinning achievement here. It is refreshing, enjoyable, and complex but no to the point that it cant be conquered. I am happy I purchased a bottle online from RR, it was worth every cent. Recommended.

4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Hazy golden sandy blonde. Head is white, small, lasting. Very vinous nose contains strong farmy and funky notes that seems to multiply the fruit presence. Banana bread soaked in cider and banged around with tart white grapes. Globally very fresh and classy, yet you feel this would survive many years. The palate is delicate, flowery and vibrantly tart in a pineapple way. Fresh fruitiness brings the complexity through the roof. It somehow manages to remain accessible thanks to a striking balance and transcendent "classiness". Bretty cobwebs, cidery salty minerals. Satisfying, juicy, yet dry. Firm champaigny carbonation, smooth palate. My new favorite from Vinnie. 669 charactersRastacouere, Sep 12, 2005

Pours to a clear golden-yellow with a creamy white head. Leaves a nice amount of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is sour and tart with a lemony/herbal funkiness. Very nice. The flavor is yeasty, funky with a nice subtle oakiness. It has a bit of sour fruitiness throughout as well. It is very smooth drinking for such a high octane brew.
I like it. Special thanks to Stubob SweatPants for sharing this one. I know I will never hear the end of it, how I never bring shit to the table except for Strohs. 541 charactersBeerBuilder, Sep 11, 2005

Smoke billows forth from the bottle for several seconds after the cork is twisted off. Hazy, golden yellow body is topped by three inches of bonewhite custard meringue. Excellent head retention and very attractive chains of small bubbled foam lace the glass.
Aroma is lambic and geuze-like, with a heavy presence of oak wood. Very sour lemon and the tartest of cherries mingle with a dirty cattleyard Brett funkiness. Very earthy and woodsy, as the oak notes waver between sawed wood and vanilla. Floral hops serve up notes of a greenhouse of botanicals. Exceptional bouquet.
Mouthfeel has a medium body and frisky carbonation, becoming satiny as it warms.
Taste is extremely complex. Lambic sourness and lemony acidity are immediately noted. Strong oak presence wavers between vanilla and sawed wood, as in the aroma. Chardonay wine notes abound, and white grapes join a pear and cherry fruitiness as it reaches room temperature. Strange Brett notes are very much a part of the profile and add an odd earthy note. Not barnyard as in the aroma, but difficult to describe from sampling just one bottle. Honey drenched green apples appear briefly toward the close, but the finish is ultimately dry, lemony, and oaky. Wow! This is as complex a profile as I've encountered.
 Drinkability is limited only by price and availability. Amazing complexity as each sip brings forth a different note. An exceptional sipping experience here. Don't drink this one any colder than cellar temperature. Room temperature brings out all sorts of interesting flavors and aromas. Very playful on the nose and palate. Incredibly well constructed. 1,726 charactersmerlin48, Sep 11, 2005

Unleashing the cork from the cage and liberating it from the bottle sends forth a cascade of wild aromas including a mouth-watering sourness from Bret. The nose is farmhouse saison all the way!
From a cheek tingling entry to a chardonnay finish as crisp as the first cold autumn night, this beer is complex and seemingly changes 'moods' as it warms. 
While chilled, it is subdued...yet vibrant. As it warms, the midtaste dances on the rear of the tongue with a myriad of funky treasures. The mouthfeel is a palate-pleasing contrast between spikey carbonation and velvety yeast strains. 
Spectacular! 648 charactersIceAce, Sep 11, 2005

Pours a hazy apple juice color with a blond hue, an off white frothy head, some lacing, and evident carb action.
Ahh, a very crisp sour dough and cheesy malt smell with a pine and citrus hops aroma.
Moderately sweet, bitter, and acetic cheesy malt taste and a grassy, spruce, grapefruit, and lemon/lime hops flavor.
Medium bodied, slightly syrupy texture, soft and kind of fizzy carbonation, and a smooth pleasantly astringent and maybe slightly chalky finish.
An excellent balanced beer some what like a Lambic, chewy, smooth, and has a long lasting crisp grapefruit aftertaste. Note: the bottle states 7.25% abv. and was empty before I could finish the review. 878 charactersTroyone, Sep 06, 2005
4.23/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance and Presentation  12.7 oz caged and corked bottle. Labeled batch #1. White head with good retention and lacing. The color is a light golden yellow.
Smell  Fruity cherries, oak and definitely some sourness. As the beer warms the alcohol pokes through just a bit in addition to floral hints. Unique certainly.
Taste  Smooth oakiness at the front, slightly sour and dry in the back. The grapey wine flavor shows through in the aftertaste. Nicely balanced, the sourness is less than expected from a beer made with wild yeast.
Mouthfeel  Smooth with medium carbonation and a medium body.
Drinkability and Notes  A really interesting beer, but not one that I am overly in love with. The wine like character makes this slow, but enjoyable to drink. Glad I picked it up when I saw it, but not sure if I would get another at the steep price. 865 charactersOldSock, Sep 05, 2005

The aroma was slightly acidic with a grapeskin/seed aromatic found in many lambics. Some fruity and earthy character melded with oak was most notable and in the forefront. A slight spice and a low citrus were also present.
The flavor was light with an oak flavor and vanilla when the beer first contacted the palate. The oak flavor was light and lasting with a citric and acidity that assisted with drying out the beer. The flavor was very complex with a nice lemony citrus and light fruitiness coupled with a slight spice and vanilla and light peper. The complexity of the flavor was interesting and well done.
The finish was dry and relatively benign with only a light oak, vanilla and citrus that drifted away in the finality of the aftertaste. The body was just below medium and creamy due to the carbonation level. An extremely interesting beer that definitely falls into the category of American Wild Ale and stands apart from the crowd.

Oh, the nose...huge American funk. I've never smelled this before. The oakiness, the wild nose, the vinous character blended into a single olfactory blitz that I was praying didn't overpromise. The taste was bone dry, woody, grapeskin, with a funkiness throughout. Then at the end, a swell of zest before a long soft cheesy finish. I remember spontaneously yelling some euphoric expletives while sitting at the bar.
Capital Ale had just put some bottles in the cooler. They had entered the pricing in the system which wouldn't be available to the next day. I nabbed one, price unseen, and the manager had to key it into the register. The 375ml bottle ran $21. Takes it out of the "I'll have two more" range. But, damn, this is a great, original beer. 859 characterspentathlete, Aug 26, 2005

Pours a pale orange yellow with a very nice two finger white head. The head gives way to a decent white lacing and a very nice white collar. A fine looking beer even if head retention is kind of lousy.
Smell is oak, musty yeast, some lactic sourness. There is a definite fruitiness (grapes, pears, peaches) makes itself known.
Taste is somewhat sour, but not nearly what I would have expected given the style. Fruits make themselves known (chardonay grapes, pears, peaches, etc). Followed by a massive oaky flavor as well as spicy and bitter hops.
Mouthfeel is pretty damn impressive. Dry, smooth and all enjoyable.
Overall, I could easily drink this one all night. Plain and simple, I could just have this all the time. Russian River continues to prove to me that they are an amazing brewery and Vinnie is just an amazing brewer. This beer is phenominal. 883 charactersLuckySevens82, Aug 25, 2005

hazy and foamy carbonated apple cider appearance.. some frothy lacing.. poured into a flutelike fischer tasting glass. pleasant barnyard aroma with buttery wood notes and a bready yeast that dulls the beer's potential for unbridled funk. tastes like a mild lambic infused with the chardonnay from the barrels.. love the dryness this imparts. splitting a bottle of this two ways yields too small a sample to get too much out of.. not to mention that when served chilled, this is a refreshing, thirst quenching beer that you just can't put down. alcohol is mild and all that makes a wild ale a sipper is muted here. a pretty excellent brew, not nearly as complex a brew and worthy of the hype as supplication. ill have no problem drinking the remaining bottles of this beer in my closet. will certainly re-review with further notes when i can hog one of these bad boys for myself. 923 charactersgoodbyeohio, Aug 18, 2005

This was a light amber, hazy beer with a one finger, white, dense foamy head that persisted throughout the experience. It left a lot of foam on the glass.
Aroma was of white wine and oak, but a little sour too. Very complez, not quite like a beer... damn, I love when beers are aged this way. They become so much more.
Taste was even more complex than the aroma. Massive Chardonnay and oak notes, and some maltiness thrown in. Slightly sour, but not out of place... it served to tie everything together.
Mouthfeel was smooth and mellow... a little foamy, too.
Drinkability was excellent... I had to make myself slow down to let it last, as this was all I had and all I would have for a long time. But I think I may well trade for this one again. 879 charactersconnecticutpoet, Aug 16, 2005

appearance: pours a hazy caramelly orange with tangerine hilights in my favorite snifter. 2" fluffy white head that dropped to about a quarter inch quickly. the lacing and sticking is near perfect. stream of bubbles rise from the stem.
smell: very aromatic. lemon citrusy with a soapy clean grape aroma. bubble gum, wheat and perfume. love the bouquet! 
taste: salty and lightly spicy wine/champagne. very vinous flavor. nice sour lemony acidic finish. light bitterness. not overly complex, but very flavorful. alcohol is well masked. incomparable to any beer i've ever had previously. 
mouthfeel: unusually crisp while also creamy. there's an amazing champagne carbonation that you feel at the top of your throat when you swallow. smooth. love it.
drinkability: every sip begs for more. the bottle is deceivingly small, and when you finish, you check the label to make sure it wasn't less than 12oz. where did it go? alcohol is almost completely masked. the true "champagne of beers". (sorry miller high life) 
overall: what can i say? i love it. i have one other bottle that i'm gonna lay down, but i don't know if i can be patient. i ordered this from russian river's website and it was worth every penny. (almost $12 after shipping) i also have some supplication waiting in the fridge, and that's supposed to be better. it'd almost have to be perfect to be better than temptation. 2 enthusiastic thumbs. 2,015 charactersPx2GrafX, Aug 09, 2005

4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5375 ml bottle- very oddly shaped, but after trying the Supplication, I could not wait to try this one as well.
Cage comes off and cork comes out with a very solid pop-thunk, and a lot of gunsmoke. Aroma of wood and sour lambic-style funk and, yes, chardonnay come a running before I even get this poured. That gets high aroma marks all on its own.
But it pours an orangy-golden with a medium white head in my Duvel glass that is actually smaller than I would expect. A steady stream of carbonation keeps a little bit of head going for quite a while (not long, see drinkability below). Nice-even very nice, but not just screaming to be drunk.
But here's the aroma again. I would be remiss if this isn't a 5, just for its complexity and uniqueness... I can't pretend to tellyou what all is going on. Lambic-like, but not. Funky, but not overly harsh.
Flavor- this could be a glass of wine. Perhaps not a Chardonnay, but it's dry, white-grapes, and there's a lot going on in this wine, I mean beer. Complex. Wow. Not sharp-sour like a lambic, much more mellow and accessible without being plain. This has a lot of goodness going on here!
Mouthfeel is lush and very comfy, it would be better if this stuff wasn't so damned drinkable. 1,244 charactersDukeofearl, Aug 04, 2005

This is very well made with so much depth and complexity but sublte like a good white wine or gueze. Unlike supplication, it should be enjoyed colder. Warming didn't hurt but it didn't help.

4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 2, Sampled December 2007
It was definitely a slight mistake to serve this at near cellar temperatures (60ºF / 15.5ºC), as the beer foamed up and started gushing as soon as I popped the cork. I only lost a couple ounces though. The beer forms a frothy, scant fat-one-finger thick, pale, off white colored head that is actually quite persistent. The beer is a hazy, slightly chunky, orange tinted, dark straw color. The oak character seems much subdued from the first batch (which is a good thing as this was my main complaint with that beer). This is nice and funky, notes of urea, aromatic goat, farmhouse-stinky-cheese, a definite cattiness, mushroom spore and a host of sharp phenolics that at times approaches fresh curing plastic. Underneath the funk is a nice fruit character reminiscent of tart, un-ripened white grapes (sauvignon blanc & gewürztraminer come to mind), as well as touch of green apple and tart pear aromas. The aroma on this is really quite nice, it is definitely ringing my funky bone right now.
Tart, but not aggressively so (at least for this Gueuze addict), it is somehow soft and creamy feeling, despite the still present carbonation. This creaminess has definitely been picked up in the barrel as oak notes add some tongue coating softness to this brew and even some heft to the body; suggestive from the butter-like oak flavors this makes the beer actually feel buttery in texture. Soft oak contributions of vanillin, a definite sharp spiciness and perhaps a hint of buttery-oak notes are all found here, though the spicy notes are definitely the largest oak character here. The wine analogy continues as the process used is definitely a contributor; definitely reminiscent of an oaky chardonnay as this beer has flavors of green fruit, star-fruit, flint, a certain light metallic quality and that definite oak presence. The funky wee-beasts and the oak contribute spice notes of white pepper, piquant ginger, The flavor is not quite as funky as the aroma might have suggested, but I think this is ultimately a good thing as it allows the complexity of the fruit, oak and spiciness to come through. The sourness, while present and definitive, is so well integrated that it is not overly noticed on its own.
The oak character is much more in check with this the second batch. This is a far superior beer in my opinion (and it hasn't taken anywhere near 5 years as I last predicted) as the oak, while present, now plays a supporting role. If successive batches keep getting better, then I am going to need to re-baseline my scoring. Just a fantastic brew. The texture is phenomenal & the flavor is just so well integrated and nuanced. The aroma, while absolutely engaging and complex, may actually be a bit too funky. Let me explain that though, because I absolutely love funk and the funk found in the aroma, while dominant, is so well integrated together, but it is a bit too dominant to let the nuanced oak, grape and malt notes through (despite being so inviting and characterful). I may even need to crack a batch 1 just to see what is happening to that .I still maintain that these 375ml bottles just aren't quite enough, as I always want more of this brew after draining my glass. Though if it was a 750's worth, my proliferous text might be pushing the extremes of my already superfluous text.
Batch 1, Sampled June 2006
4/4/4/4.5/4.5 total 4.1
Pours a lightly hazy orange-copper color, it is pretty well carbonated and has a frothy pale, almost white head. The aroma is quite oaky with lots of buttery notes, an astringent woodiness, notes of grapes (perhaps sauvignon or chardonnay), notes of pears, and some subtle spice notes. Quite an interesting nose on this one.
The beer is quite light on the palate, and very dry. The dryness actually suppresses the oakiness a bit, but it is definitely still here. The finish is quite long with a subtle tannic woodiness to it. There is a light acidity (for a Lambic at least) here as well, more similar to the lactic character of a Lambic than the acetic character of a Flemish sour beer. I am really quite relieved that I don't get any diacetyl in this beer (I am quite sensitive to it), there is a bit of buttery character (mostly in the aroma), but this is definitely oak derived. There is a certain spritzy character to this beer that is a combination of the carbonation and the acidity.
This beer is really quite interesting, Vinnie still has a ways to go, but this has more to do with letting the barrels reach an equilibrioum point than Vinnie at this point. I think that Vinnie has the touch, in perhaps 5 years (if the wee bugs are compliant and amenable), subsequent releases of this should be quite stellar. 4,711 charactersGueuzedude, Jul 15, 2005
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a slightly cloudy light amber with two fingers of dimpled egg-white head, good retention.
The chardonnay comes into the aroma rather aggressively, bringing vinous notes and bright, tart, light fruit. Behind there's slight must, a hint of tartness, but really the brett is rather subdued in the aroma right now. No actual oakiness noticable in the aroma.
Sweet jebus. I don't know where to begin with the taste on this thing. Holy freakin' monkey. There is so much going on and all so subtle. There's the chardonnay fruit again, but it's only a light accent in the back. The brett is definately there - horsey-edged cherry tartness. Uber-dry in the mouth, scouring the edges of the palate with insane, indiscernable flavor. The oak flavor is noticable, providing a rounded, darker element in the back, but none of the unpleasant tannins that I've found in other oaked beers. Tart and effervescent up front, backed by crisp chardonnay fruit, then finished with dry horse-funk and deep & buttery oak. Freakin' mind-blowingly good.
Thank you Vinnie. Thank you for pushing the bounds of beer, and thank you for making, in the heart of wine country, beer that can stand up to the scrutiny of the wine establishment. The making of this beer is true beer advocacy. 1,271 charactersCrotor, Jul 07, 2005

(Brewed on 27-Mar-04 and Bottled on 14-May-05)
Primary: Bastogne Ale Yeast (White Labs)
Conditioning: R.R. Wine 1
Listed as:
7.25%ABV / 1.062 O.G / 27 BUs
Presentation: 12.70 fluid ounce (375ml) greeny-brown glass bottle which has a rather unique look to it, flask like the dimpled underside and wide base with the tall proboscis like neck lend it a wine bottle feel. Single grey-white obverse label has a picture of the Grim Reapers Scythe and is quite literally saturated with information about this brew. Principle data is that this is a Blonde ale aged for over 12 months in used French oak Chardonnay wine barrels. During this period Brettanomyces is added. Refermented in the bottle, it is listed at 7.25% Alc. By Vol.
Listed as Batch 001. Cork and Caged with a white steel cap which has the words Russian River Brewing Company on it. 
Appearance: I followed the guideline pictures of the preferred dispensing glass on the label and opted for my trusty Duvel Goblet. The head is white with a spumantean presentation that rings the glass edges with tidelines and produces a central volcanic eruption that produces a centrally located Hawaiian island which forms and rescinds constantly. The lacing is a sight to behold. Low level radioactive orange glow exhibits a healthy shine with a rustoleum blooming sheen from the body. Massive levels of dissolved carbonation impart a fluidic soda-like crashing oceanic wave on the shore feel when the glass is gently swirled. Pornographic looks.
Nose: Shattered aromas, sharp natural lemony citric elements fight hard with organic yeasty oak soaked white wine flashes which exhibit a light vanilla odor. Warm odors of recently full blown piss stained underwear reeks with a urinary tract acidity akin to that of the urea as it cools. A mild funky alcoholic woody trait lingers throughout with a smidgeon of Oak-aged Brett stained toilet paper. Urophilian Quercus odors with a disturbing urolagnian attraction - Funckin great!!!
Taste: Vanilla and Dill entrance the silky smooth, almost oily, Oak stained starting line. The naked white haired Chardonnay-stained oak lingers and plays a multi-racial cross-border game of hide the sausage with its long lost funky blonde haired Brett laden beery cousin, this one has six fingers for sure, but it also has two sets of genitals.a shockingly appealing Hermaphrodite of a fermented libation. Grape buggers Grain, I should be repulsed by that, but I keep one eye on this one throughout.
Mouthfeel: Slick oak aged vanilla feel on the tongue with some light alcoholic woody tones. Moderately huge, a low flying high baller, big but small, it has it both, hard to mark accurately, but it really is an easy 4.5. 
Drinkability: This is extremely thirst quenching from the get go. Temptation is a great name for this one. Highly Suppable!
Overall: Simply Superb!
White West-Coast Wine meets Blonde Belgium Beer.
Russian River. Once Tasted  Always Loved - Never Forgotten.
Another inspirational creation from the master brewer Vino-inie Cilurzo that I am sure the Beer Whore-Pimps will eulogize and remorselessly trade for all the wrong reasons. Get some and try it for the right ones!
Definitely not a Dumb Californian Blonde!!! 3,273 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Jul 01, 2005
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Another brilliant, brilliant brew from Vinnie and co. Appearance is great, bright golden with a huge fluffy white head that is bubbling over the chalice that this stuff is served in. Aromas are all Belgian funk and refreshingly hoppy/maly Belgian blond ale notes. The chardonnay barrels that this was aged in also impart some lovely light oak, and big fruity white wine grape notes. The mouthfeel is superb, creamy smooth, and unfaulted. Drinkability is absolutely insane. Refreshing and just killer. Damn, I love this stuff. A fantastic, one-of-a-kind brew! 558 charactersfrancisweizen, Jun 01, 2005
4.09/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Gold.
Well aged bottle.
Stunning, sour aroma of funk (brett), honey, melon, wood and dry, tropical fruits.
Lightly bodied. Quite flavoful. Wheaty, barnyard, leather, nice brett character,spices (possibly) along with a dry, almost winey (sauv blanc), oaked finish. Nice. 278 charactersCrosling, Oct 03, 2004
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and slightly yeasty. Medium bodied strong ale. Yeasty, malty and fruity. Touch of oak. Lighter flavored than most strong ales. There is a graininess to this one as well. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. 320 charactersbeerguy101, Sep 19, 2003
