Consumed 5/16/17
A: Golden tangerine with some yellow around the edges - hazy but not a turbid slurry - pours with a medium size white head, fades to a wispy, nearly solid cap, leaves above-average lacing
S: Punchy citrus, with some bright tangerine, orange, ruby red grapefruit - floral citrus - super juicy and tropical, with some very fresh peach, mango, melon, and a touch of pineapple - resinous, leafy hops - herbaceous - lightly sweet, pale malts
T: Bright citrus, with some juicy tangerine and orange - some citrus zest, touch of rind, floral citrus - straight-up hop cones, ripe herbal hops, touch of pine - tropical with tons of melon and mango - some peach - a hint of earth but mostly clean - moderate bitterness - pale malts, touch of cracker, light bread, clean finish
M: Medium body, very smooth, a touch oily, very clean
O: Win win for din din
After seeing some photos of the ridiculous lines associated with the acquisition of this beer, I more or less decided I could live without it. But here it is. And it's great. It fits that nice sweet spot between the clean West Coast and the hazy, juicy East Coast, much like some Hill Farmstead and Alchemist IPAs. This is worth seeking out, but it may not be worth waiting in line for multiple hours to acquire. 1,326 charactersangrybabboon, May 17, 2017

moderately pungent aromas of dankness, herbal/floral qualities, orange, grapefruit, oily citrus peel, mint, bready malts, pine. on palate is massive amounts of grapefruit, orange, peach, pineapple, melon, hint of mango, lemon, minty green ting, sweet bready malts, earthy spice, perfect amount of subtle piney bitterness on the finish. taste is so well rounded and comes together magically... solid lightish-medium body, has some nice fluffy texture to it. 
overall I think this beer is excellent. I traded a whale for this one, and I don't feel bad. probably worth seeking out if you love IPAs, especially if your looking for a more nuanced and balanced IPA. so enjoyable, had to really focus on savoring this and not just annihilating it due to the quality and drinkability 852 charactersHyptochrons, May 12, 2017
4.6/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Aromatic, smooth, citrus, crisp. The most aromatic beer I've ever encountered. Bottled some time in the early AM of 4/29, picked up by at 7AM and enjoyed my first sip at 4PM...so this is as fresh as can be, and boy does it show. The aroma is out of this world - citrus, leafy hops and light pine explode out of the bottle and fill the air above it like a low-lying cloud over a mountaintop. Unreal. Nothing can quite live up to an aroma like this but the taste and feel come close. Orange rind, pineapple, fresh cut grapefruit, pine and a touch of lemon. Crisp and somehow light, despite its DIPA-appropriate 8% ABV; no alcohol heat to be found. The malt holds up the hop-onslaught but does nothing to balance the flavor profile. Finishes clean with a lingering earthy spiciness. 16.9 ounces disappears quickly...and the lottery looms large as the beer is a must-have. 868 charactersManapuaMan, May 10, 2017

I don't know the hop bill on this (Maine guards that like the Crown Jewels are guarded), but it SCREAMS of a Mosaic/Citra combo, or maybe a South African varietal.  Whatever it is, it is dank, it is juicy, it is tropical - and it has a feel that has more bite than the ubiquitous NE-style IPA that is redefining the laws of beer, at least on BA.  A phenomenal beer,  IMHO. 572 charactersovaltine, May 08, 2017

Poured into a Teku glass a golden amber color with a finger of laced white foam. Heavy mango and tropical fruit notes in the nose with a bit of pine & a touch of funk. This is a stellar example of the NE IPA revolution of the last several years. As an imperial, you can pick up on a bit of alcohol, but not in a way detrimental to the overall flavor profile of the beer. Not as juicy as other NE IPAs, but you can definitely pick up on more complexities that can be drowned out by juicier IPAs. Overall, incredibly well balanced from look to finish and everything in between. Definitely worth the hype. 673 charactersumichfan, Apr 20, 2017

500ml into a perfect ipa glass
looks great in the glass. hazy yellow with a great eggshell whight fluffy head
aroma at first was a bit mute, but it definitly ramps up into juicy tropical fruit, great layers of hops, malty sweetness. very aromatic 
flavor definity packs a punch.ots of tropical fruit, nice sweet back bone. more tasty hops without any overwhelming bitterness. very good
mouthfeel is slick, a tad watery. hides the abv extremely well.
overall it's very good and deserves some recognition, but it's slightly behind the real best. i wouldn't turn it down ever tho!

Lacing sticks as you drink, leaving rings all the way to the bottom. It smells of rich and ripe tropical fruits, light dank, soft white bread. Tastes like it smells but in layers, fruits, dank, pine, bread, sooo good! Very balanced feel to it with a soft bite that fades when your ready for the next sip. Overall fantastic DIPA that I'll try to get a case of the next time sales are available. Seek this one out if your a hop head like me! Cheers. 685 charactersBEER88, Mar 02, 2017

MBC lives up to its reputation of making solid beers, but nothing earth-shattering.  This was a solid DIPA, but something in those hops exude too much earthy onion and garlic to get past before you get any good resin or citrus notes.  2 bottles were mailed to me in Winter: I drank one and gave the other to a friend for her birthday.  That's how little I cared.  Lunch was better. 467 charactersjmasher85, Mar 02, 2017

Look of my favorite cloudy double IPAs.
Smell of a hoppy grapefruit juice spiked smoothy.
Taste was just a tad disappointing, not quite up to Epiphany at the brewery, Sip of Sunshine on draft at a restaurant or, today, Neverender at the brewery.
Overall, a really good New England double IPA; up there with the best, but the competition keeps growing and I can get Epiphany most every weekend at 1 Industrial Way; that's a better use of my time than waiting in line to buy a case of Dinner. Also, if you want Maine Beer Company, Mo is just as good a drinking experience and, again, more readily available. 644 charactersLonborgski, Feb 21, 2017

Was lucky enough to get a ticket for a case.
Very pungent floral and fruity flavors. MBC malt flavors are some of my favorite and this one is at the top.  Often 8% ABV distracts from the flavor of hoppy brews, but in this case it works well. This is one of the best brewed beverages I've ever had.
Slightly over rated, but then again, ratings are just opinions. 385 charactersLoopy_Lupus, Feb 19, 2017
4.02/5  rDev -13.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy opaque orangey hue. Pillowy, cloudy head that you would totally sleep on because you would be smelling something so good in your dreams. Aromatic mango frooti. If y’all don’t know what that is, go to your local Patel Brothers and get some, may be you won’t have the beer, but you’ll have the aroma and flavor. 
Dinner is a combination of super soft honey dew and cantaloupe flesh, with a touch of mango. There’s zero to no bitterness which errs far from the MBC wheelhouse of bitter, earthy, but clean and well made West Coast IPAs on the Northeast coastline. 
It is so soft that I hope that the gorillas my $5 went to for buying a ticket have a similarly soft and inviting habitat. I hope those gorillas don’t have a damn worry in the world and only think about how comfortable they are. I hope they’re not worried about getting shot by a zookeeper because a dumb kid with irresponsible parents invaded their habitat. I hope they’re not worried about a poachers bullet. I hope they’re concerned with how comfortable they are and how comfortable they are only. Similarly, I feel that Dinner is only a one thought beer. It’s a one note beer. It’s a helluva a note, but it’s one note just the same. 
Could you just hear the first bend on Jimmy Page’s guitar on his solo for Stairway over and over again? Or do you need the rest of the solo in order to appreciate that first note? Dinner is undoubtedly a very nice beer. However, it’s Beethoven with only violins and missing the rest of the orchestra. The only thing it shares in common with Marcy Playground’s “Sex and Candy” is that it is also a one hit wonder. 
When I think of great IPAs, I think of ones that have everything. Multiple notes. Fruit and bitterness. An evolution of flavors. A veritable concerto to taste. Dinner is not those things. 1,850 charactersSheppard, Feb 19, 2017

Look: A medium orange slightly hazy tint. Lacing left most of the way up the glass.
Smell: An awesome fruit explosion. Tropical fruit comes through with pineapple and then some apricot or other similar aroma. A slight hint of pine in there reminds me of a more traditional IPA. 
Taste: Not the fruit monster I was expecting. It finishes sort of dry and a little bitter finish. 
Mouthfeel: Reminds me of other NE IPAs. A nice thickness to it, not too much. 
Overall: A nearly perfect balance of everything. Never would have pegged this to be a double IPA. The fruit mixes with the texture for a fantastic taste every sip. 
I am always hesitant to buy into the hype about these hard (nearly impossible) to get beers. This one definitely lives up to the hype and I highly recommend getting it if you can. 895 charactersKdouble, Feb 02, 2017

I have recently fallen hard for TH and Trillium, thinking I need to drink them all the time. They put forth fabulous beers, but "Dinner" reminds me that brewing is an art. It's all about balance here. There'a huge nose that appropriately advertises what's to come and flavors that almost keep up (in true MBC fashion it's very clean). Yet, nothing dominates. More so than some of the heavy handed hop bombs these days, this one makes you think. Balance beats the bombs.  A classic double that, at the same time,  acknowledges the newer players in the field. 
Well done, MBC. 602 charactersdtlyons11, Nov 13, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to mfurlone for a hop-for-hop trade early this month. 500ML bottle dated 8/20/16 with Maine’s trademark understated label. 
Pour: only about 2/3 of the bottle will go into my travel mug, so it’s clear orange for now. Smells of fruity tangerines & oranges, with some citrus repping the IPA tag. Smells like NE. 
Dinner: I already had one, but this is better than a Holiday Inn burger & fries (I gave it a B-). From sip one I can understand that appeal. The bitterness is rending up front, giving me that slightly tased top-of-the-mouth feel from aggressive hops. Counteracting the hop poisoning is most of a fruit bowl. Apricots, tangerines, grapefruit, probably some exotic Sumatran stuff I haven’t heard of & couldn’t pronounce. Finish is a mélange of odd flavors including wet dough (the yeast?), caramel, prairie grass. Thick enough to stand a lead spoon up in, & heavy enough in my swollen tummy to make me think this would be better in 12 oz. bottles. 
Excellent IPA. So many don’t live up to the hype. This one at least scrapes on the belly of the train. 1,085 charactersmaximum12, Sep 15, 2016

Beautiful hazy orange appearance with a descent head upon the pour.  Orange-mango-pineapple nose with a very faint hint of pine.  Taste is loaded with juicy tropical flavors, followed by a balanced, mildly sweet back bone.  Very easy to drink and glad I finally got to try this epic DIPA.  Are there better ones out there, sure... but this will measure up with the top tier. 400 characterseifster82, Sep 15, 2016

Appearance-color of pineapple juice with fantastic lacing , nice carbonation minimal head. 
Aroma - pine forrest,  then pineapple.  Very very nice
Taste- dankness immediately with pineapple citrus on back end.  Def west coast IPA.  Bitterness is evident
Mouthfeel-  not creamy like typical ne iPas.  However not watery at all.  Medium bodied .  Appropriate for style.  
Overall-  been waiting a long time to try this beer and it did not disappoint.  Not sure if beer is worth top 10 ranking but it is damn good.  Pine/pineapple combination is delicious, and bitterness is not hidden like most ne iPas.   This is a 94/100 beer 723 charactersjcflorian, Sep 06, 2016

Maine brewing is one of my favorite breweries. Far from one trick ponies, they are diverse, but intimate. This beer exemplifies their flawless representation of the simplicity in beer, while complex at the same time. I was almost done with hops until these guys showed me the light in MO over a year ago. Stay classy Maine. 361 charactersTheBlueWaffle, Sep 05, 2016

Orange in color with a medium-hazy look. 
Frutty on the nose, mostly pineapple and papaya. I also wanna say it has a pine quality to it, but it isn't dank or resinous. It is more of a fresh winter-green note; a little bit minty, or even like eucalyptus. 
Palate follows the nose upfront, with a peppery feel in the middle and a nice subtlely dry and bitter finish. No malt presence, even as it warms it.
Mouthfeel is full to medium. I've been drinking a lot of trillium and Tree House beers, so it feels a little bit aqueous; wish it was a little bit thicker.
Overall this a perfectly balanced beer with very nice fruit notes and some very unsual fresh deliciousness. One of my favorite beers ever. 733 charactersdiemilio, Aug 27, 2016

A: Moderately hazy, slightly transluscent when held up to bright light. Sits in the glass just a gorgeous, vibrant, glowing light orange / gold. Soft white head isn't too thick and fades relatively quickly.
S: Strong notes of pineapple, mango, and ripe, almost overripe stone fruit. Hints of citrus, but the sweet, juicy tropical fruit really overwhelms everything else. Pretty much no dankness or malt presence to be found on the nose. Aroma doesn’t pop out of the glass as much as that of some of the NE-style IPAs, but it’s close to the most appealing and enticing I’ve experienced.
T: Huge super juicy pineapple and peach up front, complemented perfectly by a mid-mouth appearance of sweet, bready malt. A welcome piney dankness—more minty and brightly herbal than oniony—hits on the finish, but it doesn’t overwhelm the aftertaste, instead complementing the tropical fruitiness to achieve a harmoniously balanced finish.
M: Leaning on the full side of medium, definitely deserving of the ‘creamy’ descriptor. It’s difficult to evaluate the feel of IPAs after drinking a bunch of Tree House beers, but Dinner holds its own. What’s so crazy about this particular beer is the fusion of such a rich and almost full mouthfeel with an assertive piney bitterness. 
O: So MBC describes this as an "east coast take on a west coast style," and I can definitely see where they're coming from. Fundamentally, Dinner is a juicy, NE-style fruit bomb. The aroma fires out pure tropical fruit notes unlike almost any other beer I've had. The taste is where the west coast style really comes in. The sweet malt backbone--while noticeable--takes a backseat to an array of hop flavors, which bring notes that both follow the nose--pineapple, peach, mango--and depart from it--pine, earth, and light resin. Overall, Dinner exemplifies extraordinary balance. While it doesn't have the most pungent nose or the most tropical flavor, it seems to bring with it a little bit of everything--in a way such that nothing clashes. It's a wonderfully unique DIPA, one that I'm thankful to have had the pleasure to try.
ALSO! The aromas/flavors came out so much more as it warmed. Seriously, this is one of those IPAs that I'd HIGHLY recommend you let sit out of the fridge for 20-30 minutes before opening. 2,341 charactersavas, Aug 26, 2016

Flavors are bold and big on the forward tongue, heavy on bitter hops characteristics of pine pitch/resin, dried grass, and pepper spice, followed by a smooth and juicy blend of orange, grapefruit, and a mild tropical fruit blend. Perfectly balanced on a smooth, chewy body. The aftertaste is extremely hop heavy, with a lingering bitterness and a blend of grassy and piney notes, but also with a solid astringency and boozy characteristic, too.

Dinner is the best non-haze-bomb non-juice-bomb DIPA I've had.  While I really like them, the hazy juicy northeastern IPA bombs are not for everybody ... Dinner is a DIPA that can be appreciated and admired by all DIPA drinkers.  Without getting into the exact rating of this beer relative to others, it definitely belongs near the top of any list.  Glad I tried it, and will always welcome another one.  Look is light orange with moderate cloudiness, and fluffy white head that lasts through a good deal of the beer.  The nose produces pineapple, mango, and general tropical fruit.  Taste is fruity, moderately hoppy with moderate carbonation, and a nice full and smooth mouth feel. 762 charactersedthehead, Jul 14, 2016

Dinner displays a finger of white caviar on top, which is quite readily rejuvenated.
Pliny was my initial thought at first sniff. However, this is a bit more pungent and dank. Super dank and tropical at the same time. Mango, papaya, cannabis, lemon drop. Needless to say this is a super hoppy beer. There are also some faint aromas of nuts, a distant fire in a cedar forest, and poblano pepper.
On the palate, spicy, peppery pine is accompanied by bright apricot and tangerine. Certain aspects of the flavor remind us of the time we tried a concentrated dose of the green hop residue left at the bottom of a DDH Trillium bottle, yet, it's not actually bitter, and that makes no sense and is absolutely wonderful!
Dinner seems extra carbonated, yet soft and fluffy, yet leaving a bit of a sting on the roof of the mouth. Dinner is exceptionally smooth, drinkable, and not harsh at all for a DIPA. 1,132 charactersSabtos, Jul 13, 2016

Awesome nose -- mix of pine, orange, pineapple with a hint of funk that really works very nicely together. There is a ton going on with the taste -- pine, pineapple, with a strong (but not overwhelming) bitter hop finish. Nice smooth mouth feel. This is without a doubt a world-class DIPA - certainly one of the best I have had. I would stand in line in the cold for a case.
Props again to Luchboxhead for sending one of these south of the Mason-Dixon -- may beer karma smile on you all year. 518 characters11-52_4hops, Jul 10, 2016

No lasting head. Moderate lacing. Immediate tropical fruit smell with some real dankness shining through. Similar flavors. Could drink this one all day if there wasn't a two case limit. Feel is perfect. Somehow light while packing oh so much flavor. Bottom line: you should drink this beer. 395 charactersLappleby24, Jul 09, 2016

4.49/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5I'm a little surprised by this beer, and not in a good way necessarily. It pours beautifully with a slightly hazy body that has a brassy orange glow. It draws a full, creamy white head that settles into a foamy sheet they leaves generous lacing. The aroma is very piney but with some citrus and tropical notes I even get a little bit of licorice. It's definitely big and complex but doesn't hit the notes I like. The taste truly follows the smell--even the hints of licorice. Again not my jam per se, but I totally get why people gush for this beer. The feel is a bit off for me. I love how there is a touch of sweetness that gets smoothed out by dryness, but I do think it's a touch too bitter. While it's not boozy, it's also not crushable, but it shouldn't be. Overall I think this is truly a world-class beer, it's just not really in my personal wheelhouse. I'm very glad I got to try it and I would definitely drink a lot more, but I don't think I'll be jumping in one of those epic lines anytime soon. 1,007 charactersCayseyW, Jul 09, 2016

Look - bright hazy orange, some clarity, thin white head and minimal lacing
Smell - mango, pineapple, grapefruit, piney, heavy tropical citrus bomb!
Taste - papaya, mango, pineapple, incredible balance of bitterness and fruity hoppiness
Feel - mouth coating with an amazing bitter aftertaste.  Crushable and no booziness at all
Overall - Best in class.  Re-confirms itself as my favorite IPA after trying this for the first time in 2015.  Incredibly complex, balanced, bitter, and deep.  Amazing this keeps itself highly touted as the original east coast IPA style with all the new juicy hazy bombs popping up everywhere.  This still wins, albeit with the gap closing.

L: 2F+ head with some lacing and a residual ring. Beer is a slightly hazy golden-bronze color.
S: Just beautiful in your face citrus juicebomb: grapefruit, orange, tangerine, lemon and lime rinds, maybe a hint of tropical pineapple as well. Light biscuit malts and some piney funk.
T: A perfectly proportioned juicebomb. Lots of grapefruit and orange, with supplementary tangerine, lemon/lime and pineapple. On the money between bitter and sweet. Light cracker malt for backbone. Progresses to a dank piney finish that is just the perfect amount of sticky and bitter and slowly dries.
F: Light to medium bodied, light to medium carbonation. Insanely perfect construction and balance, beautiful taste progression and good lingering piney finish to dryness. First 5 I have ever awarded for mouthfeel.
O: Well, it was worth the wait (honestly, the line atmosphere was great and the hours flew by). I gave half of my bottles away, but that means I have 5 more of this perfection to enjoy in the coming weeks (you don't want to let any Maine Beer Company IPA sit for very long; I have found them very fragile). 1,284 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jun 28, 2016

It has a nice, slightly cloudy, copper color.  Flavor balance is outstanding for a DIPA -- the hops are strong but do not mask the hints of citrus or malt/sweetness.  Easily my favorite double IPA.  I like it more than other top ranked doubles, probably because they have managed to not mask the more subtle flavors in the brew. 425 charactersExcalibur33, Jun 23, 2016

Dinner gets 5's across the board b/c it deserves it.   The hop profile is ridiculous, creating one the most appealing aromas of any beer I've ever opened.   The malt backbone perfectly compliments the hop additions (even after dry-hopping) which makes Dinner wicked smooth, bub!  Great citrus taste w/ a smooth (almost creamy to me) mouth feel.  There's a reason this beer sells out in hours every few months.  Fantastic! 502 charactersMattyTibbs, Jun 21, 2016

Dinner is a great beer, great...and thats that. Top 10? Eh, not so much, but then again KJ and PtY are 4 and 5 which is a stretch too. Top 25? Looking at 25-50, again a maybe at best. The hype and availability keep the ratings high, I get it. 
Appears mildly hazy, beautiful color. Smell is slightly earthy with abundant tropical notes and some phenolic/alcohol note present. Taste is a bit more thin than I'd had expected with a finish that drops off more abruptly than anticipated. Again, this is all precluded by the crazy hype (and large trade sent to acquire a few coveted bottles). The balance is superb and that is the high point. 
Really an awesome beer but perhaps one of the more over-hyped that I've had the pleasure of drinking. 
All being said I love MBC and all they stand for. I'll buy their products all day long and support their business whenever given the chance...aside from waiting in the cold for 12 hours for Dinner. 981 charactersMS22, May 04, 2016

You can smell this thing from 6 feet away. No exageration. One of, if not the best aromas I have encountered. A fruit explosion. Mango, orange, pineapple, peaches, melon, papaya. All of it is a bit pungent too. Nice amount of funky yeast in there. 
The flavors initially follow suit against a light biscuit malt background, but there is something that shows up at the very last second in the aftertaste and really brings it down. I sat for an hour trying to think of how to describe it and couldn't come up with an explanation. 
I also found it to be a bit too dry, but otherwise it was excellent. 
More than halfway through this I thought it was going to be the a damn near perfect beer and possibly the best dipa I have had, but it fell off for me. Still a phenomenal beer. 845 charactersWesMantooth, Apr 20, 2016

Appearance:  A two finger head was poured that reduced to a puffy layer.  It is a slightly hazy yellow orange hue with good clarity and vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.  Spotty lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Lemon, tropical, stone fruit, tangerine, herbal, spicy, pungent hops followed by wheaty, bready, biscuity, and caramel malts. 
Taste:  Everything above intertwined together.  Delicious, lasting hop flavor, balanced, a little dry, slightly chewy, and light tingly bitterness. 
Mouthfeel:  Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, a bit dry, light tingly bitterness, slight chewiness, and very tasty.
Overall:  The hype is true and happy to have finally enjoyed this beer.  I look forward to the next bottle in my fridge and any future release.  Well worth it. 861 charactersFlounder57, Apr 15, 2016

Looks like a copper to orange semi-cloudy glass of pretty. Sizable foamy head with decent lacing.
Smells like citrus - pineapple, oranges, mango, and a good amount of hops.  Amazing nose.  You can smell it from a foot away.
Taste is amazing. Perfectly balanced, hops and an explosion of citrus.  By far Maine's best beer.
Mouth feel is perfect.  Smooth with a great finish.
Overall well worth the wait. Never thought I would get this beer not on draft.  A superbly balanced brew with so many tropical and hoppy notes.  Beautifully made.  Love it. 646 charactersJay_P22, Apr 04, 2016
3.69/5  rDev -20.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5card #311 an the 3/26 release. Worth the wait? Yes, but just once to have done it. Lives up to the hype? No.
The beer itself is beautiful. Wonderful aroma on the nose and an equally pleasant taste. However the flavor is that of an average high-end DIPA. Unimpressive and standard compared to other big named brews these days. Is it better than anything I can get at local bar (save those serving Trillium)? Yes.
I was thoroughly disappointed when I poured and tasted my first bottle. I thought, "This is what all the hype was about???" But I digress. A very, very good DIPA. But definitely doesn't come close to any of the Tree House big guns or any of the Trillium DDH lineup. Maybe I'm just spoiled for hyped beer living in Boston.
Obviously all opinion, but this beer is easily replaceable and frankly not all that deserving of a spot in the top  10 here. Maybe top 50... 877 charactersTblaisdell, Apr 04, 2016

It is turbid, medium tan wood floor color. Leaves substantial lacing around the glass. The hops are kept in a delicate balance coming front and center first, then hides with a sweeter, juicy clean middle, and then the grapefruit hop bitterness sustains even after you have finished. Layered and complex, but the crispness does not hide the alcohol as well as Tree House. I have no idea how this compares to previous batches, but Dinner is best served fresh.

Smell: Dank, pine up front, grapefruit, orange, papaya, stone fruits, with a nice, sweet smelling malt backbone. 
Taste: Holy wow! Tastes like liquid hop juice! Super resinous and dank with a very pronounced citrus flavor with stone fruits appearing mid-sip, ending with a residual sweetness from the malts. 
Feel: Super smooth and soft drinking. I could drink this all day everyday if it wasn't limited. 
Overall: This is everything that I look for in an IPA and totally understand the hype on this one! It's the best IPA I've ever had and I plan on chasing this whenever it's released. 743 charactersTHSmusicman, Mar 27, 2016

Appearance: bright, bright yellow-orange, with a thick, white head atop. Hazy body, but is less so than some of its close neighbors (Bissell, Foundation). Leaves tons of lacing rings on the glass as the beer is sipped.
Aroma: bright grapefruit, lots of bitter pine....the hops are strong with this one. I got some kind of soapy, cilantro-esque aroma as well, which I surmise must be the mosaic mixed with some of the other hops.
Taste: lovely. Extremely hop-forward, as is the rage with New England IPAs. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, and citrus rind. Again, I also got some of that herbal, fresh flavor, like a cilantro. I got little to no malt character, perhaps a touch of bread on the base.
Feel: medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation. Leaves a sticky, piney bitterness on the palate.
Overall: a fantastic double IPA, and a clear standard bearer of the region's distinct style. Seek this beer out for sure. 962 charactersTheElectricOne, Feb 13, 2016

A strong brew, one everyone should have on their short list of must have IPAs. 243 charactersajcuster89, Feb 12, 2016

4.55/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Very unique. It has a really strong aroma of sweet tropical fruit, grain, and dank hops. The taste is almost like a pineapple pastry. It has a delightful soft bread flavor along with the tropical fruit, and hos with notes of honey and basil. The mouth feel is light, smooth, and very drinkable for 8.2%. If the fruit came through on the flavor a little more, this would be one of the best DIPAs I've had, but this bottle is almost 6 weeks old so I'll have to try a fresher bottle at some point. 494 charactersdanh53, Jan 31, 2016

To me, this is very hop forward with minimal malt backbone. Lots of Falconers and Citra hops make this citrusy and dry. Poors light clear yellow with very little head, smell is citrus, mouthfeel is thin, taste is citrus maybe dank, dry finish. Very interesting, wish this wasn't the only bottle I had. 410 charactersJunkforadam, Jan 11, 2016

Simply stated one of, if not THE best double IPA I've tried. Bursting with tropical fruit with enough sticky pine to remind you this has some SERIOUS hops packed into it. Not many beers I've traded for are "line worthy" or live up to the hype. This one does. 310 charactersKSOZE, Dec 30, 2015
4.81/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Look: deep yellow, almost Amber. Slight haze; transparent on the edges but not in the center. Decent head that settled with very small bubbles.
Smell: strong and rich citrus; honeydew. Fairly piney.
Taste: such a burst of flavors. More of what I think is honeydew. Pretty sweet but also has a subtle bitterness.
Feel: little bitter bite on the tip of the tongue but very smooth throughout. Practically leaves my mouth watering with those rich flavors.
Overall: this is pretty much perfect for a dipa. Perhaps flavor would be a 5 if I had rated this two weeks ago (freshest possible) but I don't think it has given off much since then. 634 charactersdhitchcox, Dec 30, 2015

4.66/5  rDev 0%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle dated 12/19/15. Enjoyed in a snifter on 12/27/15.
A: Orange hue, white foamy head upon conclusion of the pour. As I'm drinking, great lacing on the side of the glass.
S: Nose is muted at first as I just took the bottle out of a 38 degree fridge. As the beer warms, first I get a lot of pine, then more of the tropical fruits...mango, pineapple, some stonefruit.
T: Reisny pine gives way to the fruitiness of the hops. Along with the tropical fruits, I'm picking up green apple, peach. The hops are perfectly balanced by the biscuit malt sweetness on the backend.
M: One of the better mouthfeels in an IPA that I've ever experienced. Medium carbonation. Goes down way too smooth.
O: I've continuously been underwhelmed by MBC (except you, Another One!), but I have to admit...Dinner lives up to the hype. Rated highly for good reason. Seek this one out. 864 charactersarusso13, Dec 27, 2015

4.33/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Straw golden brew, with nice head and retention. Slightly hazy.
Super hoppy aroma: slightly catty, dank, tropical, pineapple, grapefruit, pale grains.
Flavor follows: grainy, piney, very dank (especially on the back end), very bitter.
Bitter, slightly puckering, lively.
Is this a well made beer? Of course. Does it live up to the hype? Not really. I can definitely see the appeal, as dank beers are very much in vogue. 423 charactersRoguer, Dec 26, 2015

Nice citrus peel nose.  Taste is a near perfect balance of sweet n bitter.  Light cracker malt with dank citrus, pine and floral hops.  The bitterness is soft and lingers just the right amount.  Semi dry finish.  Full soft creamy mouthfeel.  I see what the hype is about.  Not a juice bomb, not a hop bomb, just pure balanced delish. World class IPA. 458 charactersNolaHopHead, Dec 26, 2015

When I tried this with clean pallet, I realized this is truly an outstanding beer.  Look: Pours a orange yellow color with minimal head.  Smell was orange and grapefruit and some bread.  Taste was understated and complex.  Smooth flavors blending together with Orange giving way to a slight grapefruit pucker.  Fell is excellent, but a bit syrupy.  overall one of the best. 492 charactersgonzo000, Dec 26, 2015

Very interesting the whole way through. When they were done we switched to sip of sunshine, and it tasted one dimensional and flat. Dinner is as good as advertised.

Loads of citrus, tropical fruit, pine. moment it touches the tongue and palate, you get this amazing balance of waves of hop forward tangerine, green mango, pineapple and then the hop bitterness. long lasting dry finish. 
Try this: put the cap back on the empty bottle and smell it next day (or for a week) and it continues to smell great, unlike most empty bottles. 460 charactersdee4maine, Dec 20, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Not even going to bother going into the categories, simply put this beer is on another plane of existence.  Pours a light golden, hazy color.  Smell... Good God, the smell... Hoppy, piney, fruity, dank.  Taste is everything you want in a DIPA, literally everything, and is the reason why this beer is a perfect 5.  I have always felt Maine Beer Co. excelled at producing a perfectly balanced IPA, and with the amount of flavors packed into this beer it is a minor miracle it still manages to stay perfectly balanced between every flavor, big or small, that it contains in it's luscious 16.9 fluid oz.    If I haven't made it clear enough already, seek this beer out, buy it if you're in the are (of the brewery that is) and you will not be disappointed. 753 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Nov 20, 2015

I love the nose, that's for sure. Fresh grapefruit meets canteloupe. 
Tastes more like a bitter, resinous, tart and juicy grapefruit with light mango and melon. 
So light and delicate-drinking but it packs a bitter wallop.
I see the appeal here. A gentle hand and subtlety are driving forces here with great success. 359 charactersONovoMexicano, Nov 13, 2015

A= Cloudy golden color, hazy but lets light through.  Thick foamy pure white head that is slow to dissipate.  Tons of sticky lacing clings to the glass with each sip.  Very nice looking beer.
S= Instantly noticeable big burst of tropical and citrus aroma, full and tempting.  This is followed by a bit of pine with a back end of dank resinous hop aroma.
T= Definitely follows the nose, big tropical burst up front is the first thing to hit the taste buds.  Deep full hop flavor is resinous, earthy, crisp and refreshing at the same time.  Hard to drink slowly, but also hard not to savor.
M= Medium body with a bit lighter than moderate carbonation.
O= I am surprised that this met my expectations.  Not because I thought the scarceness would increase my perception, and I typically do like all MBC brews, but it is really hard to meet really high expectations in the beer world.  The aroma and flavor are top notch, hard to pick a DIPA I would prefer.  The combination of subtlety and in your face hop aroma and flavor meets a level close to perfection. 1,104 charactersjhavs, Nov 10, 2015

4.92/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Purchase at the release on 10/24. Thought I already reviewed this but I guess it didn't post, so this is based on half a dozen bottles consumed since. I would so very happily drink this beer and no others for the rest of my life.  
Appearance - no matter how I pour this, it somehow produces the same perfect two finger head every time and is one of the best looking beers.
Aroma - smell hits you the second you pop the cap and you get all the hoppy citrus and tropical fruit notes that you want out of a great IPA.  Still makes me shake my head and mutter each time I smell it.
Taste - unlike many IPAs these days that have a great nose, this 100% delivers on the nose with the same exact flavors and the same intensity of flavor.  So many times I'll be let down that the taste isn't nearly as potent and strong as you'd expect from a great smelling DIPA.
Mouthfeel  - medium bodied mouthfeel with just the right amount of malt backbone and bitterness.  Everything is pretty perfectly in balance, at least as far as my preferences go and what I want out of the style. 
Overall - This is an incredible DIPA and an incredible overall beer, and is absolutely worth the hype.  People will often inflate a beer's ratings because of how hard it was to obtain.  That is 100% not what's going on with this beer.  I gave two of my bottles to guys I trade with and both were similarly blown away, and it took zero effort for them to get it.  This is truly one of the best beers I've had and I've had a lot of really amazing beers.  Deserves the hype and its ranking as one of the top 10 beers in the world.  I just wish I could get it more often. 1,642 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Nov 09, 2015

4.51/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Hot on the heels of Lunch IPA, the Main Beer Company sees potential. Backed with the knowledge of what "imperializing" can do to hops, they get back to the drawing board and devise an ale that's sure to become the equivalent of catnip for hop-heads.
Deep within its deep and cloudy goldenrod prominence, and underneath its creamy and lacy foam cap, the ale calders from below with a deep and dank citrusy perfume that's tropical and teeth-churningly tantalizing from its scent alone. But once the highly seductive elixir touches the tongue- magic begins to happen- The seemingly drippy fructose flavors of honey and caramel wrap around the tongue and begin to massage it with its powdered sugar and arid candied taste.
But dissolving swiftly much like cotton candy, the hops judiciously scare the malts away in order to bring a militant hop tilt to the fold. Vibrant ruby red grapefruit, branch-ripe tangerine and candied lemon link up with a tropical sense of pineapple, mango, passionfruit and apricot for a medley that's straight out of hawaiian punch and a sherbet medley. Yet as IPA does, all those suculences round smoothly into a soft and surly bitterness that's redolent of sweet pine, fresh-cut grass, muddled chive and cannabis oils.
And with all that, the ale resonates moderate and medium on the palate. Its lush and creamy textures are countered by hop and alcohol dryness with mild ethanol spice and a suave bittering that's gentle on the gullet. But make no mistake about it- as the ale finishes resinous and supported with a malty exoskeleton, the complexity and strength of this beer is no joke. 1,615 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 06, 2015

S - bright citrus moving into fresh pine. Fills the nostrils and lungs, imparting aromatics everywhere possible. Dank, tropical fruits. 
T - pineapple. Pine. Huge juice bomb. Fruity and earthy. Elegant and primitive. Invokes oddly nostalgic feelings. Balance is otherworldly. Every aspect complements itself.
F - delicate and flowery. Flows gracefully throughout the mouth, dancing lightly on the tongue before seeping deeply into my body. Yum.

S: Just a deep, dank mix of resinous hops and tropical fruit. Mango, pineapple and passionfruit with some pine in the back. Maybe a bit of tangerine in there as well. This smells absolutely fantastic.
T: I have yet to have anything approaching a bad beer from these guys and this is easily the best I've had. Taste brings an assault of grassy and piney hop resin along with a good amount of tropical fruit. Passion fruit and mango come in the most here, but they're very restrained and the beer never really comes close to being sweet. Finish is long, resinous and just scrapes your tongue with pine resin and baby aspirin. Great mouthfeel as well. There's just nothing in here that I don't love. 861 charactersnotchucknorris, Nov 05, 2015

Two bottles, approximately a week apart. The first bottle was 6 days old at time of consumption. The first bottle was close to perfect, while the second was merely outstanding. 
Yellow body, mild haze, thick white cap. Looks like my kind of IPA. Glorious aroma. Fruity, hoppy, citrusy, dank, loveliness. Hop forward with minimal malt character. A bouquet of flowery hops and tangy, juicy citrus. Medium bodied with just the slightest hint of alcohol warmth in the finish. Outstanding. 537 charactersHuhzubendah, Oct 31, 2015

L- Pours a hazy tangerine color with thick, fluffy white head.
S- Citrus. Big time. Fantastic nose as expected.
T- Fruity. Resinous. Starts out some tame but explodes mid palette with juicy hops. Finished the same but it has a nice malt backbone (which I prefer) that balances it out nicely.
M- This may actually be my favorite aspect. It's somewhat full for the style. Juicy yet crisp. Kind of a conflict in terms but it really works.
O- Typically I'm not a huge IIPA fan as often times I find the hops to be just too overwhelming. But this does s good job of balancing the juicy, sweet, bitter,and resinous aspects in a great little package. It lives up to the billing. 690 charactersZaximus, Oct 30, 2015

Aroma is big sweet citrus. Taste is citrusy, but more bitter pine with a biscuity undertone. Mouthfeel is perfect, and leaves the tastebuds buzzing after each swallow. Finish is bitter and dry, with a faint lingering sweetness. Absolutely amazing. 365 charactersPVMT, Oct 27, 2015

I loved this beer the last time I had it, but now, after having it again from a different batch I think it is safe for me to say that this is hands down the best DIPA I have ever had. The aroma is absolutely insane. I could smell this all day without drinking it and be content. The taste lives up to the aroma too, which in many DIPA's I find not to be true. Perfect beer. Seek out, it is worth it! 463 charactersJNbeerded, Oct 25, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5Bottled this morning (10/24/15) and hauled all the way back to Philly.
A beautiful orange/golden that is more cloudy and opaque at the core than the edges.  Perfect lacing from a fluffy white head.
Nose is nothing but tropical fruit and hops.  Oranges, tangerines, pineapple, mango, and plum.  An underlying sweet malt is faintly present.
The taste is overwhelming.  All of the fruit from the nose come through with full force.  Primarily the mango, pineapple, and orange.  A crisp biscuit malt combines wonderfully with the hops on the back end.  A hoppy aftertaste lingers for an eternity.  I could still taste this after 5 minutes of sitting here without taking a sip.
Medium body, mid-to-high carbonation, yet surprisingly soft.  Weakest aspect of the beer, but still great.
Overall, this is might be the most balanced beer that I've ever had.  Everything works in perfect harmony.  It's like being crushed to death by tropical fruit and hops.  I expected to be let down, to be perfectly honest, but I can't fault this beer.   I'll gladly stand in line a 4 AM in 35 degree weather for this over and over, I'm just hoping my girlfriend will be a lovely mule for me again. 1,179 charactersepyon396, Oct 25, 2015
4.83/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours an ever so slightly cloudy bright golden orange color with a large white head. Leaves a beautiful amount of lacing around the glass as the head dissipates. 
The aroma is a tropical citrus bomb. No other way to put it. I get notes of mango, orange, and tangerine, followed by the faintest hint of sweet, doughy malt. Very sweet aroma but not at all cloying or overpowering. 
The taste follows the nose nicely, with the tropical notes hitting pretty hard while some grassy pine and a  nice malt character hold it all together. Along with the strong mango notes, I get quite a bit of pineapple here as well. Just an amazing, juicy flavor that is never too strong in any one regard. Perfect. 
The feel is medium bodied with a ton of carbonation and almost no alcohol to be found. Finishes on a dry and slightly bitter note. 
Overall, wow. Absolutely blown away by this beer. The aroma is one I could bury my nose in all day long, and the flavor is so fantastic and well balanced. There is not a single glaring flaw in this beer. Everything is perfect the way it is. Could this point of view be based on hype? Or perhaps the idea that I spent so long trying to obtain it that I am simply justifying all that time and waiting by overrating the beer? These things are possible, and I won't ever be able to answer them. However from where I am standing, this is one of the best IPA's, DIPA's, hoppy beers, etc... that I have ever had. Absolutely fantastic. 1,458 charactersScaryEd, Oct 25, 2015

This beer in my opinion is what Pliny is supposed to taste like. This beer has tons of hop and fruit aroma, lots of pine as well. This is in my top 5 for DIPA's and its something everyone who likes beers should drink. 429 charactersvicinandp, Sep 03, 2015

Man was I wrong, this is a hopbomb! 
It is so light tasting for the amount of hoppiness this beer has in it. The nose is heavenly, fruit scents with tiniest hint of pine dominated by hop characteristics. The taste is a blend of citrus and a slight bitterness that ties the entire beer together.
Awesome brew. 400 charactersSuds_With_Buds, Aug 18, 2015

Deep tropical hop flavor balanced to absolute perfection with a clean, crisp malt profile with just a hint of sweetness. I've had beers from TH and Trillium that pack a bigger hop character but none are in suhc perfect harmony with everything else present in the beer.
The hype is real, deserves every accolade it gets. 455 charactersVetsPackage, Jul 28, 2015

4.81/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Wow! The first east coast DIPA I've had that truly blew me away. 
Appearance - pours a orange/golden color with a light fluffy head. Great carbonation and slight legs.
Aroma - I could instantly smell the Citra hops in this and thats what bkew me away. Tropical and mango notes abound. My mouth instantly watered.
Taste/Mouthfeel - the nose was confirmed that this is an awesomely awesome citrus/tropical bomb! Medium mouthfeel and no hint of bitterness anywhere, just juicy delicious tropical notes. 
Overall - I'm by no means a hophead and don't normally seek them out in trades, but after having this I sure am glad I did! I fully expected this to be just like all the other east coast malt bomb IPAs I've had, but I was pleasantly surprised! KRBC Citra is my all time favorite DIPA, and this is the first and only beer that can come close. Well done! 857 charactersbnelson997, Jul 22, 2015

Taste is beyond definition, very clean tasting, easy drinkin that is not overly bitter or pine-y. Virtually no alcohol taste. Feel is light, crisp and dry. Outstanding like all of MBC's beers. One worth getting but you will wish you had a constant suply. 374 characterspjkelley82, Jul 20, 2015

Taste: Much like the smell, it was extremely citrusy and fruity.  Not overly bitter.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, good carbonation, and very little alcohol coming through.  Goes down so easy.
Overall: Easily one of the best DIPAs (or beers for that matter) that I have ever had.  Would love to try one really fresh one day. 539 characterstmryan21, Jul 13, 2015

a - cloudy orange yellow w a thin foamy ipa head...sheets of lace.
s - oh yum. tropical fruit bouquet. wish I had some fresh lunch to compare, but this is just as good as my memory treks me.
t/m/o - first off, SUPER easy drinking and refreshing with a very tasteful hop profile that sings of tropical ripe fruit and citrus. don't have lunch to compare but very much comes across like the double lunch. quality beverage, hope to have thus again and again and...! 570 characterscosmicevan, Jun 27, 2015

Nose is candied tropical fruits. Amazing! 
Flavor is tart, sweet, quenching. A taste explosion of tropical fruity hops (Mango, Pineapple, Papaya, plus Grapefruit) with a malt backbone that is Pliny-like in it's unobtrusiveness. Truly a pleasure to sip this one.
Mouthfeel is sticky and stripping. Tart on the palate with a lingering chalkiness from the hop resins.
Overall, top notch. A wonderful DIPA, and one that I will drive to Maine to seek out in the future. Thanks to Krishna for the trade! 560 charactersghostwalker, Jun 26, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.7516.9 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.
Appearance: Pours a hazy, glowing orange with a huge white head that shows good retention. Some dotty lacing is observable. Lots of carbonation going on in there. Okay, let's see if this is the real deal ...
Aroma: Huge, strong, very attractive nose. Lots of tropical fruit. Kind of smells like apricots and candy. Also peach, mango. Pine is there. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever smelled.
Taste: Wow. The taste fulfills the nose. Bursting with big tropical fruit flavors. The mango comes forward a bit as it warms. Peach, apricot still there. That pine note is still there. Little bit of sap. Impressively dry despite the sugarish aroma in the nose. Everything you've heard about this beer is true.
Mouthfeel: Remarkably smooth. Not abrasive at all despite super hops and pretty high alcohol by volume. Alcohol, by the way, is deep in the background. Deceptively, almost dangerously, drinkable.
Overall: A powerhouse. Everything is true. Terrific beer. 1,006 charactersillpass78, Jun 24, 2015

4.72/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a recently purchased bottle.
Big head with small bubbles, similar to Lunch.  Light color, and hazy.
Smells of tropical fruits, especially mango.  Some pine.  Citrus rinds.
Tastes similar to the smell, but with specifically more orange.  Great balance of sweet and bitter.  With some bottles I get onion and dank flavors, other times it's just tropical.  I think this isn't an actual difference between the bottles, but more my palate or the temperature of the beer or something like that.  Finishes dry.
Medium carbonation.  It feels creamy at first but then slides down quickly, leaving very little oily hoppiness on the palate compared to some other doubles.
This is really great, and totally different from Lunch, which I also love.  It's more like a stronger Beer I.
Update: In a side-by-side comparison of this with Heady, I think this is better.  For sure it has a stronger smell with more passion fruit and dank.  And it's less bitter.  Whether that's what you prefer will vary from person to person.  To Heady's credit, its finish lasts longer. 1,063 characterscfalls, Jun 21, 2015

Light creamy fizzy head, little lacing, hazy golden tan color. 
Nose is crazy, tons and tons of fresh hops, tons of citra and galaxy, fresh citrus everywhere, orange juice, pith, orange cream, little mango and tropical notes, juicy as Hell, touch of dank resin, little peach and skin. 
Taste brings more fresh hops, tons of citrus, orange cream, and orange juice, fresh orange juice with mild grapefruit pith, little peel, touch tropical mango notes, little peach as well, skin, and touch of resin. Fleshy orange with mild creamy malt. Mild bitterness and nice lingering pith. 
Mouth is med bod, nice creamy, decent carb. 
Overall really good, lives up to the hype, so well done, great hops executed well with nice malt profile, but that being said, there are def other great and better IPAs around this area. 885 charactersjlindros, May 09, 2015

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a hazy golden hue that fades to leave nice lacing, good thin blanket. 
S - Aromas of mango, light pineapple, musty hops, tropical notes, light malts. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose, grassy tropical notes, musty hops, nice pineapple, mango, nice light malts. 
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, nice and clean no real booze. 
O - Overall this beer was really tasty, good hop profile. Can understand why people go nuts for this.

A-  beautiful light, fuzzy yellow with a touch of orange.  Nice one finger frothy head.  Medium carbonation.
S- Amazing and everything I want in an IPA.  Tons of fresh juicy fruits.  Pineapple, mango, peach, they're all there.  
T-  some IPAs don't live up to the hype or their nose, Dinner does for both.  Super fresh and quaffable.
M- medium to light, just perfect.
O- I can't find a thing wrong with Dinner.  It's a top notch IPA and one if my all time favorites.  I would drink this every time if I could. 535 charactersEveningCordial, May 06, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance:  Pours a hazy goldenstraw capped by an inch or so of foam; dribs and drabs of lacing hang around
Smell:  Very juicy, with citrus pith, passion fruit and orange tones
Taste:  While the flavor profile is dominated by the hops, there is a subtle malt profile that brings a soda bread element to the table; the hops subsume the malt, with dankness - orange, passion fruit, pith and a little onion on the finish
Mouthfeel:  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  Hype builds on hype and while I like this beer a lot, I wouldn't put it head and shoulders above all the other juicy, hop forward, dank DIPAs out there

A - Pours a dark orange, tangerine color with a finger or so of bright white head.
S - Wow.  Fresh pineapple is huge in the aroma.  Juicy, tropical fruits.  Tangerines, mango, it smells like freshly juiced pineapple.  Little bit of grassiness, and slight dankness.
T - Incredible.  Huge pineapple up front.  Juicy. Underneath all that pineapple, there is mango, orange, a little bit of resinous pine.  Middle of the mouth, there is slight dankness, but the juicy pineapple comes back and balances this beer perfectly.
O - In the world of amazing Southern CA DIPAs, I can say that Dinner from Maine is the best one I've ever had.  This sets the standard for me as far as DIPAs go.  Amazing stuff. 763 charactersjow_42, May 01, 2015

Huge hop aroma. Pours a cloudy, hazy  orange color, sticky two finger head. Laces from start to finish.  Taste is just perfect, so smooth it doesn't feel like a double IPA. I think this is my favorite of all of the NE IPA big boys - it's one that I feel like has out done its hype. 394 charactersJwburns75, Apr 30, 2015

A.   Pours a mostly opaque amber color with a 2 finger fluffy white head. 
S.   Wow angels absolutely delicious.   Mango and citrus with some pine. Slightly floral.   Some cotton candy aroma.   Just smells amazing. 
T.   The taste is right there with the nose.  Mango,  citrus and pine.   I think the pine comes out a little more on the flavor.   Candy like sweetness from the malts.   Slight grassy aftertaste.   Not much bitterness.   It's very nice. 
M.   Pretty much right on for a DIPA.   5 out of 10 on body thickness.   Some decent carbonation but not too much.   Finishes very clean.   Not too heavy.   Close too perfect.

I put this right there with Bad Boy. Definitely in my top 3 favorite IPAs. Too bad the bottle is not a full 22 oz.

O: for all the hype, I expected much more. It's was underwhelming. If I had waited in line for 4-5 hrs, I'd be more than dissatisfied. 409 charactersDWBoca57, Apr 24, 2015

4.13/5  rDev -11.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This is a review of 7 bottles from the same case of beer. Bottom line was 4 bottles had great appearance but aroma and mouthfeel were light. Flavor profile: forward and middle were just ok before pulling a Houdini and completely disappearing on the back side. Totally disappointing especially because these were the first four bottles sampled. Score: 3.6. When the fifth bottle was sampled I expected more of the same but was in for a shock. This bottle had everything. Appearance, aroma, mouthfeel and flavor profile were excellent. This I believe is the Dinner that gets rave reviews. Score: 4.5. The remaining two bottles were good. Not as weak as the first four nor as strong as the fifth bottle. Score: 4.1. In my opinion there is a definite lack of consistency in this beer. 780 charactersMark_, Apr 22, 2015

Pours a sunny deep orange hazy body with a big frothy white head that reduces slowly, leaving chunky foam and lots of retention/lacing. Really nice looking. 
Big, potent aromas of juicy fruits, fresh citrus, pineapple, like a tropical heaven bursting into my nostrils.. mango, pineapple, passionfruit. Fresh hops straight from the package, raw, alpha acids that make my mouth water. Nearly perfect here. 
The tongue follows the nose with the addition of some piney/resinous notes.. lots of citrus and tropical fruits, followed by a piney/resinous bite then a light hop zing on the finish, no big hop bitterness on the finish which is nice, this ties into a nice easy drinking mouthfeel with medium carbonation and body. Beer burps are awesome.. which I usually don't comment on but these taste like straight hops. 
Overall a beautifully crafted DIPA, one of the freshest, most tropical I've ever smelled and the most balanced I've tasted. Excellent. 1,054 charactersgcamparone, Apr 21, 2015

4.74/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75This is the best big IPA I've had, and big IPAs are my favorite beers, and it's my first rating... so 4.75 is the highwater mark for now.
I've been drinking Dinner for a week. It is a remarkably smooth DIPA. Closest comparison I've had is Lagunitas Sucks, but Dinner is more robust. 
First had it on tap at MBC, and fell in love. Went back at next release and waited over four hours to buy a case. After two hours I was telling myself that it's not worth doing this again (there are other great IPAs). Two sips into the first bottle I was already planning for the next line at the next release. 594 charactersPip_Count_167, Apr 20, 2015

Felt it was slightly thin for a DIPA. A very good beer but not in the top echelon of DIPA's. 385 charactersDocrock, Apr 18, 2015

4.19/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Many thanks to Steve for providing the bottle!
Has a glowing orange color, with a soon collapsing, bubbly head.
Got an intense, fruity nose, with lots of juicy oranges, among herbs and glazed malts. The orange yields a glue like aspect, as well as prickly kiwi notes, with a resinous impact, blending well into the sweeter smells.
Taste is more herbaceous than the nose revealed, with a gentle influence of fresh cut grass, balanced by pine and wooden, slightly biscuity malts. On top of that settles the orange fruitiness, with lots of white peel being noteable, while an enjoyable hop bitterness becomes visible, getting easily balanced by the earthy malts and a lower, well fitting carbonation, which provides a very smooth mouthfeel. The present malt backbone gets joined by a slick, semi dry kiwi punch, among chunks of grapefruit during the finish, pulling the beer into a hoppier direction. Amazingly balanced, easy drinkable double IPA, with an ever evolving, gentle hop character. 992 charactersaleigator, Jan 10, 2015

4.88/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a dark peachy orange.
The aroma offers lots of peach, passion fruit, sweet mangoes, and pineapple. There is also a underlying kumquat and tangerine peel. Some rock candy sweetness. Very reminiscent of a sugary lollipop or candy.
On the flavor, up front is pink grapefruit, oranges, tangerine, citrus peel, it transitions to some mangoes and pineapple. There are some lacking parts on the palate, but it is still a clean hop bomb. It drinks under its ABV. An underlying note of grassiness offers bitterness and drying. There is a medium bitterness on the back end and a dank quality as well.
The mouthfeel is creamy at first, but then flies off the palate a bit. Not as chewing and creamy as some Hill Farmstead or Tree House brews.
By far Maine Beer's best beer and puts them on level with some of the top hoppy breweries, but this offering is one point below some of the elite.

A - Deep, opaque apricot body.  Off-white head with medium-to-fine bubbles, nice retention and ok lace.
S - Wow, fantastic nose.  Bright, crisp and fresh.  Cilantro, orange, grapefruit, honey, and soft rosemary. 
T - Loaded with fresh crisp celery, bitter grapefruit pith, and cilantro stems.  Biscuit, orange, and honey sweetness through the center.  Bitter greens, white bread, and mild cauliflower finish. 
M - Smooth and full bodied for the style.  Well balanced carbonation.
O - A stellar IPIA.  In the category of world-class IPIA's, Dinner's flavor profile is notably clean and crisp, lead by the incredibly fresh celery note that's relatively unique for the style.

A - Dark golden in color.  The beer is not clear, but certainly has good clarity.  Beer pours with a very minimal head that retreated nearly immediately.  Beautiful lacing on this one...reminiscent of that doily at your grandmother's house.
N - Instant floral hop explosion in your face.  Beautiful floral and citrus notes -- kind of like sniffing a bowl of fruit in a flowery meadow.  Very pronounced aromas of mandarin oranges and mangoes.
T - Great citrus up front...like I leaned in and took a bite out of that fruit bowl.  The hop flavors come through strong in the middle and the taste ends with a nice grapefruit-like bitterness.  The citrusy flavors linger and do not go away...simply delightful!
M - The beer is not thin by any means, but is fairly light for a DIPA.  There are no overbearing malt characteristics.  Very well balanced and extremely quaffable.
O - This is a fantastic DIPA that definitely lives up to the hype.  It's easy to lump it in with the other world class DIPA's from New England and it certainly is in the same class, but this beer is unique in its own right.  I wish I lived closer to ME and that I could get my hands on it all  the time! 1,301 charactersajz132, Dec 14, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +1.9%Look: Pours a beautiful bright orange, with thick white head. Nose: Dank, Citrus & Mango. Incredible nose on this beer. Taste: Tropical Fruit & Citrus, Dank Hops, bitter/Dry finish. Mouthfeel: Light, but creamy--coats the tongue--extremely pleasant.
Overall: One of the best D-IPAs I have ever had (and I've had a lot). I'd rank it in the same company as Lawson's sip of sunshine, Heady Topper, and a couple of Hill Farmstead IPAs.This beer is worth the effort to track down. Already looking forward to the #5th release in 2015. 529 charactersCofC07, Dec 12, 2014
4.52/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5look- color is a bright orange, pours two fingers of white head, head settles into thick spots of lacing.
Smell- Tropical fruits burst out immediately upon opening the beer. Tons and tons of mango, melon, pineapple, hints of citrus.
Taste- The heavy fruit presence is not as prominent in the taste as it is in the aroma, but its there. fruit notes upfront, very slight malt sweetness, hop funk in the finish.
Feel-light body, yet creamy upfront, dry in the finish. lots of contrast.
overall- a spectacular, satisfying DIPA 522 charactersSteveB24, Dec 12, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +1.9%Made the trip to Maine to wait in line for a case of Dinner (and Lunch).  Got in line at 6:20am and was #147.  Maine Beer Co did a great job with the release - very orderly, kept everybody informed about their chances to get the beer, and the brewery smelled incredible!  
Poured beer into a long-stemmed Hill Farmstead glass.  Nice light-golden, orange color.  Compared it to Lunch and it looked just slightly lighter in color. 
The nose is heavenly.  Mango, Peach, not as familiar a hop smell as other DIPAs I've had.  
The taste is almost as good as the smell.  Very smooth.  Almost a little under-carbonated.  A lot of DIPAs, like HT, leave my mouth really dry, craving water.  This one doesn't - nice, wet finish.  
So, so, so so, fresh.  This is definitely in the conversation with Heady, Abner, Double Sunshine, etc.  for best beer in New England. 858 charactersPawoto, Dec 08, 2014

S- Peaches, caramel, toffee, a little bit of damp grain, some citrus zest. A little bit of pine. Plenty powerful hoppiness for a 2 month old DIPA. [4]
F- Tastes fairly stone-fruity with citrus bitterness, backed up by a particularly thick sweet pale malt backbone evoking caramel, toffee, biscuits. Lots of flavours here, including the hops. It seems clear that the malt backbone is a bit stronger than intended, no surprise given that it's a bit on the older side. [4.5]
M- Medium bodied, soft, smooth and refreshing. Almost creamy. Something in that New England water. Perfect carbonation, very easy to drink. [4.25]
O- Very good for a 2 month-old DIPA, have to wonder what it's like off the bottling line. [4.25] 1,033 charactersStevedore, Oct 03, 2014

Lots of citrus, mainly grapefruit, and pine resin on the nose with hints of sweet malt and tropical fruit. Bitter on the palate with gobs of citrus hops, mostly grapefruit with a hint of orange zest. Pine resin on the finish. Medium bodied with good carbonation with a crisp, dry bitter finish. Overall an outstanding DIPA that can stand with the best of them!

Bottled:  07/31/14
Type:  500ml. Bottle
Glass:  Fiddlehead Weizen Glass
Pours a hazy, burnt orange in color w/ a 1 finger head that lingers producing light lacing on the glass.  Aromas of cat piss, fresh cut PVC pipe, clementine, lemon, pineapple, and pot.  The flavor started off w/ light clementine and pineapple and a touch of malt sweetness, transitioning to a blast of grapefruit and pine, finishing w/ a nice herbal hop tingle.  Medium bodied w/ adequate carbonation and middle of the road dryness.  I drank the balls off this one in a minute!  The smoothness and absence of bitterness make this one dangerous to endulge in for sure.
Overall, worthy of the hype and accolades, an awesome and unique animal.  This was one of the tougher reviews I have written in some time as this new school DIPA was a beer all it's own and different from mostly anything else I have sampled in the category.  The closest beer I can describe it to is Fiddlehead Mastermind kicked up a notch.  Anyway, the 3rd beer to beat out Heady in my book and only slightly trailing Double Sunshine and the mighty Sosus.  Great work Maine Brewing Co.! 1,145 charactersmikeyv35, Sep 06, 2014

This one will climb the charts. 760 charactersVTLocal420, Sep 04, 2014

My only gripe is that super fresh bottles of this beer smell...well, pretty ripe, like a locker room full of sweaty armpits. 
This is a world class beer, though I would suggest "aging" the beer for a week to let the nose mellow out before opening. 347 charactersrodmanfor3, Sep 02, 2014

4.61/5  rDev -1.1%Thanks to Wowcoolman for sharing this one at his tasting.
Bottled 7/31/14.
Pours a hazy golden-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with fantastic citrus and tropical forward hop qualities all around.
Serving type: bottle. 653 charactersUCLABrewN84, Aug 18, 2014
4.25/5  rDev -8.8%About 3 weeks old (sacrilege I know...)
Pours a slightly hazy amber with big fluffy white head that leaves nice lacing. Tropical mango and pineapple on the nose mixed with mild alcohol burn. Taste follows the nose to the T, but has a decent amount of malt backbone that I don't nessicarily need. Easy to drink with light booze heat. Nice. Much better than Lunch, but Not a beer I'll have to have every time it's released. 422 charactersSeanniek91, Aug 18, 2014

A: Pours a cloudy light orangish/pale color with two fingers of soapy, light sand colored head.  Large swaths of lacing and excellent retention. (5)
S: Gorgeous fresh citrus (tangerine, orange) and piney hops, some pineapple, a bit of dankness, with an austere light toffee, slightly sweetish malt backbone.  Hop-forward but with sufficient malt support. (4.75)
T: Taste follows the nose, finishing with a very mild bitterness and almost completely dry. (4.5)
M: Light body and medium carbonation, slightly creamy texture. (4.5)

T - Nice seedy/resinous bitters mix with pineapple and orange type hop flavors. Superbly clean citrusy bitter flavor, just the right touch of pine. Almost more seedy than piney. Finish is equal parts light/bitter, citrusy, seedy/resinous pine, and just sessionable light, easy drinking flavor profile. 5

Poured from the bottle into large tulip glasses, the beer is a nearly opaque orange-yellow (apricot?) with a thin tight white head. 
The aroma is just HUGE fruity hops - tropical fruit and citrus mainly, with a hint of resin and pine. 
Surprisingly, the first thing that hits the taste palette is grapefruit - I did not pick up grapefruit in the nose. This is followed up with grapefruit peel, mango, orange, passion fruit, and more tropical deliciousness, ending with pine, resin, dank (cannabis?) and then just the most beautifully balanced bitterness I've ever experienced in a beer. 
Full bodied, slightly dry, smooth and totally luscious. 
Overall, this is one of the best, perhaps the single best, beer I've ever tasted. 899 charactersFFreak, Aug 10, 2014

The head leaves sticky fat fluff of lacing when it rescinds. In body, the beer is a nearly opaque murk of tiny particulates and haze. On the nose is where this beer is king. From the moment you pop the bottle you know you are in for a tropical fruit bomb. Even from a foot away, my glass is oozing fruit salad scent across the nose, but when I get my nostrils nicely in the glass’s bulb, I’m met with decadent and complex hop aromas. Pine resin blends with pineapple, mango, soft melon, and fruity caramel. Alcohol does prickle at the edges of the nose, but only if you search for it, and as a whole the nose just comes off smelling like a hugely aromatic fruit salad with accents of pine. This has got one damn fine nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet up front, but with definite bitter balance that builds into the middle and finish of the beer wonderfully. Booze makes its presence known towards the finish of the sip, punching through some of the decadent hop notes while acidity is faintly present on the fringes of the tongue. In flavor the beer begins as pineapple juice, moving more towards pine with flashes of medicinal hops, bright grass, lemon citrus, and grapefruit juice. Slight alcohol and caramel hops enter in the middle of the sip, but the finish of the beer is straight ruby red grapefruit juice with just a hint of booze. The aftertaste is of piney/grapefruity hops. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to full bodied, with a middling carb that provides a healthy scrub to the tongue. Mouthfeel is crisp and effervescent, if a touch heavy towards the finish of the sip. Overall, this is a hell of a Double IPA. I’ve already heard it compared to the Headys and Plinys of the world (gasp…) but I think that was a forgone conclusion. MBC makes some damn fine hoppy beer and this is no exception. This beer strikes towards the top of the DIPA list for sure, and is a true work of art in terms of juicy, tropical fruit hops. I do have some quibbles with it, however, as I do with any beers. For starters, I think the booze could be a little better integrated, as it does add a bit too much heat towards the back of the sip. I also feel that the nose far outweighs the taste in terms of overall decadence and hop character, which can be argued as an attribute of DIPA’s, but since we are talking God-Tier DIPA’s I must say that others of this plateau have met that balance more so than Dinner. The nose is where Dinner is a winner, for sure, and she is a damn fine winner. Drink the beer fresh. Enjoy it. Wait in line for three hours if you want to. It’s a nice beer. 2,766 charactersMaxwell, Aug 08, 2014

A. Pours a hazy, brilliant orange. Half finger of puffy, soapy white head with very good persistence. Lacing is consistent, coating, and sticky.
S. Heavily tropical, candied oranges, pineapple, and tangerine explode on the nose. Lush, dank hops creep in on the back end and provide a bit of spice to the affair, but overall this has a luscious, tropical, gorgeous bouquet. Top marks.
T. Just as amazing as the nose, perhaps moreso. Orange zest, pineapple, a little bit of grainy, biscuity malt, then a perfect resolution of strawberry, watermelon, peach juice, and bitter pine needle. This is incredibly tropical and incredibly complex. There's not much else to say other than that it is perfection.
M. Light to moderate carb, with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Balance is impeccable...it's big and tropical and dank while not being bitter, sticky sweet, or boozy. Outstanding.
O. One of the best IPAs I have ever had. It's got one of the biggest tropical notes I have found and somehow avoids the "sticky sweet" trap and keeps things hoppy and dank throughout. Super complex on the nose and the palate, with an impressive number of citrus and tropical fruit notes popping up seemingly everywhere. And a great mouthfeel, like peaches and cream. Maine has been producing excellent hoppy beers for awhile now...Lunch was an absolute revelation. But Dinner may be their best work yet. Do whatever it takes to try this. 1,452 characterssiege06nd, Aug 05, 2014

S: grapefruit orchard next door to an orange orchard, with a pine forest at the far end of the property.
T: grabs you right away with grapefruit bitterness. The taste is crisp and clean like all Maine beers I've tried. I sense a tropical fruit sweetness trying to come forward but not allowed to by the grapefruit. As that battle comes to an end, the pine tastes comes in, releasing the tropical flavors, but the pine keeps them in control now: pineapple, mango.
M: for a fairly bitter, close to West Coast IPA, the feel is amazingly smooth. I mentioned the crispness already, and the carbonation plays well deep into the taste.
O: had this beer next to a Lunch and Another One. Seems to me to be closer to the latter than the former. For me, there is a lack of a nice malt sweetness to balance the bitterness, but that's close to the only thing I have issue with in this beer. 1,010 characterscjgiant, Aug 03, 2014

A - a beautiful hazy orange appearance with a nice white head. 
S - I am not good at recognizing the unique notes but the smell is incredible. A perfect citrusy floral aroma that is quite pronounced. 
T - Again a citrusy explosion. Quite a bold taste that I could almost describe as spicy (probably not the correct term!).
M - Love the bossiness at the end on top of the citrus. Very, very nice.
O - Well my wife and I just did the pepsi challenge with Heady which is my all time favorite and this was a clear winner for me. 100% lives up tp the hype. 737 characterskjlcm, Aug 02, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +1.9%Look : Pours a deeper orange, not too much carbonation, i would say a little less than usual
Smell : Ugh that deep,robust, dankness. My favorite smelling DIPA no doubt. Smell is the opposite of citrus and light. its a heavy pine/almost BO stank. Not lacking in the smell department.
Taste : Similar to the smell, Pine, deep flavors here as well
Feel : Only thing holding this one back as my top DIPA. Not bad at all, just a little on the heavy side. not as drinkable as others (heady, double sunshine etc)
Overall : Damn great beer. Highly recommend. If you want something a little away from your normal citrusy light IPAs. Embrace the dark side, this ones for you. 669 charactersMasters, Aug 01, 2014
4.55/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Drank on-tap at The Thirsty Pig, Portland, ME
Served in a cervoise
A tight, fluffy, finger tall mass of off-white foam topped the hazy, yellow ochre liquid. The head slowly dropped, leaving a drippy wall of lacing in its wake.
The aroma was one of the best I have encountered for the style. Amazingly hoppy and fruity. Peach and apricot notes dominated initially. Super fragrant and remarkably sweet. Tropical fruits came through really strong as well. Lots of passion fruit. Good amount of mango and papaya. Dank, week-like notes were also apparent. Simply put, spectacular. I really wish I could have smelled this all night long.
While the aroma was intensely fruity and sweet, the flavor profile was much more dry and bitter. Orange peel hit hard right off the bat. Grassy hop notes were detectible in the center. The beer finished ultra dry, pithy and fairly bitter with strong notes of grapefruit rind. As the beer warmed, the bitterness subsided a bit. The malt sweetness came forth a bit more and some peach notes were detectible.
The mouthfeel was nearly as impressive as the nose. Super creamy, frothy and slick. The liquid contained an ultra fine, zippy, tongue blanketing effervescence that gave the beer a velvety smoothness.
Dinner is an incredible beer that might have been even better if the flavor profile was more like the aroma. I feel extremely fortunate to have stumbled upon this tap offering while on vacation in Portland. 1,449 charactersDamian, Aug 01, 2014

Dinner pours an orange color with a nice foamy head which recedes in a short amount of time. The flavor profile is very similar to MO (not Lunch), but kicked up many notches. It has an almost dank, citrus flavor that comes through with just the right amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel on this one as absolutely perfect, as is the level of carbonation.
The bottle instructs you to drink it immediately after purchase. I will admit I made a mistake buying 3 cases because the quality did diminish after about two weeks. 
This is a special beer that is worth seeking out. Cheer! 713 charactersMikeMO, Jul 17, 2014

Score: 93
Bottle is from the 05/21/14 release. Served in an Upland snifter and enjoyed on 06/11/14. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Pours a nice orange-peach color with a finger of frothy head that settles to a thin coating. Excellent lacing, good retention. 4.5/5
Smell: Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit and forest-y pine. The nose features a nice mix of tropical fruitiness and grassy/piney hop characteristics. Quite lovely. 4.5/5
Taste: Grapefruit and orange zest, with a nice piney bite on the back half. So...much...grapefruit! Simple, effective and delicious IPA. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Thin and watery, undercarbonated. Watery mouthfeeel, but nice bitterness. Lasting bitterness and grapefruit. 2.5/5
Overall: A really lovely grapefruit bomb IPA that needs more heft and carbonation in the mouthfeel to be a truly elite beer.
Cost: $10 for a 500 ml bottle. 959 charactersjegross2, Jun 18, 2014

Aroma is strong tropical fruits. Mango, peach, pineapple. Sticky smell. Slight onion.
Taste is not as potent as the nose but its clear this is a big boy beer.
Sticky resin taste. Lots of bitterness and tropical fruit.
Mouthfeel is thinner than I'd like for these flavors but its a medium feel.
Not dry or overly thin, just not full enough to stand up to the monster flavors.
Did this side by side with lunch and liked lunch more BUT I can see why people love this beer. Is IN YOUR FACE aroma and flavor. Just a little too much for me. 596 characterszookerman182, Jun 16, 2014

A - beautiful citrus orange with yellow highlights. big meringue head tops a hazy unfiltered beer
S - any tropical fruit you can think of. I'm getting peaches, mango and pineapple. in the background there is enough pine and dank aromas to really balance the fruitiness the hops possess.
T - All the tropical fruit in the nose, touch of honey, floral and piney. 
M - front of the tongue is coated with enough malt body to play perfectly with the dryness and hop resins in the back. Smooooth!

Appearance: Hazy golden/copper color. This is one beautiful looking beer. 
Smell: Very nice. Floral and citrus notes come through. I wish the aroma was a bit stronger.
Taste: Simply perfect. This is a top tier DIPA in my book. IMO, it is as good, if not better than the other well recognized DIPA's out there. 
Mouthfeel: Excellent...very smooth and the carbonation bubbles made my taste buds dance!
Overall: This is the most enjoyable DIPA that I've had. I really wish I could get my hands on more. I hope MBCo brews this more frequently so that it is available on a more regular basis. 654 charactersRAlmeida77, Jun 03, 2014

Pours a slightly hazy golden orange-ish yellow, with a one inch head, and lots of lacing.
Smells heavenly- some resinous pine, with more juicy tropical fruit aromas.
The taste is similar, and even more amazing. Slightly honey-like up front, with lots of orange, pineapple, grass, and flowery hop goodness. Quite dank, as they say. 
Fairly thick mouthfeel for an IPA, almost like drinking hop-infused honey. Just awesome. Low to medium carbonation, very, very drinkable.
This one is another home run from MBC. It's hard to say if it's better than Lunch, but no matter which one you pick, everyone wins. 659 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jun 01, 2014

I have enjoyed a number of different Maine Beer Co. beers and actually have enjoyed Red Wheelbarrow more than Lunch. I wasn't sure what I had in store with Dinner....
Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass.
Pours a lightly hazy medium honey/amber with half a finger of light head.
Aromas wowed me. WOWED ME. Glorious citrus, sticky sweet mango and pineapple. OMG.
Taste was incredible. Enough malt to support incredible hop flavors. Mild bitterness.
Mouthfeel was very very nice, inviting, a touch dry, left my palate wanting more.
Overall, this is as close to the big Vermont IPAs that I have ever tasted from a brewer outside of Vermont. This beer is so far and away from any other MBC beer I have tasted. Lunch isn't even close, not even remotely close to this beer.
This beer may be the biggest surprise beer I've had in recent memory. I knew it would be good. I wasn't expecting to be bowled over. WOW. 966 charactersBoldRulerVT, May 28, 2014

Smell out if this world. Big punch of peach with hints of tropical fruits, lemon, and maybe even a little mint.
Taste follows the nose with a little more emphasis on the lemon and mint. Crisp dry finish with perhaps over-the-top bitterness. Probably would like this beer more with a fuller body or lower IBU number.
Mouthfeel is very dry with plenty of zesty carbonation. 
Reslly a great beer but I think the bitterness distracts from some of the delicate hop flavors that would really set this beer apart 594 charactersCurtFromHershey, May 28, 2014

Pours a lightly hazy light golden color with a decent sized long lasting frothy white head. Huge tangerine, melon, and resinous citrus aromas. Damn that is frikin divine. The flavor is firm tropical fruit pine and citrus hop flavors with just a hint of sweet bread deep underneath. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Good lord that is a damn fine IPA right there. Huge juicy fruity hop aroma and flavor. I wish I had more. 486 charactersjohnnnniee, May 26, 2014

A strong swirl of my glass only aids the beer's pillowy head. The head settles down noticeably as a thin blanket of white fuzz. Lacing is quite sporadic.
S-The hops are resoundingly aromatic. I pick up lots of onion and garlic but it's not the predominant hop aroma. Dinner is also loaded with specifics such as passion fruit, pineapple, mango, peach and apricot. A supple layer of malty, bready sweetness helps out as well.
T-The hops are so aggressive yet so classy all at the same time. Again, I get some hefty green onion and garlic. Then comes the ridiculous onslaught of tropical flavors. Mangoes, melons and papayas abound! 'Dank', marijuana flavor as well. Pick a hoppy flavor descriptor and it's there - each sip brings forth more unique hoppy flavors. Caramel and bready maltiness pops up slightly. In the end, it's all about the hops and the flavors here are spectacular.
M-Creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied, softer carbonation. The bitterness is sneakily potent; it hides behind the flavor and proceeds to constrict my taste buds. Alcohol is ever so noticeable.
O-Dinner is an unbelievable beer with plenty of grit and muscle. Yet, the balance between power and complexity is what makes this beer elite. I have always been a Maine Beer fan but this beer just made everything different. Dinner is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. 1,433 charactersVelvetExtract, May 24, 2014

I've had a bottle from every release but the first one. I've also had on draft a few times at brewery and Novare Res. I have to say I prefer it from the bottle as opposed to draft. 
The aroma on this beer is probably the thing that stands out the most. As soon as you pop the cap you are rewarded with nose bliss. Color is what you expect from an East Coast DIPA, not quite orange juice like some Tree House beers but a very nice hazy, orange. 
The beer holds up nicely for about 3 weeks and it really starts to fall off. I've found it's best to have about 4-5 days after bottling, imo. 
This would be the beverage at my last diner if I was on death row (not sure they accommodate such requests, but I'd request it and probably get a Stone IPA). 776 charactersNichols33, May 22, 2014

A - Soft yellow color with a nice head, great sticky lace retention
S - Citrus explosion. Grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange peels, grass, amazing!
T - Follows the nose initially and then you get a pine blast. Unique balance
M - Soft and supple feel, high carbonation, biting with a dry finish
O - A remarkable DIPA. Wonderfully balanced between citrus and malts. The aroma is out of this world. This will appeal to hop heads and fruit forward IPA fans. The world can only hope this will be added to their regular lineup. Bravo! 602 charactersrjp217, May 22, 2014

Appearance: A bit cloudy / hazy, especially compared to other IPA's in this class. More then likely this is due to how incredibly fresh the beer was along with the brewing process. It may have cleared a bit had I let the bottle chill for a couple of weeks...but let's be honest, that wasn't going to happen :p
Smell: Incredible...floral with huge notes of citrus (grapefruit) hitting you in the face...in a very good way.
Taste: Perfection. Incredibly clean tasting, and exactly what a double IPA should be. Bitterness was just right, and far from overpowering. I took my time with this beer, and enjoyed it at various temps. Past double IPAs have produced hints of alcohol as the beer warms. Not Dinner...it changed in flavor, but not for the worse.
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, very enjoyable.
Overall: This was, by far, the most enjoyable IPA that I have ever had. I really wish that the batch had lasted more than 4 days, as I would have purchased more for sure. They have to be making another batch....Right ME Beer Co? Please tell me you are! :) 1,174 charactersDudon, Apr 15, 2014

The aroma has lots of grassy notes, along with some grapefruit. Earthy funk notes of mango and mellon are also present.
Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is creamy with mild carbonation. The flavor has a fair amount of malty sweetness, but it's all about the hops. Lots of grass and grapefruit citrus. Towards the end spicy notes of garlic and pepper appear. It finishes with grassy bitterness and some earthy funk. Once gone the citrus and funk lingers on the palate.
A tasty beer with a great mouth feel. Drink fresh to get all the hop goodness. 689 charactersWanderingFool, Apr 05, 2014

Nice golden straw with abundant offwhite head and a super sticky glass coating lace. Smell of super floral and a bit of hop resin.

Appearance - nice golden straw colored pour with good head and lacing that lasts throughout the drinking
Smell - really the only place I can knock this beer. It's not a bad smell, I'm just comparing it to some of the more floral IPAs which I enjoy more, it's actually really fragrant. 
Taste - hops are phenomenal and really shine through has a smooth sweet hop taste with some citrus notes that I seem to pick up a little more as it warms. It's a well balanced hop profile though. 
Mouthfeel - nice mouthfeel while drinking goes down smooth with barely any booze all while maintaining a nice carb feel
Overall might be my favorite from MBC overtaking mo for the number one spot. Really hope this turns into a regular offering.

I also had a glass on tap while i was there. Super hazy copper color with a thick bright white head. Smells like a bouquet of fruits, melon, grapefruit, citrus. It does have a faint dirty feet stank if you huff on it enough, not complaining it smells great overall. Tastes like it smells, super fruity. Reminds me less of "Lunch" and more of "Another One". Seems to be a cranked up version of "Another One" and as much as i love this beer, I think I'd rather have it in it's single form. Overall, this is fantastic and i'm glad i drove 3 hours for four bottles, amazing beer. Cheers. 678 charactersmjstacker, Mar 12, 2014
4.73/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On tap at the brewery. Have been to MBC a few times, and this was the busiest and for good reason. Dinner is the real deal. Everything you like from Lunch and other MBC ales - fresh, innovative, equisitely crafted - just a lot more of it...and yet the barrel aged king Titus porter was maybe the best beer on tap. 313 charactersmrz200, Mar 12, 2014
4.83/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Picked up on 3-11 at the brewery. Drank that same night, bottle dated 3-11. Amazing. It's a great looking beer. Orange/yellow/pink, murky, decent head and lacing. Really, I just like the color. Wow, the aroma is incredible. It's so juicy. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some pine and you can definitely detect a strong bitter citrus rind. The bitter citrus is the most dominate feature here. The taste is very bitter up front, with notes of citrus, and a piney aftertaste. Also a bitter pineapple juice flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, med carbonation. Huge dry hop taste lingers for a while. Definitely one of my favorite bitter DIPA's. There is a little bit of alcohol burn on the end, but it's well hidden, as it's mixed in with all that bittery goodness. Really hope they make this again. Definitely don't mind the brewery only aspect if I can pick this up on same day bottling, either. 921 charactersMikeypnh, Mar 11, 2014
4.78/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Picked up four bottles at the release and enjoyed it on draft at the brewery along with the Barrel Aged King Titus. Both were mindblowers.
As for Dinner, the nose is all tropics – papaya, pineapple, a tiny bit of banana, and deep notes of guava. It’s Carmen Miranda in a glass. The first sip is a muted flash of bitter astringency, but only a flash, then it’s a wash of grapefruit and guava and siloed grain. The bottle pour into a stemmed MBC glass offered a muted nose compared to the draft, but I'll admit it was poured a bit too cold. Once it opened up, both nose and mouthfeel were full and glorious. 
As for the appearance, words do not exist to describe the orange hue of Dinner. The closest you can get would be to lay in the grass on a bright late-summer day and shield your eyes from the sun with your fingers until they reproduce this amazing color. 
The easy description is "Lunch on steroids" but I find it to be closer in aroma, appearance, and flavor to MO. So, "MO on steroids." But that description does injustice to the delicate, yet powerful balance the Klebans have achieved here. Just a wonderfully perfect experience. 1,148 charactersmillionsuns, Mar 11, 2014
