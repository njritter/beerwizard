Definitely more going on taste wise than the nose suggests, very roasty, dark chocolate, prune, oak, whiskey

Smells has me concerned. There's a very, very evident sour green apple smell I'm picking up. Mild bourbon, no roast, lots of candied sugar.
Taste like watery acidic nothing. This is nothing like the base beer. Something is very wrong here. It's mostly flat which is perplexing given that it's only a year old and wax sealed. This is clearly a botched bottled. I traded for this and gave no idea the history of how it was stored etc but this is a sad, sad drain pour.
--------------------------
2-16-17 new review. Very eager to retry this.
This time it's a draft pour. 1 hour old it was poured to a 16oz mason jar growler. From there it was poured into a snifter at home.
Dark coca cola inky body, lots of frothy khaki head. Sticky, sugary lacing. (Appearance bumped to 4.25 from 4)
Smells heavily of dark fruit and molasses. Lots of carmel,vanilla and oak. Bourbon comes through just right, not too strong and well meddled in. Still getting something faint along the lines of a granny smith apple. (Smell bumped to 4.25 from 2)
Tastes roasty and sweet at the same time. Lots of cream, lots of vanilla cues. More char than I recall from the base beer strangely. Bourbon isnt that prominent in flavor. (Taste bumped to 4.0 from 2.0)
Mouthfeel is awesome. It's creamier than most oatmeal stouts. It's very, very mild on the carbonation and heavy in body. Also quite dry. (Feel bumped to 4.75 from 1.5)
Overall. A much better experience. Very good beer, but after all the bb stouts I've had over the last few years I'm honestly not sure this is among the best of them. It's good, but not awesome like I wanted it to be. (Overall score bumped to 4.25 from 1) 1,726 charactersrypkr, Jan 07, 2017

S- Mostly bourbon and dark chocolate. A little bit of vanilla and coffee. 
T- A little bitter up front. Roasted malts, bitter chocolate and coffee. Good fudgy, chocolatey base with a bit of vanilla. 
F- Smooth. Solid thickness and creaminess on the palette despite being slightly on the thin side. 
O- Pretty solid. It definitely has flavor. It's slightly too bitter for me, but I like the change of pace. I'd like to be able to keep a couple of these around. 560 charactersZoomslowik, Dec 25, 2016

Poured from the bottle into a glass.
Inky black appearance. 
A rough pour yielded a small dark tan head; almost no lace. 
Oak, dark cherry, marshmallow & bourbon notes in the nose. 
Thick, sticky mouthfeel. 
Bakers chocolate & dark cherry flavors up front; oak & bourbon notes on the finish. Banana notes emerged as this warmed. A bit boozy when fresh, but the nose points toward transcendence. The rest are sentenced to the cellar... 491 charactersGuyFawkes, Dec 23, 2016

4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Aroma and flavor of dark baker's chocolate, booze, smoke, coffee, and oak. Distinct taste of black licorice too, which is really nice. A fairly rich stout, in the vein of Parabola and BCBS, but with a unique smokiness and more relaxed booziness, and boasting some of that licorice flavor you get from Expedition. Quite enjoyable.
But I should say that I'm a bit torn on how to rate it. First time I had it, I loved the unique smoke and licorice aspects. Subsequent tastings have left me non-plussed. Having had the 2013, 2014, and 2015 batches I've found the 2014 especially has an off-putting tuna fish aroma, related I would guess to perhaps the oxidization of smoked malts? All batches could use a bit more body, and maybe a bit more bourbon character. Still quite enjoyable, and so I suppose I enjoy it more than Parabola, but less than BCBS. 847 charactersPDXAmbassador, Aug 24, 2016

The smell is heavy chocolate and coffee with notes of bourbon.  There is a nice balance between the sweetness and bitterness.  The chocolate and coffee are both present, and the bourbon comes in on the aftertaste.  
I haven't had non-BA Plead the Fifth, but the bourbon isn't very strong on this.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but regular Pt5 might be just as good. 447 charactersnawpnawp, Jun 25, 2016

Dark, black appearance with a slight amber ring on the edge of glass.  Smell was basically same as regular Pt5th.  Taste had some bourbon presence but not nearly as much as you would expect out of a double digit abv stout.  Some raisin and black licorice taste.  The sad highlight of this beer is how fast it must have fallen off.  I don't know if it wasn't cellared properly or what, but back end was all cardboard and nothing resembling an imperial stout.  I got nothing resembling what people are describing in reviews below mine.  Very disappointing. 586 characterseifster82, Jun 19, 2016

Smell: cinamon vanilla coconut sugary rasin sweet chocolate 
Taste: upfront vanilla charcoal middle of the mouth sugared coverd rasin malt sweetness  a faint cinamon sticky sugary milk chocolate. Finished with a real sharp dark roasted coffee dark chocolate a little bit of smokiness and some alchool heat present.
Feel: medium body a nice coffee biterness lingers in the finish.
Overall: it has all the flavores you look for in a barrel aged stout. Though I wished the flavores were more in your face especially that cinamon I got in the nose. Still a little boozy to could age longer which isn't a big surprise still pretty young. Saying all that this beer is still pretty damn good! 704 charactersMasonz223, Jun 18, 2016

Smelled of barrel, bourbon, chocolate, and hints of vanilla and coffee. Taste did not follow suit. There was a bit of chocolate up front but something was lacking in the middle. The taste of the barrel connoted more green wood than barrel wood.  At the end there is a flavor that merges and connotes a very woody expression. The mouth feel was stupendous. Thick and coating. Overall this is a very good beer with a great nose that needs to work a bit on the taste. 520 charactersAmguerra305, Jun 16, 2016

12oz bottle poured into a snifter
A- pours a jet black color with a small foamy dark tan head that sticks around for a while before settling into a ring around the edge of the glass
S- aroma opens with a mixture of dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, black cherries & light espresso.  There's a nice oaky bourbon note that flows throughout the aroma, adding light touches of vanilla, coconut & spicy wood
T- opens up with smoky charred roasted malt flavors that brings out a coffee-like bitterness, followed by a big hit of bourbon barrel that brings notes of spicy wet oak, caramel, vanilla and bourbon.  The finish brings a sweetness of dark fruits, along with a linger of caramel and more bourbon
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a  viscous mouthfeel that turns creamy into the finish 
O- an already awesome RIS receives a barrel treatment very well, creating a sipper that gets better as it warms 933 charactersTreyliff, Jun 09, 2016

4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a viscous opaque shiny black with pretty much no head. There was a hint of foam along the outside of the beer, but nothing beyond that. Beer appeared to be still with next to no carbonation.
Smell had aromas of cocoa, milk chocolate, espresso, and roasted malts. All of this was encompassed by a bourbon aroma that was present but not at all overwhelming. The base beer still shined through while the barrel character also came through. Mild aromas of sweet bourbon are also noted. 
Taste follows the nose with notes of cocoa, milk chocolate, espresso and a slight almond-like nuttiness come through. Barrel characteristics are noted throughout with notes of bourbon, oak, and hints of vanilla coming through. Wonderful balance between the barrel and the base stout - its really one of the best BA stouts out there.  
Feel was thick, smooth, and velvety. Drinks like a decadent stout. However, its still very drinkable and hides the high ABV very very well. 
Overall this was one of the best BA Russian Imperial Stouts I've ever had - like top 5. If you like barrel aged beers, this is a must try. 1,107 charactersFBarber, May 30, 2016

I love normal Plead the 5th.  Of course when they barrel age it, it takes it to another level.  Pours thick and super dark.  Not too much head on it.  Taste is absolutely wonderful, with chocolate and bourbon.  A fair amount of heat, but I love the heat.

4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance. 
Body : Dark. Dark dark dark. Obsidian, cascadian, just...dark. Nothing escaping from this pit of black. 
Head : Angry reddish brown with 2 fingers fading to a ring in my snifter. 
Aroma. 
Initial : Dark fruits, namely plum and black cherry; some burnt malts, a hit of coffee, and a sappy bourbon aroma chasing everything. 
With Agitation : adds a shade of brightness over everything - tart cherries, melon, and chocolate fountain. 
Taste.
Front end : Explosion of dark malts, burnt cocoa, tobacco.
Back end : Theres the Plead The Fifth we all love. A sweet, syrupy chocolate rush with plums, raisins, and dark cherry
Finish : The bourbon hits and the heat rises up from the throat to dry out the tongue. A sweet, sappy, syrupy chocolate/dark fruit/bourbon/ground coffee note persists and tantalizes for another sip. 
Feel.
I mean, how do I explain a feel that I don't particularly pay attention to because it's so right on the money? The flavor and aromas are overwhelming enough, but the feel fits it just like it should with buzzing carbonation, dryness, and succulent sweetness. Lick the lips and you want more. 
Overall : Who was even surprised here? Dark Horse makes some of the best stouts around and there's no doubt they know what they're doing. They've taken a perfect stout to another level by barrel aging it. If you lke the original Plead The 5th, this is one to check out when you're feeling like you want just a bit more heaviness and warmth to coddle you. 1,487 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Mar 16, 2016

A - A deep brownish-black, with a thin tan head after pouring that disapates to a light film with a heavier ring.
S -  Bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt
T - Silky bourbon with chocolate notes and coffee. Maybe a hint of leather.
M - Just about perfect. Substantial mouthfeel without being too heavy. Very smooth with the right amount of oiliness.

Oak, Bourbon, vanilla, coffee, and a roasted note.
Bourbon, vanilla, coffee, oak, and a warming booze finish.
Mouthful is medium to heavy and super smooth.  Carbonation is very low.  Finish lingers.
An extremely well balanced beer.  Very drinkable with hidden alcohol only present on the finish and as it warms.  Mouthful is nice, not too heavy but not light.  The minor negatives and I mean minor might be the oak being so strong on the nose.  Seek this out and try it against the regular Pt5th. 559 charactersSlack, Mar 13, 2016

All chocolate.
It pours a jet black with not much head. Very thick and oily looking.
The smell is roasty, chocolatey goodness.
The taste follows the nose with a huge hit of chocolate and the dark rich roasted flavor I like in a big BB stout. This still had a good amount of the bourbon barrel flavors in it. 324 charactersearljones199, Mar 06, 2016

A: Pours black with a tan colored head, no head retention, slight lacing, not much carbonation, looks like motor oil, looks really nice. 
A: Bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, dark fruits, touch of coffee, no alcohol on the nose, has a lot of aroma, I could smell the bourbon and vanilla as I poured, very nice. 
T: First impression is that this is very balanced and full of flavor, bourbon up front, vanilla, hint of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, dark fruits, touch of moderate coffee-like bitterness, finish is dry with notes of bourbon and dark fruits, the alcohol is noticeable and some heat lingers in the finish, but this drinks incredibly smooth for the high ABV.
M: Full bodied, low carbonation, dry finish, smooth, creamy mouthfeel, some heat but the other characteristics impress enough that the heat does not affect the pleasure of drinking this beer.
O: Very impressed, incredible amounts of aroma and tastes, big full bodied creamy smooth mouthfeel. I really wish I could this in southern California. 1,072 charactersBrolo75, Feb 27, 2016

The Tres Blueberries is outstanding but Plead the Fifth is on another whole level. I opened up a 2013 vintage on 2/17/16 and despite the 2+ years of aging, the bourbon barrel still comes through tremendously. There is very little head and not much aromatics either besides the wood of the barrel. I picked up a lot more dark chocolate in the initial notes and bourbon at the end with not much coffee given the age. Complexity remains and their is tremendous balance that lends drinkability regardless of its strong abv. 578 charactersTrevor11, Feb 18, 2016

4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75'14 Vintage bottle given to me unexpectedly by a craft beer enthusiast (Aaron <3). Haven't had this before because, for obvious reasons, I've never seen it anywhere. Heard great things, so I'm expecting great things. I wonder how this will be with 2-3 years on it (if you include how long it was in the barrel). Bbl #100.
Appearance: Aggressive-ish pour didn't do a whole lot at all for a head. Tiny tan ring on top of the beer, but that's it. In the glass, the beer looks black and viscous. Plays the part of a BBA'd imperial stout. (4.25/5)
Smell: In a word... mellow, I guess. Great aroma, but all a bit subdued. Maybe a preferred word would be balanced. I'm making it sound like a bummer. Nice bourbon, vanilla, and oak nose, with some coffee. There's a faint amount of booze as well, and quite a bit of sweetness. Right now, I think this may be past its prime just because its aroma is on the quiet side. I may also be crazy. Regardless, this stuff smells incredible. (4.75/5)
Taste/feel: Starts off with a rich roasted coffee flavor with a bit of chocolate until mid-sip where more depth/the barrel starts to come through and stay until the finish -- very pleasant and usual BBA'd flavors come in, like the barrel itself, bourbon, and vanilla. I get a little plain cake doughnut in there on the back end too, which is something I pick up occasionally in the style. The alcohol is exceptionally well-hidden, no doubt helped by the age on this bottle -- I don't taste or feel much alcohol at all. This is impressive to me just because I've yet to personally have a BBA'd imperial stout that was aged this long. The mouthfeel on this isn't ideal at first, but it's close. It goes in feeling a little thin with an unexpected fizz of carbonation, but as it sits on the tongue, it eventually starts to thicken and slicken (not a word, my apologies) up. Delicious as all hell. (4.75/5, 4.5/5)
The more I drink this, the more I believe the time to drink the '14 Vintage is NOW. There is no alcohol to really note, and the flavors are not going to randomly improve with more age. If you have any '14, drink it up or trade it up or give it up now so everybody is happy. This is truly a remarkable BBA'd stout. The way the age (presumably, given some reviews of fresher bottles) has mellowed this beer out has made it one hell of a delicious beer. I wish I had a lot more of this stuff, but I can't thank Aaron enough for this one bottle. If you have the opportunity to buy or trade for it, certainly do... just remember to not sit on your bottles for too long. Beer is meant for you to consume, not store in a shoe box in your bedroom.

A bit of foam can be stirred up with a swish of the glass.  The nose on this beer is quite good.  Loads of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, wood, and some alcohol.   Very pungent.  The taste is of fudge and coffee.  Big Chocolate bomb here.  There are slight hints of vanilla and some oak, maybe some bark.  Not overly sweet at all.  Love the bitterness in this one.  The finish is pretty thick and luscious, but could be a little more full.  This is truly a great beer though.  Do not drink this one below 45 degrees as the flavors and texture really come out as it gets closer to room temp. 694 charactershardysf, Feb 10, 2016

The taste is sweet, bitter and a bit sour, with notes of sweet bourbon, dark cherries, vanilla, cocoa and dark chocolate. The alcohol is quite present, but not too annoying.

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark brown head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, bourbon, vanilla, toasted oak, light smoke/char, light licorice/raisin, and roast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, bourbon, vanilla, toasted oak, light smoke/char, light licorice/raisin, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, bourbon, vanilla, toasted oak, light smoke/char, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is a world class barrel aged imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth and easy to sip on for the big ABV. The barrel integration and balance was absolutely spot on. There was no additional booziness or warming alcohol vs the base beer of similar age; and you still get plenty of the barrel flavor characteristics that aren’t overwhelming to the base stout at all. An insanely amazing offering. 1,989 characterssuperspak, Jan 03, 2016

Even for a barrel aged beer, I was a little disappointed in the amount of head produced with a hard pour straight down the middle. It still looks very nice otherwise. Dark and fairly viscous. 
Smells incredible! Tons of milk chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, light coconut, roasted barley. Not really hot at all for a very fresh batch. 
The flavor basically lives up to the expectations. It does drink a little hotter than it smelled, but not bad.Everything else is there.  A bunch of bourbon character without being overpowering at all. Lots of oak and molasses. 
I am really impressed with the body. It didn't seem to lose any of that fullness during the aging process. 
This is one of the better barrel aged stouts out there which isn't a surprise because the base beer is so solid. Every bit as good as I expected 850 charactersWesMantooth, Dec 25, 2015

Aroma has a bit of meaty thing going on then bourbon, caramel and coconut. Some earth and char with plenty of booze.
This is a boozy tasting brew with roast, earth and a surprising amount of coconut. A little solvent then slight caramel and vanilla.
This is medium in body with modest carbonation. Pretty good stuff that has really not decreased in intensity for the 2 years it has been aging. I see what all the buzz is about now but if I had more bottles id likely age them even longer. 622 charactersstakem, Dec 24, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Quick review:
Inky to oily pour, head struggles to make appearance.  Thin ring of brown head, swirl shows carbonation is present.
Initial nose banana cream pie, but cold beer.  Chocolate/coconut/coffee nicely balanced but light in scent, mid-pour.  Little more cocoa on a warm beer.
Taste is a nice balance of dark chocolate brownie, banilla, coffee powder.  Rich flavors, blended well.  Bourbon and wood come in late, as an accent.  True stout flavors become more prominent on a warmer beer, but flavor lingers more as well.
Lighter beer the expected, and early on the flavors faded too fast.  Warmth added some coating to the flavor, but also just a little chalkiness.
Really enjoyed this beer, including how it changed a little as it warmed.  More true to a stout than say a BCBS, a little smoother but less bold than say a BBB.  Not something to pass up, ever (as if it were that easy to find). 900 characterscjgiant, Dec 21, 2015

Pours deep black with a foamy tan head that disputes into brown sugar lace cookies. Deep and thick this oil black goodness smells of booze, sugar cookies, vanilla and cocoa. It tastes like a mouthful of awesome. Honestly, I dig this more than the BA stout from that other brewery in Grand Rapids. This is a winner. I'll stand in line for it again next year. 409 charactersBlushingMonk, Dec 14, 2015

A. Near black, very very dark. Aggressive pour yielded a small, amber, fine bubble head that quickly dissipated. The result is a faint rim around a massive dark stout. Fairly thick.
S. A nice mix of dark roasted malts, coco, bourbon, and oak. Minor notes of dark chocolate, tobacco, molasses, and leather.
T. Very chocolate-e and bourbon-e. A nice balance between sweet and bitter. Noticeable, and very pleasant, bourbon-soaked oak. 
M. Thick, sticky, full-bodied, and low carbonation.
O. A very well crafted BA stout. This deserves the high ranking. In a world of big dawg ba stouts, this holds it's own notching a coco forward, slightly bitter stout with a great bourbon barrel flavor. 723 charactersmacher0, Dec 11, 2015

A- Opens well and pours a 1" high dark brown head that films out in around 2mins. The head is very airy and the brew nearly black. Might even be too dark to use as a welding glass! 
S- Oodles of bourbon. Tons of heat even though it's only 11%. 
T- Bourbon on bourbon. Did I say lots of bourbon? Aged for a perfect time in a barrel that must have had a nice seepage into it during the bourbon aging. You can sure tell when a company re-uses a barrel but this one is fresh from the first use barrel. Might be a touch overpowering which takes it down from perfect in the flavor department. Touch hot. This one needs to sit. 
M- A touch watery. 
O- Excellent brew. If I ever find it, it's bought be it draft, bottle, whatever. This is an excellent brew on the verge of being perfect. Looking forward to finding more out there but want to let it sit at least 3yrs from vintage date to get that heat down a bit and get the subtle coffee and chocolatiess out of the brew. 
Food Pairing
This food pairing is actually a bit difficult. It's the reason you don't see a lot of reviews of hard liquor with food- it overpowers. With that being said, this brew went very well with....... Chocolate cake with chocolate icing. Bourbon and chocolate pair well together and the cake with definitely move that cake up a level.

4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pitch black and opaque with a one finger beige head that slowly settles  into a thick, lasting ring.  Very good retention for style and ABV, taking a while to settle and lingering throughout the pour.  Sporadic streaks of soapy lacing left behind.  
Nice barrel presence in the nose that's decently integrated into the base.  Stronger oak/wood/toothpick than expected wih sweet, spicy bourbon silky vanilla and marshmallow.  Not overly boozy however with complex barrel character not just a complete bourbon bomb.  Sweet an roasted malts underneath with some robust coffee bean, oatmeal, dark chocolate and liquid smoke.  Some dessert like sweetness with silkier, lighter chocolate, lactic cream, caramel, toffee and bakers chocolate.  Pretty tame aroma but it's complex and well rounded. 
Fuller end of medium body with a strong, boozy barrel character that's nicely integrated into the flavors of the base beer.  Again, there's a strong charred oak/toothpick character along with prominent spicy bourbon and boozy heat dominating the flavor.  Lots of spicy bourbon along with vanilla bean and mallow.  A touch of cinnamon and spicy heat but not too hot or overbearing.  Although there is plenty of alcohol flavor, the high ABV is relatively well masked.   Underneath the strong barrel flavors, there is some robust, roasted dark malt notes with burnt sugar, coffee grinds and bitter dark chocolate complimenting the oak and spirit.  Could use a bit more sweetness but this beer is nicely balanced and surprisingly easy to drink at 14%.  The complexity of the barrel component adds depth of flavor making this beer very enjoyable. 1,633 characterscorby112, Nov 21, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Very dark, viscous pour with a thin brown head that barely retains. The nose is rich and bourbony. I could smell this beer the moment the cap was removed. Bittersweet chocolate, toasted oak, bourbon, a little dark fruit, and some candy-like sweetness. Nice!
Full body with a rich bourbon-forward flavor and a nice silky feel. Lots of bittersweet chocolate and coffee with the bourbon coming on strong around mid-palate. Not much vanilla, as the heavy chocolate tends to mask some of the toasted oak. I do get some dark fruit near the finish and a little alcohol warmth as well. Some coffee and chocolate lingers behind.
I'm always amazed at how the top-of-the-line bourbon-barrel-aged stouts get so much bourbon flavor into their beers without making them boozy. Like all the best ones, this one drinks like a liqueur. It reminds me a lot of Bell's Black Note Stout, only with more chocolate in the profile. It's amazing stuff and I hope I am fortunate enough to get to try it again someday. 993 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Nov 20, 2015

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Look - Black with a dark brown head that dissipates quickly.
Smell - Sweet; thick of bourbon and molasses with chocolate and dark malts present as well.
Taste - Not quite as intense on the bourbon as the nose was, surprisingly.  The caramel taste melds with the bourbon to create a smooth, sweet, rich flavor that doesn't quite have the bite that bourbon would have on its own.  Taste some oak, chocolate and tobacco (I am smoking an Oliva cigar with it which probably brings out that aspect).
Feel - Exactly what you want a good stout to feel like, thick, oily, but still smooth.
Overall - A very good BA stout (that pairs well with a medium body cigar!) 659 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Nov 17, 2015

Previously had the 12 and 13 at the 4 Elf party on draft and remembered them fondly, the review is for the 2014 bottle however.
Great looking oily stout, very dark.  Aroma of bakers chocolate, burnt chocolate, charred oak, note of espresso.  Palate follows suit - the bitter chocolate and roast take the first and only step.  Maybe a bad bottle, but this was very one-note.  I remember the 12 and 13 being fudge bourbon bombs and north of 4.5 rating wise.  So it goes. 483 characterstimc100, Sep 27, 2015

Pours viscous like oil. Not much head, just lacing similar to espresso. Lace remains in a ring on the edges of the glass. The beer sits like black coffee in my snifter. 4.75
Soy sauce bomb on the aroma. Dark chocolate and oxidized hops. Subtle caramel and vanilla and sweetness. Light molasses. 4
Also heavy on the soy sauce, but there's more dimension here. Oak and bourbon notes and a richer dark chocolate flavor. Sweetness appears mid-palate and imparts caramel, oatmeal cookie (which also lingers on the finish) and vanilla. Traces of booze creep in. 4
Medium body and occasional creaminess while at other moments booze appears and thins out the feel. There's a bit of a spicy feel from the bourbon as well. Bitter and dry on the finish. 4.25
Pretty good. I have no complaints. 827 charactersONovoMexicano, Sep 20, 2015

Smells a bit thin with milk chocolate, cocoa and coffee. Taste is big milk chocolate and really great coffee, slight bitterness, minimal vanilla. Feel is wonderful with lingering coffee and cocoa. Overall such an excellent brew here. My new favorite go to. 345 charactersdeadsincebirth, Aug 28, 2015

smell is savory, smokey. a little bourbon on the back. Some chocolate as well. But mostly smokey. 
taste comes through with a good amount of smoke, chocolate. No typical hard booze that you'd expect in a bourbon county or parabola. The barrel aging just adds a layer of complexity. 
I honestly wouldn't know this was even aged in bourbon barrels without the label suggesting. Just a really awesome russian imperial stout. 518 charactersraynmoon, Aug 16, 2015

The bubbles fade to a ring after a couple minutes. The aroma is silky chocolate milk. Big vanilla. Plenty of caramel in the background. Mild oak. Medium bourbon, sweet and rich. Some booze. The taste is sweet with milk chocolate and vanilla. Mild roast. Creamy full flavor. Medium to moderate bitterness in the finish. Smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink for a big barrel-aged stout.

Pours out very dark/deep brown with a nice mocha brown head that dissipates quite fast. Smells follows right into the taste with strong notes of chocolate and bourbon. Some coffee and a hint of tobacco in there as well. Roasted malts finish it off. 262 charactersCoorsy, Jul 21, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One of the better beers in the style once it cools down. Like many fresh  imperial stouts that spent time in bourbon barrels it was hot at first but it hits it's sweet spot somewhere 6 months and 2 years. 
Hot barrel characteristics went away and left a nice vanilla character from the barrel along with some coconut. Really nice mouthfeel just under what I'd call world class. Well balanced with roasted and chocalate character. Some nice dark fruit notes can be found as well. 
Great beer. Well worth  seeking out if you are a fan of the style. 548 charactersbeardown2489, Jul 14, 2015

L- not at all the motor oil many described, not even black. More of a deep brown, with a nice mocha head, pleasant appearance but no standout.
S- had a slightly metallic tinge at first when cold, but went away after warmed slightly. Bourbon present but very muted. Roasty, malty, dark fruits - maybe some raisin, and slightly vinous.
T- very similar to smell. Bourbon pretty muted, dark fruit is strongest secondary flavor to the malts.
F- mouthfeel is excellent. Low carb, pretty full mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth.
O - solid beer, really enjoyed mouthfeel. Was hoping for more of a bourbon barrel presence, but enjoyed the straightforward flavors without having much "adjunct" qualities of chocolate, coffee or vanilla that seems to be all the rage lately. 849 charactersBferber, Jul 08, 2015

Pours one shade shy of black with a two inch, loose, mocha-colored head that dissipates into a fizzy swirl around the shoulders.  Nose expresses cocoa, roast and a slightly vinous quality.  Taste follows nose - really not getting much of the barrel here.  There are also some oxidized notes towards the back.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild carbonation and a light acidity.  Overall, not bad but a bit thin and lacking the barrel presence. 565 charactersJwale73, Jun 29, 2015

Look: so thick and dark, with a great light brown head.
Smell: bourbon, vanilla, tobacco, pecan pie.
Taste: bourbon, alcohol heat, vanilla, tobacco. Little roast or bitterness, some chocolate. No dark fruits, cherry, etc. Some bacon-like savory flavors.
Feel: medium, maybe a bit overcarbonated, a bit dry on the end.
Overall: not sure if it's the difference in vintage, age, or the barreling, but I liked the 2014 non-BA bottle I had a few nights ago a bit better than this. The barrel influence overwhelms some of the nuance I got from that. Still, good. 602 charactersneurobot01, Jun 25, 2015

S: some bourbon barrel, but not overwhelming, bitter chocolate, dark fruit, grape gum. 
T: same as the nose, with a little vanilla and oak, and a hint of leather and menthol in the finish.
F: light side of heavy
O: very tasty. The fruit flavored lighten it nicely. Very much a fruity BA RIS as opposed to a chocolatey/roasty BA RIS 377 charactersMissSmisje, May 25, 2015
4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Look:  The beer seems to chug out, versus pouring out of the bottle.  Super dark-brown, sultry body.  The head is a dark mocha that is ultra fine.  At first I thought I could see a reddish hue in the head, but it must be my eyes playing tricks on me.  Or maybe the Ghost in the Machine had a positive affect on my mind.  The melting curtains this beer leaves on the glass are awesome.  Some of the best curtains I have seen.  The curtains are so slipper and slick, no lacing is left on the glass.  An amazing look. 
Smell:  First whiff - Sweetened medium roast coffee with quality cream, balanced superbly.  Even on the booze.  Not too robust, but even, and balanced.    
Taste:  The smell is similar to the taste, and also precedes it.  I wish this tasted as good as the smell.  It doesn't, but it's still a top shelf beer.  All of the flavors are nicely blended and balanced to create a rich, high-end BBA stout.  
Feel:  I have no complaints.  The feel does not disappoint.
Overall - Definitely a world-class beer, and deserving of the place it has been given on the top 250 roster. 1,086 charactersmabermud, May 23, 2015

Aroma is mostly roasted malts and oak.  Bourbon is actually rather subdued for the most part. Fair amount of chocolate and earthy tones. Flavor is pretty sweet, and a healthy dose of the bourbon I was missing in the nose.  I am digging the dark fruits and they only add to the depth.  The body is creamy, rich and full. Runs a little hot, but obviously a BA stout that will only get better with time. 485 charactersBosoxfan20, May 14, 2015

L - Has that motor oil pour and deep, black body with a minimal medium tan head. 
S - Rich aroma of caramel, vanilla, oak, bourbon and roasted malts. 
T - Roasted malts that develop into a sweet bourbon through the middle and a coffee as well as light charred oak ending. 
F - Medium bodied with low carbonation. Has a smooth mouthfeel. The body could be a bit thicker &/or chewier.
O - A legit BBA RIS. Glad I got to try it and wouldn't turn down another. 474 characterscvm4, May 08, 2015

Has a viscous black color, with a dark brown, fizzy head, revealing a small film of lacing at the edge of the glass.
Smells of cocoa nibs, toffee and lots of warm oak, exhibiting distinct vanilla notes. A hint of cinnamon settles among toasted malts and tobacco, while the aromas lead into a rich chocolate direction. Well pronounced barrel reveals quite a bit of Bourbon, which gets gently balanced by melted chocolate. 
Drinks expectedly smooth, letting the complex character evolve.
Tastes of bakers chocolate and fudge, accompanied by whipped cream, while scorched malts, hot oak, cinnamon and mint reveal the beers fantastic flavors. The brews smooth mouthfeel sets new standards, which gets especially well accentuated by carbonized malts, earth and bitter coffee, providing a tremendous range of flavors. Has a hot, oak supported finish, with toffee, fudge and vanilla on top, while coffee creates a long lasting, slightly dry ending, with tobacco and earth.
Awesome beer, incredibly rich in flavors - very focused on creamy chocolate, and roasted coffee with burned malts as its counterpart, while staying focused and in perfect balance. This intriguing melange gets enriched by the hot boubon barrel, adding vanilla and wooden oak to the taste, as well as a hot glow. Chocolate developes on the palate, beginning as creamy milk chocolate, while ending as slick bitter chocolate. 1,457 charactersaleigator, Apr 26, 2015

L - pours almost jet black with a thin ring of mocha foam
S - Prominent bourbon on the nose with hints of coconut and chocolate
T - richer than I remember from last time with chocolate, hints of smoke and a ton of bourbon.  Lots of ash on the finish - a bit too much black patent malt for my preference.
F - On the thinner side for the style.  Wish this had more heft and chew to balance the astringent ash
Overall much better the 2nd time around, but still not quite what I would hope.  Fresh is way better, but the ashy black malt on the finish is a bit jarring 627 characterspagriley, Apr 21, 2015

2014: poured a dark black with a small deep brown head. Smell was sweet chocolate and vanilla. Taste led by vanilla and some milk chocolate, followed by a toffee finish. Mouth was pretty light with little carb.  Overall this is a solid BA stout, the toffee taste was unique.
2013:
Similar look, with a bit less head. Smell added some additional brown sugar notes.  Milk chocolate, vanilla, and some dark fruit, with a bit of butterscotch on the finish. Overall, I think I liked the '13 a bit more. It was a bit more integrated and smoother than the '14. 587 charactersOneEye78, Apr 12, 2015

Aroma is of rich caramel, sweet bourbon, oaky wood and big roasted malts. Flavor is big bitter roastiness up front with a dash of coffee, then it hits with a wave of sugary sweet bourbon, toasted oak and finished with some roastiness and caramel flavors. Definite waves of flavor with this one. This one is full bodied with medium-light carbonation and a slick oily feel. Up there with the great class of BB stouts, very nicely done. 566 charactersstephenjmoore, Mar 25, 2015

4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.512 ounce bottle wax dipped
Appearance is pitch black and resembles motor oil, two fingers of medium brown head, decent lacing and retention
Smell is oatmeal, booze, bourbon, vanilla, both milk and dark cocoa, along with fresh brewed java
Taste starts off with dark chocolate and big coffee notes, fades into oak, vanilla, and Christmas spices, as it warms the whiskey notes come out more, by the end the notes from the barrel are very pronounced and do a great job of rounding out the roastiness
Mouthfeel is full bodied, perfect level of carbonation, a little sweet once it warmed fully through, liked the chewiness from the roasted malts
Overall this is a big tasty beer, alcohol is pretty hidden for 11% but the bourbon makes itself known with all the wonderful barrel characteristics, I prefer the barrel aged version over the standard Plead the 5th, glad I got to try this 882 charactersFloydster, Mar 16, 2015

I tend to not be a huge fan of the bourbon barrel brews but Dark Horse did this one right. The aromas and flavors are never overpowered by the bourbon, they're complimented by it. The mouth feel is a thick syrupy brew that coats the tongue and warms the face. The start is a heavy maltiness which fades quickly into a slightly bitter coffee and finishes with an ever so slight bourbon punch. The fingers on glass tell me this one is going to kick my ass! Really outstanding brew from dark horse 589 charactersMisfit2209, Mar 02, 2015

L- Black, maybe only a slight amount of light on the edges, half a finger of medium brown head that quickly dissipated to a ring. 
S- Raisins, dates, molasses, black cherry, vanilla, alcohol comes through, some dark chocolate and marshmallow in there too.
T- Similar to aroma, lots of dried dark fruits, molasses, vanilla, oak, more chocolate than in the aroma, alcohol is a bit more biting than others of the style, lingering note of chocolate and brown sugar on the end. 
F- Not on the thick side for an Imperial stout, being a bit thinner adds to the drinkability which can be dangerous. Good amount of carbonation for the style. 
O- Very nice and up there with all the other great BBA stouts. Hard to say which BBA stout form Michigan is the best as there are so many great ones you can't lose. 841 charactersPaulyB83, Feb 26, 2015

The aroma Is overwhelmingly bourbony. Stages of flavor: nonspecific heat, roasty malt, chocolate, and a lingering bourbon finish. Everything is executed to a tee. Wish it were easier to get hold of, I only managed to secure two bottles of the 2014. 350 charactersschris, Feb 24, 2015

4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.752012 vintage. Gorgeous nose of dark roast, chocalate and bourbon. 
Taste follows perfectly with a profile that echoes BCBS but lighter in mouthfeel, as this is 11% versus 14% for the other. Balanced and punchy. 
For its " low " ABV the category of mega- BA RIS : it is fantastic. I bet it was much hotter when fresh, but still has strong BB character at 2 years. 
I just had a fresh BA Narwhal that wasn't nearly as good. Over the last week of vacation we tried Black Tuesday and had a few BCBS. This is in good company of those exemplars. 
Outstanding. 557 charactersJjski, Feb 23, 2015

12 oz bottle, 2014, poured into a teku
A- Pitch black with a small mocha head.
S- Bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, oak, dark fruits, roasted coffee.
T- Much more complex than the nose, rich dark chocolate, roasted coffee, charred oak, bourbon, vanilla, some dark fruits, very nicely balanced.
M- Smooth, medium to full body.
O- A very well made bourbon barrel stout.  Sweet but nicely balanced with a bitter finish that lingers nicely.  Truly worth seeking out, nose made me think this was going to be a little one dimensional but it is really complex. 580 characterslarryi86, Feb 02, 2015

4.19/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A- Pours black as night, as expected, with a small and chocolate brown head forming. The head is just a whisp of foam on the top of the beer, but it does leave a pretty good lace pattern.
S- Big and dark roasted malts hit the nose first, just like a good Russian imperial should. Next comes a bit of bourbon barrel spiciness. Oak and vanilla are the prominent barrel scents, with just a touch of the bourbon sneaking in. Towards the back end of the smell, it turns sweeter than most stouts, but then the dark malts return and leave you with traditional stout flavors on the nose.
T- Just like the smell, this beer starts with a bang of deep, dark malts. Slightly bitter dark chocolate and just a touch of coffee hit the tongue and lead you into the middle of the drink. The barrel spice moves in during the middle of the drink with a touch of vanilla and a bit of boozy bourbon. The barrel flavors mix in with the dark malts and form a fairly complex overall flavor. The beer leaves a somewhat bitter aftertaste on the tongue after the drink is finished.
M- The alcohol is evident a little bit while sipping this beer, but it really shines in how smooth it is. Low carbonation levels and a thick and heavy flavor profile make this somewhat of a slow drink. On the whole, this is a silky smooth, thick, and heavy beer that goes down smooth for its weight.
Overall, this beer is very, very good. The great dark malts with chocolate and coffee interact with the bourbon barrel very well without overpowering the malts or becoming to aggressive to be enjoyed. I like this beer. 1,577 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jan 30, 2015

L: Even after a couple minutes, the mocha-colored head sticks to the sides
S: Chocolatey
T: great Imperial stout, no actual bourbon taste. Just the heat from it with chocolates and coffee on the first taste.
F: Milk-stoutish, very nice
O: A pretty great stout but falls very short of any live bourbon character. Tastes like it's all had some age. 360 charactersfloridadrift, Jan 27, 2015

A-  Pitch black, not much of a head but some small brown carbonation and lacing.  Looks thick.
S-  Wonderful aromas of bourbon, cask, vanilla, coffee, and dark tannins.  Some maple syrup sweetness going on as well.  Charred malts and barley present too.  A bit of alcohol present on the nose.
T-  Great balance between the bourbon and beer itself.  Not too much heat on this one and as the nose predicted, lots of dark grains, chocolate, syrup, vanilla and some dry oak.  The flavors blend quite well and make this a smooth drinker.
M-  Full bodied.  A little sticky in a good way.  Rolls off the tongue pretty silky.  Not much carbonation present.
O- Dam fine BA stout.  Not much room for improvement here.  Could maybe use a hint more bourbon if anything, but this is for sure a top BA stout.  Look forward to each year's batch. 868 charactersEveningCordial, Jan 24, 2015

L - Good ol' pitch black that appeared to have an event horizon once poured into the glass.  Little to no lacing.  Head is pleasantly more coffee than I've seen in other BA stouts.
S - Do I have a cold?  I hope I don't have a cold.  Definitely some cocoa and roastiness but not as intense as I would've hoped.
T - Now there it is.  Huge notes of oak, whiskey, birch, dutch cocoa, and jaggery.  
F - Unexpectedly creamy based on the appearance.  Finishes clean with no oily aftertaste.  
O - This, my friends, is a lovely beer that I will be happily standing in the Michigan cold to procure at the next release.  More balanced of a flavor than BCBS, but just short of the mark in the other spaces.  That's not to say I wouldn't hunt for another bottle... 856 characterswaitwhatamidrinking, Jan 20, 2015

The head recedes quickly to a small ring around the edge of the glass. Small spots of lacing and slight legs remain after a swirl.
S: Rich cocoa, marshmallow, and caramel upfront, followed by a hint of bourbon/vanilla that becomes more pronounced as it warms.  Purely decadent, smells like an effing candy bar.
T:  Milk chocolate, and vanilla and caramel notes from the bourbon are most prominent, and are layered with roasty malt and a slight tinge of alcohol.  Delicious.
M: Medium/thick bodied and viscous with a moderate carbonation and a long lingering finish.
O: Damn this was on point.  My first Dark Horse offering and Im impressed. Need more immediately. 755 charactersMore_betterness, Jan 10, 2015

3.84/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.752012 vintage.
Pours completely pitch black with no head. Very faint spots of lace appear during the drink down. 
The smell is of dark chocolate, vanilla, pipe tobacco, dark fruit and faint coffee. 
The taste is dominated by dark chocolate and roasted malt. There is an strong Earthy oak aftertaste. 
The texture is heavy bodied with no carbonation. 
All of the characteristics of a bourbon barrel stout are here but, there is an out of place and unpleasant herbal aftertaste. I'm not sure if the age of this bottle is an issue but, I am underwhelmed with this offering. 574 charactersFurlinator, Jan 04, 2015
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.7512oz bottle poured into a snifter.
A: Jet black pour. Coffee colored head settles quickly. Minimal spotty lacing.
S: Fudge sauce, bitter dark chocolate, mocha. The barrel blends into this, creating scent profiles of chocolate/marshmallow candy and caramel chews. Whiffs of toasty oak and bourbon too. Some berry fruitiness rests underneath everything.
T: Rich mocha flavors and fudge sauce at the outset. Woody roast turns into more acrid flavors of French roast coffee. The barrel brings decadence as it melds with malt. Bourbon balls, walnut brownies, caramel chews and chocolate covered nougat come to the forefront. Quick flashes of figs and dates. Oak and some assertive bourbon toward the back. Bitter dark chocolate, oak, and bourbon on the finish. 
M: Big and thick in body. Coating in the mouth, though not sticky or syrupy. It glides over the tongue with a satiny but chewy texture. Light carbonation. Warming alcohol. 
O: Almost perfect. It's everything you could ever want in a bourbon barrel aged Imperial stout. It's such a delicious sipper in its own right that I fear any attempt at a pairing would only bring it down. Truly a stellar brew. 1,161 charactersryan1788a5, Jan 04, 2015

3.77/5  rDev -15.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Update for 2015 vintage: 12 oz bottle.
Poured a translucent black, little to no head. What head was present was decidedly tan. 
Smells excellent, hints of sweetness. Not overly boozy as some in the style can be. 
Taste is mild, like the smell, it's not overpowering or boozy. Some sweetness and vanilla, seemingly well balanced. However... Taste is also watery. 
Which leads to mouthfeel, which is where this really falls flat. The overall theme of this is "thin". The 2015 vintage Plead the 5th was a touch watery (and odd), and the same seems to be hindering the BA version of Pt5th. They are from different batches, but the same issue persists. 
Overall: Good beer. Has been GREAT in the past, so expectations were high, not quite met. 743 charactersTrent, Jan 01, 2015

Not as much bourbon as some other barrel aged stouts but the flavor goes amazing that you get from it. Smooth nearly oatmeal stout mouthfeel. Would love to try this fresh and as my first beer. 326 charactersFlight317, Dec 11, 2014

Taste is very well balanced, with great barrel character, some sweetness in the beginning but finishing roasty and bitter. Body is not as heavy as other imperial stouts, making it easy to drink. Overall a very nice barrel aged stout, up there with the other big hitters. Reminded me a lot of Bell’s Black Note. 405 charactersCiocanelu, Nov 07, 2014

A  she pours dark alright, thumbnail's edge, a fast falling finger of foam leaves no lace,  wide legs and some color left behind on the glass, dark liquid 
S  charred wood, bourbon, burnt marshmallow, vanilla, heaps of fudge and chocolate syrup, sweetened coffee, more barrel, a hint of smoke, the barrel's done wonders for this one 
T  this has picked up a shitload of flavor from the barrel, strange really how different this is from the base, faint nutmeg, heaps of burnt barrel and the bourbon has a little sweet smoke to it, just a hint of dark fruit and roasted coconut, holy barrel batman 
M  full is an understatement, the bubbles thicken it up even more, very faint heat, my lips are beyond stuck together there might be some super glue in there, massive amounts of char and bourbon with a hint of spice on the finish 
O   a massive improvement over the base beer, strangely so really, one of the better BB stouts I can recall, very intense at every turn 
I have little to complain about as this one sinks into my gut, a big beer that explodes at every turn, I can't recall a barrel transforming a beer like this before, seek and destroy 1,249 characterswordemupg, Oct 22, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6%Serving: Draft pour into a 10 oz. snifter. At this point, I believe this beer is close to 9 or 10 months out from its release. 
A: Barely a trace of light brown head/lacing. Pitch black, but not motor oil black. 
S: Bourbon, chocolate, coffee, faint cinnamon, dark cherry.
T: Bourbon, chocolate. Some smokiness to the flavor. Lots of oak/charred oak. Some creamy sweetness/marshmallow flavors coming through as well.
M: Full, smooth, creamy. Not super chewy or thick.
O: This is a legendary beer, obviously. This is my 3rd time having it, and each time I like it more. I've never been hugely impressed by it, and I normally rank it last among the popular BA Imp Stouts. But that doesn't mean it's not a great beer, it's just I like KBS, Parabola, BCBS, KBS, etc. a lot more. This one reminds me most of Black Note because of the creamy sweetness I pick up. The barrel character isn't huge, unlike BCBS, and I like that here. It's also 9-10 months old, but I wouldn't say it's "aged". I don't get any oxidation or off flavors. Surely not fresh, but not old either. Drinking great right now. It's very drinkable and smooth. Well-balanced. Not my #1 BA Imp Stout, but still one hell of a fantastic beer from DH that I will try to drink every chance I get.
Recommendation: A must-try for any beer lover. 1,305 charactersSparty1224, Oct 09, 2014

Smell: strong sweet chocolate, roasted malts, brown sugar, bourbon and booze. notes of vanilla, oak and dark fruits are lighter.
Taste: opens up with huge amounts of sweetness coming in the form of brown sugar and chocolate. the middle is full of barrel and dark malt character, with bourbon and a strong espresso taste. strong alcohol in the back end along with some dark fruit. 
Mouthfeel: heavy, slick and chewy. large amounts of sweetness but the bitter black malts win out leaving behind some bitterness. warming alcohol
Overall: easily the best beer I have had from dark horse, but with all the great barrel aged stouts out there, this one falls at the lower end of the upper tier. 934 charactersSportsandJorts, Sep 30, 2014

4 once sample on the brewery tour. I've had regular Plead the 5th, so I was excited to try this one. I was not let down. You can tell it is Plead the 5th, just barrel aged. You get all the great chocolate flavors and roasted tastes with a nice addition of boozy bourbon. I really enjoyed this one. 320 characterskkleu357, Sep 15, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +6%Acquired via inebriated Dark Lord Day Trade.. Totally awesome finding a bottle of this in my backpack the morning after.
A - Dark as night, tan head quickly sunk into the abyss.
S - Chocolately, slight bourbon, fudge, vanilla oakiness. Almost identical smell to BCBS, definitely notice a difference in ABV just by the smell.
T - Perfection for a BA IRS, great lingering chocolateyness mixed with subtle barrel aging characteristics. Like the smell, a less boozy BCBS and thats the only .25 off because I happen to like the alarming 14% ABV and im partial to Chi-town's Goose Island... GO BEARS!
M - Coats the palate with a melted brownie, roasted malt liquid. Subtle carbonation does not over/under power the aspects of this brew.
O - Love it, glad I had it, going to try and get some more dressing like an Elf at the party in December. 837 charactersHesscabob, Sep 15, 2014

Pours dark chocolate brown to black. Very little head generated. Fades to the sides quickly.
Smell is of cocoa nibs and bourbon. Not bad, not great.
Taste is amazing chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon booze notes. Mingle together very well.
Mouth feel was good when I poured it near 40 but as it warmed up the feel got thicker.
Overall beats KBS, BCBS, and scores a tad under Black Note for the past year vintages. Well done bottle. First of many from this brewery. 517 charactersJared14, Aug 11, 2014

I am a big fan of stouts/ba stouts and try to have enough regular PT5 to last me from one release to the next, but let me tell you...the barrel-aged version of Plead is just AWESOME! The smell, the lacing of the glass, the mouthfeel...everthing about this beer makes you step back and re-evaluate other BA stouts that you've had in the past. Dark Horse knocked it out of the park with BBPT5, as many already know. I just landed a 2012 vintage and can't wait to try the '12 and '13 side by side. 
Overall....although I didn't break everything down by category, if you have the opportunity to try this at a tasting or whether through a trade, be sure you jump on the chance as this is a fantastic brew that you'll be sure to savor! 870 charactersbeer-wheezy, Jul 19, 2014

Aroma is oak, vanilla and just enough bourbon. Slight chocolate covered dark fruit.
Taste is so complex. Where do I start. Up front is bourbon and toasted oak. In the middle it's chocolate covered cherries and dark chocolate. At the end its light roasted coffee and baking chocolate. No hint of alcohol AT ALL. 
Mouthfeel is so thick and rich. It's like a milkshake. The lingering chocolate bitterness puts is beer on another level. Probably the most chocolate I've ever detected in a beer.
So glad I have a couple more of these. 616 characterszookerman182, Jul 10, 2014

A - Black as night, just under a fingers width of head, decent lacing
S - Bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, char, oak… vanilla pops as it warms. As it warms greater bourbon and tobacco start to come through. Getting closer to room temp the dark fruits like cherry come through.
T - Chocolate, char, roast, bourbon, coffee...espresso aftertaste, even further aftertaste is dark belgian chocolate. As this warms it's getting better… Chocolate covered dark fruits start to come through… did I say espresso yet… damn this is good. No need to refrigerate this one… drink at room temp and you will get all the flavors your looking for. As you get closer to room temp tobacco comes through. This is the best natural chocolate taste you get from a beer due purely to a well balanced grain bill. 
M - Smooth, velvety, rich but not overbearing at any point in time.
O - Perfect on a cool summer night… I want a case of this right now so I can drink it every time I get a fire going in the backyard. When I took my first sip after pulling out of the fridge I was a bit disappointed. DO NOT RUSH THIS ONE. Let it warm up and you will be blessed with an amazing beer.

A -Black. Very Black. Minimal dark brown burnt colored head, nice oilyness coats the glass as I swirl it around.
S - Very nice boozy bourbon aroma that is reminiscent of BCBS. Rich chocolate and coffee hints of vanilla.
T - Great amount of toasted oak from the barrel as well as a nice rich sweet chocolate and slight coffee notes as well as a very nice bourbon presence. I love the regular Pt5, so its no surprise that this beer is even better. 
M - Rich and thick, oily and chewy
This is one of the best barrel aged stouts I have had. Close to Bourbon County in mouthfeel and not as sweet. I will definitely be looking for more of this next year and years to come. 729 charactersChibeerguy1, Jun 28, 2014

The bourbon complements the base perfectly in my opinion and just balances everything out so nicely in this beer. There is a malty, roasty bitterness in the base that is not my preference but that is just me. I caught some molasses here, also, which was a nice surprise for my palate. Looking at it objectively as I can, this beer is so worthy of its WC status. Got to head to Elf Party for more this winter!
Update: Just had the 2013 vintage and it is MAGNIFICENT.  Extremely balanced but with a bit more sweetness. 567 charactersbowzer4birdie, Jun 24, 2014

4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5This big beer is pretty close to black. It looks quite similar to the original (sans the barrel, if you will), with the exception that the sandy head isn't quite as well structured. Still, it rises to about the same height and holds up pretty well, coming only a little short of having the original's staying power and lace.
This beer shows off how tasty it's going to be right off the nose. The bourbon is very nicely integrated, warm but not too hot or abrasive. The stout is already roasty, and good use of a bourbon barrel always seems to smooth it out as well as adding the vanilla and woods that are found in this beer. There was a bit of dark chocolate, plenty of dark fruit that doesn't come off too forcefully but lays under some char, and a certain nuttiness. Hops add just a bit to balance, a light leafy sort of addition. The chocolate notes almost go milky about midway.
This is very nearly as smooth as it gets. A sipper for sure, the brewers took great care to not let alcoholic heat thin it or add too much bite, the body's richness and thickness or its robust fullness to get too sickeningly heavy or slick, and the sweetness to overcome the balancing dry notes that keep it in check. This is one of the silkiest, most smoothly slowing brews I've yet had the pleasure to drink. 1,294 charactersBrenden, Jun 05, 2014

Shared with a craft beer noob…and blew his mind (his brains are still on my ceiling)!
Thanks to I_BYE_MI_BEER for the bottle.
A: Pours “…darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night.” Billows up to one finger of creamy, thick mocha head that dissipated relatively quickly, settling to a persistent, creamy collar and leaving no lacing.
S: A massive nose; big bourbon boozy nose with some hot alcohol; dark roasted malts, cocoa nibs, and some subtle vanilla sweetness.
T: Wow, a really complex profile that starts with thick, rich dark roasted malts, dark chocolate and boozy bourbon. The dark fruits (dates, raisins, prunes), tobacco and sweet malt fill out the palate with subtle vanilla and toffee notes coming out. The finish is long and dries out a bit with some bittering hops and espresso char.
M: Medium-heavy body and low carbonation make it smooth, creamy and rich but not cloying.
O: This is one of the best BBA stouts I have ever had. I loved it…and wished I didn’t share it ;-) 1,077 charactersmtomlins, Jun 03, 2014

The aroma offers thick dark chocolate and almost brownie. Bourbon sweetness, a touch of coconut and almond. 
The beer offers a medium plus mouthfeel, smooth and chewy, and really good for the ABV. Up front is bourbon, dark fruit, rich chocolate. Lingering bourbon on the back with some oak drying, along with a coconut aftertaste. 
It reminds me of ’14 BCBS. 421 charactersdar482, May 24, 2014

A- Poured to a tulip, snifter and a pint glass with a pitch black body. A small, pretty much tiny head forms to just a sheet on the beer and recedes pretty quickly. Small, frothy ring leaves some nice legs but only a few spots of lace.
S- Deep cocoa and Bourbon pretty much rule the aroma with a decadent fudgey feel. Vanilla comes into play from the oak and melds with a somewhat sweet quality coming out. Chocolate chips.
T- Bourbon vanilla brownie is what comes to mind to me. Decadent fudge and cocoa provide a base for the barrels to come alive. Top quality whiskey feel as far as a beer goes with a fresh toasted oak and some vanilla. Deep semi-burnt roast grains, toast and ash.
MF- Thick bodied with a somewhat creamy and chewy feel. Carbonation is moderate to low but lets those flavors truly shine, especially from the barrels. Fairly warming from the ABV with some dark roast bitters in the finish.
Bourbon fudge brownies with a twist of vanilla from the oak. Deep and decadent with a great base of cocoa and roasted malts. The Bourbon flavor in this beer is quite possibly the best I have found. I feel like I am sipping a great shot of whiskey without the heat and ice/water. 1,261 characterscbutova, May 05, 2014

Appearance is dark dark black with a little caramel head. Nose is huge, bourbony, with a slight offputting sourness. Taste is sweet up front, a little roasty, with some bitterness. Nice lasting bourbony finish. Mouthfeel is pretty full. Overall it's above average for a BBA stout. Sourness notwithstanding, it's a nice piece de resistance to Dark Horse's stout series. 445 charactersfoobula, May 05, 2014

4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from 12 oz. waxed bottle into Teku glass. Beer was stored in cellar at 50 degrees and I have been looking forward to trying this one out for a long time. The past week in the PNW has been hot and sunny, today it’s been pouring and the temperature has dropped to the 50s, perfect setting to enjoy this brew. 
The appearance is viscous and obscure, blackberry in color – motor oil would be an appropriate descriptor as well. Almost no head was formed, even after the last portion of the pour was done at 90 degrees into the glass. The little head that briefly formed was mocha in color and quickly dissipated into the darkness of the liquid it covered, forming a thin ring that perfectly surrounds the glass. As I poured the beer its appealing aroma of vanilla and oaky bourbon escapes the confines of the glass, its scent is sensual and inviting. Faint traces of coconut, dark chocolate, licorice and cinnamon linger after the vanilla and the bourbon are absorbed. Upon tasting the beer, you feel it’s silky creamy body touch your tongue and make its way towards your palate. The first feeling you get is a slight burn from the alcohol immediately followed by a balanced invasion of vanilla extract and toasty oak. As the beer dances further in your mouth, dark chocolate and cinnamon make a cameo appearance, albeit short. The aftertaste leaves you with a French roast coffee flavor beneath its aforementioned dominating flavors. Carbonation is very mild, which in my opinion bodes well with its flavors and allow them to take center stage.
Overall – this is an excellent beer that will make it to my permanent ISO list. So rich, well balanced, and easily enjoyable. I also love the fact that such a great BBA Stout is available in a 12oz presentation. In my opinion this tastes & smells like a distant relative to Parabola. 1,841 charactersHoppySeb, May 04, 2014

This beer when you dissect its flavor profile is very clean, definitive and balanced. The barrel aging flavor is so crisp, its truly an amazing beer. The stout backbone from Plead the Fifth is there, creamy as usual and the added BB just puts this at an elite level. This is a beer to seek out as its incredibly well made and balanced. Just a masterpiece, the only downfall is the aroma is weak which is weird because the taste is pronounced and amazing!
Bottom Line: Legendary brew! 527 charactersthemind, Apr 28, 2014
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.512oz gold-waxed bottle from the '13 bottling, poured into a Short's glass. Thanks Sam (theSamKuehn) for this bottle.
A- Pours a pitch black with a thin yet thick and creamy mocha head that recedes to a flat top. Subtle carbonation but nice consistency.
S- Dark chocolate, integrated bourbon, light roast, subtle vanilla/coconut, light figs, and some light integrated oak. Nice balance, all the flavors complement each other very well, fairly complex.
T- Dark chocolate with a hint of bitterness, lightly roasty espresso, very well integrated bourbon that adds a nice vanilla/coconut sweetness to the base, nice chocolaty oak finish with a touch of bitterness and booze. Nice balance, great use of bourbon barrels to add to the flavors of an already great base beer.
M- Silky smooth, creamy, fairly thick bodied, subtle carbonation perfect for the style, very little alcohol burn, just about perfect for a barrel-aged stout in my book.
O- I've had multiple vintages of BB Pt5 and it's among my favorite barrel-aged stouts. The base beer Pt5 is already a great beer and the barrels add a nice integrated presence adding to the complexity and flavor. From my experience I prefer this beer fresh as it's still incredibly drinkable and hasn't lost any of it's flavors. If you do want to age it a couple years it will still hold up with the best of them, except maybe lose a little bit of the base beer flavor. 1,409 charactersjaasen64, Apr 27, 2014

Wow... started on this site in may of 2013 and probably had a total of 50 beers craft and big brew before starting my journey into craft... number 500 is a good one...
Thanks Jas45678.... poured from bottle into Teku glass... split with a friend to give hime an opportunity to try a rare brew ..
Standard looking barrel aged stout. Black brown with a thin mocha colored head, not to watery, not like pouring oil. Nice ring left around, thin skin, sparse lacing and some legs as its swirlled around.
Smell was soft bourbon, chocolate, fudge, chocolate covered espresso bean, slight vanilla and toast, nice tobacco and dark fruits thrown in..
Taste was coffee fudge in the front, with a roast and malt taste coming thru with slight tobacco and vanilla. Bourbon is so sweet and delisious but its dialed back. Usually thats the first thing I pick up but this one is nice and subdued and plays a back up tole like it should. Slight toffee of butterscotch with a nice sweet finish and bitterness to compliment. 
Very nice feel from the brew. Not too heavy, not too sticky but definitely can call this one a barrel aged stout all day. Very light carnonation standard finish.
Overall I had high expectations for this brew and it didn't disappoint. I kind of knew it would be damn good and it was. The base beer was great and they complimented it with a good barrel addition that didn't take away but stood out on its own. Very pleased with this brew and glad I have more. 1,486 characterspjkelley82, Apr 25, 2014
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Really glad to finally get my hands on this one. Thanks, Tyler!
A: Pours a thick, viscous black with a thin mocha colored head that disappears into the body pretty quickly. Light on the lace, but it seems like the beer is just too heavy for it.
S: This isn't the most potent smelling barrel aged beer out there, but there is a ton going on in here. Upfront, you're met with rich dark chocolate, coconut and espresso. Beyond that, you get some toffee, marzipan, chocolate covered cherry and bourbon. Fantastic.
T: Dark chocolate with a bourbon bite right off the bat. Then settles into some roasted malt, espresso, toffee, light barrel char, and fudge. Finishes with some milk chocolate and a good dash of bourbon. A ton of aggressive flavors in here, but none of them really take charge, which is nice. Instead, they all meld together, held intact by a velvety and just a touch slick mouthfeel. Really well executed. 919 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 24, 2014

Upon its revival, utter decadence is realized!
You don't so much as pour the beer, rather you pop the cap and let it crawl out on its own. As it settles in the snifter, its lavish pitch-black body creeps to the bottom while a mocha-laden lather billows above. Its fledgling head character eventually succumbs to the beer's weight and renders it lacing as unimportant. What transpires instead in a shaddowy port or brandy appearance.
Its decadent dessert-like and boozy sweetness soothes the soul with a mere sip. Dark chocolate, espresso, creamy toffee-wrapped malt, walnut brownies and molasses round out the stouts surly scent. But a rise of bourbon happens as the beer warms, unlocking its sweet booziness with a soft pillow of caramel, vanilla, coconut and vinous cherry aroma.
Sipping as a cordial, the most subtle draw seeps into taste buds with sheer dominant roasty-sweet flavor. Coffeehouse espresso is softened with bittersweet chocolate, black-strap molasses and a creamy fudge flavor. As the stout slowly treks over the middle, its hearty sweetness slowly fades into a bitter coffee trail that's once again greeted with drunken oak. Its boozy char brings about a host of elegant power- its thin caramel is slightly of honey as the unmistakable coconut and vanilla offer the whimsy that only fine bourbon can. Even a savory vinous tone offers up sherry, port, merlot and even soy sauce.
Its full body simply laughs at any attempt for drinkability- this is a sipper as its enormous viscosity coats the mouth its oily chewiness. As its warm and toasted finish transpires, the stout retains much of its body, refusing to be dissected by its strong alcohols or its vinous tannin spiciness.
This special Plead the 5th doesn't pair with any after dinner dessert or snack. It is the after dinner dessert. Just sit back, relax and let this decadent ale steal your soul! 2,063 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 25, 2014

A- Pitch black, minimal head, light lacing, looks thick.
S- Could smell the vanilla bourbon as soon as I popped the top. Bourbon, sweet alcohol burn, vanilla, chocolate, roasted malt, slight espresso and toffee. 
T- Bourbon, dark roasted malt, vanilla, chocolate finish, and bitter coffee. So good. Like beautiful fudge bourbon. 
M- Rich and viscus. Lots of lingering flavors. Kinda hot at first but as it warms its as smooth as chocolate milk. Amazing.
O- One of my favorite BA stouts I've ever had. So rich and smooth, blended perfectly. I want this on my death bed. 623 charactersNCalement, Mar 24, 2014

S-The smell of bourbon is quite potent. Sweet chocolate and coffee with more woodiness and some vanilla. A high quality, textbook bourbon barreled stout. Really excited to try this one.
T-Rich, dark and milk chocolate. Smooth, potent coffee and a pronounced bourbon character. Vanilla, oak and straight up bourbon whiskey.
M-Full and creamy. Sneaky heat. Lower carbonation. Really agreeable feel. It sits and melts on your tongue.
O/D-A tasty, decadent barrel aged Imperial Stout. I understand why this has such a high rating and why it is so sought-after. It didn't blow my mind but I can't say I didn't enjoy it. 682 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 23, 2014

A - Pitch black, no lights getting through this bad boy
S - light bourbon notes on top of a roasted toffee aroma
T - The bourbon is there, but it's mild, but pleasant. Compiiments the other flavors well
M - Quite sticky, near perfect for this style
I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, but not quite the best barrel aged stout I've had. Definitely a worthy addition to the BA top 250, but not quite a top 25 beer in my opinion. But in the end, this beer is still excellent. Seek it out! 514 charactersKramerbarthomer, Mar 10, 2014

A - Dark and viscous with minimal head as with most BA beers. Solid lacing
S - Dark chocolate hints with vanilla smells, the barrel comes through on this with the always vanilla, oaky, earthy, roast balance coming through
T - Thick chocolate feel with amazing barrel character that is not overpowering. Dark fruits come through this towards the end on the back of the tongue with the vanilla, oak, and bourbon tastes shining through to create an amazing balance
M - Medium to full-bodied, a little thinner than most other stouts but with the high ABV i guess that can happen
O - I was definitely excited and hyped this beer up, it certainly was not a let down 728 charactersdrmcleod10, Mar 06, 2014

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5As my birthday arrives in a couple hours, I figured I'd scratch a top beer off the list, one I've been waiting to do for a while. This sits at #21 currently so relevant. 2011 vintage thanks to juliusseizure (Reddit). And this being a smaller bottle I can actually finish and enjoy it without needing a friend. I think the requires a fun review too.
Pours out like a midnight waterfall of black as black beer, light not even getting through the pour, but not thick as I expected, no motor oil in this one. A light fizzy super dark colored head forms like the dew attempting to form on a nice spring day, only to disappear like my paycheck after I visit the liquor store, never to be seen again, but typical for this high abv, a nice slick on the sides of the glass produces legs running from here to Arkansas.
Nose is about what I expected, a glass of disappointme... wait no not that, glass of awesomeness! It has all the characters of a great barrel aged imperial stout with a few years under it's belt. No alcohol at all, not even a whisp, nice dark chocolate but not overly fudgey or cocoa like, a good baker's chocolate perhaps from a good version of Hershey's (cause Dark Horse is also from PA, get it... eh nevermind). It also brings a nice layered soft aged malt like a big aged barleywine or old ale would do, but this time in stout form! Malts, form of Stout! Roast, attempting to roast it up, but just mellows out like it matured nicely. And barrel, that good old vanilla barrel, with a mild bourbon note, just wish the bourbon was abit more for an old bourbon fanatic such as myself.
Taste is loaded with anticipation, wait that's what I have before I sip it. I spit it out, well not me, the glass spit it into my mouth and it was delicious. Again that huge layered soft aged malt kicks ass, that old ale stout hybrid shizzle. Then more dutch chocolate, little fudgey and very thick, cocoa infested for sure, with a nice tongue tickling luscious velour chocolate flavor, not quite Choc Rain level but very nice regardless. Again that roasty and super dark malt character wants to just smash my mouth, but aging to the rescue! The 3 years just smacks the want to be super roasty soy sauce and shows it a thing or two, and now it's delicious, and even hints at roasted coffee. A layer of caramel nudges through, as well as a little fluffy chocolateized nougat, a bit airy too. A hint of bitterness I think, or perception of it. Barrel also comes into play a bit but not as much as I'd like. Probably the one thing that the aging process screwed over, the nice barrel, but I end up with a bit of a nice vanilla and hint of bourbon notes in the background. Finish is drier but a little mouth coating feel, layered fudgey choc, and more cocoa vanilla and pure deliciousness lingering.
Mouth is thick, rich, velvety and creamy, velour! with decent carb for the age and style, and the faintest hint of booze somewhere in teh background just slightly nagging at me like an ant crawling on my leg.
Overall, just one word, YES! 3,033 charactersjlindros, Mar 02, 2014

Pours oil black with a tiny eighth finger cap of tan head. Very little retention and no lace. 
Sweet, inviting aromas of bourbon, vanilla, cocoa and caramel. Nice. 
Taste follows the nose but so much better. Flavors of soft, sweet bourbon throughout with layers of dark chocolate, vanilla, roasty malts, oak, molasses, caramel and espresso. Terrific balance of bourbon and classic imperial stout. A slight tingle of alcohol but this goes down easily. 
Creamy, medium full feel with low carbonation. Perhaps not quite as thick as I'd prefer but it settles on the tongue nicely. Aftertaste of soft bourbon and bittersweet dark chocolate. 
I've enjoyed Plead the 5th before but nothing like this. The barrel aging really makes this beer come alive. An excellent treat that is worth seeking out. 979 charactersThickNStout, Feb 26, 2014

A- Pours an oily black, opaque body with a modest mocha colored head that reduces slowly and leaves blotchy lacing. 
S- Very inviting and upfront on the nose.. creamy vanilla and milk chocolate, soft bourbon, caramel, burnt marshmallows. 
T- Wow.. this is amazing.. sweet vanilla and molasses, whiskey and milk chocolate upfront. The follow through is burnt coffee and dark chocolate. The finish leaves a delectable charred, nearly burn malt taste on the tongue. Very complex, very balanced. 
M- Creamy and easy to drink. Rich, full of flavor. Low carbonation. 
One of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts I've ever had, this one has the upper hand most others due to it's smooth, creamy, balanced character and rich, bold flavor. 811 charactersgcamparone, Feb 25, 2014
4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours a pitch black with a whispy mocha head. Decent lacing. Looks the part.
Smell is bourbon, bittersweet chocolate, and sweet vanilla.
Taste is bourbon upfront followed by roasted and chocolate notes. Ends with a bit of sweetness. Not cloying or anything. Bourbon is well integrated and is prominent without being overwhelming. Reminds me a good deal of BCBS. 
Mouthfeel is very smooth and well done for the style. Not quite as good as, say, BCBS or FIS but it is at least in the same ballpark. Full and velvety without feeling hard to drink.
Overall this is a really well done example of the style. If I could get it with some degree of ease I would do so regularly. 673 charactersmechamifune, Feb 24, 2014

The aroma is absolutely decadent with strong milk chocolate and creamy vanilla but I catch some dried fruit. Touches of raisin and prune mix with the barrel and bourbon to finish a delightful nose.
The flavor is creamy, milky, with lactose-sweetness and vanilla. The bourbon is very present on the tongue as some of the oak and woodsy properties finish it off.
The feel is warm and creamy, a little thinner than anticipated, with a bit of bourbon tang.
This is strangely different than the regular Plead the Fifth as the barrel has truly transformed the flavors to a creamy, vanilla dessert beer. 700 charactersKYGunner, Feb 23, 2014

Pours a dark used motor oil brown capped by a creamy one finger beige head. Excellent retention especially for a barrel-aged stout; light, splotchy lacing. Dark chocolate, dried dark fruit, oak, and bourbon on the nose. An explosion of flavor: dense dark chocolate, scorched malt, dried black cherries, hints of prune and raisin, mild vanilla, charred oak, all capped off by charred oak and pleasant, warming bourbon booziness. Full bodied, low carbonation. Ridiculously smooth, creamy and velvety mouthfeel; as close to perfect as possible. One of the most balanced barrel aged imperial stouts I've ever enjoyed. This brew is a true marvel year in and year out. 710 characterschanokokoro, Feb 22, 2014

A- Love the look of this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Great Lakes snifter/tulip and got a finger of a rich mocha head. Fades to a centimeter of foam. Pretty good retention, especially for a BA stout of this magnitude. Absolutely no light getting through. As black as Taye Diggs. Love it.
S- This has a really complex nose. So many scents to discern. Of course, there is bourbon. Tannins and vanillins. Bakers chocolate. Dark chocolate. Some caramel. Definitely retained some roast, which is awesome. Oatmeal. Great nose. Could only ask for a little more bourbon, though it does come out more as it warms. 
T- Oh my stars, this is rich. I'm enamored. Such great balance between the bourbon, chocolate, and roast. This is what I love in a BA stout. Sweet and roasty with a hint of booze. Such well integrated flavors. Chocolate and bourbon hit you first, and the roast comes mid-palate and lingers with the warmth of the alcohol. This is fantastic. The 11% isn't overwhelmingly obvious, but you know it's there. 
M- Not the most viscous BA stout I've had (that honor goes to BA D.O.R.I.S.), but this is a smooth, thick beer. More carbonation than most BA stouts, but it's not offensive. Well done.
O- I've become, instantly, a fan of this beer. There is a great deal of balance, and all of it's flavors are so well integrated. The only thing I could ask for is a tad more influence from the barrel. Just a TAD. Other than that, this beer is spot on. Good thing I have four left. Gonna see what time does to this beast.

A - Deep black with no light coming through and very little head. Looks like a glass of motor oil.
S - Bourbon, vanilla, oak and a hint of molasses. Gets better and better as it warms.
T - Lots of bourbon! It hits hard on the first sip but the palate adjusts quickly. It's got great depth and richness with a moderate bitterness in the finish. The alcohol is pretty apparent. This is a big bold beer.
M - Thick and creamy. The carbonation is there but very much in the background.
O - The bourbon might be a bit too dominant but it was still a special beer. 618 charactersGJ40, Feb 09, 2014

Layers upon layers of scents... Coffee, dark roasted. Vanilla, oak, blackstrap molasses, cola. 
One of the best tasting bb stouts I can recall. The bourbon barrel pulls great bourbon qualities without being too boozy. Vanilla, oak, cinnamon, and even a light nutty quality. Coffee, anise, molasses. Incredibly complex and intermingled. Long finish of heavily roasted malt. 
Phenomenal mouthfeel. Hefty, creamy, smooth. There's no mistaking it for a bb stout but it's surprisingly drinkable. 
It's my first time trying this out and it instantly moves into the discussion of all time favorites. A superb beer that's found the right integration of the barrel.

pours jet black, pretty decent viscosity. little to no head. appears pretty still. 
very bourbon forward, alcohol infused stout paired with bitter dark chocolate
similar to nose, very alcohol forward. has a lot of Jack Daniels flavors popping out up front. the base is a bit subdued but deep in there is a sweet roasted body. 
very moderate carbonation mixed with the alcohol, you get some bite. this has some bite. 
good BA stout, maybe needs some time? this is a tad rough on the edges. i am grateful for finally being able to try this thanks to a generous BA. 599 charactershooliganlife, Jan 28, 2014

Aroma is heavy bourbon, molasses, bitter dark bakers chocolate, fudge, brown sugar, and a definite date and fig fruitiness.
The taste brings heavy roast, bourbon, molasses, fudge, brown sugar, burnt fig, oak, vanilla extract, and bitter coffee. The flavor is pretty balanced between the roast, sweetness, fruitiness, and booziness of the bourbon. The finish lacks the complexity of the mid palate though.
Mouthfeel suffers a bit compared to the rest of the beer but is still good. More fullness would be awesome but the carbonation is spot on for the style. A medium mouthfeel when it should be at least a heavy side of medium.
Overall an excellent bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Not at the level of some of the best I've had, but definitely on their heels. Will be interesting to see how it ages. 997 charactersMarcWP, Jan 21, 2014

Pours a beautiful velvety black into matching snifters. Nice mocha-colored head lasts for about 15 minutes.
Smells great- dark malt, cocoa, oak, and well-integrated bourbon.
Tastes even better. All of the above smells are amplified. This is one of the best barrel-aged stouts I've ever had. Dark Horse really knew what they were doing here. The roasty bitterness of the dark malt intermingles so well with the sweet, leathery, oaky bourbon flavors. Awesome!
Pretty sticky and viscous mouthfeel. Goes down so easy. Well carbonated.
Awesome BA stout. Don't let the slightly amateur label job fool you- this stout is great. More and more people know about this winner of a beer- so it's no longer a "dark horse." 773 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 16, 2014

Note that as of this writing I have not tried the regular Plead the 5th yet, but I intend to crack it open eventually. Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a snifter.
As expected, pours a thick syrup of a stout, with a treacle-like consistency that appears to end as sludge into the glass, save for some minor mocha-colored foam that shows yet gently dissipates throughout the course of consumption. Super viscous, oily, and resinous if I ever saw a stout of this caliber before - my favorite part was the tremendous amount of scattered shrapnel lacing that coated all sides of the glass every time that I would give this a good swirl. Normally extremely syrupy looking RIS offerings are not my favorite, but this one contains a bit of prowess and charm overall in its liqueur like properties. Very memorably intimidating.
Wow! That's an extremely sweet bourbon aged stout, but for reasons you'd perhaps least expect. Yes, there's some classic bourbon sweet notes of toffee, vanilla, and cinnamon at the back, but the front is chock filled with the sweetness of caramel soaked dark cherries, blackcurrant, and figs, as well as obvious notes of roasted chocolate, coffee, and molasses. Impressive barrel spices and non-fruit make up the mid flavor, releasing notes of licorice, tobacco, leather, and violets throughout. Very stimulating stuff, with the only major drawback being the high presence of booze throughout, notably stinging the nostrils at every whiff. Sweet, but pretty restrained. Still extremely complex and memorable, as this kinds of beers must be.
I expected a boozy, sweet, barrel laden RIS from the aroma, but instead after my first sip I came across, to my knowledge, the most balanced and perhaps easy-going offering of its kind. It's a big beer, no doubt, but doesn't make that clear throughout. Vivid, rich notes of fudge, chocolate nibs, caramel, and molasses sugar coat dark fruit notes (mainly of dark cherries and prunes) as the beer soon melts with many of the barrel spices mentioned earlier. Vanilla and toffee are obvious, but tobacco, leather, and pepper are also very present. Earthy and roasted, with some sweetness and fruitiness that makes it feel robust in character. Finishes medium-bodied, with a dry, bready flavor awash with spices and sweetness that cleanse the palate overall. Stupidly balanced, as far as the style goes - this provides the drinker with all the best aspects within it without one of them overpowering the other. If it weren't for the high booze, I could certainly have more of this in one evening.
This is an amazing beer, and absolutely worth checking out, but I enjoyed it for many surprisingly different reasons from what I'd initially heard. It's rich, robust, and contains all of the barrel characteristics I enjoy best in these beers, but it doesn't smack you upside the head doing it, which I enjoy. No clue how this would age, but it's pretty extraordinary fresh. Don't go too much out of your way to get some, but all fans of the style should have it at least once. 3,097 charactersmagictacosinus, Jan 14, 2014

Pours jet black with a super thin, mocha head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the glass. Good lacing. Complex aromas of vanilla, raisin, bourbon, molasses, and dark chocolate. This is one of the best BA stouts I've ever smelled! Smooth dark chocolate hits the front of the palate followed by caramel,vanilla, and dark fruits. The bourbon isn't as pronounced as in other BA stouts and it's extremely smooth and mellow. As it warms the chocolate really comes out with hints of toffee and molasses. Finish is chocolate with a hint of bourbon heat. Full bodied and incredibly smooth. Not much carbonation to speak of. Sweet finish. Overall, this is the best example of a bourbon barrel stout I've yet had. Simply outstanding! 766 charactersJohnG190, Jan 12, 2014

A: Pours a mostly still, oily, opaque black with some evidence of carbonation but little head.
S: Big notes of bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Hints of dark fruit and cherries and leather. A slight buttery oak character is evident and gets stronger as it warms. The base stout isn't too evident in the aroma, but a definite sweetness and roastiness are underlying the stronger aromas. 
T/M: This is a delicious and complex beer -- much nicer than the aroma. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla dominate up front, and then the base stout's coffee and chocolate arrive as the bourbon steps back a bit. Sweetness is provided by the malt as both chocolate and dark fruit flavors. The finish is smooth and mostly barrel character with a slight lingering coffee bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and oily with light carbonation.
O: This is a great bourbon barrel aged stout. The buttery oak character in the aroma is slightly offputting, but the taste of this beer really makes up for it. I can't say that this is objectively better than regular Plead the 5th, which I love, but I definitely like this beer and am stoked that it comes in 12oz bottles. 1,210 charactersjdhowe, Jan 12, 2014

A- Pours near pitch black with a nice cream colored head.

Reviewed live. 2011 vintage. Reviewed as an imperial stout because the label identifies it as such. Expectations are sky-high; I loved the regular Plead the 5th.
Served cold - straight from the fridge - and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.
Pours a half finger wide head of great khaki colour. Fantastic mocha-like creaminess. Great thickness. Sadly, the head retention is quite poor - maybe 25 seconds at best. Uneven spotty lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.
Body colour is a solid opaque dark black. No yeast particles/sediment is visible. 
Overall, it's looking real good for an imperial stout, but is far from unique or special. I've seen much better in the style, especially inasmuch as the head is concerned.
Sm: Chocolate malts, dark malts, cream, and complementary bourbon notes - some rich vanilla and pleasant guiding oak. It's not as toasty or roasty as would be ideal. The coffee has also faded substantially, but there's some vague cappuccino. Caramel. 
It's a pleasant aroma of mild strength. To be honest, I expected more complexity and subtlety from the aroma. 
No hop character or yeast character is detectable. It's quite clean.
T: I dig the bourbon; the vanilla and oak are nice, but I do want some toasty character from it. Dark malts and chocolate malts provide the foundation, with some sparse coffee/cappuccino in there too. Cream. Caramel. I'm not finding much (if any) roasted barley. It's a well balanced build, but while cohesive isn't quite gestalt. The barrel notes are well integrated into the base, but it doesn't feel like a perfect marriage. Good complexity and some nice subtlety. Not particularly nuanced or intricate. It's a bit too ashy and burnt on the climax, which is joined unfavorably by an unbecoming coffee-like bitterness.
It's certainly on the sweeter side. 
Mf: I love the creaminess. Smooth. Wet. Has an even consistency. Well-carbonated. Good thickness and body. Good presence on the palate.
Not oily, astringent, harsh, gushed, hot, or boozy.
Dr: I'm not sure if age has really helped it, but it's a tasty imperial stout. I'm glad I got to try it, but it's not amongst the best in the style. I'd pick it up if I saw it on the shelf, sure, but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out. I'd like to try it fresh. Hides its ABV pretty well. Damn good, but not world class. Quite drinkable, though.

A- Half jet black, half dark roasty brown. Little to no carbonation. Thinnest of thin lacing around the glass. 
S- Great coffee notes. I am getting malty notes. I feel like I may have a bottle that is not up to par. I have had the two previous years that tasted/smelled better. The lack of carbonation makes me wonder. 
T- Pretty coffee forward with mellowed bourbon note for this fresh '13. 
M- On the thin side for me for a BA stout, but still pretty good.

A - Very dark brown that lightens around the edge of the glass. Thin oak brown head that doesn't stay long. No collar or lacing on my glass. 
S - Bitter chocolate and slight char/smoke from the base stout. Nice notes of sweet bourbon, caramel, and vanilla blend nicely with the stout. 
T - The base stout is very flavorful and not overtaken by the barrel. Bitter chocolate and a bit of char from the dark roasted malts. Sweet notes of bourbon, caramel, and vanilla liven as the beer warms. Excellent!
M - Medium bodied - a bit slick and smooth. I thought it would be a bit fuller with some chewiness, but this is pretty good for a stout.
O - I have had Pt5 and was intrigued by what barrel aging would bring to it. It really adds an element of sweetness to the bitter stout. I recommend trying this beer. I will age the few I have left and see what it is like in a year or so. 921 charactersRi0, Dec 29, 2013

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5This was the very first beer I traded for, 1 yr ago, just after the 4 elf party. I told myself I would age it for a year then drink it and compare it to the newest batch fresh. 12 oz bottle poured into a Half Acre snifter, served chilled to 40 and allowed to warm.
Appearance: Pours a deep deep dark brown akin to motor oil. Head is thin and dark tan with varying sizes of bubbles. Fades fairly quickly into rimming around the side of the glass.
Smell: Age has not made the barrel character fade away in the nose. Bourbon is present but a good amount of oaky, toffee, and vanilla. Chocolate and roasty malts similar to the base beer are present as well. 
Taste: The bitter roasty chocolate base beer is forefront. Bourbon again is present but not strong. Vanilla and toffee add sweetness. A substantial amount of bitterness throughout. Remarkably not very boozy for 11%. Dark chocolate and cacao linger on the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is low-medium, body is heavy and full, finish is sticky and dry. Not the ultimate in chewy mouthfeels but pretty close.
Overall, I really enjoy the base beer of plead the fifth, and while this is fantastic, I had imagined it might be just a little better. I am intrigued now to try this fresh and compare. I don't think this would benefit from further aging as it is very drinkable and far from hot. If anything, the barrel character might just be more subdued than I would appreciate, and thus perhaps it is better fresh. Regardless, a real treat to drink. 1,507 charactersMCain04, Dec 06, 2013

4.64/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A- Pours a viscous black with a finger of mocha head that slowly recedes to a film. No lacing is left on the glass.
S- Smells of sweet molasses, dark roasted malts, charred oak, vanilla from the bourbon, and figs/dates. There are also hints of coffee and booze. Really smells wonderful!
T- The flavor opens sweet, with molasses, chocolate, and candied figs and dates. This gives way to tons of bitter roast/coffee, bitter baker's chocolate, vanilla, and charred oak. There's also a bit of a dry, vinous bite on the back of the tongue in the finish. It's very impressive how this brew toys with being cloyingly sweet and then excessively bitter, but manages to use this to stay balanced. A bit of the bourbon comes through, but a little more would make this almost perfect. 
M- The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, coating the tongue, with just enough carbonation. Only a mild amount of boozy heat comes through, which is impressive considering the 14% abv.
O- Overall I am thoroughly impressed with this beer! I love more roasty/coffee forward stouts, and this delivers, while adding sweet and charred flavors from the barrel! 1,129 charactersSadMachine, Dec 06, 2013

Appearence is opaque black with that signature chocolate milky head...its always a serious affair with this brew...
Nose has a surprisingly noticeable amt of alcohol considering this bottle has almost a year on it...this is followed by smooth notes of roasty dark chocolatish malts that suggest the beer has smoothed out...
Yup...this is indeed the case...taste is tremendously smooth with extremely complex notes of dark flavors I simply cannot begin to describe accurately...that makes this very high abv beer very dangerous so use good judgement and proceed with caution...no question that a lil time on this beer creates a masterpiece however the full flavored nature of the fresh bottles are not to be ignored either...
Mouthfeel is top notch velvety smooth and without a hint of chalkiness as sometimes happens with bottles of this style...
Overall a must try...I personally consider it one of the best RIS available...of course it helps that I live an hour away from the brewery...a perfect stout night for me includes Black Note, BCBS, KBS, and good ol' BBPlead from Dark Horse... 1,260 charactersMichiBrew, Dec 03, 2013

Review #850
Super viscous with a dark brown/black, motor oil-like appearance. There was no head but merely a frothy mass of saddle brown bubbles atop the liquid. The bubbles quickly dissipated to a thin ringlet.
Bourbon notes dominated in the aroma. Super fragrant and boozy. Loads of vanilla. Deep, dark, roasty and smoky malts came through strong. Good amount of wood and ash. Slightly sweet with caramel and brown sugar notes. Touch of coffee and semi-sweet chocolate. As the beer warmed, more sweetness came forth to balance things out. 
The flavor profile was very similar to the nose. Super rich and robust. Tons of bourbon and fresh vanilla bean. Lots of roasted malt, caramel and barrel character. Notes of charred wood and ash were apparent. Good dose of espresso and bakers chocolate. Hints of dark fruits (prunes and raisins) came through as well. The finish was bitter, ashy and quite hot with a whiskey-like burn. Like the nose, the flavor profile mellowed out with time.
The mouthfeel was really intense. Chewy and almost milk shake-like. Rich and oily with a fine, plush, supple effervescence. Velvety smooth on the palate. After each sip, the liquid left a sticky film on my lips.
Dark Horse Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th Imperial Stout is an unapologetically bourbon-forward beer that some (myself included) might describe as being a bit rough around the edges. Although the booziness and the charred malts were at times distracting, the many amazing aspects of this beer made up for these relative shortcomings. 1,651 charactersDamian, Nov 18, 2013

Nearly jet black, ring of tan head with no lace to speak of. Smell an incredible mix of bourbon, oak and roast, lots of vanilla and chocolate, a bit of coconut, coffee grinds and a bit of alcohol, similar to BCBS in the nose. Taste is bourbon and oak, coconut, vanilla, chocolate, fudge and a light sweetness, roasted malt with some dry coffee in the finish. Lightly carbonated, medium-full body. Incerdibly solid, up there with some of the better BA stouts, will actively seek out more of this stuff. 538 characterspeensteen, Nov 07, 2013

Pours graciously with no apparent head until I force the last on the bottle straight down. Head is a crown of caramel bubbles which settle along the edges of my snifter. The smell is dark chocolate, coffee, burnt vanilla and a musty bourbon. Despite the variety of flavors, everything seems somewhat muted. I appreciate the aggressive (but well integrated) taste of bourbon in an aged stout, but that isn't the case here. I'm just a bit disappointed, and as it warms I get a bit more bourbon, though not as well integrated and a bit fusel. The taste is something I can appreciate. It's smooth and mellow. No alcohol burn, and a nice roastiness. Mouthfeel is silky but a tad thin. My bottle says its 11% despite the description saying it should be 14%. I attribute the thinness to this. This may have been a thicker beer, but this version is definitely a lot lighter on the tongue. Overall, I'm happy to try this. I am starting to realize rarity can elevate a beers score, but in this case the beer gets the job done and I am more than happy to enjoy it. Cheers. 1,119 charactersPlinyBeMiney, Oct 21, 2013

Pours dark black with a 1/4 inch mocha head which fades quickly. Has a very nice sweet aroma with chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon, raisins, figs, coconut, oak, and vanilla. Even though I can clearly smell the bourbon, it does not have a boozy smell to it.
Tastes as great as it smells. Sweet with chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon, raisins, figs, coconut, oak, and vanilla. Just like with the aroma, the taste is not boozy, even though I can taste the bourbon. This aged the perfect amount of time to turn out this nice. 
For some reason, the Plead the 5th base beer tastes boozier than this version. I may need to buy some more of the base beer, and age for a couple of years to compare.
Medium to full bodied with light carbonation. Has a chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon aftertaste. This is a very well made beer. I'm very glad to have a few more bottles to drink. 883 charactershardy008, Oct 15, 2013

When I first had this beer many moons ago, even in the midst of other harder-than-usual-to-come-by barrel-aged stouts and such, I felt lucky as hell to have had the privilege of its acquaintanceship. Then I was given a second chance. Pinch me. Anyway, this stuff pours a bedevilingly dark and murky black-brown topped by a short finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises bourbon, roasted malts, dark chocolate powder, light wood, a touch of booze, and the faintest hint of vanilla bean. The taste brings in more of the same, everything colluding to effect a luscious melange of bourbon-y, chocolate-y, and roast-y tastiness. The body is a light hefty, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, this is still one of the best barrel-aged stouts I've ever come across. Perhaps the beer gods will smile on me again in the future...? 886 charactersTMoney2591, Sep 28, 2013

And epic is the word to describe this, it's a hell of a BBA stout. Vanilla up front yields to a huge of bourbon flavor, but doesn't choke out the big, complex fruit character that rides with the normal imperial stout roast/coffee/chocolate thing in the back. Very big and smooth mouthfeel, a great BBA stout. 395 charactersshand, Sep 28, 2013

The beer pours a deep, thick, black color, great motor oil texture with a thick, dense, khaki head that has very good retention and leaves some nice sticky lace behind. The aroma is beautiful, tons of bourbon and barrel character, rich toffee, boisterous chewy, charred oak, chocolate, pitted stone fruit and a little licorice and molasses creep through at the end. The flavors are right in line, wonderful barrel presence, lots of oak, char, soft bourbon, sweet toffee, bitter dark chocolate, plum, fig and cherry pits, light licorice and a touch of warm alcohol and strap molasses are known at the finish. The body is wonderful, luscious, silky, rich, full bodied, coats the mouth well, carbonation is perfect, low on the spectrum, but it makes the beer so great, the finish is warm, soft and delightful.
Verdict: A darn delicious bourbon barrel stout, the flavor profile is perfect, the amount of fruit and complexity is mind boggling. One of the most impressive bourbon barrel stouts on the market and the showcase of the Dark Horse line up, if not the showcase of the Great Lakes. 1,168 characterskevanb, Sep 27, 2013

A - Pours with a thick and oily appearance as it enters the glass. Pitch black in color with almost not head formation that really only results in a thin dark brown collar and no lacing.
S - Sweet on the nose with molasses and dark caramelized sugar, brown sugar, chocolate, some anise and some boozy bourbon. As it warms in the glass a bit, I get some sugar cookies, light butter and some vanilla.
T - Bourbon up front that puts a tingle on the lips and tongue immediately. Chocolate, molasses, a bit of char, dark roasted malts and hints of coffee. Not as sweet as the aroma would indicate. Coffee comes on more on the back end of each sip and eventually leaves a long lingering flavor past the swallow. Bourbon smoothes out as the beer warms too and a smooth vanilla kicks up a notch as well.
M - Thick and full bodied - a bit slick and oily. Sweet with bourbon flavors and bitter and roasty blending together quite well to give an excellent overall balance. The thickness is great yielding a luxurious soft feel.
O - Overall, very nice BA imperial stout. I like this quite a bit more than the standard version and actually think this is a smoother drinker even with the addition of somewhat boozy bourbon. Alcohol is noticeable throughout but isn't at all harsh and burning, just a very desirable warmth. Barrel works well to add some extra nuance in the flavor and aroma. One of the better BA beers out there. 1,478 charactersportia99, Sep 21, 2013

Pours a pitch black with minimal head and lacing. Very thick and viscous. 
On the nose is bourbon and dark fruits. Lots of oak. Some hints of vanilla as well. Maybe a bit of bitter coffee and some bittersweet chocolate. 
Taste is bitter chocolate and bourbon. Being that the beer is almost three years old I think it may have given the bourbon time to die down, which I like. Some beers really overdo the bourbon. No real alcohol presence either but it's still a sipper. Dark fruits begin to come through in the middle as well as the oak. Very complex as the coffee hits towards the finish. 
Mouthfeel is big and chewy. Very rich. Not as thick as BCBS but thicker than KBS. 
Very very good BA stout. Would drink again for sure. Curious to see how it tastes fresh. 781 charactersdowen17, Sep 18, 2013

S: Smells of heaven. Anise, Black Licorice, Chocolate, Coffee, fudge, roast and a solid amount of bourbon.
T: Tastes like heaven. Nearly spot on the nose. Huge amounts of coffee, chocolate and a perfectly balanced amount of bourbon.
M: Medium to full body. Medium carbonation. The beer comes off thick yet slick and creamy on your tongue. This beer is ridiculously drinkable. Moderate amounts of bourbon reminds you, you are drinking an BBA Imperial stout.
O: This is the pinnacle of BBA Imperial Stouts. Everyone does them differently and they all taste a tad bit different, but this one, this one is perfectly balanced. Just the right amount of fudgey goodness paired with just right amount of barrel from the bourbon makes this beer ridiculously easy to drink . If you can't make it to 4elf, i'll let you in on a secret. Hit the brewery any time of the year and pay the money for the tour, you won't be disappointed. 1,041 charactersWesM63, Aug 30, 2013

 Poured jet-black, inky into tulip with a one finger tan head. Big bourbon nose with hints of chocolate. Taste follows nose rich, well-balanced bourbony sipper with traces of chocolate and maybe cherries...very smooth. Surprisingly full-bodied for its fluidity. Very enjoyable 289 charactersWillieThreebiers, Aug 22, 2013

Because I only got to have 4 ounces and because you try so many different beers at this festival, it is tough for me to give this the review it deserves but here it goes...
Bourbon seemed to be the dominant taste in this beer. It was overpowering but enough so that it did mask some of the other stout flavors I usually like to find. From reading some other reviews on this site, I am sure that if I had let this beer warm a bit some of the other flavors would have come out.
I am slowly starting to appreciate Dark Horse as I have started to have more of their beers. When comparing other big stouts that I had during the day at Great Taste, this was for sure one of the top 3. 735 charactersmjpolzin, Aug 11, 2013

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had two 4oz pours of this beer at the Great Taste. The first pour was so good as it warmed up that I had to go back and get more. I should honestly not be reviewing this beer despite having 8oz- but just keep in mind that I intend this to be for my own personal records. YMMV.
The beer is a viscous, very dark black looking beer that came with a small dark brown head that disappeared fairly quickly. Looks to be par for the course for a nice barrel-aged stout. Not much film, not much collar, not much lacing to be found.
The beer smells fairly tame out of the tap. You get a little bit of dark chocolate and roast malts. Starts out nothing special but it really evolves into something amazing when it gets warmed up (which after 5 minutes out in that 80 degree temperature and in the sun at the GTMW was enough), it becomes a full blown roasty malt and chocolate+vanilla bomb. You can smell a bit of oak, but it was dominated by the roast malts and the chocolatey vanilla combination. It was great.
The taste is the same as the nose- it was disappointingly tame when it was cold but after it warmed up, it became something really special. So much vanilla, roasty malts and dark chocolate sweetness with a bit of coffee bitterness to balance everything out. It was great, honestly the best part of the beer.
The feel on this one is full bodied, very thick and resinous. It's so easy drinking for such a big beer. Aftertaste is so much of that sweet roast malt with some sweet bourbon flavour in the back. Not a lot of booze here either, which is fantastic.
Great beer, I would have gone back for more but my friends told me there was other beer at this festival. Oops. I really enjoyed this one, and I would have to say its comparable to Black Note, and beats BCBS by a decent bit because its just not as boozy. 1,817 charactersStevedore, Aug 11, 2013

Appearance: Inky black with a wispy tan head. Small amount of tan lacing.
Smell: Bourbon and roasted malts, a bit of coffee.
Taste: Bourbon bomb. Coffee, nutty, sweet, vanilla, chocolate, oak all there. Lot of heat coming off this guy from the alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Thick and full-bodied. Adequate carb.
Drinkability: A real sipper. Alcohol and heat are high.
Overall: Excellent bourbon stout, but could stand to get a bit of age for the heat to die down. 552 characterscbeer88, Jul 07, 2013

it is dark and not much head just like regular
although this smell is boozy maybe hint of chocolate on back end 
and taste is similar although is extremely smooth maybe a touch of heat
slight lacing on this also
aftertaste is so good almost perfect would prefer this over the regular although both are amazing brews 426 charactersmhksuccess, Jul 02, 2013

A - Pours a deep dark black body with little to no dark tan head. No light going through this one
S - A lot of vanilla and oak up front followed by dark fruit, mainly cherry with some chocolate notes mixed in
T- Follows the nose with great bourbon notes in the fruit and chocolate combo
M - Nice full body with ample coating, really a smooth drinker
O - Was really impressed by this one. Enjoyed the vanilla and fruit combo the entire sitting. I wish I had a few more of these to enjoy down road, really great stuff here! 567 characterslangchops, Jun 28, 2013

Appearance: Pours pitch black, with some brownish highlights on the edge; the head lays a film on top of the liquid and then fades to a ringlet while leaving a nice pattern of lacing around the chalice
Smell: Dark fruit, licorice, dark chocolate, citrus and some oak; not picking up much in the way of Bourbon
Taste: The dark fruit (prune, primarily), licorice and dark chocolate flavors dominate the front end with some citrusy hops appearing, in the middle; the Bourbon appears, after the swallow, adding oak and vanilla; chops more wood into the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, with low to moderate carbonation; some warmth in the gullet
Overall: For what is currently #19 on the Top 250 list, I was expecting something a bit more than what I got; still, this beer is a solid Bourbon barrel RIS, just not an earth shatterer

12oz. Bottle poured into a Huna snifter, 2012 vintage. Poured along-side a 2013 Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout and a 2013 KBS as part of a side-by-side tasting.
Appearance: Dark brown almost black with very little head that quickly dissipates to a small ring.
Smell: Roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and a sweetness that is like black licorice. Very nice and complex mixture of aromas.
Taste: This is one complex beer, the black licorice and molasses flavors meld very well with the mocha flavors from the malt. Next, you can taste the vanilla and the bourbon, just and incredible diversity of flavor very rich and very, very, delicious. The alcohol is completely masked.
Mouthfeel: Very creamy and smooth yet clean on the palate.
Overall: An exceptional BA stout in every way, very happy I had the chance to try this one. 917 charactersBobZ, Jun 16, 2013

A- Jet black with a little bit of carbonation at the end of pour. The head is thin and tan but the retention is beautiful. This is a 100 percent perfect looking bb stout.
S- There is bourbon, roasty notes, oak and a slight damp funk at the end. Not quite what I was hoping for and not what I remember.
T- I dont pick up any funk like I did on the nose, but again slightly dissappointing. I get dark fruits, a little bitter chocolate, a little bourbon, but it has a light finish with red wine characters. A little astringent. 
M- Starts off slightly syrupy but finishes pretty light and moderate carbonation.
O- To be honest this beer isn't quite what I remember it being. I am going to sit on my other too and hope they mellow out and evolve a little bit. 786 charactersPerHops, Jun 12, 2013

The stout had a mild bourbon aroma with malts lingering in the background. For a 14%ABV, I was anticipating a stronger bourbon aroma. In the initial taste, I detected vanilla, malt, bitter dark chocolate, burnt malts, and perhaps dark fruits. However, the taste just seems to end there with malts. There is a warming nature to the aftertaste, which one might find quite pleasant. In terms of taste, I just do not think this beer finished well. The thickness of the mouthfeel allow a sort of vacuum of malt which led to nothing more. For such a bold style, I expected more taste, and it just was not there. 788 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jun 08, 2013
4.14/5  rDev -7.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4Pours a dark brown, motor oil color with some tan lacing. The aroma leaves something to be desired. Although the normal constituents of bourbon are present on the nose (i.e. vanilla, oak, etc.). There's a faint "saltwater" aroma as well, which is a little disconcerting. The taste follows the standard bourbon profile, with big burned elements and a heavy alcohol warmth throughout. The mouthfeel is pleasant, although I wish it was slightly thicker. The finish leaves something to be desired, as the big flavors from the initial taste disappear rather quickly, leaving only the burn. A solid brew from Dark Horse, but I'm a little let down. 641 characterstbdkev, Jun 07, 2013

4.27/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42012 bottle from Jim M. Thanks! Poured into my LA Teku. 
A: Pours in an inky, almost treacly manner to the glass. Fills up with a solid dark mocha head which fades quickly. Some carbonation bubbles are disturbing the surface of this black puddle. Legs are thick, thick, thick. 
N: Hearty bourbon with a big chocolate and espresso background. Vanilla and caramel and oak. Coconut and more fudge. Brown sugar and some molasses. Big sweet sugars here. Some rye and oatmeal. 
T: Very, very sweet. Bourbon appropriates the top level here and adds a sweet sting on top of a very pronounced sweet malt body. There’s a little bit of earth, pine and spice from what I assume are the hops and there’s some additional roast. This has some surprising balance, though it’s still a heavy confection. Does have a salty soy sauce aspect. 
M: Super boozy, but it’s got a wonderfully filling mouthfeel. Other RIS’s should pay attention to this aspect, it’s the best I’ve had outside Apple Brandy Hunahpu’s. 
O: I wish I had split this bottle because it’s absolutely going to sit in my stomach, but at the same time, I don’t think I’m going to get sick of it. This might get a few more points if it turned down the bourbon heat, but at the same time, it’s done an excellent job of making both the bourbon and the stout distinct, so what else can you want? 1,365 charactersSarlacc83, May 17, 2013

A- Poured dark and thick, black in color. Barely any head or noticeable carbonation. Dark brown lacing.
S- Bourbon, vanilla, coconut, some booze on the nose as well. The smell is sweet, I don't get as much chocolate or bitterness that I got when I had this fresh. The aroma is mostly bourbon and vanilla.
T- Bitter on the tongue as it goes down, and has a dominant coffee flavor. It's so much different from when I had it fresh. I remember tons of bourbon in the taste, and I'm honestly barely getting any. There is some vanilla in the aftertaste, but it's predominantly coffee and a bitter dark chocolate flavor throughout. Reminds me of KBS.
M- Could use a little more carbonation, but it's nice and thick.
O- More than I could say I'm disappointed, I'm just so surprised. This is the same exact beer I had fresh 2 years ago, and it's completely different. It's a little sweeter which I expected, but it has so much more coffee presence and so much less bourbon. It really reminds me of KBS, which is not a bad thing at all but the first time I had it it reminded me of Parabola. I'm putting this one down as a beer not worth aging. It's delicious in its own right still, but I enjoyed it so much more fresh. Still a solid barrel-aged offering from Dark Horse, and one of the better barrel-aged stouts floating around in my opinion. For those of you that are aging a few: drink them. 1,404 charactersAhappyhiker2, May 14, 2013

Aroma consists of light dry roasted malt notes with some black chocolate notes with medium bourbon notes with some vanilla undertones. Taste is also dominated by creamy black chocolate notes with some light dry roasted malt. Body is full with creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Not as complex as I was expecting but very well balance overall with chocolate and bourbon creating an efficient mix. 541 charactersPhyl21ca, May 06, 2013

A: Opaque dark, deep black with no light getting through this. 2 finger brown head which fades quickly into a thin collar and some wandering, appealing laces.
S: Smell is of dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla. Huge! A smooth smoky and nutty scent along with some dark fruits and a bit of alcohol follow.
T: Massive dark chocolate, sweet and roasted malts. Bourbon, vanilla very well blended to this malty profile. The upcoming booze brings dark fruits aroma. Finishes on nutty and resinous hops notes.
M: Full bodied, sweet, creamy, a bit chewy but not sticky. Not as warming as one could expect given the ABV. Easily drinkable. Just perfect!
O: A beautiful barrel aged stout. Smell and taste profiles are huge, massive. But this is so easy to drink, so good ! 808 charactersbeerpirates, May 05, 2013

A - pours a jet black, little bit of a mocha colored head that faded quickly
S - very smooth smell, well balanced mocha/coffee/hot boozy smell but the booze balances well
T - intial flavor is a smooth well made creamed coffee taste, I find too many BA Stouts have a more bitter burnt coffee taste, not this one, very smooth. The end note is a little hot, to be expected but again balanced well
M - great mouthfeel, nice and heavy
O - overall this is a really well made, well balanced smooth drinking BA RIS, I prefer this over a new KBS. If I have not said it enough, smooth and balanced!

Appearance: Black as Eddie Murphy with a small tan head that quickly recedes to the perimeter.
Smell: Oh yea! Barrel notes galore with vanilla, caramel, bourbon, dark fruit, dark chocolate, roasted malt sweetness. I'm even getting a bit of red wine character in there, nice.
Taste: Everything I like about normal Pt5, with barrel character to boot. I was almost afraid to drink this because I thought it would ruin the normal Pt5 for me. I don't even think I would say that this is better, it just adds another dimension with the barrel notes. I like both versions. What I like about this is that the bourbon character isn't overwhelming at all. Rather, it is evident but not overbearingly so and helps the other components to blend together with more unity.
Mouthfeel: This is a bit more viscous than the standard version of this brew. A little more stickiness is evident.
Overall: I love the non bb aged version of this so much, and this is a nice variation. Some of the malt sweetness I love in the fresh version of this beer is muted here, or it is perhaps this way because this is an '11 bottle. Either way, I like this, but until I try a fresh version of this, Fresh Pt5 wins out for me. 1,239 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Mar 13, 2013

A - black black black. Aggressive pour produces only a small amount of light brown head, which dissipates very quickly into some whisps on top. No lacing.
S - smells mainly of bourbon and oak, some chocolate, booze, vanilla.
T - big blast of smooth vanilla, bourbon, oak up front. Some chocolate notes on the edge, vanilla and hop bittering at the end. Leaves an after taste of vanilla and bourbon. A damn tasty barrel aged stout!
M - it's a bit thinner than I would like. Starts out a little high on the carb, but as it warms the carb settles down. Last third of the pour was very nice.
O - an absolutely fantastic beer. Maybe the best BA stout I've ever tried. If it were a little thicker, it would be perfect. A+, no question. 779 charactersBeerandboards, Mar 09, 2013

Nose is big on bourbon, charred oak, toasted nuts, vanilla combined with fruity dark chocolate, freshly brewed espresso, roasted malt, burnt sugar. Even straight out of the fridge, the aromas are huge. 
Taste started with a touch of bitter hops, burnt sugar, then lightly bitter dark roasted espresso and roasted malt, lightly smoky, before mellowing into sweeter dark chocolate and caramel. Bourbon flavors flourish on the finish, along with the dark chocolate. 
Full bodied, thick and creamy with some soft barely there carbonation. Very sticky on the lips so a bit of residual sugar. A very good imperial stout. 877 charactersnataku00, Mar 08, 2013

4.81/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Thanks to Jeff for cracking open one of the last of his stash. BBPt5 pours out even darker than the regular version (which was already darker than a black hole), although it doesn't seem to be quite as syrupy and thick, as this one actually creates some noise and light turbulence as it hits the glass. A dark-ish tan head slowly bubbles up into a thin foam and perches still on top of this black abyss of a beer.
Bringing this one to my nose and taking a big whiff reveals its huge bourbon barrel characteristics - there's no denying that this bad boy spent some considerable time encased in boozy wood. The bourbon in the aroma is very smooth, however, not harsh, pungent, or stinging like many of these BBA beers can tend to be. Other notable aromas include vanilla, light coconut, mild wood, roasted malts. There's also some sweet brown sugar and a huge, creamy coffee undertone that can be found on the back end. This is really a complex beer, just from the aroma alone. Sometimes BBA beers can kind of blend together and get repetitive, but this one smells wonderful and distinct.
BBPt5 slides across my palate as I take the first sip - it's super creamy and smooth, maybe even more so than the original (not surprisingly so). The first tastes to emerge are light syrup and sweet molasses. Before long, the bourbon inches its way into the flavor profile, but just like the aroma, it remains very smooth and easy to handle. Warming, but not "hot", and it's wonderful. Some heavy oak and vanilla tones charge in about halfway through.
As it warms up, I pick up more generous notes of dark, thick fudge and even some lightly sweet, dark fruits. Roasted coffee bounces in and out for pretty much the entire duration - a big component in the base beer that certainly isn't lost through the barrel. Overall, a seriously well developed and complex beer. Even in the finish, there are still a ton of things going on; mostly dark fudge, roasted coffee beans, sweet and warming bourbon, and heavy oak. The body stays creamy throughout - heavy and lightly chewy, low-medium carbonation - more carbonated than the base beer, which as surprising. 
Considering the high 14% ABV tag, this beer was insanely drinkable. I've never seen bourbon show up so heavily while remaining so smooth and tame at the same time. This is a barrel-aged beer done correctly - the flavors meld together extremely well. One of the best bourbon barrel beers I've had.
EDIT: 4/29/2013
After having this back-to-back(-to-back?) with KBS, Black Note, and BCBS, I think I can finally and honestly say that this is my favorite of the bunch. They are all extraordinary brews, but the thing that really sets BB Plead the Fifth apart is the incredible smoothness of the bourbon. Not ONCE, not even after warming up for nearly an hour, does the bourbon ever seem any bit stronger than "warm". So incredibly smooth and complex. Fantastic integration of the barrel flavors with the base beer as to not mask or hide any of the substantial flavors, either. Probably my favorite Bourbon Barrel beer. I love this stuff. 3,080 characterstectactoe, Mar 05, 2013

A: Dense black with chestnut edges. Tenacious ring of brown clings to the edge of the glass. Very syrupy.
S: Fudge, dark fruits, booze, sweet vanilla oakiness.The booze element is a little distracting, nonetheless this is delicious.
T: Big dark chocolately malt, tons of toasty nutty oak, drier than I expected from such a huge beer. Complex and delicious.
M: Lighter bodied than BCBS, a bit boozier, but highly drinkable for a beer of this girth. 464 charactersmattsander, Feb 25, 2013

This beer was black it had a brown head that was faded quickly but left a ring around the edge of the glass. The look of the beer is pretty typical for the style. The smell of the beer is surprising to me, I expected the barrel aging to stand out a lot more on this. There is some vanilla on the nose along with some other sweet aromas. The taste of the beer is also really subtle. I was surprised by this, Really thought you'd be able to get much more intense flavors of the barrel and the bourbon. It's a great tasting beer regardless. The mouthfeel is thick and gently carbonated, it's a very smooth beer. Overall it's much more balanced than I expected, it's a solid beer from start to finish. I would have enjoyed a little more bourbon on it though. It's good but I don't feel it's worth the 100% rating on here. 919 charactersKnapp85, Feb 19, 2013

Smell is quite bourbon forward. Lots of vanilla, burnt wood, tart dark fruit. Definitely some alcohol. Very very nice!!
Taste is lots of roast, char, chocolate, vanilla, some mild tart cherries. Tons of booze but not unwelcome. 
Body is viscous and rich, mouth is full with medium to mild carbonation. Finish is very long and wet.
Overall I was very impressed with this. I have had the base beer and enjoyed it but the barrel did an amazing job to this. Very smooth and rich barrel characters reminded me a lot of Parabola or Old Raspy XI. Possibly a bit better and more drinkable. 778 charactersazdback, Feb 16, 2013

2012 vintage 12oz bottle with silver wax poured into Kuhnhenn tulip
Pour: The pour on this was very thick and very dark black with not a hint of light coming through. There was a half finger of dark brown head that did not last. Lacing is spotty to non existent but the alcohol legs are all over the sides of the glass.
Smell: Chocolate fudge brownie or cake drizzled with bourbon! There is a touch of coffee, vanilla and a pleasant oak character. 
Taste: Huge rich chocolate up front with some roasted notes mixed in. There is the vanilla, coconut and definite oak. Some coffee, though mild comes through without creating much bitterness and considering the abv it is very well hidden. An absolutely phenomenally well balanced beer!
Mouthfeel: Oh so thick and creamy coating the palate very well creating a definite full beer. Carbonation seems just right here. 
Overall: Without Steimie's great generosity I would not have had the opportunity to try this sensational beer. I never would have thought I would say this but I have found a BA stout that gives my all time favorite BCBS a run for it's money! Like I said before this is just so well balanced it is an absolute enjoy to sip on. BCBS is an in your face bourbon bomb that I too enjoy but wow this is just a perfect balance with the bourbon complementing everything else. 1,406 characterssleuthdog, Feb 16, 2013

Aroma of chocolate, sweet molasses, dark fruits, roast, and something off that I am not a fan of (similar characteristics to Tres). Thick viscous mouthfeel with medium low carbonation. Heavy dark fruit up front followed by lots of dark bittersweet chocolate. Slight booze, but don't get much of the bourbon barrel in this. Was expecting a bit more vanilla oak, though my palate might be tainted from the Kuhnhenn BA 4D I had right before this. I tend to prefer non-fruity stouts, but this is generally well done. Relaxing sipper. I find it strange that the regular version was so full of roast and chocolate and this one went more fruity despite the barrel. Oh well, good beer just not as great as I had hoped. 801 charactersBMMillsy, Feb 12, 2013

A: Pours an opaque, nearly-jet black. Forms a thin brown head with low visible carbonation.
S: Oak, bourbon, chocolate, sweet vanilla and woody with tobacco, rum-soaked raisins and other such dark fruit. Very nice.
T: Follows the nose. Chocolate, coffee malts with big bourbon flavors over the oaky vanilla, rum raisins, roasty bittered malt. This is really tasty.
M: Thick, heavy body, creamy mouthfeel. Low carbonation, and the alcohol presence is fairly heavy as expected.
O: Wow. This one lived up to the hype, and perhaps surpassed it as far as I'm concerned. I'm very impressed. Highly recommended. 767 charactersmacrosmatic, Feb 11, 2013

With the huge amount of snowfall, a barrel aged imperial stout seemed like the way to go.
Appearance: As close to midnight black as possible. Pours a one finger dark brown head that quickly recedes into a light lacing.
Aroma: Really surprisingly good balance in the nose for 11%. Lots of chocolate fudge, dark fruit, vanilla and bourbon. The alcohol is there and isn't hidden at all, but it works really well. 
Taste: Big sweet chocolate fudge tones with really strong bourbon barrel tones. Big caramel, vanilla, oak and bourbon throughout. The barrel is very well integrated with the base. There is a touch of booziness but it works well with this kind of beer. I really like the dark fruit tones that incorporate even more sweetness into the beer. Really tasty.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied overall, but a little light for the style. Goes down very smooth.
Overall, a top tier barrel aged stout. It is a bit big and boozy at times, but I really like the big, sweet characteristics of this beer. The barrel is incredibly well integrated and really enhances the base beer. I remember not really loving this base beer, but the barrel makes this one of the best in this style. 1,311 charactersGosox8787, Feb 08, 2013

A - Pours a wonderful dark, rich brown with a very nice quarter inch dark chocolate head that fades to leave a thin blanket and a fluffier halo.
S - Woah. Alright, so yeah. The alcohol is super faint. Nice gentle bourbon (dont get me wrong, its there but not in a burning, boozy sense), rich, deep bakers chocolate. Some nice roasted malt notes, and almost like a cookie batter type aroma. That combination of malts, vanilla, chocolate lends a very cookie like aroma. Loving it.
T - Oh, hi there coffee. how are you today? Nice coffee notes along with some more bourbon. The alcohol continues to be light, with good chocolate notes, faint barrel notes as well. Nice vanilla too.
M - Chewy, lowly carbonated, with that 14% hidden nicely. Nice and creamy.
O - Overall, this was a very, very tasty bourbon barrel stout. Its hard to believe that regular Plead the 5th becomes this. Unreal. 1,066 charactersrudzud, Feb 08, 2013

A - this beer is oil slick black with a deep brown haze of a quarter inch head. The carbonation is scant and the lacing, minimal. 
S - the bourbon notes hit first and foremost; the are some chocolate cherry hints here as well; I'm getting some toffee and roasted chocolate too
T - wow...surprised with all the coffee flavor considering I missed those coffee notes on the nose; roasted chocolate malt; a bit o that bourbon and toasted oak; man, the coffee notes are heavy; a bit of toasted vanilla and toffee
M - again, I'm a bit shocked with something in this beer, the carbonation. Like, it's flat up front and fizzy on the way down...really hard to describe actually. It's creamy and full bodied for sure; nice swill overall; I had to edit this after realizing its 14%abv...it drinks like it is 7-8%...wow
O - so yeah, I'm surprised on a few elements of this beer. I really didn't think the coffee was going to shine through so much, but this beer is really coffee forward. I kind of wishes for more bourbon notes, but overall, this beer is well-balanced and smooth drinking. Nice! 1,211 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Feb 04, 2013

Pours pretty standard but solid for the style, slight bump for nice head given the ABV
Smell is very inviting, nice blend of chocolate, bourbon, oak, some coffee and dark fruit in there as well. 
Wow. I've had Pt5 many times and don't remember having anywhere near this reaction. Clearly a base beer that takes to a barrel very well. Nice warm milk chocolate, bourbon oak, toasted coconut, and some subtle smoke or charred oak. Incredibly balanced and nuanced. Not at all one dimensional. 
Almost no alcohol burn. Really nice chewy mouthfeel. Like drinking cold hot chocolate if that makes sense. 
One of the better beers I've ever had; really, really good stuff. Would love to snag several more bottles. And not that it matters, but stouts tend to be my 3rd or 4th favorite style, so I'm even more impressed. 913 charactersCruisaC, Jan 21, 2013

S-Very roasty malts with dark dark chocolate, coffee, and burnt aroma in the beginning. The alcohol and the bourbon cut through the initial aroma to finish off the smell.
T-The bourbon is in the beginning of this beer with the sweet caramel maltiness associated with it. The barley comes through afterward with the deep roast of coffee with very subtle chocolate flavors.
M-It has an average viscosity, which was a little unexpected for such a high alcohol beer. The alcohol is very sharp on the tongue and the carbonation is low.
O-Great beer, worth getting if you can buy it or trade something not too outstanding for it. I would put it on par with a lesser version of KBS. 766 charactersjvillefan, Jan 18, 2013

I had this on tap in a 11.5oz snifter at Kalamazoo Beer Exchange during a Dark Horse Tap Takeover.
A: Arrived to my table with a finger of head on it that was the color of foamy soil. The body of the beer was black like motor oil and I could see the carbonation in it. Light lacing as head went down.
S: I noticed the chocolate malt smell right off the bat mixed with the bourbon smell. It did have a boozy smell the emptier my glass got. A light dried fruit smell accompanied the smell of bourbon and chocolate malt.
T: Roasted malts with chocolate are very noticeable instantly. On the third sip the rest of the flavors began shining through and had hints of dried fruit and toffee. The bourbon flavor is very present throughout. The booze is pretty hidden but at times is present.
M: Thick and creamy. The carbonation was just right.
O: This is a great BA stout that improves greatly upon its base beer. While it is a great beer, it does not quite stack up against others in the upper echelon of BA stouts. Very solid but do not trade away the cellar for it. 1,117 charactersDavihaw, Jan 13, 2013

In a world of ever evolving and growing barrel-aged stouts, let's see how this one ranks.
A - Looks like a stout, pours pretty thick but couldn't get much of a head to develop or stay.
S - Definitely at correct serving temperature and this one doesn't open up much on the nose. Most great BA stouts I can smell once the cap is popped but when I jab my nose in the glass this beer still doesn't have a lot of aromatics. Hints of bourbon, alcohol and roasted malt...not much doing.
T - Thankfully this beer is much different than the aroma. A sweet bourbon flavor at the beginning then transitions to a velvet malted barley flavor with hints of deeply roasted coffee and a hint of toffee. Finishes off pretty boozy/hot but with hardly any age it is to be expected.
M - A little thin for my liking but it works with the low volumes of carbonation in the beer. It's a little astringent on the tongue and the booze tingle is definitely present in the aftertaste, which lasts forever. Definitely a sipper to the definition.
A very well made barrel-aged stout which I'm sure improves with a little age but I wouldn't sit on it for more than a year guessing by the thinner body. Easy to drink, great bourbon flavor and a nice stout overall. 1,272 charactersVaTechHopHead, Jan 09, 2013

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've been looking for this beer for the last couple years now and BA mia4ipa was kind enough to share one with me. Poured from a 12oz wax sealed bottle into mini pint glasses. Served at just below room temperature.
A - Pours out like thick, black motor oil with little to no head. Super-viscous. This has the classic look for a big, barrel aged imperial stout. Looking good... 
S - I was expecting a huge bourbon smell, but it's not over powering. Hints of bourbon, oak, dark chocolate and fudge.
T - Upon taking a sip, the initial notes are chocolate, toffee, and bourbon. There's just the right level of sweetness without being cloying, which is balanced by that nice bourbon barrel flavor, and a little bitterness at the end. This is one of the tastiest stouts I've ever had. It was surprisingly drinkable at 14% ABV too.
M - The mouthfeel was perfect for the style. It was slightly thick and chewy, but really enjoyable to sip on.
O - Probably one of my favorite barrel aged stouts. The bourbon wasn't as pronounced as it is in something like BCS, but this seemed much more balanced and enjoyable to drink. I wish I had more... 1,136 characterscnbrown313, Jan 04, 2013

4.12/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412 oz. bottle poured into a Kuhnhenn snifter. 2012 vintage.
Appearance - Very think inky black pour with a small mocha head. Nothing left after a while. Just a thin collar and three measly and miniscule islands of foam.
Smell - The barrel is very nice, but the aroma of the beer is intense. Bourbon, tons of oak, and a nice hint of vanilla from the barrel. Sweet malts, licorice. Coffee and dark chocolate are afterthoughts compared to the barrel, booze, and sugars.
Taste - The base beer shines through the barrel, but it adds a nice layer. Bourbon is immediately apparent. Deep dark chocolate flavors and a sweet fruit layer. Oak is really intense in the back. Lingering oaky finish is too strong and just pegs it back from perfect.
Mouthfeel - It's heavy, boozy, and overly oaked. Low carbonation. A monster of a beer.
Overall - While this beer is spectacular, the barrel hasn't improved it. Intense oak creates an unpleasant aftertaste. That being said, I had this on tap and it was incredible. Batch to batch may vary. I certainly won't mind exploring different vintages of this. 1,089 charactersAlieniloquium, Jan 02, 2013

S: plenty of chocolatey oat grains were noticeable upfront in the aroma with brown sugar molasses sweetness, subtle burnt sugar, good bourbon barrel booze present and a little coffee bean coming through as well.
T: molasses with brown sugar sweetness were more prominent on the palate alongside chocolate goodness, nice roastiness, coffee accents, a touch of vanilla, plenty of oat grains, well balanced booze and bourbon barrel notes that added plenty of character to the base beer.
M: the brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a roasty, boozy, chocolatey, sweet, rich and chewy finish.
O: definitely a must have, plus the bourbon barrel treatment really gave this beer great qualities all around; Delicious 901 charactersGobzilla, Jan 01, 2013

(A)- Pours pitch as black night and fairly thick. A surprising crown of brown froth formed. Even some lacing was left behind as it dissipated.
(S)- A lovely rich combo of a molasses / chocolate / roasted caramel / and bourbon barrel sexiness. A really harmonious aroma.
(T)- Same as the smell, only a distinct higher level of bitter roastedness coming through. Combined with the superb barrel characteristics, I have absolutely zero complaints.
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. As great as the sweet and rich barrel notes are in this, the underlying roasted qualities from the base beer still coming through is quite superb. Makes for a very dynamic tasting and feeling beer.
(O)- Overall, world class. I had a sample of this years ago at a beer fest and it has haunted me since. Now finally trying it in bottled form was really rewarding. Fantastic fresh, but for me, it just might benefit with a little more time on it. Looking forward to seeing if I am right. One of the best for the style hands down. 1,156 characterssweemzander, Dec 29, 2012
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52012 vintage. 12 oz silver waxed bottle into a brandy snifter. Can't thank Steimie enough, this was a huge want of mine!
A - Pours a thick black body with a finger of dark mocha head. After that fizzles away its quite difficult to recreate a head with a swirl. Just some splotchy lacing with some nice retention. Alcohol legs stain the sides of the glass.
S - Bourbon dipped fudge brownie is the description I would use here. Rich and gooey dark chocolate, dry cocoa powder, light espresso and coconut. Finishes with smooth oak and vanilla and warming alcohol which does comes off as a bit too distracting.
T - Starts with dark chocolate and light roasted malts. Then comes a huge wave of vanilla, oak, and butterscotch. Lighter notes of coffee beans, coconut, and dark fruits. The finish is fudge with a bit of leather. Rich and decadent, just fucking perfect!
M - Thick and coating, just a notch below syrupy. Carbonation is spot on.
O - Truly one of the best BA stouts out there. How anyone can trade this stuff after sampling it is beyond me. Compared to its major 12 oz competition, well I think I like BCBS a bit more since its a brash stout that is all about the bourbon. This beer is much more balanced with the bourbon complimenting the base beers notes. God dammit this is good stuff! 1,299 charactersdavey101, Dec 28, 2012

Beautiful pour that runs out of the bottle like black ketchup. Not much head. Smell is fruit and bourbon, a little bit of chocolate behind. But it's all more faded than I expected, doesn't assert itself with sweet bourbon.
Taste. Hmmmm...again, faded a bit. Except for a surprising hoppy bitterness. Is this an 11 that past it's prime? Or is it not all that? Again, not bad, but not all that.
Mouthfeel - because the bourbon isn't as pronounced as expected, zero burn. Great viscosity. Can't believe it's 14%. Consistency is probably all that keeps me from declaring this a par beer.
Overall, a very good beer, but as with the base BT5, I apparently like this less than the average bear. And in the pantheon of bourbon barrel stouts, stunningly, I would rate this as slightly below average. Worth drinking, and recommended, but I would not pay $7/bottle for it or trade for it at a high premium. 1,011 characterslurpy1, Dec 26, 2012

2011 vintage
A big thanks goes out to injuredreserve for sending this one over in a trade.
A: Pours black as night with less than a 1/2 finger sliver of dark mocha colored head, which quickly dissipates down to just a thin outer ring. Leaves a few patches of lacing. 
S: Initially I get tons of dark fruit notes accompanied by an equally large bourbon presence. Also get milk chocolate, roasted malt, cherries. Wonderful. 
T: Milk chocolate, bourbon, and roasted malt all explode onto the palate with the first sip. Its rather sweet, and noticeably bitter. Coffee, raw oak, bakers chocolate. Quite complex. Nice combination of sweetness and barrel notes, but I could do without the bitterness, which tends to be the flavor that lingers in the aftertaste at the finish of each sip. 
M/D: Very smooth, appropraite carbonation, maybe a touch thin for the style. ABV is exceptionally well masked though, and drinkability is insane. Really cant believe this is 14%. 
O: Overall, an excellent beer. Doesnt quite stack up with the best of the style, but certainly an enjoyable drink that I would drink again in a heartbeat. Highly recommend. 1,167 characterszac16125, Dec 25, 2012

A: Looks identical to the regular: pitch black body, thin brown head. Solid.
S: Wow. This is amazing. Huge bourbon, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and major coconut. Big, rich, and complex. BA RIS perfection.
T: Follows the nose initially, with enormous barrel presence providing generous bourbon, vanilla, and coconut. Roasty coffee and dark chocolate behind. The only downside is a significantly boozy finish. Wonderful.
M: Thick, creamy, and moderately carbonated. Terrific.
O: This was an absolute winner - a huge step up over the non-BA version, and a clear superior to the overly-syrupy (in comparison) BCBS. The coffee and bourbon worked beautifully together, and I'm simply enjoying the hell out of it. Thanks Ryan!

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52012 Vintage, big thanks to Cosmicevan for gifting this bottle to me at a tasting!
Pours a straight black with minimal head. The small head that does form is a perfect deep brown, really awesome appearance. Spots of lacing around the glass.
Smell is sweet chocolate! Like you're smelling melted chocolate, really enjoyable. Dark and milk chocolate with bourbon bringing it together perfectly. 
Taste is PHENOMENAL , all the characteristics to look for in a stout. Mainly taken over by sweet chocolate, slight roasted notes toward the tail end and the bourbon hitting the palate perfectly. The balance here is really remarkable, the way the traditional stout flavors tie together so well with the barrel aging. Can't say enough about how enjoyable this is. 
Mouthfeel is just what I look for in a stout. Just the right amount of viscosity and stickiness. coating the palate and so smooth for a barrel aged beer. I love barrel aged beers but I have never had one that is this easy and smooth to sip on. The fact that this beer is 14% abv is just unbelievable, not a trace of alcohol heat.
So I think I've found my benchmark for barrel aged stouts. Just can't find a flaw in this beer. Such a fantastic balance and everything else is just outstanding. Best stout by a mile and my second perfect 5. 1,299 charactersPete27lax, Dec 17, 2012

Thanks to cosmicevan for the bottle
This is an amazing looking beer.. Jet black with a dark, dark brown head.
It literally smells like a combo of milk and dark chocolate.. With a hint of a marshmellow-ly sweetness that is complimented with a subtle ethanol/bourbon combo.
This beer, tastes and feels like you are taking a bite out of a half melted bar of chocolate that has been infused with a little bourbon.. Perfectly balanced, perfectly carbonated.. Viscous and chewy.
And 14%? What a joke, easily the smoothest BA imperial stout I've ever had.
 I give this beer a perfect score.. And because of this beer.. I am revisiting my past reviews and downgrading any beer that I have previously given a 5, for no beer deserves a 5 in comparison to this beer.. Regardless of style.

Thanks, joshrosborne!
(Aged for 1 year)
Nearly black in color with a very small whisper of dark brown head that falls away quickly. Leaves the glass somewhat messy with irregular webs of sticky, small bubbles.
Pleasant, complete aroma of oak and bourbon, very mild chocolate, some roast. All the expected players are in the pool.
The flavor follows the aroma, with the bourbon and oak leading the way, along with roast, very mild chocolate, and dark black bread. Low bitterness, and the alcohol is exceptionally well hidden given the known heft.
Full in body with low carbonation. Oily, slick, and rich. Lingering chocolate finish. Incredible. 
Excellent, but I actually think the base beer is better--full disclosure, the base beer is one of my all-time favorites. 805 charactersehammond1, Dec 16, 2012

Apperance: poured thick black oil. head at first was about 2 inches sort of khaki brown, lots of big bubbles. fadded quickly into small head small bubbles, nice lacing.
Smell: big chocolate and vanilla up front with some of that bourbon oak. also got some coffee, tobacco, and leather at the end.
Taste: bourbon and oak up front, followed by the chocolate and coffee in the finish.
Mouthfeel: thick and creamy, just the way I like my big stouts. coats your mouth. abv is there but pretty well hidden.
Overall: I honestly think I like this better then kbs/bcbs. reason is because the bourbon is not overpowering and blends with the base beer very well. 739 charactersfounder26, Dec 09, 2012

a - pours black and clearly has a high viscosity to it. a thin cap of dark brown head creeps up slowly, then settles back to a thin film. leaves some nice long legs of lacing in the glass. 
s - bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, raisin, faint char. an absolutely divine nose on this one.
t - all of the nose, really. starts off roasty and chocolatey, then the vanilla and barrel aged goodness comes out. has some faint dark fruity notes in there and a pleasantly smooth bourbon finish. very well put together.
m - full bodied, medium carbonation, finer co2 profile. has some alcohol heat still but very smooth.
o - honestly i'm pretty impressed by this one. i haven't had many bourbon barrel beers, but this definitely gives kbs and bcbs a run for their money. reputation is well deserved here and this is certainly worth seeking out if you're into big stouts. 952 charactersdivineaudio, Nov 29, 2012

Pours a midnight black color with barely any head. Wisps of retention slink across the top, with a few spots of lacing on the glass. 
A rich mix of vanilla and chocolate soaked in bourbon in the nose. A bit sweet with roasted dark malts and some softer tones of dark fruits. Softly charred oak, booze and really faint smoke. 
Boozy vanilla bean up front with plenty of syrupy bourbon and softly charred oak. Dark chocolate, nuttiness and layers of roasted dark malts. Syrupy with a prolonging boozy warmth, followed by a light undertone of leather and very subtle smoke. Finishes sweet and boozy with vanilla. 
Fuller medium body, milder carbonation, sticky and creamy on the tongue. I've had this one tap before and it was one of my favorite BA stouts ever, although the bottle doesn't quite recapture that moment for me. Definitely still a top notch offering, but the appearance and feel were slightly lacking. 971 charactersxnicknj, Oct 14, 2012

2011 Vintage
Thanks to Lurchingbeast for this long time want. 
Appearance: Plead the Fifth pours midnight black, with only the faintest hint of deep red visible along the edge of the glass. A rough pour yields a good sized mocha coloured head that lasts pretty well for a 14% barrel aged beer and leaves some good looking lacing as it recedes. A light swirl coats the glass in incredibly heavy, yellow tinted alcohol legs. 
Smell: As expected, quality bourbon dominates the initial nose, with the base imperial stout notes becoming apparent as the beer warms. Warming also yields some nose tingling alcohol, but it stops just short of becoming bothersome. 
Notes include: Bourbon, vanilla, toffee, sweet caramel, butterscotch, spicy oak, dark chocolate, cocoa, raisins, molasses and a little roasted malt. 
Taste: Unexpectedly, the flavour is actually a little boozier than the nose, though still stops short of being unpleasant. Notes include: Caramelized brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, butterscotch, dark fruit, molasses, cocoa, a touch of coffee and a surprising amount of roasted malt. The finish is moderately bitter and lightly astringent. 
Mouthfeel: Just shy of a full body, with a medium level of smooth carbonation. The finish is moderately bitter and surprisingly dry. 
Overall: Plead the Fifth is certainly a delicious barrel aged imperial stout, but I don't think it quite lives up to the hype and I would choose KBS or Parabola above it. That said, I would still love to have this again and would be very interested to see how it is after another year or two in the bottle. 1,669 charactersThehuntmaster, Oct 04, 2012

3/4" head slowly rises from the thick black oil looking brew. Head is made of dense soapy bubbles.
Strong vanilla/bourbon scent, smells great, a bit on the strong side, but still great! Oakey, woody and dense 90% dark chocolate. 
Chalky, milky, dark and robust. Tons of well hidden heat. Bourbon flavor is fantastic! Lots of vanilla flavors Light carbonation, no bitterness, and fantastic after tastes. 
If you follow my reviews, you'll see I rarely "throw around" "5s"... This brew is Fantastic and is a total ass kicker @ 14%, wow. Great depth and character in this fine, fine brew.. Highly recommended and should be considered a MUST try. Thank you for sharing abanton!!! 711 characterschugalug06, Sep 28, 2012

Score: 98
2012 vintage bottle served in a snifter glass and enjoyed on 03/13/12. A big thank you to Nick for sharing this bottle with me; I had been wanting to try it forever.
Appearance: Pours a jet black color with a super thin, creamy layer of mocha head that settles to a pencil thin ring around the glass. Good lacing too. 4.5/5
Smell: Lots of vanilla and raisin. Smooth bourbon, vanilla cupcakes, molasses, rich chocolate, fudge, tobacco and a hint of cherry. 4.5/5
Taste: Luscious dark chocolate and a little caramel flavor. Incredibly creamy and absolutely no alcohol presence whatsoever. Mellow vanilla too. Fig and prunes. As it layers and warms, molasses and a little bit of toffee and smooth bourbon-without-the-boozy-bite flavor comes out. Fudge, milk chocolate and melted dark chocolate on the midpalate. Super chocolatey backbone here. Finish is cocoa and dark chocolate with a hint of bourbon flavor. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied, minimal carbonation. Incredibly creamy mouthfeel. Slightly sweet finish. 5/5
Overall: This is one of the best barrel-aged stouts out there; it is every bit as good as the FiftyFifty Eclipse White Wax (Elijah Craig 18-aged version). The taste is absolutely incredible. I wish I had a bottle of my own! Thanks again for sharing this one with me Nick!
Recommendation: Go get yourself a bottle of this magnificent elixir. Even casual beer drinkers should be able to revel in its chocolatey glory.
Pairings: French vanilla ice cream.
Cost: $8 for a 12 oz bottle. 1,624 charactersjegross2, Sep 15, 2012

Appearance. Poursalmost thick and black with almost no head, just a fine skim of dark brown bubbles on the surface.
Smell. Bourbon for sure, not very boozy though. Wood and Vanilla are there too, some roasty dark malts and a little caramel and coffee. 
Taste. Bourbon, sweet vanilla, sweet caramel and coffee, some booze and a little burnt sugar (more burnt than caramel, anyways), just a little dark roasted malts. 
Mouthfeel. Full body, low carbonation. A little warm. 
Overall. A nice bba stout, no question. Seemed a little boozy and could probably use another year or two, but really not that bad for a 14% beer. Would love to try it again nicely aged. 714 charactersRutager, Sep 11, 2012

A: Pours completely opaque black, even on the pour with a finger of dense brown head. Retention is very good.
S: Molasses are most prevalent, but dark chocolate is close behind with light toffee in the background. Oak and bourbon are also there, but even further back.
T: Dark chocolate is now upfront with molasses and caramel close behind. I also get very well integrated bourbon way in the background. The flavors of this beer mix incredibly well. A bit too boozy, but not over the top and expected for the ABV.
M: The best part of this beer - extremely thick and creamy.
O: The integration of the flavors in this beer are phenomenal. The mouthfeel is also nearly perfect. I could use a bit more complexity and a bit more roast, but this beer is very, very good. 804 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Sep 10, 2012

A: Pours a dark, oily black -- the color of motor oil that has been used several thousand miles past spec. A pinky finger of dark mocha head caps the beer; retention is short. 
S: Vanilla, caramel / burnt sugar, fudge, bourbon, oak, molasses. The net effect here is reminiscent of early, keg-only Parabola. I shed a tear for the hoppy abomination the bottle form has become, and give praise that Dark Horse seems to have stumbled onto Firestone-Walker's formula. 
T: As in the nose, the flavor captures a delicious blend of fudgy vanilla. Bourbon is somehow less prominent than the vanilla bean character, though it is by no means hidden. A touch of roast evokes earthy coffee, but this is a minor element; the beer clearly prefers the chocolate-dessert approach, and I'm not one to complain about that. 
M: Chewy and oily, but not lingering or difficult to remove from the palate. In fact, it finishes relatively cleanly for something this big. And it hides the ABV quite well. I'm sure this is beyond 14% (isn't that what the base beer has?). My only complaint is that as it warms, it has a distinct solventy aftertaste, which in several bottles became unbearable at the proper serving temp. 
O: I had this a few times out of the bottle and detected noticeable variation. Two bottles were outstanding; very fudgy and rich, with great bourbon integration. Others were a little cardboardy and solventy. I'm tweaking my score so that the overall grade is a rough average of the bottles I've had. 
Incidentally, I compared this to early batches of Parabola, but it also reminds me of a chewier Silva Stout. Overall, this is a fantastic beer and needs more love. 1,736 charactersArbitrator, Sep 07, 2012

A-Black as night with a skimming of dark tan head which leaves some lacing as you drink. 
S-Dominant aromas of bourbon, earthy oak, and heavily toasted malt. Also plenty of whiffs remniscent of sweet aromas vanilla and burnt sugar. The aromas really come out nicely as the beer warms.
T-Similar to the aroma but more layers and really nice complexity. Bourbon upfront, the oak and earthy aromas are quite present and really pleasing. I don't think I've noticed this quality as strong in any other BB RIS. Plenty of sweet, dark malt. Hints of bitterness but really mild for some of the chocolate and coffee like tastes detected. The sweet tastes of burnt sugar and vanilla really balance out the heavy characteristics. 
M-The mouthfeel is wonderful. My biggest complaint of most BB RIS is the syrupy, cloying and or alcoholic burn qualities. This one has none of the above and at a reported ABV of 14% it is absolutely world class. I've had 5%+ beers have more alcoholic sting than this baby. Body is heavy yet clean and almost crisp, a bitterness that is there but not at all lingering, this baby is smooth.
O-I was hesitant to get this on a hot day but had not had the pleasure before so had to brave the heat to try this, very glad that I did. This is a winner, now I have another beer that I have to add to the hit list to try to get every year. 1,392 charactersdeebo, Sep 05, 2012

Appearance: Color is an oily pitch black with a moderate amount of bubbles. About one finger of deep tan head which fades into a thin patchy layer. Leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass. 
Smell: Smells very big, rich, and fairly sweet. Nice scent of bourbon with good hints of vanilla, wood, and oak chips. Big dark malts with big hints of chocolate, coffee, molasses, maple syrup, burnt caramel, toffee, and dark bread. A little bit of smokey roast. A scent of alcohol is present but it blends in well with the dark sweetness. The vanilla and chocolate really stands out. Very rich and good aroma. 
Taste: As good as the aroma leads, Big taste of bourbon upfront with some good notes of vanilla, oak, and wood cask. Rich and sweet dark roasted malts with big notes of dark chocolate, bitter coffee, maple syrup, molasses, burnt toast, caramel, toffee, butterscotch, and a little bit of smoke. Some alcohol heat is tasted but not as overwhelming as one might expect. Good balance of sweetness from the vanilla and chocolate, with the bitter roast. Really great taste here. 
Mouthfeel: A rich and heavy body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Creamy and fairly syrupy and creamy. Sweet but far from cloying. Smoother than expected at 14%. 
Overall: A really great Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. Big, rich, and dark while keeping the sweetness and booze taste under control. 1,501 charactersMattyG85, Sep 04, 2012

Appearance: Looks like thick motor oil with a nice mocha rim to it. A ring is left along the top of the glass. 
Smell: Bourbon dominates the nose. Alcohol, oak, and a dark roasty aroma are the most prominent aromas beyond the initial bourbon.
Taste: Smooth bourbon is the first thing to touch my palate and has a huge flavor. Some roasted malt, sweet chocolate, and oak give it the complexity it needs. Booze warmth as it finishes. 
Mouthfeel: Heavy mouthfeel, creamy, and boozy. 
Overall: Very much different from the base beer, as the bourbon is strong. I honestly think I prefer the base in this case, but that is not to say that they took anything away from it with the BB version. 778 charactersmfavoino, Aug 25, 2012

Pours a jet black color with a dense dark tan foam that stood just under a couple fingers tall before collapsing down thin. The foam is mostly retained atop the beer though a small section has erased completely. Complex aroma includes molasses and toffee along with a prominent bourbon barrel component that takes shape as maple, vanilla, and a bit of charred oak. As the beer continues to warm, I'm picking up a candied fruit note reminiscent of chocolate covered blueberries. Diving into the first sip, it's the molasses and char/smokiness that stand out to me first. Dark, bitter chocolate comes up next and there's a bit of raisin on the back end. Lots of bitterness here to make sure this keeps the massive malt bill in check and this lingers on a bit in the finish. Hefty on the palette while carbonation is taking a back seat. 
This is a malt heavy, complex beast of a beer and the bourbon barrel components blend right in. I'll be savoring this slowly over the rest of the evening. Thanks again, Al! 1,134 charactersBrewerB, Aug 23, 2012

S: Really smooth and sweet bourbon up front. Chocolate, roasted malts and oak. Dark chocolate and raisins on the finish.
T: Bourbon up front like the nose, but again, it's very smooth and sweet. Just a touch of heat comes from it. Sweet caramel and oak barrel. Coffee like dark chocolate with a little bitterness to it. The finish is toffee and raisin.
M: Thick and heavy bodied. Creamy mouthfeel with a medium to low carbonation level. 
O: The barrel aging really took this beer to another level with out sacrificing the complexities of the base beer. I'm glad it still retained the body that regular Plead the 5th carries. A must try. 887 charactersTreebs, Aug 21, 2012

2011 vintage, poured into a 25 cl tasting tulip. 
A: Pour is thick and black, with a dark brown caramel head. Slight redness on the pour and legs, but very hard to detect. A textbook imperial stout look-wise.
S: Bourbon notes, alcohol warming your nostrils, big bourbon hit and pleasant dark chocolate.
T: Dark chocolate bitterness is the first thing that touches the palate, which is then swept away by candy sugar and bourbon sweetness. I could spend ages trying to describe the tastes that pop up in this brew. It's a taste explosion that lingers far into the aftertaste. The after-sip aroma on the tongue is pleasantly bitter, as if to fool you the sweet, woody bourbon was never there.
M: Soft carbonation through a thick oily mass makes this slide down deceptively easy. Velvety smooth and just as sexy.
O: I cannot sing the praises of this beer enough. Though it would have probably scored higher if it had a slight touch of extra bitterness from the dark roasted malts, I find it very hard to fault this. If you can somehow get this, you definitely should. I'll be after you if you don't. 1,185 charactersDennoman, Aug 02, 2012

A: Pours black with a very thin dark chocolate head that quickly dispersed into a faint collar leaving wisps of lace. 
S: Huge notes of sweet bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel and dark chocolate. I’m getting almost none of the roast and anise that I pick up in the regular version. 
T: A huge improvement on the original. Rich and decadent flavors of buttery oak, chocolate fudge, sweet and sticky bourbon, raisins, caramel, and vanilla. The bourbon and oak and integrated very well and have seemed to smooth over all the rough edges of the original. I’m getting some peat in the original that isn’t found in the barrel version. Very smooth and rich. 
M: Low but creamy carbonation, slight alcohol warmth, rich and smooth mouthfeel with a full body. 
O: Side by side these two beers are like night and day. While the original is good, the flavor profile on the barrel aged one makes it taste like it doesn’t even have the same base beer. Well worth finding a bottle or two. Thanks again, HosP, for sending me a couple. 1,133 charactersscottfrie, Jul 18, 2012

Pours a pitch black ink. A dense, boozy finger of dark brown head swells up only to recede back to a neat collar. Sexy ass legs. Slow, fine beading hovers just below the cap. Beautiful.
Rich dark chocolate, molasses, big bourbon, various cocoa, more big spicy bourbon, think BCBS. I could sit and snort at this all day.
Hot damn. Thick wood (hehe) notes, vanilla, bourbon, breakfast syrup, boozy finish. I feel like the vanilla might really pop with some age. Unfortunately, this is my one and only bottle but I'm very grateful to have had the chance to try it!
Just another example of why the midwest conquers every other corner of the world when it comes to imperial stouts. 756 charactersyamar68, Jul 12, 2012
4.19/5  rDev -6.5%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Deep black with almost nothing as a head, kind dark cherry cola looking wisp to it. Aroma, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, all almost equally present, not domineering, nice.
Taste, wow, really smooth, more of the same elements from the nose keep their equitable place on the palate. Overall sweetness is up there, but never diabetes inducing stuff, really, this is a well balanced flavor profile for a huge beer, that doesn't knock you over the head with the alcohol. 
This is one of those special beers. Plead the 5th is an already great base beer. Sometimes (Rasputin) you can throw a great base beer into a bourbon barrel, and it becomes less great. Not the case here. It isn't a pretty beer, and the first look and smell won't tip you off to how good this is, but drink it, you'll like it.
Thanks to largadeer for breaking this, and many other gems out at the Solar Eclipse party. 884 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jul 09, 2012

Looks like an imperial stout, leaving good lace. Nice aroma of bourbon-coated roasty malts. Dark, almost burnt. Slight oxidization too.
Roasty up front, though the bourbon takes over quickly and overwhelms the other flavors. The barrel aging is a kinda out of control here; the barrel character shouldn't be this prominent.
Huge body is this brew's savior. Bourbon be damned: the viscous mouthfeel is right where it needs to be.
I prefer the base beer -- especially with age -- but this isn't bad. I hear last year's batch was much better (makes sense; the beer I'm drinking isn't anywhere near deserving of a 4.48 average). Hope I can try a 2010 bottle someday. 697 charactersbrystmar, Jun 30, 2012

A: Pours a deep black with a very small tan head that reduces quickly leaving a very thin ring on top. Minimal lacing forms and dissolves quickly. 
S: Lots of bourbon and roasted malt up front, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and a little bit of dark fruit. As it warms the wood comes forward a bit as well. There is a little bit of alcohol, just to let you know its there. 
T: Fantastic flavor profile. A great blend of bourbon flavors, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, mixed with a little bit of chocolate and light roasted malt. The bourbon really shines nicely in this beer, not too in your face. Faint dark fruit flavors add a bit of sweetness. 
M: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly dry, but sweet finish. No sign of the alcohol in the taste. 
O: Really great beer. The flavors blend nicely with the level of bourbon presence being spot on. I can see why it is so sought after. 972 charactersmdaschaf, Jun 27, 2012

2011 vintage.
pours the customary used motor oil black; a fairly aggressive pour yields an expected short lived mocha / almost cinnamon tone head.
assertive nose offers a wallop of bourbon right out of the gate, which is followed by chocolate and roasted malt characters; secondary notes of vanilla, molasses, and a subtle dark fruit-like presence. 
flavor follows the nose pretty closely. make no mistake, this one is a bourbon bomb (which i live for), but the bourbon doesn't overwhelm the other elements. the chocolate, roastiness, vanilla et al pull through in fine form. delicious. full bodied mouthfeel, velvety more than chewy if that makes sense. some heat but not what you'd expect from a 14% monster.
overall, a stellar imperial stout. almost unfair to lump some of these barrel-aged beers in with the general population, but this one stands out even among other barrel aged brews. if you're fortunate enough to come across it, don't hesitate.

Pours black as night with absolutely no head. I never knock a stout for no head. The head on a stout just doesn't do it for me anyway. I still love the thickness of this beer to give the appearance a 4.5
Strong Bourbon smell in the aroma of this beer. Little bit of chocolate aroma, but mostly bourbon.
Taste is a huge rival of KBS and all the top stouts. I actually think this tops KBS for me. It drinks a bit smoother and is actually higher in ABV. Quite a bit of bitterness here as well as alcohol burn, but still goes down smooth.
Mouthfeel is medium to low carbonation, but a little higher bitterness than most of these BBA stouts.
Overall, this is a great stout that I enjoy just as much if not more than KBS. I would say if you like BBA stouts you have got to try and get this. It's a wonderful beer in this genre! 997 charactersMichPaul, Jun 22, 2012

A - Thick black with no head, alcohol lacing, dark brown edges.
S - Cherry, molasses, sweet, alcohol, cocoa, vanilla tinted bourbon.
T - Bourbon!!!! Chocolate, molasses, cherry, alcohol. So much bourbon, the barrel dominates the flavor. Oak, vanilla extract, light char.
M - Medium body, zero carbonation.
O - Fantastic! A perfect display of bourbon barrel flavors layered onto an excellent stout base. Thought this beer had more bourbon notes than KBS, which I didn't realize was possible. 558 charactersgreenmonstah, Jun 18, 2012

This guy eluded me for a while, but I finally caught it at Hawthorne's. Served in a Chimay chalice, I can't imagine a better looking beer: thick, dark black like motor oil, capped with a creamy dark chocolate head that quickly sank to a ringlet of bubbles. Maybe a little more retention would've been nice, but I didn't expect much from such a high octane beer. Aroma of dark malts, moderately roasty, dark chocolate, heavy bourbon. Dark sweet malts in the taste, chocolate chips, toasted marshmallow, heavy yet smooth bourbon with notes of vanilla and oak. Full body, creamy and delicious, a great sipper. Not quite as smooth as a nicely aged BCBS, but a great brew nonetheless. 725 charactersRifugium, Jun 10, 2012

Thanks brother! Served from bottle into a Ommegang Three Philosophers chalice. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised roasted malt, sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, wood, sweet alcohol, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark fruit, raisin, vanilla, wood, and sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. The aroma on this one was really quite nice and very complex. All of the right components for the style were present in this one. The barrel really did a nice number on this brew as the regular version was quite good, but this turned that up to 11. The flavor was very well balanced and inviting making it quite easy to drink despite the high ABV. This could definitely get you in A LOT of trouble if not careful. An absolute must try if you are a fan of beer. Really glad I finally got the chance to try this one myself! Thanks again Rillo! 1,181 charactersthagr81us, Jun 09, 2012

Look: Pours a midnight black with a tiny head and no real retention and leaves a slight coating on the glass
Smell: The barrel character on this one is extremely present. Lots of bourbon and oak upfront with some nice chocolate notes picking up the backend
Taste: For me this is where the beer goes wrong. The bourbon and alcohol and upfront and very overpowering and off putting. Disguised behind the Alcohol are some chocolate and oak and not much else. 
Mouthfeel: The body is slightly thin for the style and not much carbonation and quite a bit of alcohol burn. 
Overall: If you like stouts that taste like cheap bourbon this one is for you. There is no balance whatsoever in this beer and I don't feel like it even holds a candle to some of the high alcohol big stouts 789 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jun 05, 2012

2011 vintage. 3-4 oz. poured into a CBS snifter on May 18th, 2012.
A - Looks almost identical to the regular Pt5, though maybe a tad thinner with a little less residual film across the sides of the glass. 
S - Great Heaven Hill barrel notes. Charred oak. Vanilla beans throughout. Balanced bourbon. Milk chocolate. Roasted malts. Roasted peanuts and almonds. It leads you on but doesn't press too much, if that makes sense.
T - Is this my stairway to heaven? Awesome vanilla, more milk chocolate bar, additional deeper cocoa, almonds, and rich espresso beans. I find it pretty cool that the barrel elements are so pronounced yet don't overtake the great dark chocolate bitterness I love in the regular version. Really nice oak/wood flavoring, with subtle tannins before and after the finish. 
M - Moderate body, appropriate carbonation, and a fair amount of finishing dryness. 
D - Infinitely drinkable for the ABV, as much so as KBS. Absolutely one of best barrel-aged stouts I've had, and more importantly one of the best barrel implementations I've had regardless of style.
Edit - Split a 2012 vintage on 1/20/2013, thanks Dan. Though the ABV seems to have dropped roughly 3%, this is still rocking. I'm not sure 2012 is quite as mammoth as 2011 was, but it's close enough to give DH the nod for consistency.
Edit #2 - directly compared another 2012 vintage to regular 2012 Bourbon County. I must say, it didn't hold up well at all. Docking a number of points, as much as it pains me to do. 1,690 charactersAuracom, May 31, 2012

This beer pours a full bodied, black chocolate black with no head but a dark khaki lacing around the rim. The nose is very rich and roasty. T has some fudge brownie to it, LOADS of chocolate. That said, there isn't much bourbon at all. The flavors are really smooth and chocolaty. Again, loads of chocolate fudge and brownie. There is barely any bourbon at all and moderate roast. Great flavor on the chocolate standpoint, but disappointing in terms of barrel aged imperial stouts. This is the most palatable chocolate I've ever experienced in a beer. It is pretty light in body, compared to others of the style. I would describe it as a light medium. It does however increase drinkability. Overall this is a very nice beer, but doesn't show the bourbon you would expect. If I had to guess, I would say that this is oak aged or just aged regular Plead the 5th. All of that said, this beer was delicious. 997 charactersaasher, May 29, 2012

Pours black as black, not much head. A few bubbles chunking on-top.
Bright bourbon nose with bar chocolate, heavy roast, rocket fuel, espresso, Nutella, marzipan, and malt bitterness. Smells phenomenal.
Sweet bourbon upfront with gooey choco-fudge brownie, walnut, hazelnut creme, milk caramel, Mexican coffee, and hefty booze strength. Charred malts with extreme roast. Black and sweet with lovely breath of whiskey. Some of the best bourbon barrel qualities in a stout I have ever had.
Big-bodied and lightly-carbonated to style. Hot, even with a year down, but it's at a goddamn 14%. Still a great feel for the strength. 718 charactersthecheapies, May 21, 2012

Consumed as part of a Friday night lineup that included the '10, '11, & '12 vintages. One of my favorite regularly available stouts, so I've been looking forward to this vertical. 12 oz. wax-capped bottle. 
Pour is black & close to flat, but it makes up for it in the smell. Lush bourbon loveliness pours out after the wax is busted, but fades quickly. By the time it warms there's nothing but a hint of malt & figment of bourbon left. Huh. 
Bourbon Barrel Plead the Fifth is a shot of Maker's Mark to the gut; I wouldn't be surprised if this was 25% bourbon. Bourbon suffuses the base beer & overwhelms it with goodness (except I love the base beer). Roast manages to thrash its way out of the bourbon, & it retreats as it warms. Chocolate emerges rapidly; rich. Gorgeous. Deep wood that really adds some depth. Wasn't really digging this initially, but after some time, it grew on my rapidly. Up, up, & away. Heavy. Luscious. 
Wow. This one didn't impress me out of the gate, but as it warmed - really warmed, after about 25-30 minutes - it became amazing. This is an excellent beer that really complements the excellent base beer. Worthy. Glad I have one more. 1,247 charactersmaximum12, May 19, 2012

T: Like drinking a flourless chocolate cake. Rich and decadent, chocolate dancing with some fruity and herbal accents, slightly sweet but not overly. Strong alcohol bite on the finish.
M: Strikes an perfect balance. It's full and rich; but it's not sticky or cloying. Not much of any carbonation, but at this ABV, what can you expect; it doesn't detract at all in my opinion.

A- Pitch black, with a reddish mocha colored head. Some light lacing and a ring of foam retains around the glass.
S- Smells kinda rummy, with hints of roast malt and chocolate. Some excellent light peat and barrel character is also present. There is definitely still some heat and astringency.
T-Oh so smooth at first, then the flavors start to come out. Rich chocolate and bourbon flavors hit the tongue, dark roasted malt and even a hint of smokiness are present. More sweet oaky bourbon flavor, touches of vanilla and caramel.
M- While it is easy to drink for the %, the beer is lacking body. The carbonation is a little too light, and it's just a touch watery. While it does have a nice creamy feel on the tongue, this is the weakest trait.
O- Overall, I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. The base beer is a little thin, but the barrel aging has quite a nice touch. Could use a little time, but the flavors are still excellent.

Big thanks to Masterski for this one. 
Poured from a 12oz bottle.
Appearance: 1.5 fingers of dark brown foam with a dense brown body. After every sip, a trace of lacing is on the side of the glass.
Smell: Bourbon soaked chocolate, oatmeal-raisin cookies and coffee beans. Very powerful.
Taste: Dates, a bit of black licorice, and nuts mixed with grinded coffee. Bourbon mixes with roastedness but is rather tame.
Mouthfeel: Thick yet smooth with a slick feel and a bit of carbonation (not much). A bit thin in the finish but otherwise great.

Aroma has big oaky bourbon notes with a soft, silky chocolate note. 
The taste is far more complex: chocolate, vanilla soaked oak, rich roasted coffee, with bourbon notes mixing and adding to the complexity, not overpowering things. Awesome.
Nice full bodied, creamy, chewy feel. Can't really complain. 
Can't taste the alcohol, super drinkable. Lives up to the hype IMO. 465 charactersEgadBananas, Apr 22, 2012

A- pours a thin dark mocha head that recedes fairly quickly into a collar around the glass. 
Aroma is of sweet, faint booziness.
Roastiness blends well with the -bal qualities. As alcoholic as this seems I would not guess it at 14%abv
Medium to medium-thick mouthfeel. Low but fitting carbonation.
Reminded me a lot of BCBS and while this was a very good example of melding an imperial stout with bourbon barrel aging I'd have to give my preference to BCBS. That said, this is definitely worth seeking out if you are a fan of the style. 600 charactersDuff27, Apr 22, 2012

Similar flavors. Chocolate some sweeter roasted malts and just a hint of bourbon along with oak and some vanilla. Bourbon is very well integrated. It's there for the warming effect, but not overpowering.
Nice and sludgy, but not cloying. Lower carbonation.
Outstanding bourbon barrel stout. Bourbon is well integrated and not overpowering. The bitter malts I usually like in beers of this style aren't as present, but even though the flavor profile is on the sweeter side, it's not cloying or overly sweet.

I feel lucky to have come across this!!!
It's black as night with a thin cocoa brown head. 
Smells like a huge RIS with a nice bourbon scent. It's actually pretty strong- more comes out as it warms. You can smell that it has the potential to be HOT. 
Pure bliss!! Great bourbon flavor hits you right away. Really outstanding compared to Plead the 5th. Really oaky, roasted malt, fairly hot-as expected for a 14% beer. There is a good amount of coffee on the finish as well. 
Mouthfeel is dry, slick, with low carbonation.

T: Bourbon, dark chocolate, dark fruits, roasted malts, the bourbon is definitely present, but by no means overwhelming. This is up there with some of the best BB Imperial Stouts, I would not use the word 'boozy' with this, the alcohol is balanced very nicely 
M: Smooth and velvety, good carbonation, medium-full bodied, warming, pleasant aftertaste of dark fruits and light bourbon
O: Very tasty, very drinkable, this is a very good RIS, I wish I had more 745 charactersderkfromwi, Apr 11, 2012

2011 vintage.
Pours an opaque black with a khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, cocoa, cinnamon, wood, and bourbon. Taste is pretty much the same with an alcohol kick in the throat with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but it’s a bit hot in my opinion. 515 charactersUCLABrewN84, Apr 11, 2012

 12oz bottle poured into a Lost Abbey tulip 2011 vintage
A-- Poured black, settled black. Just hints of ruby in the pour and at the top of the beer. At best a dark reddish brown film. Good collar though. Very little if any head. A few carbonation bubbles but not a lot to this. A dark oily residue left with this and just a bit of spotty lacing. No ABV legs for this ABV of a beer. 
S-- Wow, big aggressive nose. Big, dark chocolate. Not powder but chocolate. Roasted fig or date, roasted prune, almond or walnut (the wood from the barrel) smell underneath the fruit and chocolate. Rich and thick nose full of bourbon and barrel. Heck yeah. 
T-- Thick liquid chocolate, followed by prune, walnut, carmel, and some small amounts of roasted almond. Bourbon is really present in this. Just a thick and rich taste. Flipping scary beer.
M-- Heavy feel but lighter in the mouth than one would suspect. Carbonation?? Try again on that. Little to no carbonation. Silky smooth feel though. Alcohol is very obvious on this going down. Very oily, rich feel in the mouth. Dark, bitter chocolate is also made known in the mouth. Literally gets richer and gets more depth as work through this. Bourbon that hides as a port. Long lasting flavor that kicks ass. Wicked stuff. 
O-- Slow sipper is a good starting point. Big, bold balsy beer. Not for the faint one bit. Beats the heck out of most BA RIS. Worth finding. Worth savoring 1,492 charactersmulder1010, Apr 06, 2012

4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 412 oz. bottle courtesy of a recent trade - thanks! Poured in to a tulip.
Appearance: Pours an onyx, deep and pool like, viscous but at the same time oily and slick looking. A moderately vigorous pour yields a surprising amount of head for a barrel aged, 14.0% abv brew - about three quarters of a finger of foamy espresso with surprising retention sits atop the body, about as thick as the inky sludge it's sitting on top of. It ultimately fades in to a similarly thick, foamy ring and a few sparse wisps of surface bubbles, with the persistence of the former being somewhat of a mystery, as even direct exposure to light reveals no internal carbonation. Half a point off for the inability of this one to hold any modicum of lacing on the sides of the glass, but half a point only given the aforementioned factors weighing against this one's ability to do so. 
Aroma: Rich, but still somewhat subdued. Smoke, roast, hints of fruit, and a very smooth barrel presence belies absolutely no hint of alcohol spice or heat, even as this one warms, which is a definite plus. There's an interesting juxtaposition here between a lot of light fruity notes - cherries, sour apple, almost bordering upon jolly rancher-ish notes at times - and the deep, velvety smokiness of the malts and (I presume) some hint of barrel char. The latter also obviously compliments the bourbon and other barrel notes, which suggest strong vanilla and hints of cinnamon, along with a persistent but very heavy and low-in-the-register woodiness. 
Taste: A slightly different tasting -bal RIS than I expected, heavy on the extremes. What I mean is that, typically, -bal RISs are bourbon, chocolate, and coffee bombs; and, while this one has all three of those components, none of them really dominate, or are even that prevalent. This one is more about fruit notes at the top of the register, smoky, charred malts at the bottom, and flashes of intermittent barrel notes filling in the blanks. It's unique, a little different, and still pretty good. Deep espresso roast and fudge brownie notes are definitely still present, mind you, but they're balanced by a slew of raisins, figs, cherries, dates, and even berry notes - way high up in the mouth, in a way that leaves that tinge of acidity. 
Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, but what is here is well-embedded, smooth, creamy, and works perfectly with the flavor components. The end result hits all the right notes.
Drinkability: Fantastic. A really solid beer, with a very interesting flavor profile, despite the 14.0% abv. 2,541 charactersCrellMoset, Apr 01, 2012

Hunahpu's snifter
A: Pours completely black. Initially I don't get much head, just a faint ring of dark tan around the edges of the glass. There is some carbonation because I can see it along with the alcohol feet. Some dark lacing sheets on the swirl. Also, this conjures up a little more of that dark mocha head.
S: Smelled it as soon as I opened it. Very pronounced bourbon notes: vanilla and oak aromas. Also pulling some alcohol esters and dark fruits. Rum soaked raisin etc. Some char as well.
T: This is an incredible beer. Up front I get some deep, dark chocolate bitterness on the tip of the tongue. It's like high quality chocolate that you let dissolve in your mouth. In the mid-mouth you get more of the bourbon hints. Vanilla, toffee, and caramel for sure. The flavors really develop as the sip goes on and on. I am amazed that it's as smooth as it is. There is definitely booze there but it's hidden pretty well aside from the normal warming in the back of the throat. The sweetness helps with this I assume too.
M: Full bodied brew. Syrupy mouth coating in a good way.
O: I have to go super high with this one. Solid A moving towards A+ for sure. 1,192 charactersinlimbo77, Mar 30, 2012

Scent is out of this world! Such great bourbon...smells like expensive bourbon. Not sure what barrels were used for this beer, but it's fantastic. Sweet vanilla and toffee as well. Such a smooth, inviting aroma. Taste is just as nice...immediately I get sweet chocolate and vanilla. Then a nice transition into delicious bourbon whiskey with some alcohol flavors and toffee. This beer is sweet, but not overly sweet. At first there was a hint of soy, but as you take more sips it disappears. Great barrel profile with dark chocolate and a hint of coffee. Warm finish. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and very warm from the alcohol...feel it in my chest as it goes down. Drinkability is surprisingly high for such a big ABV. Overall, this beer is stellar. Such an extraordinary imperial stout. 885 charactersDovaliHops, Mar 28, 2012
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A Pours opaque flat black from the bottle and is the same in the glass. Might be the darkest stout I've poured. Very small dark brown head forms that quickly goes away. Some nice signs of carbonation as I play around with it. Although no legs or lacing were left behind the sheer darkness of this beer was astonishing.
S Heavy sweet bourbon scent upfront with chocolate and dark fruits. Bourbon definitely wins the battle of the nose easily but other scents can be noticed easily. 
T Bourbon is very well integrated in this beer. Rich vanilla and wood come through first with waves of chocolate and sweet dark fruits. The finish is sweet malts with warming vanilla-y bourbon heat. This stuff is really nice, and dare I say perfect to sip on. Not quite a 5, but definitely closer than a 4.5
M Medium-ish feel for a stout with very little carbonation. Definitely a sipper. I wouldn't mind a more robust feel on the tongue but I'm not going to complain either.
O This stuff is excellent. Taste is pretty spot on with what I want in a bourbon stout and worthy of the hype. 1,072 charactersGushue3, Mar 28, 2012

Plead the Fifth is in my opinion one of the best imperial stouts out there, including all of the barrel-aged beers. So when I saw that they were pulling out a Bourbon barrel-aged version, I jumped at the opportunity to try it!
Appearance
Black (surprise) with a tan head that did not linger too long. nice lacing.
Aroma
Dark chocolates, coffee roastiness, BOURBON, vanilla.
Taste
That delicious Plead the Fifth base (Roasted coffee, and bitter chocolate) with a great dose of vanilla and bourbon with that oaky finish. Really good! 
Mouthfeel
Nice and heavy, but not so much that you feel like you need to chew. Carries the flavors well. Nicely lightly carbonated and the perfect temp. 
Overall
This may be the best beer I have had the opportunity to taste, especially when you consider that it was this year's release and would more than likely get even better with another year or two! 1,025 charactersindytdmiller, Mar 27, 2012

A: Pours pitch black with a tan head that foams up to about half an inch and quickly disappears just as fast it shows up leaving a small island of bubbles in the middle of the glass. No lacing to speak of. Completely opaque. So dark that the glass actually reflects like a mirror. 
S: Bourbon, and a lot of it, damn. Neat bourbon, vanilla and oak. Nutty and slightly buttery as well. Lots of chocolate and a little bit of roast. Really reminds me of these chocolate bourbon balls that a lady I used to work with made around the holidays. The bourbon smell makes me think booze, but it isn't really boozy at all. 
T: Impressive, chocolatey and vanilla meld together to make a massively sweet beer with undertones of chocolate, oak, and even a slight hop resin profile in there. Huge barrel character in this. Long oaky finish. This is an absolutely massive beer. Massive stout that has a ton of raw bourbon barrel flavor as well. Impressive. 
M: Spot on, thick but not cloying, slight amount of warmth but not hot, and just the right amount of carbonation to make this velvety smooth. Excellent. 
O: Thoroughly enjoyable, easily one of the best BA stouts that I've had. Tons of massive bourbon, but the stout shines enough to make it really interesting. Definitely a beer for whiskey lovers. Glad to try it!

S: Hell of a bourbon hit, but I can still manage to smell the Plead the 5th under it all. Something I find quite impressive in barrel aged beers. Huge toffee/caramel notes on top of a gigantic roasty stout. Notes of wood and tobacco as well. 
T: Wow, bourbon plays so well with this beer. Had this on tap before, but I certainly notice a difference. Sweet bourbon mingles with an already near perfect stout. Sticky caramel and toffee cling to the lips and it ends with a bittersweet chocolate flavor. I find nothing wrong here. Easily one of the best barrel aged stouts I've had.
M: Not even smacked with booze up front, sweet with bourbon notes. Heavy for sure, but the carbonation crisps things up a bit. 
O: Want more, give me more. One of the better barrel contributions to a beer. Works out very well and you aren't hit with a bourbon booze monster or just a meager stout. 1,139 characterskiddynamite920, Feb 29, 2012

When you pour this beer, you know it’s serious. Looks as thick as Bourbon County Stout. You can see the body even before the head billows up from within. The head builds and is a milk chocolate color while the beer is motor oil, including the shine with about 50,000 miles on it. Head does settle to nothing and a scant amount of lace remains.
Aroma is also fantastic. bourbon, CHECK, vanilla, CHECK, dark chocolate, CHECK, a well rounded sweetness pulling all of these together. Double CHECK. Great.
A mellow chocolate bourbon flavor is immediate and then some vanilla. Chocolate returns and there is a nice balance of ABV and some sweetness. You can tell there is a kicked up ABV, but it’s so rounded and smooth it’s crazy. Is this vintage really 14%? That’s amazing. Dangerous beer.
Just a fantastic beer. Loved it from front to back and was sad when it was gone. Have to score another somehow.
I am a little concerned how much this reminds me of Bourbon County. (One of my favorite all time beers) If I ever get the chance, I’d love to do a side by side comparison.
(EDIT - I promise I never looked... I scored this the exact same score as Bourbon County Stout) Too frigging funny 1,304 charactersReagan1984, Feb 26, 2012

P- A black viscous liquid glugs out of the bottle throwing up milk chocolate colored bubbles that don't stick around for too long, but leave a nice lacing of bubbles along the edges.
S- Its hard for me to try and describe to you the complexity of the aroma. This is absolutely incredible. Im just going to name off the aromas as they come to me. Smooth buttery bourbon, chocolate, black licorice, charred wood, super dark roasted malts, little bit of booze, oak, bakers chocolate, butterscotch, caramel, burnt marshmallows, smokiness.
T- Follows the nose well. Front end is sweet on the tongue with a lot of bourbon and chocolate. The smokiness of the wood char comes in strong mid palate for me as the sweetness fades. On the back end there is a profound bourbon and chocolate presence mixed with a lasting fudge aftertaste. Fucking incredible.
M- I served at cellar temp so it wasn't super thick but thick enough to impress me. Great carbonation, a little boozy but, hey...its still young.
O- This is bar none the best imperial stout I've had to date. Would i go so far as to say this is the best beer I've ever had? In this moment, yes, but it could change tomorrow.

A - Dark brown, almost black with a small frothy mocha colored head that settles mostly on the sides. Appears to have a nice thickness to it as I swirl it in the glass
S - Dark chocolate, brandied raisins, caramel sweetness with a hint of bourbon barrel aging. Has a strong and powerful nose that really brings the scents.
T - First there is sweetness as I taste Mexican sugar and caramel. The coffee and more bitter dark chocolate comes next. There is also a strong oak presence where you can definitely see how the bourbon barrel adds complexity. On the finish, wow, that's where you really get the bourbon coming through. It had a strong alcoholic presence along with more typical bourbon flavors of oak, caramel, English Christmas pudding, and brandied dates.
MF - Medium body with light carbonation. The finish is dry and leaves a tingling alcohol feeling. It could improve by being a bit thicker. 
O - A solid and quite boozy BA stout from Dark Horse. The barrel aging adds a lot of complexity to the flavor. I would like it to be a bit thicker and to cover its alcohol a little better as right now it's a bit hot. Curious to see how this develops in a few years. 1,204 charactersjeonseh, Feb 25, 2012

The beer pours a nice black hue with some decent sized tan head and some sticky lacing. 
The beer has great smell but it seems muted out of the 
glass somehow. Some round sweet barrel notes round out done roasty and chocolate stout flavors. Maybe a little licorice abd gum drop spice. 
The taste is more animated and features the aspects of the smell nicely with some great highlights of cigar sweet tobacco, roasty malts, nice bourbon notes with slight vanilla malt, and a little molasses.
The feel is pretty good and a little hot; not that thick but also not offensive.

4.11/5  rDev -8.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks Cam. Poured into a Founders snifter after being slightly chilled.
A - Pours black and a light-tan head forms. It soon disappears and leaves minimal lacing. Sticks to the glass alright. It looks extremely appealing.
S - Dark fruits with light amounts of vanilla and oak. Some fudge comes through as well.
T - Fudge quickly turns into into some oak and vanilla, some heat, then a dry vanilla finish. There is also a little bit of burn once the dryness begins to subside. The oak really makes itself present towards the end. The fudge/cocoa/chocolate is there, but really seems to take the back seat to the barrel. There is a little bit of sweetness, which helps create some balance.
M - Medium body with lower carbonation on the tongue. It does the job with the flavors.
O - The flavor seems a little heavy on dryness and virgin oak for me without providing as much caramel/vanilla as I would expect/prefer. I think if they could pull back the barrel just a little bit, it would surpass what I'd call similar beers. Or, if the barrel would be able to present more charred characteristics. I'd drink it again happily and would be interested to open one among similar beers to see how it stacks up.
7/1/12 Update - Dark fruits are showing up in the flavor, oak is still strong and the heat is faded. If you've been holding any of these for a while, you should really think about opening at least one of them soon. 5/4/4.5/4.5/4.25 1,439 charactersclaaark13, Feb 22, 2012

A- black, much thicker than Plead the 5th, minimal tan-colored head on it
S- very, very sweet...some chocolate and coffee at the end. As it warmed up though I got some vanilla out of it, but overall not the most impressive nose on this one
T- some initial bitterness with the first sip and then tons of vanilla, very smooth, aftertaste of dark chocolate. This tastes great, and you cannot sense the 14% ABV
M- honestly pretty perfect, just the right amount of thickness
O- great stout...top 5 for me and I've had a lot of them. One of the most impressive things was how much the barrel aging process changed the base beer. I thought Plead the 5th was way too sweet and not incredibly smooth, and this is the opposite of that. It tastes very similar to Parabola, just with a much different aroma. I've been a bit disappointed with a lot of BA stouts with hype like this one has, but this beer honestly is worth seeking out. Good stuff 995 charactersmgp2675, Feb 20, 2012
4.01/5  rDev -10.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Got this one in a recent trade with hotpipes29. This one comes eagerly anticipated, so we made quick work of it. Thanks for the trade! 
From a bottle into a mini-snifter
Vintage: 2011
Drunk right after the base beer for comparative purposes
APPEARANCE: Basically the same out of the bottle as the base beer, but perhaps even darker and thicker. A sludgy, thick black pour yields a small, medium looking, slightly bubbly, dark mocha colored head with good retention. Head slowly fades to a bubbly wisp and ring. Thick, opaque black body with no carbonation evident. A swirling wisp and thick ring remain until the end leaving some dots of lacing down the glass. Though the head is a little bubbly compared to the base, this is incredibly thick and menacing. Totally evil.
SMELL: Lots of bourbon on the nose with notes of oak and milk chocolate from the barrels. Quite barrel forward, but some roasted malts and dark chocolate notes do make their way through the barrel aging. Medium strength nose. 
TASTE: Quite barrel forward on the palate with very little of the base beer left over. Bourbon, oak, vanilla and some nice milk chocolate up front. Bourbon barrel dominates through the middle with a touch of roasted and dark chocolate flavors after the swallow. Bold and lingering aftertaste is barrel heavy with lots of bourbon and plenty of alcohol. Very little base beer sticks around. Flavorful, but not much of the regular Plead the 5th is left to be found. 
PALATE: Medium body and higher levels of slightly prickly carbonation. Thick and creamy enough on the palate, especially after it has sat in the glass for a bit, goes down fine with a bite after the swallow. Finishes sticky on the palate and lots of heat lingers. Not as thick and full as the base, but still pleasant. 
OVERALL: This was a really good bourbon barrel aged stout. Despite the slightly milder nose and lighter palate compared to the base beer, the look was outstanding and the barrel flavors were very interesting and enjoyable. Like many barrel aged versions of a base beer, however, the barrel aging on this one has almost completely erased everything that was so enjoyable about the regular Plead the 5th. In that sense, you could say this is a phenomenal bourbon barrel stout, but not a phenomenal bourbon barrel Plead the 5th, if that makes any sense. Anyways, I was stoked to be able to try these together and we really enjoyed the pair. Thanks again for this one hotpipes. This was a lot of fun!
UPDATE: Trying a 2012 and 2011 together tonight. Everything is the same in the 2012, though the palate is a little heavier and creamier. I'd give a solid 4 to the newer vintage in this department. 2,682 charactersJeffo, Feb 19, 2012

Pours black with a quarter-finger mocha head. 
Rich and decadent nose: fudge brownie; toasted graham cracker; strong bourbon presence (with some heat); light vanilla; charred oak and roasted grain. Impressive.
Lots of chocolate notes on the palate, half milky, half dark. Bourbon and fudge. Fairly sweet, but there's an earthy bitterness throughout the mid-to-late palate. It's also pretty oak-forward for a -bal stout; the char is almost spicy on the finish. Still fairly hot -- the bourbon seems to be quality, but it's a bit messy, all things considered.
A little thin in body, with medium carbonation. Appropriately sticky.
Happy to have finally had this. An above-average -bal stout, but a bit hot and messy at this stage to be top tier. 798 charactersVerecund, Feb 17, 2012

A: Pitch black with a nice half inch brown head. The head fades quick into some light bubbles. Well carbed for sure. I think this permanently coated the glass in brown oil.
S: The most vanilla and oaked whiskey I've smelled in a beer since BCBS rare. Huge fudge cake, bourbon, chocolate covered chocolate with chocolate icing. Dark fruit is making this real complex; I would believe it if you told me this is blended with a bit of quad its so fruity.
T: This is crazy good. Everything from the aroma comes through in waves. The alcohol is hidden really well except for in the stomach, it's warming there. The malt shows well through the bourbon, they do a nice job on the base and it goes fantastic with the barrel influence. Moderately sweet, but not cloying whatsoever.
M: Slick, rich, and full bodied. Sticky as hell. Carbonation is pretty low.
O: Chocolate, fudge, smooth/matured bourbon- this is fantastic. BBPt5th is everything I look for in this style. 1,027 charactersschwaeh, Feb 12, 2012

pours a dark, inky black ale with just a little bit of mocha rim. No lace. Aroma bursts from the bottle with cocoa, cake batter, caramel, oak, bourbon, bourbon...did I mention bourbon?
Taste follows suit with cocoa, cake, vanilla, caramels, hints of tannin, praline and even a little bit of....bourbon! I can't believe this beer is 14%, it is sooo well hidden, insane. Really lovely flavor.
Mouthfeel is liquid oil. Really smooth with full body and low carb. Im really impressed with this beer overall. Wish I had more of theses puppies. Damn fine brew. 584 charactersharrymel, Feb 09, 2012

Poured from a silver waxed, 2011 vintage bottle into a snifter. 
Pours a thick as hell, black as hell, viscous liquid that settles and sits like a tar pit. I'm talkin' zero light transfer. There is less than a fingers worth of orange tinted, tan head. Not much lace but a few spots. 
The nose has some complex bourbon notes such as toasted coconut, and vanilla while mixed in the the base brews chocolaty characteristics. Boozy in the end. Wow.
The taste is toasted oak and coconut with a nice amount of bourbon that isn't in-your-face. However, the bourbon shows it's glorious attributes with ease. The base beer still shows through the barrel treatment. There is some chocolate, leather, and tobacco working with the bourbon. There are some firm tannins and oak flavors when aggressively sloshed within my mouth.
Hidden ABV + Drinkability = Awesome
The mouthfeel is what I love about these Plead brews. Velvety smooth with a silk-like feel against my palate. A nice, low amount of carbonation helps this feel become successful. 
Overall, totally awesome, great brew that deserves the hype. This is because of a great balance and a nicely hidden ABV. The durability of the base brew was easily withstandable when put into a barrel. Bravo, once again! 1,301 charactersChugginOil, Feb 09, 2012

Aroma is a pleasing mix of dark fruit as well as heavy roast and toasty malt. A little booze and sweetness as well.
Reflects the nose. Roasted barley, toasty malt, sweetness and some estery alcohol sweetness as well. Bourbon is a nice complexity rather than the main event.
Rich and decadent without being overbearing. Not as intense as BCBS, but worlds better than -bal aged Rasputin. 
Great beer. Reminds me of the best attributes of all of this years Eclipses put together. 542 charactersMrFootstones, Feb 06, 2012

S - Bourbon, wood, raisin, dark and milk chocolate, vanilla, and hints of cherry.
T - Roasted malt upfront with oak, dark chocolate, caramel, black cherries, raisins, coffee and a bit of vanilla and cream. The bourbon is very noticeable, which might be it's only weakness.
M - Low carbonation with a medium body. A rich and oily mouthfeel that coats the tongue. A warm finish, but the ABV is kept in check pretty well.
O - Great BA stout. If the Bourbon wasn't so noticeable this would be an A+ beer. Nothing a little more time can't fix. Glad I got to try this. 707 charactersSkiBum22, Feb 05, 2012

Pours inky black with a medium bubbled cinnamon mocha cover, half an inch thick, that settles to a few islands.
Smells rich and decadent: huge cake batter and dark chocolate, swirl of caramel drizzle, and a spike of alcohol heat that hints at the bourbon.
Where the nose plays coy with the barrel, the taste does not. Tidal wave of bourbon from the get-go. Heat weaves a tight spiral throughout. Abundance of cake batter and baker's chocolate, firm tannins, hops, and a dry finish of fudgey vanilla bourbon.
Body is coating and thick. Carbonation helps lift this to a nice luxurious feel. Hops leaves a lingering bitterness that melds with the bourbon heat.
Overall, this is a really impressive offering by Dark Horse. I enjoyed this significantly more than my previous experience on tap at the Great Taste. A solid ba stout that is impressive as is and stands to potentially age quite gracefully. Well done! 1,058 charactersBarrytheBear, Feb 01, 2012

*From notes
-- Thanks to TurdFurgison & normyk for the hook-ups --
Vintage 2011
A: Pure, unadulterated motor oil. One of the thickest, glass coating beers on the planet. A hearty pour straight down the middle of the snifter yields a tightly packed and dense .5 finger head. Killer retention.
S: Hot bourbon and tannic, charry wood. Immensly rich. Good Jesus is this an angry beer.
T: Wow. It's like a sucker punch to the jowels. This is a massive, complex and jaw droppingly big beer. It's charry up front, which coats my mouth. Hints of crispy vanilla and hard, firm tannin on the mid. The finish is big league booze and gallons of over the top bourbon with a healthy kick of hops. As it warms, the alcohol becomes much more pronounced. In my opinion, this needs some serious time in the cellar.
M: In a category that contains BCBS, KtG, BT and more, this pony holds it's own and then some. Extremely silky - it's creamy and smooth with a luxurious vibe to it. This literally envelops my mouth.
O: Hand this over to your cellar. I'll bet that six to eighteen months will settle this bad boy down, and allow it's colossal amount of potential to shine through. With a bit of time, this could be one for the ages, and something so epic, words won't begin to describe it.
Dark Horse has created a near masterpiece with their BB Plead the 5th. Like John Wayne in "The Searchers", I highly recommend getting on your stallion and tracking this beast down. 1,519 charactersRhettroactive, Jan 29, 2012

The aroma shows a little more of the bourbon and barrel character to it. I get some dark chocolate and brown sugar to it with just a bit of roasted malts to it. The bourbon is nice in it, very smooth. 
The taste really integrates the bourbon barrel flavors into the beer nicely. It has a very rich, dark chocolate, brownie batter like flavor to it up front with a little more of a bitter, coffee, roasty character in the finish. The bourbon is smooth and adds some great complexity with some notes of brown sugar, oak, vanilla and alcohol. It had some really great flavors to it but what really impressed me is how well they balance the beer and barrel flavors.
The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a fantastic beer. The flavors came together extremely well in it and the barrel flavors complimented the beer perfectly instead of overpowering it. This one definitely lived up to the hype for me, one of the best barrel aged beers I've had. 1,190 charactersbillab914, Jan 29, 2012

750mL bottle to Avery snifter
From notes. Thanks Doodler! Your generosity and ability to track down hard-to-get beers is superb. I'm just thankful that I'm around to enjoy such tasty treat and can't wait to return the favor.
A: Deep, dark brown. Barely a quarter (mocha) fingernail head on medium pour.
S: Burnt cocoa nibs, sweet bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, roasted dark malt, and a hint of coffee.
T: Amazing! Deep, complex, dark, and just so smooth. Much like the smell with the addition of raisin, molasses, and toffee.
M: Full bodied and soft carbonation.
O: Truly a wonderful beer! Excellent barrel aging here. I thoroughly enjoyed the complexity and think it is a nice compliment to the regular (base) beer. I could drink this often and think it will age beautifully. 798 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 28, 2012

Pours low carbonation with a very dark brown head that's about a 1/2 finger. Considering the ABV, I'd say it looks damn good.
Aroma is intoxicating- I am swooning. Toasted oak, bourbon, vanilla and deep dark malt. 
Taste... what can I say? This beer is hot and heavy. Lots of bourbon. The base holds up well, though, and the flavors meld. I think this is an improvement on an already great beer. Bourbon drinkers will appriciate this. The toasted oak and caramel/vanilla bourbon flavors do the base beer well. Already a rich stout, the barrels make it opulent.
This one is pretty hot- I really like it although I like hot beers. I think the bourbon is rather dominant but it's not over-reaching. Assertive without being overbearing. 
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good stuff. Thanks, kzoo. 905 charactersShogoKawada, Jan 20, 2012

It is a very dark, though subtle dark tan with a little head.
A nice sweet coffee bean in the nose followed by chocolate bar and caramel, not toffee. Just like a Milky Way.
Vanilla, huge vanilla and then caramel with touches of milky cocoa and chocolate milk. That's the bourbon coming through, although I don't taste too much oak. I get some nice butterscotch dipped vanilla ice cream, too.
The mouthfeel has a bit of roasty bitterness which is nice when paired with the sweetness of this brew. It is creamy, mildly sticky with what I feel is below average carbonation. The Bourbon Barrel version is definitely better, and bolder, than the original. 724 charactersManVersusBeer, Jan 19, 2012

2011 vintage.
pours the customary used motor oil black; a fairly aggressive pour yields an expected short lived mocha / almost cinnamon tone head.
assertive nose offers a wallop of bourbon right out of the gate, which is followed by chocolate and roasted malt characters; secondary notes of vanilla, molasses, and a subtle dark fruit-like presence. 
flavor follows the nose pretty closely. make no mistake, this one is a bourbon bomb (which i live for), but the bourbon doesn't overwhelm the other elements. the chocolate, roastiness, vanilla et al pull through in fine form. delicious. full bodied mouthfeel, velvety more than chewy if that makes sense. some heat but not what you'd expect from a 14% monster.
overall, a stellar imperial stout. almost unfair to lump some of these barrel-aged beers in with the general population, but this one stands out even among other -bals. special thanks to abanton for this gem. 956 charactersperrymarcus, Jan 18, 2012

A: Pours black as night with a decent dark brown head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves the tiniest lacing on the glass. 
S: The nose is really amazing. Big aromas of whiskey, chocolate, vanilla, and a slight licorice smell. The whiskey is really apparent and I like it. 
T: The taste is wonderful as well. Huge flavors of dark chocolate, vanilla, whiskey, roasted malt, and licorice all assault the tounge with each sip. 
M: The feel is damn thick and creamy...about as good as you can get. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen which is incredible for a 14% beer!
O: This is one of the best barrel aged stouts I've had so far. It's huge in all areas. The taste is just a tad bit weak on the barrel notes or else this would be close to perfect. I will say as it warms it vastly improves the taste. Highly recommended! 869 charactersGregSVT, Jan 17, 2012

A: This beer pours black as night with slightly reddish edges. Even with an aggressive pour, there is only a very slight tan head to this. The head recedes quickly. Very little lacing.
S: Booze (bourbon), vanilla, and chocolate. All of the things you would expect from a bourbon barrel imperial stout. I must say that the booze definitely dominates, but there is a very sweet quality about it as well.
T: All the flavors from the nose come together beautifully. The chocolate and bourbon dominate the taste, but not in a boozy way. It is very sweet and sticky. A definite liquid dessert. I am very surprised this is not more boozy. The alcohol is well-hidden.
M: Sticky, creamy, and smooth. The lingering flavors are nice on the tongue. I don't get an overly heavy feeling in my mouth, but the sweetness definitely lingers a while. It does not have that full-coating feeling I have gotten from other bourbon barrel imperial stouts.
O: This beer is fantastic. I love sweet imperial stouts, and this is one of the best. Dark Horse takes an already fantastic base beer and hits a grand slam with it. After having it on draft last week at Ashley's in Westland, I decided to crack a bottle to compare. Draft and bottle versions of this are very comparable and equally impressive. I may even stack this alongside KBS and Black Note. One of the true gems of the Michigan craft beer community. 1,454 characterstravMI13, Jan 16, 2012

Inky black, with a dark, fizzy, cinnamon-colored head.
The nose on this one is decidedly swee. Big showing from the underlying stout here, with notes of sugary chocolate, toast and sweet wort immediately noticeable. Below those is more of the fresh oak and smooth bourbon. 
Flavor’s great. As the aroma suggested, there’s a big showing from the sweet, chocolatey malt. Cocoa nibs, toffee and a big hit of toasted coconuts play off a nice bourbon character. The liquor here is top-shelf. The flavor continues to improve as it warms, eventually getting to where there’s so much coconut and chocolate, it’s like drinking a liquified Almond Joy. With bourbon.
Carbonation is a notch under medium. The tiny bubbles massage the tongue as I move the thick, medium-full-bodied brew around. There’s even a nice tongue-coating action from the residual sugars. Alcohol seems a little bit bigger than is necessary, though. 
A great flavor. Loving the toasted coconut notes, and the bourbon is very well-blended. A tasty, sweet, drinkable stout. 1,181 charactersPhelps, Jan 15, 2012

A - Pours a deep black with a nice chocolate mocha head that dies into a nice foam ring around the edges. Murky clouds in the middle with other hints of foam. Lacing is there but doesn't stick around for too long. 
S - Smells of fresh bourbon, wood, roast and some chocolate. Little bit of vanilla and tobacco leaf, leather and touches of espresso and mocha. Pretty decent smell, but could use a few years of age to be perfect. I'd rank this one a 4.25 but I'll round up since I have a feeling it will reach perfection in a few years.
T - A decent amount of charred oak, roasted coffee/espresso and smooth bourbon. Notes of chocolate, fudge and again, some tobacco leaf. Even though you can tell the bourbon is there, there is no heat to it. Mostly some bitter coffee notes and more of the above mentioned flavors. Even though I like it, I'm going to also score this a 4.25, and since I upped the smell, this one will be a 4.
M - A little bit of sweetness from the bourbon and chocolate flavors, but toward the end this thing starts to dry out the mouth. Again, no burn from the bourbon or ABV. The carbonation is smooth and creamy. 
O - This is a pretty decent BA stout. I really enjoy the smell and taste, but the mouthfeel is slightly off putting. This is the first time I've had this brew, and while I like it now, I know that it'll be the bees knees in a few years. Thanks again Erik for the assist! 1,515 charactersjoshuaseresse, Jan 13, 2012

Bottle to CBS snifter at about 50 degrees. 
A: Easy pour down the center of the glass leads to a half finger worth of tan mocha head that recedes to a very thin ring. Very dark, no light is penetrating this. Looks very good in the glass. The fact that there is head on a 14% stout is impressive in the least. Really nice legs on this. First gave this a 4.5 but after looking at it for a while this deserves a 5.0 or more. 5.0
S: Wow. This smells incredible. Chocolate, bourbon, roasted malts, oak, vanilla, caramel, slight coffee, some molasses and light brown sugar. Hardly a hint of alcohol. 4.5
T: Again truly impressed by this beer. It's super smooth. Very little alcohol bite. Just as in the nose: bourbon, vanilla, a hint of caramel, molasses. As it warms the alcohol becomes more present. Actually prefer this one a little more with slight chill on it. This is one impressive beer. The bourbon and oak is very well integrated into the base beer. 4.5
M: Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy. Good carbonation here. Quite chewy, leaves a slick feeling. Pretty much perfect mouthfeel. 5.0
O: Overall this is a damn fine beer. Very glad I got to try this. I will be seeking out more of this in the future. Thanks to Dark Horse for making more of this and putting it in 12oz bottles. 5.0 1,347 charactersslentz, Jan 13, 2012

pours out complete opaque motor oil black with a dark mocha colored head that rather quickly faded to a thin yet retentive ring. off a swirl, a little sticky lace, but more so some nice legs left on the glass.
big boozey bourbon attacks the nostrils, oaky, woody vanilla, burnt roasted malts, a little dark chocolate and dark fruits. more and more bourbon comes out as it warms.
wow, that first taste almost blew me away. awesome bourbon flavors, big vanilla, more so towards the finish, burnt, dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, burnt marshmallows, dark chocolate cake. really some wonderful bourbon flavors in the finish, for me, thats when the magic really happens. there is such a wonderful marriage of flavors here that i dont even have words for.
creamy, low carb which is nice, big chewy mouthfeel. very warming. silky.
really a wonderful bourbon barrel aged stout. the regular plead the fifth was such a well done impy stout, so i had such high hopes for this and i was definatly not let down. ill definatly seek out more of this for the cellar if possible. great beer, loads of bourbon, still i dont think i can say its better than bourbon county, although extremely close. 1,248 charactersdogfishandi, Jan 10, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle from my favorite MI trader.
Pours pitch black, just like the regular 5th with a small mocha head that recedes slowly to a thin collar with a little lacing.
Aroma is very sweet with lots of vanilla and dark chocolate with a solid bourbon presence. There are some roasted malts in the nose but it's definitely sweet with some molasses coming through, maybe hints of smoke and leather. Gorgeous nose.
Taste is thick and chocolaty with heavily roasted black malts and licorice anchoring the backbone. The vanilla is still there but more subtle than the nose and the wood from the barrel is more prominent in the finish.
The mouthfeel is wonderful, fullish and creamy, with the perfect amount of carbonation, just sticking to the palate after each sip.
The nose is more complex than the nose with the sweetness mixing with the barrel perfectly. The taste isn't quite as nice but it's still excellent. This is a nice example of what barrels can add to a beer. 970 charactersgford217, Jan 08, 2012
4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5big thanks to bierenutz for hooking this one up.
a - pried open the wax and opened the bottle filling my oversized southampton ris snifter. poured a deep ominous sludgy black with a thin creamy tan head that was gone quick leaving hardly a trace that it was ever there aside from some bubbles. swirling the glass brings things back to life, but again, gone quick. lacing is spotty and slippery, but swirls of the glass definitely leaves traces.
s - as soon as i opened this, i smelled the wonderfulness. deep whaf of the glass is HUGE booziness. dark chocolate and fruits from the original are there...but the sweetness of the boozy wood enhances this one quite a bit. REALLY really nice...exactly what i look for in a bourbon barrel aged RIS...boozy magic!
t - yowza, that's a big beer. really roasty. big malt bill with lots of chocolate and even hints of fresh french roast coffee. the bourbon is there as well but much more integrated in the flavor than the smell. after the initial shock of the fullness of the beer, the flavors settle in and the barrel adds a really nice touch. as it warmed it did become a bit of a chore to drink (which is usually the opposite of these kinds of beers for me). perhaps it was the bourbon element coming out more, but i found that it was a sipper and taking my time with it helped at first and then there was a sweet spot that once passed, it was more meh than great.
m - dangerously easy drinker for such a big beer. silky and rich. coats my mouth and leaves a subtle tingle. finishes a tad bitter.
o - overall i wish i had a regular plead to do the side-by-side as i remembered loving it and remember the flavors rich and bold much like this. i'm a big fan of this and glad i have a few more of these and really glad i got to try it and that dark horse made enough to go around this time. enjoyable beer for sure, but not as earth shattering as i had hoped...i actually prefer the 2011 fresh BCBS that i swapped for this, but again, glad to have a few of these to taste over time. 2,027 characterscosmicevan, Jan 07, 2012

A - Poured from a paper bag wrapped 12 oz. bottle, i'm surprised when an oil black liquid spews forth leaving no foam until after the pour when a 1/2 of rich brown foam forms on top. A quick swirl leaves an oily sheen dripping down the sides of the glass

S - Deep rich cocoa, coffee and roasted malts fill the nose, maybe some bourbon in there as well. Very nice smell indeed. No one thing stands out, but meld nicely together.

T - Big chocolate taste with hints of coffee with some bourbon I think, very roasty but not detracting. Just a big hit of chocolate that sticks with you the whole way through. Very enjoyable and makes you go back for more again and again.

4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52011 bottle poured into my colossus snifter. I got this in a BIF today and was so excited I decided to open it up.
Appearance: Pours an opaque black with a half finger layer of cocoa colored head. The head fades to a ring around edge of the glass with just a swirl of carbonation in the middle.
Smell: Sweet roasty malt with some dark fruit and smooth alcohol. I'm picking up some caramel and vanilla from the barrels. There is also cocoa and bourbon in the nose. Very nice.
Taste: This is a really smooth BA Imperial Stout. The slightly burnt roasty malt sweetness hits you first, with some dark fruit just behind. The barrel aging was artfully done. The bourbon and caramel from the barrel are very present in the taste, but not hot at all. The finish is warm and full of bourbon and sweet cocoa notes.
Mouthfeel: On the thick side of medium, but thin compared to what I was expecting. Tingly carbonation with a very slick finish. The beer sticks to you mouth long after you swallow.
Overall: Not disappointed at all. This is a fantastic brew and I plan on having more in the future. 1,090 charactersoline73, Jan 07, 2012

Another top 10 beer for me. A big thanks to Thorpe for letting me have some of this beer during our impromptu epic New Years Day tasting. 
Beer served in a sniffer. Beer is black, oily, this dark brown head of small bubbles, low retention, falls back to halo the glass minimal lacing and low carbonation. 
Aroma is sweet, chocolate, strong malt presence. The boubon come through strong. Mild oak. Smells like a big bourbon stout. 
Beer is medium to big in body, malty sweet with a strong bourbon character. Fudge and chocolate with minimal roast. The sweetness carries through all the way to the end. The bourbon wins in this beer. So sweet, so oaky, vanilla, booze but without heat. I really liked it. 847 charactersdrabmuh, Jan 02, 2012

A: Pours a motor oil consistency with about a cap of creamy brown colored head, maybe a slight red tint, which recedes to a ring. Good retention, no lacing.
S: Wonderfully balanced, mild vanilla and bourbon, oak barrel and associated spices, with dark chocolate and malt undertones. The barrel characteristics come to the forefront as it warms.
T: Airy chocolate cake and fudge, vanilla, oak barrel with some spice, and a touch of bourbon. Some alcohol is noticeable towards the end of the sip, a minor ding on an otherwise fantastic beer.
M: Full bodied and medium carbonation. Wow, amazingly smooth.
O: Great balance, smooth, and really drinkable for a bba stout. The mildness of the beer really increases the drinkability.
---
After 1 year, the 2012 has lost much of the barrel character but is still tasty enough. After 2 years, this has lost all barrel character, some of the chocolate notes, and has taken on more fruit and anise (not in a pleasant way); it's really gone downhill. Overall, I would say that it's at peak when fresh, falls off some after a year, and has gone completely downhill after two years. So drink soon. 1,215 characterspmarlowe, Jan 02, 2012
4.64/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to immobilisme for sending a few bottles of this my way; thanks Todd! One of my biggest wants…I love the normal Plead the 5th so have been wanting to try this since they started releasing it.
a - Pours a pitch black color with one inch of dark tan head and low to moderate carbonation evident. Head only lasts for about 30 seconds and no lacing or retention.
s - Smells of bourbon, rich, sweet chocolate, light bakers chocolate, roasted malts, oak, vanilla, cream, toasted malts, and coffee. While the bourbon is there and up front, it isn't overpowering at all. Very surprised how much sweet chocolate still comes through, but I love it. A really great nose here.
As it warmed up, more bourbon came out in the nose as well.
t - Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, oak, sweet chocolate, sweet dark fruits, roasted malts, bakers chocolate, coffee, fudge, and alcohol. More bourbon here than the nose. Again, really great, though I slightly prefer the nose.
m - Medium body and very low carbonation. Thinner than I was expecting for the look and 14%, but still good for a stout. Would have liked a tiny bit more carbonation too. Weakest point of the beer in my opinion, but it's still good; the rest is just great.
o - Overall I thought this was a great BBA RIS, and an improvement on an already fantastic base beer. I love the normal version and had high hopes for this one, and it did not disappoint. The nose and taste both had a ton of bourbon and chocolate, with the nose having more chocolate and the taste having more bourbon, though for 14% it isn't overwhelming. I think another thing I love about this is that they sold it in 12 oz. bottles. So many great BBA RIS's come in 22 oz/750ml bottles, and cracking a 12 oz. bottle of this tonight was just perfect. Very happy to have another bottle of this. 1,820 charactersmdfb79, Jan 02, 2012

Poured in to CBS Snifter. 
A - Thick ink black with a small amount of bubbly light brown head that very quickly disappeared leaving only a thin ring around the glass. 
S - The barrel aging really dominates the nose up front with bourbon, vanilla and oak aromas. A decent sweetness is evident and cuts through the ABV, which is somewhat noticeable but well hidden given the 14% ABV. Some roasted malt and chocolate notes are hidden in the background. 
T - Follows the nose - big flavours from the barrel aging dominate. Bourbon, vanilla and oak flavours are meld together in a good balance. The characteristics of the base beer are hidden behind the barrel flavours but some subtle roasted malt and chocolate notes come through along with hints of licorice and smoke. The ABV is somewhat noticeable but is complimented by sweet molasses flavours to subdue it well. 
M - Full body, somewhat viscous at times. Light carbonation. 972 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Jan 02, 2012

The beer is near black with a thin, beige cap. The aroma offers bourbon and roast, followed by alcohol, vanilla, oak, chocolate. Great flavor, with prominent bourbon throughout. Additional tastes of vanilla and chocolates. Moderately low carbonation, with a smooth, buttery feel. A bit of heat in the finish, but 14% abv feels pretty nice. Overall, very enjoyable. A top notch barrel-aged imperial stout. 446 charactersHuhzubendah, Jan 01, 2012

2011 batch. Snifter. Huge thanks to Ed for the bottle.
My pants were extremely tight at work today. It was uncomfortable, to say the least. Though, it's nothing I can't sort out over a barrel aged Russian Imperial Stout. Any lapse in advocacy may lead to depression and torpidity. I have much thinking to do, it may require efforts from a bomber of IPA as well.
A: The beer resembles motor oil as it flows forth from the glass when I gently tilt the bottle. The head strikes me as a mixture of russet and sepia. It lingers for half a minute before receding to a small collar of froth around the edges of the glass.
S: Caramel drizzled dark chocolate cake, brown sugar, and big oak notes. Vanilla is light and bourbon is dominant (in a good way). Roasted grains are evident, blending with milk chocolate and alcohol.
T: Liquid dark chocolate, rich and delicious, with a light molasses presence and an upper low earthy bitterness. There's a lot of booze in the flavor, but the taste manages to still be quite good. I get a shadow of caramel and a fair amount of oak with big fudge notes. Bourbon is well integrated. Roasted grains are restrained. Alcohol takes over in the late midpalate and dominates through the finish. It's a bit rough near the end, knocking this from a 4.5 to a 4 in the flavor.
M: Full in body with lower medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is silky, chewy, and sticky.
Overall: Enjoyable, but this is just a bit too boozy at this point. I'll bet this will be excellent in 6 months if it manages to avoid becoming infected like many other barrel aged strong ales. A pleasure to try. 1,618 charactersHopHead84, Dec 30, 2011

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Turdferguson for this one. Poured from a waxed and capped 12oz. bottle into a Darkness Snifter. 2011 vintage. Shared with schen9303. 
Pours a thin, fine layer of chocolate colored head with poor retention. Beer is a dark, dense opaque black. Lacing is stringy and spotty with decent stick. Really oily and slick, thick legs. Decent looking beer. 
Nose is booze, fudge brownie, cocoa, chocolate, and molasses. Extremely aromatic and dense. Almost smells like it looks if that makes any sense. Very rich. Really enticing. 
Opens chocolate, honey, and cocoa. Fudgey and boozy in the middle with notes of molasses sweetness. End is sweet and sticky with some prune notes. Barrel presence crescendos at the finish. Aftertaste is sweet honey, chocolate, and fudge. Really tasty with a very balanced barrel flavor. 
Medium bodied with low carbonation. Oily, slick, and silky in the mouth and warm and smooth going down. Finishes warm with a sticky, lingering aftertaste. Absolute perfection. 
Although this beer has had quite some talk behind it, its still under-the-radar in my opinion. Absolutely amazing and pretty much everything you could possibly want out of a barrel aged imperial stout. I'll definitely be seeking out more of this to lay down. 1,259 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 30, 2011

A- Dark motor oil black body. No light passes through. Served with maybe a thin collar. The thin collar is a dark tan hue. Fades within 15 min and no lacing is left behind in the glas.
S- When you smell this you know that it is quality and something special. Very complex nose. The bourbon is stronggest, but underneath is an even balance of anise, oak barrel, chocolate, currants.
T- The flavor is very similar to the nose. Upfront is some bourbon sweetness, chocolate, anise, and a big chocolate malt background with some oak balance. Some bourbon heat comes through for the finish but otherwise the finish is consistent with the initial flavor.
M- Low to medium carbonatio and a thick, creamy, yet woody stout body.
O- This is a very special beer. It drinks like a 9-10% when its really 14-15%. The Russian Imperial Stout quality and the Bourbon Quality are equal here. Something that is rare in a BBA stout-and the fruit is perfect not over or underripe. 993 charactersPittBeerGirl, Dec 29, 2011

Vintage 2011, poured into my Bruery snifter.
A: Pours a used motor oil looking, completely opaque, pitch black. The only head on this beer is the tiniest ring of a thin mocha coloring along the top of the beer that clings to the glass for dear life.
S: Bourbon, wood, toast, raisin, dark and milk chocolate, vanilla, and just the slightest hint of cherry. Damn, this is exactly how I imagined this beer to smell. It's incredible.
T: Starts off with a nice boozy kick in the face, but all of the flavors of this beer shine through as that first hit begins to mellow. I'm getting dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and wood. The raisin and cherry don't come through in the taste, and I'm fine with that. The finish is milk chocolate, some lingering booze, and a bit of burnt toast. Fantastic.
M: Full bodied beer. It's not over or under carbonated. The flavors are a bit sticky, but nothing overwhelming. It's boozy, but ohh so creamy. 
O: This beer is phenomenal. The hype is totally justified. I can't wait to see how this beer ages! 1,092 characterstrxxpaxxs, Dec 29, 2011

Appearance: looks like old motor oil pouring into the glass and thin tan head forms and quickly dissipates. 
Smell: light chocolate, faint toasted coconut, faint vanilla, and fairly pronounced bourbon notes. 
Taste: Bourbon on the front end with a transition to chocolate milk then dark roastiness reminiscent of the base beer. Alcohol lingers at the very end....and then pure cocoa notes (interesting). This beer is incredibly smooth and drinkable. That all said, I don't find it to be very complex.
Mouthfeel: This could use just a touch more carbonation, but it is hardly to fault for it. This beer coats and chews like a chocolate milk. I love the velvety-ness.
Overall: I enjoy the hell out of this beer. I think that some time will cool the alcohol noted only at the end. 834 characterseyeenjoybeer, Dec 25, 2011

Pours as thick and as black as can be. Somehow this beer seems a darker shade of black than black, as absurd as that sounds. An aggressive pour yields a decent sized dark brown head that doesn't stick around for long at all. A thick ring of lighter brown foam settles at the edges of the glass and stays for the duration. Once the initial pour settles in the beer looks completely still, like 12oz of spent motor oil sitting in the glass. 
Bourbon was detected as soon as the beer was poured from the bottle to the glass. Despite being picked up from a foot or two away the bourbon really isn't overwhelming. The nose is sweet with nice chocolate and roasty aromas. There is a subtle vanilla note and, to even a lesser extent, some wood/oak notes. Kind of surprising that the bourbon is integrated so well with the other characteristics when it was so prominent from a distance. Either way, the nose is exceptional.
As good as the nose was, the flavor is actually a step up. The bourbon is prominent and is present throughout each sip but, like the nose, it's not overwhelming or overpowering. There are excellent chocolate and and vanilla notes that go along with a complimentary roasted character. The oak presents itself as a slightly woody charred character that is tough to pick up, but definitely comes on before a nice, pleasant warming from some alcohol at the finish.
This is a nice big, full bodied stout. Huge, thick mouthfeel with low carbonation. The beer is slick, extremely rich and velvety smooth. 
This beer is amazing. The base beer was already an excellent stout and the nicely integrated barrel treatment take it over the top. I'm not sure when this beer was bottled but it was released just weeks before I sampled it and it is already drinking phenomenal. 1,831 charactersms11781, Dec 23, 2011

vintage 2011.
12oz bottle poured into snifter.
Appearance: dark motor oil black with a dark brown head that is one finger tall. Nice lacing on the side of the glass; this stout stains the glass because its just that dark of a monster! Head recedes into a little bigger than thin cap.
Smell: This beer smells great! The thing that is really setting it apart from other barrel aged imperial stouts is the huge smoke notes mingled in with the mellow barrel notes of bourbon and oak. The smoke note is really meaty type of smoke. It also smells really roasty almost to the point of charcoal.
Taste: This beer starts off tasting like a fairly intense liquid smoke; it bacony and meaty. The roasty malts are found middle palate along with the start of some really smooth and mellow barrel notes. The beer finishes sweet and smokey with a little whiskey kick and mild warming burn in the back of your throat. Its almost like the flavor of charred marshmellows. Little mild sour note is also found in the aftertaste, but its not off putting. The smoke never really backs down throughout the entire time you drink this beer; but its not overpowering or overdone. The vanilla really becomes more pronounced as the beer get to room temperature and begins to balance out the smoke notes.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied beer with low almost moderate carbonation levels. Its just right to deliver a sublime mouthfeel on this barrel aged stout! Super smooth, silky, slick, oily, yet still a bit chewy. Definately a sipper because of the robust smokiness. 
Overall: Great effort by dark horse. This is my favorite beer that I have tried from this brewery. I love smokey dark beers and when barrel notes meet the smoke like they do in this beer its makes a really tasty beer. 1,894 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Dec 21, 2011

App- A good bit of a dark coffee pour into my woodshop snifter. A liquid of molten chocolate brown with some dark brown/amber edges. A small 1/2”-1” head forms a bit of dark brown color and falls very quickly to a nice small ring of bubbles. .
Smell- I opened the base version about a month ago and that thing was Hot. This was more mellow with more of the bourbon coming out and layering it all together. A little let vanilla than on the base version and less granular but that was to be expected. 
Taste- When I first took a sip of this it was more like a candy bar than most stouts I would have guessed it would be. This had a good caramel sweetness with some fresh poured bourbon. On a second sip, smooth chocolatey goodness comes in waves. On the final sips and it's warmed in my hands a little bit the roast flavors come out. A very well done bourbon treatment.
Mouth- A thick bodied medium and bordering on full bodied for me. This also was aptly carbonated and retained a lot of the bourbon and chocolate from the profile.
Drink- I loved the fact this came in a 12 oz bottle. I am a big guy but sometimes I just want one little beer for the day with immense flavor and appeal. This beer was smooth, bold and well layered. I will come back to this one many times. 1,417 charactersFosterJM, Dec 20, 2011

A- Pours a pitch black oil with a thin mocha head. No lacing is left behind. 
S- Oak, earthy bourbon, dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, roasted and hints of coffee and dark fruits including figs and raisins. 
T- Roasted malt upfront with oak, dark chocolate, caramel, black cherries, raisins, coffee and a bit of vanilla and cream. The bourbon is noticeable, but is not as overpowering as I was expecting. 
M- Low carbonation with a medium body. A rich and oily mouthfeel that coats the tongue. A warm finish, but the ABV is kept in check pretty well.
O- Despite how fresh this was, this wasn't overly boozy. The mouthfeel was the highlight as it was the perfect level of carbonation and the bourbon was integrated very well with the base beer. Can't wait to crack some more open in the future. 915 charactersiadler, Dec 19, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep black and opaque body. Two finger mocha colored head sits atop. The head recedes slowly. A substantial amount of lacing is left clinging to the walls of the glass. 
Bourbon aroma is very prominent. Sweet bourbon aroma, rather soft boozieness. Big chocolate and caramel aromas meld seamlessly with the bourbon. Moderate roast and vanilla noted. 
The flavor starts out bourbon heavy before a healthy dose of chocolate floods the palate. A rather assertive roasted malt flavor begins to emerge on the midpalate. The caramel flavor is much more subtle in the bottle version than on tap. Flavors are well integrates though not nearly as much as the tap version. A bit of heat on the back is noted but not obstructive. 
Full bodied Imperial Stout. The carbonation levels are low and appropriate. Very silky, soft texture. The finish is long and enjoyable.
Reviewed from a bottle this time to compare the the tapped version. Unfortunately I do not know the age of the keg, the tap version does seem slightly smoother. Very drinkable Imperial Stout. Despite the heat the alcohol is hidden rather well. Impressive beer. 1,119 characterskzoobrew, Dec 19, 2011

A - Black with a 2-3 finger mocha head that sticks around.
S - Chocolate, booze, bourbon, roast.
T - Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, roast. Very bitter finish that stays with you. A lot of alcohol burn as well which wasn't immediate but lingered for a while.
M - Full. A good amount of carbonation.
I had high hopes for this beer but the alcohol burn coupled with the bitterness made it a bit too harsh. Perhaps it will mellow with age. 451 characterss1ckboy, Dec 15, 2011

A - Pours dark as night black with a small, creamy, one finger tall tan head leaving small streaks of lace down the glass. 
S - Smells of warm bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate, charred wood, and the ever present dark roasted malt. The booze is big up front but the other flavors grow stronger as it warms.
T - Fairly similar to the nose. Hints of vanilla, chocolate, brown sugar, dry oak tannins, and a big dose of booze at the end of each sip. Pretty sweet initially but it gets better as it warms up. It has a ton of flavor but it remains easy to drink.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sweet, boozy, feel that clings to the pallet long after each sip. It developed a little bit of a chalky feel toward the end of the glass..
O - Overall a very good barrel aged stout. It was a little bit out of balance but I had no problem finishing my glass. Glad I finally got to try it. 977 charactersorangesol, Nov 30, 2011

A: Black body. Moderate khaki cap. Spotty lacing.
S: Profound bourbon up front with all of the accompanying aromas of wood and vanilla. Dark chocolate and hints of burnt sugar.
T: Like the nose, this has a strong bourbon component. It isn't overbearing, however. Roasted malts, chocolate and brown sugar round out the profile.
M" Medium bodied, perhaps a little thin in the back end. Moderate carbonation.
O: A very good bourbon barrel stout, but not my favorite option. 513 characterscallmemickey, Nov 28, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served on-tap at Capone's Restaurant for the Black Friday event. Poured into a miniature 5 oz snifter.
A: Deep black body with a bubbly, creamy brown/mahogany head. Moderate amounts of sticky lacing with thick bubbles around the rim. No retention in the center but this is a wonderful looking beer.
S: Loads of matured bourbon, wood, spice, vanilla, maple syrup and hints of pepper. Huge dark rich chocolate malts come through towards the back end. An absolutely incredible display of flavors, exactly what a BA Imperial Stout should smell like. Simply divine.
T: Front of the palate is warming rich bourbon, tobacco, toffee, vanilla and chocolate chip cookie is mid-palate. Finishing are some more wonderful dark malts and a hint of leather. It's not unnaturally sweet but has a some to it; more liquor on the back end. Crazy drinkable, wonderfully complex and seriously delicious.
M: A bit lighter on the body than I'd anticipate but still retains a nice fullness to it. Sticky, rich and a bit of booze going down. Fairly carbonated yet creamy.
Honestly, this has to be one of the absolute best bourbon barrel aged Imperial Stouts I've had to date. The intensity and complexity of the flavors in this beer are missing in so many others in the style. You've got to like, or love, bourbon to enjoy this beer. It's nearly perfect. 1,334 charactersShanePB, Nov 26, 2011

Pours jet black with a thin coffee rim. The nose is a lovely blend of bourbon, vanilla, coffee, and a bit of cocoa. The taste is a perfect meld of the bourbon, sweet vanilla, toffee, and a bit of cherry. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk. Doesn't get much better than this. Has a slightly bittersweet finish that lingers for a short while. This kicked in 40 minutes. A real privilege to try this. 456 charactersRetail1LO, Nov 25, 2011

This is the 6th time I've had this beer (4 on tap, two from bottle (and no infections like the mislabeled Aigre bottle review below))
Looks jet black with a dark brown head. Smell's of bourbon, roast, light coffee & malt. Taste is an incredible wave of bourbon soaked dark chocolate rounded out by a thick malty backbone. Not too sweet & finishes dry & a bit boozy (think 2009 BCS). Full mouth feel, perfectly carbonated and not syrupy like most other stouts/beers of this ABV. One of my top 3 favorite stouts.
An incredible bourbon barrel aged stout to say the least. 615 characterssarro, Oct 24, 2011
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Draft. Sampled at Great Taste. Pours a pitch black brown/black color with a slight mocha bronw head. The barrel and booze is pretty evident in the nose along with the normal imp stout characteristics of dark chocolate and some leather. The booze is pretty in your face to me on this one with it being the first thing I notice upon tasting, followed by the barrel, dark chocolate, and slight leather. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, I thought it a tad hot but otherwise pretty drinkable. 481 characterskbutler1, Oct 23, 2011

4.5 A: Black. Small medium brown head with good lacing.
5.0 S: Excellent duality between bourbon and beer. Sweet leathery bourbon that integrates seemlessly with the stout. Bourbon and barrel contribute a light fruitiness and touches of oak, but leave out any astringency. Super smooth I say. The beer below offers a deep chocolate, moderate roast, and ample caramel. Mild coffee too. Awesome.
4.0 T: Not as comples as the nose suggests. The sweetness is there with the chocolate and caramel, but the roastiness is much subdued. Mild sourishness, but not the infected kind. Moderate bourbon contributions and subtle oak. It's impossible to think that this is 14%. I still don't believe it.
4.0 M: Heavy body, but on the lighter end of the spectrum. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy.
4.5 D: A great beer that would be worth seeking out if they made a reasonable amount of it. 1,010 charactersDavoleBomb, Aug 31, 2011

S- The aroma is awesome, big bourbon aroma, roasted malts, some chocolate and molasses notes, dark fruits (raisins, plums).
T- Big bourbon flavor but not overpowering, roasted malts, nice chocolate flavor, raisins, molasses, a bit warming as it goes down but not too much. Nice oak from the barrels adds a nice quality to this beer. 
M- Big mouth feel, warm as it goes down, smooth and creamy on the finish.
O- Loved it, got to the line early enough to be one of the first to try it, quality Barrel Aged stout that is very drinkable for how high the abv, very happy I was able to drink this. 817 charactersChriscrundwell12, Aug 17, 2011

1.36/5  rDev -69.6%look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 1 | feel: 1 |  overall: 1Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. Thanks to Dunt for the sample.
Appearance: This pours an oily molasses brown, nearly black in the center of the glass. A faint ruby tint in the edge of the glass, but almost no light sneaks through. No head whatsoever, even with an aggressive pour. Uh oh.
Smell: I get the requisite bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate and roasted malt, but there is also a good amount of sour cherry and a little bit of funk that pull the aroma down.
Taste: I would say it is unfortunate that the lack of carbonation really flattened out all of the flavors, but since there is also an unnatural infection in this bottle, maybe not. I can taste a bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and roasted malt, but they are all nuanced behind a dominant sour cherry flavor with some funk as well. The lack of carbonation also makes it difficult for any one flavor to stand out. This is an unfortunate composite of flat flavor.
Mouthfeel: The first problem is that there is no carbonation in this bottle at all. With it being completely flat, none of the flavors are allowed to blend together and come through. The second problem is that by being infected, the body has thinned out, leaving a dry, medium bodied 14% bourbon barrel aged stout in its wake.
Overall: This is a beer I was really looking forward to, to have it flat AND infected was a huge disappointment. 
Note: This IS the bourbon barrel aged version, not the Aigre version that is supposed to be sour. 1,481 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jun 23, 2011

This beer is perfectly balanced. Pours extremely dark, smells of vanilla bean, bourbon, and rich dark chocolate with a hint of the usual bitter stout trappings (licorice, anise, etc) which just add depth. The taste is more of the same, with a huge vanilla bean and dark fruit flavor that is nothing short of incredible. This beer is worthy of the hype on this site and I'd love to see it become a standard in bottles. 489 charactersmfunk9786, Jun 17, 2011

Poured into a snifter the chocolate brown head dissipated quickly leaving no head to speak of, but major alcohol legs were present with each swirl of the glass. Smell on this was great. I must have looked like a junkie with the deep inhales I kept finding myself taking. Lots of deep roast espresso, dark chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. Taste was even better. The integration of the bourbon into the base beer was exceptionally well done. This beer was exceptionally well balanced with great bourbon flavors present, but at no point did it overwhelm the stout. Nice coffee, roasted malt, and smooth bourbon on the tongue, with a great charred oak character right there. Vanilla became ever more present as the glass warmed up. I also got a hint of campfire type marshmallow. All of this had a great coating effect on the palate. I could drink this all the time. Definitely worthy of seeking out, and making efforts to go to tasting events to get a chance to try. Highly Recommended! 1,039 characterssmokeypeat, Jun 13, 2011

Black with a dark brown head that has surprisingly poor retention or lacing, given the base beer. Still, this does look great, and has nice legs. The nose reminds me of dark lord. Big licorice and molasses mildly soy like even, with a big barrel character. Beautiful vanilla and oak with some tannins. Plenty of dark chocolate and dark caramel. Great nose, I almost want to give it a 5
The palate opens with a big boozy heat and plenty of bourbon working well with the chocolate and licorice. Plenty of malt and licorice bitterness as well. Thick chewy and boozy, this beer is sweet and hot on the finish with nice chocolate and vanilla. This is one of those few beers where the heat is well-incorporated in the flavor profile, mostly thanks to the huge body .Not as much soy on the palate, as the nose might suggest. A little overcarbonated, though, but that's personal preference. Letting it warm up and flatten out reveals how awesome this beer is. 986 charactersDefenCorps, Jun 12, 2011

O: this beer is a rollercoaster of flavor, It starts off with the delicious base of plead the fifth and then tacks on delicious bourbon character. This is a rarity worth trying! 673 charactershomebrew311, Jun 12, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Served on tap the night before FoBaB at Local Option. Served aside many other interesting beers, which were quickly cast aside for more pours of this beer. 
Pours black with a thin ring of brownish head. Smell is an intoxicating light bourbon flavor, vanilla, oak, chocolate, roasted malts. The taste is just fantastic. Like the nose, the bourbon treatment on this beer is unbelievable. It is basically the opposite of Rare's deep, earthy bourbon flavor - this is big vanilla, light and playful. The integration of the base beer and the bourbon is dead on. I could drink tons of this beer all of the time. Special beer. Mouthfeel is creamy and lower carbonation. Overall, one of the best few BA imperial stouts I've ever had. Worth a cab across Chicago just to try.
EDIT: Had this a second time at the Great Taste and it was not nearly as good. Dropped the taste -.5 to reflect this change. 892 charactersseeswo, Apr 24, 2011

Not much of a head... oily.. thick staining the glass deep brown brew... 
I had a surprising number of proper pours of this brew over the evening and was increasingly impressed on each one.
Deep dark chocolate with dark malts punctuating the nose.. good oak and bourbon without ever becoming overdone... 
Flavor is brownie batter spiked with dark chocolate covered espresso beans and good bourbon.. vanilla and oaky bourbon... something that I wrote down as toasted marshmallow.. everything is amazingly well integrated ... especially when warmer.
Thick and inviting.. wonderful.. lite carbonation but nobody complained.. I could have easily sat content with this bottle the entire night.

This nice head leaves a subsequent nice lace. The aroma is plum, fig, vanilla, molasses, and plenty of deep roast. The flavor is loads of vanilla and chocolate with plenty of dark fruit and some nice fig and raisin notes with just a mild warming alcohol note. A delicious variation of an already delicious beer. 454 charactersBieresDesMoines, Mar 23, 2011
4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Compared the '11 and '12 next to each other. Pour is jet black with a dark caramel head but not a lot even after a strong pour. Nose is a nice mix of bourbon and light chocolate cake. There are some chalky notes and a bit of booze in back. Taste is more woody, light bourbon. Chocolate notes, faintly chalky but less than the nose. Full bodied and soft, a hint slick with moderate carbonation. Taste gets a little sweet in back and some lingering roasted malts.
The '11 has a richer nose and less sweet in the flavor. More balanced but less bright so you sacrifice a little in flavor expression for balance and tightness. Both are very solid, I would prefer the '11 with the 2 years in it. Rate from the '11. 708 characterscpetrone84, Feb 15, 2011

pours inky black and opaque with a small layer of fine dark brown head. the head quickly drops to a ring around the glass and leaves only a few spots of lace.
aroma is good. bourbon and vanilla. bit of raw oak. coffee and espresso. whole wheat bread and biscuit. dark chocolate. bit of milk chocolate. earthy and woody.
taste is great. similar to the aroma, with more bittersweet and dark chocolate. just under medium bitterness level. espresso. hint of oxidaiton. the barrel is actually farily mellow, allowing the stout beneath to show through.
mouthfeel is good. medium-large body. medium-light carbonation level.
drinkability is good. nie balance. barrel is not all that assertive and works well. 771 charactersgrub, Feb 04, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this at a local beer bar. It had very little head, and even that didn't stick around very long; there was also very little carbonation. The smell was of bourbon, oak, and a well balanced malty sweetness. The taste was of bourbon and oak first with a very slight roast barley bitterness. This faded to a bourbon vanilla sweetness that coated the mouth. Finally, it finished with a bit of alcohol heat, but not too much, especially considering its high ABV. The mouthfeel was thick and rich, coating your whole mouth leaving a malty sweetness that lingers. For a beer this big it is surprisingly drinkable. I couldn't resist getting a second glass, but the alcohol in this drink is well hidden, and could easily creep up on you. 732 charactersRedSpecial1, Jan 25, 2011

Chocolate, roasted malts, hints of bourbon, musty wood, vanilla, black fruits, earthy esters with a bit of leather and tar.
The easiest drinking 14% beer ever maybe. Very balanced, neutral , and creamy. The bourbon barrel aging is very light and not aggressive, I would of liked it a bit more aggressive honestly. Light vanilla, oak, hint of bourbon, chocolate, roasty malts, dark fruits, leather and tar. Very nice. 514 charactersmcallister, Jan 23, 2011

Was impressed with the pitch black color and lacing that this growler pour revealed into my snifter. A beauty on the nose as well with a medium amount of bourbon touched off with some cocoa. The taste with the bourbon, chocolate and some vanilla characteristics from the oak really impressed me with the balance of this stout. The carbonation may have been a bit off due to the growler pour being the last out of the keg when filled, but still was a sludgy, creamy feel. I was surprised that it was around 14% as its drinkability was very high for me without the booziness some ba stouts can get. 695 charactersmistakebythelake, Jan 18, 2011

Pour yields a beer that is near black with a thin whisper of a mocha head without any real retention, just a few bubbles here and there.  The nose brings forward all sorts of delight with nice bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, and roast.  Also, there was a bit of a creamy peanut butter note that I really enjoyed.  The taste wasn't quite as nice and explosive but the bourbon did quite a few great things for the base beer.  Good oak and bourbon throughout, creating a really nice feel.  No hint of the huge alcohol presence. Drinks quite well and my pour was gone well before I had gotten enough of this to satisfy my thirst.  Thanks again, Eric! 811 charactersThorpe429, Jan 05, 2011

4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I had this on tap at the Dark Horse 4elf party. Glad it was on tap as there were very few (VERY few) bottles for sale.
It was served in a plastic cup (boo...), a 10oz pour (sort of boo...), but was delicious (hooray). This was dark, black dark, very opaque with a thin but still existent ring of foam. 
It smells like a big beer, which of course it is, without smelling like alcohol. Strong malty aromas, sweet and roasty, with some dark fruits and a well integrated bourbon. Since having this glass I've had many bourbon aged stouts over the holidays, and I can say that the nose on this one is right up there.
Very very tasty, the bourbon is not overbearing, it really complements instead of contrasting the roasty stout base. Cocoa, raisins, vanilla, bourbon, this is just excellent. No burn in the aftertaste, just lingering sweet bourbon flavors. It feels big and heavy, everything about it says this is a major beer, and you have to be careful or you're gonna get buzzed.
This is especially good considering that you can't taste the alcohol in such a strong beer, and I can't recommend it highly enough. 1,113 charactersTurdFurgison, Jan 02, 2011
4.29/5  rDev -4.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Eric who brought this to our tasting, poured into my Narke glass. Normally, I don't review a beer twice, but the difference of on tap vs bottle justifies it as if its an almost entirely different beer...Black pour with a light tan head, not there for long, ok lacing, but low on carbonation overall...The aroma is totally different, slightly weird. Its all creamy peanut butter with chocolate, actually its really awesome, but has me perplexed as on tap it was tons of vanilla and bourbon. A tad too rich for me, but its good...The taste gets us back on track, more oak, chocolate and bourbon come through, still missing the vanilla though. Finish is bitter, adds to keep the experience interesting. The alcohol is hidden well, creamy from start to finish.
This was good, but not as good as tap where I was blown away. Worth trying for sure, but get it on tap. 875 charactersjrallen34, Dec 29, 2010

A - Pours black, a fingers-worth of tan/mocha head, some good lacing and a thin cap on top which hangs around.
S - Peanut butter, tons of it. Like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Sweet milk chocolate, light on the bourbon, oak, caramels, expresso. All very rich and decadent on the nose.
T - Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, chocolate, some dark fruit notes, oak, smooth bourbon character, coffee beans. I was really impressed how smooth and rich this was for 14%, very well-done. Bitter chocolate finish.
M - Full body, rich, thick, and creamy finish.
D - I never did get to try this on-tap, but I was very impressed with this out of the bottle. Def a top-notch -bal, no doubt about it. Still can't get over how easy this was to drink for 14%. Recommend. 825 charactersSean9689, Dec 28, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at The Comet---
Looks...I expected the barrel version of a favorite big stout to be special...that's why I drove cross town eagar to blow my beer budget.
The first goblet looked like blackness,anticipation,and motor oil,with a few bubles on top that only briefly tried to make a head. By the second pour,all thoughts of Quaker State or Valvoline were gone. I saw the blackness of the universe 30 sec before the big bang,I saw pure bliss in a glass and in my hands...so...I upped the score a bit.
Aromas- Coffee,Molasses,Dark fruit galore,a subtle but clean bourbon whiff.
Taste ....Oh my,Oh my my. The signature Dark Horse malts,amped up for the base Plead 5 with an elegant maze of dark chocolates,dark toffeee,and espresso that dance about,stepping up then back and joining in a roasty stout chorus. The Bourbon is done just exactly so. It neither hides nor dominates, it's like a great bass line in a song,well defined and somehow not getting in the way of the beerness.
Dark Horse has quite a knack for getting flavors to work discreet and distinct yet simultaneously with a seamless flow and blend. Things ebb and flow and it all is done so well.
Here,the Bourbon and barrel play their part, the potent ABV lurks like a subsonic energy,warming but never raw. It's so nicely ASSEMBLED....it makes me wonder how they orchestrated this stuff.
Mouth Spot on. A little stickiness on the lips,but it's good. The carbonation never calls attention....in a lack or an excess. It has good life but no fizzy. The finish is long and elegant with a smooth bitersweet mocha-espresso,sparks of fruit notes and on the other channel,the bourbon and hints of the wood,the oak and a touch of vanilla and char.
Drinkable....I had 3.if I had the money and someone to cart me home,I'd have sucked down more until I became a grinning fool.
the only beers I can compare are KBS and CBS. This better displays the Bourbon,does BA beyond my best hopes.
Since Stout is my main beer and Bourbon my main liquor...this is heaven.
Note...When first done I understand Plead was around 14% abv,but so in could be exported to Ohio (etc) that got lowered to about 13% or a bit less...likewise for Double Crooked Tree. 2,203 charactersrembrant, Dec 11, 2010

Pours black and relatively viscous with a one-finger tan head and thick lacing.
Great aroma, similar to the regular version with a decent bourbon and -bal hints. Dark chocolate, roast, molasses, and anise.
The flavor is rich and huge on the molasses, not unlike the regular version. Rich dark chocolate notes and a good bourbon-soaked wood presence.
Really thick and a little syrupy with very low carbonation.
Great beer. Glad I got to tick this. I love me some -bal aged RISes, and this is a great example. 545 charactersnickd717, Dec 11, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from a small sample, poured on tap, at Heritage Liquor's annual Beer Geek Christmas.
Pours pitch black with a dark brown bubbly collar. Tough to comment on retention and lacing but looks like a classic barrel aged stout. Excellent aroma, full of vanilla and chocolate notes with plenty of sweetness, but no harsh alcohol. Bourbon is certainly present, and dominates the aroma but only in good ways.
Taste is similar to aroma with bourbon shining, bringing a great oak-vanilla element to taste and enhancing the chocolate. Bittersweet with coffee like acidity that was absent in the nose, and seems a little over the top. Finishes clean and bitter. The body is a little thin for my liking and carbonation a tad higher. If this is actually 14% ABV, it drinks amazingly easy!
One of the best examples of Bourbon Barrel aged beers in the sense that Barrel aging has made an otherwise average RIS excellent! Do not pass it up if you ever get the chance to try it! 970 characterstewaris, Dec 10, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had this on tap at Local Option a couple times and at Stub&Herbs on Darkness Eve. This is a beer that I will always seek out whenever it is available.
Appearance- Dark black with a thick and creamy head of foam that sticks around long past most BA stouts.
Smell- The bourbon jumps out immediately and dominates the nose. With some patience the chocolate and roasty malt come out.
Taste- Bourbon, bourbon, and then more bourbon. It is amazing and worth every bit of effort to get. Drinking this beer on draft just makes me want to get a bottle and let it sit for 2 years and see what happens. Chocolate and vanilla are very present along with some oak definitely comes through.
Mouth- Thick and lustrous. Rich with a full coating that makes your mouth want more and more.
Drink- Yea it is heavy and thick, but it is also just so delicious that none of that matters. You can drink all you can handle and it won't be drinkability (more likely alcohol and coordination) that stops you.
I wake up craving this beer, even if I had this in bottles I could never age it because it would be impossible to resist. 1,109 characterscadaugherty, Nov 15, 2010

Jet black with a sticky cap of mocha foam. It sticks around for the duration, and adheres to the sides. Did I mention sticky? Doesn't look all that different from Plead the 5th, it seems to have definitely retained carbonation after time in the barrel. 
Deep fudgy chocolate and blackened, fried plantains dripping in brown sugar syrup. Not overly sweet, but with a vanilla barrage from the barrel. Dark roast and bittersweet chocolate figure large in the equation. Rich flavor, blackened roasted barley, toasted marshmallow, vanilla and chocolate intermingling, with a light sweetness peeking through in the middle. Even carbonation, and with a bigger swig the alcohol is evident, but creeps by unnoticed when sipped. It has an unwavering intensity that is impressive. A solid A+ RIS from Dark Horse. 939 charactersemerge077, Nov 05, 2010

Oily, viscous black with a small dark brown cap. 
The aroma is great - rich dark malts backed by strong but well integrated bourbon barrel. Milk chocolate, fudge, caramel, slight mustiness from the barrel and a hint of tar from the dark malt. Some noticeable alcohol, but no harshness.
Flavors of dark chocolate fudge and scorched malt frolic alongside caramel and vanilla. The body is huge and oily with a low level of carbonation. Tarry, burnt malt lends some balance to an otherwise sweet finish. The lingering sweetness reminds me of Jack Daniels. Alcohol is surprisingly reigned-in, I'd never guess this was 14%.
Plead the 5th is already a great beer, and this is even better. Impressive stuff. 744 characterslargadeer, Nov 03, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is my first review. I didn't really think I'd ever actually review beers on this site as I just use it as a tool. I just felt compelled to make this one my first review, as it was both a surprise and a delicious treat. I had it on tap at a place called The Station Taphouse right near the Downingtown R5 station outside of Philly. 5 bucks for 10 oz. Pretty damn good for Philly prices. I'm doing this the next day from memory, I'll keep it general, don't hate.
A: Dark, Impenetrable. From what I remember not the most amazing head but this is a heavy brew. A little brown foam on black.
S: Heavy malty scent. Slight ovaltine smell in a good way. Vanilla goodness with coffee/oatmeal-ish balance.
T: Awesome. More coffee/choco/oatmeal creamy goodness, with a beautifully strong bourbon flavor, all rounded out by some woody creamy vanilla. Super barley flavor hiding in the back, burnin' your throat.
M: This is the strongest part of this brew. So thick and foamy to start, and then it dissolves on your tongue and throat and leaves you with that whiskey burn. Some may psh-ah the not-to-well masked alcohol, but I don't think it was their intention to be an easy drinker, and I effing loved it.
D: Overall I thought this was too easy to finish. So good, I could have drank two somehow if I wasn't driving. At 14% you're gonna get some burn, but I still think its deceptively drinkable. An unexpected and memorable stout from Dark Horse, gotta give them more credit from now on. 1,487 charactersJamesJSmallIII, Oct 28, 2010

Pours pitch black with the slightlest brown head that fades quickly and little lacing. The scent is of bourbon and chocolate with a hint of vanilla. The taste is bourbon up front, chocolate, toffee, vanilla, and some of the oak from the aging. This tastes incredible. This is thick and hearty and creamy, a great feel for the style with a good light carbonation level.
At a great beer event at the Hulmeville Inn with a great tap list, I started with this and closed with this, with many beers in between. It was good enough to want to go back and have another, despite having many other high ABV beers in between. I can't wait to have this again. 685 charactersstrangefate, Oct 18, 2010

We will not go thirsty without a fight! We're going to tick on! That beer is going to survive to be ticked!" And to those own who were suprised at my travel to taste this rarity I replied: A true ticker is not dissuaded by something as trivial as distance, time, or common sense.
Found on tap at Maple Tree Inn, who knew?
A - Not much more you can ask from the beer than this. Forboding in it's blackness, the mocha head slowly bubbled up, and rose to over two fingers in length. Thick and viscous, this beer left some surprisingly fine lacing on the sides as it slide down the glass. Truly a masterpiece in terms of look.
S - Huge chocolate on the nose with some hidden dark fruits as you become acustom to the smell. The barrel aging brings out a lot of sweet vanilla, which melds nicely with the cocoa. Bourbon is present, but nicely muted, doesn't smell hot at all. 
T - This is quite chocolaty, it is the first thing you notice about the beer. The bourbon plays a strong role, but the cocoa keeps it from tasting hot at all and allows you to enjoy the bits of oak and very present vanilla in this beer. As you continue the drink there is a nice bittering sense of espresso on the end which helps to balance the flavor out. I was disappointed, as this bittering espresso grew fainter the more of this I drank, and I was left with more and more of the chocolate. It still tasted great, but lost a lot of its complexity as it warmed up somehow.
M - Very chewy, but managed to be quite thin on the end. Obviously a full bodied brew. Soft carbonation.
D - This is a beer that can kill you. At 14% it drinks like about something at 8%. I drank this quite easily and found myself having to concentrate hard on putting one foot in front of the other. A great beer that I would love to have again. 2,055 charactersAgentZero, Oct 17, 2010

A- Bourbon 5th is a big ol black stout, it looks dark as night. Really thick looking to, not on the thin side at all. The liquid kinda coats the glass. A very minimal dark brown cap on top not leaving any traces on the glass.
S- While not the most explosive nose on this, 5th remains a big ol roasted malt masterpiece with malts(duh), getting a nice chocolate base with cocco and some underlining vanilla. Dark fruits play a big part in this and bourbon is there but muted. Smells delicious:)
T- Regular 5th is smooth as silk and this bourbon aged one is just as smoooth, if not smoother. The bourbon does not overpower and sort of takes a backseat to the base beer. Chocolate, deep roasted malts, dark fruits, vanilla and some bourbon. This is not hot at all.
M- For the supposed 14% this is not hot at all, no heat whatsoever. Creamy, thick, coating, inviting. Thick bodied, almost barely carbed up. This just glides down. An excellent feel on this bad boy.
D- Ok, 14% is very high and all, nowhere near a session beer. I drank my pint with ease. I would drink more but I have to stay alive, if I was at home drinking this, bourbon 5th would be a all dayer. Im not a big stout guy lately but this one is worth the damage that the alcohol will do over time. This one is a winner and possibly the best bourbon aged stout that I ever had. I drank this along with older vis and bourbon black and this one took the cake. 1,511 charactersBARFLYB, Oct 11, 2010

T- molten chocolate fudge cake and blackstrap molasses. Bourbon soaked vanilla beans with dark roasted malts. Light stone fruit and coffee hit way in the back. 
M- sooo smooth and creamy with a full body and a bit of chew to it. Very lite carb but its perfect for the brew. Just the lightest touch of boozy heat.

Pours black into a snifter, no head and a very small ring of tan foam that sits at the edge of the glass. Smells of sweet dark cherries, vanilla, light bourbon, and milk chocolate.

Mouthfeel is very thick and coating, light carbonation helps keep it from being too sticky, perfect for the style. For a massive, high abv stout, this one is surprisingly drinkable. 554 charactersnkersten, Sep 26, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this phenomenal beer on tap, in a snifter, at Local Option. A tip of the cap to Jim, probably one of the most knowledgeable bartenders in Chicago.
A - Pours pitch black with a creamy tan head. Decent retention and nice lacing. 
S - Smells wonderful. The first thing you smell is the chocolate, wow. Also some roasted malts, vanilla, and of course bourbon, but the bourbon is very subtle. 
T - Damn! This is sooo good! The taste is rich chocolatey goodness. It is so damn smooth. Not hot at all, which is amazing for 14% ABV.
M - This is full bodied, with a rich creamy, silky smooth feel. Almost like chocolate milk.
D - This is eminently drinkable. I sucked two down, and would love another if I had the time and money. 
This is an incredible beer. I almost question the accuracy of the ABV: 14%? Really? WOW! 822 charactersNorthsideFred, Sep 15, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the tap at Local Option in Chicago into a snifter. As a precursor, I really enjoyed the standard version of PTF and had high expectations for the BA version.
A: 1.5 finger mocha head with excellent retention and excellent lacing
S: Bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla were than main smells of this beer. I thought all were in excellent harmony and balance. This is truly a remarkable smelling beer.
T: As with the nose, the main tastes I got were bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate. Wonderfully balance, wonderful flavors, nothing in excess or out of place. This is hands down one of the top 3 tasting beers I have had to date. Better than Dark Lord, Parabola, BCBCS, BCVCS, Ivan, Hunahpu etc.
M: Again, spot on as far as the viscosity and carbonation goes. Not supper thick, but it sits on the tongue nicely, is smooth, and has a wonderful aftertaste.
D: Sky high drinkability. The only thing that could hinder this is the ABV at 14%. With that being said the alcohol was pretty much undetectable to me as this beer was not hot at all.
Overall: This is my favorite beer to date. I was close to giving it my first all 5's but refrained. If I could choose one thing to drink all fall, winter, and spring, this would be it. This beer in every way exceeded my already high expectations and is proof to me that barrel aging an already great beer, if done correctly, can make it even better. I really hope they bottle this at some point. An absolute must try if you ever make a trip down I-94 to Marshall, are in Chicago anytime soon and can make it to Local Option, or at pre-darkness day at Stub and Herbs! 1,614 charactersglazeman, Sep 14, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I had this in a snifter at local option and the strong recommendation of the server.
A: Dark and thick with a decent chocolatey brown head and some reasonable lacing. 
S: The other reviews suggest that the nose only emerges as the beer warms, but even at serving temperature this has a nice roasted nose with coffee and a bit of heat. There may be a hint of honey in there, too?
T: I'll admit I worry when I see "bourbon stout" - they tend to be extremely sweet and thick. But this was advertised as overcoming that problem, and delivered. There's roasted malt, bitter chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and enough bitterness to keep you mind off the possibility of cavities. 
M: As hinted above, this is less chewy than most beers of this style, although it does thicken up as it warms
D: This is no session beer, but it is not limited to dessert and breakfast purposes. 870 charactersdjmitche, Sep 12, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Dark Horse. Served in an 8oz(?) snifter--black with a thin light brown ring of head.
Smell is bourbon, dark roasted malts, and dark chocolate with a light woodiness.
Taste is semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts with the bourbon and wood coming through nicely at the finish. As it warms some molasses-like sweetness begins to come through at the finish.
Full bodied and smooth with a slight chewiness. Becomes slightly syrupy as it warms.
Really great balance of bitterness and sweetness. Just the right amount of bourbon aroma and flavor allows others smells and tastes to come through. One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had.

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On tap @ Local Option
Pours quarter to midnight black with a small deep tan head.
Vanilla, chocolate, molasses, candy and bourbon in the sniffer.
Exact same in the taste and it is a sweet concoction of epic proportions! As it warms, it gets that much smoother. Everything is balanced.
Medium to low carbonation with a chewy, slick mouthfeel. A true sipper for an early fall afternoon. It hides the 14% rather well... but it's still 14%!
Dark Horse has it's lynch pin here. While I quite enjoy Plead the 5th, the barrel wasn't just kind to this beer and to me, it gave it up on the first date, cooked me breakfast and paid for my cab home! 643 charactersrudylaw, Sep 04, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On-tap at Local Option. Served in a snifter. The perfect nightcap for a Thursday night filled with drunkenness and debauchery.
A - Filled to the brim, so it's hard to get a handle on head volume/retention. Thick ring with a bit of film on top, and some spotty lacing as the beverage is consumed. Ominous black body.
S - A lot of dark roasted grain character, with an earthy and fairly mellow bourbon character. I'm not sure what barrels were used, but they certainly seem to be of high quality. This really needs to warm up, and even then it isn't the most aggressive nose.
T - The taste is quite excellent, with a hefty amount of dark roasted grain, caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, and other sweet things. Again, the bourbon makes its presence known through barrel flavors and depth, rather than in-your-face harsh whiskey.
M - Shockingly little warmth for a 14% beast. Full body, with sufficient carbonation to keep it from getting too syrupy. Stick finish, with only light tannic character.
D - This was quite drinkable for the ridiculous ABV. I'm tempted to trek back to Local Option for another pour under more sober conditions. Also, kudos to Dark Horse for enhancing an already excellent beer with tasteful and well-integrated barrel-aging. They've also done a good job keeping the beer from thinning out too much or getting too astringent. 1,352 charactersMasterSki, Sep 04, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap at Dark Horse, served in a snifter.
Appearance is black and oily, with a thin tan head that leaves great lacing. Smells are bourbon, oak, some chocolate, smells delicious. Taste is some sweet malts, bourbon, oak and some smoke, very good. Mouthfeel is sticky, chewy and just enough carb or this style. This beer is really boozy, but in a really drinkable way. I only had one, because it was early afternoon and I didn't want to get too plowed, otherwise I could've had a few. This is a very good beer! 513 charactersLukafer, Aug 11, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this on tap at DH and at Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Fest
Pours 1 finger of creamy dark tan head that has amazing retention. Color is an oil black.
Aroma: Warming bourbon, thick rich chocolate. Roasted malts. The nose is fairly muted.
Taste: Much better here. Bigger bourbon flavors, oak, sweet chocolate, vanilla, caramel, dark fruits, and raisins.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, and warming. Full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends rich, sweet, and malty. 
Overall, a solid -bal aged stout. Great flavors and very drinkable. Very impressed with DH on this one. 588 charactersmothman, Jul 30, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was great starter @ 11 a.m. for our Michigan brew tour
A:Poured into a snifter with harldy no visability throught it, dark along with hints of ruby with a small heads that quickly resides
S:Lots of complexity going on here, from the vanilla to the chocolate maybe some molases. Very inviting
T:Purly Delicious, Lil vanilla and coffee flavor up front then some bourbon on the backburner. Super smooth going down, hard to believe that this one is 14%, almost no alcohol hitting here. Definitly could drink a few of these but probably shouldn't
M:Very nice, a little thicker but very easy drinkability
D: So So good, I'm glad I opened up with this on it got me ready for the next 10 hours of drinking. Easy to drink, great flavors and complexity, and just delicious. I will be heading back to Dark Horse soon and hopefully i will be able to snag this again before its all gone 883 charactersSuperNova777, Jul 30, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap at Dark Horse. Pretty stoked to try this one out. Served in a snifter.
A- Pours a deep dark brown...almost black color. Dark chocolate colored head very little dies to a ring on the glass. Some streaky lacing on the glass. A very nice looking beer. 
S- This has big roasted malt in the front of the aroma. Some light vanilla and dark cocoa in the middle. Don't pick up any wood notes but I do pick up hints of bourbon in the back end of beer. Typical coffee notes as well with a slight smokey presence as well. Light alcohol hits the nose and sticks to it. 
T- Good roasted malt bites from the front with a light vanilla and cocoa ending. Some toffee and coffee notes toward the middle that adds to the sweetness. This beer isn't all sweet though which is where it turns into a bourbon laced beer. Light bourbon notes through the backing leading to a warming alcohol as you drink this one down. There is also a return to light roasted malts to this that add a finishing character as well. This is what a bourbon barreled beer should taste like to me. 
M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is prefect for the beer although I think a little subdue for the style. Nice heavy roastd malts left on the palate with a touch of chocolate. Bourbon and light roasted malts left on the aftertaste. Flavors were bold and clean tasting. Everything mixed together pretty well but still had strong single flavor qualities to it. 
D- This to me was a perfect style of a bourbon barrel beer. The higher ABV (14%) limits this to a couple snifters at best. I do enjoy this beer and hope they do something like making a short bottle run of it. Dark Horse knows how to make their beers very drinkable and I have never had a problem doing just that. Cheers to you Dark Horse! 1,764 charactersalleykatking, Jul 26, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Obviously the first beer I sampled from Dark Horse's living room at the Brewers Guild Fest in Ann Arbor 2010. I was excited to get to try this one as Plead the 5th is one of my favorite beers.
Quite vinous at times but chocolate and bourbon squash that. There is dark fruits, vanilla, oak, chocolate, bourbon and alcohol.
Taste is fantastic. This beer beat out CBS, KBS, Black Note and lots of other big stouts with major hype that were at the fest. We ended up going back for more of this. Our resounding favorite of the day. Theres nothing too frilly about it. Its just a big ass stout with dark fruits, coffee, chocolate, molasses soaked in oaky and vanillay tasting bourbon barrels. 692 charactersMbpBugeye, Jul 25, 2010
