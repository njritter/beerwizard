Had this at a Jackie O's bottle share.  Date, can't remember, didn't write it down, lol.
Pour was about 3 oz.  Looks fantastic, dark as night, nice dark mocha head that is about a finger tall, and sticks around pretty well given the ABV.
Smells like a bourbon barrel stout should, with roast, chocolate, coffee, and booze, and the booze is readily apparent, which shouldn't be surprising with the ABV, but...
GAH!  Rocket fuel!  Roast and chocolate give way to an unbearable fusel alcohol that just doesn't taste good.  Burns all the way down.  I feel like I can light my breath on fire.
Just not pleasant, and this was a 2010 vintage.  I shudder to think what a fresh bottle is like.  Maybe the 2010 was just overly boozy.  Who knows?  I certainly won't go out of my way to find out. 808 charactersKeffa, May 08, 2017

Smell: huge chocolate and big bourbon booziness vanilla coconut slight dark fruit  toffee oak nutty.
Taste: upfront huge malt presence Carmel toffee some nuttiness middle of the mouth big milk chocolate vanilla coconut sweet bourbon dark fruit Plum fig cherry in the finish you get some oak and sweetness with a pretty big booziness that numbs the tongue and warms the chest.
Feel: medium body a little thin but it probably helps this beer. Creamy you can defenitly tell it's a high abv beer. The definition of a sipper.
Overall: This is not a beer for everyone it's 20 percent and drinks pretty close to that. But for a 20% stout I can't imagine a lot of breweries could do this better. 710 charactersMasonz223, Apr 19, 2017

While I didn't have any of my bottles immediately after release in Q4 2016, friends of mine mentioned it was quite heated at that time.  I didn't drink until Feb/March and my experience was wholly different. 412 charactersrmpic82, Mar 29, 2017

A: Pours black with a tan colored head, low carbonation, no lacing, no head retention, looks a little thin for such a big beer and light does come through when its held up.
A: Lots of bourbon, vanilla, charred oak, raisins, slight chocolate, and lots of alcohol coming through. 
T: Bourbon, charred oak, oakiness, vanilla, dark chocolate, alcohol comes through very strong and lingers in the finish, aftertaste is more bourbon, vanilla, dry dark chocolate flavor. 
M: Full bodied with low carbonation, driest imperial stout I've ever tasted.
O: I was expecting more from Black Tuesday, the alcohol is very noticeable and I think its too much as it really masks the other notes in the beer. Bourbon is not as noticeable on the taste like the aroma as the high ABV overwhelms it. If the alcohol was toned down and the beer's other notes were allowed to shine, this would be a lot better. Still enjoyable, a definite sipper.
My recommendation is if you have a bottle, allow it to age for at least two years, then enjoy it. I had Chocolate rain with almost three years on it and it was more enjoyable than fresh Black Tuesday. 1,159 charactersBrolo75, Mar 25, 2017

Poured into a snifter. It is a little less viscous looking than a lot of the other Bruery beers. It is an glossy jet black with a dark brown head that settles quickly into the beer. 
It smells phenomenal. Lots of rich aromas of coconut, vanilla, marshmallow, bourbon, charred oak, chocolate, barley, and raisins/dates. Alcohol is noticeable, but nothing unexpected at 20%. 
All of that gets pretty much squashed by a ton of alcohol in the flavor. It is borderline undrinkable cold. As it warms, you can start to get some charred oak, Rice Krispy treat like marshmallow sweetness, coconut, licorice, and rich milk chocolate, but it is still overshadowed by a boozy burn. It is very rich overall, and reminds me of a Bourbon County beer with the distinct aroma and flavor. Not as heavy of a body though. Between my brother and I, we struggled to drink half a bottle. For what it's worth, I don't think World Wide Stout is nearly as hot and I drink bourbon neat, so I feel like I am a pretty objective opinion. 1,024 charactersWesMantooth, Mar 19, 2017

Very dark brown with a 1 finger thin tan head that fades into thin ring. Active micro bubbles keep the beer swirling and dancing on the surface. Aroma is sweeter malts, chocolate covered caramel with vanilla and bourbon soaked raisins. The taste is dessert like, with caramel covered in milk chocolate. Mocha late with some raisin, vanilla and bourbon notes. Medium feel with soft carbonation and some booziness from the high ABV. Enjoyed this as an all day sipper. 513 charactersRi0, Mar 12, 2017

Look was very dark, practically no head. Wonderful aroma of dark fruit, chocolate, and barrel characteristics. Was expecting some alcohol heat to be evident on the nose but it was surprisingly masked well. Can say the same thing about the taste. Expected this to be hot as hell on the alcohol heat due to the high abv (even with 2 yrs on it), but it was a sweet dark fruit-covered chocolates and bourbon flavor. Impressed! Mouthfeel was a bit thin, a little oily, but still had some minor thickness. Overall, I was very impressed and full enjoyed the taste and aroma on this. I wonder what even more aging would do to this. Worth my time! 668 charactersraspy22, Mar 04, 2017

3.73/5  rDev -16.6%look: 2.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5I'm a bit disappointed in the merely dark brown body and dinky head (hey, it's 20%). I'm not disappointed in the port-like aroma. Subtle undertones of nuanced bourbon (think vanilla, banana, marshmallow, and even coconut) coexist with intense dark fruit qualities. It's a great nose, though it doesn't quite floor me the way I expected. The flavor profile indeed reveals many similarities to port. It opens with incredible tones of fig, raisin, currant, apricot, cherry, plum, and peach. Around the middle is where the bourbon flavors appear. It ends with a powerful (but complex) malt sweetness, some umami, and an also significant alcohol presence. Though the booze is somewhat harsh, it also creates layers of nuance that help compensate for the insane sweetness. Somewhat. The palate is coated with a ton of residual sugar, and that makes it a SLOOOW sipper. Even a tiring one. I have even more qualms about the somewhat thin and firm feel - it's not well suited to the flavor profile. Still, the zesty carbonation IS suited to the aforementioned thin, firm texture, helping to cleanse the palate ever-so-slightly. I really dig many aspects of this, and it's one of the most complex brews I've ever sampled...but I doubt I could even drink half a bottle. It's just way too sweet, boozy, and over the top at the end of the day. I doubt I'd trade for this again, but I'm happy to have finally tried it.

The barrel definitely comes through in the nose but not much else except roast. The taste is one hot boozy mess. Super sweet, barrel, anise and booze. No balance at all. Feel is very thin, especially for the abv. Overall this beer is not good and I do not understand what the hype is. Just a hot boozy mess with no balance and flavor clashes. 393 charactersAmguerra305, Feb 12, 2017

4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5Enjoyed at a bottle share with friends. We had 2010 through 2016, Madeira, rum, and port versions as well as BT Reserve (and I have pictures to prove it). Each was poured from a bottle into a small tasting glass and this review conveys my general impression of the beer after trying all of these. The pour was nearly black, fairly viscous, and sported very little (if any) carbonation. The nose was all dark chocolate, roasted coffee, toasted oak and bourbon.
Full body with a slick, oily feel and a massive, complex flavor. Lots of chocolate up front, coffee, and bourbon. The bourbon intensifies across the palate and adds a tremendous amount of richness to the flavor. The beer is candy-sweet, but not cloying and incredibly drinkable for such a mammoth beer. The alcohol is quite strong, but is well-balanced by the sweet malt and bitter roast. Finishes warm and rich with notes of vanilla, bourbon, toffee, and a little dark fruit.
A beer that drinks like a liqueur. A masterpiece of the brewer's art, no question about it. Insanely rich and flavorful, yet I could easily drink this all night and not get tire of it (at least until I pass out). The base beer must be incredible because I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between the regular, port, rum, and madeira Black Tuesdays. It all tastes the same to me - unbelievably great. 1,349 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Jan 17, 2017

Pours perfectly black with a brilliant tan head on top.  It's aroma is rich of roasted malts, bourbon, licorice, leather, all coming together in a wonderful, warm, boozy whiff.
Lot of barrel flavors compliment dense flavors of malts, chocolate, molasses, licorice, and caramel.  It is easily one of the best tasting beers I've ever tried.  Full bodied with a thick but soft mouthfeel.  This is pure bliss in a bottle. 522 charactersjp32, Jan 10, 2017

This was a 2012 vintage Lot 4.3 - aged approximately 3 years
Domed the full bottle – FW snifter glass - 10.06.15  
The pour is dark shadowy black body without waiver.  Not even some dark brown mixed in.  Sits still in my glass with a only small filmy layer of dark tan foam forming over.  Even it circles out to a halo rather quickly.  Low on the stick factor but with some nice boozy legs to it.  Tons of fudgy bourbon soaked chocolate goodness exudes from the glass.  Sweet molasses, vanilla-coconut, and dark fruits.  The taste is divine as all of the flavors have melded together in lavish decadence.  Gourmet style chocolate with hints of coffee, toasted oak, vanilla cream, caramelized sugars, coconut, dark fruit, alcohol, and some loamy earthiness.  Full bodied with a richly sleek feel.  Not the smoothest beer ever but rather amazing in this moment.  The alcohol is ever present and warming but without any obstruction.  It actually helps cut back all the sweetness along with some moderate amount of bitterness there.  With just 3 years on it this was fan-freaking-tasty!  Maturity is where it’s at.  
I had generally written this one off to the hype train but this has got to be one of the best dessert beers ever had. 1,300 charactersNugganooch, Jan 09, 2017

Although the 2016 is deceptively smooth in its own right, this well-aged variety is a sleuthy son of a gun. Dark as night but not the least bit bitter. You dont get the alcohol upfront or in the back end. Rather, you get that charming belly warming that you might get from a peated scotch. No wonder this thing is so popular. At around 20% on any given year, this beer tastes much more like something in the 12 - 14% range 465 charactersBeanBump, Dec 15, 2016

Very boozy on the nose: whiskey, cocoa, oak, chocolate, cherries, coffee. The taste followed: this is a huge beer and it showed nicely. Smooth balance between the malt, chocolate, and whiskey. Not overly sweet or viscous for it's ABV. A fantastic sipper. 371 charactersBuck89, Dec 12, 2016

this beer is absolutely incredible. any poor reviews are likely due to folks who dont have tolerance for the biggest high abv brews ... its got some heat to it, but thats to be expected as its a 20% abv beer with ridiculous bourbon notes which is why I bought the beer. drinks more like 14% or so. the huge decadent sweetness coupled with massive barrel character is everything I want in a BA stout, and this brew brings it in a big way. 854 charactersHyptochrons, Dec 01, 2016

A:  Pours black with half a finger of sudsy khaki head that quickly fades into a thin ring with no lacing.
S:  Sweet roasted malts, chocolate, candy sugar, vanilla, molasses, oak, dark fruits (raisins, dates, prunes), and booze.
T:  Super sweet chocolate, caramel, and molasses up front with oak and dark fruits  and a hugely boozy finish.
M:  Thick body with low carbonation, this beer is has a sticky sweet and syrupy feel.
O:  A pretty decent beer overall, but I think it would benefit from extensive aging.  Super sweet and extremely boozy, it's more like a fortified desert wine or Port. 609 charactersn2185, Nov 27, 2016

The head fades quickly and leaves no lacing. The aroma is amazing although I detect things that aren't in the beer. It smells like chocolate, vanilla, honey, cinnamon, bourbon, coffee, and fudge. The taste is sweet, chocolate, vanilla and honey notes with a nice bitterness that tastes like it is from dark chocolate. The booze is detectable in this monster beer but does not stand out and it does bring some het. Less than I would expect in a 19.9% beer. This is a truly amazing beer. 566 charactersFriedSlug, Nov 24, 2016

Unless you have a high tolerance for extreme sweetness, I would only recommend opening it in a group of at least four people.  For me, it felt like a stunt beer, and was much less enjoyable than the Bourbon Counties and Parabolas of the world. 361 characterspassam1, Oct 21, 2016

Wow, now that is some serious heat.  The bourbon in this is intense and very strong.  The flavors still shine through (anise, burnt wood) and the vanilla helps to slightly mellow  to booziness.  Overall, a really strong beer that could have used another year of aging. 299 characterspezhead_79, Oct 18, 2016

And just like the show The O.C., this beer is larger than life, populated by good-looking guys and pretty-looking women possessing too much money and too much time and probably prone to killing young teens who are way in over their head (I refer of course to Marissa, who dies in the show (spoiler alert!)). Aged in bourbon barrels, its rich flavor full of caramel, and vanilla, though quite decadent, is actually quite smooth as if to be enjoyed in a smaller tulip glass like a dessert rather than a thirst-quenching porch beer. Drink responsibly, perhaps with a designated backseat driver, and savor the incredibly rich profile while showing your backseat driver how much better your driving is right now, eyes truly awake. Try to detect the subtle wood, bourban, dirt, termite, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, and magnesium molecules left behind from the barrels it's aged in. 999 charactersChristianAlexander, Sep 28, 2016
2.54/5  rDev -43.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 2 | feel: 2 |  overall: 2I have yet to have a single beer from The Bruery that I felt had warranted any of the hype that the beer and brewery had generated, and Black Tuesday really was no different. It falls into the same vein of so many other barrel aged stouts in that it has that similar coca-cola taste that far too many brewers shoot for. The body is too thin, the taste is overly sweet, the heat picks up in an unsettling manner as it warms, the smell is cloying instead of engaging, and I've already explained the taste. 
Please, folks, don't judge this on the difficulty you had getting a bottle, or the hype that everyone else spouts. Instead, take a step back and compare it to other BA stouts. It isn't special, and it doesn't distinguish itself when you set it with other world-class offerings.
Thankfully I did not pay or trade for this, but unfortunately a friend of mine did. Neither of us will make the mistake of looking for this again. 931 charactersAngerhaus, Sep 27, 2016

The nose is caramel, bourbon, roasted malts.  The taste follows suit.  Sweet, but not overpowering, great smoothness and balance for the ABV.  There's a nuttiness in the background that I really enjoy.  I love bourbon notes, and you get a ton of barrel characteristics. 
This monster stout pours a dark brown, whiskey coating the glass nicely.  Thinner feel, but full of flavor. Overall, this beer still stands up as world class. It changes the way you see stouts, and very few beers can do that. 523 charactersDjc410, Aug 31, 2016

This poured out a dark and slightly murky brown with a thin foam cap that fizzled away quickly. Looks more like a bourbon barrel aged barleywine than a stout. The nose was sweet. Raisins and mash dominate. Taste is sweet as well, but not off putting. Just plain, thin feel. The fact that this is an enormous ABV leads me to believe that it will be somewhat "hot", but it isn't at all. I could have easily blindly placed this in the 8-11% range. Pretty enjoyable overall. 486 charactersLloydDobler, Aug 22, 2016

L- Black, thin off-white head that barely lingers. 
S- Holy crap, that's boozy. Keep away from open flames. Behind that's there's a nice bourbon and milk chocolate aroma, The booze faded a bit once it warmed up.
T- Much like the smell, it's very strong. Once you get past that, it's a nice caramel/chocolate/bourbon. Smoother and more drinkable once it warmed up. 
F- Thick, sticky syrup. Very rich. 
O- There's some good stuff here, but the booze is a bit overpowering. I would like this more if it were in the 12-15% range. It was a lot better once it warmed up, a chocolatey and sweet after-dinner beer. 651 charactersZoomslowik, Jul 15, 2016

It reeks of booze but is drinkable and tastes lighter than something like a bourbon county.I wouldn't exactly say this is an enjoyable beer that I'd drink time and time again, but its one good way to have a nice night- 288 charactersTheRossness, Jul 06, 2016

To say that I was excited to have this was the understatement of the century. I can’t think of a beer I’ve wanted to try more than Black Tuesday. A big thanks to Chris for letting my buy one of his bottles. This is going to be good.
Poured a black color with two fingers of fizzy tan head. Serene setting underneath. Decent spotty lacing. Decent retention. (Sight - 3.50)
Smelled sugary milk chocolate, smooth bourbon, toffee, caramel, dry cocoa, chocolate syrup, crayon, licorice, hints of molasses, figs, dark raisins and dark plum. Got boozier each whiff. (Smell - 4.50)
First taste was just awesome, definitely warming all the way down to my gut. Got sugary chocolate syrup, milk chocolate, rich caramel, creamy toffee, smooth bourbon, molasses, black licorice, creamy espresso vanilla and light woody oak. Huge warmth in my throat. Drinks like a port dessert wine or some other complex red wine. This is warm, but not super hot. Definitely drinkable. Amazing. (Taste - 4.75)
Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, surprisingly smooth finish. Perfect. (Feel - 5.00)
This was just incredible. Might be my favorite beer ever, knowing that Pliny the Elder and Younger might come down a tad once I rate them again. (Overall - 4.75)

Appearance- pitch black with zero head.  Exactly what I would expect from a beer this strong
Smell- booze.  I expected this but it is intense
Taste- I get vanilla, caramel up front, barrel late and the booze hits like an iron fist.  It is very evident
Feel-  almost no carbonation.  Slightly syrupy .
Overall-  a special occasion beer I am so glad I was able to try.  But there are better ba imp stouts out there that easier to finish. 534 charactersjcflorian, Jun 05, 2016

This is my first time having Black Tuesday, so I cannot compare it fresh.  However, I've had lots of So Happens It's Tuesday, and honestly it is very similar;  almost indistinguishable.
The nose is filled with wonderful aromas.  The standouts are caramel, vanilla, bourbon and raisin. It is still quite hot and it hit me immediately even after a sizable dinner. Halfway through my first pour, the burn is present pretty much everywhere.  
It is very sweet, and the booze still dominates a lot of the other flavors.  I wish the taste contained more of what I get from the nose, but I think it needs several more years before the booze cools off and the other flavors shine through.
Overall, between So Happens Its Tuesday and 2 year old Black Tuesday, I'm going with So Happens.  However, I think with 5+ years, this thing will be amazing. 870 charactersnawpnawp, May 10, 2016

This was a sublime experience. Black Tuesday pours as dark as the night, and at that you are captivated.  The nose was full of amazing bourbon, chocolate and vanilla. The flavor includes all the nose and some anise and a nice warming booze for good measure. Feel is rich and full.  I found this beer to be similar to some good ports I have had, and that is the way I recommend one approach it. 454 characterspolloenfuego, Mar 26, 2016

Aroma was massive amounts of chocolate and bourbon, just huge.  
Taste was more of the same, lots of vanilla.  Even some tobacco and leather edge.  The godfather of huge bourbon barrel beers.  So many imitators since.
Great with a cigar.  Awesome stuff. 349 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 14, 2016

Appearance:  A one finger mocha head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a pitch black color with no vision of anything. 
Smell:  Vanilla, bourbon, milk chocolate, roasted coffee, and warm boozy alcohol.
Taste:  Not sure what to think about this beer.  It's awesome and I'm speechless.  Some bitterness, lingering booze, and warm alcohol in there too.
Mouthfeel:  Super smooth, creamy, silky, delicious, warm warm booze, and delicious.
Overall:  Probably one of the best barrel aged Imperial Stouts that I've ever had.  Not sure if I'll get my hands on another bottle or sip, but I hope I do. 651 charactersFlounder57, Mar 09, 2016

4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Serving: 1 Pt. 9.4 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. Bottled on 8/25/15, making this just under 6 months old. 
A: Pours a surprisingly light brown color. Would've figured this to be classic motor oil-like, but no. Slim off-brown color head. Kind of murky.
S: Boom. Probably the most bourbon or spirit-forward beer I've got a nose on. Huge bourbon up front, great vanilla and chocolate notes, caramel, almond and dark fruits tucked in there as well.
T: Holy crap. Flavor overload here. Huge bourbon up front again, followed by that chocolate, vanilla, coconut, almond, caramel. Small notes of dark fruits on the finish as well, with some raspberry and dark cherry.
M: Just an assault on the palate. Much like a really good DIPA will hit you with hops for days, this thing is boozy as a mother. 19.9% is no joke here, you get all of it. 
O: Wow, way to make a first impression. I love when a beer really has something to say. This may not be my #1 all-time favorite, but I really have respect for a BA Imperial Stout that steps up and is different. This guy wants to be 19.9% and is definitely 19.9%. The booze may be overwhelming for some, but it really lets the flavors shine and magnifies everything x10. I never had OG Rare, but this is what I envision it to be like because this truly is BCBS on steroids.
Recommendation: This was a long time chase for me and I gave up a lot for it. You should too. 1,426 charactersSparty1224, Feb 18, 2016

2011 vintage, about time I tried this. Solo.
Look: Semi vigorous pour yields a 3/4 inch head that is gone, but for a ring, in a matter of minutes. After ten minutes, the ring is gone but comes back with a few swirls of the snifter. After 20 minutes the ring can not be brought back. RIP.
Smell: I could smell the booze in this as soon as I lifted the cap. Smells of port soaked raisins, dark chocolate, bitter chocolate. As it warms those raisins are still there but with something new, leather and a distant coffee/espresso essence off in the distance. Raisins dominate.
Taste: Boozy fruit cake, chocolate covered, of course!
Feel: At first I gave it a 4, now at 20 minutes in, 3.75.
Overall: Glad I finally cracked this. I really like beers like this that push the envelope. I will be opening my 2013 sooner rather than later AND with someone else! 869 charactersbobv, Feb 11, 2016

A.  Dark black with a finger of khaki head and decent lacing. Good head retention.

T. Fudge, coconut, caramel, molasses, stone fruit, vanilla, and big, fusile alcohol. 
M. Very boozy and very sweet which is the only complaint here. Rich and decadent.

Oaken, vanilla, soy sauce, raisiny port. Old ale or barleywine flavors big time. 4.25
Soy sauce is heavy. Oak, raisin and fig. Caramel and vanilla. Leather and tobacco. And alcohol. Taste resembles a raisin wine from the Dominican Republic. Brown sugar really develops nicely. T- 4.25 M- 4

Pours black as night with a very thiiiiiin mocha head
Smell is intense bourbon and chocolate with coffee behind it all.  Turns more to chocolate as it warms.
There is a flavor explosion in my mother f-in mouth.  Like someone melted a chocolate bar into a good bourbon and mixed in a bit of coffee.  A bit hot but not at all like drinking a 40 proof spirit
Mouthfeel: see above

a stellar take on the style, but also a beast of a beer. glad i got to try it and glad i have another in the cellar to age. 712 charactersAppaZappa, Dec 23, 2015

The flavor is intense and cloying. Bourbon dominates the profile, and the flavor is super rich...there is some vanilla coming through, but that is about it. I am not picking up any oaky notes. I don't taste any malt or hops. All sticky sweet bourbon goodness.  The body is medium, and much lighter than i anticipated. The mouthfeel is bit fizzy, and lacks the creamy texture that i want in a big stout. Carbonation is very low. Overall, i am glad i tried this but i think this beer is more for those who prefer the thrill of the chase, and the novelty of this beer. 671 charactersmmars010, Dec 19, 2015

L - Hazy dark brown. Not black as expected. Khaki tan head that dissapates quickly.
S - A little boozy with toffee and  molasses notes. Definately some sweetness going on.
T - I get molasses, caramel, ripe bananas, pecan pie, and burnt toast. Definitely some heat going on.
F- A bit chewy and can feel some chest heat.
O - Overall this beer is fantastic. Very smooth and balanced.  The high alcohol is masked very well.  Be careful.  It catches up with you really quickly.  I split the bottle with a friend and didn't realize he only poured a glass. By the time the bottle was gone I was really starting to feel it. 687 charactersbrewaddict, Dec 12, 2015

Consumed: 12.4.15
A: 4.25 Pours a very dark brown with a small, light tan head that dissipates quickly. Looks a bit thinner than expected.
S: 4.5 Immediately struck with caramel, raisins, chocolate, vanilla, and quite a bit of bourbon. There are some roasted malt and coffee aromas going on, but they are definitely dominated by the sweeter elements.
T: 4.75 As expected, this is a sweet beer. Still, it’s surprisingly balanced walking the line between strong ale and stout. Like the nose, the flavor has plenty of raisin, caramel, vanilla, and oak. There’s also tons of maple and molasses on the palate too, blending into relatively subtle roasted malt, licorice, and berry character and making the whole experience more interesting. The beer is just slightly dry and bitter on the finish.
M: 4.5 I had the 2014 version prior and felt it was a bit thin. 2015 is much more substantial, almost chewy; it’s still not to BCBS or parabola levels of thickness, but that might help this beer overall. The carbonation is great and the finish almost makes this huge beer feel drinkable. 
O: 4.5 This is a fantastic beer with tons of interesting flavors and aromas. It’s also very impressive how drinkable it is considering it’s nearly 20%. Not exactly the prototype of a BA stout, but definitely a great example of what bourbon barrels can do to strong beers. 1,403 charactersTele, Dec 05, 2015

Wow, did this beer kick my ass! This was the highest ABV beer I had ever had and I felt it. It was well worth it though as this beer was great.
Pour appears somewhat thin but the mouthfeel was super thick and chewy. Maybe the barrel aging thinned out the beer but fortunately it did not affect the mouthfeel. 
The taste is sweet and malty with a huge bourbon backbone. The sweetness I expected with the high alcohol content but what was nice was there wasn't any kind of alcohol burn despite the potency of the beer.
Overall, this beer was probably one of the best 10-15 beers I have ever had. I know I won't get many chances to try this with Black Tuesday not hitting general distribution. Quite the treat. 800 charactersmjpolzin, Nov 29, 2015

I thought the bottle came from the top section of the barrel where the watery part of the beer Flores up. The aroma is unequivocally boozy, with some almond, bourbon, and caramel malt characteristics. The taste is also thoroughly boozy--I had to double check the bottle that I'm not drinking port or amaretto. The taste is of peaches, huge vanilla, biscuity, almondy. Interestingly, no chocolate or roasted coffee whatsoever. The mouthfeel: it burns! From the alcohol, like sipping on soju. 
I was surprised how transparent it is for a self-described "black" stout. I could clearly see the lights through the glass. I felt like I was cheated because of the tenuous stout characteristics. This, and the lack of supporting hops makes me think that this is better classified as a barley wine. Giving the beer a "stout" designation misrepresents its quality and unfairly bolsters its appeal. The only redeeming quality of this potion is the malt sweetness, which makes the alcohol somewhat tolerable. Do not attempt this bottle on your own, as it contains 8.9 drinks--more than enough to send someone to neverland. I would have W00tstout 2.0 or BASS any day over this.

Aromas a charred, roasted malts, sugary bourbon and caramel. Flavor is very roasty with a noticeable, lingering sweetness. Feel is syrupy, but thick enough with a surprising carbonation level. Overall a huge, delicious, memorable beer. 345 charactersstephenjmoore, Nov 21, 2015

I cracked a 2014 bottle at a bible study; was amazed by the smell and struck by the incredible bourbon booziness. Looked at the bottle more closely and realized it was 19.7%.  Simply a wonderful sipping beer. The bourbon smell and flavor is just incredible with a heavy chewy mouthfeel. There is a sweet syrupy chocolate undertone to this beer and the aftertaste just keeps going. This may be called Black Tuesday but I will fondly remember this as Blackout Sunday.  I personally appreciate strong flavors and this one is no joke. Shockingly good. Get your hands on this one, you won't be disappointed. 673 charactersCarb-Overlord, Nov 16, 2015

Dark, pitch black, minimal head. Smell is chocolate, malt, and some dried fruit.

4.91/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752015 vintage, poured in a teku glass at approximately 55 degrees.
A: Pours dark brown sugar color, able to see through the pour. In the glass it's black with light around the edges. Dark mocha head initially that fades extremely fast. Swirling revitalizes the head a bit but the carbonation is limited. Very apparent alcohol legs.
S: Dark chocolate, oak barrels, faint whiskey, plums, trace amounts of cherry, some vanilla, licorice, dark fruits, cinnamon, nutty aromas of walnuts and almonds. Reminds you somewhat of cinnamon oatmeal packets, a rich bouquet of fruit and spices. Caramelized sugars. It really opens up as it warms. The alcohol is more apparent the warmer it gets, but no astringency or booziness.
T: Warm on the tongue right away, it provides a massive payload of sweet caramel, chocolate, bourbon and dark fruit. Just awesome. It really opens up as it gets warmer, providing a really rich experience on the tongue with notes of the various aromas mentioned above. Drinks like a chocolate cake in many ways. Some heat is there, but for such a big ABV beer it is not overly boozy.
M: Big mouthfeel. Sits heavy on the tongue but still very drinkable when you consider the alcohol content. Coats the mouth. This is the definition of a sipper beer. Light carbonation is there, but doesn't play a lot into the overall experience.
O: just an awesome beer. It's got the full chocolate bourbon barrel experience you expected. Absolutely one of the best beers I've ever had. 1,483 characterschrisjws, Nov 08, 2015

A -  Dark dark brown with minimal lacing
S - Bourbon, Oak, & chocolate dominate - slight leather, tobacco, and burn sugar / molasses
T/F - Bourbon start and finish - chocolate coats the mouth and lasts for a few seconds before the raisin, molasses, oak, and licorice flavors come out.  Slight alcohol burn starts 10-15 seconds after sipping.
O - I can see why this beer is setting the standard for a high ABV Imperial Stout.  Can't wait to see what BT is like with a little more time in the cellar.  Prost! 552 charactersBowers-Brew, Oct 31, 2015

4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours an oily, not completely black color with brown-red hints in it, with a small bubbly mohagony head, collapsing to a small lacing. The beer reveals thick alcohol legs after swirling, coating up the edges of the glass. 
Offers an intense nose, consisting of scorched cocoa nibs, molasses and an intense warmth, resulting from the  Bourbon barrel. Bourbon blends perfectly into sweeter, dark and full bodied aromas, revealing dried earth and walnut shell, topped off by a note of cinnamon and wooden vanilla. Very intriguing and well balanced, promising a huge, warming beer.
Drinks surprisingly easy, don't get me wrong, you can tell this is a big beer, but its Bourbon characteristic is amazingly well integrated into the beers overall taste. Drinks expectedly smooth, with a silk, full-bodied mouthfeel, featuring a long lasting warmth, while the taste evolves throughout, challenging the tastebuds in a pleasant way.
Tastes almost instantly of Bourbon, while its presence in the beer is that fundamental, that it only lends wooden oak initially to a foundation of burned rock sugar, wrapped up in a huge amount of earth and bakers chocolate. Develops a spicy, burning but pleasant bite, being far away fom numbing the palate, together with a present oakiness. Cocoa nibs develop more presence, as do vanilla beans, accompanied by a dry, warming Bourbon burn. Bourbon doesn't want to leave the palate at all, while milk chocolate and a note of creamy caramel join in, countering the wooden dryness perfectly. Ends with a long lasting glow, wandering down the throat, accompanied by chocolate, oak and a note of cinnamon.
A unique experience without a doubt. We zipped on this all night, and it took me more than a glass to adjust to the huge body of the beer. After that, it has been a real pleasure to drink it, while I can not confirm that this beer has a relatively thin mouthfeel, which is what I read before more than often. It exhibits a strinking depth and complexity, centered all around well entangled Bourbon, which always saves enough room on the palate for other flavors to unfold. 2,102 charactersaleigator, Sep 26, 2015

Pours jet black with small amount of head with strong bourbon, chocolate, and coffee aromas.  These flavors definitely come through upon first taste with a little vanilla included. The carbonation level isn't too high. With the high ABV, one would think this would feel syrupy but it actually wasn't. Overall, this is a delicious beer and definitely lived up to the hype that surrounds it. I recommend this beer to anyone! Cheers! 475 characterstregan_20, Sep 23, 2015

It's difficult to pull anything beyond bourbon/alcohol from the nose.  The color is jet black and viscous.  The body is not thick enough to carry this much booze.  More of an after dinner drink than a beer.  No carb to speak of.  There's a hint of roasted malt trying to poke through the bourbon character.  This "beer" is a hot mess when compared to other high end bourbon aged stouts. 484 charactersPHBoiler, Aug 31, 2015

Taste is pretty much bourbon and dark dried fruits. Not overly sweet as some have mentioned, but nice chewy feel with hints of caramel and chocolate to boot. 413 charactersbgold86, Aug 08, 2015

Pour - Looks like cola coming out of the bottle and builds as a dark brown / black body with a one finger carbonated tan head. Appears a bit thin from the pour and voids on the head
Smell - Bourbon hits you up front.  Baking chocolate follows and I get some dark fruits as well which turns way to almost a licorice scent. 
Taste - Lot of fruit and licorice up front on this one.  Chocolate isn't as pronounced as it was on the nose, instead I pick up a lot of caramel with a hint of vanilla.
Feel - Mouthfeel is nice.  I was expecting it to be a bit thin base on the pour and color as it came out of the bottle.  Smooth on the mouthfeel and just enough there to allow you to mull it over a bit.  Would love it to be thicker, but nice where it's at.
Overall:  Nice BA stout.  Can tell the booze is there compared to some other high abv stouts, but it is well done.  Good flavor profile and gets better as it warms.  Reminds me a bit of Boris Bairille Aois 971 characters4lo, Jul 31, 2015

The aroma hits of huge sweetness. Marshmallow, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, milk chocolate. Lots of alcohol heat. Almost like a bourbon and sweet chocolate/coffee liqueur.
The flavor follows with that rich sweetness up front. Bourbon, sweet brown sugar, caramel, some bitter chocolate and coffee. This is followed with lots of vanilla, toasted coconut, oak. Alcohol burns as it goes down, but the beer is not very alcohol forward on the palate as sweetness dominates.
Great barrel complexities, but the beer is generally very sweet. A still complex and incredible beer. 700 charactersdar482, May 28, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The Original.  Pours black at night.  Smells strong, but the flavors on this are spot on.  Bourbon soaked raisin sweetness is the best I can do for a simple description.  In my opinion, the best part about this beer is the velvety feel!  It coats your entire mouth and stays there for a while.  If you are looking to try any of the "days" from The Bruery, I would suggest going with this one first.
Edit:  2016 is straight fire!  Loved it! 440 charactersgibgink, Apr 29, 2015

Pretty much a perfect example of the style. Ink black, smooth, not to sweet. The bourbon notes resonate with each and every sip, while not coming off as overwhelming boozy in any way. Sure, this one stood to be even better with age, but six months old still provided a fantastic result. 313 charactersJohnCassillo, Apr 25, 2015

Ended up opening it on the day my son came home from the hospital, which also happened to be my birthday.    Drank over the course of 3 hours at cellar temp.    This is the new gold standard for BA stouts for me personally.    It is very strong, as the abv suggests, but there is a sweetness behind it that brings it into balance.    If I'm lucky enough to grab another bottle at some point, I will split it with someone- I was dragging the next day! 523 characterstmbgnicu, Apr 15, 2015

Good lord this is a beast of a beer.
A- Not super impressive. Typical high ABV stout; little to no head. Basically pitch black, but not the darkest I've seen.
S- GOOD GOD. The aroma on this thing is incredible. This was done side-by-side with BCBS, which smelled simple and boring compared to this thing (and I'm a BCBS fanboy). Sweet vanilla, charred oak, bourbon, licorice. Unbelievable. 
T- I was worried that the taste wouldn't live up to the aroma, but there is no worries here. Wave after wave of dark fruits, chocolate, sweet vanilla, and bourbon. This is not a beer that will "sneak up on you." This beer lets you know its going to dominate you from the beginning.
M- Typical high ABV stout. Pours thick, though nothing like TenFIDY. Low carbonation. Sticky as hell, but smooth. Foams well when swished in the mouth.
O- Need I say more? Best BBA Stout I've ever had hands down. This thing is a monster, so it may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something to blow you away, this'll do it. 1,027 characterspjvie, Apr 06, 2015

4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.752014 version. Poured into a brandy style snifter. 
Pours fairly black with brownish edges when held to the light, fat tan head that sticks around for a few sips with no lacing, but amazing legs like you would find with a fine wine. Aroma is vinous - cabernet, barrel, dark fruit, bakers chocolate, vanilla, coconut - almost like a German chocolate cake soaked in bourbon - phenomenal! Aroma carries over into flavor - very wine-like, a lot going on but all in perfect harmony.......tons of bourbon, but not over the top. This beer is hot, make no doubt about it, but at nearly 20% it's to be expected - the sweetness of the stout works so well with the booziness in this one - again, such a great balance, medium bodied with a dry finish. 739 charactersDeanMoriarty, Apr 02, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A. Very dark brown, some hues at the edges. Thinner than expected and not jet-ass black. A little head develops but retreats to a fine bubble, amber film.
S. I let this warm and at first the booze comes out - similar to wafting a bourbon - so I suggest wafting this. Lets be honest, this piece is almost 20% so it's in a different category. The dominate notes are dark malts and bourbon-soaked charred oak, then you get coco, coffee, and oats. A little vanilla.
T. Here we go. Chocolaty dark malts, bourbon, bourbon-soaked oak, dried fruits (raisins, figs, plums), and coco. This is not hot - for some reason, but the booze is at the end of the palette, not harsh or unpleasant. Kind of straight forward. 
M. Low to moderate carbonation. A littler harsh as one gets to the end of the glass. Full body.
O. I was very excited to trey this and I'm a fan. I have high regards of the Bruery and I think their HIGH-gravity stouts are truly world class. This is a staple of their collection and I'm all about popping the others. Based on how big this beer is, I c=recommend sharing it with some friends. Well crafted. When the time is right, I will crack open my other. 1,166 charactersmacher0, Mar 29, 2015

Jet black body with tan head that slowly fades to a film. Legs but no lacing. Aroma of chocolate, bourbon, oak, roast malt, coconut, marshmallow, and dark fruits. Flavor is moderately sweet with cocoa, brown sugar, and plum notes, but also decently bitter with barrel, booze, and unsweetened chocolate highlights. Full body, oily, thick texture that coats the tongue, minimal carbonation, sweet, boozy hot finish. 521 charactersSierraFlight, Mar 03, 2015

Complex aroma with strong notes of aged chocolate and alcohol followed by a soft vanilla presence and faint caramel.  
Has been quite a while since I've had a beer of this heft, and must say I was unprepared for the frontal fusel alcohol assault. After regrouping and digging in, waves of sweet and dark chocolate were felt, followed by an array of maraschino cherry, black grape, vanilla, spice cake, grain and molasses flavors all slow down the throat.
Syrupy and heavy of course, but quit yer whinin'.
An intricate and challenging brew that takes a few dives to reach its depths.  I recommend enjoying every moment, but don't forget to take your time while ascending for air. 782 charactersstephens101, Feb 23, 2015

Dark as oil, nose of sex, tasty as the day is long and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

A-Few beers will ever look as deadly. A brief glance at the label and you'll know (at 19.7%) this isn't something to take lightly. This beer doesn't have a color, it's strictly the absence of all light. 
S-Huge alcohol up front, almost as if smelling a spirit. Bourbon is slightly there, but is overpowered by the alcohol content of the beer itself. 
T-Husky up front. Lost of malt in here. Hard to pick out a dominant flavor. The bourbon/malt/alcohol is very complex. 
F-Lots of alcohol means this one is a sipper. 
O-Share with friends. 625 characterskylelenk, Feb 05, 2015

Super hot aroma laden with bourbon, mocha, oak, coconut...so much going on.
Flavor is even deeper and more complex. Tons of chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla, coconut...just absolutely delicious.
Incredibly smooth and thick mouthfeel. It's a hot beer, but incredibly smooth given nearly a 20% ABV.
Truly exceptional, delicious beer. 399 charactersRoguer, Feb 02, 2015

Smell-tons of malt goodness, rich coffee, some chocolate, dark fruit, boozy warmth.
Taste-Upfront is sweet malt flavors such as molasses and dark fruit, complimented by rich, toasty flavors like chocolate and coffee. the booze provides warmth but is very, very subtle for a beer this big.
Feel-very heavy, oily on the finish. very subtle carbonation.
Overall-this is an extremely impressive beer, drink carefully, you can't really taste the 18.9 percent abv but it's there! 578 charactersSteveB24, Jan 11, 2015

Smell - Strong bourbon, caramel, licorice, vanilla, sweet alcohol.  It smells strong.  
Taste - Immediate sweetness, and then the alcohol comes through, although it doesn't seem like almost 20% alcohol.  Much of the smell comes through on the taste - lots of caramel, bourbon, and vanilla.  Quite an experience!  This is truly an amazing beer. 
Overall, this is one of the best beers out there.  Not what I would call a typical BA imperial stout - it's clearly in a class of its own. 594 charactersBeersnake1, Jan 01, 2015

Smells like a rich, dark chocolate candy bar, dropped into a pan of hot chocolate pudding, quietly burning on the range. Complexity of this beer is off the charts. I have had several of The Bruery's blended beers that incorporate Black Tuesday, and I've had Grey Monday, but I will freely admit I was not expecting the zany flavors this monstrous brew delivered to me on the first sip. Abundant fig, oak, hazelnut, almond, vanilla, sweet cream, molasses, molten caramel, pudding, semisweet chocolate... I don't know, man. Blown away. Was all ready to be objective about it and then the first drop hit my tongue. BT is entirely worthy of the reputation it has garnered. 698 charactersRothobinide, Nov 27, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -4.9%Considering the Hype on this beer, I had to get a hold of ONE. Scored on the raffle this year, and comp 3 bottles.  
Bottle poured in a snifter glass
A. Poured deep rich black with a hue of amber/brown, little to no head cream in color
S. Toasted charred wood with a hint of bourbon note, light vanilla and caramel in addition bold malt, chocolate, and molasses, which i think hides the most 18% alcohol well yet tingle the nostril. 
T. Had a nice well balance base of chocolate, molasses, and slight licorice. In front was an underwhelming taste of bourbon, but a prominent deep yet not overpowering hint of oak and vanilla that I thought was lovely. On the back, there was a nice touch of charred wood similar to Smoking Wood which didn't pack a strong punch, but linger with a hint of alcohol sweetness and dissipated slowly. 
Mouth feel was fairly balance, but to my taste was a little on the heavy side which can be overwhelming if you're drinking 12-16oz. lovely velvet texture that coats the mouth and smooth
O. Great overall beer, well balance smooth deep roasted chocolate and rich malt. I can see the hype of the beer because for 18% ABV I mention little alcohol presence, but I felt it lacks something, and personally I don't know what that is. To me everything seem like it was blended amazingly well that it was almost near perfection, yet fell a little short and incomplete. It needed that curve ball that tells you DAMN this is one hell of a beer. NO SHOCK VALUE
Will see if my opinion changes after a year in my cellar 
Personal side note
Will I buy it again? Of COURSE; Will I buy 3 bottles? NO (wish they served a 2-4oz taster on tap, smh); Will I join the reserve society to get a hold of this bottle? No 1,730 charactersBeerME_562, Nov 25, 2014

4.66/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Black Tuesday pours, well, black, with a thin and wispy beige head that recedes to a faint ring around the edge of the glass. Thick, vinous legs on this one, too. The aromas are intense: heavy, heavy alcohol presence that's a lot like straight bourbon (though the alcohol aroma settled substantially as the beer warmed up); dark red fruit like raisins and cherries; chocolate; and a very nice oaky vanilla. Flavors are a dream: sweet, booze-drenched chocolate; spicy alcohol heat; caramelized brown sugar; vanilla marshmallows; more vanilla and molasses; more of those dark red fruits; and a faint char or roastiness on the finish. There's almost a sherry- or port-like flavor to Black Tuesday, which transforms this beer into one fit not only for mortals, but also for the gods. Mouthfeel is not thin, but not as viscous as I was expecting. It's just smooth, substantial, and exactly right for what's going on with the flavors. There's definitely a bit of alcohol burn, but this seemed to dissipate as the beer warmed up.
Overall, Black Tuesday is one of the best straight BA stouts I've ever had, maybe slightly ahead of BCBS and slightly behind the king of the roost, Parabola. The flavors are rich, complex, and hard to capture adequately with words. If you're a BA stout fan, you'll love this one. 1,303 charactersblankenhoney, Nov 23, 2014

After having had the 2014 recently, I'll add that the aging really cut through the heat for me and made this a really enjoyable beer.  Love it fresh too, it's just a lot. 261 charactersBeer4B, Nov 20, 2014

S: A big mix of sweet dark chocolate, raisin and bourbon that meld together really well. For a beer this huge, the alcohol doesn't really scare you off in the smell.
T: This is fantastic. Tons of rich dark chocolate and bourbon notes with a touch of chocolate covered cherry, raisin, port and char. A huge beer, but it's really smooth and there's no real burn at all, which is pretty crazy. Definitely deserving of its reputation. 566 charactersnotchucknorris, Nov 18, 2014

Bourbon chocolate and sweet raisins. it's a sweet beer but not overly sweet. this absolutely blew me away. i can not smell or taste the alcohol for the 19.7%. I would have to say this is the best bourbon barrel aged imperial stout I have ever had. 429 charactersgrimholm, Nov 13, 2014

Poured a pitch Dar k even in a 5oz tulip & didn't allow any light through. 
Bourbon jumps up & out. Followed by chocolate, slight vanilla & burnt sugar. 
Some much flavor depth, but get dark chocolate, bourbon, and sugary sweetness. 
Fantastic beer overall. The epitome of what a barrel aged stout should be. 349 charactersalerivers, Nov 05, 2014

Wonderful strong rich aroma with well set contribution from the BBL
Flavor, a bit more BBL but plenty of other flavors too including a strong molasses note.
Well hidden ABV - drinks like 'just' 10%.  Very smooth and mild for 19.2% ABV. 260 characterschinchill, Nov 04, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.9%2012, poured dark as the night, smell of bourbon, cholocate, slight vanilla and a bit of booziness.  Taste was much of the same characteristics, bourbon up front, sweetness, but not cloying, and rich stout.  A slight bit of booze, but no burn and not overpowering.  Definitely a monster beer. 292 charactersMLDucky, Nov 03, 2014
5/5  rDev +11.9%Enjoyed a 2010 at Darkness Days this year.
Pours a black, toasted marshmallow head- amazing laces in the glass.  The aroma is pure bourbon.  It is incredible how the bourbon aroma held up.  Dark Chocolate, Toffee, Caramel, and Blackberry also present in the nose.  Taste reveals a medium-body stout.  Matches the nose perfect- bourbon forward, with nice dessert hints as it warms.  NO WAY is this 20% ABV.  Hides it perfect.  I think that BT is great fresh, or with 2-5 years of ago- something we happens during that ~1 year mark- but before and after that it is sublime.  If you can snag this vintage, do.  
Cheers! 618 charactersbitterbeerguy, Nov 03, 2014

A: Pours dark black with less than a finger of khaki head. The head is very thin and reduces very quickly to practically no collar. 
S: Strong aroma of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and a fairly pungent alcohol burn. In the back I get dark fruits, vanilla, and roast. Needless to say there's a lot going on here. The heat is not a surprise, but still worth mentioning. 
T: The chocolate and bourbon are what I get as the boldest flavors. Fading in the background are vanilla, coffee, molasses, and roasted malts. At 18.9%, I expected something complex and bold, and this delivers. Very enjoyable, and as a bourbon fan, I have to say this bring the bourbon notes along very well. 
M: Moderately low carb level, but high enough to keep from calling it syrupy. Leaves a very sweet after taste that helps cover up the heat. 
O: This is a delicious beer, one that I'd recommend to any craft beer nerd who is also into bourbon ( which is almost every craft beer nerd I know).  Lots of heat going on as expected, but the aroma and flavor pack the punch to make this an all around enjoyable beer. 1,163 charactersroger617, Oct 25, 2014

2014, from bottle. Big bourbon aroma and very sweet, malty taste. Medium but sticky, syrupy body. Feels more like an English Barleywine than an Imperial Stout. Expected something else but overall it was very enjoyable. 4.6/5 454 charactersCiocanelu, Sep 19, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6.3%First off, huge thanks to Derek (@2beerdogs) for the chance to sample this gem.  His beer karma is much appreciated.  
Aroma:  Big raisin and plum notes abound.  Low woody notes and strong bourbon character up front.  No hop aroma.  Big dark fruit and licorice notes abound.  I love the well knit character of the dark fruit aromas, licorice, and woody notes.  The smell hugs my nose like a warm blanket.
Appearance:  Inky black pour with a moderate-low tan head.  The head retention is good.
Flavor:  More dark fruit with a big sugary molasses character.  Low woody notes as in the nose with a background bitterness and slight roast character to provide a counterpoint.  Hints of vanilla emerge as it warms.  The finish is clean and dry.  The balance is definitely malty with wonderfully knit flavors and amazing depth.  The aftertaste is lingering and slightly woody.  
Mouthfeel:  Medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation.  Silky on the tongue with a tinge of alcohol heat. 
Overall impression:  While still exhibiting the character of a wood-aged Imperial Stout it also reminds me of a well-aged English Barleywine.  There is depth to this beer that shows different layers each time you sample it.  Truly an amazing feat.  This is the best barrel-aged beer I've had.  A treat worthy of all the hype. 1,316 charactersmattcrill, Aug 31, 2014

Caramel, chocolate, fig, anise, bourbon, and dark roast coffee on the palate. Some alcohol burn. Full bodied with little carbonation. Overall this beer is a monster best sipped. Quite delicious. 307 charactersJohnG190, Aug 18, 2014

2013 bottle poured into a FW Teku on 7/4/14. Happy birthday America!
A: Dark black with ruby highlight when held up to the light. Not as pitch black as I expected. Small tan head recedes to nothing after about 30 seconds, per usual for a BA beer with this high of an ABV. 
S: HUGE milk chocolate, caramel, and boozy bourbon notes. Hints of dark fruits and a slight alcohol burn close things out. Just a massive nose, the usual BA stout characteristics turned up to 11.
T: Syrupy sweet caramel and vanilla upfront. Pleasantly boozy bourbon and toasted raw cacao notes from the malt followed by a note of raisins. Extremely complex, but bordering on too sweet. Surprisingly limited alcohol character.
M: Thick and syrupy with low carbonation. Ridiculously mouth coating viscosity only adds to the decadence.
O: A ridiculously flavorful BA stout. Unbelievably pungent in every sensory aspect, but somehow manages to stay relatively balanced. Every bottle is a treat. 989 charactersMore_betterness, Aug 07, 2014

A- Pours a very dark brown, which is much lighter and clearer than I expected. Pretty much no head.
S- Boozey nose, but that's expected. Rich and oakey.
T- Woahhh bourbon all the way through. Sweet vanilla and chocolate notes down to the burn from the booze. This beer is huge in every way. Almost a little spice character in there along with lots of dark fruits.
M- Thick and velvety, rather than aggressive. Light carbonation.
O- This beer was just a pleasure to drink. 667 characterstviz33, Aug 03, 2014

Pours up black with brown edges. Quickly fading brown head. Nose is chocolate malts, booze heat, raisins, black cherries, caramel. Tastes of all of the above, huge bourbon and oak, and then some. Thick bodied, smooth mellow carbo. Insane! 287 charactersstumac, Jul 20, 2014

4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours lighter than expected, but still damn near black in color. Chocolately brown colors in the body near the edges with a very small head, that is more of a thin film on the top of the beer.
S- Big notes of sweet vanilla and bourbon right up front. The booze hits next on the nose with an oaky spiciness and plenty of heat. Dark malts, including coffee, chocolate, and burnt malts finish out the scent with a sweetness mixing in with oaky spiciness.
T- Starts off with a sweet bang of chocolate and vanilla flavors. Oak flavors and bourbon come next with some burn, but not as much as one would think. Creamy chocolate flavors come right after the burning sensation. Last flavor on the tongue at the end here is a blend of sweet and spicy chocolate and bourbon.
M- Thick, creamy, and boozey all the way through the drink, but surprisingly easy drinking and doesn't quite feel as strong as the label says. This will definitely put you under the table, but is so smooth and silky, it is almost a welcome feeling.
Overall, this is a great beer, but I'm not sure it is worth the price tag and the effort to procure. Still, a great beer that I would seek out and drink again. 1,179 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jul 19, 2014

Pours a deep, dark black, with a small, quarter inch head, and not much lacing.
Smells like bourbon, chocolate, booze, caramel, and more booze.
This one is a whopper, so much here. Surprisingly, the booziness is not overpowering- it is hot as hell, but that factors in well with every other flavor, and elevates it a bit. Tons of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, burnt sugar, oak, coconut, cream, molasses. All of those flavors combine together so well into this flavor punch to the face. 
Thick bodied, so gloopy and viscous. The mouthfeel is so chewy but creamy. Low carbonation. Due to the alcohol, this one is a real slow sipper.
Glad I finally got to try this one, it's a monster, but a delicious monster too. Treading the line between beer and cognac or something. 817 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jun 22, 2014

***2011 Vintage***
Thanks to Masterski and F2brewers for each getting me a bottle. Not sure who gave me this vintage.
Poured from a 750ml bottle and enjoyed last Tuesday ;)
Thick, viscous, black body. Surprisingly, some frothy foam in the pour but dissipates quickly. Aroma is stellar; rum cake, ,molasses, sweet bourbon, maple syrup. Aroma jumps as soon as i uncap the bottle. Flavor follows the same path as the aroma. Fudge cake, bourbon, maple, maybe not as intense as the aroma. Very sweet and that's a lot coming from me. Feel straddles the line between beer and spirits. Very special and happy to have had the chance. 654 characterspapat444, Jun 12, 2014

The only way to improve this would be to age it with cacao nibs and vanilla. 270 characterskirok1999, Jun 11, 2014

Got to share this awesome Bruery's Black Tuesday at a Alchemist Heady Topper tasting that I did in Chicago on 6/5. After the Heady Topper was gone, the guests dragged out the Bruery's Black Tuesday bomber and a couple of 12 ounce bottles of the Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Shout.
Both beers were top of the line brews, but I would give the edge to Black Tuesday. Just a total joy to consume; especially with all my new friends that came to share my Heady Topper Tasting. 562 charactersricknelson, Jun 09, 2014

S: Syrupy if you will: caramel, vanilla, & dark fruits. As well as bourbon and some chocolate
T: Dark fruits, vanilla accompanied by a coffee/dark chocolate texture. The bourbon & booze content is there, but I wouldn’t say it’s overwhelming. 
M: Soft, easygoing, comfortable, and particularly smooth are the adjectives I’ll use to describe what most 19% beers are not. 
O: When drunken leisurely, you’ll find this to be quite scrumptious…Definitely in there with the top of its class, when taken into consideration the content and style of the beer. 640 charactersM-Fox24, May 21, 2014

A- pours pitch black with little head that fades, no lacing.
S- At first open and pour there were faint chocolate notes giving way to dark fruits and booze as it warmed.
T- Served slightly chilled, dark fruits and slight chocolate notes. As warms dark fruit and booze start to come out becoming very prevalent. 
M- very thick, fills the pallet and goes down smooth.
O- this was well worth the KBS I traded for it. This easily goes up with the best barrel aged stouts easily available each year. 542 charactersJared14, May 17, 2014

The fact that this is a really good beer is completely overshadowed by a pretentious, conceited brewery with rude employees. Unfortunate, but that kind of pretentious nonsense is repulsive to me. Lots of great beers out there, enjoy it if you want, then move on...it is not all it is made to be. Overpriced... 
Enjoyed a bottle of this with my brother on 19 April 12. We chilled the beer for a while, but probably cooled it down a little more than we should have. I prefer some of these bigger stouts with a slight chill, and sometimes close to or right at room temperature. This beer started out really strong on alcohol...the alcohol almost overpowered the flavor and taste of the beer. We probably took about 25-30 minutes to go through the bottle, and by the time it warmed up closer to room temp it was getting really, really good. The last sips were the best. I have another bottle of BT and will be drinking it a lot closer to room temp (60 degrees or so).
A: pitch black
S: Licorice, alcohol, figs, molasses 
T: See above, at cooler temps alcohol smothers underlying flavors, takes away from the beer
M: silky smooth, very thick
O: really nice...can't wait to enjoy another!! 1,215 characters4thelvofbeer, May 12, 2014

Smell is dark malts, lots of chocolate, and a little tiny bit of booze that hard to notice.
Taste is tons of dark malts, tons of chocolate like no other beer I have tasted, definitely a little heat but nothing that I don't like as I love to drink bourbon clean so this is nothing.
Mouthfeel is huge. Really thick. Maybe the thickest beer I have ever had. 
Overall this is a great beer that I have never had and definitely would love to drink again. 548 charactersTheBeerDrinker, May 10, 2014

The aroma is chock full of raisins, maple syrup, dark chocolate, coffee, a mild roasty note, vanilla, bourbon, and some toffee. On the palate, the beer feels thin and finishes hot, which is to be expected of an 18-19% ABV beer such as this. However the flavors are rich and intense, with the same notes as evident on the nose. 441 charactersjbaker67, Apr 27, 2014

T: Similar to the smell. Big boozy beer with lots of biter fruits. Not as much coffee/caramel/bourbon as expecting, but its not lacking. Very excellent. Doesnt taste like 19% either, thats not to say you cant taste the alcohol but it works well, it tastes strong, it works well but doesnt taste like im drinking 19%.
M: Oily and coating. A great thick feel, it coats the mouth.
O: I have had this beer sitting in a beverage cooler for about 5 months, anticipating opening it. I finally opened it, it wasnt what I expected (I was expecting more bourbon), but it was amazing in what it was. 804 charactersSumdeus, Apr 18, 2014

Review #1000!
Vintage 2010
Pours a wicked dark black color, no light getting through this, not even at the edges, smallish head that fades very quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass.
Huge notes of dark fruit, especially fig and raisin, even has almost a chocolate sherry aroma, subtle hints of wood, bourbon is quite prevalent on the nose as well.
Taste starts out with a bourbon burn, even after almost 4 years of aging this still packs a punch although it's not nearly as bad as when I first tried it a few years ago, quite sticky and sweet although the sugary aspects have also mellowed out and allowed the dark fruit to have a large presence, carbonation is low but more than adequate for this style and is very soft on the mouth, finishes with a very sticky feeling.
To be honest, I didn't care for it the first time. It was way too sugary sweet and burned too much as well. It's still very strong in both of those arenas but have considerably mellowed out and allowed other flavors to come through. Overall, a good choice for my 1000th review as it demonstrates a good usage of cellaring. I think I'll sit on my 2011 bottle until I hit 1100 reviews (at my current pace, it might be awhile). 1,251 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Mar 30, 2014
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A - As advertised: Black as night
S - Bourbon front and center. Then oak, dark fruits, almost like a chocolate-covered cherry.
T - Bourbon dominates with dark fruits. A really sweet beer, but even after you get past the warming sensation that engulfs your chest, it actually is pretty damn smooth for being over 18% abv.
M - Thick with decent carbonation
O - High expectations weren't quite met, but this is still a good barrel-aged stout. You really need to be a fan of sweet beers to like this one. Served at room temperature this is a bourbon-soaked dark fruit stout with some balls. Very good, but in my opinion (and I can't stress enough: MY OPINION) it didn't live up to it's reputation. 697 charactersThrewRedButter, Mar 29, 2014

Appearance - Dark brown colour with a small size frothy head. There is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is some faint lacing. The head lasted for around 3-4 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Malts, chocolate, grains, coffee, wood, booze
Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and faint coffee. There is also quite a bit of booze and some vanilla and wood.
Overall - One of the booziest beers I have ever had.. but this is not a bad thing. I was expecting this to be cloyingly sweet, but instead it still manages to remain quite drinkable especially given the ABV - not that sweet at all either. Definitely a good bottle to share and worth seeking out. 771 charactersspinrsx, Mar 25, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bottle: Poured a clear light dark black color ale with a nice dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of rich thick black chocolate notes with light molasses and some roasted malt is quite sublime. Taste is an incredible mix of thick black chocolate with some roasted malt and some light molasses. Body is quite full with good carbonation and surprisingly no alcohol is easily apparent. Light oak and vanilla notes can also be detected. I was expecting somewhat of a messy overly sweet beers bit this is actually very smooth with plenty of complexity. 576 charactersPhyl21ca, Mar 24, 2014

2013 vintage poured 3/2014
Pours a deep dark brown, but still see through which surprised me; short ephemeral brown head. Big nose of chocolate, big dark roasted malts, massive bourbon and vanilla and some hot alcohol. The taste is so smooth and balanced especially for such a big beer, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, roasted malt. The body is big but doesn’t reflect the 19.5% ABV with low carbonation for a silky smooth stout. Overall and incredible balanced and deep stout, wow! 546 charactersmtomlins, Mar 21, 2014

To preface i was cery skeptical of this beer tasting like straight up liquor because of the alcohol content. 
A- jet black with very very little brown head that turns into nothing very very quickly. Man this looks good. Getting lost in its appearance.
S- bourbon. Sweet caramel and vanilla. The chocolate comes through at the end and sits in the nose for a good while. The smell is very very sweet almost like candied soy sauce. Sounds weird but it's very good.
T- chocolate with hints of coffee. The coffee is very faint but the chocolate leaves a bitterness like dark chocolate does on the tongue. Then te bourbon comes in and swirls around the mouth. The booze is hot but it blends so well with the malt and chocolate. The sweetness from the bourbon doesn't overwhelm the flavors at all. This tastes amazing. Can't find anything wrong with the taste. 
M- incredibly smooth for a 19% beer. Not much bite from the carbonation either. Can't believe how smooth it is.
O- a very delicious beer that really captures the style. Gotta drink it slow though. Very hard to find something wrong with this beer. If there was anything it would be the heat from the alcohol. But even that is done so well for a beer that is almost 20%. To me this beats out BCS because the sweetness from the bourbon blends way better in this beer. Glad i have another bottle. 1,379 charactersmlhyatt, Mar 16, 2014

Great deep black with some tan head, decent legs, not much for lacing. Hot hot hot. Even with a year on this, the bourbon heat is alive and well. Aroma is boozey up front, vanilla, toffee, and molasses behind that bourbon heat. Taste is also very boozey. I get the vanilla, some faint dark fruit (raisin or something of the like), some good oakiness. Slightly thin in the mouthfeel, but I enjoy the low carbonation and fairly thick body. 503 charactersmverity, Mar 10, 2014

The well hidden ABV sneaks up on you and before you realize it the bottle you shared with a few friends is empty and your stumbling about. I cant say enough about this beer as it is one of the best beers in the style I have ever had. If you like BB stouts this is a no brainer with a fantastic stout backbone coupled with the barrel aging makes this treat Legendary.
Bottom Line: Legendary brew! 505 charactersthemind, Mar 10, 2014

Definitely excited for this one and has been on my bucket list
A - Dark as night with a tan finger head
S - Smell comes through as roast, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and bourbon as this barrel really comes through. You would expect this out of the high ABV
T - Definitely the best part of this beer as the bourbon really was not too powerful. The character of the barrels balanced extremely well with the vanilla, chocolate and roast flavors. This is the best 18+% beer I have had
M - Medium bodied for sure with low to minimal carbonation which resounds perfectly with this beer
O - Definitely one of my favorite stouts. I would not put this at the top, but it is hard to improve on this beer. Would love to try the variants some day 814 charactersdrmcleod10, Mar 06, 2014

Smells big and intense yet tasty even to me. Rather intense/big taste but still felt smooth to me over all. The taste, to me, didn't seem to linger on the tongue so long that I couldn't taste anything else, which was a nice difference to me at least. This baby is big and can slap you in the face at 18-19% but if you're a fan of stouts and bourbon barrel aging, definately get this. 512 charactersSound_Explorer, Feb 28, 2014

A: Black, can't see through it when I hold it up to a light. Two random litte patches of light tan bubbles linger on the surface, other than that there are little signs of carbonation.
S: Booze and chocolate mostly with bourbon and oak being second. I could smell this one the second the seal from the cap broke.
T: Lots of boozey flavor but no burn! Its intense but well balanced out by the chocolate, more of a milky sweeter chocolate, and bourbon. Hints of vanilla and maybe a bit of caramel in the background.
M: Very very thick, maybe the thickest beer I've had up to this point. Its pretty amazing!
O: Seems like this beer is a huge hit or huge miss for a lot of people and I have to say it was a huge hit for me. Its not as sweet as I expected and the alcohol is actually far less detectable than I had anticipated even though it plays a pretty big role in both aroma and flavor. Really nice beer. 955 charactersanteater, Feb 07, 2014

Everyone passed it up because they are all liquor drinkers so I was thrilled to pick it up! Poured this into a small tulip for tasting purposes. I live near The Bruery, about 15 minutes away or so and I have a big problem with their beers. They are going bigger and stronger only. There is no intricate 5% ABV beer in the tasting room, only beers above 10% ABV. That's not my style but I'm going review this fairly and not allow my prejudice to get into it. 
Appearance: Black as it gets, this is really dark and has a slightly tan head that diminishes quickly.
Aroma: A slight chocolate hint with a bourbon aroma. there is also a big alcoholic aroma to this. It's intricate though at least, there are undertones of caramel and maybe some sort of rock fruit like a prune or something.
Mouthfeel: This is thick, it is almost like it's got cream in it. It's kind of crazy how much booze in this, I can feel a burn the entire way down to the stomach.
Taste: Booze booze booze. What little flavor of bourbon and chocolate is there is really overpowered by booze but that's what this was intended to be so OK. I'm not a big fan of this beer but for someone who wants a big strong beer, this is it. 
Overall: Again it's a Bruery beer. I'm not impressed with the flavors that they developed, I'm more impressed that they created a beer that was 18.9% ABV. This isn't my style but I'm not going to give it poor marks because of that. It is what it is, it's a super strong beer that has a slight chocolate flavor with a hint of bourbon. 1,607 charactersBeerEngineer, Feb 01, 2014
4.34/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 25 oz bottle into a Bruery snifter glass. Acquired in a trade from vitese, thanks buddy! One of my biggest ISOs.
A- Upon the pour a chocolate brown, translucent stream enters the glass, exhibiting a deep brown body with a 1 finger light mocha colored head that reduces slowly to leave a brown ring of foam. Little lacing. 
S- Upfront come big aromas of bourbon, vanilla, maple, and molasses. Upon further evaluation, he background reveals aromas of caramel, toffee, and coffee. I get some boozy aromas every so often, but any 19% beer that doesn't smell like booze is not 19% alcohol.
T- Sweet milk chocolate and caramel upfront, next up next is coffee and a roastyness. Super sweet.. a syrupy fudgyness that coats the tongue. The finish is somewhat roasty, charred. Boozy but not too boozy. 
M- Rich, thick, low carbonation. The definition of a sipper. 
I was really looking forward to Black Tuesday, and it did deliver. It is on the sweet side, so if you don't prefer sweet stouts this probably isn't for you. I was expecting something more dry like BCBS, but nonetheless the flavor profile worked for what it is. Share this one or split it over a few nights, it's a meal! 1,193 charactersgcamparone, Feb 01, 2014

3.79/5  rDev -15.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75I'm pretty sure this was a 2012 bottle, consumed Jan. '14. Dark brown-black pour, no surprise there, topped with a thin brown head that receded to a ringlet; minimal lacing. Aroma was fairly sweet, notes of dark chocolate and vanilla, pretty hot with bourbony booze, licorice, brown sugar, some dark fruits. But the booze was the dominant factor. Fairly sweet up front in the taste (not quite Dark Lord sweet, perhaps), lots of booze, bourbon-soaked oak, bitter dark chocolate, licorice, tobacco, dark fruits, more subtle vanilla, the oak and herbal hops came out a bit more in the finish, and even more so as it warmed. While this was definitely pretty hot and boozy, it still drank fairly well, considering the extremely high ABV. Body was on the fuller side of medium--might as well just call it full--with a slick and somewhat unctuous mouthfeel. A decent brew overall, but doesn't really live up to the hype (welcome to the Bruery). I can get a World Wide Stout at my local shop and experience pretty much the same thing this beer offers (or better), in a better package (aka smaller bottle) and for a better price. 1,120 charactersRifugium, Jan 26, 2014

750mL bottle. Pours a pitch black viscous color with a 1/2 inch of brown head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is a whole lot of booze with some nice vanilla, oak, raisins, dark chocolate, black coffee and earth. The taste is boozey with a great chocolate presence that somehow isn't overpowered by the bourbon. Vanilla hints with some caramel as well. Chocolate and alcohol burn towards the end. More warming alcohol at the finish with dark chocolate. Almost tastes like boozey Hershey's Syrup. Heavy, chewy mouthfeel. I'm surprised that the taste is so complex given the very high Abv. Its not just a boozey mess. Probably one of, if not the best, Barrel Aged Imperial Stouts I have had. Amazing beer. 734 charactersPicoPapa, Jan 23, 2014

Aroma: Amazingly complex aroma. Initially it smells a bit boozy but also has a good amount of chocolate and oak with a bit of vanilla at the end. 
Appearance: Motor-oil black, pours thick with just a touch of head if you pour correctly. If you pour carefully anticipating head, you won't get any. Alcohol legs on the glass.
Flavor: A bit of alcohol heat, but that is to be expected. Oaky, chocolatey, coffee, vanilla, molasses, a confusingly slight hint of something almost fruity that I couldn't quite pinpoint. If I tried it again, i'm sure I would pick up on something new that I overlooked, there's so many different things going on in this beer.
Mouthfeel: Light-Moderate carbonation with a full body. Sweet, warm, and slick.
Overall: I enjoyed this beer tremendously, the variety of complex flavors make this a unique and delicious beer. It's got about as much flavor as I would think you could possibly get from a beer with an ABV this high. I've drank 10% stouts (almost half as strong) that have tasted boozier than this beer, and that to me is an amazingly well done job. 1,157 charactersMattyc88, Jan 09, 2014

Pours… what do you think with a name like Black Tuesday? Doesn’t disappoint, either. 
The aroma is just as big, bold, and overpowering. Monster stout plus dark Belgian ale plus barrel aging means there’s a lot to unpack: dark chocolate, coffee, raisins, figs, floral esters, vanilla, leather, and some booze all come to mind. Each sip unravels another element of the same. Lots of heat. Too much, in fact, to bring it together as it warms. At least for this reviewer I found the heat distracting when it should be inviting. Another year or five, however… 631 characterselNopalero, Jan 06, 2014

The body looks almost oily. Dark brown and somewhat thin looking but somehow very oily looking as well. Didn't get much head.
S-A giant whiff of boozy bourbon and all sorts of dark, concentrated maltiness. Loads of fudge and brownie. Some dark fruit and more spicy bourbon and even some vanilla.
T-I really have to applaud this beer for its exceptional integration of alcohol. I was expecting a tongue-sizzling wave of booze but it's surprisingly not nearly as aggressive. The bourbon notes are as powerful as in the nose. The fudge and brownie and other chocolate descriptors all flow across the tongue. Light soy sauce. Vanilla attributed to the bourbon. A big dose of dark fruit as well.
M-Oily, like it looks. Obviously hot. Should be far less drinkable. It's intoxicating in more ways than one. It really wraps you in and begs for more sipping. Super sweet and sticky.
O/D-Lucky to try this one. I enjoyed it but was far less enamored than most. I appreciate Black Tuesday's epic delivery but would not consider it to be anyway near one of the best beers I have had. 1,188 charactersVelvetExtract, Jan 04, 2014

4.51/5  rDev +0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5One of my all-time wants, at last. I'm glad this year's batch wasn't difficult to get as I thought it would be. 2013 vintage. Poured into a snifter from a 750ml bottle on NYE, and for obvious f***ing reasons, split with as many people as possible. Then again, I might have had 6oz of this, when all was said and done.
Pours a viciously opaque beer, with no light going through this thing at all. No much carbonation or head retention, it seems - about a half film of a fizzy tanned head coated the top of the glass. I believe this is bottle conditioned, but it seems to have made little difference in the carbonation (although I have heard of these gushing before), and overall, well, it's extremely syrup like (think more fortified wines and low ABV chocolate liqueurs) and it's definitely quite intense overall. Not pretty, but not the point here.
Quite a monstrous aroma, too - once you get past the slightly stinging boozy sensation from the beer at hand, lots of flavors reveal themselves in a firm, stoic manner. Dark chocolate, roasted, charred wood and grains. Raisins, prunes, and dates. White pepper and lavender, alongside a cornucopia of barrel spices - vanilla, burnt toffee, caramel, cinnamon, cloves, tobacco, and leather. The bourbon these guys are using is of extremely good quality, and it softens up a lot of of what would make this too harsh to drink. At the same time, a lot of the notes from the bourbon - which would normally be overly sweet - add an elegant vibe to the madness by feeling rich and bright, and not over the top or unbalanced. Really good - could strive for more balance, but I suppose that's not the point here.
Holy hell! The flavor and finish kicks most barrel aged stouts out of the park, however. I was simply stunned on how flavorful and complex this is. At first, you are immediately battered with all kinds of sweet and rich notes from the base beer, consisting of roasted chocolate, fudge, and molasses, as well as some rich dried dark fruit notes, ranging from raisins to cherries. Then, when all is said and done, the bourbon starts to work its magic - tons of vanilla, burnt toffee, caramel, cinnamon, and maple syrup, as well as an aftertaste where all of these flavors are fully enhanced and continue to rise in part of the excellent, creamy oaky notes. More nuances make themselves noticeable as this warms - licorice, tobacco, leather, baking soda. 
Unbelievably complex, and a scarily easy beer to drink. While the alcohol was present in the aroma, it's barely noticeable here. You barely feel it, to be honest, and I regretfully drank this much faster than I should have. A little too syrupy overall, and some extra carbonation would really help this thing. Regardless, this is certainly my favorite flavored bourbon stout to date!
Imagine crossing a highly quality RIS, Tawny port, and Kentucky bourbon, and you have Black Tuesday. So many flavors and profiles to pick from, and I'm happy I have two more bottles that I plan on cellaring for a good long while. I'd imagine this would soften up further, and cut the sweetness down in a more elegant manner. Definitely not one that I'd want to have too much at a time, unless it's all I'm drinking that night. While it's not perfect, it tastes pretty amazing. Cheers to the Bruery for this successful experiment! 3,323 charactersmagictacosinus, Jan 02, 2014

overall: I poured this at 50F degrees which was clearly to cold. 55F or 60F is a better starting point. This beer also benefits from oxidation (about 15-30 minutes).  Once at the right temperature  and oxidized the flavors fully come through.
My impression: This is a "best in class" imperial stout. 
Disclaimer: 5 ratings from me do not mean "no room for improvement". I simply do not believe in the concept. 5 rating from me means "best in class"  at the time of the tasting.

Nose- absurdly good. Big bourbon, milk chocolate, sugary sweet molasses, slight oak, slight booze. I could smell this all day long, I wish they made candles with this smell. Really, it's that good. 
Taste- holy shit. Absolutely lives up to the hype. That bruery barrel aged flavor you find in brews like melange 3 and bois is here, big time. Huge bourbon and sweet molasses, slight milky chocolate, a little boozy. Really follows suit with the nose. Perfect mouthfeel. Tastes like 10 or 11%, nowhere near 18.9. Booze is well hidden 
Overall- I'm glad this lived up to the hype for me. Really a great balanced beer, glad I have more 800 charactersVernonBaxter, Dec 27, 2013

Pours a near-black body with a thin mocha head, minimal lacing and retention, unsurprising given the abv.
Smell is of a sweet and roasty malt base with bourbon present and not overpowering. Nice notes of chocolate, vanilla, toffee, caramel, and figs.
Taste is akin to the nose, with a roasty sweet base, medium bitterness, good bourbon flavor, and barrel characters shining through. Alcohol is noticeable but incredibly palatable given the insane abv.
Mouthfeel is thick, smooth, syrupy, sticky, low carbonation, very nice.
Overall, a phenomenal BBA stout worthy of the accolades it receives. 677 charactersMCain04, Dec 14, 2013

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.752013 vintage
Appearance: Pours dark and thick, as an Imperial Stout should, with a small khaki head that collars quickly. Lots of alcohol legs, as expected.
Smell: Vanilla, Caramel, Coconut, maple syrup, Bourbon, tannins from the barrel, dark fruit, fairly strong scent of alcohol(shocker).
Taste: Amazing blend of caramel, vanilla and dark fruit up front with a bit of a Bourbon bite in the middle. The end is sweet malt with some roasty character. Though there is a bit of heat at the end as expected, I wouldn't have guessed the high abv; this definitely drinks smoother than how much booze it contains. It sure does warm you up going down, however, which is where you can tell how strong it is.
Mouthfeel: Viscous, silky and smooth. Can't see how this could improve.
Overall: Drinks very smooth for the abv and has an amazing combo of flavors, blended extremely well. I'd love to try some older vintages, but I don't see anything wrong with drinking this right now. Not a let down at all, must age amazingly. 1,017 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Dec 08, 2013

Mild to moderate bitterness. 
Wow, this beer is not what I expected. Too thin, too sweet, not a whole lot of flavor. Not offensive, just not so great either. At least it was better than chocolate rain. 479 charactersFlorida9, Dec 07, 2013

Mouthfeel is hot with mellow carbonation. Overall, this is a very sweet beer but the astronomical abv is well hidden. 383 charactershomebrew311, Dec 07, 2013

Appearance - Black, with a ruby hue around edges. Little to no head. There is no lacing, rather legs, like wine. It looks intimidating almost. 
Aroma - Raisin, bourbon (vanilla and burnt oak), prunes, and a touch of chocolate. 
Taste - Chocolate, anise, raisin, prune, vanilla, oak, bourbon. The flavors all are there separately, and distinguishable. 
Mouthfeel - Burn! Sweet, smooth burn!
Overall - This guy's HUGE! It's complex as hell, but intriguing all the way through. This was fresh as of a month or so. I think it needs at least a full year or two to mellow and mature. 610 charactersKVNBGRY, Nov 30, 2013

A - Black with a cola halo highlight. Bone-white head settles quickly into a thin rim around the edge of the class. Poor retention and low lace.
S - Booze forward nose; Bourbon soaked brownies, dark chocolate, malted milk balls.
T - Whoa. Thick, melted dark chocolate. Brown breads, caramel, almonds, vanilla, oak. Umami; soy sauce and sweet caramelized carrots. Molasses, brown sugar, and bourbon finish.
M - Incredible finish - possibly the best staying power I've ever had in a beer. Full, smooth, creamy frame.
O - An outstanding stout, absolutely worth the hype. 607 charactersvfgccp, Nov 30, 2013

A: Less black than I'd expected. Coca-cola glints in direct light. No head.
S: Boozy as hell. Bourbon -- sure, sharp, and almost harsh.
T/M: Holy god, this is as good as any beer I've ever tried. Molasses, fudge, caramel, winter berries, bourbon, brown sugar, hint of booze. The mouthfeel is almost a letdown, with prickly alcohol and loads of sugar. Is it too sweet? Maybe. Maybe. But that's poking holes in perfection. Rich, luxuriant, and infinitely rewarding.
O: This is an absolutely incredible beer. Highest recommendation. Is it the absolute best beer ever? Not quite. Maybe close. But not quite. Slightly too sweet and too boozy. 742 charactersAgentMunky, Nov 19, 2013

A: The bottle releases some smoke as it opens. Pours a dark black, not quite opaque, with dark red highlights if held up to a light. There's a little bit of tan head, which mostly disappears except for a very thin rim around the edge of the glass.
S: Extremely dense and sweet, noticeable as soon as the bottle is cracked. Deep notes of anise, cherry, and booze. Kind of like a cocktail, maybe something with good blanco tequila, but with a denser sweetness. So rich, and so good.
T: Dense mid-high sweetness from the start through the finish, with slightly bitter hop notes through the finish and throughout the aftertaste. Very sweet, strong, dense, and enjoyable.
M: Extremely full body, medium to low carbonation.
Overall, wow. Exceptional. Also, dangerously, extremely, and unabashedly strong. I have had maybe a fifth of the bottle and I can feel it, and that is very unusual. You should probably taste this with many people, to keep you from drinking as much of it as you want. Because you will want all of it, and that is not healthy.

4.56/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5my first taste of the legendary Black Tuesday. had to fight the Bruery's server for it, but I finally got me a few bottles to try. very thick and heavy so I have a liter growler of Noble's Big Whig IPA as a chaser!
vigorous pour results in a 1/2 finger of tan foam which subsides quickly. very dark, dark brown color.... all barrel smell after the pour. minimal soapy lace on the sides. very rich aroma of barrel, whiskey, roasted malts.... very nice aroma, though, want to continue wafting it in....
some chocolate here, but mostly the bourbon is what makes its mark. I wonder if it aged a bit if it would mellow any? definitely some strong flavors here with the near 19% abv but these are very nice flavors. vanilla, some dark fruit. very sweet. licorice? it says anise, but I don't get any of that. maybe some brown sugar?
very thick flavor, almost syrup. for the abv, I suppose that is required....
well, I tasted the legendary Black Tuesday. finally. it is what I had expected after tasting some other Bruery labels. sweet, stout, strong. syrup-y. I planned ahead for this, even, by having the chaser ready to go.... it really goes well with all the left over Butterfingers and (especially) Almond Joys left over from Halloween. actually, I stole them from my kids' bags... and as a matter of contention, try a little Tootsie Roll with your Black Tuesday... really brings out the alcohol... and sugar.
all in all, my first sip of this legend, a nice chaser, leftover Halloween candy, and football. what a great sunday! as jimmy buffett says (sings), I wish lunch could last forever... 1,589 characterspkalix, Nov 03, 2013

(2012 vintage) An aggressive pour yielded no head or lacing with a rather flat looking pitch black body. The nose was huge and amazing. Tons of bourbon, oak, and roasty chocolate along with hints of vanilla, booze, espresso, and a touch of black licorice and soy sauce. The taste follows suit with huge notes of dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, and vanilla along with hints of booze soaked black cherries, espresso, molasses, port wine, and leather. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and boozey and hot. There really was very little tangible carbonation. Overall, I've had this at tastings several times, but this was my first actual bottle of it. And although it's bold and full of flavor, it's so hot and boozey that it really detracts from the experience of drinking such a big beer. I drank this over the period of several hours and the booze was just relentless the entire time. I think I'll keep my other two bottles in the cellar for a while and see what happens... 1,014 charactersbeerdrifter, Oct 26, 2013

A: Pours a nicely opaque black, with no visible carbonation and a thin tan head.
S: Big bourbon, oak, cacao, dark fruits, sweet with roasted malts, tannins, and mild acetone.
T: Boozy bourbon, oak, cacao, some dark fruits, sticky sweet, and big alcohol burn with some acetone. Boozy sticky chocolate in the hang.
M: Thin body for a big Imperial Stout, low carbonation, and whatever superlative you'd care to apply to the alcohol presence.
O: First of all, this was good. There's an awful lot of barrel character and booze, to the point that even if the ABV wasn't so high, I wouldn't want to drink it all the time. My biggest complaint was the body. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the amazing mouthfeel of Cigar City's stouts, but this really fell short in that department. Very good, but not quite great. 948 charactersmacrosmatic, Oct 13, 2013

Aroma is huge bourbon, molasses, chocolate, toffee, oak, char, caramel... the list of adjectives goes on and on.
Taste follows nose. Tons of bourbon and dark roasty malt, sticky-sweet chocolate-covered black cherries, caramel, and loads of vanilla. A rich dessert sipper of a beer.
Mouthfeel is sticky and chewy, coating, heavy, decadent.
Overall a big crazy barrel-aged bourbon stout that managed somehow to exceed my expectations. 651 charactersdraheim, Oct 11, 2013

A: as black as the Tuesday it was sold on. Very little head, minimal lacing.
S: espresso, chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla. Bourbon dominates.
T: holy crap! this is the one we came here for and it's delivers. A cascade of dark fruits' featuring dates, raisins and plums. Chocolate and cinnamon do a tarantella with vanilla beans. Is that the 19.2% that's putting me in a trance? I swoon as it warms; the flavors enhance greatly. Let me take a seat. That bourbon-y finish leaves us all in awe of this liquid death.
M: Medium to heavy with chewy carbonation.

Huge gusher, seriously why? Almost 20 % ABV, really weird and really irritating.
A: Black, basically no head. 
S: Huge sticky molasses nose, sweet sugar, alcohol, vanilla, very sweet, very sweet, nice,… 
T: Lots of caramel, vanilla oak, sweet molasses, brown sugar, creamy, very sweet and very simple, no complexity and terribly exiting honestly. Finish is almost pure alcohol in the finish, light bitter herbs, sticky bitter stuff, quite sticky stuff, bit burn, near pure alcohol,… Seriously it is like they made a very simple RIS and poured some vodka in here, really drags this one down for me personally.
B: Flat, oily and sticky whole
It wasn’t a bad beer per se but it fell tremendously short of its reputation. It is very expensive, hard to get & it is nowhere near even my top 100 RIS’s. Simple, ridiculously, boozy, I really, really do not get the appeal of this beer.
Apparently as it turned out this works really well when blended with fruit lambic. 1,090 characters77black_ships, Sep 19, 2013

A - Thick oily black colour with no head.
S - Verty sweet soft aroma with hints of milk chocolate, very pronounced.
T - Red wine flavours up front followed by some hot sweetness. The bourbon flavours are soft but present, the finish is boozy and sweet. 
M - Thick full body. with minimal carbonation.
O - A massive Imperial Stout. everything about this says overload. Not balanced at all, but rather a bomb of a stout. Won't forget this in a hurry. 553 characterseric5bellies, Sep 12, 2013

Again, The Bruery outdoes themselves with another transcendent ale. Beers simply don't get bigger, bolder, more confident or... more ideal!
Its highly viscous pour is the blackest of blacks- its onyx-like sheen makes the beer look every bit as much like an oil slick as it would anything meant to be placed in the mouth. Ominously dark, mysterious and undoubtedly masculine- there's simply something menacing about the beer's appearance. With really no foam, froth, or streaming to mention- the beer's espresso-like character takes hold.
As espresso is where the aromas take off. Deep sweet and smoky roast character is charged with the strongest roasted coffee that's woven together with molasses and maple syrups. Dark chocolate and dried fruit gives the beer a complex wine-like nose. Cherries, grapes, dates, figs and oak peak through the enormity of malt along with hints of coconut, vanilla and caramel as the beer warms.
Heading into taste, the stout's low-lying carbonation allows its massive malt sweetness to latch onto the taste buds and saturate them fully with high espresso roast, black-strap molasses, bittersweet chocolates, walnuts and a savory, smoky sweetness. Port wine and aged sherry release savory and almost salty flavors with a certain "meatiness" that reminds me playfully of teriyaki and soy sauce. Its that sweet and salty interplay that creates such a savory combination that the stout easily replaces dessert as after dinner reward. Its molasses-infused bourbon flavor is well equipped with oak, vanilla, coconut and char as the beer warms.
Incredibly rich and chewy, the beer's viscosity wraps around the tongue like a ribbon of silk- it might as well make love to the mouth. Its heavy coat easily penetrates to soft tissues of the mouth and is slow to release- allowing for a forever linger of sweetness, booze and brownie.
With all the Imperial Stouts on the market, few reach this kind of apex- its every much a digestive liqueur that's as well balanced, complete and robust as any. If stout is the questions, then Black Tuesday wins! 2,156 charactersBEERchitect, Sep 05, 2013

All the aromas of a barrel aged stout I caught creamy coconut, vanilla and creamy milky tones.
Absolutely first class in taste this has all the complexity you want but yet seems so simple. Some candied fruits and sweet honey are enclosed by milk chocolate, caramel and toffee. The taste has an ideal sweetness level as it doesn't overwhelm but satisfies completely.
This is 19.2 pct ABV, and apparently that's not a typo. Holy Crap! I would never have guessed as there's no alcohol bite or boozy flavor. All I feel is a rich, smooth and full flavored beer. 656 charactersKYGunner, Sep 05, 2013

A: Is not an incredibly dark beer - murky brown/ruby red tinges along the sides of the glass. Sits pitch black in the glass. No head to speak of at all.
S: Amazing! Incredibly balanced and not very boozy at all, really. Sweet vanilla, coconut, and bourbon caramel. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, some booze soaked fruits - plums and cherries. Some oak is present as well. There is a distinctive spiciness - cinnamon and gingerbread. Just a very inviting, strongly aromatic, brilliantly balanced.
-note: I'd give this a 5 but I want to see what CR brings to the table
T: Very sweet but balanced. The sweetness counters the alcohol so well. Rich chocolate, tons of sweet vanilla/coconut/oak, some booze soaked dark fruits, cherry juice, and some coffee at the finish. The spiciness from the aroma comes in at the finish as well.
P: Full, but not very viscous. Very smooth. There is a pop of carbonation that subsides with some swirling. 
O: An astounding malt beverage. The impeccable balance and complexity makes for an exceedingly enjoyable drinking experience. 1,085 characterstimc100, Aug 26, 2013

4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Tommy for nailing this long time want of mine - it has eluded me for too long! Black Tuesday pours, well... black. Deep black with dark, dark brown only rounding out the corners. No head, no foamy collar, nothing in terms of life except for a few bleak bubbles that rise to the surface and immediately pop; its got legs like a supermodel when you swirl the glass, though.
What a massive aroma; as soon as your nose heads towards the glass, Black Tuesday's aroma reaches out and runs a train on your nostrils. Warm bourbon, smooth caramel, cocoa dust, chocolate malts, mild vanilla, thick brown sugar, molasses, and some heavy back-end black licorice and anise. Pretty sweet and boozy, and at 19.2% ABV, I don't think that's a surprise to anyone.
The taste is every bit as huge as the aroma, and every bit of that 19.2% ABV is felt, as well as matched with enormous malty sweetness. Sugary and sweet up front, rivers of warm caramel, bourbon soaked oak chips, roasty chocolate malts, minimal roast, and sticky molasses. It's just such a gigantic beer; every single sip lingers on your palate long after it has been swallowed. Black Tuesday, straight annihilating your taste buds.
Everything you thought you knew about hot, sweet beer just got wrecked thanks to this malt dragon. The finish is full of more cocoa, caramel, bourbon, oak, as well as some vanilla and licorice sweetness. Warmth, of course, brings out more sweetness, more robustness, and more booze. The mouth feel is monstrous as well; sticky and thick, chewy, oily, large and in charge.
Black Tuesday is a beast of a beer - a true night cap and a sipper if there ever was one. It'll take even the manliest of men a while to pounce through their pours of this one. That said, it's quite tasty and really an enjoyable experience, but you better leave the Motrin on the night stand if you plan on tackling this one alone. Huge, sweet, and boozy; unabashedly so. Thanks again, Tommy. 1,961 characterstectactoe, Jul 29, 2013

A: Dark brown edges with a black body; no head.
S: Oaky vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar and toasted caramel dominate, as expected; everyone who has had this beer and its variants must know what I'm talking about. Huge sugary-sweet stout with overwhelming caramel, vanilla and brown sugar notes, and just enough roast and dark chocolate to keep it interesting. Lots of hot, boozy bourbon here as well, though for near 20% this is a pretty manageable nose.
T: Bourbon and brown sugar, plenty of caramel as well as vanilla & bourbon...milk chocolate, burnt sugar, boozy & oaky vanilla.
MF: Fuller bodied & hot, low carbonation; very oily and mouth-coating.
O: Awesome beer, very extreme but well-executed. A sipper for sure. 842 charactersScotchboy, Jul 22, 2013

A-Pours a deep dark black with a frothy tan head that has some nice legs.
S-Bourbon and lots of it. Hot, boozy and sweet. This must be a big barrel aged stout. 
T-Really tasty, boozy, toasted marshmallow, brown sugar. Very, very hot on the tongue but nicely flavorful. 
M-Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. 
O-I like this one. Really big ABV. Got to be 12%+. Definitely bourbon barrel aged. Cap says Bruery so I want to guess Black Tuesday, though the unopened one I have is waxed, first bottling.

Been sitting in the "cellar" for a few months and decided it's the 4th of July weekend and no reason to keep cellaring a beer I have not had. Thanks to beerinNV for the chance to try this!
Pouring out of the bottle not nearly as black as I expected. Nearly zero head. Big alcohol legs. Almost more of a deep chestnut brown that black.
Smells like caramel and bourbon most predominantly. Then appealing burnt sugars. Finally a slight alcohol burn in the nostrils. 
Taste follows the nose for the most part. Big, nearly diabetic sweetness -- and I don't mean that negatively. It really works with the beer. Bourbon and barrel notes. Also caramelized malts. Slight alcohol sting on the finish.
As would be expected, low carb but actually a almost surprisingly light mouth feel. It does finish sticky and sweet.
No doubt this beer is an accomplishment. The booze is extremely well integrated. It's there for sure but less hot than beers that are 5 or 6 percent less booze. An experience worth having. 1,045 charactersPowderhornphil, Jul 04, 2013

2012 Vintage
A - Pours a deep brown/black with a few dark tan bubbles that form, move to the edges and then fade away quickly.
S - Bourbon, alcohol heat, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts.
T - Bourbon and lots of heat, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts. Very good.
D - Heavy body with lower carbonation.
O - This is a great beer that I have just never gotten around to opening. It was a nice bbq with friends over, so we opened some good beers. This was one of the hilights for me. Lots of boozy bourbon, heat, and layers of chocolate and vanilla. Wonderful beer. 604 charactersHuskyinPDX, Jun 30, 2013

A - Black Tuesday pours that heady black sexy you anticipated, with a decent deep mocha head that makes you drool ever-so-slightly.
S - Smell-wise, I get booze-soaked chocolate coconut cookie...wait, someone make that in food form, I need to get my Wilfred Brimley on. But yeah, booze, sugars, a pinch of coffee, bourbon deliciousness.
T - So, there's actually a healthy amount of diversity going on here. Beyond that bourbon carry-over from the shnozz, the myriad of heady sweetness is outstanding: chocolate, vanilla, coconut, toffee, chocolate-cherry, butter, and vanilla-cocoa...I dunno...it's the tits.
M - I honestly think this tastes no where near 19.2...I mean, I dig the heat components, and it's certainly sweet, but it's also incredibly drinkable for all that's going on here; it's a bit 'coating' and most definitely a sipper. It's also delicious and way too easy to drink. 
O - I can't say I was let down here in any capacity. In fact, this beer exceeded my expectations. It betters as it warms a bit, with sweet, potent complexity assuming the best of everything within this bottle with a coat of beer-sexy on your tongue. Giddy-up. 1,192 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Jun 22, 2013

4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle from 2012, about 6oz poured into a snifter at Dustin's birthday tasting yesterday, 6.15.2013.
Aroma: Lots of bourbon and heat, which dominates the nose. But there are marshmallows and tons of chocolate, very sweet. It basically smelled like bourbon smores. Interesting! I thought the heat was really off-putting, but altogether this beer has a really, sweet and complex nose.
Colour: Pitch black, like a black hole. Not much of a head at all, which is not surprising for a high gravity beer like this. There isn't even a collar, and there isn't any lacing at all when I swirl it around. Its black, that's all I can expect from a beer called Black Tuesday.
Flavour: Really, really sweet. Like mentioned before, it tastes like a crap ton of chocolate, bourbon and a little vanilla sweetness. There's a lot going on here, but the best way to put it is hot, hot bourbon smores. It all comes together well, not all that cloying. Deliciously bourbony and malty!
Mouthfeel: Thinner bodied but full of flavour. Actually quite well carbonated for a giant stout like this. Aftertaste is mostly all the malty sweetness that I experienced while swishing this beer along my palate. Its pretty much dessert. Really, the biggest problem with this beer is that it's so damn boozy. I know its a 19.2% beer, but it was just a beer that took a long time to finish. Still, so black and thick... gotta say this is a hell of a mouthfeel.
Overall: Delicious. It's like drinking bourbon and port together. Thick thick beer that is very sweet but not cloyingly so. As mentioned above, the problem is that its got too much alcohol in it- I can smell it in the nose immediately as its being poured, and it definitely gets hotter as it gets warmer. I think its a deliciously sweet barrel-aged big stout but for the $36 it costs per bottle, I'll take 6 bottles of BCBS. It's not a very good value IMO (which does not detract from the overall scoring in this review), but I'm glad to have at least tried it. 1,995 charactersStevedore, Jun 16, 2013

Smell: Bourbon and chocolate, with undertones of vanilla and marshmallow; boozy heat
Taste: Chocolate, up front, with the Bourbon, vanilla, marshmallow and coconut building in the middle; quite boozy, after the swallow, with dark fruit, coffee and maple flavors that linger in the finish; the aftertaste has some sweet cherry tones, as well
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low carbonation; tons of heat
Overall: I had this once before and remember it as being way to big and boozy so I was surprised to find that the 2012 bottling (with the benefit of of some time in the cellar) was really quite flavorful and complex without overwhelming the palate

Smell: Initial smell is of booze and intense sweetness. Some barrel is in there too. Not getting much else.
Taste: Intense milk chocolate sweetness up front, very cloying. A bit of barrel shows. Rest of the back end is mostly pure rubbing alcohol. Finish is cloying and messy.
Mouthfeel/Overall: Very thick on the palate initially with appropriate carbonation. Again, finish is super hot and messy which retracts. Overall, I did not like this beer and won't seek it out. All hype. Super boozy and sweet with no balance. 723 characterszhanson88, Jun 06, 2013

I get a ton of nice roasted chocolate malt, cocoa nibs, light vanilla and bourbon. some char and some sweeter milk chocolate too. its complex and huge, but it isn't overpowering or out of balance. now the taste? that is overpowering! wow! what an explosion of flavors here, everything I could smell just cascades over my whole palate. chocolate is large, vanilla is bigger too than it smells, its almost like the best ice cream ever, and its got me thinking about a float... is that sacrilege or is it encouraged? the weight of this beer and its alcoholic strength are not immediately apparent. im lost in a chocolate covered oak orgasm here, its maxed out. the feel again impresses me, that its still beer like at this size. decent carbonation and a full body, but again, it isn't syrupy or overly sticky thick as to be undrinkable. obviously a bottle to share, but wow, this is incredible. id say this is a special occasion beer, but its somehow even too good for Christmas, if that makes sense. its more like just pop it on a random Wednesday and see what happens. again, drlovemd87 is a legend for making this possible. I wont soon forget black Tuesday, and I am really curious for its other incarnations.
edit: drank a fresh one last night as a midnight toast for the new year. i have to say, i was surprised that this wasnt alcoholically hot. the year on the one reviewed here i thought had done much of the mellowing, but its mellow as its made. i have even more admiration for this beer now, really really special stuff. 2,217 charactersStonedTrippin, May 31, 2013

4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.752012 vintage (19.2%) served into a snifter.
Aroma – I pick up massive bourbon and alcohol. I'm having trouble picking up much else. If I closed my eyes, I'd swear it was an actual glass of bourbon I smell.
Appearance – A quickly dissipating head, opaque, a bit murky. This beer is actually leaving fingers on the sides of my glass.
Mouth feel – full, but not as thick as I was expecting, medium carbonation, coating the inside of my mouth, warming as I swallow. I think my tongue is a bit numb like it is being anesthetized.
Taste – I pick up "the usual suspects" for an imperial stout – dark fruits (plum, cherry, raspberry), vanilla, cocoa, fudge, caramel. Aspects of the taste reminded me of the goo you get from the inside of a chocolate covered cherry. There is also wonderful bourbon / oak flavors along with a touch of leather (in a non-sexual way). I pick up some hops, but the beer finishes with a candy sweet aftertaste. 
Overall – there are controversies about this type of imperial stout, but I absolutely loved it. I split this bottle with my wife and we took approximately 90 minutes to finish it. The experience was worth every minute of that 90. We drank a toast to Kevo2007 (the wonderful BA who sent me this bottle), the FedEx driver who delivered the package, the brewer at The Bruery who created this beer, and everyone else in between. 1,373 charactersbeefmental, May 20, 2013

750ml bottle, 2012, served in a snifter.
A: black and thick. Not super thick or syrupy. 
S: bourbon, burnt sugar, chocolate. 
T: bourbon/booze but not overbearing for 19%. Burnt sugar coated raisins (light raisin taste) mix with chocolate and a dash of vanilla.
M: not super thick, but definitely sticks a bit. Feels a bit hot, and should be sipped. Swig at your own discretion.
O: I'll be honest, initially I was thinking not the best. About 2 sips later it improved. The further I got into this baby, the more I appreciated it. For a super boozy beer, this is top notch. You will definitely notice/taste/smell the booze, but for 19% or so, I think it blends VERY well. The more I think on this beer, and miss the flavor, the more I admire it. Definitely share a bottle with 2-3 others (even if I did not do the same...yikes). 890 characterschrisp450, May 19, 2013

Bourbon nose.
Again, bourbon is not shy. Rich chocolate, more akin to milk than dark, pervades. There's some vanilla, which is really just bourbon, but it's not at all a complex beer but wonderfully potent with a very welcome alcohol bite instead of burn. A dessert that tastes like night.
It is smooth, carbonation's light as expected. 398 characterspants678, May 14, 2013

Now relax, my children; it ain't all unicorns and rainbows like a sorority girl's brain waves; it's a bit boozy on the tongue and nose, and when Raul says a "bit," he means, a sand speckle "bit." 
All in all, Raul does it, Raul does it good. Still, it's kind of a one and done sort of thang (like Raul's Gucci wearing princess in high school). But like said hoochie, Raul knows that he will have dreams of coming back. 716 charactersRaulMondesi, May 02, 2013

Appearance. Pours a deep dark brown, almost black in the glass but not quite. There's a collar of khaki head, but that's about it. Looks pretty ominous.
Smell. Chocolate liquer, some coffee and oaky vanilla. There's a little sweet coconut there as well. Lots and lots of booze.
Taste. Nice bourbon and sweet chocolate, some coconut and vanilla with a good amount of fresh and clean oak barrel. Insanely high alcohol is dangerously well hidden.
Mouthfeel. Full body and warm, but not very sticky considering the substantial sweetness. 
Overall. Fantastic stuff. It's a sipper for sure, but amazingly drinkable for the crazy abv. Tackling this one solo, wish me luck! 857 charactersRutager, Apr 29, 2013

Pours a deep dark black and starts to look slightly brown as it reaches the top of the glass. Little to no head. Not quite as thick and viscous as I imagined.
Aroma is nice - strong bourbon, bakers chocolate, vanilla beans, deep roasted malts and a big alcohol note.
This beer is so sweet, brunt sugar, rich chocolate and booze. The beer is incredibly boozy and hot, you can taste the bourbon and a bit of oak on the finish.
Mouthfeel is creamy and pretty nice. Overall it was good but not amazing. Way to sweet for me. Got down about 8 oz, which was just enough. 576 characterschefjack428, Apr 22, 2013

Smell was pretty inviting. Lots of booze, but balanced out by tons and tons of dark fruits and chocolate.
Taste, alas was just a bit too intensely overwhelming for me. It's obvious from the smell that you are about to catch a beatdown, but the bourbon is just ferocious. Don't get me wrong, I like bourbon well enough, but this is far and away the most aggressively barrel-forward beer I have ever tried. I split this bottle four ways, and the one guy who really liked bourbon thought it was awesome, the rest of us agreed that this is one that should probably be laid down for a long time. The heat was also very formidable, as you would expect from such a huge beer. There is plenty going on here, but my brain was just screaming "BOURBON" and "HEAT".
The mouthfeel was full-bodied, sweet and sticky, appropriate for the style.
Overall, this one was ok, but just a little over the top for me. Perhaps being consumed at the end of a long, intense stout season had a lot to do with it..I will let the other bottle I have sit until the fall and revisit hopefully a little more mellowed out version, and with a renewed desire for big, barrel-aged stouts after a summer of sours and IPA's. 1,334 charactersIrishize75, Apr 21, 2013

A: Surprised by the head on this given the amount of booze. Pitch black pour, extremely thick and a small tan head. 
S: First thing I noticed was booze. Booze soaked dark fruits. Followed by lots of caramel malts, dark chocolate, bourbon and oak. This thing smells great. 
T: Very well balanced bourbon flavor. Not hot at all. Lots of dark fruits and chocolate fudge. Lots of chocolatey goodness, along with some brown sugar, caramel and a tiny bit of vanilla. A bit of maple in the back as well. I was afraid this would be too sweet. It is very sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Tastes boozy, almost a bit like Utopia or wine. The dark fruits definitely give it a bit of a vinous character. 
M: Full bodied with little carbonation. Sticky, thick and sweet. Surprisingly it was very smooth. 
O: Absolutely massive sipping beer. Split between two of us and we finished it in a bit over 2 hours. Very nice boozy flavors as it warmed up. Great stuff, I will be on the lookout for more. Can't wait to open the Chocolate Rain and Grey Monday and make some comparisons. 1,095 charactersstandardcherry, Apr 17, 2013

Weren't sure what to expect when we cracked this, after a few whiffs and a couple of sips, cracked the benchmark by which I compare all BA Stouts to - BCBS. While the BCBS (2012) got the BT today in smoothness, drinkability, overall experience, the BT was damn good, albeit, HOT! I would go as far as to say, as big as it is today, it may have more potential than BCBS in the future. The BCBS is just so damn good right now. Glad we have a few bottles of the BT to age, look forward to revisiting in 12-18 months. We should have sat on this one longer, but glad we tried it. 635 charactersWardo, Apr 05, 2013

A thick black viscous liquid coats the inside of my glass with great legs. Aromas of chocolate, brown sugar, caramel, molasses, raisins and other dark dried fruits, along with a fair amount of ethanol. The flavor is sweet with dark and burnt sugars but that is countered nicely with a present but not overpowering alcohol heat. Roast and chocolate molasses round out the flavor nicely. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy mouthfeel. This is a monster of a beer, but its frikin tasty and devilishly deceptive. 630 charactersjohnnnniee, Mar 24, 2013

4.04/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75A - I am actually quite impressed for the ABV that this holds some carbonation, even though short lived resulting in just a mild lace ring I got a 1/8 inch of mocha head. Again I am surprised its not pitch black as it has some ruby hues to that base of the darkness.
S - Smell is very inviting of black currant, some port wine, and a heavy dose of bourbon. I can pick up mild notes of cocoa and dark fruits but it's faint.
T - WARNING the 2012 batch is boozy as hell. Even when warmed the bourbon notes smack you in the face then sweeten the tongue with one of the most heavy doses of caramel I ever tasted. When I get past the booze (very hard to do) It has an almost marshmallow like candy sweetness (and I love sweet beers) with what can only be described by me is a lashing of sugar plums and licorice. Very little chocolate (I could see why they made a version with cocoa nibs) or roast. As others described it's like a wine and I guess I was born to hate it since I can't stand wine. 
M - Heavy if you swish this in your mouth prepare to gag a little bit as the bourbon is one of the most strongest I have ever encountered. As it warms to a near room temperature (55-60 degree's) it's almost unbearable of the level of bourbon. 
Overall I shared this with my brother and even though he is not a craft beer drinker he helped me with 8oz of this. As I type I still have 2oz (of my 16) and it's so hard to choke down. I guess it's true that some people rate things higher when they pay the "rare" cost. 1,506 charactersDrDemento456, Mar 18, 2013

M: medium-full body and tingling/numbing booze. Enjoyable to sip on...only to sip on.
O: This is a beer I've always wanted to try, and it almost lived up to the hype but not quite.

Pours a sludgey cola brown color, almost jet black but lots of brown hues are visible when struck by the light. A few tiny bubbles appear momentarily but are gone immediately and no lacing is left behind. The aroma is powerfully sweet, lots of chocolate, bourbon, sweet oak, mollasses, vanilla, brown sugar and even some toasted marshmallow at the end. There is a powerful alcohol presence that lingers and almost burns the nose, not to be unexpected at nearly 20%, but still a bit of a deterrent. The flavors are really intense, lots of bourbon and sweet milk chocolate, brown sugar, a bit of bitter roast and molasses, chewy oak is a nice touch with some vanilla behind it but the alcohol really dominates the back end of this and the finish is fairly hot. The body is nice, chewy at times, silky at others, it coats the mouth well, nearly zero carbonation but just enough to keep it lively and interesting and there is a nice warming sensation as it goes down.
Verdict: Despite this beer being nearly 20% and fairly hot, it's very drinkable which is quite impressive, but I'm not blown away by this. I've been fortunate enough to try a variety of vintages of this and even with time it's still a alcohol forward beer which isn't really my preference. A worthy beer for anyone who enjoys a barrel aged stout, but there are plenty of better ones on the market, and many of them for a better price. 1,524 characterskevanb, Mar 15, 2013

Appearance and mouthfeel are both good, but the smell and taste are darn right awesome. Lots of flavors come through as it warms.. chocolate, molasses, fig, burnt sugar, bourbon, and a touch of vanilla. Delicious! Worth seeking out if you can. 340 charactersalysmith4, Mar 13, 2013

Surprisingly not as dark as thought it would be. A good brown mahogonay coming out of the bottle hits with a solid dark walnut body. Very opaque and har to see through.
Nose has a huge chunk of molasses and sticky quality. Lots of sticky toffee. Thick smelling. Good sense of controlled whiskey like heat, with complimenting red fruits of cherry and raspberry. Great smelling beer, luckily not too hot on the nose.
Palate hits with a good chunk of sweet taffy. Lots of sticky peppermint and warming menthol finish. Controlled warmth with a nice warming big hit in the pit of your stomach. Lots of chocolate sensations with a thick almost syrup like body. Fruit action comes after repeated sips and some warmth, hinting of thick red fruits of cherry/raspberry feeling. Much of the molasses seem to get left behind.
Overall the flavors are nicely balanced, and even at this high abv it's still incredibly easy to drink. Very memorable beer and quite enjoyable, very well made. 1,081 characterssmakawhat, Mar 10, 2013

A: I was concerned after opening because I had a slow eruption. Thankfully nothing bad was happening. Pitch black with a reasonable head for a beer of this age and abv. Left quick but came back with a swirl. Huge cling of course, like oil.
S: Chocolate cake, brown sugar, booze
T: Heavy dose of rich milk chocolate, marshmallow, fig, butterscotch, caramel covered by overtones of bourbon - or at least the impression of it due to the booze factor. Thankfully I don't really get that anise/licorice flavor often present in these beasts.
F: Carbonation is spot on to cut through the oily thickness, not too prickly but more silky. It doesn't come across as being too heavy or slick somehow, which it seemed to when fresh. Still burns a little though.
O: I had this fresh back in December 2012, and found it enjoyable but overwhelming and very hot/boozy, and al out cloyingly slick and sweet. Four years have done wonders on this one! While it is still boozy, it has really mellowed out to what I would expect from a 12-14% aged stout, which is a huge positive. It landed in the "spot on" category for me, exactly what I would have wanted from a beer of this nature.
Would love to drink again or try variants, preferably aged. 1,300 charactersdoucmehu, Mar 01, 2013

A: Pours black, with brown hues on the edges. There is a think bubbly khaki colored head that fades quickly, leaving a small frothy ring along the edges of the beer. There is no lacing as it drinks.
S: The nose is really sweet. I get prunes, raisins, dates, some caramel, and maybe a bit of vanilla extract.
T: It starts out with a big burst of sugary sweetness. I get prunes, caramel, and vanilla extract, and white chocolate. The beer get's hugely boozy in the back end, but you kind of expect that with a 19.2% beer.
M: Full bodied beer. Sweet and smooth to start, but once the liquid moves off the palate, it gets sticky and almost syrupy.
O: This is a good beer. I don't know if I'd call it great, but I'm enjoying it. It's very sweet, and that is usually a turn off for me, but the alcohol is so high that it cuts the sweetness a bit. It's going to be a chore to finish this bottle by myself. Challenge accepted! 976 characterstrxxpaxxs, Mar 01, 2013

A - Dark chocolate brown with a slight mocha colored head on the sides of the glass. Looks to be a really thick and viscous beer
S - Dark chocolate, vanilla, slight bourbon and oak
T - Sweet vanilla, light chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit (like plums) and light oak that lingers in the finish. This wasn't as boozy as the variants and didn't have as much of a bourbon presence
M - Thick syrupy sweet beer that coats the tongue. Light oak astringency that lingers in the finish.
O - This is one thick and syrupy beer. It is solid across the board. It is definitely a sweet beer with lots of chocolate and vanilla. We had the 09-12 and I'd say this is one beer that is definitely better with about 2 years on it. It helps mellow it out and allows the flavors to blend together well 847 charactersjeonseh, Feb 23, 2013

4.86/5  rDev +8.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I had the 2010 Black Tuesday so it had been aged about 2 1/2 years.
The strongest taste I got was primarily caramel, but I was also able to taste chocolate, cherries, plum, rye, smoke, cream, and a very VERY subtle hint of copper.
The look wasn't all too appealing, mostly because of the lack of head, which I know should be expected anyways, but just didn't help the look at all. The lacing also wasn't as thick as I would've preferred.
Smell was excellent.
In total, nearly a perfect score for me. 503 charactersTherisse, Feb 23, 2013

All I can say is how much hedonism can you fit into a bottle? At least that's what my notes said. Big chocolate syrup notes, dark fruit, coffee and unsweetened cocoa powder. The mouthfeel is silky and immense, It was almost hard to drink between the three of us, at least it would have been if it wasn't so delicious. That being said, this beer is probably the most extreme examples of a stout there can be, and definitely worth picking up and sharing with some good friends. 541 charactersOldPenguinHunter, Feb 07, 2013

M: Right amount of carbonation, smooth and creamy.
O: While I was tasting this I had a buddy say, "If you drank this whole beer, I think it would kill you". That pretty much sums it up. An explosion of flavor and alcohol going on. This beer did not disappoint and I can not wait to acquire some more. 700 charactersRinkor16, Dec 29, 2012

A- Pours squid ink black with just a thin whisp of a tan head that fades immediately into the dark abyss that is this beer. No lacing at all but it is an 18.3% RIS so that wasn't really expected anyway. Really ridiculous oily legs when swirled around the glass! Drips like syrup on a cold day.
S- Vanilla beans, bourbon, charred oak, dried mission figs, black raisins, dried cherries, dark belgian cocoa, and alcohol!!! Little hints of extra bitter espresso on the back end finish. 
T- Tastes just like the smell. Vanilla, figs, dried cherries, dark chocolate and bourbon. The alcohol although present, blends in seemlessly with the dark fruit, caramel, marshmallow and fudge. 
M- Thick as an oil slick! Completely coats your tongue. Love the bourbon, vanilla, chocolate covered marshmallow and toffee. Probably the thickest RIS I've ever had. 
O- Thick, chewy, sweet, and full of flavor. This is exactally what I knew it would be, and what I was hoping for. Alcohol/Bourbon is everpresent, but it highlights all the other flavors, bringing them together in perfect harmony. Damn close to a perfect RIS! 1,119 charactersThickfreakness, Dec 26, 2012

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52012 vintage. Reviewed on 11/23/2012. 750ml bottle poured into a snifter.
Despite the name the beer pours a deep brown color. It looks closer to black once it settles in the glass but it's still not quite there. Surprisingly, given the ABV, a slight head develops leaves a bit of lacing. Nothing remarkable in general but decent for an 18.2% ABV beer.
The nose is huge here. At first the bourbon comes across and makes it seem extremely boozy, which it is, but once you get past that some nice aromas really open up. There is a great vanilla note that seems to be present throughout. There is some nice dark fruit that peeks its head out. Very raisin-like. There is a bit of some wood as well. Really nice oak character that opens up as the beer warms.
The taste actually seems less boozy than the nose but there is a lot more that comes through. There is still a huge bourbon note but it blends extremely nicely with some vanilla, toffee and oak, some dark fruit, think raisin again, and bit of some chocolate. Aside from the bit of chocolate the rest of the flavors seem to be here in equal parts. Really impressive. 
The mouthfeel is huge, as expected. Each sip coats the mouth and sends a slight burn down the throat. That being said, it is also incredibly smooth. The carbonation is low and it is somewhat sticky. 
This beer definitely lived up to the hype. It's pretty amazing that a beer this big can feel as smooth and drinkable as it does. 1,453 charactersms11781, Dec 23, 2012

3.68/5  rDev -17.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I have had the privilege of trying this brew each year it was released but never got around to writing a formal review. This time I am making it happen with a fresh 2012 bottle into a matching Bruery snifter. The brew pours brown in color as it streams out of the bottle and collects in my glass as a darker fudgy brown color. About a finger of khaki head sits atop and fades to a thin film across the top with less than a half finger holding around the outside perimeter of the glass. Rising bubbles maintain that partial forth around the edge of the glass seemingly throughout the entire duration. When held to the light, the brew shows some lighter brown coloration around the edges with hints of red.
The aroma of this brew is sweet with suggestions of vanilla and chocolate. There are plenty of dark fruity alcohol esters present in the nose mixing with a significant supporting role of whiskey. The residual sweetness of the nose is reminiscent of belgian candy sugar coupled with vinous notes. As the brew warms up, some herbal hop notes come forward. When swirled and as the brew warms, there are very minor roasty elements.
The initial flavors are quite sweet but there is a significant amount of booze also present that is borderline numbing to the tongue. A lot of dark fruity alcohol mingles on the tongue creating flavors akin to raisins, plumes, prunes and molasses with again, a kick of solvent alcohol. When bigger sips are taken, there is a bit of an herbal hop present and dry oak quality. As it warms up, it gets somewhat medicinal with a greater focus on whiskey aspects instead of beer.
This is a full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It has a huge alcohol impact that really suppresses the overall drinkability. There is quite a bit of complexity here to take in and I gotta say this one has me scratching my head. I dont want to be "that guy" who proclaims the Bruery and this beer has changed but quite frankly, this is not the same beer I remember enjoying in years past. I realize the recipe isn't the same each year and the alcohol varies but this is a significant variance from years past. This is more like a fruity/vinous dark belgian strong ale than the thick and syrupy chocolate smoothie of a beast stout I remember. 2,268 charactersstakem, Dec 23, 2012

A: I'm a little surprised on the carbonation on this, pretty bubbly. Pours pitch black, with a half inch mocha colored head. Turned into a small ring of bubbles with a bunch of alcohol sticking to the glass. 
S: A bold and powerful smelling brew. Bourbon with chocolate, sweet roasted malts and booze.
T: Rich chocolate and bourbon blends with oak, vanilla, roasty malts, a bit of dark fruits and caramel sugar. Rum like alcohol flavor is very present, not drinking like almost 20% but hot, none the less. 
M; This is an out there American style beer, not surprised about the hype on this stuff. Strong and incredibly sweet and flavorful. At 19% alcohol this is a dessert brew thats for sipping only.
O: It reminds me of an all malt mixed drink, and I can't really drink more than 6oz. Really awesome though, just something I'd keep in the cellar for 5 years to a decade and drink occasionally with a crew of homies.
It's not my favorite ba imperial stout, I prefer Hunahpu, bcbs and bcbcs and a couple of others just mainly because of mouthfeel and drinkability. This is a great beer though that pushes the limits of brewing. glad I finally got to try this. 1,257 charactersGoogs, Dec 15, 2012

#33
Bottled Date: 2012 Vintage
A: Poured into a oversized wine glass boasting a jet black body with a light brown head that quickly settles down.
S: Strong bourbon alcohol vapors intertwined with licorice, chocolate, espresso, marshmallows, brown sugar, fig and dark fruit. 
T: The bourbon is the backbone of this brew which has components of woodiness building through the palate ending in a warm alcohol finish. Built on the bourbon are notes of smoke, espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla, and marshmallow which bring to mind scenes of sitting by a fire with a cup of mocha making s'mores. Running parallel with the bourbon are dark bread and brown sugar maltiness. On top of this there are some dark fruit characteristics: prunes, figs, and raisins. 
M: Full bodied, smooth, with some chewiness and carbonation which keeps the feel interesting.
O: The new online allocation system allowed me to grab two bottles of this difficult to obtain brew. An Imperial Stout with an amazing 19.2 ABV. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming dressed with a melange of flavors which makes this an amazing beer to experience. A holiday beer that I am thankful to experience this holiday season. 1,216 charactersElSid, Dec 11, 2012

Note: 2011 vintage
Appearance: Dark, dark brown - not exactly black, but very dark, approaching black - light tan head, impressive amount of carbonation given the barrel aging
Smell: Ow, my brains - tons and tons of bourbon aroma - vanilla and some wood - loads of booze, but not as bursting with ethanol as it could be, I suppose - sweet chocolate, loads of caramel, molasses, and a sack of sugar - some dark fruits - absurdly sweet, flirting with the "do not want" line
Taste: A sweet, sugary, bizarre potion - all kinds of sweet, including caramel, burnt caramel, molasses, brown sugar, white sugar, malt extract - sweet chocolate, like a chocolate hard candy - sweet vanilla - intense bourbon flavor - thankfully, light on the wood and dry alcohol - mild burnt bitterness - dark, cooked fruits - very sweet - absolutely disgusting if consumed with a gulp, but tasty if sipped, hard to give an actual score
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, syrupy, oily, with a legitimate alcohol burn, not a huge fan
Overall: Black Tuesday? More than one of these, and it's more like Blackout Tuesday (omg lol)
This is a syrupy, absurd creation. The level of crazy here is hard to assess. It's somewhere between genuinely disgusting and uniquely charming. I'm very happy that I had a chance to sit down with a full glass of this. It's really not suitable for a small pour at a beer fest. I'll be skipping it at future Extreme Beer Fests. 1,482 charactersangrybabboon, Dec 09, 2012
3.81/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to Steve_0 for the hookup. 2011 vintage. Split with angrybabboon.
Appearance: Pours nearly pitch black with a tiny collar the color of espresso crema. Some deep dark brown and reds when held to direct light, but it's pretty minimal. More carbonation than expected, but that's not a bad thing. Syrupy and full on the pour.
Smell: Alcohol. Pure high alcohol coupled with a large amount of bourbon. Sweet, super sweet malts. Char, leather, dark fruit (cherry, fig, plum), it's all there. Vanilla, big hits of oak. Raisins. Boourbon soaked chocolate covered fruit. Molasses and brown sugar. Some hints of sherry and deeper vinous characteristics. Super sweet and boozy.
Taste: Crazy sweet. Sugar and bourbon. I took a shot of bourbon with a cane sugar rim. Some burnt, deeply roasted malts form a big backbone. Loads of brown sugar, vanilla (as in pure vanilla extract - concentrated). Warm leather. Soy sauce. Caramel. Touches of dark chocolate bitterness layered through the back. Bourbon drops a nice oak note. So much sweetness. It's almost cloying as the beer warms. Bourbon soaked raisins, like legit. Sherry, oxidized in a good way. 
Mouthfeel: Body is medium-full, pushing closer to full. Negligible carbonation. A bit dry overall. Feels hot and drinks like port.
Overall: This couldn't cause The Great Depression, but it's a reasonable recreation of the Boston Molasses Disaster...if you made molasses out of bourbon.
This beer is big, sweet, and massive. This would be an amazing beer to split with 10 people. It's a solid take on a dessert beer/beer for people that don't like beer. It's a liqueur made of bourbon soaked dark fruit. It loses some points in the long run because anything outside of a 3oz pour is difficult to finish. So heavy and sweet and heavy on the bourbon it's hard to really find the depth. 1,832 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Dec 09, 2012

2011 vintage:
Not as 'black' as the name might suggest... edges of cola brown clarity, a full finger of khaki tan head fades quickly to a stubborn ring and spotty islands of carb across the center of the glass, thick oily booze legs dominate the lacing.
Loads of rum raisin and tasteful sweet bourbon, dense caramel qualities, smooth charred oak notes play against the different booze notes, vanilla and toffee, faint milk chocolate with figs or dates... it's all over the place. Smells fantastic.
Wow. Sweet syrupy booze that doesn't burn, chocolate sauce, brown sugar, tons of molasses, bold but well integrated barrel notes, figs, quite sweet... one big ass beer, that's for sure. The bourbon character blossoms a bit more as the beer warms. Surprisingly approachable for such a massive beer. A bit cloying but with the lack of boozy burn I expected, I'm fine with that. Definitely a beer that you have to be in the mood for... it's big, it's sweet, it's strong as hell. Thumbs up.
Great, great beer. I wish I had another to play with in the cellar. 1,109 charactersyamar68, Nov 18, 2012

4.89/5  rDev +9.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52012 vintage. 750ml bottle split between myself, legend8706, and a couple other buddies. Divided equally into wine glasses. Special night, to say the least!
A- Poured a deep murky brown, but not quite black. Very little foam head, but what is there sticks around for a while. Nice light lacing.
S- There is an almost overwhelming aroma of bourbon immediately. Huge on the oak and lots of vanilla. There is also some chocolate here, and perhaps a bit of smokiness as well, although I think that is the wood coming through. It does burn the nostrils a bit, like an actual bourbon or some such high proof liquor.
T- This beer will obviously benefit from some aging, but it is incredible now. Very complex, but easily the best bourbon barrel aged stout I have come across. It is very much like drinking a bourbon. It is pretty sweet, but not just sugary - I am thinking caramel. The oak/woody flavor cuts through well. It is extremely boozy right now, but I suspect that will mellow out in a few years. Ultimately, it has lots of wood, vanilla, bourbon, caramel, chocolate, some bitterness, and plenty of booze (which no one should be surprised at). Mouth is rather thick and syrupy. Carbonation is light. It is creamy and pretty much damn awesome!
O- Black Tuesday was not cheap and was frankly very difficult for me to get my hands on, however, it was worth every penny. I am so glad I was able to enjoy such a truly unique, special beer. This one is not for the faint of heart, but if you are going after it I would guess that you know what you are getting into. I'll see my second bottle in a few years...if I can wait that long. 1,633 charactersbrother_kenneth, Nov 18, 2012

A: Pours a dark coffee-black, lets barely any light through the edges; barely any head, slight oily lacing
S: Strong bourbon/woody notes up front, with hints of leather, vanilla, coconut, and sweet sticky malt. Super complex with a nice woody muskiness that pervades throughout
T: WOW. Starts out with some sweet sticky malts up front; transitions into a roasty/woody sweetness with a strong bourbon backbone along the middle, hints of vanilla, coffee, and chocolate-covered malts; finishes boozy with a nice hint of bitter roasty malt and coconut
M: Ridiculously smooth, with low carbonation and a buttery/oily texture that mellows out the abv. There's a slight amount of heat, but overall the alcohol is hidden exceptionally well. 
O: This beer is beyond good, and well worth all the praise it's getting. I'm glad I got two bottles, because I can't wait to see what it tastes like in a couple years. Definitely gonna try and snag more of these. 1,029 charactersJules11788, Nov 11, 2012

On Tap at the Bruery Tasting Room
2012 vintage
1st Review
Had this beer Tuesday October 30th at the Bruery Black Tuesday release party
A: Pours a dark brownish red, with almost no head. streams of small bubbles stream up from the sides of the Black Tuesday release taster glass. Some alcohol legs are visible from this 19.2% beast.
S: Like previous vintages, the nose on this beer smacks you in the face with bourbon and vanilla. Some oak and alcohol also. 
T: Dark chocolate and coffee are the dominate flavors of this big sugar bomb. There is a faint anise aftertaste. The alcohol burn is a little more pronounced than from previous years. From the first taste this beer shows it’s young age. Even though this beer is blended from many barrels to taste like past years, it needs to lay down for a few months to better blend together. This is my favorite beer; fitting for my first BA review. 
M: Great mouthfeel. Not overly thick or syrupy for how sweet this beer is. A little more carbonation would have benefited this beer.
O: This is a fantastic beer! This is the reason I drink craft beer. I have had many BA stouts (Stone BA IRS, Parabola, Eclipse, Marshal Z, Hunahpu, Silva Stout, World Wide Stout, Abyss and the list goes on and on) and Black Tuesday is the best. It is a prime example of balance in a big boozy, sweet barrel aged stout. This is a must have beer, it lives up to the hype. My overall score will improve as this beer rests for a while. 1,483 charactersPsyko, Nov 03, 2012

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52011 750 ML bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip style glass. As indicated in the name the beer comes out black rising in the glass so no light gets through. The pour itself coming out of the bottle had brown highlights. Swirling it in the glass it has a light cough syrup effect to it. Tan colored head with mostly small bubbles, sticks around to the point of a ring around the edge. Decent glass retention, this looks to be an extremely elite beer. 
Smell is decadently perfect. Sweet bourbon, decadent and fudgy chocolate are dominant. Plenty of vanilla and oak wood aromas come out. Subtlety toasted marshmallows. Heat from the bourbon tones are present, but it's a nice tickle on your nose, very pleasant.
Much like the smell the exquisite rich chocolate tones come out at you, high class and not overly sweet but all delicious. Plenty of bourbon flavors as well, strong tones of vanilla saturated wood, leather, and even some slight tobacco. Feint hints of licorice on the back of the tongue and again with some toasted marshmallows drizzled with melted brown sugar. All parts of this beer work in every aspect. Beer is as good as beer can taste, perfect when it comes to barrel aged stouts. 
Black Tuesday is a full bodied beer, it's heavy with a lingering flavor, but not quite heavy enough where you completely have to chew it (close though). Silky smooth the entire session with a nice carbonation level. Warm finish that doesn't burn at all, just a nice tingling heat to let you know that it's there. 18.3% is nothing to scoff at and how potent this beer is, if someone were to tell you it was a bit lower, it'd be believable based on how drinkable this beer is. This is not a beer to chug, but instead a nice sipper for a night cap. Crazy, crazy drinkable. I could drink a bottle myself, but it's too good not to share and should really just be consumed on occasions where it will be appreciated. Home Run, Slam Dunk, Overtime Goal, Game Winning TD or whatever you want to call it from The Bruery! 2,008 charactersAndyAvalanche, Oct 25, 2012

A not black but dark brown with deep cola edges, no head or lace as expected but some sexy thin legs, looks good but far from as dark as I was expecting 
S almost smells more like bourbon then a beer, booze is strong with some molasses, soy faint teriyaki and even some smoky bacon, I get some woody earthy notes and chocolate, smells pretty good
T the booze is strong but if it wasn’t I’d be concerned, not as much soy but the vanilla and chocolate liqueur that replaces it works better for me, most of what I smells still there in one form or another but improved upon 
M flat but syrupy and thick, much thicker then I’d guess from the color, its hot but manageable, silky boozy and a lovely bourbon aftertaste, well done for such a massive beer
O this is amazing now and I can only imagine what this would be like in a decade or two, pretty intense brew, I need to use some strength getting my lips apart, seriously though diabetes in a glass
I’m pretty stoked I got to try this one and now I feel the need to own one so I can lay it down for ages. This will end up as a truly amazing beer in 10 or 20 years. Thanks for the crack at this one Adam 1,264 characterswordemupg, Oct 17, 2012

A - Pours pitch black with a small and fizzy chocolate-milk colored head. Fades pretty quickly, leaving almost no lacing.
S - Chocolate, molasses, caramel, vanilla, oak, and a good dose of Bourbon. Bourbon does not overwhelm as I was expecting. 
T - Lots of chocolate with bourbon , vanilla and licorice.. As it warms, the dark fruits and sweet brown sugar makes it more complex. A mild alcohol burn is there as a reminder to take your time sipping it.
M - Mouthfeel is nice an coating, oily, slight carbonation. Alcohol is a bit warm but fits the intensity of this beer perfectly.
O - Amazing beer and the best I've had that's over 15% ABV. Can't wait to try Chocolate Rain next. 698 charactersSkiBum22, Oct 07, 2012

750mL bottle poured into a snifter
2011 vintage
A huge thanks goes out to Redbeeron for sending over this big time want over in a trade!  Thanks Matt.
A: Pours a very dark brown, not quite black, with lighter browning on the edges.  Just under 1 fingers width of light mocha colored head quickly settles to an outer ring and wispy center, which remains throughout the drink but leaves no appreciable lacing.  Actually looks rather thin, and not all that impressive.  
S: Aroma on the other hand, is huge, with massive bourbon notes.  Oak, lighter dark fruits such as cherry and plum, an interesting unique character that I can only describe as herbaceous, smokey barbeque sauce, molasses, and booze. I like.  
T: Hugely sweet.  Caramel, candied sugar, some roasted notes, a nonspecific bitterness, bakers chocolate, bourbon, toffee. Incredibly sweet, almost to the degree of Dark Lord, but unlike Dark Lord, there are other characteristics to balance out the sweetness and prevent it from being cloying.   Some booze is noted but in a balancing way, not a dominating way.  I was not terribly impressed at first, but it definitely gets better as it warms, with the other flavors coming out to combat the sweetness.  Finishes strong.  Very tasty beer here.  
M/D: Appropriately low carbonation, slightly syrupy but not terribly so, thicker than it looks,and slightly chewy.  Absolutely incredibly job of masking the absurd ABV.  This is officially the highest ABV beer I have ever drank, just edging out DFH 120, and I never would have guessed it.  Ive had IS's with half the ABV that were hotter than this.  Incredible job in that aspect.  Drinkability is scary good with the first glass poured from the bomber.  In fact, I drank the first half of the bomber way to fast, and had to take a little break to settle my stomach.   After a short recuperation period (and a slice of pizza to balance out the sugary sweetness) I was onto the second glass of the bomber.  And similar to the first, the drinkability is still incredible, however, I made sure to take this one a little slower.  This is made to be a slow sipper, so take your time. 
O: Overall, very good-bordering on great, but IMO not elite.  I do find it incredible how they were able to produce such a drinkable beer with the crazy ABV, and in that sense this beer is a masterpiece.  Unfortunately, I am not a huge fan of the flavor profile, as I tend to shy away from the overly sweet stouts.  However, unlike some of the other crazy sweet IS's (I'm looking at you Dark Lord), this one has much more of a balance, which I mostly attribute to the big bourbon presence.  I dont plan to seek this out as aggressively as some of the other big stouts (for example, KBS, BCBCS, Imperial Biscotti, Darkness, The Abyss, and even MZ are all beers that are far easier to obtain and better beers IMO).  That being said, this  is definitely a beer I would drink any chance I got, I would certainly recommend, and Im glad I got to try. 3,040 characterszac16125, Sep 09, 2012

Pours a deep brune, thick tan head erupts. Nose is thick, sweet tomato paste; bourbon, maple, whoppers candies, vanilla extract. Taste is very sweet, whooo, that is a sweet one. Maple, booze, vanilla try to save something that is overloaded with sweetness from the alcohol level as the brewers are telling me this one actually attenuates very low. So the perceived sugar is really just the abv. I thought the Chocolate Rain felt a little less sweet than this one. The finish on this is also pretty hot unlike the CR. 7/24/2012 7/4/5/3/12=3.1 663 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

Pours dead black with a mere wisp of tan head around the edges. Zero lace. 
Smells of booze right off the bat. Bourbon, roasty malt, cocoa, dried dark fruit, vanilla and caramel. 
In a word- delicious! Bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, roast malt, dark fruits, wood and raw sugar. Booze is there the whole time, as expected with over 18% alcohol. Mighty tasty. 
Thick syrupy feel with mild carbonation. Phenol alcoholic cooling effect. Lingering sweet bourbon aftertaste. 
One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Drinks as easily as a stout with half the alcohol. Thick, sweet and complex. I very much want more. 719 charactersThickNStout, Sep 01, 2012

4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42011 bottle courtesy of forgetfu at our crazy Antwerp tasting. Thanks Bill and everyone else for an amazing night that will long have a special place in my heart and liver. Sampled next to a 2012 Chocolate Rain, in a 50-50 blend of the two and even mixed with a lambic (which was dead gorgeous). Yeah, that's how crazy things got.
A: Pours a very dark chestnut brown going into black. A half-finger head disappates almost immediately, so the high alcohol is definitely noticable in the pour.
S: Not the aroma explosion I expected it to be, but that might be a good thing. Molasses, bourbon, brown sugar, dark and milk chocolate and notes of dark roasted malt. Subtle but enticing.
T: And that's where any subtle qualities in this beer are stopped dead in their tracks. The first thing that hits you is sweet bourbon, molasses, Japanese soy sauce and dried biscuits. Very little in the way of roasted malts, but enough to keep it from being clawingly sweet. The booze is very prominent throughout the whole experience, not only in the finish where I'd like it to be in my big stouts. It's very clear this beast could still do with some aging and won't be at its prime until at least another two years, which I guess is why people are raving about the 2009 bottling right now. As it stands, this is just too hot.
M: Very low carbonation that is only just enough to pull it out of the realm of syrup and remind you that you're drinking a beer. Creamy and smooth. I do think this beer would benefit from being a little thicker, but I doubt that was the effect they were going for with the amount of alcohol in it.
O: "Diabeetus in a bottle" is how I've seen a lot of BA's refer to it, and I see why. The penultimate sharing beer, as it constantly balances on the fine line between a barrel aged big stout and alcoholic syrup. If you have a similar palate to me and like your coffee and dark chocolate as well as your sweetness, you'd most likely go for a Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead the 5th. Though I must say that Black Tuesday is A LOT more balanced than say a Dark Lord, I feel sad to say I won't be counting it amongst the best stouts I've ever had. At least not in its 2011 form. Maybe a bit of age will work wonders on this beast. That 2009 bottle in my cellar is looking mighty tempting now... 2,299 charactersDennoman, Aug 26, 2012

4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A huge thanks to Shaunt and Lev for bringing this down and sharing with us. They cracked the bottle and pour a syrupy, pitch black brew. The only suggestion of a head is in light rings of medium brown bubbles clinging to the edges of the glass. These do, however, remain for the entire tasting. There is such thickness to the beer as it slowly sloshes around the glasses. Carbonation appears average, with bubbles only creeping to the top, and no sediment is noted. The nose is perfection. It is the closest thing to Bourbon County that we’ve ever sniffed. There are huge fiery alcohols from the softest, most beautiful bourbon aging. The aroma is so hot!! It really stings the nostrils, almost making you cough as it enters your lungs. The malts are deep, showing insane roast of melted, burnt milk chocolate. This adds an incredible sweetness to it, cutting the booze. Alongside the bourbon is a soft woodiness, that actually moves to soften the alcohol as well. Our first impression is that the flavoring is surprisingly sweet, but phenomenal. As we sip, char and chocolate malts, and the sting of fusel 19% booze hits your palate. Raw honey and milk chocolate sugariness effectively cut any boozy bitterness that might have been, and actually go one step further to even box out the booze a bit, right here in the front. The peak showcases this sweetness, but a more charred, caramel malt comes in, adding even more sweetness. The bourbon is warming and wrapped throughout everything, with its buttery, biting goodness. Helping to pull us to the end is a nice, authentic black cherry flavoring, again, adding more sweetness. The end is all about the bourbon, bourbon, bourbon, with a little bit of bourbon, and some more bourbon. There is certainly the accompanying soft woodiness and musk, but these only add to the exquisite flavoring of that spirit. The aftertaste is fumes, with wood, char, fire, white sugar, and sweet chocolates. The body is syrupy and thick, while the carbonation is low. There is huge fusel dryness, and each sip stings the tongue like fire. There is nice smack and great slurp to each sip, but little inherent frothiness. The beer is extremely warming, as the abv is atmospheric, but it drinks easily. You drink slowly though, because you hate to see it go.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the aroma and the flavoring. These are both near perfection. The abv is a bit scary, but they mask it expertly. They somehow were able to eliminate most of the burning, fusel qualities of the ethanol that make taking shots so bad, while keeping the juicy, warming, spiciness of the bourbon. The chocolate and sugary inclusions helped to keep this in check, no doubt, and we were surprised to find such an ultimately sweet tasting beer. This is a superb beer, and we are so thankful that we got to enjoy it. 2,847 charactersTheBrewo, Aug 20, 2012

Poured into a snifter glass. Deepest darkest black, with a thin light brown head that dissolves quite quickly under its own weight. A think little smattering of foam is all that survives. You can see the weight on this as it pours. 
Nose is sweet and sugary, with notes of roasted malt, molasses, bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, caramel and a slight peat or leather quality. Rich and inviting. 
Well this is all kinds of wonderful. Definitely a sharing bottle, even if the ABV wasn't as high as it is. Rich stout flavours, very sweet, with assertive notes of bourbon, chocolate, sugar and vanilla. The booze is certainly there, but despite being 18%, it tastes more like around a 10%er, which makes for some dangerous drinking indeed. A headache-inducing brew, but oh-so-worth it. 
Medium-high thickness, mild carbonation, creamy on the palate. Drinks like a liqueur. 
Terrific double stout, very sweet, full of flavour. When drinking this brew I had that calm euphoria folks must have felt in the late 1920s with stocks at what Irving Fisher described as a "permanently high plateau". The high ABV hit me a short while later, with the high sugar content causing an irreversible crash. With a brew this good, however, it won't take a war to get me on my feet again. Terrific stuff, well worth a pickup. Share this brew, or don't come crying to me later. 1,476 charactersJohnnyBarman, Aug 20, 2012

A- Pours a deep brown color, nearly black, some mahogany hues at the edges, produces a thin brown head that recedes to a collar, leaves no lacing but has some nice legs.
S- Very big, rich aroma, lots of bourbon and dry wood. The aroma also has some sweet notes of chocolate, vanilla, and molasses. Some coffee and roasted grain as well. Surprisingly it isn't that boozy for 18%.
T- Lots of sweet sugar and vanilla up front, as the sweetness subsides flavors of chocolate, caramel, molasses and bourbon become more prominent, there's also some roast and coffee flavor towards the finish, which is fruity and has caramel flavors. Really delicious stuff, it's very sweet and very boozy but not in an overpowering way, very drinkable and balanced.
M- Full-bodied, thick and chewy feel, moderate to low carbonation, boozy warmth is noticeable but isn't hot.
O- A delicious beer, the richness and complexity of flavor is really incredible, it's a fantastic sipping beer but is also not as hot or sweet as you might expect for such a massive beer, this is my favorite beer from the Bruery, which is really saying something. 1,179 charactersWillCarrera, Jul 29, 2012

A- Pours a deep black with a thin mocha head that leaves no lacing behind.
S- Harsh alcohol, dark fruit including prunes and raisins and some sugary sweetness. The 18% is making itself known.
T- Bourbon hits the palate followed by loads of candied sugar, roasted malt, prune juice, raisins and black cherry. Damn, this is incredibly sweet and is pretty much diabetes in a bottle. Really no balance or complexity for that matter. Maybe some chocolate and caramel, but the alcohol and sugar overpower pretty much any flavor. 
M- Medium carbonation and a syrupy body with the heat lingering on.
O- It's amazing how undrinkable this beer was. Way too much sugary sweetness paired with the harsh booziness. It was a chore to drink 3 ounces. The hype behind this and Chocolate Rain confuse me as both are just hot boozy messes. 946 charactersiadler, Jul 28, 2012

2011 vintage. 
The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a few brown bubbles but no real head. 
The aroma is awesome. I get a ton of bourbon and molasses notes, as well as some raisins, chocolate and roasted malt. The other barrel-aged notes also come through and contribute quite a bit of maple and oak. 
The flavor is just as good, if not better than the aroma. The first notes are some sweet chocolate, which is quickly followed by a heavy amount of bourbon. I also get some great maple, oak and vanilla notes from the barrel-aging process, as well as some coffee and brown sugar. The alcohol is very present and the beer is extremely sweet.

Beautiful opaque black brown with red shades, although very little head. Extremely volatile, the alcohol brings an wide aroma spectrum: dark fruits, cherries, bourbon, molasses and coconut. Flavors are pure chocolate (almost brownies) and bourbon with some cherries. Rich bodied and low carbonation, almost like a syrup. It was very tasty but too heavy to be pleasant to drink in large servings. An event in itself. 479 charactersLuk13, Jul 17, 2012

Nose is a bit boozy, but huge "usual" stout smells. Wayyy more chocolate than a typical stout though. The bourbon blends in nicely and doesn't overpower the beer at all. Just so much chocolate. A bit hot still, but I suppose that'll happen with 18% +. Mouthfeel, to me, for the size of the beer, is actually a bit small. Not as thick and vicious as I would expect, but still pretty full. Overall, this is one that I cannot wait to age for the next 5 years. Fantastic beer that lives up to the hype. So glad I finally got to try this. 650 characters1Adam12, Jul 14, 2012

Black Tuesday is one-of-a-kind. That said, World Wide Stout scratches the same itch, IMO, and WWS is so much easier to get. But don't get me wrong -- Black Tuesday is without a doubt the superior beer. So incredibly smooth for 18%. 458 charactersMavajo, Jul 11, 2012

A-Opaque black. Darker then the darkest night. Pours with little carbonation and not a lot of head. This is surely a big imperial stout just by the look.
S-Licorice, notes of cherry, and bourbon. Burnt wood/ leathery. Smells delicious
T-The first thing I get is the sweetness. Expected from a beer this big. It's not overly sweet. I think the barrel aging helped it out. Then the bourbon comes through along with the deep roasted notes. I get cherry on the pallet, much like I did w/ Dark Lord. Toasted vanilla and charred oak
M-Motor Oil. It is think and sticky and awesome. The body lingers on the mouth for long after the beer is gone. 
O- This beer is a beast. And at 18%+ it drinks like 10%, which isn't saying much because that is still big. the alcohol burn is there, but not what you would expect from something this big. I has Melange #3 which i thought was fantastic. This beer has reached the expectations that I had for this beer. I will seek out again for the cellar. When the Patrick and Tyler do it right, they do it right. 1,177 charactersBrewsoBrewco, Jul 03, 2012

The aroma gives off lots of rich molasses and cinnamon spice with hints of spicy cinnamon. Lots of richness and heavy bourbon in the background. This one is super sweet on the pallet with spicy sweet cinnamon and molasses. It's good at first but after a couple sips the bourbon comes through quite a bit but it wrecks the pallet after a few.
The body on this is heavy and thick. Syrupy even with soft carbonation. 
Overall this one has tons of flavors that work together alright. After a few sips I think this just destroys the pallet. That's really what kill it for me; you can only taste it for the first few sips, afterwards your pallet is just hot ruined. 812 charactersBendurgin, Jun 29, 2012
4.02/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a red wine glass. The color is black with a nice medium tan head. this looks good.
The aroma has a nice dose of vanilla with loys of dark fruit. Bendurgin mentions cinnamon and I notice that too.
The taste is very sweet with a good portlike flavor. I get a lot of raisin in the flavor. Pretty good, but it might be a bit too sweet for many. The alcohol flavor is well integrated in this one.
This is of course a full bodied slow sipper with subtle carbonation. I like this. I would get it again. 510 charactersandrewinski1, Jun 29, 2012

Pours a thick dark oil like body with light tan head that rings but doesn't lace. Liquid chocolate. Hints of liquorice & bourbon. So easy to drink. No heat at all for the high ABV. Sweet, but with a thinner finish. This is dessert in a glass. I could drink a whole bottle of this to myself, and then find myself under the table... 471 characterskjyost, Jun 20, 2012

Poured from 750 ml bottle into a Half Acre tulip.
A- Pours black with a 1 finger light tan head. Small bubbles form along the edge of the glass and reside quickly.
S- Big chocolate, bourbon, hint of vanilla, and some leather.
T- Very sweet chocolate, licorice, lots of bourbon, and some heat at the finish.
M- Full body, medium carbonation. Huge beer, definitely a sipper from the heat this beer brings.
O- What can I say? Huge beer with a ton of sweet chocolate and big bourbon notes. 573 characterskawilliams81, Jun 19, 2012

O: Awesome beer, had back to back with Chocolate Rain. This one has a strong alcohol heat that leads to an intense sweetness. As it warms to 70 degrees appx, It really smooths out. Another sipper. Take your time and enjoy this one. It's a solid 4.4 to me. 571 charactersTATURBO, Jun 17, 2012

A: Dark as night with a medium brown head: think caramel or toasted almond. About two fingers that quickly receded to a ring of film that rested around the walls of the glass. 
S: Initially the nose is dominated by bourbon (really pleasant vanilla notes) and a considerable amount of heat; there is a decent amount of oak that lingers in the background. 
T: Big bourbon notes upfront, which are followed by a considerable amount of bitter dark chocolate/caramel sweetness; a bit of dark fruit is showcased out the back (raisins/figs/sweet plum). 
M: light carbonation with a syrupy consistency. 
O: "Its too much of a heavy muffin." However, there are really interesting flavors being showcased in both the taste and aroma. If the beer was toned down a notch in the alcohol department, it would really allow all of the other aspects to shine at their full potential. One last note: as the beer began to warm, the sweetness increased exponentially.

4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a thick deep brown and a nice dark tan head. The aroma is overwhelming of bourbon and sweet chocolate. Just by the aroma you can tell it's a strong beer. 
Taste is very complex and rich, dark chocolate mixed with coffee and maybe some vanilla, bourbon and oak are strong as well without one flavor dominating, it's a bit hard to put a finger on what your tasting at a single moment. The bourbon might be the most dominate which kinda detracts from the beer goodness I know is underneath.
The mouthfeel is indeed very thick and rich and to be honest a bit hard to drink by itself and needs a nice food complement to I think fully enjoy the nuances of this beer. 
Overall a great beer, but a couple things need to be better balanced to hide the bourbon a bit more and to ease the drinkability... needs to be smoothed out. I had a 2011 bottle so it's likely aged bottles will be better balanced. 901 charactersProspero, Jun 05, 2012

A- Dark brown, a little light and a little thin on the pour for a traditional stout. Black Tuesday had a decent head on it which really surprised me, good amount of noticeable carbonation.
S- I've been told that the aroma is the best part of this, and while I'm not 100% sure if I agree with that, the aroma was awesome. Instant flavors of vanilla and bourbon come through primarily, followed by some burning on the nose from the alcohol. There isn't too much booze in the aroma but you have to expect some when a beer's ABV is this high. There weren't many particular qualities of a stout that I could smell though, I didn't detect any coffee or chocolate which I was expecting. It was very sweet.
T- Incredibly smooth. If I had to guess what the ABV was I would've said it was significantly lower than 18% which is impressive to me. It tastes very sweet, but those vanilla and bourbon flavors are very present. Although it has a predominant bourbon flavor though, it isn't overpowering at all and it doesn't take away from how smooth this beer is. 
M- I like a stout to be thick, and although it looked a little thin on the pour, it was actually pretty close to perfect. It coats the mouth and glass very well. Not much carbonation on this one, and I wasn't expecting it.
O- I really liked this beer, but I think I liked it the least out of everyone who tried it with me. The drinkability is exceptional and the flavors are well balanced. My palate just doesn't agree with sweet beers and this one got sweeter as it warmed up. I will definitely enjoy this again when I open the bottle I'm aging, I just couldn't have more than 1/4th of it. I will say though that this is by far the best Bruery beer I've had because thus far they haven't impressed me very much.

4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Irishcolonial for sharing this the other night. 2011 vintage poured from a 750ml bottle. It poured dark brown in color, and pretty close to black. A very thin tan lacing formed along the edges of the glass. 
The first thing that is immediately noticeable in the aroma is the boozy and hot alcohol presence. I do get a lot of nice, rich, dark chocolate and roasted malts to it coming through that I really like. The bourbon seems to add to the hot alcohol presence to it and the notes of vanilla, oak and brown sugar are a little overshadowed by that. It has some very nice, rich flavors to it, but the alcohol showed too much for me.
The taste is rich with dark chocolate up front and bitter roasted malts in the finish. I get some really nice notes of vanilla and booze soaked fruits to it. The bourbon comes through as mostly alcohol heat with some brown sugar and oak notes trying to come out. 
The mouthfeel Is oily and a little thick with carbonation being low. Overall, it was pretty good but not as great as I anticipated. The hot, boozy alcohol overshadowed some of the really great flavors to me. I can easily imagine this moving from very good to great with a few years of age on it. Hopefully I'll get a chance to revisit. 1,246 charactersbillab914, May 31, 2012

A: Pours thick and rich and is pitch black in the glass with only faint red edges revealed by a strong back light. A rough pour yields a small, dark tan head that did not dissipate that quickly. 
S:Rich chocolate, plenty of sweet dark caramel and rich bourbon with notes of light vanilla, thick molasses and oak. 
T:Decadently sweet, chocolate, caramel and bourbon explosion that is ultra smooth and no lingering taste of alcohol.The alcohol is only noted through warming in the esophagus and stomach. 
A must taste - yet as a side note - many of the bourbon barrel aged beers at the Bruery are very similar. 625 charactersmrtripod, May 29, 2012

The beer pours jet black with no head except for a thin halo around the edges. The smell is slightly bready with tons of booziness. The cloying sweetness is absolutely absurd at first considering it's far sweeter than most barleywines I've had. However, the magic that this sweetness works is a beer with an 18%abv is now suddenly very drinkable and the alcohol that made this beer smell nearly toxic at first has literally vanished from the beer's profile. The taste leaves a lingering caramelized sugar/maple syrup sweetness followed by a slight burn from the alcohol letting you know it's still there. It has a potent, warming mouthfeel and I can see why this beer made such an excellent addition to the melange 3. This beer did me in for the night...couch time. 803 charactersThePorterSorter, May 27, 2012

A: Pours pitch black with a smallish and fizzy chocolate-milk colored head. Fades pretty quickly, leaving almost no lacing.
S: I can smell this one across the room. Overload of bourbon with tons of caramel, toffee, vanilla, rum-soaked raisins, figs and oak. Roasted malt isn't overpowered, there is plenty of char and chocolate in there too. Just a hint of brown sugar. Boozy (duh). 
T: Very similar to the smell. Loaded with stinging bourbon up front. Caramel, molasses, toffee primarily. Then the fruit kicks in with raisin, fig and oaky vanilla. Brown sugar is stronger here in the middle. Bourbon fades leaving the massive roasted malt. Chocolate mainly, lots of it. Just a hint of coffee and char mixed in with the lingering bourbon flavors. Super sweet molasses and brown sugar in the aftertaste, not unlike a big english barleywine (ie: JW Lees). Decent alcohol burn but not as bad as you'd expect (something like WWS is much harsher). The extreme sweetness helps balance it out.
M: Heavy, thick, smooth other than the alcohol burn.
O: Huge and delicious beer. Honestly, it tastes like someone mixed a big stout with a big english barleywine and barrel aged it. There is a SUPER sweet molasses and caramel element to go along with the bourbon and roasted malt that really reminds of of a barleywine. It cannot be emphasized enough how sweet this beer is, it is pure craziness. I actually wish there were more roasted malt to help balance out the sweetness, but given the huge ABV it would probably make the beer very harsh. Regardless, an intense beer that isn't just intense for the sake of a laugh. It's actually very tasty, reasonably well balanced and pretty drinkable given the ABV. I enjoyed it a lot. All 1200+ calories. Whew. 1,758 charactersDope, May 25, 2012

750ml bottle
A - Pours pitch black with a one finger tan head that dissipates quickly. lacing is minimal...
S - Chocolate, molasses, caramel, vanilla, oak, and a good dose of Bourbon. Bourbon does not overwhelm as I was expecting. Very enticing...
T - Chocolate, molasses, oak/vanilla, and sweet caramel. Notes of roasted barley come through, but they are faint. This one is deliciously sweet. Bourbon and lingering vanilla on the finish. Bourbon is extremely smooth considering the abv. Amazing...
M - Smooth and creamy. Very impressed with how incredibly smooth this is. Drinks like a much smaller brew. Sits somewhere on the lighter side of full bodied scale with a moderate amount of carbonation...
O - Believe the hype. This one is fantastic. The Bruery definitely hit one out of the park here. Very excited to revisit this in the future...

S: huge amount of bourbon, sweet caramel, some slight roasted notes, but mostly the bourbon, caramel, and vanilla. 
T: yes, it comes with a lot of heat on it. As it should be. The taste is dominated by bourbon flavors, which is beautiful with the huge stout flavors that lie below the surface. 
M: I can't believe it was this carbonated for a stout this big, even if they force carbonated it. Thick body, medium-high carbonation. 
O: fantastic brew overall, but I wish it hadn't gushed on me. Lost a couple dollars of beer in a few seconds. Anyhow, this is a beauty, but it's not worth having if you don't like big bourbon flavors or if you're turned off by alcohol.

Pours black and viscous with a mocha colored foam that doesn't last long.
Smells as you might expect from such a big beer, tons of bourbon, chocolate covered dark fruits, roasted malt, vanilla, and a moderate alcohol burn, but to be expected for the high abv.
Taste is incredible. Lots of chocolate integrated with bourbon barrel, vanilla, licorice, tiramisu. As it warms, the dark fruits and sweet brown sugar makes it more complex. A mild alcohol burn is there as a reminder to take your time sipping it.
Low carbonation, but enough to keep it from being too heavy. The full body and complexity of flavors go well together, makes for a great night cap.
I had the 2011 when it first came out and remember it being way too sweet and too hot at the time. On the other hand, the 2009 is fantastic, the sweetness and alcohol burn has mellowed and the flavors are complex. I think age has helped this beer a lot, although some say the recipe was supposedly different. Delicious beer overall, just have to remember to pace myself with it next time around - waking up the next morning was rough. 1,136 charactersislandboi8204, Apr 19, 2012

After three straight extremely long and rough days, this was needed. Poured into a HF snifter at 54 degrees, although I let it warm up a little before diving in. 2009 bottle, 19.5%. And another one bites the dust.
A - Pours a blackish-brown with a tan head that quickly gets down to some mild lacing. Sticks well, lacing returns upon each sift. 
S - Slight tingle to the nose hair....deep raisin, fudge, bourbon barrel is more on the vanilla side. There is a decent amount of the fudge coming through.
T - Again, there is a slight amount of burn that underlies the entire flavor. Raisin, fudge, dark malts, sweet vanilla, lightest oak in the finish. After the first sip coats the tongue, any amount of heat is gone. The barrel flavor is balanced well against the sweetness, and the finish shows no dryness. 
M - Thicker mouthfeel that is heavy on the tongue. The light carbonation is a little bit prickly on the tongue, but that could be the 19.5% coming through instead.
O - This is among the best BA RIS I've ever had. This year in particular, not at all the '10/'11. Maybe it is the different recipe, maybe the time in the barrel, maybe the bottles just need time. There are a lot of wonderful similarities between this and an '07 BCBS. Barrel forward, fudge is evident. 1,352 charactersclaaark13, Apr 15, 2012

Appeared black as night with a quickly dissipating small khaki colored head. Slightly oily in appearance.
Smelled of roasted/burnt malts, licorice, chocolate, booze-soaked plums and raisins, woods, and a bit of vanilla.
Begins with flavors of dark fruits, licorice and chocolate. Then comes in some of the barrel notes – vanilla, wood, bourbon. Finishes with some alcohol and more roasted malt flavors. Very intense, yet enjoyable.
Mouth feel is nice an coating, oily, slight carbonation. Alcohol is a bit warm but fits the intensity of this beer perfectly. Not one to be pounded.
I must say, this is fantastic. So complex, so much going on. At first the alcohol was a bit overpowering, but after drinking a glass of this you see that it fits in perfectly. I would like to try one of these with 3-4 years on it to see how it tastes a bit more blended. Wow… 907 charactersTWStandley, Apr 10, 2012

Jet black, no light coming through this at all, ring of dark tan head, decent retention with very light lace. Smell is full of bourbon and oak, sweet scents come off in the way of bakers and milk chocolate, roasted and charred notes, coffee grinds, getting some coconut as well at points, but possibly the finest integration of bourbon and oak to a stout I have ever smelled. Taste like the nose is full of bourbon, definite sweetness but not cloying and about halfway through the glass it was basically unnoticeable, roasted malt, chocolate and coffee show up in generous amounts, incredibly complex, alcohol adds some heat but not as present as I expected. Lightly carbonated, full body and creamy, full feel but a times a little syrupy and thick, needed some sips of water every so often during this. Incredible stuff here, wish I had a bottle of my own to open up 5 years down the road but I was more than happy with a tulip of this beauty that I thought I would never get to try. 1,042 characterspeensteen, Apr 06, 2012

4.59/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have had this beer multiple times over the last few years, this rating will be a combination of them all. The numerical ratings are from a 09 bottle. I recently brought a 2011 bottle to Imminent Liquidation II so I decided to finally write a review.
A - Pours pitch black with a nice one and a half finger tall tan head leaving a good amount of lace down the sides of the glass.
S - Smells of milk chocolate, vanilla, dark roasted malt, bourbon, dark fruits, oak, brown sugar and some oak. The booze is apparent throughout. I can not think of anything more I would want in an imperial stout.
T - Starts off with a ton of chocolaty sweetness and lots of warm bourbon quickly giving way to a mix of dark roasted malt, vanilla, dark fruit and brown sugar. Finish has some sweet heat with some lingering dry oak tannins.
M - Big, smooth, boozy feel that is just great. I prefer these with a year or so on them to help kill some of the booze. There is no doubt that this is one big beer.
O - This is undoubtedly one of the best imperial stouts out there. When it is fresh it can be a little too harsh for my liking but once the booze mellows it really comes into its own. I will never turn down one of these. 1,210 charactersorangesol, Mar 28, 2012

2011 vintage.
Pours an opaque super dark brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of dark roasted malt, vanilla, wood, and bourbon aromas. Taste is amazing and is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an exceptional stout with a fantastic barrel aged presence. 536 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 18, 2012

A - A nice finger of tan foam settles to a thick collar but minimal lacework. Black body with a glint of brown at the edges of the glass. Pretty impressive at 18.2%.
S - Huge bourbon barrel presence, with plenty of dry wood, whiskey, vanilla, and dark chocolate. Only mild roast and coffee flavors in the periphery. Intensely rich, with well-hidden alcohol - most people who tried this would have never guessed it was over 18%.
T - Taste is quite similar, with massive amounts of chocolate, vanilla, and lighter touch of bourbon, barrel, and caramel. Again, there's minimal roast character, resulting in this being very sweet. Still it was quite easy to drink and never became cloying.
M - Viscous and shake-like full body, with enough carbonation to get things from getting too heavy or sludge-like. Some alcohol warmth, but nothing untoward. Pretty creamy, with only mild barrel tannin presence. I expected a slightly heavier beer at 18.2%, but I appreciate that this drinks like it has an ABV in the low teens.
D - Really enjoyable stuff - the 2011 seems to be developing nicely as I thought it was a bit boozy last time I had it just before Christmas. I know there's been backlash against the hype on this beer, but it's really excellent and among the Bruery's best offerings. Just make sure you have friends on hand, as drinking more than 6oz will put you in the fast lane to incomprehensibility. 1,546 charactersMasterSki, Mar 18, 2012

Black body, mild tan head, average lace. Mildly carbonated. Complex aroma: roasty malts, caramel, toffee, plenty of booze, vanilla, and chocolate.
Roasty with lots of malty sweetness. Torrents of caramel, toffee, vanilla, and chocolate amidst the boozy background. Turns sweeter and more boozy as it warms. Still plenty of fermentable sugars present; this beer will be awesome in a year or two.
The 2010 BT we had a few weeks back alongside Chocolate Rain was a significantly better beer. I won't be opening my other 2011s for at least 1.5 years. Great potential, needs time! 606 charactersbrystmar, Mar 10, 2012

A-Pours jet black with minimal lacing. No head really, just some excitement when swirled
S-Bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla, and darker fruits.
T-A super slick and boozy stout with lots of alcohol notes. It is very chocolatety and really it is potent. There are some date notes but not much more.
M-Barely any carbonation. Absolutely perfect for this beer.
O-This beer is really hard to describe. It is pretty much everything you would imagine it to be. Incredibly alcoholic and tastes better than most other beers. Super thick yet slick with very good flavor that is masked in bourbon. The bourbon is strong but overdominates a little but I do not care that much. It is a great brew for special occasions. 775 charactersbeerhan, Mar 05, 2012

A: Beer poured pretty thick. It is not as black as expected, but still reasonably dark. Head (vanilla toffee coloured) last at all. Holding the beer up to the light reveals a edge that turns from red to gold.
S: The smell is a delicate, mature blend of the following flavours, in the order that I identified them: butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, toffee, molasses, very dark chocolate, dates, plums, prunes, stewed peaches, pecan nuts, whiskey, strawberries, some alcohol notes and liquorice.
T: Wow. This beer is extremely sweet. Burnt caramel, cigar tobacco, toffee and molasses make up the majority of the taste. The alcohol presence grows as the beer warms up.
M: A very thick, sticky beer that is very smoothly carbonated. The mouthfeel has such a pleasant feel to it that it actually distracts from the reviewing process.
O: This is an extremely easy-to-drink beer that has a very executive feel to it. 925 charactersGary779, Feb 28, 2012

2011 Vintage
Futura123, I cannot thank you enough for hooking me up with this one. I have wanted to try Black Tuesday since I first saw rave reviews popping up in 2009. It was a beer that I really thought I would never get to try. Thanks again man!
Appearance: Black Tuesday pours thick and viscous and is pitch black in the glass with only faint red edges revealed by a strong back light. A rough pour yields a small, dark tan head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves very little lace; however a quick swirl causes the head to reform and leaves a sticky yellow-brown residue on the glass. 
Smell: Mmmmm, this smells insanely delicious! Rich chocolate, sweet dark caramel and bourbon are noted right off of the bat, with notes of vanilla, molasses, dark fruits(figs, dates and raisons), sweet chocolate brownie batter, toasted nuts (pecan) and oak all coming into the picture only moments later. Warming yields light soya sauce, liquorice, toasted coconut and some nose tingling alcohol (the only flaw I could find in the nose!). 
Taste: Holy shit; I knew this was going to be one delicious beer, but nothing could have prepared me for the sweet, decadent, chocolate, caramel and bourbon explosion of the first sip! I cannot believe that an 18%, bourbon barrel aged beer can hide its alcohol so incredibly well - I would have guessed 10-12% at the most! 
Flavour notes include: Sweet chocolate, burned brown sugar, dark caramel, bourbon, very light vanilla, molasses, a hint of liquorice, port, sweet stewed dark fruits (figs, and raisins), cigar tobacco, very light roast, and a touch of oak. 
The alcohol is only noted through warming in the esophagus and stomach. 
Mouthfeel: Perfect! Full, thick, sticky body with a low level of smooth, velvety carbonation. 
Overall: Black Tuesday is certainly on of the best beers I have had to date! My mind is made up, I need to move to Cali!!! 1,973 charactersThehuntmaster, Feb 26, 2012

2013 batch
First rated on the date of this post, this review was written 05/12/14
A standard-bearer for big, barrel-aged ales - in age-ability, drinkability and sheer awesomeness. 
A: A pour indistinguishable from motor oil - even has that "glug-glug-glug" sound famous in Warner Brother cartoons. A coffee-tan head attempts to form but is quickly pulled down by its own weight. 
S: To say this is booze-forward is stating the obvious. At 20% ABV no one is looking for masked alcohol (at least they shouldn't be). But along with hot booze are notes of oak, ripe cherry, toasted malts, burnt sugar. 
T: Along with the notes described in the nose, there's a decadent butter-rum note, blending nicely with bourbon flavors. Layered and complex yet insanely balanced (a catchphrase, I know, but appropriate here). There's actually a noticeable touch hop astringency toward the finish, which is long and lingering. 
M: Chewy and viscous, but appropriately so. The brew's huge complexion works to amplify and resonate with its bold flavors. 1,072 charactersrand, Feb 26, 2012

Wow. Let me just put that out there to start. Poured a super deep black, with a nice subtle tan head. Everything you'd expect in the aroma was right there. Big bourbon notes, with that burnt sugar/toffee/caramel scents. One of the best tasting beers I've had in a long time. Utterly complex, full of bourbon, toffee, and hints of vanilla that completely hid the ABV. Nice smooth finish, something truly amazing. 424 charactersKranders, Feb 17, 2012

Thanks to pixieskid for sharing this one. It was a helluva night for beer.
When the crown was pried on this one, it was a gusher despite being fridge cold. The beer gushed maybe two ounces of beer, then immediately died out. It's like the beer was force carbonated, but the carbonation never actually made it into the beer. Pours black and obviously viscous with complete opacity. I could smell this beast as soon as I tapped it - it was like a chocolate tawny port. The nose on the beer was amazing with stone chocolate, dates, malt, malt, malt. The alcohol on the nose is strong, if not intimidating, but oddly inviting - like a bully in school you really admire. The flavor of this beer is fucking awesome. I am not particularly articulate in this form of verse, but I can say this - that bitch is fine! Thick and flat, just like in the Rare BCS, the lack of carb was fitting to this beer and I believe allowed for higher appreciation of the notes. A sincerely delicious beer, it made me smile when I drank it. The beer won the night for me. 1,069 charactersharrymel, Feb 16, 2012

A: This one pours a deep dark black color. Not as thick as I was expecting for this big a beer. I actually got some reddish hues around the corners of the glass. Surprised to see about a half finger of tan head with all that alcohol. Tons of alcohol feet on this one, which is to be expected. Sheets of lacing are present on the swirl.
S: This has an amazing nose to it. I got the bourbon first, obviously. Then you get toffee and some burnt brown sugar and some caramel malty notes. Also the normal culprits, vanilla and oak (mild) are there.
T: Mind officially blown with this one! You don't taste the alcohol! On a 18% beer!?!?! I got tons of those caramel and toffee flavors. Also some dark fruit: rum soaked raisin, prunes, plums, etc. The bourbon is there with subtle hints of vanilla, but it isn't as pronounced as what you took from the nose. You do get a little warming in the back of the throat, but like another reviewer mentioned this drinks like a much lesser ABV beer. As it warms I get some of those coconut notes as well. It's pretty sweet actually, but not overdone
M: Full bodied for sure. Not a ton of carbonation, but some that helps clear the palate (a little).
O: This is most certainly an A+ beer for me. Probably in my Top 3 for sure. It's just so well balanced and delicious. And with the ABV hidden the way it is, I was just blown away. Bravo to the Bruery. Solid work! 1,545 charactersinlimbo77, Feb 10, 2012

Mouth Feel was creamy, thick, full body, light carbonation and a big alcohol warming. The 18% is not masked in this big boy.

Pours a tar black body with nothing but a ring on the side of the glass. Like staring into an abyss.
Sweet aromas of dark chocolate nibs. Vanilla and a good amount of roasted nuts. Lots of boozy bourbon barrel aromas as well.
Starts of with a rich dark chocolate flavor with a good dose of bitterness. Vanilla and wood tones. Bourbon booze, but it goes down smooth. Some licorice. Very viscous in the mouth.
This lives up to the hype. A top class stout. One to seek out. 507 characterslitheum94, Feb 08, 2012

T - A sweet stout, you can mos def taste the booze in it. I'm glad I have two of these, that way I can compare with some age on it.
M - you can tell the abv, but easy to drink. Not a lot of carbonation, which is the way I prefer stouts of this abv.

Love the way this sits on the tongue. There's nothing I don't enjoy about this beer.
One of my favorite things about BT is that it has such a high abv and it is such a thick beer that it is not advised to drink an entire bottle to one's self. Instead it basically begs to be shared among friends & family. 484 charactersMisterKilderkin, Feb 02, 2012

Bottle to Westvletren 12 (small) chalice
Vintage 2011
Enjoyed as part of the "main event" at our Utrecht tasting (December 2011) as a result of Jeffo and doopiedoopiedoo's generosity. Thanks guys...can't wait to return the favor! Drank side-by-side with Black Damnation V - Double Black.
A: Deep brown, nearly opaque. 0.75 (soft mocha) fingernail head on vigorous pour.
S: Bourbon, Ghirardelli dark chocolate brownies, roasted dark malt, fig, vanilla, oak, and more booze (i.e. bourbon). It smells "hot", but this is masked well by some of the other notes coming off the nose.
T: In-your-face from the start with a very strong bourbon presence (too much for my liking though). Balance of dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, and molasses, but seems to be a bit lop-sided for my liking. I'd like a bit more of the dark fruit to come thru, but all-in-all not too bad.
M: Full boded with medium carbonation.
O: This vintage needs a bit of age to mellow out as this beer is drinking a bit hot now. Robust and thick, but just not (entirely) well-rounded yet. Double Black was victorious in the head-to-head battle, but I look forward to trying this again in the future. A big, bold, and good offering from Patrick and Co. at The Bruery! 1,246 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 30, 2012

Review #650
Absolute pitch black in appearance. The liquid poured super oily and was topped by a thin wisp of caramel colored froth. Within seconds, the head dissolved to a clingy ring.
The nose was outrageously rich and fragrant. Super sweet with strong brown sugar and molasses notes. Raisins, prunes and dates were definitely noticeable as well. Lots of deep, dark roasted malts. The bourbon character was definitely present but the booziness must have mellowed with time. What remained were intense notes of vanilla and toasted coconut. There was a definite port wine-like aspect as well.
The flavor profile was even more impressive than the aroma. Massive amounts of roasted and caramel malts appeared on the front end. Tons of brown sugar and sweet cream. As in the nose, bourbon was definitely noticeable but the booziness was amazingly well contained. This beer seriously drank like something in the 12-13% ABV range. Strong molasses and port notes. Some French roast coffee and bakers chocolate. Vanilla and toasted coconut notes played a major role in the taste as well. The finish was sweet and mellow, yet not cloying in the least bit.
Black Tuesday was undoubtedly the most thick and viscous monster of a beer I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. The motor oil-like liquid contained a fine, mild effervesce which lent the beer a surprisingly supple creaminess. Simply amazing.
This 2009 vintage bottle of Black Tuesday was hands down the best stout of any type I have ever tried, and perhaps my favorite beer overall. Despite the ridiculously high ABV (19.5%), the alcohol was so well melded into the flavor profile. I wound up splitting my bottle four ways but felt like I could have put down at least half of it myself (although I might not be standing afterward).
Bottles of these beasts sell for over $300 on eBay and now I understand why. 1,977 charactersDamian, Jan 22, 2012

S: Lots of bourbon, oak, booze, dark fruits, roasted malts; this smells so hot--so boozy and sweet and yet incredible
T: Wow, that is boozy--so much bourbon and oak and dark fruits but man does it all mingle so well together; this beer will probably age really well but it is so damn good fresh
F: Viscous, thick, syrupy, awesome mouth feel
O: This is an amazing beer--it is so boozy but some dark fruits and roasty malts do linger making this a world class beer: one of my favorites 602 charactersdbossman, Jan 22, 2012

Bottle poured into a wine glass.
Pours black, with a bit of light seeping through giving dark brown edges. Tan head quickly retreats and leaves no form of lacing. When tilting the glass it looks a bit thinner than I previously imagined. 
Bourbon barrel is very intense with lots of vanilla and charred oak. Rich chocolate, brown sugar, and dark fruit are all present. 
Wow. Very sweet from the malt and chocolate. Barrel character remains very strong in the taste. The dark fruit came out much more so than in the nose. Dark cherries, fig, and plums. 
Carbonation was somewhat low, which was surprising, and the body is medium.
This is one of the best barrel aged stouts I've had, and easily the most rich and intense. A quintessential sipping stout. Give yourself and another (or 3) an afternoon for this one. 838 charactersfatmcb1, Jan 15, 2012
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Black with the smallest amount of brown bubble head when poured. Bit of brown around the edges where the light hits.
Big alcohol in the nose. Chocolate covered cherries, dark chocolate, oak tannin, toffee, and anise.
Wow first sip the alcohol screams at you. Shocks the nose and burns the chest, but damn is it in a good way. After the first couple sips everything starts to settle in though. Sweetness and touch of roast to start. Overall a sweet sticky flavor. Sweetness really coats the palate. Lots of molasses, brown sugar, leather, dark chocolate, bit of oak/caramel, and dark cherries. Low carbonation and the heat sits right in the chest. I often find that big stouts drink like sweet dessert wines. BT has that aspect to it. The port wine like sweetness is there and the overall way BT drinks is with sweetness. 
Black Tuesday is a very interesting and amazing stout. It drinks much like a bourbon/brown liquor blend within a beer. Big alcohol presence that doesn't hide itself or cower away. The alcohol is not masked here, but it doesn't need to be. It's such a good aspect of this beer. Lots of sweet booziness. Of course this beer falls into the hype beer category, but delivers for a reason...it backs itself up in every way.

Poured black with a thin film of dark mocha head. Gigantic, boozy aroma of vanilla, caramel, oak, and licorice.
Moderate carbonation and a full, smooth mouthfeel. Booze comes on strong with lots of toasty caramel, chocolate, vanilla, oak, and a lingering bourbon heat on the finish.
Go big or go home! Great aroma/flavor and, even though the bourbon character is far from subtle, I wouldn't place this at 18% if I didn't know better. Nice treat! 480 charactersgrittybrews, Jan 14, 2012

A Pours a nice black color topped with a mocha head. 
S Very sweet with a ton of chocolate. Almost reminiscent of chocolate syrup. A bit of alcohol comes through as well.
T The taste follows the nose with a very sweet milk chocolate flavor coming through.This is followed by a kick of alcohol. 
M mediumish mouthfeel with a noticeable alcoholic burn. 
Overall this is a great beer but due to the sweetness and the massive abv I wouldn't want more then a glass of it though. Perfect beer to share at a tasting. 552 charactersbeerandcycling88, Jan 09, 2012

A: Pours a dark brown (not as black as I expected) with a small off-brown head that fades to a ring and leaves no lacing.
S: The nose is rich and decadent. There are huge notes of vanilla, chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. The booze comes out big time after it warms.
T: The taste is about the same as the nose with huge flavors of chocolate, bourbon, char, vanilla, molasses, and fudge.
M: The feel is on the fuller side of medium with a long oily finish. Booze is very apparent as it warms. It went flat about halfway through my glass which was kinda disappointing.
O: I thought this would be an all 5 beer but it didn't quite live up to that...it's still damn good. The nose and taste are almost identical to GI BCS which makes it hard to justify $30 for a 750ml when BCS is around $22 a 4pack.

S: Smells sturdy enough but much less robust than anything I had imagined. Sweetness, bourbon barrel warmed cocoa and milk chocolate are foremost. It really does have a wonderful smell despite being lesser than I preconceived and makes me wish I could bath in it. 
T: Definitely a let down for the price, hype, and what I imagined. This beer is definitely not comparable to any other beer but this fresh 2011 bottle is all about sweetness and has a VERY mild barrel presence. Something must be said about the fact that this 18% beer literally tastes and drinks like a 7% beer- obviously very impressive and intriguing.
M: Thin! WTF! It's silky as balls, but come on, rouse me a little, I can take it. You don't have to fuck me this gently. 
O: I didn't put this on much of a pedestal, but I can think of literally dozens of other bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts that are better than this (and all cheaper).

As the session continues, the special-release brew offers a smooth and silky finish. Sticky medium-body with soft carbonation. A very nice and memorable high ABV Russian Imperial Stout.

I have very little to say about this beer, other than to note that it is like nothing else I have tried. It's an RIS turned into dessert wine or port. The mouthfeel is unparalleled, there are huge gobs of coconut, char, and chocolate. It's a perfect sipper, without noticeable heat, which is shocking at its ABV. Given how great it is this young, I can't wait to find out what it tastes like in years to come. 
In thinking about the difference between this and a great RIS like Dark Lord, it strikes me that I would love for someone to figure out how to make a great RIS that was constantly available and very affordable. For Black Tuesday, on the other hand, I can't imagine having it more than once every four months or so, regardless of what it cost. Truly memorable, andI'm glad I had the opportunity. 885 charactersdrgarage, Jan 03, 2012

Dark mahogany colored brew with very little head. Smells like oak and booze. Literally smells as hot as I could imagine a fresh 2011 would be.
Taste: amazingly smooth, dark fruits like a Belgian with a lot of sugar. This is like a fine cognac but its a beer. Delicious! One of the better RIS that I've had in a long time...I'd like more but I'm buzzed off a 1/3 of the 750 haha
Mouthfeel was smooth but with a hint if alcohol. Good accomplishment for an 18% brew I'd say.

3.5 A: Black color. Small head that fell quickly and left no lacing. This is about what I would expect from a beer of this magnitude.
3.5 S: Super boozy a la rubbing alcohol. Strange almost tangy caramel. Moderate roast. Shit tons of molasses. Bourbon booziness is second to rubbing alcohol. Leather and light fruits from the barrels.
2.0 T: This is booze gone wild. Insanely boozy. So much booze. Strange tangy caramel is back in full force with a molasses explosion. Sickeningly sweet - the residual sugar is the only thing that puts the booze in its place. Maple syrup and diabetes. Big bourbon. For as big as this is, there isn't a whole lot going on. Rather, there's just a few flavors that slap your palate silly. If there's subtlety in this, it's well hidden under the booze and sugar.
2.5 M: Super thick, but despite this, its lacking craminess. Hot throughout. Could use more carbonation.
1.5 D: This is a nasty, violent, and disease causing beer. I'm pretty sure I had temporary alcohol poisoning while I felt my beta cells shutting down. If I am still diabetes free, then I guess I won. I finished my glass, but didn't want to and certainly didn't want any more. If I ever want to drink this again, I'll save myself some money and mix equal parts vodka and maple syrup. Beers of this nature can be done with great success. Kuhnhenn's Solar Eclipse presents with the same booziness you'd find in a 7% IPA. WWS is a decent beer that becomes fantastic with age. This is a utter failure of an 18% stout. 1,574 charactersDavoleBomb, Dec 31, 2011

Thought this would be a little more dense and deeper in viscosity but upon pouring things looked this with a faint tan head that fades quickly into a skim topper. Big alcohol i suppose.
Aromas of dark chocolate, burnt caramel, toasted make, light vanilla, black fruits, the soy sauce thing I very rarely get and hate to use as a descriptor but I will here. Black currant, leather, and more rustic earthy aromas.
Wow absolutely amazing complex delicious flavors. Big alcohol burn in the chest and could take some time to open up but just delicious. Sweet melted chocolate fudge, milk chocolate, oak, coconut, toasted vanilla, blackberry, cherry, heavy cream, coffee, milk, leather and asphalt. Mouth is medium but matches what the ABV throws out. Delicious. 764 charactersmcallister, Dec 31, 2011

Overall: Way too boozy. It was funny to have this one next to the 24% abv BD5 in which the alcohol is much more hidden. The opinions about this beer head-2-head with the BD5 differed at the end of the evening, but the majority preferred the BD5 over this one. For me it was not even a fair contest.

It pours black, yep black. A few bubbles break the surface but it's ultimately an inky black beer with no head to speak of. Just a few tan bubbles. The aroma is okay. It's good I suppose. Dark fruits, intense alcohol, not heavy on the bourbon actually. I was expecting the bourbon barrel to dominate the nose but it didn't. 
The flavor is actually a dark fruit bomb. Little roast, the bourbon notes are overshadowed by the figgy, raisin like flavors. Alcohol is evident but not nearly as evident as it could be. Lots of residual sugars create a long, sweet finish. It's not bad. It's not great but it's not bad. Complexity is somewhat lacking. I'd like a little more roasted malt flavor and little more bitterness. It's just incredibly sweet and after 5 or 6 oz can be a little draining on the palate. 
The abv, style, and residual sugars would suggest a lush, thick, mouthfeel.... Yeah, not so much. Incredibly thin for the style. The carbonation is appropriate for the style but the weight on the tongue is lacking. 
Overall, this is a nice beer. Not one of the Bruery's better efforts but a nice enough Imperial Stout. Not worth the price tag or effort to obtain for a Midwest guy with a shallow cellar. 1,272 charactersBrew33, Dec 28, 2011

Poured into snifters. This stout is the Big Bad Wolf. This is the stout the Boogie Monster checks his closet for. Dark as the Larse's soul. Tan almost brown head. We can see that we are in for a real treat. 
Aroma is more potent than a Larse burp. Bourbon at the front. Alcohol, vanilla, molasses, chocolate, prunes. The only thing I rather smell than this beer is Christina Ricci.
We all sat around R Moe Nay's basement scared to even sip this beast. I dared take the first dive. 19.5 percent ABV... I knew this was going to be a bad MF. This is the sam adams utopias of stouts. It took me 10 sips to even have an idea what was going on. All the aromas were present in the taste. None outweighing the other all playing their clearly defined roles. Damn, this IS a tasty stout. BA Yeti, KTG, 09 BT... right there with all the top contenders. 
The mouthfeel is ridiculous. I cannot believe this is 19.5 percent. It tastes around 8 percent. The malts all work together in harmony to make this the most complex rich creamy stout I have ever had.
I had a 2011 Brooklyn black ops after this bad boy courtesy of R Moe Nay... It tasted like poland springs compared to the BT. I seriously thought he emptied the Black ops out and filled it with Guiness. This is one of those once in a lifetime beers that makes memories. Killer. 1,476 charactersDNICE555, Dec 28, 2011

I had a Melange No. 3 last week from this years batch and picking up many of the flavors from Black Tuesday, I was tempted to return to these great flavors.
A: Midnight black in color with no head, no lacing, very watery black looking.
S: Sweet bourbon whiskey , oak barrels , sugar, dark fruit and cherries.
T: Wow is this sweet. I had expected this after having any beer over 16% always tastes extremely sweet. This beer is no exception. It does however taste like the most magnificent Bourbon Barrel aged American Imperial Stout that i have ever had. Sweet bourbon flavors tinged my tongue while the sweetness of the malt kicked in at full strength. There are cotton candy, sweet black cherry flavors, candied plums, among other dark fruit flavors sticking out. Wow, this is sweet... I opened around 55-60 degrees and was glad that I did this vs opening at a refridgerated temp. The bourbon really comes out and stings at the end of every sip along with strong american oak flavors. Delicious
M: Medium in mouthfeel. There is a low but mild level of carbonation as expected and after I let her sit for a minute after opening, a nice frothy top came to the tip of the bottle. 
O: This is definitely my favorite American Imperial stout that I have had to date and I have tried many. A few of these will be cellaring for years to come and I look forward to seeing how they age. The flagship beer from the Bruery has landed. 1,637 charactersalpinebryant, Dec 26, 2011

How could it, really? It incredibly sticky. If left for a while, I would expect this to reduce to a molasses-like sludge.
Smell - Bourbon, sugar, and alcohol. Whoah. I kinda get some of the stout behind it, but really it's overpowered by the bourbon, sugar, and alcohol. When I first smelled it, I got a lot of the barrel. As I drink it, I get less barrel and more alcohol.
Taste - Bourbon at first. Vanilla and caramel. No oak, but the barrel seems evident just from the bourbon and vanilla. Lighter malts shine through much more than any roasted malts. Immensely sweet. In the back I finally get some flavors from the stout itself. Chocolate and some coffee, but it's an afterthought to the sugar and alcohol. The finish isn't as boozy as I expected.
Mouthfeel - Thick and syrupy. Boozy, but not in the taste. It's warming to the point of a slight burn. Split two ways, this is a big ask. I want to go to sleep, but I still have half a glass left and I know I won't feel so hot in the morning.
Overall - Disappointing, I suppose. I don't know what I expected out of such a gigantic stout. It's like the scene at the beginning of Super Troopers where they chug the maple syrup, except there's lethal levels of alcohol in this. Good night. 1,512 charactersAlieniloquium, Dec 25, 2011

A: looks like flat Coke, same consistency too.
S: very mineral, Flintstones vitamins, prunes, soy sauce, maple syrup, very boozy
T: candy sugar, chocolate syrup, cola, raisins, vanilla, bourbon, brandy, red wine marinated mushrooms (especially beef bourguignon), a little bit of savory umami, roasty charcoal finish.
M: medium to thick, alcohol burns on the way down.
O: great, super sweet and boozy, but in all the best ways. The nose was lacking but the taste more than made up for it. Definitely want to let this one warm up. 545 charactersnickhiller, Dec 24, 2011

Pours black, black, black, with a small brown head that doesn't stick around, dat ABV man. Some legs left on the glass. Ominous.
Smell is big but really not as intense as I was expecting. Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, alcohol madness.
Taste is better, probably the definition of a dessert beer. Huge chocolate syrup drenched cake, vanilla, raisin, bourbon, alcohol, table sugar. Really insane flavor but very, very sweet, booze isn't bad but you feel the 18%. A sipper for sure.
Pretty good mouthfeel, hot, low carbonation.
Tasty but the sweetness and alcohol really prohibit this one from true greatness. A few ounces is good for me. 788 charactersChico1985, Dec 20, 2011

In the final they came up with a comparison between Black Damnation IV - Double Black and the Black Tuesday. What a fantastic show down! 
A - A pitch black tar with a thin beige foam that goes for a head.
S - A strong booze smell enters your noose along with the chocolate treat.
T - A very sweet and boozy bourbon delight mixed with some nice chocolate.
M - A medium carbonation that is a bit to much for this kind of beer.
O - A very boozy and sweet beer, all a bit over the top if you ask me. Therefore the Double Black is the overall winner to me, but nevertheless it is an excellent brew. If one would drink this in any other tasting it could easily be an evening winner. It is just that we had some awesome beer that night. If I recollect (I wrote it all down otherwise it would be impossible, haha) it were the following beers:
- Warmer: Chimay Dorée
- A blind test of five beers (chronically ordered): Sint Bernardus 12 (with a lot of yeast), Rochefort 10, Sint Amatus 12, Westvleteren 12 and again the Sint Bernardus 12. I had the last two correct, which I still think is pretty amazing in a totally blind 'sock' test!- (luckily Erik washed his socks!)
- A vertical Surly test - Darkness 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008!
- Boon - old Gueze - this was a side beer brought by me, to test a statement made by Peter Paul from de Molen. He said that a sour gulp in between two strong similar beers rinsinses your tongue. Thats worth a test! 
- Brewery de Fontijn - Vlaamse Reus Blond
- Birrificio Italiano - Cassissona
- Microbrasserie Saint-Hélene - Jean Chris Numero 2
- Deschutes Brewery - Hop In The Dark Cascadian Dark Ale 
- A comparison between Heady Topper (the Alchemist) and Dreadnaught (Three Floyds brewery)
- Boulevard Brewing - Bourbon Barrel Quad (BBQ) {with thanks to Arkansastroy}
- Bierbrouwerij de Boei - Windkracht 10
- And now a horizontal Goose Island comparison - Bourbon County Brand Stout, Rare Bourbon County Stout, Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout and Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout.
- Avery Brewing Company - Rumpkin
- Avery Brewing Company - New World Porter
- Trinity Brewing Company - Brain of the Turtle: Petite Cerise
- Cantillon - Fou' Foune
- The Brewery - Black Tuesday
- De Struise Brouwers - Black Damnation V - Double Black
- And after all this violence Thijs still thought that it was necessary to open a bottle of Firestone Walker Brewing Co. - Parabola - alway a treat though!

Appearance: Pours black with a very mild amount of tan head that disappears quickly.
Smell: Some hot alcohol with dark fruit, roasted barley, and a ton of sweet and dark chocolate. Quite nice.
Taste: Sweet and very smooth, chalked full of warming alcohol that made mellowed from time. Sweet chocolate with dark fruit and some honey as well. 
Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy with tingly carbonation and a slick finish.
Overall: I thought this beer was just wonderful. I love how much it has mellowed since I was first able to try it. I found the 2010 version to be way too hot, and I preferred the 2011 version to the 2010. 2009 is simply sublime. 848 charactersoline73, Dec 19, 2011

A: Pours a one finger head of good cream, good thickness, and bad retention - obviously due to the high ABV. Solid black colour. 
Sm: Raisins, caramel, molasses, restrained dark fruit, grapes, and heavy oak. A moderately strong aroma. 
T: The notes of the nose are all present - oak presiding, with a slightly tart unexpected finish. Rich, well balanced, and brilliantly built. The raisin comes through as well. The tart fruit is quite special in this style. 
Mf: Velvety smooth and wet. A touch too thick, but it complements the flavours perfectly. This is the strong point of the beer. 
Dr: A wonderful sipper, but difficult to drink on account of its high ABV. It's affordable for a small amount at the brewery, but rather unfairly expensive out of the bottle. I'd have it again at a fair price. Really quite nice.
High B+

12.26.16: 2011 vintage at a Christmas tasting.
Aroma of bourbon, fudge, chocolate malt, and dark malts. Rich and dessert-like.
Fudge-like with some hershey's syrupy tones. Chocolate malts and dark malts. Backgrounded bourbon tones. Balanced and enjoyable, with nice depth of flavour. Rich and sweet; definitely a dessert stout.

Black Tuesday definitely lives up to its name. It’s pitch black in color. No light cuts through at all. It’s topped with a darker, mocha colored head. It rises just above the surface, but falls quickly. Perhaps the high abv got to it. Lacing was definitely on the lighter side. Good looking stuff.
The nose is fantastic. It’s full of chocolate and roasted m alt scents. It smells sweet and sugary. There’s definitely a mix of sweet milk chocolate and bittersweet dark notes. Bourbon is definitely notable, but seems only moderately strong. That’s my ideal approach. It complements the malty notes extremely well. Secondary scents of oak, vanilla, molasses, and brown sugar. Alcohol is surprisingly mild given that it’s 19.5%. Wow. 
The flavor is just as impressive. It’s all kinds of malty and sweet. The chocolate flavors are sweet and bittersweet. Roasted malts buttress the chocolate flavors and add nice depth. Bourbon definitely has a moderate presence and plays that role perfectly. Barrel-aging imparted really nice vanilla and oak flavors. Brown sugar and molasses emerge late. It seems to grow sweeter with each passing sip. There is a slight dark fruit tanginess on the tail. Alcohol is definitely there in flavor. It’s also quite warm. No big shock given the size. Finishes sweet and chocolaty with a kiss of bourbon. Excellent.
Black Tuesday has a medium to full body. It is nice and smooth. Carbonation is light and the bubbles feel soft. It’s good, but it could use just a little more body. I really was anticipating a thick, viscous beast. It’s not quite there. Having said all that, it goes down relatively easy for a beer of its size. It is big and the alcohol is definitely there though. 
Black Tuesday is the best beer I’ve tried from the Bruery. I expected that. It is excellent beer. It’s packed with tons of flavor. The bourbon flavor is excellent and works its magic extremely well. My only two small complaints are that it’s a bit too sweet and the alcohol is a bit much. I suspect it’s integrated some over two years, but perhaps not that much. I didn’t try it fresh. It’s definitely excellent beer nonetheless. Well worth seeking out. 2,210 charactersprototypic, Dec 18, 2011

A: A very dark brown, but not black like some stouts I've seen. No head or lacing, and frankly doesn't look that thick. 
S: Lots of delicious sweetness. Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, molasses, and not that much booze.
T: Oh man, this is terrific. Starts off with some sugary dark fruit and molasses. In the middle I get chocolate and a bit of vanilla. The finish comes in with more molasses and a bit of roastiness, both of which linger for several seconds after I've swallowed. Again, really not that much heat at all. 
M: Thick and quite appropriate for this beast of a beer. A bit of carbonation to keep it from being too heavy, but it's gentle enough to allow the beer to lay down heavily in the mouth.
O: Yeah, this beer is awesome. Not worth more than the $33 I paid for it, but not worth less either. Lots of delicious, rich flavors, and very sweet. Black Tuesday joins the Dark Lord at the top of my favorite stouts list. 1,127 charactersWorldWideStout, Dec 11, 2011

Poured from 750ml bottle into red wine glass.
Aroma: Vinous grape, coconut, chocolate syrup, and soft bourbon aroma warms the sinuses. One can immediately tell that this one's going to be a delicious sipper.
Appearance: Light tan head with (not surprisingly) minimal retention. Dark black body in the center, which transitions to cola brown around the edges. After each sip, the thickest legs I've seen from a beer drip down the inside of the glass!
Flavor: Coconut, sweet dark rum, dark caramel, toasted marshmallow, bourbon, black cherry, and raisin on the finish. In general, there is quite a bit of sweetness to this beer (the perception of which is enhanced by the extremely high ABV).
Mouthfeel: Body is admittedly thinner than anticipated. This one comes across almost as a fortified wine or liquer, albeit with medium-low carbonation. The alcohol in this one is very warm, but not harsh.
Overall: I can definitely see why this one is so sought-after. EXTREMELY well-done!!! The bottle label says it can be cellared for "decades", which did not surprise any of us. At 18%+ ABV, it's far from being a session beer. If you can get a bottle, though, I'd recommend splitting it among 3 or more friends as cosmonick did. You'll be the toast of the tasting! 1,362 charactersmdvatab, Dec 04, 2011

Deep black pour, very viscous, coats the glass impressively.
Far and away one of the richest smelling beers I've encountered. While I find that CBS offers more of a variety of scents (with the maple, bourbon, vanilla mixing) Black Tuesday just leaves this focused chocolately, boozy wonderfulness on the nose.
Tastes even better than it gives off in the nose which in and of itself is magnificent accomplishment.
Truly worthy of all the hype out there,what a flagship for Bruery products, I'll be trying a lot more of their stuff going forward. 
Something every true fan of good beer must try at least once! 689 charactersAdamostella, Nov 30, 2011

S- Fucking Amazing. Ridiculous amounts of chocolate, malt, vanilla, sugar, oak, alcohol. Simply decadent. 
T- Blown away. Mirrors the nose but somehow even more complex. The sweetness is balanced, massive amounts of chocolate, pretty roasty, oak and vanilla and nice amount of heat. COMPLEX.

Beer pours pitch black with some dark browns at the edges when held up to the light. Minimal chocolate brown head, less than half a finger dissipating to a string of bubbles along the collar. Plenty of alcohol legs and light lacing from the thin collar of a bubble. I can swirl up a half a finger of head, so there should be some carbonation left, which is impressive for such a big beer.
Nose is intense, boozy dark fruits, raisin, cherry, prune, dark chocolate, espresso, dark roasted malt. As it warms up, more of the barrel comes through, vanilla, toasted coconut, burnt oak. 
Taking a sip, dark fruits still shine through, chocolate covered raisins and prunes, some dark cherry. Middle of the tongue is roasted espresso and malts, toasty but not burnt, big vanilla, and coconut. Not much of the oak flavor on the tongue. Finish is sweet, lots of dark fruit and chocolate lingering with a little heat going down. 
Medium to full body, light carbonation that is very soft, slick and oily on the tongue. For a 18+% beer, the alcohol is relatively well hidden, with some booziness on the nose and some warmth going down. A very good beer. 1,237 charactersnataku00, Nov 29, 2011

Black Tuesday is a true blessing handed down to the lovers of strong ales.
It drops into the glass, a dark mahogany, If you give it a swirl, you'll see the liquid leaves a slight kiss of what looks like cocoa butter on the side of the glass before it rejoins the drink.
The nose is beautiful. Your first inhale gives you a hint of what is to come. Now inspired, you give it another, deeper sniff. Hints of chocolate, maybe toffee, bourbon, and...Black Tuesday is so complex, you can continue smelling but...
I have yet to taste another liquid that I have enjoyed more than Black Tuesday. My first time was an epiphany. And now 2 years later I long for it for months waiting for its release. It has a warming delivery of chocolate, bourbon, at times i get a hint of toffee--maybe caramel. It is a truly beautiful drink. 
Cheers to the folks at the Bruery! 1,110 characters2beerdogs, Nov 28, 2011

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle '11 vintage. 
A: Black with very little head. Big alcohol legs, practically no lacing.
S: Oh boy. Huge and intense nose. Barrel (bourbon, vanilla, oak) deep dark chocolate, alcohol soaked dark fruits, toffee/molasses. Surprisingly doesn't smell all that boozy. Probably the best smelling barrel aged beer and it's fresh!
T: Follows the nose nicely. Rich barrel with a bit of bourbon and plenty of vanilla and oak. Lots of chocolate, rum soaked fruits. Very sweet, lots of nougat, some licorice. Vinous notes on the finish. Extremely balanced. There's a little alcohol burn up front and again on the back of the throat as it goes down, but no where near what 18.3% is supposed to feel like. 
M: Close to a full body, extremely smooth, light carbonation. Not quite as thick and creamy as some big stouts, but it's about as smooth and rich as a it gets at 18%.
O: Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. I was shocked how balanced and almost mellow this beer was fresh at over 18%. So much complexity and richness without ever being cloyingly sweet. This is going to be a perpetual top want of mine. It lives up to the hype. 1,143 charactersSatchboogie, Nov 27, 2011
4.21/5  rDev -5.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Review #100. Took me longer to get here than it should've, but I can honestly say that I didn't expect to try Black Tuesday within my first 100 reviews. So for that, I feel pretty lucky. I've had this twice now, first on-tap at Bruery Provisions on November 7th, 2011, and second from a bomber on November 22nd, 2011. Both 2011 vintages. 
This review will be for the on-tap 2 oz. sample, served in a wine taster.
A - Well, it's not as oily as CC offerings, but it is as thick as I expected. Truly black and utterly still. Literally no carbonation, head, or retention atop the body. Lacing amounts to minimal bubbles mixed with a light brown film across the face of the glass. 
S - Predominantly bourbon oak barrel, and a really damn good-smelling one at that. Underneath, it's difficult to pick out everything. What I can name includes vanilla bean, decadent dark chocolate and cocoa, light caramel, a sort of nutty character, roasted cashews and almonds, light spices, and the faintest touch of alcohol. 
T - This is the absolute best-tasting stout I've had. Immense creamy milk chocolate at the front. Mid-palate is comprised of bourbon, oak, insanely-robust vanilla, stronger caramel, toffee, and roasted notes. This is massive and perfectly-integrated. This goes beyond a 5.0. 
M - Heavy body with a soft and creamy feel. The finish is lightly-bitter, almost tannic, and lingers with a roasted/bourbon/wood quality. Alcohol reveals itself as throat-warming. 
D - Black Tuesday tastes amazing. The nose isn't quite on the same level with a bit too much bourbon to find that pinpoint balance with all of the other characters. Otherwise, it's as well-crafted and complex as anything I can think of. 
Primary difference between on-tap and bottling - a bit more carbonation in the bottle, with actual visible head. Smell and taste were virtually identical with what I recall on-tap.
Edit - 2012 revisit. The malts got carried away in the newest vintage and it's just too sweet. Docking slightly for consistency because this vintage really isn't that great. 2,063 charactersAuracom, Nov 27, 2011

a - opened the bottle and had my pour in a bruery snifter. poured a sludgy black and the head could be built on command. the color was interesting...kind of white, almost grey.
s - smell is phenomenal. vanilla, chocolate...really rich.
t - Whoa. Blew my mind right out of my head. Rich and thick. Licorice. Chocolate. Intensity. Sweet, but not darklord sweet.
m - amazingly thin (for what it is) and really really drinkable. pretty light for how heavy it is.
o - overall the treats keep on coming and this was certainly not a let down. that being said, i am a bit surprised with all the hubbub about this beer when there are MANY as good or better beers out there that are not nearly as hard to get ahold of. not a disappointment by any means (as i loved it), but i guess i had a bit higher expectations. 931 characterscosmicevan, Nov 25, 2011

Appears like night fudge. Little to know head. 
Smells like gasoline, lightning, and blackouts. Holy moly 
that's a high abv!
Tastes like deep anise and prunes and fig. 
Mouthfeel is very heavy duty. It almost has a port like exit. 
Overall an amazing beer. I really enjoyed this and would love to have it again. 403 charactersYagman3000, Nov 24, 2011

A- Pours a thick dark brown, not black motor oil ish as much as a dark brown thick bourbon. thin head reduces to a thin ring that sticks around for a long time, looks murky and menacing. Thin bubbles rise to the top like swamp water. 
S- holy rich bourbon. Loads of booze and vanilla, with definite spiciness as well. Loads of oak, a bourbon blanket over rich notes of maltiness and chocolate. a little coffee as it warms up, definitely a great smelling stout under barrel.
T- Bourbon fills the mouth and the nostrils, so much sweet vanilla and chocolate. the stout really comes out as it warms, too. the bourbon is forward and warming, but smooth and not too hot. dark fruits drenched in bourbon (like those bourbon filled chocolate candies, maybe osme kind of chocolate bourbon date?). This definitely has the potential to be better with age, but is phenomenal now, some complex cinnamon and dessert favor. so good.
M- Not going to lie, this thing is warm. not a biting hot, though, a once-you-swallw-your-throat-warms-up heat that is actually quite awesome. this beer is also much thicker than it poured, ans surprisingly smooth for the alcohol. 
O- incredible. The crazy thing is, I think it will actually get BETTER with age, this really is a masterpiece. Probably my favorite beer. 1,463 charactersridglens, Nov 23, 2011

4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750ml poured into a tulip. Split with russwbeck and tasted side-by-side with Chocolate Rain. Epic.
A - Living up to its name, Black Tuesday is black. Shiny, glossy, foreboding black. A surprising amount of carbonation and bubbles can be seen slowly rising up the sides of the glass, continuously feeding and resupplying the tan head, which peaks at around a finger in height but slowly receding to about a half-finger cap that lasts forever. It is surprisingly noticeably darker than Chocolate Rain, which takes on a ruddy brown color in comparison.
S - In comparison to Chocolate Rain and going back and forth, Black Tuesday actually comes across as significantly less bold and in your face. The chocolate and roast are still key components here, though the chocolate is less sweet, but with the less ostentatious aroma comes a little bit more mellow aroma in terms of anise and alcohol. It's hard to say which one is actually 'better' as they are two different beasts.
T - The minute this liquid hits my lips, it's memorable. This instantly rockets to the top of my list of sweetest stouts, fighting neck and neck with Three Floyds' Dark Lord. I don't really get as much bourbon as I thought I would in the front, but there is some in the finish and underneath everything. A little bit of char and liquid smoke, and exceptionally malty. Slight bits of anise, and a surprising amount of dark fruits to add to it. Like sugar-coated, alcohol-soaked fruit. To wrap everything up is a warming alcohol that is always on the mind, but not constantly nagging with its astringency. 
M - Mouthfeel is heavy-bodied with decent carbonation. Thick and offensively bold, Black Tuesday invades the palate and infests it with a syrupy feel that weighs heavily on the palate. 
D/O - Drinkability is moderate. The sweetness and alcohol heat keeps it from being on par with Chocolate Rain, but it is still very much up there in terms of imperial stouts. Probably doesn't come across as much as the ABV would suggest, but it is noticeable. Although I am drinking half a bottle of this and half a bottle of Chocolate Rain side-by-side, I couldn't imagine drinking a whole bottle of this alone, but Chocolate Rain would probably be feasible. 2,226 charactersnhindian, Nov 22, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Shared side by side with Chocolate Rain with nhindian
A: Thick black pour with a small light brown head. Hardly any retention and spotty lacing, but a nice amount of bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Significantly darker in color than Chocolate Rain, and a better head. BT gets the nod in terms of appearance.
S: The smell is a bit more subdued, but seemingly more balanced than Chocolate Rain. Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and booze much like CR are the focus of the beer, but when comparing the smell of this is much smaller.The booze isn't as offensive, and it is not quite as sweet, but the other smells are also not as big. I can't quite tell which I prefer. Going to call this one a push.
T: The first taste certainly merits the WOW factor. A ton of booze, molasses, licorice, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, smokey charred malts, and other flavors I'm not quite sure my palate was ready for. As the booze fades on the backend, I'm getting some very dark fruits developing as well. I completely understand why this beer is so highly regarded, but I must say I was expecting a bit more balance and less booze and licorice. Not nearly as much bourbon as I was expecting, but the other flavors certainly make up for it. However, I cannot honestly say this is the best stout I've ever had. The flavors do develop very well on the palate. Chocolate, molasses, and licorice up front. Bourbon, vanilla, and booze in the middle. Booze, roasted malts, and a dry finish combine with that typical warming alcohol feeling.
MF: Not quite as thick as I was expecting. I mean don't get me wrong, this beer has a heavy body and is carbonated well. However, it is not syrupy or creamy like other big stouts. A pretty good body considering the size of the beer.
O: The drinkability is a bit tough on this one. In the end, it is very sweet and very boozy. Half a bottle was honestly a bit much to put down. With that said, it was phenomenally tasty and I was very happy to have tried it. I just was expecting a bit higher drinkability. Very good overall. 2,052 charactersrusswbeck, Nov 22, 2011

750ml capped and waxed bottle, 2011 vintage.
pours out pretty much opaque black, but a bit of brown is noticable on the edges. a nice creamy, dark mocha head that lasted the whole way, bit of legs and lace. i maybe was expecting motor oil considering the abv, but this wasnt at all.
big alcohol in the nose, starts off kind of smooth like a bourbon, but as this warms its almost all solvent booze. also lots of sweet maple syrup, dark fruits, raisons, burnt sugars.
intensely sweet, but i love it! burnt sugar, maple syrup, dark fruits, and a bit of roasted malt are what i pick up the most. the alcohol is definatly there, not really bourbony however, but compared to the aroma, its definatly more subdued.
big huge, syrupy, sticky, sweet mouthfeel. quite sugary in a way, high final gravity im assuming. carbonation feel right.
overall, this was definatly one of the better stouts ive had, different than most. this one focuses more on the maple, sweet, sugary flavors where most focus on the roast. the alcohol may hurt this beer a little, mainly the aroma, but that could age out nicely. cant wait to try chocolate rain!!!! 1,192 charactersdogfishandi, Nov 19, 2011

I was really disappointed by how sweet and cloying this stout was. I've had the 2010 before (which I thought was a soy sauce bomb) so I wasn't expecting much from the '11 but, it didn't even meet my lowered expectations. Really, how does this beer have an A on BA? It's like the Bruery chaptalized the hell out of what may have been a very good base stout. I realize the residual sugar has to be high for a stout with 18% abv but, this was really over done. I think I need to go to the dentist... 544 charactersWkndatBernardus, Nov 18, 2011

Pours a very viscous dark brown color with a surpirsingly sturdy small tan head that receded very slowly leaving quality lacing on the glass.
Aromas begin with super high cacoa dark chocolate, and bourbon induced vanilla and oak. Then you get some solid dark fruits and hints of brown sugar sweetness which emerge more and more as it warms.
The tastes follow the nose with huge rich dark chocolate, lesser baker's milk chocolate, huge vanilla and lesser bourbon/oak tannic flavors. Tons of chocolate, dark fruits and brown sugar and caramelized malts emerge more and more as it warms. 
The mouthfeel is quite full bodied with moderate carbonation. For begin so huge of the beer the 3 years of age have allowed the sweetness to mellow and the Belgian yeast to dry out the finish slightly. Make no mistake this is still a sweet beer but no where near as sweet as a fresh bottle would be. 
Overall, this is truely a tribute to American brewing. Taking a Port-leveled ABV beer with such a sweet, dark malt base and creating a drinkable offering using Belgian yeast is truely amazing. A must try for any true beer geek. 1,208 charactersclaspada, Nov 14, 2011

The alcohol presence was surprisingly subdued for such a big brew.

Big alcohol burn on sides of mouth. A burnt sugar flavor hits me mid-mouth. Big roasty finish makes for a good out. The alcohol fire lingers.
I'd prefer this aged for at least a year to take out some of the sweetness. 376 characterssweethome, Nov 12, 2011

A: Blacker than a voodoo midnight with a light tan head that fell quickly away.
S: Nice sweet bourbon and strong port-like notes. Chocolate syrup moves in there, too.
T: This is a very sweet beverage. I find lots of chocolate brownies or syrup, a touch of soy here and there, and slight caramel notes. The bourbon is kind of hard to find amidst everything else that is going on. The heat is pretty high at this point and finishes into strong notes of port. 
M: The mouthfeel was touch disappointing, but with the high alcohol I should not be surprised. There is a lingering sweetness that transcends taste and is strongly reminiscent of port.
O: I am happy to try this one, but I don't really want more than a 6 oz serving. I think that this is fine piece of work, however it is not really my bag. 844 characterseyeenjoybeer, Nov 08, 2011

Look: Black and totally opaque with a brown ring on top. No real head but definitely not expected
Smell: Wow the nose is great. Lots of chocolate and dark malts there is just a slight hint of alcohol and @ 18.3% that is quite impressive
Taste: This might be one of the best tasting beers I have ever had. The beer has the right amount of bourbon and a great dark chocolate sweetness and a great vanilla backbone. Exceptional flavor. There is absolutely no noticeable alcohol very impressed
Mouthfeel: Near perfect full body but I thought it would be a bit thicker on the palate and low carbonation
Overall: This is hands down one of the best barrel aged big stout if not the best one on the market. I had my reservations that at $30 a bottle this one would not be worth it but damn was I wrong. Almost perfect 834 charactersDarthKostrizer, Nov 01, 2011

A: Jet black, no head, but nice lacing. Can't see through it, can't see carbonation.
S: Wowza. First off boozy. The high alcohol content is evident, with a brandy sort of smell. Vanilla, some fruitiness to it.
T: Boozy again, but that's to be expected. Very wine or brandy like. Hits hard with the boozy punch, but settled back with a smooth fruity and vanilla aftertaste.
M: Full bodied. Consistent. 
O: Not my type of beer, but I can see why it is so popular. 532 charactersMurrhey, Oct 30, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My first re-review of a beer but I wanted to make a record for the 2011 batch and see what having a multitude of good beers between tasting the 2 batches did for my perception. In addition I wanted to review it based on a full pint (18.3% ABV, yeah I'm taking one for the team)
Appearance: Very dark brown with 3/4" inch of dark brown head, which dissipated fairly quickly. Considerable legs on this one. 
Smell: Bourbon, raisins, brown sugar, vanilla, mild tobacco, and a faint coffee/roasted malt aroma. BT continues to set the bar for me as far as aroma goes. 
Taste: Bourbon, raisins, vanilla, brown sugar with the coffee/roast malts appearing in the finish taste. I had one of my 2010 BTs about a month ago and I agree with BAs who feel the 2011 is not as hot. There is a price, the 2011 version is even sweeter than the 2010, which may turn some people off. The good thing is the roast/ coffee notes come in at the end and help keep the sweetness from becoming cloying.
Mouth-feel: Full bodied, definitely more body than the 2010 version with a fairly low-level of carbonation appropriate for the style. No beer with an ABV of 18.3% should have the alcohol as well-hidden as this beer. Just like the car mirrors with the warning, "objects are closer than they appear", this one should have a warning, "this beer is stronger than it appears". Well done Bruery.
Overall: BT continues to set the standard for nose as far as I'm concerned, continues to present a very complex tasty palate, and continues to be sweet with a roasted malt finish that keeps it from being too sweet. The sweetness will be too much for some, but any brewery who can brew a high gravity monster with a great nose,a tasty, unique palate, and make it absurdly drinkable for the ABV is alright with me. I'd like to compare the 2010 and the 2011 in a year or so to see how the heat from the 2010 fares and how the sweetness in the 2011 comes through. 1,930 charactersIKR, Oct 29, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Celebratory last beer in CA.
A- Pours out of the bottle like a sludge of viscous oil. A dark mocha head forms to about a half centimeter and falls to a creamy ring around the glass. Sticky legs and only a few lace spots.
S- Starts out as a fudge, cocoa forward massive stout with big dark raisins and subdued bourbon. Warmth allows the oak, whiskey and vanilla to come out. When warm it is amazing bourbon brownie dessert greatness.
T- Just like the aroma but one major difference, sweetness really comes out. The great cocoa, fudge, truffle, whiskey, raisin fruit, vanilla profile is brought down somewhat by a big sweet table sugar presence. Don't get me wrong, it is good but would be phenomenal if this wasnt the case.
MF- Oily, super thick (most ever) body with a surprisingly creamy and slick oily body. Not as warm as I expected, just a nice alcohol compliment.
A true dessert beer. The sweetness (surprised more reviews don't mention it) is the only thing that keeps this from being spectacular. It is also the first time a beer really made me feel more drunk, sip by sip. Very well hidden alcohol, would take some alcohol flavor for a cut in sweetness though. 1,173 characterscbutova, Oct 28, 2011

Pours very dark coffee brown, some small bubbles but basically no head. Smell is well integrated bourbon and chocolate, big aroma of dark cocoa powder, some vanilla bean, cola and mocha. Really good stuff. Taste is pretty dry bourbon, mocha/chocolate syrup, some cola, moderate alcohol (but I guess not bad given the ABV), finishing again with a hefty dose of cocoa and also a light espresso bitterness. Very light carbonation and kind of thin/Coca Cola-like body. There's a moderate amount of alcohol burn which kind of overwhelms the light body. Overall, this is a big stout with nicely integrated flavors, improved by the barrel, but lacks body and is a little hot. Still, at 18% this is drinkable enough--surely a miracle of nature.
Between this, Chocolate Rain, and S'More Tuesday, this was my least favorite. 883 characterspmarlowe, Oct 26, 2011

Pours a dark black with a small light brown head that disappears pretty quickly. No lacing, which isn't surprising given the ABV. It does leave some legs on the glass when swirled. Aroma is big fudge brownie, vanilla, bourbon, and certainly quite a bit of alcohol as well. The taste is quite sweet with a lot of fudge brownie. A bit of vanilla, some caramel, and lots of bourbon as well as a bit of oak. Warming alcohol is noticeable on the finish. There's a light astringency as well. Full bodied. Manages to be very sweet without being syrupy. Low carbonation. Very good beer. I'm glad to have tried it, but it is not something I could drink a lot of. 730 charactersjethrodium, Oct 17, 2011
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml bottle poured into Weyerbacher tulip.
A: Pours an inky black with reddish brown edges that create a mirror effect in the glass. All i see is myself reflected back. Thin covering of off white head after a vigorous pour. After I uncapped it, it proceeded to bubble for about 2 minutes. Catching your eye before even being poured.
S: Dark fruits with a mix of bakers chocolate. A roasted malt aroma dances with the essence of the barrel. First sniffs were a bit boozy, but once the nose overcomes the burn of the alcohol, it is greeted with that complex blend of aromas. Truly enticing. 
T: Roasted malt & chocolate followed by a dark fruit sweetness. A woody, bourbon flavor is balanced throughout. It makes itself apparent after you breath in after a sip. A tad sweet, but just as interesting as the nose.
M: Leaves a silky feel, with a bourbon barrel presence that lingers. The sweetness makes it sticky. Thick & syrupy, but not overbearing. A great balanced is achieved here while highlighting key aspects that any great bourbon barrel aged stout achieves.
O: Simply wow! I don't believe in hype, but i can see what the clamor is about over this one. It is a bit sweet & boozy, but that seems to be the hallmark here. The way all the flavors are weaved in is simply mouthwatering. Quite an impressive brew. Older vintages must be drinking amazing. 1,360 charactersCisco619, Oct 14, 2011

*From notes
Vintage 2010
-- A BIG thanks to baycat for hookin' me up with this one. Cheers, Ryan! --
A: It's not called "Black Tuesday" for nothing. This monster is as dark as the pits of hell. A good, generous pour yields a 1.25 finger head with minimal lacing.
S: Just fantastic. It's boozy, yet there's a focused concentration of dark chocolate malt and toasted tannin. One of the better bouquets I've had the pleasure of encountering.
T: Now I get it. The density of flavor here is unmatched. It packs such an immense amount of wow per ounce - I'm astounded. I found it to be like liquid brownie batter, which is a really, really good thing. Is the 18% ABV detectable? Absolutely, yet it's so well integrated that I have a hard time complaining about it. This is a delicious beer.
M: Not as viscous as I'd expected, yet it doesn't hold the brew back in any way. It's soft and silky, yet the carbonation adds a wonderful layer of texture that enhances the flavor profile of the beer.
O: I didn't want to like The Bruery's Black Tuesday. Really, I went into this assuming I'd be drinking the most overrated ADIS on the planet. Yet from the moment the bouquet hit my nose and the heavenly liquid entered my mouth, it was over. I must concede that yes, this is a top notch Imperial Stout, and worthy of it's many accolades. There isn't a single facet of the beer that I can harshly critique. It's God damn delicious.
To put it simply: this is a masterpiece. 1,548 charactersRhettroactive, Oct 13, 2011

A - Deep and dark almost pitch black, the slightest of brown highlights when held to the light. A thin cappucinno head that disappears immediately and leaves swirling lines of bubbles on the surface and a thin collar around the edge of the glass.
S - Smells of licorice, dark caramel, malt extract, port wine, medium/dark (50% cacao) chocolate, bourbony, a hint of vanilla. 
T - A liquid truffle. Sweet, chocolately, smooth bourbon touched, caramel, touch of vanilla, molasses, sugar, brown sugar,. Really complex flavors - great!
M - Thick, syrupy...low carbonation. Sugary sweetness coats the entire mouth. Really good.
Warmth from the bourbon, malty, sugary sweetness - this all just works.
D - Unbelievably drinkable...19.5%, really? Drinks like a much lower alcohol beer. This is unbelievably good stuff. Thinking about cracking a second bottle, but don't think the trading partners who already have this reserved would appreciate that. 1,032 charactersallyourbeers, Oct 07, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 bottle into a Duvel tulip. Much thanks to mashmaster for this longtime want.
It is indeed black, impossibly black. Like motor oil from a jug, this pours very slowly out of the bottle. A quarter-finger medium-dark brown head forms and sticks around for a while. Some lacing around the glass, but it quickly subsides. Legs all over the place.
The aroma is exquisite - this is easily the most complex beer I've ever smelled. I hate to recapitulate a BA cliché, but it applies in this case: I can’t get my nose out of the glass. Huge hits of raisins, prunes, and other dark fruits, like a freshly baked pudding. Dark baker's chocolate and fudge. Plenty of alcohol in the mix as well, with the unmistakable aroma of bourbon. So much sweet vanilla from the barrel, with remarkably little of that nostril hair-burning element that many big stouts have. 
The taste is enormous. Tremendous sweetness, but that huge barrel presence tempers it perfectly. There's so much going on with this beer, but nothing seems muddled - each flavor is incredibly pure. Sweet dark fudge with vanilla extract added. Blackstrap molasses and caramel. There's an anise cookie-like flavor at work that really reminds me of biscotti. The back end is all smooth, smooth bourbon, but the booze is not close to being overpowering. Just a hint of bitterness in the finish. 
Thick, viscous, sludgy mouthfeel, but there's a hint of carbonation. The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect, and befits the enormity of this beer.
The hype behind this beer is definitely merited. With so many competing flavors at work, this beer could have easily been a muddled mess. Instead, it borders on perfection like no stout I've tried before. I shudder to think what the 2009 version tastes like today, though this one is drinking pretty perfectly right now. Worth every penny. 1,835 charactersamphion1065, Oct 02, 2011

4.66/5  rDev +4.3%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750 mL bottle of the 2010 vintage. It was allowed to warm a little bit, and was split between my Duvel tulip (first half) and Southampton snifter (second half). 
Black Tuesday pours just like the name suggests. It might have been my imagination, but I'd swear the lights actually flickered when I cracked the bottle. The dark caramel head drew itself up to about three fingers in height, before fading away somewhat quickly, and not leaving anything in the way of lacing. I starting picking up the nose a little bit when I popped the cap and poured, but when I first leaned into the glass my nose got absolutely blasted. This thing smells rich beyond belief. It's the aroma of a decadent chocolate cake that had some bourbon added into the batter. It's pungent, and it smells great, but if there was a little bit more complexity it would be perfect. Ask and ye shall receive, because Black Tuesday absolutely crushes it flavor wise. That bombastic bourbon chocolate cake is still by far the centerpiece, but it's supplemented by sensations of dark fruit and molasses. There's a slight warming from the alcohol, but it's pleasant, and nowhere near how intense it should be for a beer its size (even after a year). The body is impossibly rich and creamy, and the carbonation is perfectly dialed in to prevent the beer from becominy syrupy, while maintaining its malt forward nature. I wouldn't change a thing. Holy hell does Black Tuesday live up to the hype. I grabbed two bottles last year, and cracked this one to see if it was worth trying to get more bottles going forward. The answer is a resounding yes! 1,609 charactersaxeman9182, Sep 30, 2011

From a 750ml bottle into a 6oz sinfter
Vintage 2010 (18.2%) 
Vintage 2009 (19.5%) 
Note: Review for the 2010 with the 2009 as comparison. 
APPEARANCE: Gushed upon opening, but poured out and settled just fine. A dark brown pour yields a medium, foamy looking tan head with decent retention. Head fades down to a ring with touches of wisp on top. Black body, opaque, with medium carbonation evident. Only a ring remains but leaves no real lacing down the glass. Nothing special about the ’10. However, the ’09 was much more impressive, with a darker, thicker pour and a more persistent mocha colored head that left some nice lacing down the glass.
SMELL: Lots of bourbon on the nose for sure. Oak and vanilla, with some sweet milk chocolate and quite a bit of booze. Faint notes of roasted malts and pure chocolate try to make their way through, but this one is very bourbon barrel heavy, which is probably the point. Definitely good for what it is, though I’d appreciate a touch more base beer on the nose for top marks. The ’09 delivered the goods in that department, however, with less booze and more stout, showing a better union between the base beer and the barrel. Really nice.
TASTE: Roasted flavors start it off before an avalanche of barrel and alcohol. Lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla and milk chocolate up front. Very boozy through the middle; the 18.2% is there in all its glory. Finish is quite nice, with some dark chocolate, cream notes, and dark cherries even, which compliment the bold barrel flavors. Aftertaste is big and menacing, with an overdose of bourbon, oak, some dark chocolate, and lots of heat. Lots of wonderful flavors for sure, but the heat needs to mellow out. Enter the 2009 vintage. This was insane. Way smoother than the 2010, with less booze and heat, but more roasted and chocolaty base beer in the mix. The base stout meshed superbly with the bourbon barrel, leaving us with an excellently balanced and absolutely decadent brew. Much less boozy, and way smoother and much more complex. The ’09 was simply as good as it gets. 
PALATE: Fuller body and quite heavy and thick on the palate, with medium carbonation. Very viscious, and much thicker than we’d expected after it foamed out upon opening. Creamy enough on the palate, goes down fine with a lot of heat on the swallow and finishes quite sticky. Despite the heat, the thick, heavy body is what I love in this style. The ’09 was much the same, but not quite as heavy on the palate. 
OVERALL: This was one of the most enjoyable and interesting beer experiences so far. Besides the fun company, this was an unbelievable pair of beers. I must admit that I was sceptical before opening this stuff, as this one gets far too much press, but the praise and love for this beer is more than deserved. The 2010 has piles of wonderful flavor and a obliterating feel that ranks up there with the thickest and meanest of them. The bourbon barrel is delicious and the base beer is still strong enough to hold its own. The heat needs to mellow out, that’s for sure, but given some time, perhaps that will take care of itself. 
As a comparison, the 2009 was everything I hoped it would be. Easily an A+ beer. The flavors of the base beer were allowed to come forth and play a better supporting role for the beautiful bourbon barrel, which resulted in an absolutely decadent brew. Massive and superbly balanced nose and palate, with a great look to boot, this might be my favorite American brewed bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. With some time, I can only hope the 2010 vintage will smoothen out like this, and hopefully future vintages will follow suit. I will constantly be on the lookout for this brew. Thanks to everyone for a great time, and another huge cheers to those who made this evening possible. 4,234 charactersJeffo, Sep 21, 2011

S: Hot, definatley smell the booze, coffee, and chocolate. Heavy on the alcohol.
T: Sweet (a little to sweet for my taste) and very hot! Alcohol is really heavy although not as bad as I expected.
M: Thick, heavy, sticky.
O: I was really amped to try this one and I wasn't sure what to really expect. Overall it was solid, but I am glad I didnt trade away my cellar or drop $40 on a bottle. I think I will stick to RIS's around 10% ABV. Just a little to heavy on the alcohol for me.

4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally! 2010 vintage reviewed courtesy of David. Glad to try some of this, now I can sit on my 2009 longer ;) Poured into a Cigar City Snifter.
Poured an absolute pitch black with a slight ring of mocha head that recedes to a slight haze. Ominous. Nose is fantastic, just huge aromas of dark, sweet malt, chocolate, and molasses with insane Bourbon characteristics of oak, vanilla, and caramel. Taste follows the nose in the best possible way, nothing but darkest malt, molasses, chocolate and Bourbon. So smooth and complex. Mouthfeel is expectedly syrupy and viscous, with a full body and low carbonation. Bit of pleasant chest-fire from the +18% ABV, but I sure don't mind! Overall a mind-blowingly insane beer, so excited to finally experience this beast! 761 charactersjsanford, Sep 04, 2011

A: Pours a dark brown, not black as the name seems to imply with no head or lacing left around glass, which is to be expected for a beer this big.
S: Lots of alcohol which is hard to get past. Hints of toffee, chocolate and bourbon are detectable behind all of the alcohol.
T: Lots of roasted malt with toffee and chocolate notes with oak, vanilla and some coconut from the bourbon barrels. Lots of alcohol.
M: Very full body, low to moderate carbonation and finishes very sweet.
O: Very unique brew, too much alcohol in the nose takes away from the experience but tastes quite good, especially as it warms up. Nice warming after each sip.. 710 charactersAzurescens, Sep 01, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 Vintage
Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle.
A - Pours a thicker black liquid with a no light coming through it. The pour generates a 0.5 inch dense head that is dark tan colored. It recedes at a quicker pace down to a thin ring around the glass. 
S - The aroma could be perceived as soon as it was poured with tons of bourbon notes even when at arms length. Wow. Huge aroma. Very complex and intense. Pure molasses and caramel notes come up first mixed in with some perfect Bourbon notes. Quite intense sweetness. Some woody notes are present as well as vanilla. There is tons of vanilla in the nose. The sweetness is balanced down with some slight woody notes and spice. There is some nice boozy heat on the nose as well.
T & M - Wow. This beer is huge but delicious. Wow. Its complex and initially blew me away. I didn't think I would be able to pull this off. After a couple of more sips I was able to tame the strength. It starts off with pure sweet caramel and molasses, tons of brown sugar, dark dark fruits. Liquid vanilla notes as well as some nice sweet Bourbon rich notes. There is a real boozyness to this beer with some nice heat finishing of the beer and lingering sip after sip. This might not be the best Double Stout but its close and it definitely is the strongest IMO. There is some chocolate notes and slight bitterness that struggles to come through the full bodied sweetness of this beer.
O - Awesome brew. It definitely deserves the hype but maybe note the price ;). Great full body with awesome flavors that linger for a long time. 1,574 charactersJoEBoBpr, Aug 31, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -10.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Review #201 (right after Kate the Great on the same day)
A: Pours medium thick with minimal head, though this was split 4 ways into snifters and poured slowly. Color looks to be dark brown, not as black as I expected. Lacing is minimal but as expected for such high ABV. 3.5
S: Smell is pretty dominant on bourbon, but isn’t as intense as straight Kentucky bourbon. There’s also a decent overlay of chocolate and toffee. The melody of flavors really come through as it warms too. 4
T&M: For such a high ABV this goes down real smooth. There is some throat warming but it’s complimentary and not too overwhelming. Taste is sweeter than I expected, but consists of Bourbon, chocolate, toffee, a little bit of raisin. Very nice. 4 / 4.5
O: Overall this was a pretty good RIS. Not as thick as I was hoping for, but the barrel aging component of this beer was damn good. A little sweeter than I expected, but this doesn’t detract from the overall experience. In fact, I liked it that way. 4 997 charactersjulian, Aug 29, 2011
4.78/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5'10 bottle
Appearance was black as black can be. No lacing, just jet black goodness.
Smell was sweet, maybe too sweet for some. Perfect for me though. I got big BA on the nose as well.
Taste was BA goodness, no sign of the ABV. Straight barrel, oak, vanilla yumminess. NOT hot!
Mouthfeel followed suit. Sticky, cloying, thick, viscous. Everything I love in a BA stout.
Overall, way overhyped! Probably the best BA stout I have had, but not worth trading a cellar over. I love this stout, but would easily keep some Bourbon County over it. Once it is more readily available, we'll see. 589 charactersJRorie, Aug 21, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Special thanks to Mike for bringing this to last nights tasting. Out of a snifter, 2010 bottle.
A- Pitch black. Little to no head, and light ring remains. No lacing, but a film coats the inside of the glass.
S- Sweet and boozy. Some notes of dark fruit and bourbon. Some oak, soy, and chocolate.
T- This stuff is seriously sweet. Strong notes of bourbon and dark malt and molassas. I get some oak and chocolate as well, plus some coffee notes. As I was drinking it, I couldn't help but think to myself "This tastes a lot like Sugar Daddies"
M- Definitely a little cloying, but the body and carbonation were spot on. Not too thick, and surprisingly drinkable for the ABV.
O- Overall, a great beer but maybe a little over hyped. It is so sweet, I just couldn't picture myself drinking too much more than I had. A very nice sipper, and a great beer to have tried.

4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52010 Vintage. Big thanks to Jeff for sharing this bottle. 
A: Pours (shockingly) black with much more of a head than I was expecting for a beer so big. Appears to have some nice carbonation.
S: Aroma is great! Bourbon, chocolate and oak really all come together nearly perfectly here. 
T: Taste follows the smell, with bourbon, chocolate and oak as the dominant flavors. It's quite sweet, but not cloying. Impressively balanced flavor for a beer so big and doesn't taste overly boozy.
M: Mouthfeel is a little on the thinner side for a beer so big, but not necessarily in a bad way. Definitely a little sticky-sweetness left in your mouth as well.
O: I was definitely a fan of this one, but it's a beer you really only need a small amount of. We split the bottle 4 ways and that was just fine with me, I didn't really need to have more than that. We all kinda came to the conclusion that it's a great dessert beer, but I'm not sure it's more than that. I'd love to try it with some age, and I'm glad I got to try it, but I can't think of a time where I would really ever be craving to drink this beer again. 1,112 charactersstarrdogg, Aug 10, 2011
4.07/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. 2010 bottle, from notes.
Appearance: In my tulip, Black Tuesday lives up to its name, being black all the way through with just a slightly lighter edge if I tilt the glass to make it thin enough. 
Smell: Lots of gooey dark chocolate and fusel alcohol, with a little coffee and a fair amount of dark roasted malt to back it up. 
Taste: Each sip starts out very sweet and feels boozy going down. Molasses, dark chocolate, some vanilla, and brown sugar add further sweetness to caramel and roasted malt flavors. 
Mouthfeel: This has a very full body with medium carbonation. Although, I wonder if it would be possible for a beer with this thick of a body to have any more carbonation or whether the body would simply crush it. There is definitely a full burn going down, which is slightly unpleasant because it feels unnatural. There is no bourbon or other flavor that accompanies it, it is just there for its own sake.
Overall: This was a good beer and I think the Bruery executed what they wanted out of this beer, but I think it is just too over the top for me. 1,108 charactersKickInTheChalice, Aug 09, 2011

 Thanks to Nicks6217 for the bottle 2010 version
 Shared with several Sydney area BA's
A-- Slight gusher on opening, poured a dark cola color and settled black (honestly thought hunaphu was much darker in color). No head at all just touches of cola looking film. Obvious ABV legs, though not as oily as hunaphu was. Carbonation?? Yeah, none present. 
S-- Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark fruits, Carmel and maple syrup. Well hidden ABV in the smell. 
T-- Vanilla, bourbon, chocolate syrup. Sweet and sticky. 
M-- Sweet, oily, and thin?? Really sweet and slick but thin as heck. German chocolate cake soaked in wine and bourbon. Not nearly as hot as I was expecting. 
O-- Had no expectations on this and it was impressive. No way I could drink a 750 on my own. Found it to be enjoyable and interesting mostly due to how complex it is. I thought very similar to Bourbon County Vanilla but much smoother and more complex. 1,006 charactersmulder1010, Aug 08, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The Heaven Hill version, thanks to mulder1010 for sharing this bottle
Slight gusher with a nice black colour and not a lot of head.
Smell is a whole bunch of chocolate with a lot of red winey/porty notes. Bourbon contribution was noted
Taste was very sweet and further resembled a chocolate red wine or port. The alcohol was well hidden, but there was a lot of sweetness.
Mouthfeel was relatively thin.
Overall this beer was very enjoyable and unique. Do not think I could handle a huge amount of this beer myself due to the large doses of residual sweetness, but it works well in a tasting context. Very much worth trying. 628 charactersdanieelol, Aug 07, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 Vintage. Really been waiting a while to try this and I just moved so what better beer to break in the new house.
A= Pours into my Duvel Tulip a deep black color with a nice finger of head on it that falls fast and leaves a coca cola like fizz on top of the glass. A somewhat impressive head despite the size of the beer. The lacing is nowhere and the bubbles left after a while come strictly from the laser etching on the glass.
S= Smells of sweet sticky booze. Molasses comes to mind as well as maple syrup. The barrel comes through in a more minimal sense. The vanilla is present but again a bit minimal. An interesting mix. Nothing I would concider to be that amazing.
T= The taste is actually a bit suprising. Really sweet. The booze isn't as prominate as I would have expected. The sweetness is almost unbearable however. There is a big booze sting to it that dies a bit as it warms. Molasses come through the most. A decent bit of barrel and vanilla comes through as well. Mostly just really sweet though with a big booze bite.
M= The mouth is actually pretty thick for the size of the beast. Thick and slick like oil. There is a bit of an alcohol vapor left in my mouth that thins it out a bit in the finish.
O= This isn't as transending as I thought it would be. It is mostly just different because the hype and following this beer has. Worth checking out for sure and an amazing beer but it isn't nearly what people have said it is. In the end this is still a huge RIS with a ton of sugars in it. For what this beer is and where it came from I will say it is great though. Worth checking out but not worth blowing the bank. I think most local RIS's have a more nostalgic effect and are usually better per individuals taste. 1,742 charactersjjanega08, Aug 03, 2011

A- Pours pitch black color, slight tan head that dissipates to nothing, no lacing; no apparent carbonation as well, from the appearance I can tell this is going to be a big beer. 
S- Huge bourbon flavors, vanilla, alcohol is present, caramel, slight coffee presence, some dark fruits, raisins, plums.
T- Now this is a big beer, I was not turned off at all by how high the abv is, I can definitely tell the alcohol is there but I liked the warming effect it had, I’m really impressed with this massive brew, nice sweet malts, oak, vanilla, slight chocolate taste, coffee, big bourbon flavors are there, dark fruits, raisins, plums, I can see what everyone is saying about the 2009 vintage, ageing this beer would do wonders, still really impressed.
M- Big mouth feel, coats the palate, slight carbonation, sticky.
O- Very grateful to dougofthefuture for bringing this beer to the dinner tonight, I’ve been wanting to try any vintage I could get a hold of and now I finally have. Big Big beer that I hope to get a hold of again. 1,100 charactersChriscrundwell12, Aug 01, 2011

4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 batch, wow, don't see this one every day.
This one pours a still black inky liquid that looks exactly how i always thought it would. There are legs to meet anybodys desires.
The aroma gives a sweetness off right away but then makes it take on natural fruity sugars likeness, and cuts it down with a hefty alcohol presence. 
The flavors are integrating very nicely it seems. My two worries going into this pour was either it being cloying or soy sauce, and i can say in this bottle neither was the case. I can see how some people could get either from this, but i found both aspects to be minimal enough that they contributed to the overall flavor componants in a positive manor. The alcohol and barrel flavors of vanilla and caramel, the rich chocolate, and those dark currants and fruits rolled in sugar.
This 2009 bottle was awesome, i really dug it. i wonder how this beer is fresh though. 898 charactersChadQuest, Jul 05, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 vintage. This one pours a viscous oily midnight black with no head. It smells of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and intense dark fruit sweetness. It has a really sweet nose. It drinks of chocolate coffee syrup and is insanely flavorful despite the sweetness. The chocolate and dark fruits work very well together. It's smooth, thick, and syrupy and could be hard to finish due to sugar and alcohol but its an intense imperial stout. This is just a massive beer and despite the abv, is not too hot having mellowed slightly, being the 2009 vintage. While good, I don't know why this vintage demands so much on the trade block. 630 charactersaasher, Jun 25, 2011

A: Pour an inky black with raisin colored edges. The thin dark tan head left a few patches of lacing, but as I lightly swirl the liquid in my glass freaking legs of alcohol are left like in wine. This is going to be fun. 
S: Super sweet smelling and alcoholic with notes of vanilla, caramel and bourbon. Very rich and dark.
T: Again, very sweet and boozy. I felt the flavors were actually not very complex, but I still think it tastes very good. Picture a really good straight forward well integrated stout. It has all the right flavors one would expect such as vanilla, chocolate, molasses, caramel, raisin, and bourbon, and it has it in all the right ways. I get raisin in the finish, and aftertaste is full of vanilla and chocolate and definitely lingers long as the swallow. 
M: Ultra thick and syrupy with a boozy and hot mouthfeel that isn’t necessarily uncomfortable.
O: A really solid and impressive beer that is not for the light of heart. There are better stouts out there of this caliber, but over-all the hype is pretty close to worth it. Thanks again Mike for the pour. 1,148 charactersscottfrie, Jun 25, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Just wow! Neorunner you sent me probably one of the best beers I have ever received trading directly or BIF. I am just blown away by your generous blinded beer. You have humbled me. The bottle is marked share x2. The bottle has a thin black wax wrap. 
This beer was shared between 4 people. It was a very fitting and worthy beer for the occasion. The beer was split 4 ways and served in tulip glasses. 
A - 4.5 The body of the beer is black and totally impenetrable by light. I could almost mistake this for 40 weight oil. The head was the coloration of nugget from a 3 Muskateers candy bar. The head resolved to a thin ring of foam. No lacing noted on the glass.
S - 5.0 The aroma of bourbon rises out of the bottle when cracked at arms length. At this point if you don't love bourbon its time to walk away. Lucky for me my companions love the bourbon! The aroma is very similar to making good bourbon balls. Cocoa, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate cake covered in bourbon, a lot of bourbon booze present but not a problem. Someone has masterfully used a bourbon barrel to great effect!
T - 5.0 A brilliant use of a bourbon barrel. Bourbon soaked chocolate cake, figs, dates, raisins, vanilla. Very sweet and darkly roasted malt notes. The alcohol is used as a foil to keep the sweetness in check. Absolutely no harshness noted to the flavor. This only gets better as the beer warms up. 
M / D - 5.0 / 5.0 This is a perfectly viscous and thick beer. Very very full bodied. Makes me feel like Mix-Alot. My anaconda dont want none unless you got buns. Baby got Back! This is a perfect beer drinking experience. Literally everything I hope for in a barrel aged RIS. My beer buzz tells me this is 15% +. The actual drinking experience feels about 10 - 12 %. 
I mentioned I was blown away by this generous beer offering. Thank you Nate - Neorunner! The rest of the package could be crazy eds barrel aged chili beer and cask Colt .45 I would be completely satisfied. 
The reveal: Bruery Black Tuesday. Dude you are a maniac! 2,025 charactersnlmartin, Jun 14, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009 edition
Super inky black color (as expected). Thick & with viscous lacing left around the glass. Thin layer of tan head.
Aroma is almost pure bourbon - it comes through so strongly that you really can't pick up much of anything else (possibly some hints of vanilla).
Flavor is a bit better with the maltiness fighting its way through the bourbon a bit more than in the nose. The sweetness makes itself known as well. Not bad by any means - I just prefer a bit more complexity.
Mouthfeel is great - the thick feel of this one really works well for this beer.
The finish is (not surprisingly) very strong and boozy - can't imagine I'd be able to put way too much of this stuff - its a big bold bourbon bomb of a beer so if you like that sort of thing you will LOVE this.
Recommended, but maybe a bit underwhelming - just not as complex as I'd hoped for - maybe with more time the bourbon would chill out a bit and mingle in with the other flavors but for me that overly bourbony aspect detracted from my overall enjoyment of the beer. 1,043 charactersthetomG, Jun 13, 2011

The beer pours like motor oil with a thin barely there dark head. the smell is sweet boozy with a noticeable bourbon smell. the taste is hot boozy and cloyingly sweet. this beer reminds me of dark lord, ( which i thought was highly overrated). the mouthfeel is thick and its hard to get the coating feel out of your mouth. between everyone at the tasting it was probably a 50/50 split of love hate. i gave the rest of my pour to my brother who enjoyed it. in my opinion this beer is one to avoid 577 charactersrowingbrewer, Jun 05, 2011

A: Pours dark, opaque black with a dark brown head. Obvi, hard to get an accurate vision of it's true appearance consider my taster only held a 4oz pour, but I was definitely in awe regardless.
S: Smells very boozy up front with hints of chocolate, coffee, and rich malty goodness. 
T: For me, the taste lives up to the hype of this incredible beer! Very similar to the smell, and the boozy taste is incredibly smooth for such a high abv.
M: Thick, but very smooth and warm going down.
O: Overall, very impressed! Very complex flavoring, that is beyond my less experienced palette. Also, want to give a BIG THANK YOU to The Bruery for pulling our ticket in the lottery give-away. We now have a bottle of Black Tuesday to keep and save for a special occassion. VERY excited to try it again! 878 charactersLuvzsurfrz, May 31, 2011

A: Black body with dark brown highlights; thin, fleeting head of light brown foam. Looks big, and there's no surprise there.
S: Booze, coffee, booze, chocolate, booze, earthiness, and booze. Hugely alcoholic, and yet somehow also hugely appealing. 
T: Cloyingly sweet here, and that's about it. Seriously, this is sweeter than Vanilla Bean Dark Lord, and in this case that's not a complement. Crazy.
M: Thick, sticky. Yup.
O: I was really excited to try this beer (obviously enough), and wasn't sure what to expect. Smelling it made me think that I'd fall in love with its sheer vastness of flavor, but when it came to the point of actually tasting the beer it was a serious letdown. All the complexity of the aroma got washed out in a massive wave of underattenuated sugar, so much so that it resembled beer-flavored pancake syrup more than actual beer. Now that I've tried it, I definitely won't be trading my whole cellar for more.

I wondered if the day I got to try this would ever come? Fortunate enough to be invited to a tasting and this beauty was on the docket. Poured into my Darkness snifter. My 3oz pour is black with brown on the outskirts. A good looking mocha colored head sets atop. I make sure I smell the bottle before I pass it down the line. It smells exactly like a sweet chocolate chip cookie soaked in booze. That doesn't sound at all horrible does it! (sarcasm right there folks) This beer is pretty damn sweet. A lot of chocolate and bourbon. Some amount of dark fruit in there. I've read that the alcohol is hidden well for being 18%. I say false. The hot bite is certainly there. Leaves your throat very warm and you can feel it trickle down into your chest. Me personally I liked that aspect. It's a big giant beer. Lots of bourbon and chocolate.
Ultimately I am really glad I was able to try this. So much hype around it that it pulls you in. It was a good beer but not excellent or the best I've ever had by any means. There were other stouts poured at this tasting as well. In my opinion Rare was far superior. If you don't have to trade away half your cellar it is worth a shot. 1,225 charactersTheDudeRules, May 29, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is possibly the best beer that I have had in my life, especially stout-wise. There is a ton going on in it, more than my palate can properly identify or process.
Great dark pour with some swirling head into a wonderfully dark mess in my glass.
Even the smell has hints of vanilla, bourbon, and strong other flavors. It's super involved, and I can't pick everything out. 
The taste is just as much going on in the beer as the smell, if not more. I get vanilla, bourbon, caramel, a little roasty, and just a great balance of a ton of flavors. This beer is super-complex and super alcoholy, but quite delicious. 616 charactersrhodeska, May 25, 2011

Black Tuesday is, ironically, not "black" enough; frankly it belongs more in the -bal Barleywine/Strong Ale territory than among Imperial Stouts. Looks, smell, taste... on all counts.
The aroma is an overload of delicious things: vanilla, sweet booze, and tons of dark fruit. Very appealing, if a little rough.
The taste has a lot of bourbon, and more. Vanilla, obviously; and rum soaked dried dark fruit with plenty of bitter-sweet-tart darkness. Think prunes and raisins, but more complex and infinitely boozier.
I can't believe that this beer is appearing thin on the palate and I think that it has to be with the insanely high ABV. Even though it's clean, it's still very sweet. I am loving the taste but I am certainly not digging the mouthfeel, that is into the moderate strength liqueur territory.
A brewing achievement but not beer like; delicious nonetheless. I am very glad that I got to try it, and I don't think I could have without Joe's generosity. Thanks again! 1,101 characterstewaris, May 24, 2011

Served at room temp, it poured a super jet black with a one finger, light brown head. Smell is dark, boozy chocolate and what seems to be dry wood. Taste is syrupy dark chocolate as well as some vanilla and honey dipped marshmallow. Mouthfeel on this beer was the highlight to me--a very full, viscous body that’s complimented by a supporting chewy malty-ness. Definitely a hot finish in the throat. 
The noticeable abv makes it a dry finish after swallowing, but this beer was super sweet with lots of rich malt and there’s no way I could enjoy more than 3oz. 658 characterssarro, May 24, 2011

A: Black Hole dark, pretty badass and intimidating.
S: Phenomenal bourbon notes. I don't know what these guys use to age their beers in but its golden. All I can smell is bourbon, especially in the cold and rain.
T: EPIC! This was well worth what I traded for it. I thought it would disappoint based off the other reviews but it most definitely did not. Sweet vanilla and oak as it warmed, better than most Barrel aged brews I've come across.
M: Extremely viscous, very coating and adds to flavor production.
O: This is one that lives up to the hype! Very, very happy I have a bruery connection and can look forward to having another one of these, bourbon aged stout heaven! 760 charactersAlpar, May 24, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Thanks Jared & Kevin for making this review possible... An appropriately sinny rapturebeer™ if ever there was one. Review from written notes.
Into a small tulip glass it pours an imposing black with blood red ruby edges that glint in the light. Slim amount of foam, tan ring around the edge, surprising there was any foam considering the abv. The glassy obsidian surface reminds me of the oily black pool at Glastonbury Grove in Twin Peaks.
Toasted marshmallows, melted milk chocolate bars, deep roasty char. 
Rich and fudgy (understatement), caramel toffee, almond fudge, fried plantains, warm chocolate syrup. Mucho dry roast and bitter bakers chocolate in the aftertaste. So decadent. Impossibly dense, fudgy and chewy to the nth degree, a perfect liquid dessert. About 4 oz. is enough for one sitting, although I could certainly drink more if I forced myself. 868 charactersemerge077, May 24, 2011

A: This poured dark black with a very thin mocha head. I was surprised that it has this much carbonation.
S: It smelled like a very hot bourbon. I could get some dark malts, soy and some dark fruits as well.
T: The taste was pretty similar to the smell. At first I thought that the alcohol was fairly well hidden. But then, after about 10 seconds or so, the alcohol made its presence known. This went away as my senses got overwhelmed. I was also able to detect some great dark fruits and soy in the taste. It was better than I was anticipating.
M: The mouthfeel was OK. It was a little too heavy for my tastes.
O: I found this to be slightly better than average. The alcohol makes it near impossible to finish by yourself. I figured after 2 years that it would have tamed down some but it was still pretty hot. This might be better in another couple of years. I will re-visit in 2 years and re-rate. 939 charactersROBORB, May 22, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 Vintage. Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass.
Pours black with a fair amount of thick, brown head. Nice lacing.
Aroma: Tons of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, some coconut.
Taste: Chocolate, vanilla, coconut. Sweet. Really, really, really sweet. Some of complained that this is sickeningly sweet. I disagree. It is not something you would down on a summer afternoon after working in the yard, it is to be savored like a dessert wine or port.
Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy. 
Overall: This is a tremendous beer. It is like an almond joy bar in liquid form. If you don't like big sweet bourbon bombs, this is not the beer for you. But, if you are like me and love sweeter stouts...damn this is good. 712 charactershamilton23, May 21, 2011

Bottle to Bruery Tulip
750, Capped & Waxed
2010 Bottle
Split 6 ways for Bottle 5 of 5 for Birthday dinner. Even my wife, who most of you have seen me post about said this is pretty good.
App- This was a Black Stout, I have said it before, but this was damn dark. Only thing is that no head formed, no lacing not real carbonation level to it.
Smell- Everything I had heard about this about being hot, being too big in the aromatics was a little over done. This was big yes, but it was smooth, boozy, and sweet. Smelled a lot like a port vs a stout. Very dark chocolate with the dark fruits and Bourbon scents with some vanilla as well.
Taste- Not at all how hot I thought it would be. It was big and rich and lush. The flavors were very mellow but you can tell the ABV on this while smash you alone. The vanilla and chocolate blend with some some of the port flavors.
Mouth- This is exactly how I felt a stout should be on the palate. It was lush, creamy, smooth, rich, decadant and full. A very full bodied stout with a low carbonation.
Drink- I sat on this bottle since its release in October for a special occasion and I fiqured a birthday to be one of them. I am sure Ill keep trying to acquire this year to year. Wonderful brew! To the team at The Bruery. Nicely done. 1,297 charactersFosterJM, May 21, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I want to drink a whole bottle of this by myself. Next birthday, if I'm not double-fisting Cantillons, I'll be drinking this straight out of the bottle, probably wrapped in a paper bag to make it super ghettofab.
A - It pours an oily dark-brown hue, literally appearing like filthy motor oil. It has some red around the edges, and is capped with a crimson-tinged khaki head that recedes to a minimal frothy film.
S - The nose is ridiculously decadent; molasses, dark and milk chocolate, Bourbon and Kahlua, chocolate-covered cherry cordials, and the charred top of Creme Brulee all come to mind. Given the ABV, booze is understated.
T - The taste is fabulous. Rich notes of roasted grain, molasses, dark chocolate, vanilla, Bourbon, charred sugar, toffee and sweet medjool dates are proffered, and the resulting brew is supremely delicious, and exceptionally decadent. The brew is intensely flavorful, literally saturating your palate with the richness of the elements at play. 
M - Big, rich and luscious.
O - I did not find this brew to be exceptionally hot; it is, however, definitely on the sweet side. I tend to like some relatively sweet beers, if they are well done; exquisite (and disparate) examples that come to mind are JW Lees Harvest Ale, Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock, BCS Rare, TREAT, 100% BA Coton, Vanilla DL, Brandy Hunahpu, Westvleteren 12, Gouden Carolus Cuvee Van De Kaiser Blauw, etc. This is definitely a brew of that ilk, in terms of being a delicious nectar of the Gods, and it is as good as any one of the aforementioned brews. 1,555 charactersktrillionaire, May 18, 2011

4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sampled with RandomBattle and some others on a NY trip home:
Appearance - there is no head whatsoever on this beer, very reddish brown in color, like the color of dark leather
Smell - vanilla, and bourbon. Very enjoyable, probably one of the best smelling BA Stouts
Taste - Wow this beer will creep up on you. With such a smooth taste I can imagine downing more than I realize when that ABV hits me. Lots of dark fruits, sweet molasses and a bit of vanilla towards the end.
Mouthfeel - Considering the style, its pretty thin, not the huge chunky mess that some other stouts have become at this point. However, I think it did work out pretty well considering its drinkability.
Overall - great beer, I realize its very hyped but I'm impressed with what I got when I got to try it 782 charactersPhoenix2443, May 08, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've had the 2009 vintage once and the 2010 vintage out of the bottle 5 times and on tap once. The 09 is substantially better than the 2010. Not sure if this is due to the alcohol variation or age, but likely both.
This review is from a recent stout tasting I had - thanks to Mark for sharing - you're awesome!
A - Small amount of mocha head that did not stick around very long. This is dark like night, sticky yet silky, which I didn't even know was possible.
S - I smelled this for a few minutes before diving in. I didn't get any alcohol on the nose. Very complex, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and raisins. Love this smell - every time you go in for a whiff it's slightly different.
T - Amazing! The Bruery knocked it out of the park. Sweetness, vanilla, molasses, maple syrup, roast, chocolate, bourbon, alcohol is present but subdued.
D - I could probably drink half the bottle myself before the sweetness would take it's toll, however I would never do that because this a gem that can only be shared with a few people. What a great treat! 1,049 charactersjbtice0315, May 07, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Some kind soul gave me a pour at DLD. From the BT '09 bottle.
Pours a sugar-shimmering black with a small ring of whitish-tan head. This is big and looks yummy. The nose is enormous vanilla, with the rest being hints of wood, bourbon, chocolate, roast. But, this is a big huge vanilla bomb. One of the best smelling beers I've had. Unbelievable taste of vanilla bourbon. Side flavors of wood, and chocolate, roast, coffee, a touch of dark fruit. Definitely a sweet sipper of a beer. Little to no booziness, which is a shocking feat (might be the age). Unlike Bourbon County Rare, this has less depth of flavor and more punch you in the face vanilla. The mouthfeel is excellent, big, sticky with low carbonation. One of the top few beers I have ever had. Wow. Liked this better than Chocolate Rain, though everyone else felt the opposite way. This is legit.
[edit: since had this a few times and am dinging it a bit because none of my other goes have been quite as good as the original review] 994 charactersseeswo, May 05, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Had this at the Black Tuesday event at the Bruery and split a bottle with my friends at a later date, this review is a combination of the two.
Enjoyed out of a Bruery tulip. (how appropriate)
Appearance - Well, there is no head whatsoever on this beer. At first I figured it was because of the small pour at the event but having it a second time, with a larger amount in the glass, yielded the same result. Otherwise its black in the core with hints of reddish brown on the edges.
Smell - A wonderful combination of vanilla, chocolate, malts, and bourbon. Very pleasant and balanced, a lot of people say they just smell booze, while that wouldn't be unthinkable given the ABV there are a lot more wonderful aromas going on in there. My one friend, literally, could not take his nose out of his snifter, he loved it. 
Taste - It's amazing. Asides hitting your tongue with a balanced myriad of BB RIS flavors, it is frighteningly smooth. I've had beers that were 10% and had a mild alcohol burn to them. This, not in the slightest. Nothing but smooth sweet vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, and some really nice port wine flavors. Fantastic.
Mouthfeel - Well it is incredibly smooth as I said, however it's not as thick as some other RIS's out there, which is in no way a bad thing, as a matter of fact it completely works for this beer. If it was any thicker this beer would be a bit overwhelming.
Overall - It's great. Very happy to have enjoyed this beer. I am supremely excited to open up the rest of the bottles I have in the future, and am looking forward to going to the Black Tuesday event again this year. 1,613 charactersRandomBattle, May 04, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Khumbard for pouring this. Bottle 2010.
A: Pours a dark brown, almost black, but not quite. Not quite as thick as I was expecting, more like a strong ale, less an RIS. A thin layer of tan foam.
S: Smells sweet, with vanilla, and raisins/prunes, hint of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Booze, lots of booze.
T: Sweet and boozy. Raisins and prunes are dominate, with hints of oak, vanilla, dark chocolate nuances, but not as much as the nose would suggest.
M/D: Thinner than the style would suggest, good carbonation. Thought this would have benefited from being thicker, or maybe I just should not have expected it. The alcohol is very present, but it makes itself known after the swallow right in the middle of the chest. Very much like a whisky would. Awesome beer though. 793 characterscpmichael, May 02, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Much thanks to Adam for busting this out at our tasting.
Pours a jet black with almost no head, not surprising, looks intimidating, all the rumors must be true....
Aroma is some vanilla and oak, a pretty good bit of gooze on the nose. Roast malt comes through in a big way. Pretty hot and equally as intimidating as the appearance.
Taste is big and intense, very hot. Vanilla is evident, along with a big roast character. It's surprisingly sweet, from beginning to end.
Mouthfeel is extremely thick and it really coats the mouth and lingers long after the sip. I think this one will age well but its kind of hot and intense now. Without the hype, I doubt it would get such high numbers. 690 characters321jeff, May 01, 2011
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 vintage, poured into a snifter. 
The infamous Black Tuesday. The brew utilizes 2,500 pounds of grain -- more than double any of the brewery's usual recipes, along with several different forms of sugar, making it a pain in the ass to work with. According to brewer Patrick Rue, Tuesday, July 1, 2008 turned out to be a fateful day in Bruery history: "I go to check on how full the drum is, and decide to put a bit more in there. I open the valve, and the mash forcefully falls into the drum. It is flowing everywhere. I try to close the valve, but it's jammed. Mash and 170 degree water is flying everywhere. It's a tidal wave of hot shit, all over my arms, legs, in my boots, and the brewery is a disaster." As punishment, he threw the brew in time-out for a year in bourbon barrels, and here we are. 
Upon popping the cap, a soft smoke rises from the neck, followed by the slow lava flow of cocoa-colored bubbles. I pour it into my glass before I get any overflow. The bubbles are soapy and short-lived, not holding together well and becoming a medium-sized ring. The color is black, obviously, but it’s got nice viscosity and leaves thick, clear legs upon the swirl. 
Absolutely tons of vanilla and oak in the nose, met with a nearly equal amount of dark, sweet Morello cherry syrup. In the background, there’s dark chocolate, toast, molasses , caramelized sugar and hints of licorice and anise. It’s definitely a sweeter aroma, but damn fine. 
This is just all the best parts of a bourbon-aged stout. Very sweet initially, with lots of vanilla-soaked dark cherries and plums. Star anise peeks out its little head occasionally as well. Notes of dark chocolate truffle, black strap molasses and maple syrup linger long after the finish. It’s definitely a saccharine flavor — they must’ve been playing Pour Some Sugar On Me in the brewhouse that fateful Tuesday. I could use a bit more roast and a touch more sweetness, but we’re really splitting hairs here — this is an incredible flavor.
Just a touch of carbonation, which is pretty perfect here. Medium-full, creamy body is sugar-filled and nearly syrupy, but goes down so smoothly. The alcohol, at 18.2 percent by volume, is unavoidable, numbing the tongue and bringing lots of warmth through the nose and chest. It;s no worse than any other top-tier BA stout I’ve had, however.
The hype is well-deserved — Black Tuesday is a monstrous, flavorful, delicious beer made for sipping and sharing. Pair it with chocolate-dipped cookies like I did and even a stock market crash wouldn’t phase you. 2,578 charactersPhelps, Apr 26, 2011
4.09/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Dyan for bringing this to our recent tasting. Put together in a side-by-side with Chocolate Rain. Bottle is from the 2010 vintage.
Thick and viscous, just as the name implies. It pours with no head, a thick tar-colored liquid that splashes its way into the glass without producing even bubbles. However, surprisingly, around the edges, there is a garnet/brown/ruby hue that appears in the presence of some backlighting.
The aroma is big and bold, just as I expected. Lots of soy sauce in there, along with dark chocolate, warm booze that may be just a bit too much at this point, and some vanilla. Bourbon and the oaky and also extract-like vanilla come through to round out the aroma, but they are still competing a bit too much with the high alcohol for my taste.
The flavor has all the balance that the aroma lacks. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla, interplay beautifully in front of the prickly alcohol heat. Some soy sauce and dark fruit oxidation yields dates and prunes that work very well with the barrels. The soy sauce doesn't detract from the beer one bit, and in fact, I think it helps to enhance it.
There is a prickly alcohol presence with due to the gravity of this delectable brew. This isn't so much balanced, per se, but rather well proportioned, as nothing with this much bourbon, booze, and barrel characteristics can strive to be anything more balanced than this is 1,393 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Apr 23, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Have had a Black Tuesday about a half dozen times now, but all small pour tasters at The Bruery, or their Reserve Society events. This review, however, is based on a 2010 bottle, that was shared with me and a few others by Skuter (thanks Scott) in celebration of his 1 year wedding anniversary with his wife. Anyhow, on to the review. 
A: Black, with a murky dark deep brown hue, light film of head. Not really lacing on the glass, more just a very noticeable coating, on the glass, like thin motor oil. 
S: Very complex, with layered and melded scents. Imperial stout soaked Dark fruits at first, such as Figs, dates, plums, followed by the Heaven Hill bourbon barrel character, kiss of oak, vanilla, and caramel, then finely fresh ground espresso beans, and roasted malts. 
T: Fantastic layers of dark cacao chocolate, baked and moist chocolate cake, bourbon soaked dark fruits again, tongue massaging light oak, vanilla, caramel, roasted coffee, and rich, creamy finish. 
M: Lightly carbonated, sticky, sweet, full, slick, and viscous. Chewy like a brownie. 
O: An amazing beer, and real treat to taste every time. (though I do like Chocolate Rain better) It's not hard to tell that the claim on the bottle (will age for decades) will likely be true, given that it is over 18% ABV, so it will age much like a Port wine imho. I'm very thankful I still have a bottle of the 2009, and two of the 2010 in my cellar. As part of the RS,(which to me personally, was worth every penny, and I'm enjoying being a part of it) I'm looking forward to the 2011 batch. 1,561 charactersRetsinis, Apr 23, 2011

Hugh thanks to the generosity of BeerFM Andy for sharing this one of a kind brew. Pours a thick midnight black a la motor oil with a two finger tan head. Sweet aroma taste which is body slammed by the hot booziness. Great tones of chocolate, vanilla, mild bourbon, and molasses. 
 A cage match in a glass between the sweet and the booze which can be fatiguing. Think I'll skip the next train fuel station and just pour Black Tuesday into the tank. A powerhouse of a stout. 518 charactersTheDTrain, Apr 22, 2011

A: Well, it's certainly a dark beer. Very thin amount of head with the pour. Pretty average looking for a imperial stout
S: First whiff was almost straight booze. Settled down after that to reveal notes of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate and graham cracker. There is still some booze present but it gets mostly covered up by the other characters. Decadent nose
T: This is a really complex beer. Not quite as chocolately as I was expecting but this flavor does come out more as time went by. I got a wonderful blend of cherry, caramel, light roast, chocolate and some bourbon booziness. Detected a little soy sauce as well
M: Basically as full bodied as a beer can get. Not quite on the level of Kate though. Creamy, boozy chocolate finish
D: Split amoungst 8 people, the group was unamiously impressed by this beer. Certainly worthy of the praise it gets but may be a little too high on the hype scale. Trust me, I would drink this all the time if possible but it's just way too hard to get 1,117 charactersBrez07, Apr 20, 2011

Poured into snifter revealing a deep brownish black color. Slight head that was erased without any residual lacing on the glass. Really enjoyed the smell on this one. I picked up sweet chocolate and brown sugar with some vanilla and oak. Tasted very similar with brown sugar shining through with some chocolate, toffee, bourbon and sweet vanilla. Pretty thick and syrupy, but it blended pretty well and anymore could have been too much on the taste. Very drinkable for + 18% and as it warmed up I enjoyed this beer more even though it was the last one open at our tasting. 619 charactersmistakebythelake, Apr 17, 2011

The greatest meld of chocolate and bourbon for a series of beer, this one has plenty, and until I tried the chocolate rain version, I hadn't had a better example/mix of the beauty the two can do together. The vanilla and slightly charred oak feel is around, its warming, but for 18% it really is so nice. A rounded leather and tobacco blend can make you feel like you're in a Western. Every time I drink BT it burns itself into my memory. BT release night, Christmas fire etc. . . 
Such a great 'base' beer for all the melanges/rain variations. Greatest cigar beer of all time. Sweetness. Every aspect is huge. It is very warming. Boozy, but never harsh. 
Ended up rationalizing to write this review, I need to print a new 'my' top 1/2/300 list for my house anyways, such a completionist.
EDIT: Man, just had my first bottle of the 2011 last weekend during the Lesnar/Overeem fight. Might be the best one yet, and the appearance is just delightful. 1,132 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Apr 14, 2011

A - Black with brown edges. Little head that dies to bubbly foam around the edges. Slinky lacing retention.
S - Nice bourbon, cream, chocolate and roast. Caramel and brown sugar. Candy, booze and wood. 
T - Booze and candy sugar. Chocolate, roast and booze. A bit sweet and fruits, with dark fruits like plums and figs and booze. Oak and pretty hot, probably from the booze. Did I mention that this is pretty boozy?
M - Slightly smooth. Stinging sensation from the booze heat. Heavy and thick, but expected.
D - Not the easiest thing to drink. Thank God that I didn't have to drink this by myself. Although it was a pretty good beer, I think the hype train has taken this for a ride. I'm really glad I got to try it but I won't be seeking it in the future. We even mixed a bit of it with some 120 IPA to make a really extreme black and tan...it was an improvement.

4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 Vintage.
A- Pours a very dark brown with a 1 and a half finger light brown head. The bubbles are fairly large, though some smaller bubbles intermingle. The head recedes to a ring around the glass but there is surprisingly good head retention for a beer with this high of an alcohol content. Alcohol legs on the glass.
S- Smell jumped out as soon as I heard the first hiss from the cap as I was opening it. Bourbon and chocolate jump out first. Then some sweet dark fruit syrups with plumb and raisin. Over time the aroma became predominantly soy sauce and spicy teriyaki. Very Asian influenced.
T- Molasses, bourbon, and sweet dark fruit syrups (plumb, raisin) hit me first. This reminded me of Sweet Horizon. The soy sauce and spicy teriyaki began to take over the taste the more I drank. This is a very sweet beer. Light amounts of heat going down the esophagus into the belly. Not nearly as boozy as I thought this was going to be. Very approachable now, in fact. They did a nice job with this. 
M- Full bodied and smooth. Has a fairly high amount of carbonation in the mouth, actually. 
O- Very Asian influenced with the high levels of soy sauce and teriyaki in the aroma and taste. Surprised I haven't heard anything about this regarding this beer before. Other beers people claim to get these flavors I do not, while this beer to me was dominated by the salty Asian sauces. I think this is excellent stuff, though. Big, sweet, and full flavored. Has a delicious factor due to the sweetness. Great beer to split with a friend, or few.
2011 Black Tuesday review on 4/21/2012:
The bourbon and oak are backed down a bit in the taste on this vintage, and sweet caramel, molasses, and dark fruits reign supreme. The oak and bourbon fall to the background. A very sweet dessert beer. Heat is evident, though it presents more of a warming than a burn. One of the best out there. Wish there were more chocolate and bourbon flavors like the 2010, but just as good if not a little better than last years. 2,011 charactersTK5150, Mar 27, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5bottle poured into tasting glass. 2010 vintage. 
Pours a completely inky, opaque blackness with a decent layer of toffee brown head resting on top. The retention slowly sifts away leaving a collar of tanned lacing and head on the glass. 
Strong scents of smooth oaky bourbon with vanilla bean edges. Cocoa, brownies and chocolate syrup erupt from the nose, drenched in absolutely wonderful boozy warmth. 
Heavily roasted malts with caramel and chocolately notes. The bal aging kicks in nearly immediately, with strong yet pleasant touches of bourbon and vanilla tannins. Chocolate cake, brownies, and cocoa all combine into the richness, which nearly overwhelms the palate. More boozy warmth and syrupy sweetness towards the finish. 
The fullest of full bodies, lower carbonation, syrupy and sticky from top to bottom. This beer is ridiculously drinkable for the ABV, and the flavors are as absolutely mindblowing as the internet hype makes them seem to be. Don't be fooled, this is a one-of-a-kind beer. 1,008 charactersxnicknj, Mar 24, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow, what a beer! Celebrating Fat Tuesday with a Black Tuesday. This is from the first batch. For such a high alcohol beer there is an impressive head and while there is no lace the covering and ring on top is pretty. Smell leaves me impressed with the barrels used. Bourbony alcohol and light oak hit first but then there is a huge cherry and faint chocolate smoke. Vanilla and burnt caramel accentuates the overall sweetness. Taste is superb. It follows the nose but builds with a bigger oak component and a sublimated bourbon. Cherry sweetness has me seeing a box of Godiva as the chocolate is so milky. Vanilla flavored dark roasted malts, Bourbon is perfectly integrated and this reminds me of a bigger BB version of Kate. For the abv the alcohol is nigh on invisible. Don't get me wrong. You know it is there but nowhere near the actual level. Feel is amazingly carbonated for the amount of booze in the glass and it compliments the light syrupy feel perfectly. Sticky but easy to swallow and Pappy Van Winkle smooth. Drinkability is criminal. This goes down like Brooklyn Chocolate stout at almost twice the strength. So glad I've finally opened a bottle. 1,162 charactersscootny, Mar 09, 2011
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42010 vintage courtesy of hopderek at Imminent Liquidation - thanks!!
A: Pitch black, almost no head but it was there for a few seconds, oily looking body.
S: Bourbon....barrels...yup. Loads of seeping bourbon and wood notes from the barrel aging here. Some darker fruits (raisins, plums) and balanced caramel malt presence is here but definitely overshadowed by the bourbon.
T: A sweeter stout than I was expecting. Vanilla, bourbon, chocolate syrup, oak notes and sweet roasted malt again come into play. Very nicely balanced as these flavors seem to play off one another quite well. Nothing is dominating to the point that it doesn't allow the other flavors to shine. Damn straight!
M: Thick and oily, while retaining a certain creaminess about it that is what I always look for in an Imperial Stout. Slight carbonation bubbles that definitely doesn't detract from the body. Well done.
D: I mean, honestly, it's delicious but I couldn't drink much of this. I'd split the bottle and savor every sip. The alcohol is ridiculously high, so I can't score this really high.
Black Tuesday is absolutely worth it's hype. It's a beer every craft beer lover needs to get their hands on an sample at some point in time. Nicely done, boys. 1,235 charactersShanePB, Mar 07, 2011
3.92/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Thanks to hopderek for a pour of this bottle.
A: The stout is black, still as night and under siege. An off-white head comes along for the ride but doesn't amount to much.
S: The nose is punctuated by sweet bourbon. Darker stout aromas are present but take a backseat to the barrel.
T: The sweetness of the barrel, vanilla and dark fruits, along with the boozy strength stand out. Along side the barrel, the stout seems to be laiden with dark sugars and molasses, sweet but not cloying. The strength is hard to miss, rich and overpowering in every sip. The darker flavors, roasted as they are, fit in well amongst the sweet barrel flavors.
M: The mouthfeel is sweet, vanilla and stout flavors run strong through the ale. There is plenty of sweetness beyond the barrel, enough to border on Belgian stout territory.
D: Strong? Indeed. A good stout that makes use of its barrel provenance. It's big though, too big to really dig into. 936 charactersakorsak, Mar 06, 2011
4.14/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.502/26/11- Review of a 750mL bottle of the 2010 vintage at Cafe Bella for my birthday dinner!
A: Opaque black with chocolate hues, it poured with a tan lacing and a strong collar and film.
S: Strong dark chocolate and boozy bourbon, raisins, grape juice, slight cigar, plums and caramel malt. This has a really great aroma.
T: Very sweet, with a good bourbon character (and very slight vanilla), molasses, grape juice and champagne, orange peel and orange extract hops character... this is good but I have to dock some points for the cloying sweetness. This is probably one of the smoothest-drinking 18% stouts I'll ever have, though.
M: Thick, but with a cleansing alcohol.
D: OK. I'm impressed with how easy-drinking it is for the alcohol content, but still only a couple glasses is enough.
I'm really glad to have gotten the chance to try this. Imagine the combination of Abyss roast, Dark Lord sweetness, and Black Albert molasses and cigar character, all with a champagne wine character vs. port. 1,001 charactersne0m00re, Feb 28, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge Props to Abecall98 for providing this in trade about a year ago. This bottle is from the original release and is marked as 19.5% abv.
Pours into my tulip glass with an almost brown/copper head that doesn't last long and collapses upon it's own weight. A hint of things to come on just how big of a beer this is. More like "legs" in the glass vs. lacing. The beer coats the inside of the glass. A shiney dark brown/almost black color. Looks like a mixture of used motor oil and maple syrup or molasses.
The aroma was so intense, bold and complex I am not sure where to start. Sweet, chocolate, a touch of vanilla, even some chocolate syrup. Much less alcohol than I would have guessed for 19.5%
Holy snikees is this a big beer. The sweetness is really right in your face. Dessert in a glass. Chocolate syrup again, then this gives way to a lot of complexity. Dark chocolate, very slight bourbon & vanilla. Sweet roasted malt. Ok, I have to admit, I thought of ST Crème Brulee when I drank this, minus the big vanilla. What I find interesting is that was a LOVE/Hate beer due to the big sweetness. And this one is universally loved. It's consistent for me, as I am a Crème Brule fan. This just drinks like it should offend some more in my book. If I had a wish it was that the bourbon came through a little more. Perhaps the time has settled that flavor a bit. Got coconut at times mixed with the dark chocolate flavors. This went well with the sweetness.
Just and I mean just shy of syrup like. I said to a buddy that if I had vanilla ice cream we'd try the two together. Alas, I did not. Thick is the only word to use to describe the body. Slick on your tongue. But not cloying.
The abv is so well hidden that it's scary. The sweetness and complexity keeps it below the surface, but soon you get a warm happy feeling. It's very very good. Not a top ten for me, but I am stoked I had a chance to enjoy a bottle.
I did get a chance to try this at the beer fest last year but it was fun to share a bottle with a couple buddies.
Thanks Abel! 2,051 charactersReagan1984, Feb 27, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to my man Carleton (SpdKilz) for hooking me up with this bottle. Cheers buddy!
First beer enjoyed as part of a Bourbon Barrel Tasting.
The body could easily be mistaken for black, when held to the light deep brown hues were noted. Slim malted milk colored head sits atop momentarily though quickly fades to a slim ring. When swirling around the glass you can see the sryupy alcohol cling to the walls like a fine bourbon.
Utterly ridiculous aroma. Strong chocolate and bourbon, smells like a delicious chocolate liqueur. The chocolate is deep and fudge. The bourbon kicks off subtle hints of caramel and vanilla. Slight brown sugar scent fade in and out.
Black Tuesday may have peers but there is nothing that tops it when it comes to the flavor. Rich, decadent chocolate pairs with a smooth bourbon booziness. Smooth caramel and vanilla flavors are layered through out. Tremendous balance between the sweet and the boozy flavors.
Full bodied monster of a beer, carbonation is low and delicate. Very smooth, creamy texture. I love the viscosity of this beer. Rich and heavy flavors dig into the tongue making for a long but enjoyable finish.
Truly an outstanding beer, well worth the hype. It takes talent to craft a beer so massive and still being absurdly drinkable. From the aroma, to the flavor and mouthfeel everything about this beer is exceptional. The alcohol is very well disguised, very minimal burn. This is certainly not drinkable in the sense of quantity, it is however in the sense it would be far too easy to drink too much. 1,556 characterskzoobrew, Feb 23, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Much thanks to kzoobrew for bring this one to the tasting!
A - For a small (4-5oz pour) there was a significant amount of tan head on top of the dark black base. Head dissipates slowly, and then a syrupy viscosity coats the glass.
S - Booze. It dominates. Hints of chocolate and brown sugar. Overall, the tone is booze and sweet.
T - Highly bourbon, but shockingly smooth for the high abv. Some chocolate around in the middle, and some interesting fruit tones in the end that are a bit difficult to pick out. Wonderful.
M - Exactly what you want from a big bodied stout. Its entirely full and creamy, and coats the mouth. 
D - My wife could not finish hers (too boozy), so my 5ozs turned to around 9ozs. After that much, I was done, but the booze began to dominate. I dinged it a couple points just because of that. 820 charactersdecadance, Feb 20, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to mattolesh for the trade and the opportunity to try this beer!
750ml bottle split with my girlfriend, going by the alcohol by volume on the label, this is a 2010 bottle. Poured into a Southampton IRS release day snifter. Took it out of the cellar the morning I was going to drink it and put it in the fridge, let it warm up for about 15 minutes before pouring. It was also drank over the course of about an hour, so I got a lot of different temperatures.
Look: Pours black, with dark brown highlights around the edges of the glass. I'm surprised how its not quite pitch considering the size. Though there's not much head, I'm surprised how much there is. I get a thin layer of mocha colored head that disappears in a minute or so, which is understandable considering the alcohol content of this beer. Surprisingly, there are carbonation bubbles visible close to the top floating to the top of the beer. Very nice looking beer.
Smell: warm, bourbon aroma. Surprisingly, not as powerful as some other bourbon barrel beers are but its still quite powerful. If you've had Bourbon Brand County Stout, its a little more subtle than that. Dark malt with hints of chocolate and some vanilla notes. Aside from the bourbon, this isn't so boozy in the nose as I thought it was going to be.
Taste: a sharp, alcohol burn is felt at the tip of my tongue. Then you have dark fruit soaked in alcohol, very rich chocolate, some coffee, strong vanilla and of course, bourbon. Hints of charred oak and a fairly sugary sweet taste as well. There's a lot going on here and each sip yields a little something new in complexity for me, but it is all well integrated. Its also not very boozy and doesn't drink as big as it is. I've had some other boozier stouts that came in at dramatically lower alcohol content! 
The strength of the flavors makes me very intrigued as to what its brother Chocolate Rain tastes like. I'm having a hard time imagining a more flavorful Black Tuesday.
I'm also glad that I split this one way and that we both ended up drinking about 13 oz of beer. I can't imagine being able to fully appreciate this one if I had a smaller sample or if I had to do the whole 750ml bottle by myself... mostly because the latter would probably kill me. 
Feel: sharp, alcohol burn at first but my mouth got used to it quickly. Full bodied but surprisingly not as viscous as I thought it was going to be but still quite full. Despite the alcohol content, this is pretty carbonated and is a little bit more carbonated than the really big Dogfish Head beers like World Wide Stout, Raison d'Extra and 120 Minute IPA (the only other beers coming in over 15% I've had), which is nice because it reminds me I'm drinking a beer. 
Drink: I honestly don't know how to rate this. Given the style, its a sipper even by the style's standards. If I had a small pour of this, I could see it disappearing quickly, which I think is where its high drinkability scores are coming from in other reviews. However, since I split the bottle with one other person, we both ended up with almost 13 ounces of the beer and well, having a glass full of Black Tuesday led to us taking about an hour to drink it, allowing us to savor it fully, and leaving us both a little buzzed at the end of it. What an amazing problem to have! 
That said, I am sure the brewer's intent isn't to make this a beer that you can slam back pint after pint of. But at the same time, the beer being so slow to drink meant that it kind of had the same effect as if we had several pints of a weaker brew during that time! 
Overall, this beer really surpassed expectations. I'm always skeptical of these super hyped beers and what's more hyped than Black Tuesday? Brewery only release, barrel aged, huge alcohol content, an imperial stout... basically meets all the criteria for an overhyped beer. Maybe it helped because I didn't seek it out specifically and it fell into my lap because of an exceedingly generous trader in mattolesh.
Regardless, my girlfriend and I decided it would be a good occasion to drink it to celebrate six months of dating after getting back together after a long hiatus. From the second I got the wax off and opened the bottle, I could smell the beer and was a little nervous, honestly. Pouring it out and beginning to drink it, well, I began to see what everyone else sees in this beer. Despite its size, its absolutely delicious. 
As a home brewer who is interested in high alcohol brewing (haven't done it yet, but its a long term goal for me), I am very impressed by the technical feat behind brewing this beer. 
But now I have a problem. I'm still new to trading, don't have anything exceedingly rare, and really want a Chocolate Rain. How do you improve Black Tuesday? I don't know how it can be done but apparently adding cacao nibs and vanilla bean helps. 
Well done, Bruery! You deserve much respect for this beer. Cheers! 4,916 charactersSkunkWorks, Feb 18, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is truly amazing! Shared from a bottle with brandoneast. The nose on this beer is so impressive it is indescribable. Huge chocolate, roast, bourbon oak up front. Taste is right on as well. If (and there is not)there was a downside to this beer it would be drinkability due to the high level of alcohol. The smell really boozed up after about an hour and I thought everything was cool. Then as I was laying in bed next to my wife she asks me to go close the blinds and I knew then that that beer was stronger than I expected. 
Almost over the top sweet and boozey but the mouthfeel and nose balance it out. 
Great beer overall and Patrick impresses me yet another time. 680 charactersjoshuacavett, Feb 17, 2011

Before i begin, this has been one of the best beers I've ever had. It pours a midnight chocolate with a beautiful inch-thick head. You can immediately smell the bourbon-barrel and chocolate/cocoa nibs. Also get some vanilla scent towards the back end. This thing tastes like Heaven. I immediately taste the dark fruit, chocolate and bourbon. Breathe while twirling the beer in your mouth and your palate will also pick up on some vanilla and slightt oak. Not too effervescent, and after every sip, I felt like an oil sheath of Black Tuesday was left on my tongue. In terms of drinkability, I would replace this with water if I could... 665 characterstrodersark, Feb 15, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -10.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42010 edition, split with friends and poured into a snifter
A: Dark, dark brown but not quite black as you can see through the edges of the glass. There was a 1 finger light brown head that faded quickly leaving about ½ a crown. The head had fairly poor retention, even for the style and there was no lacing.
S: There's bourbon up front, but light and nice. There's some etoh on the nose in the middle as well as a little caramel. To me this actually smells more like a bourbon barely barelywine than a stout. I think that's mostly due to the high ABV. There's also a strange lemon/ginger smell at the finish.
T: The main flavors here are licorice, some bourbon, and an aftertaste that consists of a little bourbon, a little booze and a smidgeon of toast and vanilla. As a side note, there were very little flavors of coffee, chocolate, caramel, maple, or other flavors typical of a stout.
M: First, I didn't think this was nearly as thick as it has been made out to be. With that being said it has a great mouthfeel and is on the thicker side as far as imperial stouts go.
D: Considering the extremely high ABV this one went down fairly easy, but with notable alcohol in the aftertaste. I would definitely have it again, but to be honest was a little under whelmed given the enormous amount of attention this beer gets. 1,325 charactersglazeman, Feb 13, 2011
4.41/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The story of Black Tuesday. When glazeman and I first started our journey into the world of BA, BT was on our radar. I remember when it was first released, the hype that followed, and how it made its way to the top of the BA top 100. I never thought I would get the chance to try this beer. When the second release (2010) gave people the opportunity to purchase BT online, we jumped at the opportunity. We each got a bottle, no thanks to the broke-ass internet connection at the Hines VA. As someone who repeatedly proclaims, "support your midwest brewers," especially in terms of big stouts, I really was hoping to dislike this beer. What can I say? It is outstanding. 
The appearance is nothing too special - tiny head that quickly fades - not a whole lot else going on. The smell is outstanding - booze, dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla. The taste is even better - vanilla, dark roasts, and an awesome chocolate after taste. Mouthfeel is also out of this world - just about as thick as Dark Lord. In general, this brew is very similar to DL, but a little bit less sweet, and obviously a lot more boozy vanilla. The drinkability is high, and the outrageous ABV is not even noticeable. I wish I had more of this. 
I got told by this beer. Period. I wanted to hate it, but it was amazing. My standard proclamation needs an addendum - "support your midwest breweries, but get your hands on some Black Tuesday." 1,407 charactersairohead2001, Feb 13, 2011

A: Super pitch black color with no light shining through. Pours like motor oil. Thick 2 inch dark mocha colored head that fades at a decent pace. Awesome.
S: One review I remember reading on this said it smelled like a chocolate brownie. That is the first thing that hits me. It's like an intense chocolate with a bready cake scent blended in. Some raisin and cocoa in the middle with some vanilla and booziness blended in the backend. Very good.
T: This one's super hot! I get a think bourbon burn upfront with some huge chocolate malts in the middle almost like chocolate syrup with hints of raisin and a breadiness on the backend. Very thick. This almost reminds me of a chocolate martini. Very good.
M: Super thick with a heavy carbonation. A hot creamy finish. Good.
D: Drinkability is not as high as some have led to believe. Good.
All in all, this is a great beer. Super thick and hot. Very chocolaty and delicious. If you like stouts, you definitely should try this at least once. If you don't like boozy brews, then this is not for you. 1,238 characterssteve8robin, Feb 12, 2011

Serving was a 2009 vintage. Appearance was very dark with an almost maroon-ish head which disappears quickly. Smell is of coarse a very strong bourbon highlight, dark chocolate, and dark fruits. Plumb maybe? As far a taste goes I'm blown away. considering we just had Kate previous to this, BT is a big step up. Strong bourbon taste, good amount of vanilla thrown in there. Chocolate is big in this, and a variety of darker fruits. Its very thick, motor oil thick. Nice hearty burn on the way down. This is by far the best stout i have ever encountered. 681 charactershenway, Feb 04, 2011
3.6/5  rDev -19.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 32009 version
A - poured reddish dark brown without much of a head
S - smelled very sweet - maple syrup and vanilla with molasses and a modicum of toasted malt. More sweet than anything.
T - Followed the nose perfectly. Opened up extremely sweet - loads of syrupy molasses and vanilla from the bourbon barrels. A lot of chocolate milk chocolate was blended in there as well. It ended very sweet, almost too sweet. I guess the sweetness is warranted for the huge ABV this thing packs. 
M - chewy mouthfeel to it with a full body. The booze was really well hidden.
D - this one was overly sweet to me. I felt like this was a huge beer, but the ABV just made it way sweeter than it needed to be. I can see why some people would really like this, but I think the couple glasses I had of it were way more than enough. The overly sweetness got to me after awhile. Good to try, but I wouldn't be disappointed if I never had it again.

2010 version - it seemed that molasses wasn't as prominent and this was not as sweet as the 2009 version, albeit it was still extremely sweet. 1,079 charactersbirchstick, Jan 31, 2011

A-Deep, dark, brutally black. Highlight? What's a highlight? A thin reddish tinged head quickly dissipates to a wisp of retention and leaves no lace whatsoever. Foam does reform with a bit of invigoration.
S-Fat dose of bourbon goodness up front with dry oak and sweet vanilla taking the center stage. Dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, eel sauce and dark cherries struggle to rise up out of the alcohol heat ooze.
T-Massive bourbon laden roasted malt, dark chocolate and dark fruit batter the palate with a non stop barrage of alcohol soak flavours. Massively complex with just so much going on it becomes hard to concentrate. 
M-Medium-heavy to almost chewy bodied with a strong alcohol burn and LONG lingering flavours.
D-For 18+% it is surely more drinkable than expected but it becomes tedious and uninteresting after awhile. I don't think I could ever drink an entire 750 ml bottle on my own without some money on the line. Good? Sure! Life altering, no! 1,139 charactersDeuane, Jan 29, 2011

Am I supposed to eat this, or drink this? Does this stuff go into my car? Is it safe to consume? This thing is pitch black with no head unless I give it swirl, and the beer coats the glass a little bit like wine instead of leaving actual lacing.
What the hell? The same questions I asked before come to mind when I smell this. Fire, chocolate and whiskey. Strange combo.
My nose is on fire. Maybe it's my throat. I can't tell, but it's hot. I can feel all of my nose hairs. They burn. If you could see my face, it would say "grimace." I'm pretty sure this wasn't meant for me to drink, but I can't seem to chew it either. What is it? I taste wood, whiskey, chocolate, molasses, dark fruits and loads of dark malt, but mostly I just taste alcohol. Burning, nose-hair-melting, fusel fire.
Mouthfeel: Chewing on a mildly spicy pepper?
This thing is unique and complex, but it's also a sticky, jumbled mess. I don't want to try this one again. 958 charactersHojaminbag, Jan 27, 2011

Reviewed from tasting notes. Bottle was 09
A: Syrupy and Dark mahogany as it pours. Black in the glass. Not a lot of head from the pour, but a gentle swirl gets a nice caramel head. 
S: Very rich and sweet. Vanilla, oak, and a hint of bourbon. It actually smells thick. Tons of caramel in this, as well as notes of brown sugar and molasses. 
T: A vanilla and caramel Explosion of sweetness. Dark and malty. The bourbon comes in the finish, with oak and a little more caramel sweetness. The booze is pretty well hidden in this monster. 
M: This explodes in your mouth with sweetness. Thick and syrupy. You can feel the booze more than you can taste it. Carbonation is good for the style. 
D: Sweet as hell, but man is this tasty. A sipper for sure, but complex and amazing. Damn, I see why Overlord drinks this everyday. 891 charactersBeejay, Jan 25, 2011

He'll never see this, but I must send a big thanks to my fiancée's uncle for picking up a few bottles for myself and friends and sending them back this way!
A - Pitch black in appearance but clear on the pour, this one comes out like motor oil. It produces a short-lived tan head with almost no lace. Sticky legs cling to the glass.
S - Strong alcohol aroma followed by wood and heavily roasted chocolate malts. Notes of coffee with fig, raisins, and slight pine hops on the swirl. Then again that could just be the pine-sol cleaning agent coming from the hot booze. It doesn't smell as thick and sweet as I remember it.
T - Sweet molasses and rich bittersweet chocolate with subtle coffee notes and barrel aroma. The bourbon doesn't come through as much as straight solvent alcohol like in the aroma.
M - Thick and syrupy-rich with a full body, this is the thickest beer I've ever had for sure. Hot alcohol is surprisingly mellow in it's perceived feel. Not too overbearing.
D - Definitely boozy overall and unbalanced toward sweetness but very good and different regardless. This begs to a) be sipped and b) be shared. I wouldn't open a bottle of this without at LEAST two other guys to share it with. 1,297 charactersBeerFMAndy, Jan 25, 2011

A - Definitely blacker than Monday with a burnt tan ring around the top of the glass. Oily and ominous. 
S - Although the bourbon is quite pronounced (no surprise there), the aroma is rounded out by chocolate, molasses, vanilla and a hint of soy sauce.
T - As with the aroma, the bourbon character dominates the initial flavor. Underneath all of the boozy warmth lies the true heart of Black Tuesday, though. Wood, chocolate, tobacco, vanilla and soy sauce all emerge to create a delicious flavor profile. While the bourbon presence is clearly over zealous, the alcohol remains fairly restrained for an 18% ABV beer.
M - Full bodied with an extremely oily, viscous texture and timid carbonation. While this is 18%, it drinks more in the 8-10% range. Mouthfeel is sticky and warm overall with a moderate alcohol burn in the finish. 
D - OK, the Bruery finally has my attention now. Full-bodied, complex and brimming with bourbon and vanilla goodness, Black Tuesday is a pretty amazing BBA Imperial Stout.

3.99/5  rDev -10.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to javib458 for sending this beast to me.
2009 vintage, 20 malts, son!
Pours pitch black and completely opaque without even the slightest hint of lighter color and a half finger dark mocha head that dissapears immediately. No lacing at all. 
Boozy bourbon aroma with hints of earthy oak and vanilla. slightly roasted chocolate malt as well as some hazelnut and toffee but the nose of this beer is all about the barrel. There's a nice vanilla marshmallow presence that cuts down the hot spirit character. Subtle soy sauce in the nose as well and the bourbon dominates but the malt presence becomes more evident as it warms.
Chewy medium body with a huge blast of bourbon that lingers troughout into a sweet, hot finish with plenty of warmth in the chest. Slightly viscous but a bit thinner than I expected based on the appearance. As it warms the silky chocolate malts become more apparent but overall this is kind of a one dimensional bourbon bomb. Faint hints of chocolate, toffee and licorice. Lots of alcohol sweetness and subtle soy spice flavor but this beer is actually pretty drinkable with a relatively well masked ABV. I would have never guessed that this was over 18%. 
Overall this beer is pretty tasty and easier drinking than expecting considering the ABV but it's a bit one dimensional and thinner bodied than I prefer for the style. 1,364 characterscorby112, Jan 24, 2011

A - A fair amount of carbonation bubbles for the ABV. Certainly worthy of it's black title.
S - Mildly diluted rubbing alcohol.
T - Sugary black licorice. Alcohol vaporizes in your nose as you sip. Lip lingeringly sweet. Boozey but not overwhelming.
M - Thick. Smooth. Very little carbonation.
D - Sip sip sip. Quickly becomes fatiguing.
Thanks to BeerFMAndy for sharing. 389 charactersbnieman, Jan 13, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a snifter while at Beechwood BBQ with a lot of Cali BAs after the Bruery Party. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, dark chocolate, and slight alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, alcohol, and maple syrup. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this brew was nothing short of excellent. Had a great flavor and aroma going on here that invited you to come back for more. This vintage was still a little hot, but still great. Massive thanks to the BA who shared this one (can't remember who it was but BM me if it was you and I will give you appropriate credit). Definitely glad I got to try this one! 800 charactersthagr81us, Jan 10, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52009 Vintage Poured into my Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary glass and shared with a friend.
This beer absolutely lives up to the hype and is worth seeking out by any means necessary. I have never had a beer at this high ABV (19.5%) and been able to detect very little of the booze. You do have to drink it slowly, because of how heavy it goes down and just for the purpose of enjoying every last sip. My friend and I both agree that this is like a fudge cake/brownie wrapped into one of the most unique and exceptional beers you can have of this style. It is without a doubt a special occasion beer and one worthy of that occasion. I think the year of age on it as well had some to do with the drinkability. 707 charactersmcgwire756, Jan 09, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into my Orval tulip.
This is a black as night beer with a small brown head that didn't leave any lacing. Smells of burnt char and nice chocolate. This drinks exceptionally smooth and well and awesomely drinkable for a 20% beer (this was the 2009 bottle).
I like this beer and would like to drink some more of it, but you really want to have someone around to help share it with as it will mess you up. 424 charactersRodneyX, Jan 03, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a dark black chocolate color, nice.
Smell is of brown sugar molasses, alcohol, chocolate, and roasted malts.
Taste is of alcohol, molasses, sweet caramel and toffee. Very big and complex stout, but the alcohol is very prevalent.
Medium carbonation, sweet, smooth, very boozy.
Sweet and boozy, good beer but the alcohol is really strong, but maybe that is to be expected from an 18.2% beer.
Overall a great beer, but not something you could ever drink an entire bottle of. 482 characterspmccallum86, Jan 02, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5This review is for the 2010 version.
After opening the bottle, it gushed slowly over the top and onto the counter top, eventually falling to the sheet vinyl flooring below. This was not expected, as the bottle's owner was away rinsing out his Hopmonk snifter, readying it for a splash of Black Tuesday to celebrate the New Year. After cleaning up the mess, a healthy pour was allocated to both the bottle's owner and compadre.
The beer sitting in front of me mirrored the night sky and seemed to reflect the chasm of the atmosphere overhead. It looked both still and alive in the same instance and seemed indifferent to the cold evening air.
In order to wash away the dinner smell of braised short ribs, I buried my nose in the glass. A wave of bourbon alcohol, warm fudge and mocha from Pete's coffee house greeted me. Another sniff revealed strong vanilla extract, spices, cinnamon and more bourbon. This is something that one could dive into and swim around for awhile, and a few laps are necessary.
A quick swig immediately made me aware of the high alcohol content and that 18.5% wasn't something that is quickly imbibed, but savored over an evening, which it was. Further sips revealed sherry, port, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, bourbon, a sweet brewers concoction of malt and sugar, all spice and a similar flavoring that reminded me of Melange 3, or vice versa as this was a component in that blend.
There was a cold front moving through the peninsula and a thick, wool blanket was needed to stay warm. The beer served as a secondary heater, heavy and viscous, helping to keep the cold night air at bay as it infiltrated the old single-pane windows. The minimal carbonation was appropriate for a beer of this style and seemed in tune with the Victorians that line the streets here in San Francisco, old but still relevant, almost flat but not quite yet. 
I think that 2011 will be a good year. And for a year that starts out with a glass of Black Tuesday, it has already eclipsed the previous year. 2,013 charactersJoeySchlitz, Jan 01, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.752009 Bottle: Poured into a Duvel tulip glass and was motor oil pitch black in color with a creamy 1 finger brown head that faded slowly and left decent lacing; wasn't sure what to expect after cutting off the wax, and this beer looked mean as it poured - like the heartless souls of Wall Street dumped into a glass. 
The aroma was all business and very impressive; starts off with a whiff of bourbon and then meanders into dark fruit like plum, dates and raisin, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, burnt grains, coffee grinds, brown sugar, toasted malt, vanilla, toffee and something else sweet which I can't put my finger on because the alcohol presence seems to come in waves. This defines the imperial stout aroma to me, as the bourbon barrel aging is so evident that this feels like an after dinner dink. This is super sweet and powerful in every sense, but yet somehow still alluring and pleasant to inhale. Exactly what I hoped for in the odor and I am psyched to have this bottle all to myself as this smells spectacular. 
Tastes like it smells, with bourbon, dark fruit like plum, dates and raisin, molasses, chocolate, vanilla, cocoa, burnt grains, coffee grinds, brown sugar, toasted malt, toffee, smoked/burnt wood, red wine, dates, and an overall sweetness that pushes your taste buds to the limit in a good way. The alcohol heat is evident and lets you know it's there, but somehow manages to blend in nicely with the bourbon and malt sweetness which is at an extreme level and took on some of the barrel woody notes. There might be some hops in here, but they are so overwhelmed that they were not present to me; the lack of hops didn't matter much as this flavor is so incredible it wouldn't matter what was used since this is so complex and tasty - wow, just a great beer. This flavor is for anyone who likes stouts, bourbon and getting fucked up. 
Mouthfeel is smooth and slick considering the ABV heat that burns as it goes down and then warms your insides in a peaceful manner; this is a chewy stout that has a heavy body and a real rich feel as the weighty ingredients make for a beer that is dynamic and robust, and gets you wasted all at the same time. 
Kept this for a year and then opened it today to enjoy it's earthly pleasures; slow sipper is an understatement, I nursed this bomber. Outstanding taste and beer experience, this was delicious and while it messed me up from the high ABV, I enjoyed each and every sip of this world class brew. I highly recommend this beer and advise everyone to grab a bottle if they can. 2,544 charactersCHickman, Jan 01, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Brought to the New Years Eve tasting by Bankhead. Greatly appreciated, Henry!
A: Straight black, topped with soft brown, shimmering head that holds on to all but a collar that maintains all the way down. 
S: Roasted malts, deep vanilla and woods, alcohol fusels, and some notes of saltiness and anise.
T: Big roasted malts, sweet coffee and loads of vanilla and creamy toffee. Very sweet, yet not at all cloying. The alcohol is very noticable, as expected, and manages to complement it very nicely. I didn't expect it to be so very well balanced and port-like. Strangely, I don't pick up on anise on the palate. Excellent.
M + D: Thick and rich, yet slick and smooth and easy to take back. Nice warming without being "hot" or otherwise boozy. Again, a well balanced big beer that I'm pleased to have tried 809 charactersProteus93, Dec 31, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I first tried this beer at DLD 2010, but was in no condition to remember enough for a review. I do remember it being very strong at the time... This week, I was lucky to try a pour of 2009 BT with a fresh palate, courtesy of Spycow (thanks Chris!). It was the first drink before a fairly large tasting, possibly not the best first choice what with the ABV, but one I pounced on.
This bottle was actually opened the previous night but was recorked in such a way that there was very good carbonation remaining. A nice audible when we pulled the wine stopper out. It poured dark black with a thin tan head (almost certainly diminished head versus drinking it the night before).
The aroma was much much better than my DLD recollection. Big bourbon notes and all sorts of delicious scents, vanilla and chocolate, rich roasted malts, some dark fruits, and very little alcohol (for a beer with &gt;18% ABV).
Everything comes through in the flavor, this beer is definitely as good as people say. It comes across as sweet but not cloying, and the bourbon is tasteful without being overbearing. You can tell it's got a decent kick if only from the slight burn, but really you don't taste the alcohol. All of the other flavors mask it very well.
Low carbonation, probably due to the way I had it, but it worked well and I thought it was a nice creamy match for the flavors. The only real negative is the packaging, this type of beer should be sold in smaller bottles. I would never want to open it without a small crowd. Excellent. 1,524 charactersTurdFurgison, Dec 30, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle. 2010 version. Oh, the fabled and mythical BT!
Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown with slight reddish brown highlight on the rim. The head is very slight and forms a tan head around the collar of the glass. The aroma is very boozy with notes of molasses, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, and toffee. The alcohol burns the nose as you inhale a deep breath. The taste is sweet with hints of bourbon, dark roast, chocolate, and booze. The booze somewhat overpowers this and I kind of wish it was dialed down a tad but that being said, for the abv this is pretty smooth drinking. Warms as you drink this beer. No lace but it has legs for gods sake! Medium/heavy mouthfeel. This beer is pretty sweet flavor wise. For being such a high abv beer it really is decent but given the choice on an everyday basis, I would rather have a lower abv imperial stout. 861 characterskbutler1, Dec 29, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Thanks Hophead101 for breaking this out during the epic tasting! The Holy Grail or RIS ?? I'd say so...
Appearance:
Upon popping the cap and cutting the wax off the neck there was a decent amount of carbonation gasses that cam from the large bottle. On the pour this baby comes out jet black like 10W-30 motor oil and will not let any amount of light pass through it. I was left with a dark dark chocolate colored head that was maybe a half an inch thick and slowly dissipated as I sipped away. When I give a little swirl there is a massive amount of lacing going on here , it seems to stain the glass deep red like iodine and crawls ever so slowly down the walls.
Smell:
Wow, huge bouquet of black chocolate, figs, dark whiskey soaked cherries, heat alcohol, cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, oak tannins and even some Raisin Bran. There is just a load of aromas going on here that you almost have to try to believe very complex.
Taste:
Man, does it get better than this ? I'm going with one of the best RIS I ever had. Surprisingly very smooth and the alcohol is hidden very well. Figs, cream, cocoa whiskey, sharp barrel notes, warming alcohol some ash and meaty tones. I cant get over how easy this drinks which is very dangerous. Very sweet molasses, and vanilla round out this robust ale.
Drinkability:
Lets be real here, your not going to pound a 16oz glass of this but damn would I love to try. This is very slow sipping and isn't for the faint of heart so its drinkability is a little lower but still makes for a epic tasting ale. 1,538 charactersBmoyer0301, Dec 29, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5First off, many thanks go to the BA now known as IronKrausen for hooking me up with this beer. He will be mentioned again in a future review involving a 5 year vertical of another great beer. More on that another day...
I'm not sure if I've ever told this story here before, but shortly before moving out to Portland back in May of this year, I put out an "In Person" trade request for Sierra Nevada Ken & Fritz's Ale. It didn't make it to the bottle shop I frequented in North Georgia, so it was definitely a want. MADhombrewer answered my post and we set up a meeting for some pints and the swap at Don Younger's fantastic Horse Brass Pub when I got to Portland. That initial trade has led to our friendship and more than a few bottles opened at each other's houses. Black Tuesday was the last bottle opened at our most night of "bottle popping". It was shared with my wife "TulipSnifter" and his wife-to-be "WitchesBrew". Nine bombers averaging about 8%-9% ABV were opened prior to this one so I was quite surprised to find glorious well written notes and scores typed into the memo pad section of my BlackBerry the next morning when I woke up at 10am with a splitting freaking headache. Onto the review now that the back story is out of the way. Very little embellishing has been added to these "real time" notes.
A: Poured into a stemless crystal Reidel brandy snifter, Black Tuesday appears sinister enough to propel the American economy into flat out bankruptcy. The super thick viscosity of the pour glugs into my glass to reveal a bottomless gash in the earth inky blackness with deep brown heartland soil edges. The very light fizzy walnut head dissipates quickly to reveal just a glass ring of bubbles. Swirling allows the liquid to creep up the sides of the glass and descend back to the body in legs. 4.5/5
S: Holy Hammer of Thor is this thing extreme! Without a doubt this is the most alcohol-centric beer I have ever smelled! Other Barrel Aged Imperial Stouts I have had like to showcase the barrel but this is a Rockette high kick to the olfactory's! I don't think I have to worry about my nose hairs for a while because they all just got singed off. The wonderful sweet Bourbon just dances everywhere. Black pepper spice, white pepper heat, and cinnamon warmth just dance a jig that I can't get enough of. My new standard for what -BAL stout should be. 5/5
T: Another wow to add to the list of previous tasters. If the aroma wasn't wild enough, this roller coaster ride of a beer just went for a double loop. Does this taste like what I expected 18% to be? Not even close! Sweet milk chocolate, sweet dates, sweet brown sugar, sweet caramel, sweet bourbon, and sweet cinnamon candies are all along for the cork screw turn on the track. I LOVE an overly sweet boozy beer and this fits the bill to a "T". 5/5
M: My Tongue is literally numb. It's definitely on the medium-low carbonated side but it's just so luxurious and smooth those bubbles may not even be needed. Take them away all together and you have something resembling Cognac. That is not a problem in my book. Despite the super-hero sized dessert sweetness in the taste, this actually finishes a little cleaner than I expected. 4.5/5
D: The next bottle of Black Tuesday I get is going to be opened by me and me alone! Seriously though, it's a beer that I could drink by myself should I really want to but would best be shared with others so its magnificence can be talked about. Saying "wow that shit is good" doesn't quite have the same impact when tucked away in a man-cave by one's self. Get a few other people to share a bottle with or they won't believe your fabled stories of Black Tuesday! 5/5
I actually looked into airplane tickets to attend the brewery release this year. At the time I thought it may not be worth it after adding up all the costs. Hopefully Patrick Rue can make a few more bottles of this for next year and maintain this level of quality because I will be trying like crazy to get tickets for the 2011 party. If I manage to do so, I don't expect to be the only new face there. This never was a secret to faithful local patrons of The Bruery and now I'm very much in the know as well. I hope to see everybody there next year! 4,234 charactershopsbreath, Dec 25, 2010

Big thanks to VDubb86 for sharing his winnings with me!
And the elusive Black Tuesday sits in my glass. Nice. it pours a straight obsidian topped by a half-finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises rich bourbon, chocolate syrup, roasted malts, molasses, and oak. Smells like the hype might ring true. The taste, though, ensures that it does not. The bourbon is far too hot, the chocolate is just a step too sweet, and these combined with a hefty dose of roasted malts produce an unnerving prickle on the tongue. It's clear there was a damn good idea in place for this beer, but it doesn't seem as though it was carried out very well. Perhaps some age would have done it some good, but I'm not sure I'll find that out. As it stands, the flavors are just too all over the place to work properly. The body is a hefty-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a semi-chewy feel. Overall, though disappointing, I was very glad to have been able to try this brew. I can see why many would love it, but it's just not working for me. 1,060 charactersTMoney2591, Dec 25, 2010

Thanks to hayesez for this beer from the Beer Name Puzzle LIF!!!
This beer pours a decently black brown with a little bit of beige head up front. This beer is nice and bourbon and fruity esters on the nose. The oak flavor mixed with caramel and brown sugar work really well with this. I'm truly enjoying this beer, I wish I had the willpower to have aged this at least a year because the high ABV is still running a little hot. I still have no problem enjoying this beer and drinking it with my many friends. 530 charactersVdubb86, Dec 24, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750mL bottle poured into a snifter. Huge thanks to cjacobsen for the generosity in sharing!
(A)- Pours fairly thick and pitch black. Produced a relatively low tan head but with this high a ABV, I was surprised there even was a head.
(S)- Rich as can be. Plenty of roasted components with lots of licorice and raisin. Some cocoa and molasses too. A bit of boozy heat but not as bad as I was expecting.
(T)- Very similar to the smell, only much much more restrained. Very very sweet with some dark fruits. Plenty of raisins in there. This got alot better once it warmed up some more; some nice cocoa and smooth caramel came through.
(M)- A good carbonation level and a decent balance. Very very sweet; almost borderline sugary. Would have liked to see more of the roasted components from the smell come through in the taste. This is seriously sweet. Superb ABV integration though for a massive 18.2%. This is smoother and easier on the palate than some 10-13% beers I can think of.
(D)- A sipper if there ever was one, however a tasty one at that. Extremely rich and sweet, but bringing it to a warmer temperature helped that out a bit. Glad to have finally tried this, but it is not worth giving your firstborn child for. It is very good mind you, but not THAT good to require you trading away your prized beers from your cellar to acquire. 1,344 characterssweemzander, Dec 21, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a deep, opaque black. Stone colored head that diminishes to a few bubbles around the edge of the glass.
Smells of heavy licorice. Some raisin. It hits you very hard right up front. A lot going on and very rich and heavy, a bit of a roasted scent. Bitter dark chocolate, cocoa smell.
Tastes sweet. A lot of dark fruit, blackberries, licorice. A lingering hazelnut aftertaste in there at the end. The alcohol is extremely masked which is an incredible surprise. As it warms, caramel and chocolate notes seem to seep through and become more prevalent.
Surprisingly smooth for the heftiness of the brew and the onslaught of smell and flavor. The carbonation has slight bite to it, but its not too bad and balanced by the malt load.
The drinkability is low due to the fact that you can't have very many of these. It's so rich and heavy in alcohol. It's quite the treat but a doozy. 886 characterscjacobsen, Dec 21, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5A big thanks to Dreadnaught33 for procuring this bottle from a friend and allowing some of us to try it! I got a generous 4-5 oz. pour off the bat into a Bruery snifter.
A: Pours very black fluid (this beer isn't unbelievably black, it's just mostly black) with slight mahogany brown highlights around the edges. A light tan cap appears briefly but dissipates quickly to a thin ring. Handsome presentation indeed!
S: The smell is very powerful and forced me to bellow in delight as I took a whiff! Big bourbon notes coupled with vanilla and oak woodiness support a malt aroma of dark caramel and chocolate. I am getting very little, if any, roastiness from this. It is mostly a sweeter style. There is a slight unexpected tinge of teriyaki as we discussed at the table.
T: Molasses, Grade C maple syrup, chocolate malts all come to mind in this big flavored beer. The bourbon is present but not intrusive. Vanilla and Oak notes compliment the flavor nicely. Again, no roastiness available which is somewhat disappointing to me. The teriyaki is also somewhat of a distraction. Medium alcohol heat is present in the finish.
M: Full bodied beer representative of the style with a slightly slick mouthfeel. It is probably very dextrinous. Medium sweet finish.
D: For most part the beer is fairly drinkable at 18+% ABV. Pleasant flavors abound however, the beer is fairly sweet, not quite cloying, but getting there. The alcohol in the finish is also somewhat of a turn off.
This is a great beer, but I think it is over-hyped. It would probably be in my top-10 of stouts, but not top 5. 1,587 charactersahalloin, Dec 17, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I was extremely fortunate to have been given this bottle as a gift from Thor, the beer manager at Brasserie Beck at dinner last night. A really nice review will be coming after this Black Tuesday review for Brasserie Beck as I've had many good experiences there and is worth a try if in DC. 
This beer is my 100th review, as I tried to plan it out that way since this is a beer that I've really really wanted to try since I got a taste (well maybe 4-5 tastes) of it at GABF 2010. It's really a great beer, though age will help the heat on this one. 
A: Pours like motor oil super dark brown to black with a khaki head and some lacing. Was expecting complete darkness but it still looks great.
S: Awesomely complex, wow! Bourbon, definite sweet/heat of alcohol, lots of chocolate, vanilla, oak, sugary malt, leather, and more. AWESOME! I could not get my nose out of the glass. Such a present and huge aroma.
T: Taste does not disappoint. The smell and more! The other flavors I got besides the vanilla, bourbon, oak, malt etc. from the smell is an added salty teriyaki (that I get in Dark Lord as well) with other additions of candied dark fruits, chocolate milk, hot chocolate cake, a healthy does of molasses, coffee and some kinds of spicy hot sauce-ish notes (I like that a lot!). I love how ever next sip you get something different, almost like if you think of a different flavor to concentrate on you'll get that next time you sip. What an awesome flavor. Lives up to the hype for me.
M: Really viscous and coating, just what you'd want, although the alcohol heat prevents me from giving this a five. It needs some time to cool down and this will be perfect because I just love the carbonation level and the thickness of it now!
D: What a tasty brew. With time this will probably be a five for me also, if only I can get someone to trade me one of these! I've tried trading lots of stuff for this on here already and honestly I'm glad I never went all out to get one, as it is great great beer but not one to give all you have for. I'm so fortunate that I could get hooked up with this last night, it's a great brew! I may be planning to go to the release next year if I can! 2,188 charactersDreadnaught33, Dec 17, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From 12/12/10 notes. Got to try this at a local tasting thanks to drabmuh. Big thanks Matt, this was my biggest want!
a - Pours a jet black color with two to three inches of fluffy tan head that stays throughout drinking and light carbonation evident. Leaves a tiny bit of lacing on the glass, looks perfect.
s - Smells of bourbon, oak, chocolate, roasted malts, dark fruit, and vanilla. Also a little sweet brown sugar or molasses. Very enjoyable; it's complex and balanced.
t - Tastes of bourbon, oak, chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, and molasses. Also a little bit of raisin or dark fruit. Taste is a bit hot but still great to me, as I love bourbon.
m - Medium to full body and low carbonation. The body is really smooth and creamy and the ABV is very well hidden. It I didn't know this was 18-19% ABV, I would have guessed it was 9%. Love the mouthfeel.
d - Overall I thought this was an amazing beer; one of the best barrel aged stouts I've ever had. While this beer is super hyped and I have been disappointed with some of their hyped beers in the past, this one lived up to the hype. I think it looks and smells great, and has a wonderful mouthfeel, but is a tiny bit hot. I think in 6-12 months this could be even better, if the heat dies down a tiny bit. Either way, if you like bourbon barrel aged stouts you'll still love this one now. Would love to get another bottle of this. 1,397 charactersmdfb79, Dec 16, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Captured in a recent trade, big thank you here.
A-Death black as it poured out with a very heavy body to it, very thick looking. I gave it a good hard pour to see if a head would develop at all, minimal head did develop and it disappeared quickly leaveing a ring around the edge of the glass. 
S-Very different than any other BB aged stout i have had before, the bourbon was very mild with a heavy chocolate cake sweetness. Overall i am very impressed how this does not smell like alcohol at all at 18.2%
T-Should be a 6 for just how much flavor this has!! I have NEVER had a beer stick to my tongue and mouth like this did, i could taste it for what seemed like 15 minutes in my mouth (this grossed out the wife when she tried) after a small sip. The best part here is it still was very balanced with a TON of different flavors destroying my tastebuds.
M-THICK and RICH, coates your mouth like no other beer can or could!!!
D-For 18.2% i would say pretty damn good.
Overall this beer has always had a ton of hype and i can tell you that it has exceeded all of my expectations, this probably was one of the most epic beer moments for me. I can say one thing for sure and that is "I will be at the next release of this beer". 1,230 charactersJWD, Dec 12, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Shared a bottle with some fellow BAs.
Pitch black pour with a dark tan head poured into a chalice. Sticks all over the glass I swirl it around. Deep roasty, fudgy, chocolate, and sherry aroma. Some molasses and burnt sugar there as well. Flavor follows the nose. Dark cocoa bar with a sweet bourbony/brown sugar backbone. Roast takes a back seat to the sweet stout flavors. Great thick body, sticks around long after the beer is gone. Unbeleivably drinkable - the 19.5% ABV is incredibly well hidden (compared to other high ABV stouts / strong ales that I have had). Totally lived up to the hype, very happy I got to try this. 627 charactersmuttyd, Dec 06, 2010
3.82/5  rDev -14.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.52010 vintage. Kindly trucked up by Official Bruery Mule, womencantsail. Thanks Andrew. 
A: Pours a pitch, opaque black. One finger of dark mocha head. It retains poorly, but it does leave curtains during sips. 
S: Sherry jumps out at me immediately. This is well oxidized, but in a good way. Molasses, brown sugar. Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak are milder. There is noticeable booze in the nose. 
T: A strong, almost treacly sherry flavor to it; it reminds me of the strong raisin character of DFH World Wide Stout. But this is much less harsh. Other sweet flavors of molasses, brown sugar, caramel, and dark fruits jump out at me. Plenty of chocolate and vanilla. The finish is more bourbon than oak, and it lingers deliciously into the aftertaste. Not particularly complex as far as barrel-aged imperial stouts go, but it's thick, heavy, dessert-like, and appreciable by laymen. Definitely good virtues to have. 
M: It is closer to medium-bodied this year vs. last year; it seems to be drier on the whole. That seems to make it feel a lot hotter than the '09, too. But it's restrained for something that's estimated to be almost 20%. 
D: My second time having this. I like it enough, but I'm not a big fan. It's overall too sweet and too 'big', and my palate is too overwhelmed to pick out the nuances. Still, $30 is a decent price point for one or two bottles, because the beer goes over very well with my family. It makes the centerpiece of a nice tasting; beer nerd and layman alike enjoy it. The primary value of this beer (to me) is not in drinking it alone or even trading it, but in using it to convert beer neophytes. The Bruery fills that niche very well. 1,674 charactersArbitrator, Dec 04, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a very dark brown, looks black in the glass and is completley opaque and very thick, although on the pour it was not black. Generates an inch or so of beige head, although it's not super thick and keeps only a thin lace without much stick.
Smell is incredibly rich, with dark, fudgy chocolate, roasted malt, black currant and other dark fruits, and lots of enticing bourbon character. It's got lots of vanilla and has a leathery quality to it as well. I do get some booze but I'm neither surprised nor bothered by that given the strength of this beer. So bold and rich, with layers of complexity; really fantastic.
Taste is pretty much every bit as complex and enjoyable but in this case the alcohol heat is just slightly bothersome. Leaves a bit of a burn in the back of the throat, but this still tastes exceptional. It's rich and chocolaty, dark chocolate and fudge, with cocoa and some coffee, roasted malt and molasses. The bourbon is nice and gives some vanilla and oaky flavor. As mentioned previously it's pretty boozy and there is some heat left in the finish. Really tasty stuff.
Mouthfeel is a very creamy full body, super rich and dense, pretty smooth as well except for the burn in the finish. Soft carbonation allows you to swirl it in the mouth and take it all in.
I had this once last year and was lucky enough to score a bottle again this year, and it really is an exceptional beer. Definitely one that lives up to the hype. A great beer to enjoy slowly and with company on a cool evening. 1,516 charactersnumber1bum, Nov 28, 2010

appearance 5.0- This beer looks like whats a stout should look like. very dark rich colors with a microscopic tan colored head. almost looks like liquid luxury chocolate if u could imagine!
smell 5.0- exceptional smell from the glass. has a very unique smell that could not be match be any other beer in the world. strong smells of a special type of chocolate and almost a light smell of a chocolate cherry liqour with the barrel smell infused into it. so much more smells i cannot really explain just pure heaven.
taste 5.0- the taste and the abv of 18% can be instantly taste in the mouth. it flows ever so freely with almost of a burst of a million flavors in your mouth. after taking a gulp u can feel sensations still tingling through out your mouth. just overall great.
mouthfeel 5.0- like i kinda touched on in the last catagory very orgasmic in your mouth the feel is just unreal in how it feels in your mouth. cant put it in words for such a great tasting beverage
drinkability 4.5- i would only like to say that i didnt give it a 5.0 because of how strong the the abv is for a beer. so i dont want people to think this is a negitive 4.5..its just my thoughts...whould def have to agree with my best man that this is by far the best stout i have ever have and i would take alot for one to beat it 1,343 charactersjimmyjgo, Nov 13, 2010

It pours a deep seducing black, with a carmel head that dissipates gracefully. Once you pop the wax cap off, the enormous aromas fill the room, at times too strong for the weak of nose. Bringing your face closer to the glass, your nostrils are filled with the thick aromas of chocolate, coffee, caramel and vanilla. The bourbon barrel aging makes it's appearance here, but it's not until the first sip that you can tell how long it has been sitting there. The Bourbon is strong, but smooth. At 18.2% the alcohol is definitely present, but it glides across your palate effortlessly. The sweetness is incomparable. Like a rich brownie, I find myself struggling to lift it to my lips, but the notion of how good it tastes keeps me trucking through. I'm mortified to see how this will age. My favorite stout by far! 922 characterspnkRed, Nov 13, 2010

A: Dark, black syrup with thin skin of mocha on the surface. Great legs when swirled. Appears very thick.
A: Cocoa, bourbon, dark fruits, dark brown sugar, slight molasses. Very inviting.
T: Yep, as it smelled. Vanilla, chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon and dark fruits. Alcohol surprisingly not really noticeable. Damn... this is good. 
M: One of the richest beers I've experienced. Heavy viscosity that coats the tongue. Light carbonation leads to smooth feel. Amazingly not boozy given high ABV.
D: Thick, delicious and smooth, however a couple of half pours is about all one needs to completely enjoy this amazing beverage. This is definitely one to be shared with friends. 694 charactersMooch273, Nov 09, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Stephen Johnson for sharing this at the New Brew Thursday 1 year anniversary.
It poured a dark black with a tan head. The smell was surprising, not as hot as I thought it would be, sweet chocolate, bourbon, vanilla. The flavor pretty much followed suit, very sweet chocolate, some bourbon and vanilla, surprisingly little alcohol flavor for the abv. Mouthfeel was surprisingly light for such a big beer, I'd say it's a smooth, lightly carbonated, medium body.
I'd say this is more of a dessert beer. It drinks very nice but don't think you can finish a bottle by yourself. 584 charactersZX6Chris, Nov 08, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Dark, dark brown, almost black. The smell is pure sweetness. The taste is syrupy sweet and complex. Surprisingly little alcohol taste for a beer of this ABV but after drinking I definitely get the warm mouthfeel that lets me know there was a lot of alcohol in there. The most amazing thing about this beer though is the way it coats the tongue. This is like beer concentrate, it coats the tongue like an oily syrup. This beer is a truly amazing experience. For a beer of this ABV it is amazingly drinkable. The sweetness is a bit much, I don't know that I could drink a pint of it but it would be wonderful served in a snifter or tulip glass as an after dinner drink. 667 charactersaknight, Nov 06, 2010

A - Clear deep dark brown with a small thinly formed head, basically a ring around the glass. Little lacing.
S- Lots of bitter chocolate, vanilla, maple syrup-like notes. Bourbon and pleasant boozy alcohol. 
F/M - Again, bitter chocolate, roast, vanilla, bourbon. Very nice alcohol warmth and slight alcoholic bitterness helps this beer finish very smoothly. Sweet, rich, full bodied, oily and slick. Moderately low carbonation. Lingering chocolate flavor.
D- This is such a delicious beer. Smooth and rich. Full bodied and quite filling, yet I want to drink more. 600 charactersdomtronzero, Oct 29, 2010

S - Tasty. Like walking into your favorite pizza shop, and falling in love again and again (however 2010 seems a bit stronger). Not overpowering to not want to try.
T - Delcious. Very well hidden, but at the same timestrong alcohol flavor. 
M -Thick. Wants to linger. While sipping, you want it to last. Definitely not hot.
D - Huge. Couldn't even imagine drinking an entire bottle, but a glass with a few friends and some light cheese, it's very easy. 534 charactersporkinator, Oct 28, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Ahh Black Tuesday, we finally meet. And under such wonderful circumstances! I have heard about your lusciousness, dare I say delectableness countless times on the forum and from word of mouth. While I understand you have "gotten around" since last year, this is of no matter to me. Alas, it was finally my time to try you...
Appearance - Poured by an absolutely stand up cheery fellow dressed in 1920's garb behind the counter at the BT release party, into my brand new Bruery Tulip. The color is an utter midnight black, with no light even daring to try and penetrate through such an opaque mass. Just a hint of dark mocha colored head is given in this overly generous pour. Despite not much head, the glass was thoroughly coated with thin lacing once I was done with it.
Smell - I stood there next to fellow BA's, and was entranced by the aroma. Unbelievable sweetness in the nose with cocoa, roasted malt, bourbon, slight vanilla, and some dark fruits. I swirled the beer in my glass numerous times in order to take in my first BT experience.
Taste - As I raise my quivering glass up to my mouth to take my first sip, everything suddenly slows down. My eyes dart around the room, looking at the other BA's to see if they too were experiencing this phenomenon; it appears they were not. I feel like I am immersed in a world that is still. To my left a BA is frozen in time, about to open a Black Ops 08. To my right there is an individual looking at the list of beers he is wanting to try. And straight ahead is a girl that appears to be the person in Irishgurl4's avitar but we all know that said account is fake and is in reality a 50 year old male. Befuddled, I continue with my first sip, savoring this great tick...err beer. And then "poof", the room around me once again comes back to life, as if someone flipped a switch. The initial taste yields a nice bourbon flavor, though nothing that would make you wince. The alcohol is masked surprisingly well, behind flavors quiet similar to the nose. Bourbon, vanilla, cocoa, and some plum. Quite sweet, but not cloying. A beer that honestly lives up to at least "some" of the hype. Very very delicious.
Mouthfeel - All I can say is that I had this BT, then after did a bottle share with a Short's 2009 Anniversary Wheat Wine which by itself has a relatively heavy feel. It felt like water after having the BT. Great viscosity, low carbonation (duh), and a definite dry finish.
Drinkability - The few ounces I had dissipated relatively fast given the alcohol content. I did not taste alcohol in the beer, though I did feel its warming effects. A very enjoyable beer and I am glad I was able to make my way with it. I will look for you again soon, my Black Tuesday gal. 2,726 charactersSpdKilz, Oct 28, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - 2009 vintage. It pours pitch black with a small medium tan head that quickly recedes, leaving no lacing.
S - The bourbon presence is strong. It also has a lot of sweetness. There is also light vanilla and woody notes.
M - Full in body. Pretty thick with very light carbonation. 
T - It's very sweet up front with chocolate, and molasses. It finishes with strong bourbon notes, light vanilla, and oak. There is a strong alcohol presence, which is to be expected. 
This is a huge beer, I'm glad I got a chance to try it. If you like bourbon this beer is for you. Even though I enjoyed it, I don't think I would seek this beer out again. It's not bad, just way to strong. Took forever to finish it. 703 charactersboralyl, Oct 24, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sampled at GABF on 9/18/2010. This Imperial Stout pours a deep black color from the tap. Medium sized tan foamy head. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla and woody with some alcohol. A full bodied Imperial Stout. A VERY BIG Imperial Stout. The malts are chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, some bourbon and some cherry. The hops are herbal. This beer has a big alcohol presence, I mean a whole lot of alcohol, the first sip and smell are dominated by the alcohol, after that the other flavors start coming through. There is a nice mix of malts, sweetness, vanilla and wood going on here, once you get past the big alcohol blast. This beer has an awesome potential for aging. It is very good now, but a couple or five years of bottle aging would make this beer even more amazing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. 881 charactersbeerguy101, Oct 19, 2010

You pour the deepest black with a charcoal head that crowns you for ages, clinging to the sides of my tulip, coating my glass in alcohol as I tilt it. You smell of chocolate covered cherries, sherry, sizzling burnt brown sugar, the aroma touching my nostrils like a solid. You taste of Zeus's nectar, candied cherries, port wine filled Belgian chocolate, tingling umami and a finish of the finest sherry. Your alcohol touches me, causing exaltation, erotic in sensation yet questioning in just how smooth you are. You animal. You chewy, oily, full bodied beast. You coat my palate and touch my throat nearly erotically in your thickness. You satisfy me. You touch my lips, my tongue, my throat, and my soul; your drinkability is spiritual. Your flavor is robust and gorgeous, you defy expectations for the umpteenth time. I love you. 897 charactersvacax, Oct 18, 2010
2.75/5  rDev -38.5%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2[Bottle] shared by tytoanderso. Pours a not very viscous looking black with a quickly dissipating tan head. Aroma is very sweet, and I actually get some cabernet sauvignon, touch of smokiness, oddly a touch of tartness, strong alcohol, chocolate, light soy sauce, and, of course, alcohol. Ungodly sweet, but the alcohol manages to dilute it a little bit, kind of tastes like syrup without the thick gooey texture, amazing alcohol presence, roasted malt, not too much else. Really lacks the complexity that something like the Hunapu's has and the subtlety that the Narke has. 574 charactersMatSciGuy, Oct 18, 2010
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Grotesque thanks to bankhead for trading me a bottle of the first batch of Black Tuesday when it first arrived, mewling & blind, into the world, commanding unworldly trade ransoms. 'head dealt this for a reasonable amount, for which I am greatly thankful. Popped open with the wife...was saving this for a Twins World Series win, but that'll have to wait now. And I'm thirsty. 
Pours black as rain. Smell is intense. The beer is galoshing about in bourbon, with the thickness of molasses, chocolate, malts deeper than the Bridge of Khazad-dum. Impressive. One of the better smelling beers I can recall. 
Black Tuesday came into the world with hype & I stand ready to fight back with the electronic word, but hey, it's not bad. There's a blender worth of identifying characteristics: bourbon, roasted bourbon, heaping spoonfuls of black sugar cane, weathered oak, lash of alcohol, with smatterings of applause, chocolate, real maple syrup, unidentified dark fruits, vanilla. Wow. I could sip & sip & keep finding more things but screw that, I'm done, just going to enjoy it from here on out. 
Rolls out of the Cigar City snifter as thick as the high ABV promises. The low carbonation seems appropriate for this dark creature, & each sip feels like a velvet finger easing into my throat. Smoooth. Reminds me of sipping a high-end glass of alcohol without the accompanying burn. Although there's a little of that. The alcohol is present & shouting from the rooftops. 
Well, damn. This is an excellent, excellent brew that I'm going to be sipping for a good hour or more. Memorable, & worth the effort of seeking out. 1,617 charactersmaximum12, Oct 18, 2010

A: Blacker than the blackest color of black that you can imagine. Imagine that? However, this one retains a gentle tan head (with brown notes) throughout the session.
S: Hello bourbon bomb! This also has a generous layer of dark candy sweetness.
T: Very unique taste with a strong burnt, caramel-pecan brittle body, surrounded by high grade dark chocolate dipped in oak and molasses. This is honestly better than any dessert I have ever tasted.
M: The bourbon doesn't act as a booze agent to enhance people's happiness (although it does that too), but as an integral and necessary ingredient in the whole concoction. It plays roughly the same role that honey plays in a dessert like baklava. I can't believe how smooth this is for the a brew clocking in at almost 20% ABV!
D: I wonder if I will ever get to try this again? The only way I see how is if my work schedule would allow me to take time off to fly to Cali and get some on that day. Or....I could just wait for my friend to score another bottle. I'm still in awe of this amazing brew and of the fact that I got a very generous sample of it! 1,307 charactersChaney, Oct 06, 2010

A: Deep, opaque black. There is a moderately small beige that hangs out for a few minutes before sinking into the abyss and disappearing forever. 
S: Bourbon! Whoa! There is nothing subtle about the aroma. It's enticing and alluring, but I must say that is predominantly bourbon. 
T: Black Tuesday tastes fantastic. Plain and simple. It's incredibly rich and buttery smooth. It's like a heavy freight train loaded with rich, roasted malt loaded and bourbon barrels on a collision course with your palate. I didn't find it to be complex, per se, as the enormous bourbon flavors overtake some of the more subtle aspects.
M: Extremely viscous, rich and thick. Alcohol content disguised masterfully. This isn't to say alcohol is not detectable, but I would never have guessed that it's nearly 20% abv. Very impressive.
D: While it definitely seems like a strong beer, I am amazed that it weighs in at 19.5% abv. That's insane. I had 6-8 ounces and thoroughly enjoyed every sip. Highly recommended. 1,069 charactersHuhzubendah, Oct 04, 2010

S: It smelled huge and complex like strong sweet chocolate and fig and super rich balsamic and brown sugar and alcohol, with oak and smoke and caramel.
T: It tasted incredibly bold and sickeningly sweet like caramel and rich chocolate with roasted coffee and vanilla and oak and fig/raisin, with some balsamic and brown sugar and flat Coca Cola. The aftertaste was cloyingly sweet with lots of alcohol.
M: It was syrupy thick with a bit of carbonation - almost like sludge.
D: This is one of the richest, boldest, and most complex beers I've had. On par with Utopias, but a stout instead of a barleywine. The scent and taste and body were all nearly overpowering. The alcohol was clearly present also, so it must be sipped, but it was so delicious. Just 3 ounces is more than enough for a serving, but that little bit can be savored for a long time. Fantastic brew that meets the hype. 947 charactersPencible, Sep 27, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Several samples on tap at the GABF. Late in the night when they stopped serving this I spotted a wasted volunteer (in a sombrero) just pouring himself glass after glass of this and slamming it. I am 100% sure he had no idea what he was drinking. Priceless.
App- Black as night. Motor oil in a glass with a thick brown head. Beautiful.
SM- Bourbon, espresso, vanilla, chocolate. Very sweet.
Ta- Very similar to the smell, but with some heat. Have to say people overdo the heat aspect in their reviews. Had I not know the ABV, I would have guessed this was ~9%. The oakiness really plays nice with all the other flavors.
MF- The super subtle carbonation cuts the sweetness beautifully. You keep tasting this long after you are done.
DR- A beautiful sipper. 
I don't know if any beer deserves the hype that this one has gotten, but it sure does it's best. Great beer. 870 charactersgueuzer, Sep 20, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Got this beer at the Great Amercian Beer Fest multiple times. 
Pours deep space dark black with a caramel head that disolves quickly.
Smells extremely intense and complex. Nots of caramel, dark fruits are very heavy and range from dates to bing cherrys and apricots. Chocolate and coffee round out the nose with a boozy undertone and essences of vanilla and charred wood and roasted marshmellow. Rich orange marmelade and maple even follow through.
Taste is more intense than the smell. Thick, fudge like mocha sweetness with a huge raisen and dark fruit character found more often in barleywines. Honey notes and slight vanilla hints turn up at the end with a good constantly growing alcohol warmth.
I love the complexity of this beer and it's very heavy indeed so go slow. The mouthfeel is moderately heavy but the complexity of flavors make it seem more thick. Love this beer 878 characterschaz410, Sep 20, 2010

T: Cocoa, molasses, chocolate toffee, alcohol, and many of the scent elements. 
M: Good mouthfeel. Above average density and viscosity.

So much hype, mystique, rarity, aggravation, and emmotional appeal surrounding this beer. Not to mention this years tickets for this beer sold out in 6 minutes (myself included did not get a ticket - yeah I was one of "those" unfortunate few). So thanks to the Ferm for breaking this one out for GABF war planning party.
A: Poured black w/ a ruby colored bubbly head w/ quick dissipation. Ruby color retains around the edges of the beer. 
A: Boozy bourbon, toffee, and caramel. No hop aromatics. No diacetyl or esthers. 
F: Sweet Maple syrup, caramel, toffee, and warming to light chocolate notes. Light bourbon flavor in the finish.
M: Heavy body and mouthfeel, low carbonation, w/ slight alcohol warmth. Not necessarily "burning" Drinks smooth and viscous - syrup like. 
O: Really? That's It? You just reviewed one of the most EPIC beers ever in ~ 63 words? Yes I did and here is why. This beer tasted pretty straightforward to me: It's sweet and rightfully so for an 19% beer. Comparable to Dark Lord, if you removed the fruit and complex notes, I believe you would have black tuesday. Black Tuesday is boozy and sweet. Did the beer hype around this one blow my mind? Yes...The beer itself? Not so much. Tasty yes, drinkable yes, would I give my first born? No. I'm glad I can put to rest the aggravating ambitions of trying to secure one of these bottles for myself. 1,517 charactersadkirkish, Sep 13, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Many many thanks to JohnC for hooking me up with this bottle. Poured into a snifter.
Pours pitch black, oily, with a big mocha head that shows excellent retention and leaves bits of lacing and lots of sticky legs along the sides.
Massively sweet aroma with tons of molasses, chocolate, sugar-coated raisins and plums. Espresso and plenty of bourbon burn in the nose with the accompanying vanilla and oak.
The taste is spectacular starting with the thick, sugary sweet malts, caramel, chocolate and vanilla. There is a lot of dark fruits lurking in the background and the finish burns with bourbon and slight spicy oak.
The mouthfeel is super, super smooth, and uber-sticky from the sweet malts. The bourbon burn is definitely hefty, but I never would have pegged it at this ABV.
This is a stunning beer in that it is overflowing with flavor, clocks in at over 19% ABV and still drinks way, way too easily. Compared to the few other beers I've had in this ABV range, this is the only one I would categorize as world class. Well done Patrick. 1,045 charactersgford217, Aug 29, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5We bought several bottles of this beer about a year ago. They've been sitting in our beer cellar, waiting for the perfect moment to crack one open. Since we live on the East coast, and it's not available here, I paid an obscene amount of money on Ebay. We opened one for my birthday. 
We served this in bourbon stemware.
Appearance: very dark black color. Nice rich dark tan head.
Smell: smells rich and dark and strongly of bourbon. Very fruity. 
Taste: exceptional. The bourbon taste is delicious, it's just the right amount of malt. The fruit is lush.
Mouthfeel: lush and thick. Coats your tongue.
Drinkability: Because of the ridiculous ABV, this is obviously a sipping beer. Because of the cost, I would call this a very special occasion beer. I thought this was everything it was cracked up to be. 809 charactersguess98224, Aug 24, 2010

A--Very black; no reading the newspaper through this one! A little bit of a head with minimal lacing.
S--Chocolate and bourbon.
T--Bourbon, chocolate, and oak. WONDERFUL taste.
M--Thick with just the right amount of carbonation.
D--I say it's great, though most would disagree due to the high alcohol content. I counter that by saying just share it with someone or sip on this one for an hour or more while watching a good movie, game, etc. GREAT beer. 541 charactersSchmittymack, Aug 16, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From tasting notes:
Appearance: Thick and black as motor oil. Small tan head.
Smell: Beautiful vanilla, cocoa, bourbon aroma and oak.
Taste: Sweet, very sweet. Bourbon is very aparent, but it's mouthfeel makes it very approachable, like a shake.
Mouthfeel: Viscous, thick, nicely carbonated. Just enough carbonation to make the flavors open up on the tongue.
Drinkability: Well, 19.5%. Do I need to say much more? It's a great brew to share for a very nice event, but I'd never have a large glass of this. 510 charactersantioch, Aug 10, 2010

Vintage: 2009
Type: 750ml. Bottle
Glassware: Portsmouth Tulip
Sampled at The Epic Sweer & Sour Tasting I w/ wunderbeer(Ron), ShadesofGray(Ryan), and big Dan. Nice event!
Poured a midnight black in color w/ a thin tan that left no lacing. Looks the consistency of 10W-30 motor oil. The nose was of chocolate malt, oak, bourbon, and a unique fig aroma. The taste was of chocolate, bourbon, oak, and dark fruits. The mouthfeel is thick as hell, like a milkshake. Drinkability is about as good as it can possibly be for a 19.50% alcohol beer, but was still slumping me under the table.
Overall, tremendous brew that as much as it sadens me say, lives up to the hype and billing. Great Imperial Stout from Cali! 726 charactersmikeyv35, Aug 02, 2010

Black as night with a kuh-hakie ring o' foam round the edges. Awesome giant legs and curtains of booze sliding down the glass like a downpour on a car windshield. I wish it would rain. It's so hot.
Smells like a bunch o' powdered cocoa in a bourbon frappe. Touch of coconut. Pretty standard fare for this kind of mega-stout. Quite nice. Smell really reminds me of Angel's Share.
Taste is sweet chocolate and raisins, and hot hot hot, but pleasant hot, not like this heatwave weather I'm moored in. So sweet. It almost isn't even a stout... It's like stout liqueur. Damn tasty, though.
Mouthfeel is awesome and fluffy. It's like a chocolate cloud. It possesses an interesting duality in that it is both thick and viscous, but light and fluffy at the same time.
Drinkability is amazing for an RIS, especially one at 19.5% abv. Normally I would penalize a beer so boozy as this one, but this is so quaffable and delicious, I could drink much more than I was allotted... Cheers. 1,091 charactersGarthTaargus, Jul 13, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a Portsmouth tulip. The pour is oil-thick, viscous and dark. There is a thin mocha head that quickly fades to nothing, leaving the most oily lacing behind I have ever seen. 
The nose is an intense blast of bourbon, followed closely by undertones of caramel, vanilla and wood. There is a complimentary dark chocolate, that is rich and strong. The boozy sweetness is intense, almost burning the nostrils. 
The taste follows the smell very closely, the bourbon is first and foremost, hitting the tongue and giving a strong introduction. The sweet vanilla, caramel and wood characteristics compliment the bourbon nicely. The finish is hot and boozy, with a nice strong brown sugar component. The rich dark chocolate takes on a powdery cocoa quality on the tongue. Beyond the bourbon, chocolate and vanilla notes there are hints of dark fruits, layers of figs and hints of cherries; this beer surprises at every sip. The flavor is much more approachable than I expected. 
The beer is thick, viscous and "chewy" with adequate carbonation. The flavors compliment the high alcohol nicely, making this much more approachable than it should be. I couldn't enjoy an entire bottle, but for this high an abv, the beer is very drinkable. I wish there was another glass in my near future. 1,302 charactersrpstevens, Jul 13, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750ml bottle shared at woodshop 5.1
Poured a dark as night black like motor oil with a very thin head and almost no lacing left on the glass. There was a lot going on in the aroma which consisted of chocolate malts, coco nibs, brown sugar, slight bourbon notes, vanilla and toffee. It had a sweet nose which probably included dark fruits as well. You can definitely smell the bourbon. The flavor was really complex with the chocolatey brownie striking first on the palate with bourbon, toffee, vanilla and caramelized sugar accents. After a couple sips I also got slight coco like the nose and booze for sure. Black Tuesday was full bodied with a low amount of carbonation that had a silky sweet and boozy finish. It was pretty drinkable considering the ABV on this beast. I actually enjoyed it more on tap before they released last year don't get me wrong it is still a great beer I just had to put in my two cents on it that's all. This is something everyone should try at least once. 987 charactersGobzilla, Jun 28, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Black waxed 750 mL bottle courtesy of vurt in a very generous trade. Poured in to the Bruery-logoed tulip that was also given as an extra by the very same!
Appearance: Pours an ominous inky black, absolutely pitch, thick, viscous, and oily, like tar in to the tulip. A rather vigorous pour on this one didn't help increase its turbulence too much out of the neck of the bottle - this one was a slick, velvety monster, and it slid right out with no difficulty whatsoever. Whatever vigor it did have managed to elicit a good two fingers of deeply cocoa head that fizzed, surged and ... surprisingly, against all odds ... did manage to stick around for a good three minutes or so, before all hints of surface lace, side lace, and collar had vanished. After an initial surge of embedded carbonation calmed down, this was one still, silent beer.
Aroma: Absolutely decadent ... on first impression, it's a cherry/raspberry chocolate cake, awash in a bourbon fudge glaze. One of the most beautiful and surprising things is the absolute lack of bourbon heat. I'm just amazed at how they were able to bury so much alcohol. That's not to say there's no bourbon or barrel presence or character - there's plenty of vanilla, some coconut, and some toasted wood sugars, but still ... damn. The alcohol heat does begin to make itself known as this one hits room temperature, but it took long enough that I'm still colored impressed. Raspberry and cherry syrup coat the nostrils fully, that beautiful mistake of high-alcohol fermentation, melding wonderfully with the slightly toasty but mostly sweet, fudgy, bittersweet chocolate malts. 
Taste: Ridiculously sweet and incredibly flavorful. The malts in this one are over the top intense and over the top sweet - I found myself wiping my mouth after almost every sip, like you would do with a milkshake. Huge fudgy chocolate dominates the flavor profile, slightly bittersweet, a little milky, or at least suggestive of mikyness. The cocoa comes across as powdery at points but mostly Hershey's-syrup esque, and you can find it in recognizable form in corners of your mouth that you haven't touched with your tongue in minutes a full half an hour after taking a sip. Various other sweet malts try and jump in - toffee, maybe, some caramel and lactic sweetness, maple syrup, a few hints of dryer malts, toast, faint espresso. 
One of the wonderful things about high abv% beers is definitely showcased in this one, and that's the high, sharp, fruity esters that yeast produce under such conditions. This one takes on beautiful sherry-esque notes, with raspberry, cherry, and blueberry notes mingling with all the stray sugars to suggest pure extracts or fruit syrups.
The barrel aging here contributes a few coconut overtones, some slight wood sugars, and plenty of vanilla, but as far as bourbon goes, I think it gets lost at places. There's alcohol heat here - particularly compared to the nose, where alcohol heat was practically non-existent - but the spicy, slightly earthy, mildly roasted malt notes that are associated with bourbon are a little muddled.
Mouthfeel: Thick, syrupy, and absolutely over the top ... but with a surprising amount of carbonation. I also imagine it's been thinned out a little by the spirit infusion ... I tremble at the thought of this beer's original gravity. The thickness does keep this beer remarkably even, creamy ... no, it's too thick to be described as creamy. This one's sort of like melted ice cream (cheap ice cream, such that its 50% air to begin with), at that point when it's been sitting around just long enough that it's reached liquefaction, but not long enough that all of the infused air has yet escaped.
Drinkability: So much to say about this beer and so few characters in which to say it. First, there's no way in hell I'm going to give a beer: 1) this overwhelmingly sweet; and (more importantly) 2) this overwhelmingly high in alcohol anything above a 4.0, and as a self-respecting beeradvocate, I just can't do it. This is nonetheless a really enjoyable beer, and every sip I took made me wish more and more I had a piece of fudge or a slice of German chocolate cake to pair it with. This is the quintessential dessert beer, the sweetest beer I've ever had, and an absolutely over the top decadent treat that I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to have. Is it - to quote a memorable BA thread - only a matter of time before it becomes the #1 beer on BA? Clearly (as its fall from the top 5 indicates) not. It is, however, a great beer, one showing both a mastery of production as well as of craft, and one I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try. Worth seeking out ... though, honestly, not worth trading what a lot of people have probably traded it over. 4,759 charactersCrellMoset, Jun 24, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had this during the NBA Final game. A full tulip for both me and my buddy cmorton. I also poured some samples for my non beer nerd friends, the bartender, and the owner of Blue Palm's (where we were watching the game). I brought the bottle from home, so don't go rushing over to Blue Palms expecting to find a bottle (they do however have Firestone X if you have $165 you wish to spend). Pardon the detailed introduction, but this was probably my biggest want ever.
A: Pours jet black. Like super duper black. A fat couple of finger reddish khaki/mocha head. Very surprised by the amount of head as many high abv/barrel aged beers usually do not have much. Oily, syrupy legs when swirled, and wisps of lacing left behind. Looks heavy.
S: An almost candy like aroma of brown sugar, caramel, english toffee, maple syrup, vanilla, and chocolate cake batter spiked with bourbon. Hints of raspberry and cherry are also there. Smells quite sweet and insanely decadent.
T: Very sweet. There is caramelized brown sugar, english toffee, black strap molasses, maple syrup, and sweet chocolate fudge. This is a very sweet beer, but somehow manages not to be cloying or soy sauce like. Then there is vanilla, some hint of oak and a solid bourbon kick. Not quite as heavy on the bourbon as I imagined but it is waiting at the end of each sip to let you know what's up. I was eating lobster mac and cheese while sipping on this, and the sweetness of BT with the creaminess of the lobster mac was epic. The sweetness is a little much on it's own otherwise this would have been a 5 as well.
M: Surprisingly not the thickest beer ever. Don't get me wrong, it is quite thick and syrupy, but there are others out there that can contend. Full bodied, incredibly rich, low carbonation, and an almost velvety texture. It's a little hot too, but that's mostly on the back end as it is going down (not as hot as I imagined though).
D: It's 19.5%, but manages to mask that in a complex shroud of sweet delicious desert flavors spiked with bourbon. I would have guessed it's abv to be much lower if I wasn't already aware. It is definitely something you will want to sip on and savor, but I could see myself drinking a whole bottle (which would be an epicly poor decision). 2,252 charactersbillshmeinke, Jun 22, 2010

A: Pours a 1/4 finger mocha head that quickly collapses in on itself. Beer is a black hole. Perhaps the blackest I've ever seen any RIS. No lacing. 
S: Ridiculous booziness upfront drowns out all pretenses of complexity. My nostrils fight to try to get something more here. Some chocolate, prunes, raisins, other dried, dark fruit, brownie, and licquorice. Not the most appetizing aroma as I think I'm gonna get a facefull of alcohol... 
T: Chocolate, dark fruit, brownies, and licquorice. Exceedingly sweet and a huge booze bomb. Make no mistake about it, I tasted all 19.5% of this one and every sip made me cringe. Aftertaste is... what else? Sweet is all heck and still incredibly hot and boozy. The complexity is definitely there... but its blanketed by alcohol. 
M: Medium to full bodied with more carbonation than I'd expect. Oily in the mouth and silky going down. Very smooth for its ABV. Finish is messy with a big, lingering aftertaste. 
D: All hype. How could I think anything else? Waaay to boozy and waaaay too sweet. Its sad since there's a lot going on here and the feel is near perfect but why does it have to be 19.5% and why does it have to flaunt every single % in the taste and nose?!?! I'll give it another try down the line but as it is now, definitely not my cup of tea and DEFINITELY not worth the buzz and trouble. 1,541 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 30, 2010
3.61/5  rDev -19.2%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Thanks Kevin for sharing this!
A- Body is a deep, dark, viscous black color. Fizzy head appears and fades quickly into a thin, light tan collar.
S- Nose is very boozy at first-which is to be expected for a 40 proof beer. Alcohol astringency all over the place, beneath this is a very sweet background of bourbon, peanut butter, milk chocolate, amaretto, vanilla, toffee, and caramel.
T- Flavor is very sweet at first. Milk chocolate, notes of sweet bourbon, caramel, and sugary sweetness. The finish is much like the initial flavor and is surprisingly smooth with minimal alcohol astringency- but it packs a lot of heat at the end with a big alcohol warmth.
M- Low carbonation. Thick, syrupy, and smooth and creamy. Minimal alcohol consistency.
D- I am very pleasantly surprised by this one because its a 19.5% beer that drinks like an 11%. This was split amongst 5 people so I had a good 5 oz-but not a whole serving. A good beer overall-but inconceivable for it not to be shared-so I am hesitant to give the drinkability a 4. Surprisingly not boozy with the exception of the nose and VERY sweet. This brew is quite complex-but not really balanced. 1,154 charactersPittBeerGirl, May 24, 2010

A-pours a jet black liquid with a dark tan colored dense head.
S-the nose is not as boozy as I feared. lots of roasted malts up front, peanut butter, dark chocolate and vanilla. bourbon takes hold behind, hints of acetone.
T-again does pretty well on the flavor in compared to the alcohol content. tons of roasted malts up front, dark chocolate and lots of vanilla. notes of bourbon in the middle with some nice sweetness in the back. the acetone is quite light and it is hot but not much especially for the alcohol.
M-as expected, huge, thick, chewy. great carbonation level to hold body but still fall down the throat.
D-this is huge as expected but no where near the boozy mess I thought it was going to be. the alcohol is there, much more so in the nose. the balance of roasted malts and sweetness is done well and the bourbon notes are present; but a complete lack of any oak and a little hot in the back. 956 characterscpetrone84, May 22, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5pours out a thick, deep brown liquid that would accommodate no light to shine through and only some mere ruby highlights on it's edges. It was an exciting moment I had anticipated for months.
The minimal carbonation that culminated right after a vigorous pour, dissipated to leave a halo of moderately sized bubbles where the cherished booze touched the glassed edges.
Black Tuesday's gives off a deep aroma of dark cherries, chocolate, with roasty, as well as prune, raisin and fig notes. Lots of alcohol in the nose with licorice and very rich bourbon to sweeten things out on the end. So far the aromas do not disappoint.
The taste is as complex as it is alluring. The velvety smooth liquid tastes of caramel, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit, prune and dark cherry that all appear miraculously with a syrupy, sticky alcoholic heat on the finish. In the most simplistic manner, Black Tuesday is one big dark chocolate covered cherry that has been soaking in bourbon.
The complex flavors are a lot for one's palate to contemplate. Its oily yet silky smoothness makes this beer incredible in mouthfeel alone. This revelation simplifies the complexities of flavor, yet the syrupy sweetness leaves the palate with full-bodied remnants that could almost be chewed.
Hype can be undoubtedly bad for a beer, just as it could be good. My opinion of this beer suffered greatly through my first sips, expecting a life-changing event after reading how great it was. Upon more thorough contemplation, and drinking much more Imperial stouts, I realized the intensity of flavor this beer offers. This is a must drink in my opinion. 1,622 charactersLldeegan, May 22, 2010

Thanks goes to infestaxion for this one. He told me the night before DLD '10 that he'd share this with me the next day, then sought me out to make sure that I got a pour of it. I wound up getting three more pours of it throughout the day from other good souls, but Dave gets the credit, since he was first. Thanks goes also to the others who shared with me though, of course!
This appears to be black at first glance, but with a little backlighting it reveals itself to be a very dark brown color with red highlights. A small head of dark tan colored foam forms on top and then quickly dissipates, leaving a small surface ring around the edges. Lacing is minimal, but a few spotty pieces are here. The 'legs' on this thing are most impressive, though. A light swirl leaves an ample oily residue clinging to the side of the glass and slowly sliding back down to the surface of the liquid.
The smell is amazing! Lots of things are happening inside this glass. Big notes of oak and vanilla. Lots of chocolates are here, both of the milk and dark varieties. Good presence of dark fruits, especially dates and raisins. Nice hints of caramel, brown sugar, and toffee, with a big shot of molasses thrown in. Light hint of smoke. Nice espresso bean notes. Very good bourbon presence. Good shot of lightly roasted maltiness.
Maybe the most complex and intriguing nose that I've experienced to date. The booze is a touch to forward to give it a 'perfect', but it's nowhere near as prominent as I expected with a 19.50%abv. Still, I could just sit here and smell it for a long time, without drinking it, and I'd be happy.
The taste is so good! Almost everything that was spotted in the nose makes another appearance in the flavor profile. You also get a little tiny hint of licorice and some faint coconut notes. A touch of figs comes through with the other dark fruits. A little bit of yeasty biscuit quality is here. Some very mild spice notes are way down deep. 
The overall taste is that of a sweet stout. If you like your stouts more on the roasty side this is probably not for you. While it is very complex, it is also suprisingly smooth and nicely balanced.
Worth the wait, as far as I'm concerned.
This one is quite thick and somewhat oily. It has a mild level of carbonation, which works very well for it. It's so silky smooth and easy to swallow. I'd give it a 'perfect' if it had some creaminess going on.
Okay, at 19.50%abv this is too easy to drink. Nothing this 'high-octane' should go down this easily. I'm sure that I'd regret drinking an entire bottle by myself, the next day or something, but I'd have a great time doing it, and don't think that it would be a problem to do so. It's so smooth and easy and delicious. 2,804 characterscoldmeat23, May 11, 2010

A: Pours Dark Black. Medium tan head, but NO lacing. Looks like it came out a little thin. 
S: One word: Molasses! dark fruits come through and I pick up alcohol, but not the 19.5%. Nice bourbon and vanilla aromas. Smells a lot like the 08 Darkness I had a little while back. 
T: Very sweet. Lots of alcohol/bourbon in the front. Dark Fruit appears in the finish with molasses and vanilla. I like the sweetness, but if you dont, this beer is not for you. Also, the alcohol burn is there. 
M: Surprisingly thin. I was hoping for more body with this and some nice chewy thickness.
D: Its sweet and high alcohol, so you cant drink a lot of this, but overall, I thought my 3rd of the bottle serving was perfect. 778 charactersboothbeer, May 11, 2010

S- Very wonderful smell and a lot going on here. Woody, sweet malts, bit of vanilla, caramel and molasses. Some chocolate and alcohol here too. 
T- A nice mix of flavors sweet malts, vanilla, chocolate, figs, black licorice and caramel. The alcohol is here but not nearly as strong as I expected.
M- Very full in body and low carbonation. Almost like syrupy too.

 I did get a chance to sample this one at Dark Lord Day, but I never got to review it. 
I poured this into my Duvel tulip--
It isn't as dark or viscous as I was expecting it to be. It is a very deep brown in color, not black at all, but it has very large bubbles of a tan head that disapaited ather quickly and settled into a little whispy cloud of a thin cap of bubbles... But the bubbles are enormous in size. I did give this a rather vigarous pour to get some kind of head, and I've been swirling it every now and then to see the legs and release some volatiles. 
I first smell a really big boozy/whiskey presence. It just has to be the alcohol level-- which is noticable in the beer, but it isn't kicking your ass, it's actually very nice the way the alcohol bite melds in with the choclate and vanilla notes that I'm getting out of this one. A whole bunch of intense dark flavors with a lot of english toffee and even some coffee. Very nice nose, and very delicious. Swirling it around my mouth really opens up that alcohol warming sensation that is working quite well with this brew. On the taste you do get some coffee and some chocolate with a little vanilla and toffee in there as well.
Very nice taste, and surprisingly well-balanced for being as strong as it is. The 8 ozs I had is more than sufficient in terms of how much I would want to drink of this beer. I would honestly have no interest in trying to take down a whole bottle of this beer, but I mean that not as put-down of the beer, but rather a sad comment on the realization that I am in fact a wuss. (At least on this particular day-- where this was opened up 9/10s of the way through a pretty big and bold tasting party).
 I do feel lucky to be given another chance to try this beer again, so big props to Dan for inviting me over!
On the mouthfeel, you really get that this a full thick stout, and that it actually is thicker than it looks. It looks thinner than it feels. 
As this warms, I am getting even more of that roasted malty goodness.
Overall-- I'm going to say that this is a great beer-- but as far as all the hype-- I think that the ABV is the real reason this has become a bit of a whale. They do a great job creating a flavor profile around the huge ABV, as opposed to trying to cover it up. It is worth trying, and I'd like to see all of the hoarders give up a few bottles here and there to guys willing to let others in on a tasting. 2,632 charactersAleWatcher, May 09, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Dark black with a touch of red and a nice tan head. Head faded relatively quickly and didn't leave anything on the sides.
S - Molasses and fruity are the two things I pickup out side of the normal big stouts. Nice roasted malts and muted chocolate with some interesting coffee malts that just meld with the other smells.
T - I got the impression that this beer was way over-hyped but the taste is actually quite stunning. Incredibly smooth with a nice cocoa and roasted backbone. A pretty sweet beer, and I had no idea this was nearly 20% while drinking it until someone mentioned it. Don't taste the alcohol.
M - Oily and slick, mediumly carbonated.
D - Way way waaay to drinkable for 19.5%. Are you kidding me? Dangerous stuff. 737 charactersAgentZero, May 01, 2010

Vintage 2011. Side by side with batch 2 of Chocolate Rain!
Poured into snifter from bomber bottle. Pours a black not quite opaque color with a small brownish tan head. 
Smells of boozy bourbon, vanilla, and rich chocolate.
Taste is wonderful! Bourbon goodness right away with chocolate, marshmellows, and vanilla. Very sweet and rich. Finishes sweet with vanilla, oak, hint of leather & tobacco with even more bourbon.
Awesome mouthfeel heavy full bodied beer with low carbonation. Viscous, and coats the mouth first sip! Drinkable when you consider how high the ABV is. It still has that warming heat to it. 
Overall: Its a beast of a beer. Drank side by side with Chocolate Rain, my preference goes to Chocolate rain over Black Tuesday, but you gotta have a great base beer to make Chocolate Rain. 827 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Apr 25, 2010

Poured a nice jet black with small tan head. A swirl of the glass left a thick residue on the side. Awesome.
Smelled of bourbon and dark fruit. I am almost able to get drunk off inhaling this stuff , its so hot..
One sip and you realize this isnt an ordinary beer. There is plenty of stout style flavors in this ; Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, a bit of a grainy flavor as well, like a chewy nutty taste. However the alc% just bites right through all of it at times when i wish it hadn't. The flavors are just too big all around at this time, an d i wonder how this will age.
Mouthfeel is just about right, as is isnt too thick like bourbon county.
One 4 oz taster and i was feelin pretty buzzed, i couldnt drink a whole bottle alone, or even 2 people probably. It's like drinking liquor with alot more flavor than usual.
Overall I am glad i didnt spend 30$ on a bottle because this to me isn't as good as say The Abyss, and thats 12$. 978 charactersBastardKing24, Apr 22, 2010
3.61/5  rDev -19.2%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3A big thanks to GregMcQ for sharing a bottle with me and many other BA friends.
A: Pours an opaque black color. A very minimal and bubbly tan head forms. The foam recedes in an second, and leaves no lace. Just an extremely dense liquid.
S: An awesome aroma of toasted, chocolate malt. Brown sugar. Dry wood, oak, and vanilla. Very sweet aromas. Some raisin and dark fruits. Lots of alcohol from the start.
T: Not nearly as complex as the nose. Still, it is very enjoyable. Alcohol hits right up front. Though raisin and other dark fruits come in to play. Powdered chocolate and vanilla. Alcohol is very powerful.
M/D: A full and sticky body. Very low carbonation. Almost under carbonated. A syrupy adhesive sticks to the tongue. Tons of alcohol. Something that needs to be sipped.
I did really enjoy this beer. Though it is hard to rate, and hard to categorize. Similar to Utopias in how extreme the beer is. Overall this is very good, and something that is great to share with friends. Very much worth a try, but it is still not among my favorites of the style. 1,064 characterschamp103, Apr 19, 2010

Pours a surprising clear dark blackish red, some ruby highlights in the edges, medium sized brown head forms, slowly settles to a thin ring, some lace spots stick, very oily looking.
Smell is great, very intense stuff, toffee and chocolate, big bourbon notes, vanilla, oak, brown sugar, raisin, light roast, a touch of smoke, sweet and sugary through the middle, some booze, oats, coconut, pretty crazy.
Taste is awesome too, very rich, sweet at first, toffee and bourbon, vanilla, nice and woody, lightly roast and some chocolate, biscuit, raisin, brown sugar, oats, decent amount of fruity sweetness, port, sweet and lightly spicy in the finish, real nice coconut cream aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is oily and thick, big body, low carbonation, some heat going down but drinks no where near 20%. Some hype? Of course, but in this case it deserves it, this is great stuff. Thanks Eric!! 969 charactersViggo, Apr 12, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks Eric! 
This pours like motor oil. Really rich dark black, with ruby high-lights on the sides in the light. A large mocha tan head that quickly fades and dies off.
The nose was full of molasses, some chocolate and spice, toasty and smokey, raisins, espresso and cocoa, some real light red fruit coming from the alcohol. This is just a great aroma. Hard to take my nose out of the glass.
The taste follows but with more complex flavours. Super rich, chocolatey, molasses stewed plums, dates and raisins, some vanilla hints in the dark espresso roastyness. There is a cool toasted coconut like taste that swims around in this one. Some smokey notes are also present. This is a little sweet, but still fairly dry for the alcohol content and complexity.
The body is oily, sweet, thick, slimy and moderate carbonation. Not too hot. 
An amazing sipping beer. Really really rich and inviting with flavours coming out as it warms. I think this is a winner. It does live up to all the hype. a "Wow" beer. 1,006 charactersbartle, Apr 12, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle, big thanks from my man in Cali, Hophead84, who went beyond the call of duty to help me out with some pre-sales of this stuff back when it came out - finally getting to crack a bottle with a few BAs. Cheers mate!
Pours a deep deep black, a thin ring or ruby molasses color around the edges when held to the light, a surprising mocha head builds on the pour but doesn't have much staying power.
My nose picks up toasted brown sugar with almost a hint of cinnamon crunch, rich chocolate, a touch of molasses. Quite sweet, so full.
This is pretty much the ultimate dessert beer and that was how I approached it, fantastic in small amounts but not something you'd drink a whole bottle of. Mega sweet but somehow never getting of hand. Fudgy chocolate, a hint of baker's chocolate, vanilla, something vinous in there, a touch of bourbon, a touch of roast but wouldn't have minded a bit more to counter the sweetness, light booze and warming in the swallow but imagined a whole lot more, somehow they hide it extremely well. Lots of complexity for such a big beer, each sip picking up a few new things - wasn't expecting that.
Thick, rich mouthfeel that coats your whole mouth, rich without being overly syrupy. Again, perhaps a little more dryness in the finish could have aided the balance but it's so luxurious and rich that this is only nitpicking.
A ton of effort and $ went into getting this beer and I thought it might be a touch of a letdown. It wasn't. It's a great beer, perhaps not my all time favorite but certainly in that top echelon. 1,560 charactersritzkiss, Apr 11, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Eric for opening this one. You went through a lot of crap to get these, but this is a damn fine beer.
Pours just shy of black, with dark brown highlights when held up to the light. A mocha head soon fades to a collar before disappearing altogether. The aroma is neat - chocolate, vanilla, coffee, bourbon, wood. Lots going on, but not quite as intense as expected.
Flavour is complex and liqueur-like in its intensity. Lots of chocolate at first, a fruity sweetness in the middle, and a spicy finish. At times there are notes of coconut, pepper, brown sugar and vanilla. Nice and an ideal dessert beer. My one slight criticism is that I'd like a bit more roastiness, but that's pretty minor. Decadent, full mouthfeel suits this beer to a tee. Drinkability is impressive, and the alcohol really is not anywhere near discernible. The sweetness and richness certainly limit the size of the pour, and I think it worked great over 150ml. I'd probably go close to double that, but no more.
Well worth trying. Kinda hyped, but actually worth it. Definitely a sharer, but a unique experience as far as beer is concerned. Thanks again, Eric! 1,149 charactersbobsy, Apr 11, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours opaque, dark with a full finger loose foamy tan head that fades fairly quickly with little lacing. The smell is aggressive, intense and complex. It starts off with a full on cherry vanilla assault over caramel and chocolate character. As it warms up the bourbon aroma becomes more intense, eventually maturing into an intense black licorice. Full flavored, the taste matches up to the nose really well, step for step. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and creamy; a small sip coats the entire mouth thoroughly. The after taste lingers on and on with and the bourbon licorice and dark fruit notes. The 19.5% ABV is ever present but not distracting. Shared this one with my sons the day of the last snow, after-Easter christening the beginning of the 2010 BBQ season. This one is phenomenally complex. Very similar to my favorite Double Stouts but with a tad extra edge. 890 charactersjjayjaye, Apr 11, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours a deep brown color with garnet highlights, with almost no head or carbonation. Heavy aroma of Raisinets (and I love Raisinets), along with notes of port wine and a good dose of booze.
 Palate is big, rich, and luxurious. Up front, huge notes of dark fruit (fig and prune), maple, and honey. Chocolate, port wine, and a bit of roasted malt follow, with a long, sweet, maple finish. 
 Body is thick and rich, and just a touch sticky. Holds the flavors really well, the perfect vessel for the ridiculous complexity of this beer. Just phenomenal. 548 charactersElGordo, Apr 02, 2010
4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750 mL 2009 vintage thanks to callmemickey. 
Pours thick jet black, completely opaque. Pretty thin mocha head as expected, and beautiful lacing and some "legs." Aroma or bourbon with a little pine and oak. Thick oily mouthfeel. Nice sweetness on the tongue, then a great bitter espresso followed by a huge caramel finish. Lingering taste of chocolate and cocoa powder.
As it warms, you get more booze in the nose and on the tongue as well as some chocolate and cherry in the aroma.
Overall, an exceptionally well made brew and easily one of my favorites of all time. 569 charactersChrisPro, Mar 29, 2010
4.29/5  rDev -4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had on tap at The Bruery.
It's an Imperial Stout and 19.5%! It poured pitch black, hence the name, and smelled of: vanilla, dark chocolate, malt and bourbon. It tasted like molasses, brown sugar, chocolate malt, prunes, raisins, espresso, slight anise and an oaky bourbon finish, which actually wasn't that strong of an alcohol burn considering it's 19.5%! All in all, it was delicious. 386 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010
3.64/5  rDev -18.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Huge thanks to pecorasc for sharing this one with boothbeer and I. Drank this after having CCB Hunahpu's IS. Poured into a tulip glass.
A- Produced a fingers width of flimsy, cream/mocha colored head. The beer looked a little on the thin side as it was being poured into the glass. Reduced to a thin ring throughout consumption.
S- Big molasses aroma upfront. Alcohol notes produce a nutty-like attribute. Has a sweet, sugary chocolate finish. Other than an ever so slight nose burn, the alcohol was pretty well hidden. Very rich and boozy, but without the alcohol heat. 
T- Sweet, very sweet, then intensely sweet. Chocolate, bourbon and molasses rolled into one. Vanilla notes come in midway through along with a boozy finish. Once again, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. The problem was that all of the subtleties were masked by an overbearing sweetness that just seemed to grow and grow as the beer was consumed. 
M- Tad disappointing. Heavy bodied, but still retained a much thinner feel than expected. Little carbonation. 
D- If I was basing this on ABV, this would have received a 5.0. Drinks more like a 9-10% RIS. However, the sweetness was an absolute overkill and that's an understatement. Became nearly unbearable towards the end. 
Overall, just flat out too sweet. Couldn't help but think I would contract diabetes after drinking this. There is a depth and complexity there, but for the most part it's masked. Glad I finally got to try it, but won't be seeking it out in the future. 1,503 charactersrhinos00, Mar 24, 2010

Poured into my Delirium Tremens snifter glass
A - Thick, pitch black, syrupy with a small layer of mocha bubbles. Lacing doesn't stick to the glass. Just by looking at it, you know it's going to be big and heavy.
S - Chocolate and bourbon dominate. And the chocolate is extensive...there's some cocoa powder, milk, and lots of dark chocolate. It's very rich, like liquid fudge and bourbon mixed. There is just a little bit of an alcohol smell on the back end. I think I served it too cold, as I've had a lot of other smells other times when it was a bit warmer.
T - Wow!! Bourbon notes mixed with dark chocolates, like truffles. There is just a bit of booze after it warms up, and maple comes out as well. Deliciousness! Still makes my knees weak every time I taste it.
M - heavy body mixed with carbonation. I don't think you can expect much more from a beer like this.
D - How is 18.5% mixed into a beer this good and drinkable? It's truly amazing, and I wish I could drink this all the time.
This is the third time I've had it, and it still is just as awesome as if I had waited 4 hours in line to get my bottle allotment. 1,306 charactersKaiser81, Mar 24, 2010

The only flaw of BT is the smell of strong booze. The flavors are thick molasses, burnt malts, dark chocolate, and smooth bourbon. Mouthfeel is bar none the thickest beer I've drunk. WWS, BCS, and Rasputin XII aren't even close. Light carbonation. Even my alcohol aversion is forgotten making me want to come back for more. 
The two aspects that really make this beer shine are perfect mouthfeel and powerful flavor, which some will claim is cloying. Non beer drinkers who sampled this also really enjoyed it. 640 charactersjobcrackerbah, Mar 15, 2010

The taste has developed much more and it's drinking wonderful now. Not as cloyingly sweet, which had turned me off. I didn't really find any flavor from the oak though. The nose has a huge soy sauce aroma too. I'm giving a lower rating to the smell and bigger rating to the taste.
*Original Review*
Pitch black liquid with a dark tan head. Smells like chocolate, sweet malt, bourbon creeping in, vanilla, oak.
Taste is very sweet. Intense malt. Bourbon isn't as prominent in the flavor profile as expected. Oak is there but backlashed by the overall sweetness. Alcohol is amazingly well hidden behind this barrier of sugary liquid. Not much of a surprise. 684 charactersBearsOnAcid, Mar 13, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pitch black color with a small dark tan head which fades quickly. Smells of bourbon, raisins, figs, oak, vanilla, chocolate syrup and molasses. A lot going on with this one. Very complex. 
The taste surprises me. I thought there would be a lot of alcohol heat in this beer, but there is not. I can taste the raisins, chocolate syrup , figs, molasses, and vanilla, but the oak and the alcohol are lighter than I thought they would be. Quite good. This beer has more chocolate flavor than any I have had before.
 This beer is viscous, full bodied, but also smooth, with low carbonation. This is quite an experience. Quite drinkable, but at 19.5%, I would not want to drink a lot of this in one sitting. 702 charactershardy008, Mar 13, 2010

the great black tuesday! as it hits the glass it covers everything like napalm, scorching its way up the angled chalice. the glass even feels heavier than it should with this weight in it. it is darker than the 6 eyes of cerberus. it reaks of dark roast, chocolate candy, molasses, dark fruits, and anger. i have never smelled such a terrifying creature. it takes time, but, trembling, i bring the glass to my lips and drink. it is one of those few beers that you don't even want to swallow for at least a minute. it must coat everything, which it quickly and angrily obliges. the malts are outstanding, sweet and dominating. it is not of this world. for 19.5%, there is so little alcohol flavor. what a brilliant job brewing this beer by the guys at the bruery, the only brewery we were unable to hit that we really wanted to on the 3 week grand tour.
the only way to finish this beer, with just a half ounce left, and a black sheen all over it, is by a few ounces of swirling with pliny the elder. this is the life we were born to lead. 1,308 charactersolympuszymurgus, Mar 06, 2010

4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5a lot of this will probably overlap with beavers below. we enjoyed this one yesterday. a lot.
deep deep black all the way to the edges with a quarter inch head that is darker than tan, nearing brown. incredible (did not end up being the darkest though). the head regenerates wonderfully with just a swirl. and! this is the first time i can say ive appreciated the legs of a beer. that was a fun discovery. not as excessive/impressive as other high alcohol beverages, but there, and pretty, and from a beer.
smell is full of sweetness. milky caramel, bourbon and chocolate. there is a hint of soy sauce for me. i believe beavers said salty in that respect. the heat is more perceptible in the smell than the taste.
sweet everything. man. chocolate, bourbon, cake, cherry tootsie pop when the cherry is mostly gone and its all tootsie roll, molasses minus the tanginess. but then all this sweetness is balanced with a nearly hidden roastiness, moderate (incredible for 19.5%) alcohol, and a bit of a vinous characteristic. at the end of the glass, the last few drops (not even last sip, but last drops) are huge on the molasses (tanginess evident), and booze. that the alcohol waited that long to wake up is phenomenal.
Edit 1: forgot to mention that we found these flavors to lie on a gradient. every flavor blended into the next, there wasnt huge bourbon here, huge chocolate there. it was all just a subtle gradation from one flavor to the next. super duper.
creamy and poofy with carbonation playing its part to keep it fluffy. ive used creamy to describe beers before, but this one makes me think of heavy cream with just the right amount of carbonation to remove most of it from my tongue. wow.
drinkability is insane. it is so easy to forget this is a near-20% abv beer. 20% alcohol, 100% delicious. it is incredibly balanced, generously full of flavor, and delightful in every aspect.
Edit 2: again, forgot to mention that after we had finished our glasses, we were ready to drink anything. this beer wasnt overwhelming in any negative way. we moved on to other beers with no problem, and wouldnt have hesitated to drink more of this one if there was another open bottle in front of us. mmm!! 2,205 charactersCrittervision, Feb 24, 2010

Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Deschutes tulip glass. Obviously, this is the 20 malts version.
A: This is the best feature of this beer. Lively, flowy, gracious head! For such a high ABV, this is impressive (compared to the likes of BCS, BA BORIS, etc.). Bubbles tantalize your eyes as they sit atop the beer.
S: Bourbon, vanilla, oak, maple, wood, and black cherries. Honestly, I also got hints of a mulled wine aroma too.
T: Sweet, sweet, sweet molasses. Just kidding. This is the sweetest/sugariest beer I have ever had though (thank you 20 malts!). Bourbon in the background and leaves a pleasant vanilla taste as it goes down.
M: This is the best feature of this beer. Like an emulsion and warming against the inside of the mouth when swished around. Haagen Daaz milkshake anyone?
D: This is the best feature of this beer. For 19.5% ABV, this stuff goes down real easy. We split this bottle 4 ways and had no problem finishing our glasses within an hour or two (of course because you want to savor it!).
Did you notice I wrote "This is the best feature of this beer" too many times? Yeah, that's because this beer is awesome! Very appreciative for getting to try this. 1,246 charactershoppymcgee, Feb 24, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to jrallen24 for this beautiful bottle. 
750ml split three ways. Snifter style.
Pours jet black with an oily and creamy dark brown head [note: I said that this was perhaps the darkest head I've seen...but was beaten later in the night by Marshall Zhukovs]. Looks like old motor oil. Head dies down to a blanket covering, but restores easily with a swirl. 
Rich and decadent aroma of caramel, sweet dark chocolate, and ___ . Bourbon notes are present but are definitely secondary behind the sweet candied flavors. Fusel alcohol notes are also unsurprising existent and while they significantly increase as it warms, they are definitely in the back. 
Taste is very sweet upfront (chocolate syrup, molasses, and caramelized sugars) and this sugary sweetness transitions seamlessly into sweet bourbon flavor and builds from there. The bouron barrel gives off nice earthy flavors of toasted wood, vanilla bean, and licorice. This really isn't an overly roasty RIS, and I don't really get coffee...and it doesn't bother me one bit. The alcohol is AMAZINGLY well hidden and the barrel perfectly integrated. 
The mouthfeel is syrupy and viscous, and while I thought it would be too much, it is not where near cloying for me. This beer is huge in every way possible but is extremely drinkable considering the 19.5%. We all thought that it tasted much more like a 10% beer. 1,379 charactersbeavers, Feb 23, 2010
4.01/5  rDev -10.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5We split a bottle at Cambridge Commons at the post EBF lunch. Usual suspects avryle and drseamus. Before the review let it be said we had 6 people to split the bottle and we probably could have used another person or two.
A: It is black. That really does not do it justice though. This is the blackest beer that I have ever seen. The pour was in slow motion at it was really sticking to the snifters. More head than I thought would be on this beer. Super deep mocha/ coffee colored. No lacing.
S: Nothing like bourbon at noon on a Sunday. The bourbon really is overpowering. You get booze behind that. A little bit of burnt espresso beans and just a touch of chocolate after it had been sitting in my glass for about 30 min.
T: Bourbon again. This is one of the most over the top bourbon tastes in a beer ever. The heat and the sweetness catch up as well. There is not enough roast bitterness to balance it out. It is a one dimensional beer but it was an enjoyable experience.
M: Super thick. Just coated everything on the way down. The heat is part of the mouthfeel big time. You can actually feel this beer hit your stomach.
D: I am torn. It is a singular effort but it is not that drinkable a beer. We split the 750 6 ways and people had a hard time finishing their glasses. Granted we were in a restaurant but this beer probably needs quite a few friends and many hours with no one driving afterwards. I would drink it again though. 1,441 charactersaerozeppl, Feb 23, 2010

It's warm and dark with excellent bourbon barrel character. The black and roasted malts are present and accounted for. The taste is perfect in my opinion. It's a strong black, earthy, roasted beer with a thick rich flavor that goes down warm and finishes the same with a nice bourbon character. The bourbon really compliments the overall experience. The mouthfeel is exceptional. It is a full bodied beer with near perfect carbonation. This is my new favorite beer in the world. It has everything I'm looking for in a drinking experience. 650 charactersWesWes, Feb 22, 2010

Beer is black (shocking) and forms a thin brown head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Carbonation is moderate to low. When I swirl the beer it coats the glass and leaves legs on the walls of the glass like a fine wine would do.
This is a seriously big beer, I was expecting alcohol in the nose but no...it smells sweet and there's some bourbon smell in there but no straight alcohol. I can pick up some roast as well. Really nicely balanced, seriously.
Beer is sweet up front but has a good body to it, medium. I'm definitely not drinking rubbing alcohol but I'm also not chewing it. There is some bitterness in the back but again, the alcohol is completely masked. I'm knocking it down on drinkability because I honestly don't think I could drink a lot of it, its builds on me in both sweetness and bitterness but its a great beer. Think Bourbon County on steriods. 1,056 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 22, 2010

A-black. oil. not too much of a head, but more than i expected for a 19.5% abv beer
S-bourbon overpowering, as per usual with the style. lots of chocolatey notes as well, although much harder to notice than i wouldve liked because of all of the bourbon 
T-WAY too much sugar IMO, honestly kinda burned my throat on the way down--but not because of it being too hot, because it was just so sweet/rich. also huge amounts of chocolate again, really nice chocolate flavor, not AS bourbon-forward as the smell would have made me think
M-thick, thick, thick. like a freakin smoothie-but in a good way.
D-for being 19.5%, i guess one could say its very drinkable, but at the same time i had trouble getting down my glass because of the sugary burning aspect of it-just way too rich and sugary for me.
Overall it's a good beer, pretty impressive, but nowhere near the "god" of all beers like people say. Wouldn't go out of my way to have it again, happy i got a chance to try it though. 1,051 charactersFahmie25, Feb 21, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is a true monster of a beer. The full brunt of the 19.5% ABV and strong bourbon character pack a hell of a one-two punch.
It pours from the bottle like oil from the drain plug on my car when I've gone 15k miles without a change...dark and thick. It looks truly syrupy in the glass and they'll probably need a chisel to clean the glass fully. 
The bourbon aroma is intense as it wafts out of the glass and up your nose to rip the hairs out by the root. It is so overpowering and imposing that I can't detect anything else in there. 
I've had to put myself on a tongue transplant waiting list thanks to this beer. Right before it killed my last tastebud I recall a ton of bourbon with copius amounts of chocolate and coffee. They were however not copius enough to consider ganging up on the bourbon in an attempt to get some foreground action. The bourbon rules this beer with an iron fist and dissent will not be tolerated.
The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the intensity of the flavor and syrupy look. I think the bourbon must have scared the body away. In place of the body he has appointed his son, the esteemed Mr. Bourbon Burn, as Vice Chancellor of Black Tuesdayville.
All things considered, this is not a very drinkable beer but under threat of violence from the bourbon I have been instructed to wrap up this review on a positive note. It actually is pretty damn good in small doses but drinking a bottle would put a man six feet under.  1,463 charactersdrseamus, Feb 21, 2010

The appearance is incredible. It pours pitch black with a very impressive head formation in the Bruery tulip. It's got a thick consistency and is one finger high at first, and then recedes to a dark brown ring of very fine bubbles. Some film is left on the glass.
The aroma is gigantically malty with some liquor character coming from the bourbon. Rich chocolate with a touch of coffee, vanilla, oak, and alcohol form a very complex and strong nose. This is the strongest smelling beer I've smelled, but not the most boozy.
The first flavor match I thought of was java chip coffee ice cream. Charred wood, chocolate powder, vanilla, marshmallows and bourbon make up a strong and rich flavor. As it warms, the bourbon unfortunately comes through more, but so does molasses, brown sugar, white sugar, and maple. It's complex, interesting, and boozy. After every sip, it made me think more than it made me say "this is a good beer." I can appreciate these complexities and the uniqueness though.
Black Tuesday is the thickest beer I've ever had. The level of carbonation was higher than I expected, but it helped. It felt like I was drinking something with a lot of un-dissolved sugar, as there was obviously a lot of residual sugars in this. This made it a bit hard to drink. It became a chore towards the end, so I left a bit in the glass and went to sleep. It tasted surprisingly similar the next morning, with more of a marshmallow character to it.
I was very interested in trying this beer, and I liked it more than I thought. I'd like to try next years release, which I think will be an improvement over the first attempt. 1,740 charactersjeffthecheff, Feb 21, 2010

Super dark black with a tiny whispy of espresso foam.

Mouthfeel is thick and drinkability is great.

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I believe this one was generously traded by KJGAGNE (please correct me if I am wrong).
Large capped bottle poured into a snifter, divided three way. 
Pitch black as expected, deep and thick, impenetrable to light, with about a finger thick dark tan head that holds amazingly well for the ABV, and leaves chunks of lace on its way down. 
Aroma is very rich and nice, malty as expected, with layers and layers of sweet goodness. Vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, coffee, cookie dough all play a role.
Compared to the review below, from the same bottle, I have to say I did not notice the "power" that much; I would have actually guessed a 10-12% based on the taste, but the flavor itself is quite rich and powerful. Malty, sweet goodness plays a center role here, with dark chocolate, cofee, vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits and a hint of hoppiness nearly lost in the middle for good measure. 
Full bodied and creamy, with an average carbonation, this is one rich beer, but should be shared given the ABV. Drinkability is high all things considered, in this cold Wisconsin night.
Great beer, but IMHO, does not challenge either Dark Lord or Westy 12 for the first place in my cellar. 1,174 charactersbrdc, Feb 13, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had this with brdc and stoutsnipas courtesy of the generosity of brdc. Poured from a bottle into a snifter. It pours a thick deep black and forms a 1/2 inch mocha/red head that leaves a beautiful lacing of swirls. It is absolutely opaque when held to the light.
The aroma is fantastic. The first thing that was most prominent was the bourbon and vanilla components and a strong dark malty sweetness. A healthy dose of dark chocolate and an earthy hops scent is also there.
My first comment with the taste was, you can tell this has horsepower. There are hefty doses of dark chocolate, dark fruity sweetness, molasses, and bourbon. The hop character is a bit more citrus than in the nose. Oak and alcohol, as well as vanilla are definitely present but not overwhelming.
The mouthfeel was solid with a full body. The beer goes down quite smooth leaving a velvety texture with a pleasant dryness at the finish. Carbonation was reasonable and alcohol seemed to play a greater role here than in the taste.
This is a phenomenal beer. It is a little hard to drink primarily due to the intensity of flavors, as well as the ABV. It should be shared and could easily overpower just about any food. 1,191 charactersSykDoc, Feb 12, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Capped 750 ml bottle into several glasses on 2/3/10. Big thanks go to Deuane for busting this bad boy out on his 40th birthday as a special treat for us all to try. 
The pour on this is blacker than black, with about a ½ finger of angry, burnt, reddish, and just all around mean looking, mocha colored head. The retention is this is actually pretty sturdy for a barrel-aged effort, staying foamy on the sides and then more fizzy across the middle portion of the glass. Swirling this gets a steady rise of froth, which leaves a cascade of sticky foam and brown oils, which ever so slowly creeps down the sides of the glass. The aroma is literally, like a bomb going off in the nose. Cocoa, vanilla, brown sugars, herbal hops, burnt molasses, bitter dark malts, and fried smelling sugars, are all out in full force here. The Bourbon kind of hangs half in and half out here in the nose, mingling effortlessly up front with the other flavors and then showing itself all out in the back. As you can imagine, there is a good bit of heat present that singes the nose hairs a bit but when you're dealing with flavors this huge, it only adds to the general badassness of this dark and powerful bouquet. 
The taste is just as large and in charge as the aroma was and contains much of the same feel and flavors. Burned and blackened malts, espresso, green citric tones, extremely sticky and thick notes of chocolate, toffee, smoky molasses, brown sugar, plums, and black currants. Trust me, if it dark and sweet tasting, it's probably in here. Bourbon hangs over the other flavors like a hazy cloud, being prominent but still allowing the largeness of the other flavors to still shine. Understandably, the barrel character seems to get a bit lost in the shuffle at times but I can still pick up a good bit of earthy tannic dryness in the finish. The mouthfeel on this beer feels beyond full, with a massive creaminess to it that literally blows up in your mouth. All of that chewy sweetness and herbal character comes in off of the sides with a gooey slickness. I don't think that any description I can give can properly give the mouthfeel of this thing its due. The ABV on this is beyond warm. It's downright hot at times (with the Bourbon flavor adding some of that) but it's not nearly enough to make you think that this thing is pushing 20%. As a matter of fact, everything else about this beer is so huge and ridiculous, I didn't mind it one bit! Hell, throw some over-the-top alcohol in there as well! The more the merrier! 
Well after finally getting to try this, I can definitely see how just how polarizing of a beer this can be. Everything about this (OK, except maybe the look) is just outrageous and I think that one's enjoyment of this will depend on their like of these types of flavors or big Stouts in general, as they are totally taken to the nth degree here. I personally loved every drop of it! I will say that a little bit of this goes a long way. I had about 4-5 oz from the bottle and that was plenty for me. This was definitely a bottle meant to be shared by friends. 3,083 charactersKegatron, Feb 09, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to the generosity of Deuane for sharing this beast. Poured chilled into a 1/2 pint and allowed to gradually warm
A - Big and black appearance -the look is not quite viscous like black chocolate liquid, a ring of light tan is present and a bit of cream revives to a thin skin of a head when swirled. The lace hold on the glass when sips are taken
S - molasses, vanilla and toffee notes are high in the aroma w/ baked brownie and a light cocoa bean and dark roast coffee 
M -Moderately full feel, not quite syrupy. The feel is warming,yet not quite boozy w/ sugary feel and mild roasted texture w/ nutty and slightly smooth oily fee The beer seems spicy and dry as it finishes
T - The flavor is intense from the get-go, black currants and cocoa w/ dark brown sugar and slightly charred malt taste w/ woody accents and toasted grain w/ bitter herbal flavor and dark roast coffee-like acidity w/ lots of intense concentrated wort flavor like a dark malty molasses accented roasted elixir, both dry and sweet w/ spicy and alcohol flavors all very forward in the flavor, big beer that lets you know its a bruiser but doesn't knock you out with the first taste. The layers of malts and wood and alcohol all are in sync and leave ripples of full flavor on the tongue even after the taste
D - The drinkability is hard to compare to others of the style, very high quality and enjoyable to savor, yet not something you would want to pick up and drink all that often. For what it is it is highly drinkable. The flavors evolve very well and the abv while evident is still not close to what you might expect 19%+ to be when consuming this 1,641 charactersSlatetank, Feb 06, 2010
4.14/5  rDev -7.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A 750ml bottled shared by Deuane. Poured into my Selin's Grove wine glass. The stout appears a pitch black color akin to dark molasses. Repeated vigorous agitations only managed to produce a thin layer of dark ecru head. Nose and flavors consist of milk and bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, mellow bourbon notes, dark brown sugar/molasses, smoke and a bit of char, deeply caramelized malts, dark cherries, raisins, more chocolate and smoky bourbon. Smells a tad better than it tastes. Some, but certainly no where near enough alcohol heat to lead you to believe this beer is pushing 20%. Full bodied and rich, but rather sweet. The perfect bottle to split between 6 or more people. Thanks again D! 696 charactersClockworkOrange, Feb 06, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I owe wespatrick a lot for this one. He is a great trader and hopefully he is happy with what I sent him. We all know the story about the beer and the stories about what people thought about it. Reviewed from notes. 
The pour looks like used motor oil that came from my old 1980 Oldsmobile. It hits the glass and with a very aggressive pour produces a half finger head. The head has big fat bubbles, the whole thing is colored like a dark leather belt. The alcoholic legs are medium, but leave behind a grainy residue. The head leaves very fast and all that is left is a film over the brew that reminds me of 'The Swamp Thing'. No lacing and no head retention is why there is not a perfect score. 
The smell is divine. Moist chocolate cake, bourbon, raisins, plums, earth, Hersheys syrup, and lots of sugar. One of the best smelling beers I have come across. 
The taste comes off not very complex at first, but then the sugars give way to other characters. Dark fruits covered in Hershey syrup. Cinnamon with figs and bourbon in very small hints. Absolutely no alcohol in terms of harsh 20% ABV, just the smooth flavors of bourbon and earthy malts. Towards the end of the tasting it came to taste more like liquid chocolate cake. It was so sweet that if I had the choice, I would of paired it with some vanilla ice cream to make it the best dessert ever. The sugars are expected, but I have never had a beer with such an array of chocolate sugar flavors. Liquid cake, fudge, chocolate covered raising, but no bitter cooking cocoa. Nothing really bitter at all, just smooth sweet chocolate. I almost wish the bourbon was a bigger character, but this is a little aged to the point where it is starting the transformation into a different beer. Overall pleased but too sweet. 
The mouthfeel has a bit of alcoholic breath, and sits heavy on the palate. It has a grainy aspect that reminds me of over cooked fudge. Its sugars grind in between your teeth and pretty much put the sweet tooth in a head lock. I could of drank the whole bottle easily, but would of felt like I had just finished a whole batch of fudge by myself. A dessert beer at its best. 
The drinkability is good and very enjoyable. It is the perfect beer to share with someone for the third person that tasted this enjoyed it. She was a non beeradvocate that seems to like craft beer. She tasted it and very much enjoyed it. I think that this is the creme of the crop for some, and just okay for others. I can see why this got so much praise, because it does deserve it. It is extremely sweet and rich and decadent. It is a beer you pair with the finest dessert with the best of friends. I enjoyed it, but it is far from my favorite of the style.

4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks go out to moosington for the opportunity. Bottle poured into my Stone RIS tulip. This one was consumed after a long day of moving. High expectations.
A: Mostly black, but with reddish hues around the edges. The pour dropped a thin rim of foam that quickly dissapeared, and left no lace. However, it did leaves some nice legs, similer to a red wine.
A: I get the burbon straight away, followed by a vanilla, caramelly, sweetness. I also get a tartness from dried fruit, mainly prunes, raisins, and figs. A healthy amount of molasses is also present. 
T: This is where the brew falls apart for me. The burbon is overpowering, then it is followed by an overbearing sweetness. The person I shared the bottle with described it as burbon soaked prunes. And I would have to agree. I think there is just way too much going on here. I can appriciate the complexity, but the flavors do not meld well. I get prunes, raisin, figs, vanilla, caramel, and molasses. Next to no hop presence. It finishes with a warming as it goes down the throat.
M: Heavy body, but slick and oily. There is very little carbonation, so the beer seems to slip around the palate. 
D and overall impression: Drinkability is extremely low. The two of us had a rough time finishing the bottle. Overall I was very dissapointed with BT, I thought it was kinda a mess. Although I am happy I got to try this, I will not be seeking it in the future. Skal.
Re-review: 12/9/2011
Vintage 2011. Although I have changed my mind about this beer, I still don't believe it is a world class brew. The body is too light for the ABV, and it is very sweet and very boozy. It MUST be served at room temp! The flavors and nuances of the beer come out much better at 55-65 degrees. All in all, this is a huge beer, and one that I am glad I revisited. 1,805 charactersGtreid, Jan 31, 2010

Aroma- tobacco, chocolate, clean alchohol, earthy dirt, mineral, vanilla, molasses, oak, wood, roasted/charred malt. whiskey.
App - rich dark brown foam. creamy. black with mahogany edge. good retention. legs.
Taste- roasty, chocolate. caramel, lots of specialty malt and unfermentables. slightly funky off malt complexity - too many malts. delicious layered flavor. licorice. brown sugar. hops are balanced and not distinct. very sweet but also intense overall.
Mouthfeel- full, sweet and cloying if drank too fast. low fine carb. lots of clean alcohol- it is there but not harsh. syrup. could be better but great for a huge beer.
Overall- similiar to Bourbon County Stout but not as good. I would prefer an Abyss or BCS over this, but it is very good. The alcohol is strong so a 6 oz pour is enough. 858 charactershobojon, Jan 31, 2010

A - Dark pour with a khaki head that settles down.
S - A virtual whose who of smells greet you afer a pour into a snifter. Everything that you can imagine, toffee, caramel, candy sugar, chocolate, coffee, and smoke. The only reason it is not a 5 is that the booze is fairly apparent. I would equate this to Darkness or Dark Lord *2 with a strong boozy smell.
T - Given that it tops out near 20%, I have to give the mad scientiests mad props for this beer. It certainly has the booze behind it, but it is 20% for crying out loud. Actually, very pleasant given the ABV which is a real marvel to the craft of this beer. The booze is there, but it is still great.
M - Slick, chewy, oily and very satisfying.
D - You can split one of these 6 ways and still get a good experience. Try to drink this one by yourself and you will make a fool of yourself. You just can't have more than 4-5 ounces of this and get away with it.
It is a great beer and worthy of the acclaim. Other than the over the top boozy profile, it is REALLY good. Thanks to the above mentioned again for the hook-up. 1,303 charactersBeerisheaven, Jan 30, 2010

4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I love my brother...thanks again, pwoods, for sharing this one with me. 
Pours deepest chocolate brown, pretty much black. It is completely opaque - absolutely zero visibility in this beer. Not much head to speak of, just a few cocoa-colored spots suspended atop the liquid and a soft ring of foam that hugs the sides of the glass and leaves behind little watery spots of lace. 
Amazingly delicious aroma from this beer. The creamy bitterness of dark chocolate mingles with sweet cream. The bourbon is perfectly balanced in this beer - not masking the rest of the aromas of the beer while not assuming a background role. All the aspects of the aging are there in the nose, too - oak, vanilla, char - it smells incredible. 
Wow. If the aroma didn't convince me, the taste of this beer has guaranteed that it lives up to the hype. What a delicious and complex beer. The chocolate is intensely sweet - almost too sweet - and slightly bitter. There is a huge vanilla presence in this beer to a degree I haven't experienced with barrel-aged imperial stouts before. The creaminess is thick and full, and it compliments the bourbon nicely. It is sweet and nutty, somewhat like toffee. While the bourbon is present throughout the whole drink, it is especially pleasing in the aftertaste where the heat from the alcohol really presents itself and the bourbon lingers with a fruity, dark-cherry-like sweetness. Feel is creamy, well-carbonated and mouthfilling. It is impressively smooth with a nice bubbly finish. It leaves behind a slight stickiness on the palate and hot, drying alcohols of vapor in the mouth. The beer immediately warms the chest, and it continues to do so throughout the drink. A very pleasing experience in my opinion. 
Drinkability isn't exactly huge for any beer of this style, but this one especially hides its high (crazy high) ABV well. The alcohol feel and taste is definitely present, but it is so well-balanced by the full flavors and full feel of the beer that it goes down much too easily. 2,015 characterskels, Jan 25, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Sampled this courtesy of RJ (Grabbin2nd) and Richie (rhertan) at the central coast BA gathering last night. Thanks a ton guys! Following review written by Wiseman Nick, but includes thoughts from Wiseman Justin.
Poured into a snifter.
Appearance: Deep, dark brown, creamy head emerges from a pitch black body. Head descends to a bubbly crescent, and remains like that for the rest of the session. Looks super thick. A swirl coats the walls of the glass in oily residue, occasionally leaving a dab of lacing. N: 4.25; J: 4.5
Smell: Chocolate fudge, black licorice, roasted malt, dark chocolate, rose petals, rum, barbecue sauce, and a touch of bourbon to finish things off. There's much more in there too. All of the BAs sat around smelling this beer for a good ten minutes before even tasting it. Incredibly complex, rich, and harmonious. Alcohol is hidden very well. In Justin's mind, the nose on Black Tuesday is right up there with Firestone Eleven (our favorite smelling beer). I agree wholeheartedly. Sublime. N: 5.0; J: 5.0
Taste: Brownies, molasses, candy, chocolate frosting; tons of residual sugars. Not cloying though, not at all. Alcohol comes through in a sharp finish, but it doesn't taste anywhere near 19.5%. Vanilla and bourbon make their presence known as well, but in a more subtle manner. Chocolate and sweets are the lead players in this stout. Justin was stunned, and related this experience to the epiphanies felt by the children in "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." N: 5.0; J: 5.0
Mouthfeel: Thick, syrupy, rich, and warm. Finishes sticky and dry. Kind of gritty, but amazingly smooth given the ABV and body. Not at all harsh. Very well done. N: 4.5; J: 5.0
Drinkability: We both agreed that we could drink this all day long. Unbelievably drinkable for such a big beer. Delicious, complex, I can't say enough. This is the best beer both of us have ever had. N: 5.0; J: 5.0
Wiseman Nick: A+ (4.80)
Wiseman Justin: A+ (4.90) 1,959 charactersThreeWiseMen, Jan 25, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5What a rare treat it was to open this up.
It pours out a thin motor oil, it doesn't have the thickness you see in Dark Lord. A thin brown head tops off the top but fades away quickly. No lacing but it does leave a slight brown film on the glass. The bourbon aroma smacks you hard in the face even from a distance. There is also a dark fruit coming out with the chocolate. Almost no roast aroma. At first sip this beer tastes just like it smells. So well balanced. Bourbon, chocolate and a slight apple tart. Once your mouth is coated with that alcohol you can really get into this beer and see that it's just amazing. The year in the barrel has made this incredibly smooth. Which makes it one of the most drinkable Imperial Stouts I've had. The 19.5% ABV if correct, is hidden very well. One thing that I'm missing in this is the coffee or the roasted malts. 859 charactersbeerad666, Jan 24, 2010

A: Pitch black and thick. Nice head retention with the brown frothy head.
S: This is really the highlight of this beer. If you like beers like Firestone Walker 12 or SA Utopias, this beer will be a treat. The aroma is full of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, fig, and molasses.
T: Not quite as good as the aroma, but still impressive. I read a review where someone mentioned chocolate cake, and that is exactly what I got. There is also a strong bourbon presence here as well. 
M: Thick and sweet. Covers the tongue. 
D: A bit too boozy and sweet to easily drink a ton. Still a great beer. Damn did it hit me hard after a full glass. I would drink this 6oz at a time. 773 charactersraverjames, Jan 24, 2010

Motor oil pour yielding some bubbles and a quickly fading head. There's a good film as well.
Huge bourbon presence in the sniffer. Chocolate syrup, dark fruit a hint of wood. Bourbon is the stand out so far though.
Tastes exactly like bourbony cake batter! Extremely sweet and velvety. Brownies covered in Hershey's syrup and sugar. Again, this is VERY sweet! I can feel cavities forming.
There's no chance this is 19%, but there's also no way I could polish off the whole bottle by myself either. It's a very unique, dessert-forward RIS that should do some interesting things the longer it sits in the bottle. Good stuff! 714 charactersrudylaw, Jan 23, 2010

S: Bourbon, vanilla, roast, booze, oak, chocolate, coconut. Reminds me a bit of GI BCS and the Firestone Walker anniversary beers. Licorice and dried figs.
T: Sweeet, bourbon, roast and musty wet oak. Again I am reminded of BCS. Booze finally becomes apparent as it gets to room temp. Also huge dark fruit as it gets warm.

No real head as expected.. but it pours like motor oil.. coats the glass with every swirl.
Nose is thick with every element pronounced yet not very melded... dark chocolate syrup.. quite alot of bourbon.. raisins and dark cherries.... oaky in later pours.
Flavor is immediately reminiscent of Bourbon County but with alot more sweetness... boozy brownie batter .. vanilla sugar.. bits of coffee are drowned out by dark sweet fruits drenched in chocolate sauce.. Full bodied with a nice carbonation, but each sip makes me wanna go brush my teeth.. too cloying for my tastes.
Eric.. I appreciate the opportunity ... We had plenty of BT in Denver this year, and while I think it is very interesting, I still view it as more of a novelty.. That said, I REALLY want a bottle or two to hang on to for a few years and see how it melds... it seems like a bit of a mess right now.

3.9/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Bottled at The Bruery this last weekend, thanks to a certain photo shoot that went down on friday. Meant to get some more during the initiation party the next day, but I was having too good of a time drinking Two Dirty Hookers in the main room to make it over to the special pour room. Oh, well, the several ounces on friday was more than enough of this beast. Very thick black with a small head and leaves lots of syrupy coating on the cup. Massively intense aroma of chocolate and a shit ton of bourbon without the alcohol sharpness. A touch of oak, but mainly sweet bourbon and chocolate. Hugely thick and rich flavor. Very sweet and chocolate-bourbon flavored on the front on the tongue, but with a toasty and bitter roasty finish that manages a surprising balance. In the initial sip you don't really detect much alcohol, but it really comes out in the finish once it eats through the residual sugar on your tongue. Insanely thick and mouth coating in an almost gross way to be honest. An exceptional beer to be sure, but I can't really decide if I would ever be interested in it beyond a two-ounce sample every now and again. Total props to The Bruery for making a beer this tasty and envelope-pushing, but it really fills a tiny niche in the beer world. 1,260 charactersbulletrain76, Jan 19, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had 2 tastes at the Reserve Society Event. Poured into wine tasting glass.
A- Great black, dark brown edge color with a nice tan head that dissappears quicly. The body on this thing is just awesome, leaves a thick coating on the glass.
S- HEAVY. Sweet vanilla bourbon with nice chocolate malts, just a great beer!!!
T- Sweet sugar, chocolate, and some nice candied fruits, molasses, some very nice anise flavors. Then it begins to move to some smooth Oaky vanilla bourbon flavors, slight alcohol finish.
M- HUGE, medium/light carbonation, smooth creamy mouthfeel. Couldn't tell it was 19.5% alcohol.
D- Great but I don't think I could drink too much of this stuff, it's a meal in a bottle.
All in all I need to acquire more of this beer, like copius amounts of it, because this is just the best beer I have ever had. Thanks Patrick and The Bruery gang. 858 charactersSchmaltzy, Jan 18, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours out a foreboding black body with a wispy, wild, beige head.
Smell: Heavy concentrated, sweet-smelling aroma of dark malts with an equally strong, entrancing scent of quality bourbon. Mm-mmm!
Taste: Starts sharply, arrestingly sweet, then in rolls some dark fruits lusciously coated in creamy bittersweet chocolate ganache, brown sugar, and blackstrap molasses and spiced with some star anise. Even doses of vanilla and zesty, charred oak character. Additional dribble of prune juice and a chilled cup of Americano. Warming (though thankfully not boozy or harsh), sweet-tasting (but not cloying) finish.
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied. Medium carbonation. Particularly velvety mouthfeel.
Drinkability: A phenomenal, fierce brew! It's about as easily drinkable as something of this magnitude or degree of sweetness can be. Take it slow, bring some friends, and enjoy yourself. 888 charactersChainGangGuy, Jan 18, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Drinking it right now at The Bruery Reserve Society Initiation. Had 2 small couple oz pours in small wine taster glasses.
Pours a completely black with a light tan head. Head dissapated fas. No lacing.
Smells of dark fruits (figs and dates) and some roasty malt aromas mixed in. Slight alcohol aroma but I was surprized there was not more considering the ABV
taste is amazing. It's sort of Belgian mixed with stout. Alot of dark fruits and slight roastyness. Alot less than most other RIS's I have had. Pretty sweet but not super malty sweet. Almost like they used lactose sugar to sweeten instead of malt sweetness. The alcohol burn only comes in about a second or two after the swallow. Amazing for such a high ABV.
Mouthfeel is awesome. Not too thick. Perfect carb. Light but it it's perfect for the style.
Wouldn't drink a Ton because It is very rich tasting but one of the best beer I have ever had. Glad to try this. 927 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Jan 17, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Dark brown color, but with apparent brown hues, and viscous with a small beige head that leaves a fine ring of lacings. 
The aroma is intense with strong bourbon notes and with bold components of vanilla and almonds, wood and molasses. A nice roasted malt profile complements the bourbon character. 
The flavor is really sweet with lots of sweet components - molasses, sweet prunes and chocolate syrup. Lots of warming bourbon in the mouth coupled with well balanced roasted malt aromas. The intense flavors lead the way to a long and warming finish with notes of licorice, wood, alcohol and bourbon. The alcohol is definitely noticeable, but very integrated and here is a lot of flavors counterweighting it. Some bitterness in the finish as well, which is highly welcome. 
Very full body with a thick and viscous texture. The flavors in this one are really impressive, but the fat and creamy mouthfeel is actually the best part of the beer. 
Well, what to say about this one, probably the most hyped beer of 2009? In short, it's a really good beer and it is impressive how balanced it comes out despite the intensity and range of the flavors it showcases. Don't think it's in a league of its own though, there are some fine imperial stouts out there that surly could match it. 1,281 charactersricke, Jan 14, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Small amount had at the recent BA tasting in Portland. Someone earlier described this beer as liquid chocolate cake and I think that was my experience as well. There was almost no alcohol present in the nose, and exceptionally well hidden in the beer, where I also became another one of the people wondering how that happens at 19%. Everything else I have ever had in that range had an alcohol burn even after a few years of aging, but this didn't at all. The taste REALLY fills every corner of the mouth with a chewy sticky sweetness that is balanced by enough barrel flavors to keep it more than pleasant. The mouthfeel was the most memorable component of the beer for me. 
No way could anyone really enjoy a full bottle of this alone, so how about crowing Black Tuesday the best beer of all time in a new "dinner party dessert beer" category? 846 characterssquaremile, Jan 11, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 2I got a pretty small pour of this one as it was split many ways at the tasting, huge thanks to the man who brought it. In all honesty, I don't know if I'd even want more than a couple ounces. The aroma is all sorts of heady, with tons of bourbon, chocolate, and sugar going on. The taste is similar with lots and lots of sweetness. Some underlying chocolate and vanilla from the bourbon. I've said it before, but never has it applied more - this one's a sipper. The first thing that came to mind for me was the similarity to bourbon county stout just from the full-on rush of sensation. The tastes are similar (although this one's a little more sweetness and chocolate and a little less outright bourbon) and since I'm a huge fan of BCS that can only be a good thing. Glad I got a chance to try this very special beer. 818 charactersPawel, Jan 11, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Opened this bottle and shared it with friends. One including BA DwnTwnBwn and ebingen.
A - pours a viscious thick black. As I poured it into my tulip, the oily slick beer grabs the inside of the glass as it pours in. A nice inch of tan bubbly head stays at the top. Not much lacing, but the beer leaves a constant thin head at top.
S - chocolate, bourbon, sweet molases. All those flavors and more come in the nose. So much going on. Another wiff hints of coffee ad licorice. Amazing.
T - wow. So much going on in this beer. First taste hits with brown sugar. After that comes slight coffee. Then, the hint of dark melted chocolate blasts it's way in and is followed by the taste of ripe cherries. Damn, the flavor profile contues to develop as it warms. Bourbon now, slight vanilla, a pleasing bourbon burn pleasantly coats your throat at warmer serving temperature. This beer is a slice of heaven in a glass. What you expect in such a strong, viscous complex stout is here. 
M - perfectly carbonated. This beer is thick, chewy, and sharp. The beer fills up your mouth, and the flavor explodes with the sticky beer hitting every flavor receptor. Perfect.
D - for a 19.5% abv beer, the drinkability is threw the roof. So damn drinkable. Every sip males me want more. Can't get enough.
O - wow, even better than the first time I had this beer. So good. Something everybody should try. 1,389 charactersabecall98, Jan 10, 2010

A - The beer pours a complete Obsidian black. Its beautiful how it seems to not only adsorb light but it reflects it, much like the rock. Amazingly small bubbles in dark khaki head
S - Starts off a clean sweetness deep dark chocolate the a wonderful black cherry. Back round notes of honey and vinilla come through as well. 
T - Perfect complexity dark dry chocolate that moves to dreamy dark fruits. Roast malts and bitterness finish n an ever satisfying finish. There are subtle notes of Vanilla and Honey which enhance the flavor profile. As the beer warms it brings out further surprises of Bourbon and oak. The Honey and sweet malt stand up a bit more but the chocolate and cherries still stand on top. 
M - Even well balanced medium body, thick flavor ebbs to a soft finish
O - The reason for the perfect review is because of the vibrancy of each flavor and its how each note does not over power the next. This is one of the best beers I've ever had. 1,015 charactersDwnTwnBwn, Jan 10, 2010

Review #200!
P: Completely light-rejecting with barely a few stray bubbles on top, even after an extremely vigorous pour. All that was left was a micro-thin halo on top and some dark brown stains on the side of the glass. After a vigorous swirl, however, I was able to conjure up a 1/2 inch soapy head of dark cappuccino-colored foam. I was really hoping to see a big dollop of foam on top of this beast, but at 19.5% I guess it's understandable. The score reflects my slight disappointment in this department, though. 
A: This is, undoubtedly, the best aroma from a RIS I've come across yet! The bourbon isn't at all boozy and messy like some of the other barrel-aged stouts out there. Instead, it's really refined and well-integrated into the rest of the profile of the nose. Other aromas bursting from the glass include: deeply roasted malts, chocolate fudge, maple, wood, vanilla, and dark fruits. Awesome!
T: The first sip reveals an impossibly deep roasted malt bill that just envelops you in its flavor. Oozing from all 20 of the malts supposedly present here is chocolate fudge cake, vanilla, caramel, molasses, leather, maple wood, and of course, bourbon. Much more dark fruits are in here than I expected to find that remind me of dates, figs, and black cherries that add yet more complexity. Once again, the bourbon isn't alcoholic and messy on the palate, but it does warm the back of the throat, chest, and belly with each and every swallow. Finishes sweet and leaves a sweet aftertaste that hangs on for an eternity. If this ain't a 5, I don't know what is.
M: The term "full-bodied" just doesn't do it justice. Black Tuesday is incredibly thick, glassy smooth, perfectly creamy, and absolutely chewy as hell. There is no liquid that has ever passed my lips that even comes close to feeling this incredibly viscous and oily. 
Notes: After standing in line for 4 1/2 hours in a dark, cold, wind-swept alley to obtain this beer, I became increasingly skeptical if the beer could ever live to all the hype. As hard as I tried to find a chink in the Black Tuesday armor, the only thing I could come up with was the lack of head after the initial pour. Smells incredible, tastes phenomenal, and makes Goose Island Bourbon County Stout feel like a porter! As for its drinkability, the 19.5% is hidden so damn well that drinking an entire bottle is not nearly as cumbersome as it might sound in theory. No doubt it's a sipper to be reckoned with, but it went down much more easily than I thought it would. Two thumbs way up! 2,579 characterssweetbrew82, Jan 05, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I brought this bottle and shared it with friends at beerloco's house on New Years Day.
Appearance: First off let me mention that the appearance experience really starts when you look at the bottle. It's one sexy label. Beer pours opaque with 2 fingers of tan foam that shows some retention and lots of lace.
Smell: Loads of bourbon, molasses, cocoa powder, deep roasted malts (20 of them to be precise!) Really pungent and really impressive. The nose makes you want to just dive right in to the tasting :)
Taste: Huge flavors that are blended extremely well in my opinion. The 19.5% abv pulls a Jimmy Hoffa on you, as it's nowhere to be found! I mean come on, how do you conceal 19.5% alcohol so well? I'm impressed. Loads of bourbon, roasted malt, vanilla, molasses, and perhaps a touch of brown sugar.
Mouthfeel: This one is thick and syrupy but comes off so creamy! Don't let the thickness perturb you as this beer is smooth! 
Drinkability: If it wasn't for the well hidden 19.5% abv I'd give this one a 5.0 for this category as well. The flavor profile is great, the mouthfeel fantastic, and you just want more of it each time you sip it!

3.46/5  rDev -22.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Appearance: Rich, dark, pour, incredibly thick. Completely coats the glass, and nice head as well.
Smell: Boozy notes of prunes, plums, brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, and chocolate. Not as much bourbon as I had hoped for although the alcohol is very hot. Definitely thick, but not particularly appitizing. Too sweet.
Taste: The 09 did a good job of hiding the alcohol but in the 2010 the booze smacks you in the face like a freight train. Big booze, plums, prunes, brown sugar, vanilla, tobacco, oak, coffee, chocolate, lots and lots of malt. Biggest negative is that it is way too sweet, which, combined with the over-present vanilla, booze heat, and alcohol thinness, detracts greatly.
Mouthfeel: Thick, but not silk/satin smooth. The 09 was decent but the alcohol in the 10 made it feel too hot and runny.
Drinkability: Hard call here, not drinkable in the sense that you normally think, as in it goes down easy, but it is "drinkable" for a 19.5% beer. However, I am going to go with general drinkability, as "highly drinkable for a 19.5%" beer sounds similar to "particularly tasty meal as far as rusty nails go."
Overall a good brew, but not a stand-out for the style. Certainly the "biggest" but that does not mean "best" as well, at least in my book. A good exercise in over-loading each part of the brewing process with malt and then tossing it in a barrel, but nothing I would need to try again - similar to seeing the bearded lady, etc. I've had the 09 and 2010, the 10 was much hotter and the alcohol made it feel thin. 1,536 characterscraytonic, Jan 02, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Cracked open my bottle with a few fellow BAs.
A: Pitch black body with absolutely no light shining through the edges when held to the light. Moderate dark khaki head. Holds on for a short while before forming a slight skim which pools around the edges. Very spotty lacing. You can see legs after a swirl in the snifter due to the high abv.
S: Bourbon dominates the initial nose. You get quite a bit of oak and vanilla as well before sweet caramel, chocolate and coffee take over. A lot is going on here but it is neither muddled nor overwhelming. The nose is in perfect harmony and is a nice prelude to each sip.
T: While the nose is quite impressive... it betrays the depth and complexity of the flavors that treat the tongue. Layers and layers of malty goodness are present here. Lots of caramel, dark chocolate, coffee, espresso, molasses, brown sugar, and some roasted nuts. The nice thing is the subtlety of the bourbon which is present throughout, but is not overpowering with its vanilla and oak contributions.
M: I found this to have the ideal weight. Moderate to heavy body with a nice even creamy silkiness. A nice lingering finish really lets the flavors sit on the palate to be explored.
D: With this much flavor and alcohol, this beer should not be this enjoyable. The bottle was split three-ways and it was divine. A truly amazing accomplishment from the Bruery. The hype was more than met here which is a really nice bonus. 1,443 characterscallmemickey, Jan 01, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I drank this from a 22oz bottle into my Rochefort chalice for New Years Eve. 
The beer is very black, only showing the tiniest bit of brown in the light. The head is dark tan, rises about one finger. It looks full and creamy but it is sadly gone in about a minute only leaving a ring of head around the glass. The lacing is poor as is the carbonation.
The aroma is very malty, sweet and enticing. It smells wonderful and begs you to come back again and again. Vanilla dominates the nose, with notes of candy, and raspberries. This sweetness is balanced out by a touch of oak, bourbon and alcohol at the end. 
The tase is very matly as well, extremely sweet to start. There is a ton of vanilla and light chocolate on the front, in the middle you get oak and it finishes with a medium alcohol, specifically bourbon taste. 
The feel is little lighter than I'd hope for, not watery but not great. The finish is nice as tickles your throat and warms it up on the way down, totally from alcohol. 
The drinkablility is nice, you taste the tiniest bit of alcohol but that's to be expected with a 19.5% abv. 
Overall, this beer is very good and definitely lives up to all the hype. The 2009 is drinking great right now, aging does wonders. 1,236 charactersjrallen34, Jan 01, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Thanks gford217 for bringing this to the amazing tasting at Brick Store Pub last night. Also much thanks goes out to portia99 and sonicdescent for generously hooking me up with bottles. What a treat!
Thick and syrupy pour into a tasting glass - appearance is black with a thin dark brown head.
Smell is heavy on the bourbon but there is also so much chocolate, vanilla and molasses.
Taste is amazing - there is so much going on that it's hard to pinpoint all the flavors. There is obviously a lot of bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla, but in the background there is brown sugar, tobacco, leather, dark fruits (plum, cherry), coffee.
Mouthfeel is exceptional - it's so thick that it coats the mouth very well, and the creaminess is wonderful.
Drinkability is high considering it's over 19% ABV - that is hidden very well. However, I don't think I could drink more than 8 oz of this beer in one sitting. This is a beer meant for tastings since 4oz is plenty.
Overall, this is an exceptional barrel aged stout and one of my favorites now. 1,033 charactersbmanning, Dec 30, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Shared this 3 ways so i had a very generous pour courtesy of myself as usual.First impression was thinking this tasted like a 08 Darkness on steroids.Then it seemed more like a 02 DFH World Wide Stout..This one packed a punch in a warming way. Made my ears warm. Heavy syrupy flavors of molasses and grain sugars abound throughout. So many flavors coming through it's hard to pick out at times exactly whats going on. Very good and highly drinkable and hides the 19% alc. very well but does have the warmth you would expect from such a high content. This is more like a liqueur than a beer. Would be interesting to let this one sit for a few years and try it again..I think I will with the other bottles I have! Seek one out and enjoy if your lucky enough to land one. 768 charactershrking, Dec 28, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well it certainly took me long enough to find the time to crack this one open! I figured christmas night would be just the right time to split this one among the family, though I have to admit I ended up drinking half the bottle myself. Served at around fifty degrees and poured into several tasting glasses, this one was consumed on 12/25/2009.
The pour was brilliant and menacing. Rich and dark as night, no light could penetrate this one at all. Sinister looking with a huge tan head that rose up out of the depths and settled over the top with huge amounts of lacing. At this point I am scared, but I push on. 
Aroma is brilliant and huge. Rich bourbon notes are immediatly felt. Just larger then life from the get go. Huge notes of booziness, rich vanilla soaked touches, tons of chocolate and rich molasses like notes, the aroma is soo thick you could drown in it. As I take the first sip I am blown away by how big this is. Decadence is defined in this beer. It is so viscous and huge, it almost defies words. Huge flavor of rich chocolate and huge vanilla and bourbon flavors. For 19.5 percent there was no way at all to tell. Maybe 10 percent or so, but wow. Soo smooth and complex I am completely in awe of this creation. 
Overall I am really left rather speechless by this. I had my hopes dampened coming into this one as people have said it was not worthy of the hype, but I beg to differ, it was worth every bit of it. This is quite simply the biggest, baddest, strongest RIS I have ever come across and it deserves its title. Still in awe of this one. 1,568 charactersmikesgroove, Dec 26, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review #600
Poured into a mini snifter glass.
Pours a small tan head. Decent retention for the small layer. Color is pretty much black, but around the edges it is has copper hue to it.
Aroma: Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak, raisins, cherries, plums. It smells hot, but very nice.
Taste: A little hot off the top. Lots of bourbon. It's not bad fore the high abv. Vanilla, oak, and tons of dark dried fruits: raisins, cherries, and plums. Chocolate and earthy hops.
Mouthfeel: A little hot, huge malty beer. A little creamy as well. Full bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. I was told this beer had no heat with it, but it brings a lot to the table, granted that it should, being 19.5%.
EDIT: After being able to drink a lot more of this beer at the Bruery, I have to adjust my scores. This beer is really amazing and I wanted to keep drinking it. Superb.
Overall, this beer is good, but I can see it getting a lot better with age on it. People claim that the abv doesn't show at all, well I am going to have to call that a lie. There is definitely a fair amount of heat showing in this beer. I will be reevaluating this beer once I get to try it again with some age on it. 1,188 charactersmothman, Dec 24, 2009
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Many Thanks to Phil for providing this rarity and for hosting the recent tasting. 
An aggressive pour releases liquid as black as Wesley Snipes into my tulip glass, sitting below a tight dark tan head of a half finger height. Black Tuesday has very nice wine-like legs, but no real lacing to speak of. 
I could smell the beer as it poured. The aroma is clearly boozy, but it's not very similar to many bourbon-barrel aged beers I have had before. It's sweet with every type of chocolate you could think of in addition to the barrel characters which are surprisingly in the background (balance). Dark, rich 90% cocoa and booze soaked fruits combine with a hints of oily french roast and molasses. These elements are evident in the taste as well, but in generally smaller doses.
Flavor opens up with an intensely sweet chocolate cake exploding with a molten dark choloate interior. Someone asked,
"What's that thing with chocolate inside of another chocolate?" 
"Oh, a Truffle?" 
"Yeah, that's it!"
This is like the best chocolate cake you have ever had but you bite into it only to discover that there's an even better chocolate cake inside it. Decadent. 
Don't get me wrong though, the booze is apparent. It's very noticeable and anyone telling you otherwise probably lives within a 5 mile radius of Placentia, CA. I would guess probably 10-12% abv, which was about what the other tasters mentioned. 
Having said that, this is beer actually got worse as it warmed. All of my beer knowledge indicates that the exact opposite should happen, and that deeper flavors and subtleties should erupt as a beer warms to room temperature. As black tuesday warmed, it only became less drinkable (more alcohol apparent) and it's viscous mouthfeel became borderline overbearing. Yes, this is a very drinkable beer for it's (supposed) 19.5% ABV, but you couldn't (read: wouldn't want to) drink more than 3 or 4oz anyway. 
Overall, this is a very impressive beer and as much as I want to hate it, I just can't. I am glad to have had the chance to try it, and would recommend that bottles be shared at cooler temps (closer to 40&#730;F) between at LEAST 6 People. 2,156 charactersIneedabeerhere, Dec 23, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Boy am I pissed off that this was one of the three reveiws i lost from the weekend crash. Atleast I have notes but this wont nearly be as long. Bottle courtesy of Shogokawanda
A: It was black with only mild amount of dark brown carbonation on top. Not as thick as I thought it would be but still pretty dark.
S: As soon as the bottle was cracked, I could smell milk chocolate. The bourbon was milder than I expected which was good, but there was no real roastiness in the aroma. Sweet chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, and vanilla are also there, but I prefer my stout to have some hint of roasted character
T: I wanted to hate this, i really did, but i couldnt. The first sip was amazing. It started out chocolaty then transitioned to a bit of bourbon with hints of wood coming through and then as it went down, amazing flavors of coconut and almond. Dammit why did it have to taste really good.
M: Good amount of body and definitely thick without being to thick, if that makes sense. The bourbon did add some booziness, but i found that it added to the overall experience of the beer.
D: I, as did others, sat on this one for quite some time. I couldnt even think about having one all to myself, or even half a bottle at that. It did live up to the hype and I am very happy to have had the opportunity to try it 1,318 charactersmikey711, Dec 23, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Got a chance to try this awesome beast thanks to ShogoKawada's trading prowess and our "Rush Hour Tasting" of epic magnitudes. I had to back log a bunch of beers so I could write this up for my 200th review as I'm trying to do something epic for each centennial review. My review will be a little less in depth as usual as I was truing to scribble little notes into my notebook and enjoy/savor the awesomeness of the beer at the same time.
A: Super dark rich thick heavy pitch black color. Pours like molasses almost. A light head and carbonation.
N: Nose is loaded with chocolate up the wazzoo, and I'm talkin all kinds of chocolate, bakers chocolate, mild chocolate, dark chocolate, malted chocolate. Some bourbon and oak make their way through it's lusciousness. A little boozy on the nose, but not close to what I would expect for 19.5%. It adds some malty aromas, but not overwhelming.
T: Taste just blows it away. Is so rich and thick. Very sweet with some maple and molasses and a huge malty sweetness. Some bourbon flavor permeates, but doesn't overpower like the chocolate and sweetness. Which brings me to the chocolate. Again, just about every chocolate you can dream of coming out the taste of this. It adds a nice stoutty flavor too with more earthy charred malt flavor. Add some roasted malts to it and you got a nice mix going. Still somewhat boozy but not what you would expect for 19.5%. As it warms more alcohol comes out a bit, the sweetness lessens, your mouth gets used to the chocolate, and some fruity qualities come out. Even a touch of toasted coconut comes through, as well as some fig and plum maybe. 
M: So rich and thick my mouth is partying thinking it died and went to beer heaven. It's like liquid velvet blended with the smooth skin of a baby's ass. Some warming alcohol, but not overbearing.
F: Finish is still very sweet, although it seems to lessen on sweetness as it warms but ups the boozy taste. Although I would still put this beer at 10-12% abv so this blend really hides it well. Some bitterness comes out on the finish probably a combination of some hidden hops as well as the earthiness of the starched malts and stout like qualities. 
This beer basically lived up to the awesome hype. I was a little worried that it wouldn't, and we all wanted it to bomb out so we could downgrade the score. Instead it did the opposite and made is happy but sad at the same time. I would love to see how this does with a few more years under it's belt. I hope they continue to make batches of this and make higher quantities. The only difficult part of it was the sweetness that was a little overbearing at times, and it was hard to finish, even slowly, but that just pushes the sipping aspect of it, which is very thankful as it masks the 19.5% so well you could just put it back much easier otherwise. 2,838 charactersjlindros, Dec 22, 2009

A- Brown, not black, a deep dark brown, and there's a head! It's about half a finger, the bubbles themselves are brown, and they are thin-walled and stick like sea foam.
S- Mild coffee astringency, sweet brown sugar, caramelized/molasses, a bit of bourbon as well.
T- BOURBON! Semi-sweet chocolate. Like a Hershey bar or hot cocoa mix. Molasses, coffee, almond paste. Tastes like a rich chocolate truffle, boozy, of course.. 
M- This is great... until it warms up. Then the alcohol comes through even stronger. Oppressive, almost. 
D- Moderate. A little goes a LONG way. I enjoyed my first glass, and my second glass sat for about 3 hours before I mustered up the strength to finish it. 789 charactersShogoKawada, Dec 22, 2009
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Hoppymeal for bring a bottle of this to the Kuhnhenn Solstice tasting....obviously this is a white whale for 90% of BA's right now so I was excited to try a sample of this big stout.
poured a 4 oz. sample into a 10oz Kuhnhenn snifter
poured jet black with a small dark tan head that disappated quickly leaving a slight lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet w/ hints of molasses, vanilla, bourban, oak and alcohol. The taste is much of the same. This is a big sweet stout, which is to be expected with such a high ABV. Shockingly enough the booze was fairly well hidden, but the sweetness was a bit much for me and cancelled out some of the subtle flavors that could make this beer great. I think with a few years of aging this could be a spectacular heavy and complex stout. I am certainly glad to have tried this ale...I've always felt as though this was an over hyped beer, but after trying it I can honestly say that it is a supreme effort at a high alcohol stout and reminds me a big of DogFish Head's World Wide Stout which is one of the finest ales to age IMHO. Good Job to the Bruery and I hope to try this one again in a few years when some of the sweetness dies out. Thanks again Derek! 1,209 charactersHopHobo, Dec 21, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5**revisited the 2009 vintage at a recent tasting over the holidays. The flavors and booze have really come together and the alcohol is not as dominant as it was a year ago. I enjoyed my pour much more and went back for another. 
Big thanks to Scotty (aka hooliganlife) for bringing this to our STLHops Tasting and for Mike for hosting. Share among several people...I got a good 5oz pour into my tasting glass.
A - Pours black, slim tan-colored head which disipiates into nothingness. The look turns straight back quickly after the pour. no really lacing or retention to speak of, just midnight black in a glass.
S - Chocolate and boozy notes, some burnt malts, molasses. Mostly a mix of sweet and boozy, kinda messy compared to most other stouts that are considered the "crem de la crem". Nothing near mind-blowing here at all.
T - Chocolate syrup, lots and lots of booze, roasted malts, a hint of oak. The booze pretty much dominates this. Although it's hot, I could not tell that this is 19.5% and if I had to guess, I'd say 12% or so. Although the alcohol is well-hidden, there's still a bunch of it and combined with the sweet notes, it makes this beer messy.
M - Full bodied, a big beer, rich and smooth. Probably the best thing about this beer is the feel. I like the way this coats the palate...it sticks with you.
D - My 5oz (approximate) was way more then enough for me. I was done with this one after my initial taste and I don't think I could have gone back for seconds (or enjoyed it). I've had many other stouts that I consider to be superior to this brew. Although it's good, I don't consider it to be great. 1,628 charactersSean9689, Dec 20, 2009

huge bourbon, dark cherry, vanilla, licorice, and molasses
very sweet, the sugar lined my gums afterward. lots of bourbon but in a very sweet way, not much heat at all for a 19.5% ABV. bits of molasses and vanilla with slight hints of oak and dark cherry. bourbon and sugar dominates.
hands down the thickest stout i have ever had. it lined my mouth and then some. 
i was impressed, it lived up to the hype. the ABV was well hidden although in the back of my head I knew it was there. it was a tad too sweet though, that as the only flaw i found. i would drink this again but with other people. 19.5 will wreck you. 678 charactershooliganlife, Dec 20, 2009
3.46/5  rDev -22.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 5 |  overall: 2.5Thanks to hooliganlife for bringing this to a great tasting.
Ok, let's get down to it.
Poured the most amazing stout I've ever seen, just pitch black goodness. Slight off white creamy head that dissolved quite quickly. Kinda disappointing but I'm sure that's the ABV. Smelled of dark German chocolate cake, deep doses of roasted barley, coffee, bourbon, charcoal, wood, and lots and lots of booze. Taste was really disappointing. I was expecting this beer to make me weak in the knees, instead I got a wonderfully flavored imperial stout overpowered with booze. I know for a beer of this strength you would expect some booze, but I think that the key to any good beer is balance and this beer doesn't have it. What flavors I could pick out were good - chocolate cake, sugary syrupy molasses, oak vanilla, and coffee. Mouthfeel was great for this monstrous beer, I had to scrape the sugar coating off my tongue when I was done. As far as the drinkability, My 3oz pour was plenty, in fact maybe a little too much.
Did this live up to the hype for me? No, not really. I'm glad I got to try it and if I came across the opportunity to trade or buy a bottle for a reasonable price I would, because I'd like to age this and see if a year or two can mellow this out. If the booziness can tone down a little, this beer would be out of this world. 1,339 charactersFweezle, Dec 20, 2009

A: Very Very dark black pour. Nice tall mocha colored head. Nice retention and some leggy lace.
S: Very bold roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. No real oak or vanilla.
T: Malty goodness, but boy is this sweet. We are not talking darkness 08, but this is a sweet beer. There is tons of chocolate malt, with notes of molasses, dark fruit, and toffee. It is boozy with strong notes of bourbon as well. Once again I don't pick up oak or vanilla. I realize a ton of malt was used here, but it is a bit too sweet for my taste. Would like to see the other components of the barrel as well.
M: Very full in body, rich, sweet, slight boozy burn in the finish.
D: All that being said for 19% it is damn drinkable. Great Great beer, was not epic though. 820 characterstpd975, Dec 20, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I've now tried this three separate times, and last night, in celebration of my college graduation (along with my roommate's as well) we had a massive bottle opening, with this being the first.
Appearance: Dark. Pitch black with amber-brown highlights that block all light even from a close source. Among the darkest beers I've ever had SRM wise, it's just darker than dark. Head is a little latent, cropping up at the end of the pour, and lacing thickly as it loosens up.
Smell: Whew, bourbon, chocolate, prune-raisin, cherry, roasted and toasted malts, and a hint of sweetness on the back-end, but predominantly bourbon and chocolate. Boozy character is there as well, but mostly just as more bourbon.
Taste: So, so much smoother than the smell gives the impression of. Bourbon is mellow and soft, accenting the big chocolate, roasted malt sweetness. The dark fruits come in strongly in the aftertaste, and finishes with an intensely complex dark bourbon sweetness. Whew.
Mouthfeel: Second smoothest beer I've ever had, only to its counterpart of Chocolate Rain, which I still think has a better flavor. Carbonation is nice here though, and all three times I've had BT I've appreciated the carbonation's presence in helping add some liveliness to the incredibly thick and heavy body. Still, just so smooth.
Drinkability: It's essentially 40 proof. It's not easy to drink more than a few glasses of this, that's for sure. In that way, drinkability is low. In the way of masking the ABV, seemingly clocking in around GI BCS' 13%, it's eminently so. Catches up to you quickly, too. Altogether, no doubt one of the best beers I've ever had, and I don't even really love bourbon barrel beer. It's not the hype that's made this beer world-famous, but the smoothness, complexity, and fantastic flavors of a beer that clocks in at almost 20% ABV. 1,844 charactersnomomentwasted, Dec 12, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Sampled at yet another outrageous tasting over at Dyan's place the other evening. Many thanks again kind sir for cracking open this beauty the other night.
BT pours a blackish brown color with very good head retention and lots of sticky lacing all around. The nose on this bad boy is quite profound, though at least initially, the alcohol was a bit too noticeable. However, that dissipated fairly quickly and I got dark chocolate, milk duds, leather, licorice, dark fruits and a hint of tobacco. Just so much going on with this beer. Flavors on the palate are even better IMHO, with the rich, sweet, chocolate, maple syrup and vanilla front and center. This is a very, very sweet beer, but I never felt as if it was too sweet and cloying on the palate. There's just so much flavor in this excellent beer, and that flavor profile is huge and intense. Mouthfeel is very rich and sweet, with a long, long finish. Carbonation is fairly low, which works well with this beer. Drinkability is the only area where I feel as if I have to deduct some points. This beer is so sweet and boozy, I cannot imagine drinking more then 4 or 5 ounces at a sitting. We split Dyan's bottle amoung 6 good size guys, and we could barely polish off the bottle. It's absolutely the sort of meal that I'd want to drink after a beer (weak joke there), and then only a splash in a nice size brandy snifter. 
A couple of thoughts about this beer. This is an extremely impressive beer, one that was an absolute treat to sample. That being said, it really doesn't have any place in my life. Like the DFH WWS and 120 IPA, this is the sort of beer you can drink once in a blue moon, with no need for repeated applications. Not sure when, if ever, I'll want to try this beer again. 1,749 charactersJohn_M, Dec 11, 2009
3.32/5  rDev -25.7%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3I've been looking forward to trying this beer since it's been so hard to get. These California traders really have this beer nailed down. I couldn't get any of this beer in a trade, so I bought my bottle from the website that BA won't let me mention here.
Appearance: Really dark chocolate-like but the opacity dissipates into a brown hue if you angle the glass and look through the light making me think it's more of a porter than a stout.
Putting my nose down to the rim of my snifter glass, the bourbon is too pronounced which overpowers the chewiness, fruitiness, and chocolate smell. It smells sweet like cherries and dark fruits but I can smell the alcohol coming through.
This taste like bourbon soaked chocolate covered cherries, raisins, figs, bready, lots of flavor but the mouthfeel is thin which the appearance hinted at. Something about this beer reminds me of an aged World Wide Stout with bourbon-added but not integrated well.
I honestly didn't finish my bottle. Two glasses was enough for me. I'm glad I had friends that I was able to share this bottle with. Because of that, I consider it's drinkability to be low. This would be better as a sipper for an after dinner drink like how ports and liqeuers are served with dessert or by the fireplace. 
All in all, there's some complexity here to make it one of the higher-rated beers but don't be fooled by the hype, which sadly may be its downfall. If you get a chance to try this beer, I suggest you ignore the hype and approach it without expectations for what it is. 1,539 charactersMysterySwirl, Dec 08, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5After having a (really, really) small sample at the HTOD, I was able to try this again at a more formal tasting where I got a good amount to taste.
Pours a deep brown/black- with a small head. Smell is ok- nothing exceptional- strong roasted wood smell coupled with some chocolate and molasses.
Taste is great- You can taste the bourbon paired with the chocolate and it goes together very very well. However my only qualm is that for a thick looking beer it drinks very very thin and makes for a average mouthfeel. However this does help cover the massive ABV. 
Overall I was slightly disappointed with this beer- with all this hype I was expecting a mental/sensory explosion- needless to say, I didn't get it.
11/15/2012 *Update* 
Now I've had this more than several times, I'm inclined to bump up the scoring. When this first came out, there was this massive aura of HYPE WHALZ around this and it negatively impacted how I , along with several other people viewed tis beer. As it has progressed through the years and lessened that hypeness, it has grown to hold its own among other great BA imperial stouts and I can safety say it's a beer I'd seek out. 1,159 characterskunstdrache, Dec 07, 2009
3.54/5  rDev -20.8%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5After having Black Tuesday at the HOTD dock sale, I looked forward to opening this bottle at a tasting with friends last night so I could give it a proper review.
The beer appears black in my glass fading into a clear brown hue on the edges as I hold it up to the light. I expected it to be a little thicker and more opaque in it's color.
It smells sweet like dark fruits, roasty and oaked. The taste is just like how it smells. There's a dark fruity, bourbon, and vanilla presence that becomes more prominent. Definitely some woody dark chocolate and caramel notes. The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected but the flavors are integrated well which helped mask the 19.5% ABV. 
It's quite good and extremely drinkable but is it the best? No, IMHO, but it is definitely one of the better stouts out there. 807 charactersbgramer, Dec 07, 2009

Pours black with dark brown highlights as the beer clings to the side of the glass and a thin brown head that quickly recedes into a smooth and oily top. A nice swirl leaves brown legs on the sides of the glass.
Smells of roasted malts with hints of tobacco, vanilla, bourbon, and dark chocolate, more or less in that order.
Tastes similar to how it smells. Mild roasted malt flavors up front are overtaken quickly by vanilla, bourbon, and dark chocolate. Midway through the sip hints of tobacco enter into things but stay in the backseat. The ending is mildly boozy and bitter. The alcohol is absurdly well hidden.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a very smooth thickness with soft and grainy carbonation.
Drinkability is great. I finished my glass with absolutely no problem and could have entirely too much more.
Overall I have to say that it lived up to the hype. I think the best thing about this beer is how well integrated all of the flavors are while managing to not taste overly hot. Not the best beer I've ever had but it certainly has to be part of the conversation. 1,118 charactersglid02, Dec 07, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have had the pleasure of having this beer both on tap as well as out of the bottle. It is amazing both ways. The most recent time was a couple nights ago we opened a bottle for a friends birthday. The beer was a beautiful dark chocolate color with a nice head to it. All of the aromas from chocolate to bourbon were present as you take your sip from the glass. Even though the ABV is about 19, it goes down smooth and without a bite. Personally I am not a stout drinker, but this is the best beer I have had. It is fantastic! 527 charactersFishScales, Dec 04, 2009
3.43/5  rDev -23.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5Sometimes a review kills a movie. In fact, often it is hard for a movie ever to live up the incredible hype critics bath it in. I am sure, in these instances - we walk out with a down feeling on what was actually a pretty good movie - but we were expecting Raging Bull, and got it didn't deliver.
Anyway, that aside - we opened the bottle with a certain level of excitement - a definite pop in your step if you will. But something didn't feel right for me, it didn't seem like an authentic "holy shit" moment - as when I opened my first Westy years ago or just a couple months ago having the FW vertical. 
All that doesn't matter - what matters is the beer. Once I butchered the hell out of the wax cap and caused an absolute scene - the incredibly thick and heavy liquid was poured into our respective glasses. A great looking beer for sure: just scary dark, with a really pretty head about a centimeter or so thick with a plum/purplish head. Lacing, check. Lots of lacking and a even as we all sat there for an uncomfortable amount of time not knowing what to do - the smell was mushroom tattooing me on the forehead.
Sweet Sweet chocolate with an incredible amount of - well, booze. A wide array of things happening in this one: vanilla, dark sugar plums, brown sugar, tobacco, raisins, licorice, and of course malts. But then, as we are sitting around listening to bleach something happens - the complexity becomes dwarfed by a smell of booze, and not even good booze... almost rubbing alcohol. It becomes a bit off putting and I am not sure how to fairly rate a beer that begins with me saying "this is f'n great" to ehh... "what the hell happened here". I don't want to discount how good it smells, just that it needs time I suppose. 
The taste followed the same trend. It began with a very nice and complex flavor, like a cup really good hot chocolate, you get some of the oak, lots of the vanilla and coffee flavors come through. But then it is almost as if the person who made your hot coffee decided to add more mix, to much mix - creating an uber-sweet concoction that became incredibly hard to drink.
The mouth feel was heavy, lush and sticky. The more it warmed up, the stickiness turned from a nice coat over around the tongue to what felt like a bit of Emerson's glue being swirled around. 
And I understand the this has to be rated to style, but part of what makes an Imperial Stout so great is when it is drinkable. 2/3rds of us couldn't finish our glass. It was to sweet, to sticky, and to boozy. It was a really different experience... going from what started as an amazing experience to 20 minutes later being on the complete other end of the spectrum. Good beer for sure, by no means my favorite from the Bruery or from the style. Glad I was able to try it 2,783 characterscalise1122, Dec 04, 2009

The bottle pours a richly deep black liquid with a small brownish head. The edges look almost purple.
Aroma starts out nice...rich chocolate, dark fruits, molasses and vanilla. But as this beer warms it starts to head a bit down hill. Overly sweet chocolate and a ton of booze...almost rubbing alcohol like.
Taste is similar to the aroma...lots of rich chocolate, dark fruit, some oak and vanilla. But again as it warms it becomes way too boozy and way to sweet, like drinking chocolate syrup right from the bottle. The booze is also very overpowering at this point.
Mouthfeel is super sticky, overly sweet and very viscous.
I have to say drink ability is not great, but its not horrible. All the sweetness and booze that appears as this warms really kills the drink ability. I find it really hard to believe a lot of these ratings that are giving drink ability such a high score, these people mush be missing a palate and taste buds...Patrick is a great brewer and i applaud the effort, but its a little much... 1,071 charactersgregc, Dec 04, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5So, we drove eight hours to Orange County for this bad boy. Big Ups to my main man eliottJW for getting an early allotment and sharing this experience with me.
Poured from a Bruery Champagne bottle into a Russian River Tulip.
The color on this is surprising. While black, there are still hints of light around the edges making a sort of deep brown appearance. A solid pour yielded a one finger width of quickly receding vibrant brown foam. Everything about the pour put any unease about a lack of carbonation at rest. As I drank the glass down there was no lacing left behind.
The nose on this beer frankly frightens me. It's that figgy pudding, ten loaves of bread in a bottle malt punch that I will forever associate with Goose Island's BCS, a beer I do not enjoy. There's the lovely bourbon hit too but it is swallowed by malts. In a nod to the subjectivity of reviews I will note that the smell is full and colorful with a blunt shape. I get a little of the bourbon and maaayyybeee some licorice but ultimately it's a blast of bread.
The mouthfeel is luscious. Velvety liquid coats my palate but doesn't get jammy in the process. The only note here would be related to the carb bite. I would have actually enjoyed an even more viscous brew especially as the bubbles kept reminding me of just how alcoholic this beer is. That said I'd rather take the bite than have a totally flat beer.
The taste on this beast is stupid, and should be illegal. After the abuse of the nose I was expecting the hottest alcohol hit ever, but was met instead by a sumptuous maiden of flavor. There are the dark fruits I crave in a RIS, some prune and maybe a hit of raisin like sweetness. There's also that wonderful Abyss like hint of candied sugars. But the thing that sets BT apart is the incredibly smooth and balanced flavor of bourbon that pervades the quaff. I have to force my tongue upward to taste any bittering on its sides and it is there like I expected, keeping a lid on an extremely sweet beer.
If this astronomically high ABV is correct I can't believe how drinkable this brew is. Clearly meant to be sipped and enjoyed like a distilled beverage, I have never wanted to drink so much of such a potentially dangerous beverage. Hats of to the Bruery. I count myself extremely lucky to try this rare treat. 2,308 characterscptierney, Dec 01, 2009

3.8/5  rDev -15%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5750ml bottle poured into snifters.
A = On a fairly vigorous pour I get a small quarter inch chocolate brown head that settles relatively quickly into sparse bubbles around the edge of the glass and atop perhaps 25% of the surface.
S = Huge smells of bourbon, maple, melted dark chocolate, vanilla, underneath are some black cherries. There is quite a bit of alcohol burn in there, too, though which I guess I should have expected but so many others have talked about how hidden it is.
T = Rich dark chocolate melted and poured into a cup with fresh heavy cream. Some nuttiness with sharp notes like walnuts have. Oak and vanilla flavors show up at midpalate. At the end and in the aftertaste though I get a kind of thin metallic taste, I think it is the alcohol, but I'm not positive. 
M = Very full bodied, luxurious as it swishes around the mouth, extremely good mouthcoating. I could do with slightly less carbonation as it kind of burns when paired with the alcohol, but overall one of the best mouthfeels I've had in a beer.
D = This is a sipper for sure. Indeed, I poured close to 8 ounces in my snifter and wish I would have poured half of that. While quite good, it is a bit overpowering and really does not necessarily draw me to each sip as I could wish it did. Definitely one I'd like to be able to have on other occasions, but I'm not sure if I were going to pick one dessert beer of fortified wine strength to have on hand that it would be this one. Good but just not that extra bit I could wish for.
At the end of the day, it is a very enjoyable beer, but it leaves a somewhat tinny, bitter metallic aftertaste that lingers long after the sweet luscious flavors that make this such a great beer. I would imagine this will be great after two or three years in the bottle, but I am not sure it is actually quite ready for drinking yet. 1,853 charactersTraquairlover, Nov 28, 2009

A month later, with the combination of the occurrence of Thanksgiving, I finally decided to crack open this much-talked-about monster. 
Pour into a tulip class, the color was as opaque with a healthy dose of head, even with its high. Smell of powerful bourbon and coffee as soon as the cap dropped. 
There wasn't any alcohol burn in my stomach as the I swallowed my first sip. It was a bit sweeter than I've considered ideal, nevertheless it was extremely drinkable given that this brew is near 20% abv. 
Easy to go down, but rather hard for me to finish the whole bottle in a timely manner. I opened it on the wee hour of Thanksgiving and continued to sip away the next morning. 808 charactersvince4953529, Nov 27, 2009

Poured into a Bruery tulip, pours a wonderful jet black with a ring of brown foam around the outside, upon swirling a bit of foam builds up and quickly dies down. I stick my nose down into the glass with bright notes of vanilla and oak are the first things I smell, next comes this awesome roastiness and smells of chocolate, expresso, molasses and dark sweet fruits like raisins. It smells so good! I could smell this beer for days! The dark chocolate smell in this beer is predominate, and in the finish a little bit of an alcohol bite. I dive in for my first taste and wow, just wow! This beer is so good! It was served a little cold but, as it warmed up, it got better and better. The taste is similar to the smell, oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, expresso roastiness, molasses and dark fruits. This beer is over the top! just big in every-way! It is complex and the flavors are just layered over each other. It is a bit on the sweeter side but it is not cloying. It finishes super smooth and is just amazing. The beer is lightly carbonated and very full bodied, this beer has some real substance to it. It is hard to give this beer a 5 on drinkability, even though I would kill to be able to drink this beer all the time, it is 19.5% and it is just so over the top and bold. Overall, this beer is just amazing and I am addicted, I went every chance I got to try this beer. I can't wait to crack open one of my bottles! 1,552 characterswalows, Nov 26, 2009
3.38/5  rDev -24.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2Thanks to Greg for the sample at johns. Much appreciated! Pours pitch black with a small tan head. Aroma is up front raisin, vanilla, figs, plums, and brown sugar. Lots of dark fruit along with chocolate are sitting in the background, and the alcohol is really prominent after a good amount of sniffing and swirling. The flavor, unfortunately, is a bit of a mess.
Up front this beer has a great bourbon/vanilla flavor, and quite a bit of chocolatey goodness. Molasses and toffee round out the good parts. Very rich. It all falls apart when the cloying sweetness hits you. All of the great notes of the beer get dominated by the under-attenuation, think amaretto sweetness and you are getting close. After a few sips I'm just overwhelmed. Not enough is going on to offset the cloying aspects of this beer; it doesn't try to hide it one bit. It also had a bit of over roasted coffee thrown in that I didn't pick up at all in the nose. I had a rough time getting through my pour and I think if I would have finished it my score would be lower. If ever a beer demanded to be drank in 4oz portions for maximum enjoyment, I'd say this is the one.
The finish is very viscous, almost exactly what you would expect it to be. Carbonation is very soft and works really well. It does have a decent bit of peppery alcohol bite, think tequilla. Being a big spirit drinker I'd certainly question the 19.5% claim on this one though, I'd peg it more in the 15-16% range. If they hit ~20, I'd be impressed with the lack of alcohol presence.
Overall this is a very nice imperial stout and I look forward to trying it again. I could see myself drinking this one in place of a nice port after a meal or when I have a craving for sweets. 1,718 characterspepsican, Nov 25, 2009
4.51/5  rDev +0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Thirstybird for sharing and stevemcqueenjr for carrying it cross-country. Pours an inky black with no light penetration. A quarter inch mocha-colored head quickly dissipates into a swirl of foam and a tight band that coalesced around the perimeter of the glass. Incredible nose - sweet, vanilla, bourbon, malty, brown sugar and a little booze. Taste follows nose - this is an incredibly sweet and decadent beer I have to say. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied; not overly carbonated, but just a tad too much, such that it cuts the viscosity. This is definitely a beer to sip and savor; however, the abv is well-hidden, all things considering. A truly incredible experience - believe the hype. 700 charactersJwale73, Nov 25, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Have been lucky enough to have had this beer both on tap at The Bruery and from a fresh bottle the week it was released. 
Pours pitch black with a thin layer of tan, almost brown head. 
Great smells as soon as the glass gets within 3 feet of your nose, bourbon is very strong and mixes well with the chocolate, vanilla and molasses. 
The thick nectar seems to want to grab hold of the side of the glass and not let go, when it does it almost appears to have stained the glass brown. 
The taste is a full mix of bourbon, espresso coffee, molasses, dark fruit, vanilla, oak and roasted malts. While strong the bourbon does not overpower and works with the other flavors instead of competing or trying to cover them up. Alcohol, while evident, is not as strong as you would expect in a beer that is supposed to be 19.5%. A little on the sweet side and thus the reason for the lower taste and drinkability scores, more than 5 or 6 ounces of this would start to be too much for me. 
Definitely will drink this beer again and look forward to taking one of my remaining bottles back to the East Coast to share with a couple of friends and family. 1,144 charactersrmseven4, Nov 25, 2009
3.18/5  rDev -28.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.5Many, many thanks to HopHeadlouie for sending this to me... I'm saddened that it was not what I had hoped for.
A viscous black, liquified dark, nothing on top at all. Stains, not legs or lacing, remain on the sides, a glass of ink, black ink, careful it doesn't stain your clothes.
One whiff and you remember your childhood. You used to love sweets. Eat them all day. Pecan pie, Hershey's chocolate syrup, fudge, chocolate cake. These are what you smell, the aromas that you used to love. But now you are older. Now you also smell the alcoholic burn in it... you catch the hint, the hint of that soy-sauce-sweet-syrup, that called Triple Bock. No, really. Yes, really. A good dose of Triple Bock with the chocolate cake in the nose.
And the flavour, there again, reminds you... well, no sense in remembering, let's break out the ol' photo album, and there you are. Chocolate cake all over your face, your hair, your hands, chocolate icing, chocolate milk, chocolate fudge, chocolate brownies, and caramel. Milky Way, take a bite of alcoholic Milky Way. Alcoholic sweet, chocolatey, syrupy, nougatey, fudgey, Triple Bock.
That Hershey's syrup mouthfeel too, syrupy, sticky, creamy, immensely thick, almost no carbonation, and a lingering syrupy warmth.
This thing would be wonderful if you still loved to eat chocolate cake until your gut could no longer take it anymore. It's little but a chocolate fudge liqueur. Nothing RIS about this one. No roastiness, no balance, just tons and tons of chocolate syrup. Alcoholic, liquid chocolate cake. 1,542 characterskhiasmus, Nov 24, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Black Tuesday. It exposes English for the failure of a language it is. No words capable of the profound expression needed.
The ancient Chinese have a symbol. Unpronounceable, but which I have always referred to as The Xa. The Xa is the very concept of inexpressibility. The Xa transcends language and evokes emotion, raw and true.
Black Tuesday is The Xa. A beer which has profoundly impacted my life. With but a single sip, all prior culinary experiences became dull and meaningless by comparison.
Appearance: Black. Impenetrable darkness. A thin brown head, the only sign of life beneath the murky depths.
Smell: Chocolate. Bourbon. Molasses. A delicate richness never before known to beer. Every inhalation is an orgasm of the senses.
Taste: Roasted malts, bourbon. Barrel aged complexity that is beyond the previous limits of my experience.
Mouthfeel: Thick and viscous. Brutal and abusive in many ways, but with the delicate touch of a passionate lover.
Drinkability: Unparalleled. One could drink this forever into the oblivion.
True joy escaped my face in the form of a single tear, rolling down the cheek, into the sublime concoction I was partaking of.
I was one with The Xa.
The pleasure, immeasurable, the pain unthinkable.
White Truffle. Black Caviar. Foie Gras. Even the forbidden Ortolan. They now meant less than nothing to me. They tasted foul and vile by comparison.
Food, I cannot eat. Drink, I cannot drink.
Every day, every minute, since my sip of Black Tuesday, I have been haunted by The Xa.
Help me, Patrick Rue.
Help. Me. 1,560 charactersSandstone, Nov 23, 2009

Scent of sweet dark fruit, maple syrup, chocolate, a hint of oak, some alcohol, and bourbon. Very sweet, and though the alcohol is noticeable, it is hardly overpowering.
Taste of strong chocolate, sweet maple syrup, bourbon, molasses, candi sugar, oak, and a hint of alcohol. Finishes with dry oak, vanilla and some alcohol. Incredible stuff, not at all suggestive of it's 19.5% ABV.
Mouthfeel is heavy bodied and oily with a small bite of carbonation. As expected, the mouthfeel is perfectly smooth and heavy, but not quite flat. 625 characterspaco1029384756, Nov 22, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Very massive thank you to Richard for this bottle to be shared at our tasting. 
A - Poured pitch black, no light shines through even when held up to the light. Creamy, tan head that retained as a thin cap and shortly dissipated. No lacing, but very nice considering it is 19.5%. (4.0)
S - Lots of bourbon. It dominated the aroma, although not too unbalanced. Light hints of blackberries and dark chocolate. Very malt forward. There seems to be many layers of complexity here that could have shown more colors. A touch is shown here and there. Bourbon is still quite prominent. But amazing. Like a well aged Bourbon County Stout. (4.0)
T - Wow, where to start? First off, there is a lovely rich fruitiness of an aged RIS. A touch of fig, but more so in the black currant department, molasses, and heavy roasted malts. Lots of chocolate and expresso bean. Bourbon is a huge part of the flavor but does not dominate like it does in the aroma. Fantastic balance for a huge beer, you can hardly taste any hotness from the alcohol. Finishes roasty and sweet, with much bourbon flavor. (4.5)
M - As huge of a beer it is, it is not cloyingly sweet nor is it sticky. Chewy, yes, I can nearly spread it on toast, but damn this drinks incredibly smooth. Not hot at all, just a hint of warmth after it trickles down your throat. Carbonation is very mild. It works for the huge character, just enough to bring everything together. (5.0)
D - A lovely sipper. A full bottle is a bit much at nearly 20% but split between three or four people, it can be enjoyed for hours in an evening. (4.5)
Notes - I treated this beer as any other beer to review. Honestly, I don't give a crap about how hyped up a beer is. A beer is a beer and if your tastebuds enjoy it, then great. If not, at least you gained experience. Personally, I thought this was an excellent beer, although I would have preferred slightly less bourbon in the nose. That was really the only thing that I could complain about. In terms of taste, I can definitely appreciate the subtleties of a year's worth of bourbon barrel aging. It is very much like a vintage Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. In fact, I think I enjoy the balance in GIBCS a touch more than BT. However, its velvety smoothness and lack of alcoholic hotness is what gave it its exceptional texture. Overall, I felt that this was an awesome experience. Thanks again, Richard. 2,394 charactersDmanGTR, Nov 22, 2009
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4*This review was a fresh bottle of '09. 
Big thanks go out to Mauerhan, one of the most generous and fair traders on this site, for hooking me up with this bottle. Had this last night, shared with friends, took a few notes.
Strange thing happened. As I cut into the wax around the cap, I heard a fizzing sound before I even popped the cap off. That's odd. Poured a dark brown color when viewed in the light, but was completely black in the glass, no head or lacing. Not sure why/how the appearance on this one has been garnering so many 5's, but I digress.
This beer smelled exceptional. Those who know me well know I love bourbon, and this is the best smelling bourbon barrel aged beer I've ever come across. So much wood and bourbon, followed by dark chocolate, graininess, figs, light vanilla, and port. Yep.. This smells amazing. The aroma was easily my favorite part of this beer. 
Upon first sip, when it was still a little cold, it tasted much like port, with plenty of chocolate and bourbon. It's a very sweet, complex combination of figs, brown sugar, caramel, and chocolate. As it warms up, the bourbon really starts to come out, especially after a few swirls of the glass, along with some cocoa powder-like chocolate. To me, it literally tasted like a liquid bourbon ball. Outstanding!
The mouthfeel was really great on this beer, really thick, viscous, light carbonation. The only complaint here is that it nearly became cloyingly sweet, and left a little too much of a sugary coating in my mouth and on my lips.
Drinkability really is lower for me on this one. For 19%, the alcohol is well hidden on the tongue, but it does have a good warming as it goes down, and the sweetness/richness is a little much after awhile. The 8-9oz pour I had was just enough, I think. I couldn't see drinking much more than 10oz of this at a time. 
Great brew. Glad I got to try this one. No further comments. 
Thanks again, Topher! 1,934 charactersKeefD, Nov 22, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My second review of the great Black Tuesday. This time out of a bottle. largadeer was kind enough to share this awesome rarity - thanks a lot, Chris!
A - Well, it's black. I was really expecting more of a light golden-straw color. Huge disappointment when I realized this was a -bal aged imperial stout rather than an American adjunct lager. Can't win 'em all I guess.
S - Aroma did not wow me as much as before. In fact, this is the one area that this beer fell short. To be frank (as in candid, not hot dog), Cigar City Hunahpus, Marshal Zhukov, and -bal aged 110k+OT, which I had before this, smelled considerably better. I mean it has nice chocolate, roast, bourbon, and vanilla, but I also got a bit of soy sauce that was a little reminiscent of Sam Adams Triple Bock. Don't get me wrong, it smelled better than average, but there are a lot better imperial stouts in this category out there.
T - Well, once again, it's amazing, and I've got to give it a 5 here. Rich chocolate, molasses, roasted malt, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, a little dark fruit - it's all in there. Lasts a long time and does not disappoint in the least. Not much booze at all, but the 19.5% does hit you later. Had about an ounce of a Black Tuesday/Utopias blend also and it was incredible.
M - Thick and viscous with medium-low carbonation, just the right level for this beer. Not syrupy or cloying like you'd think it might be. Booze is there, and you can sense that this is very strong, but not nearly as strong as you'd expect for the ABV.
D - Finished my glass incredibly quickly. Way, way too easy to drink. This was at the end of a large tasting, and the BT sent me over the edge. Still have a headache from it as I write this. 1,716 charactersnickd717, Nov 21, 2009
3.43/5  rDev -23.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Big thanks to khiasmus for the opportunity to try this one. With it being held for such high ransom on the trading forum, I was worried I might not have a shot at this one.
Inpenetrable black pour. There's more light brown foam than I would have imagined, which retains well. Not a whole lot of lacing left on the glass, which doesn't surprise me.
The aroma is really, really sweet. Like your standard stout, with a couple of shots of bourbon and a packet of Nestle Quik dumped in. Or maybe if you poured Hershey's syrup into some spiked black coffee. Either way, you get the picture. It's an amped up imperial stout.
The flavor is...well, big. Lots of dark chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and bourbon. Again, it's what you expect from a monster barrel-aged imperial stout. 
Unfortunately, there is a harsh boozy finish. I read so many reviews prior to drinking this beer that said how it tasted nothing like 19.5% and how well the alcohol was masked...this beer was hotter than the Dogfish Head Fort we had earlier.
Big, big body. Sticky texture. Obviously, not a very easy drinker. Definitely glad to try it, but it's not worth $30 to me, and it's certainly not worth trading away way more than it's worth. 1,211 charactersGyle41386, Nov 21, 2009
2.95/5  rDev -34%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2.5Bottle shared by Fiver29. Thanks John.
Pours pitch black with a decent brown head. Has the look of Motor oil, or a very thick milkshake. Aroma of sherry, chocolate, coffee and some booze. I don't get any barrel. Flavor is pretty much the same - chocolate, sherry and coffee - but it has an odd, twangy sour finish that wasn't appealing. The best thing about the beer was the body, nice and thick. Not very drinkable, but ok in small doses. 
This is a very average beer, nothing special. 488 charactersmiketd, Nov 21, 2009
3.83/5  rDev -14.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Bottle pours pitch black with tan head. Aroma is amazing. I detect subtle notes of bourbon, slight oxidation, dark roast, coffee, chocoate, and dark grain. This has a really pronounced dark grain aroma that just dominates. If you have ever brewed with dark grains that is what it smells like. Those black grains just stand out the most for me in the nose. Dense and viscous mouthfeel. Flavor has a touch of alcohol, bourbon, coffee, grains, and finishes somewhat chocolate sweet with a slight grain astringency. The sweet chocolate and grain astringency finish knock this beer down a bit for me. I don't care for the sweetness or astringency. And that is what I'm left with as it finishes. It has all the layers of complexity that make it a remarkable if not one of the best beers on the planet. I just wish it finished better. Still a nice beer to try either way. 864 charactersfiver29, Nov 21, 2009
4.02/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks KeefD for sharing!
This beer looked almost just like any other imperial stout. In fact after having this beer last night I had a pout of the Darkness 09' and thought that had more head retention and lacing. Very dark and syrupy look to it. 
A small swirl and then smell brought out a ton of the bourbon, a little overpowering to me. I could get more essence of the different flavors smelling than tasting it seemed.
This beer hides the almost 20% alcohol it holds pretty well. Small chocolate and vanilla flavors to it. As it warmed up the flavors were more brought out and so was the bourbon.
It deffinitly made my lips sticky, and almost felt like I had some coating my mouth. Pretty smooth, but Im saying that for a 20% beer.
I couldn't imagine drinking an entire bottle of this to myself and splitting it 3 ways I was close to buzzing! A sharing bottle indeed. Drinkability is just above what I would consider average. 934 charactersSparklePants, Nov 21, 2009
3.9/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3Again thanks to Miketd and Fiver29 for hooking this up for a small Friday tasting.
A: Deep cola black hole looking color with a small but sufficient head. Decent legs but not much lacing.
S: Interesting. I imagine taking some cocoa nibs and soaking them in soy sauce. After that you would take that old bourbon barrel you have out back that your Uncle Cornelius picked up for you that you thought would be good to throw some of your Aunt Mae's famous maple syrup in. Now throw those nibs in that barrel and add some grain to the mix with a little malt. Shake vigorously chill and serve. You would have just recreated Black Tuesday.
T: Read my thoughts on the smell of this beer and translate that to your taste buds. Pretty straightforward.
M: Definitely the highlight of this brew. Viscous. I should probably just keep a spare bottle in my car in case I start leaking oil. Good carbonation.
D: 25.4 oz = 24 hours. Definitely something to share. I have to say this is a very unique and interesting beer. I don't feel it is worth all the hype, some maybe but not all of it. Very good don't get me wrong but you Cali guys can just keep holding on to those bottles for yourselves. 1,182 charactersdrgonzo3705, Nov 21, 2009
4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A-Opens with a nice hiss and pours a black so dark the lord of the pit himself couldn't see his way out. Head builds nicely but reduces to a fine dark brown skin. This dames got legs for days a quick swirl around the snifter coats the sides very well.
S-Burbon, vanilla, black strap molasses, a bit of boozyness that seems to come more from the bourbon then the brew itself but what do I know. As it warms the aromas really open up and brings out dark fruits and brown sugar. Wow factor on the smell for sure.
T-Big time bourbon and dark roasty malts. Vanilla bean and fudge, coco power and that blackstrap again. The barrel aging really shows but it does not over shadow this amazing brew.
m- Thick and viscous, smooth and creamy. It coats the mouth and then the perfect amount carb fizzes up and carries the liquid to a new level of complexity. I love a thick beer and this one is up there but not too much that one cant appreciated it.
D-Well I wish I had twice as much. Yes, it is a huge beer with lots of abv but it is by no means overly hot. As it warms a bit more of the heat comes out so Im thinking with some time this will be a perfect 5 in my book. Amazing beer from an amazing brewery, keep up the good work. 1,224 charactersoglmcdgl, Nov 21, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Well, I first heard about Black Tuesday back in early summer. Naurally, being a lover of great stout like myself, I have been dying to try this one. Endless thanks to davod23, the best trading partner in the world. Bottle shared with dear friend and fellow BA Hopfu on a rainy Tuesday afternoon alongside 09 Goose Island BCS and 09 KBS for comparison in the ever-faithful Duvel glass at cellar temperature. So onto the 19.5%, 20 malt, 15 month bourbon barrel-aged beast! 
Wow, stunning packaging from choice of inks, paper and wax on this bottle. Admirable attention to detail in every respect. A gentle pour into the glass renders a one inch dark khaki head that soon recedes to the liquid surface. Rich, viscuous retention on the glass suggests some serious liquid extract. The body is black and dense as any world-class Imperial Stout. The aromatics are fantastic! One of the most lush dessert scents like Vahlrona lava cake and pure vanilla extract. No trace of booziness anywhere. My senses are fully engaged in anticipation at this point. Anchors aweigh, my boys! The attack is phenomenal. All sorts of extravagant analogies such as young vintage port, chocolate cream liquer, and black barleywine coming to mind. Neither the bourbon nor barrel component is overdone. The sweetness however is a slight challenge for me...moreso than I expected, but at these extremes is very well-managed. The finish becomes slightly one-dimensional due to the sweetness, but does reveal traces of alcohol. Ultimately delicious in every way, I truly believe that another year in the barrel would have made this even more integrated. It certainly deserves its place in the pantheon of all-time greatest stouts. While in the bar of my dreams, this would certainly be on tap, but I can't say that it is my all-time favorite. I will be checking in regularly to see how it ages though. So does it set a new benchmark for it's category? Absolutely. I, however, believe that The Bruery has the potential to produce even better beers than this one. It just reminds me how grateful I am to be alive during this unprecedented golden age of craft beer. 2,130 charactersSteamhead, Nov 20, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A bottle of this fortuitously made its way to the Rochester BA Tasting this past Saturday at the Tap and Mallet. My heartfelt thanks go out to Richard and Daren for making this possible. While I don't usually review beers I've had at tastings, I had a decent 3-4 oz. serving of this. While that may be too small an amount to review most beers, due to the nature of this amazing brew I don't think I would drink more than about 8 oz. of it at a time anyway (though I would definitely want to). Therefore, I feel justified in posting the notes and ratings that I took down at the tasting. 
A: Pours pitch black with a beautiful tan head. Just a little lacing, but I can also see lots of legs sliding down the sides of the glass. 
S: Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, some oak, and warm, stinging alcohol. Definitely not your typical aroma, but still quite amazing. 
T: Similar to the nose, but even better! Bourbon is very apparent, but is complemented quite well by flavors of vanilla, molasses, caramel, and chocolate. Some toasty malts are also apparent. Heat from the alcohol is pretty apparent, but it works well with everything that is going on. 
M: Amazingly smooth, very little carbonation. Warms just like brandy or bourbon going down. 
D: The epitome of a sipper. As I noted above, I wouldn't want to drink a lot of this in one sitting, but a good 8-12 oz serving would probably last you well over an hour if treated right. The flavors and aroma are so complex and amazing - I wish I had a few bottles of this to sip on during the cold winter months. I was ready for a let down after all the hype, but after trying this I think most of the hype is definitely deserved. I'm not sure it deserves to be on the ridiculously high pedestal most traders put it on, but it is most certainly one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. 1,851 charactersMrDanno96, Nov 19, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 520 malt batch consumed on 08/01/2009 on tap at The Bruery. I toyed with the idea of driving up here to try this on draft, and the only thing that was stopping me was the fact that I already had a couple bottles reserved. With each new review of the beer that I read, the urge to head north grew stronger, and finally I found myself on the 5 North last Saturday riding for victory (more bottles and a draft sample).
The liquid is black in my snifter, as any good Imperial Stout should be. The toffee head is mountainous, and it leaves behind thick legs on the sides which are quickly reanimated by a swirl of the glass. The retention is excellent, finally choosing to settle into a lingering froth of various shades of brown. Great looking beer.
The aroma is magnificent. The dark fruit component is made up of grapes, dark cherries, and plums. Blackstrap molasses is present. The 19% is not at all represented in the nose. You could tell me the ABV of this beer is 7% and I'd believe you (If I hadn't already seen the legs). Notes of brown sugar accompany vanilla, oak, and rich toffee sweetness. Dark chocolate is noticeable, and the bourbon is very well integrated into the aroma. It doesn't overpower and it doesn't take center stage. The candied sugar is excellent, but it's the maple that really stands out for me.
The flavor is rich chocolate and toffee with bourbon and oak. The sweetness is sugary but nowhere near cloying. It's made up of maple, which tastes wonderful, and candied, which is also fantastic. I commented on the well integrated bourbon in the aroma, and that trend continues in the flavor. I really love bourbon dominated beers, but there's so much going in Black Tuesday that balance is key, and any overshadowing flavor would be to its detriment. The dark fruit complexity is made up of plums, dark cherries, and grapes. Blackstrap molasses is present, and once again the alcohol hints at an ABV much lower than 19.5%. I honestly can't believe it. The only evidence of such an ABV is in the warming finish and the body that is evident in the legs in the appearance. The alcohol is masterfully hidden. The finish exhibits alcohol warming, with lingering toffee, bourbon, and maple sugar.
The beer is full bodied with a nice medium level of draft carbonation. I really hope this carbonation level carries through to the bottles. The mouthfeel is creamy, silky, chewy, and at times it is sticky.
All aboard. This is one of the best Imperial Stouts around and you'll just have to deal with it. Black Tuesday is a paragon. 2,548 charactersHopHead84, Nov 19, 2009

Midnight sky black with some dark muddy spots towards the edges. The beer pours thick and oil like and just looks like some gooey syrup. You may want to put some plastic down on your couch before enjoying this near 20%er, things could get tricky. Not really any head, save for a few small patches of brown bubbles. Nothing in terms of lace but there is a brown dirty film that remains on the glass.
Smells like sweet heaven. Black Tuesday has a bold nose, and it reaches far from the glass. An equal amount of roasted malt and chocolate attack the senses, opening my eyes. A nice vanilla base and minimal coffee. The bourbon is huge and makes me smile. BT smells like a souped up Bourbon County Stout mixed with a small bit of World Wide Stout, but with even more malt sweetness. Some molasses and licorice. The alcohol is masked very well but it's not 100% out of the way.
Tuesday is big, It's huge in fact. The two main tastes is dark rich chocolate and roasted malts working in unison together. Under that is more malt giving off more sweetness plus caramel. Expensive bourbon makes a move next and leaves my mouth a bit hot and boozy, but im loving it. The bourbon shines with temp. changes. Some oak from the barrel. Surprised not to get a lot of coffee out of BT, it's very minimal. For a beer this size I was expecting some soy sauce, and i got some but just a touch, phew. Molasses and more malt in the finish, this stuff is big. 
The alcohol is masked well but I can still tell it's there easily with a slight hotness, it's small and not in the way. BT is thick and viscous, chewy and RAW. Kind of goes down like a light syrup while taking small sips. This has a certain slickness going down leaving all the ingredients on the tounge, and then finishing with some hot booze. The bourbon seems to be sticking around the longest. 
Slowly and surely I will make it through this darkness. BT demands some time and patience and a plate of assorted chocolates to heighten the experience. Spread the love and share with a friend or two or you may not make it into work the next morning. For the amount of alcohol and sweetness this beer is very approachable. I believe that while aging this may do something to the taste and heat, it wont exactly benefit greatly as it's huge and great right now
Black Tuesday actually reminded me of some of those big foreign stouts including some Mikeller stuff, Dark Horizon and the like, only with the American twist of doing it even bigger. 2,601 charactersBARFLYB, Nov 16, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 1.5Cracked open a bottle of this last night with some friends. Pours viscous black with mocha head. Smells amazing - we all kept sniffing this over and over before even taking a sip. Sweet bourbon, brown sugar, and vanilla are all quite prominent. Tastes quite bourbony and sweet, with more brown sugar and vanilla. Maybe a hint of butterscotch in there too. After sampling this at GABF, I wasn't sure if I'd find it to be too sweet for my taste. Thankfully that was not the case. This tastes to me like Goose Island BCS squared. Body is very thick, and well supported by ample carbonation. Overall, an extremely delicious brew. My biggest complaint is that this is sold in 750 ml bottles. Absurd, given the high ABV. If I want to share with friends, I can just open a second smaller bottle. No need for the large format. 818 characterswaltonc, Nov 15, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well, had a chance to sample one of my precious few remaining bottles of this. It's made its way from tap to bottle spectacularly. I really don't have too much to change about my review (I invariably only review a beer once, regardless of how many serving variations I have, but I'll make an exception this one time). I'll put in all caps the differences.
Pours a dark black, with a surprisingly robust bubbling brown head. IF ANYTHING, IT MIGHT BE MORE CARBONATED IN THE BOTTLED VERSION, AS I REMEMBER THE HEAD DYING DOWN FASTER FOR THE ON-TAP VERSION. YAY FORCED CARBONATION.
Smells like molasses, brown sugar, heavenly bourbon (these guys have the f****g best bourbon barrels), vanilla, and a bit of spicy ... nuttiness? Caramel? Insane. Tons of roasted chocolate and malt. 
Taste delivers on the promise of the smell. Just wondrous. More bourbon, more roasted bitter chocolate malt with an undercurrent of sweet milk chocolate, a crazy pecan/woody/earthy nutty aftertaste, that "vanilla in the raw" flavor, and layered brown sugar/molasses. Hints of oak/wood. This is absolutely great. IT'S BEEN IN THE BARREL A BIT LONGER, AND MAY BE A BIT STRONGER IN THE BOURBON AND VANILLA.
 For what it is, the drinkability is dangerous and insane. Sticky, chewy, and thick. Rivals Dark Lord, Darkness, PtY, and World Wide Stout for thickest, chewiest beer I've ever tried.
One of a handful of beers I could legitimately call the best I've ever had. I will treasure this "twenty malt" version. 1,490 charactersOverlord, Nov 15, 2009
4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle courtesy of RoyMunson.
Pours a very dark brown, damn near black in color. A nice mocha colored head on the pour. Looks very inviting. 
Smell is dark molasses, some tobacco, and a little bit of alcohol in the nose. Smell is good.
Taste is incredibly smooth and creamy. Did I say creamy, this beer is absolutely ridonculous. 
Plenty of roasted molasses, with a very nice dark chocolate flavor, milk shake material.
Plenty of hotness and alcohol coming through in the flavor. This is a good beer, but I doubt it's worth what people are giving up. I would take Vanilla Bean Dark Lord over this beer easily. 610 charactersFtownThrowDown, Nov 15, 2009
4.94/5  rDev +10.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to Roymunson for sharing this during Munsonfest.
A: Pitch black, very thick but not quite motor oil or Dark Lord. Moderate head on the pour with just a bit of retention. Some wispy lacing.
S: Deep, rich fucking malts. Not burnt but very roasty with loads of deep sugary molasses. You can definitely tell that it's a huge beer bu the alcohol only comes out a bit and is already melding well.
T/M: I want to hate this beer but I can't. This is very good. Deep, rich malts, but again, not burnt. Deeply sweet molasses and caramel. Some muted hops but not huge like Expo. Damn fine alcohol line, not much heat but plenty of flavor that melds nicely. Light, flavorful wood with some vanilla but not tons of bourbon. Body is full but not heavy and very very creamy.
D: 19.5? I would never guess this past 12 or so but still incredibly drinkable. Like I said.... I want to hate this beer because of the hype but damn.... This is an incredible beer.
EDIT: Just split a bottle with my Kels and the bourbon is much more pronounced in this bottle. Still not massive on the bourbon but definitely a step up and a nice improvement. Gonna bump the aroma up to a 5. Fantastic. 1,178 characterspwoods, Nov 15, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- Poured about ten ounces into a Bruery tulip glass. Black Tuesday appears motor oil-black with a brief showing of light-brown foam that dissipates to a thin, swirly film over the beer and a thick ring along the inside of the glass. No lacing at all.
S- Bourbon whiskey, oak wood, and vanilla backed by hugely sweet notes of dark chocolate, molasses, anise, and dark fruits caramelized in brown sugar. There's little indication that this beer is almost 20% alcohol.
T- The initial taste is of suagry dark fruits -- maybe choclate covered raisins and dates -- and loads of syrupy sweetness. Bourbon whiskey and oak barrel accent every flavor from start to finish. The 19.5% ABV is remarkeably well-hidden and the finish leaves deeply sweet flavors of chocolate syrup along with a mild espresso bitterness clinging to the palate and the sides of the mouth. There's just a touch of alcohol heat in the chest after each sip. The final taste is of woody bourbon barrel and molasses. 
M- A rich, creamy mouthfeel with fine, delicate carbonation bubbles that provide just the right amount of balancing effervescnece to the viscous and slightly syrupy texture.
D- This is incredibly drinkable stuff given the immense ABV and the massively sweet flavors. I was able to finish my entire glass and was left wanting more.
One of the best beers I've ever had. I'll be interested to see what a few years of age will do, if anything. 1,424 charactersTdizzle, Nov 14, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Thanks to T Dizzle for opening this with me. I had this a few times on tap but this is my first from the bottle.
A: Blacker than black can be. Very little head. Poured with a 1/4 inch dark tan head but disappeared quickly. and no lacing what so ever.
S: Smells A LOT like Goose Island Bourbon County Stout! but sweeter. You definitely get a lot of the sugars in the aroma. The alcohol is hidden very very well.
T: Bourbon hits first and then fades into a boozey, sugary, flavor-fest. Quite nice. The sweetness lingers a little too long for my taste. Again very reminicent of Goose Island BCS.
M: Feels great. Perfect amount of carbonation. Great body. Not too dry as I would expect from this high of ABV. Coats the mouth, leaving great flavor.
D: I think I could finish about 1/2 of a bottle but that would be about it. Not just cuz of the 19.5 ABV. But the sugars seem to get a little too sweet. Almost like a Liqueur. A very very tasty liqueur. Maybe not quite worth $30 a pop but still quite nice. 1,005 charactersPehlman, Nov 14, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Decided to share a bottle of this with my good buddy Brian in celebration of a new job. Poured and served in a Bruery tulip glass.
A: Probably the thickest and darkest looking brew I've every had! Damn it's viscous! Before opening this bottle, I was a little worried about the amount of carbonation and head this beer was going exhibit (due to the overabundance of alcohol)...but I wasn't let down this time. I discovered that BT was able to produce a beautiful light brown colored head. The only knock would be the lack of head retention and lacing, but overall...a nice looking stout.
S: Took a fresh whiff when I first poured this beast and found the alcohol extremely over the top, but after letting it breathe for 5 or 10 minutes...it seemed to cool off quite a bit. Once this was done, I was able to pick up an assortment of aromas that included: brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, anise, and more brown sugar. Just from the nose, you can tell this is one sticky beer.
T: The alcohol presence szx more subdued than the smell indicated. Again, tons of brown sugar molasses and dark chocolate backed up by vanilla bean, caramel, dark fruit, and anise. I was amazed by the incredible smoothness and cohesion of all the flavors. It's basically the Albert Pujols of beers. Has immense amounts of power and punch...but has a sophistication to hit for a high average. 
M: Mildly carbonated, creamy, full-body; perfect!
D: Thought the bottle version and the higher serving temp would affect the overall drinkability, but I surprised to find this even more drinkable than the tap version. Yeah...you can taste the alcohol presence...but for 19.5%....no other beer within the area code of ABV can compete with BT. 
Overall: The only major difference between the tap and bottle version...at least in my opinion...is the nose. At warmer temps, the alcohol is easily detectable...and at times, felt like I was getting buzzed even before I took a sip. Yet, I was able to extract more flavors and nuances than with the tap version. With that said, BT is among the top Impy stouts in the world. A must try. Cheers! 2,117 charactersOlieIPA, Nov 13, 2009
4.09/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Shared by Newtonty, thanks man!
A: The pour has a black base, with a swirl of dark roasted head. Lacing is a viscous oil that coats the side of the glass. 
S: Stinging bourbon attacks the nose, followed by an onslaught of sweet malts. You can tell this beer is going to be massive just by smelling it
M/T: Medium, oily body coats the tongue and the roof of the mouth. Next comes the sting from the high APV drying out the pallet, only to be finished by huge maple flavor. The maple flavor is very sweet and overwhelming after the 3rd swallow. The taste is too reminiscent of other big bourbon stouts out there. 
D: Huge alcohol, malts and maple. Couldn't drink too much of this. It appears to me that the brewer threw everything in the book at this beer and left nothing left to chance. Huge alcohol, huge bourbon, huge malts. There is nothing subtle about this whatsoever. Doing so, I think it lost some appeal with me. I think its smoother than other big dogs out there, but I am not getting on the hype train with this one. 1,030 charactersDrewOSU, Nov 13, 2009

Amazing packaging adorn this one with a fine, black wax head.
From luke warm, put in a freezer 20 minutes, then removed. The initial temp during the pour was a little too cold for my tastes.
Pours in my snifter as dark as a starless night. Black with a dark cocoa head with small bubbles. Only a faint halo remains after a few minutes in my snifter. A fine topaz ring can be see around the edges of my glass.
The nose on this one is VERY big, even at the present cold temperature. Big, woody, yet sweet malts, nuances of sweet flavors like vanilla, caramel and molasses. It's like a malt extract or Caro syrup in it's thickness. I get faint cocoa, big dark chocolate fudge and black licorice, at times, as well. Very big and complex overall. Sublime...
The mouth reflects the nose on this. This is a not a beer for the mild... Even at it's current cold temperature, I can't get over the thickness (chewiness) in the mouthfull. It's like drinking an oil slick mixed with maple syrup! This beer, at times, reminds me of the blending involved with the Firestone Walker anniversary beers. Overall, I get a mix of flavors including big, sweet malts, aggressive sweetness, vanilla, chocolate, figs, black licorice and caramel. The flavors are huge and in your face the entire time. I was actually surprised how little alcohol burn there was through out, but it was present.
This beer is very complex, but not "in your face, big with flavors", but it actually is at the same time. It was almost too sweet for me at times, like the brewer intentionally added as many core ingredients to the beer before turning this liquid into a solid!
Wow, lots going on, recommended. 1,782 charactersbeachbum1975, Nov 13, 2009
4.46/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5I can't give enough thanks to Scott and David for the opportunity. Here it goes:
Poured into my tulip glass, I am greeted with a nice finger of mocha colored head that I didn't expect from a beer this strength. After it settles, a nice collar forms and leaves an oily residue in its trail. A quick swirl of the glass causes the head to rise back up about a quarter inch high and leave a trail of sticky goo on the the glass wherever it made contact with the liquid. Really awesome and really menacing.
The smell on this is hot hot hot....I have been agitating it quite a bit as I sit here and stare at the glass, and the volatiles are being released and absolutely invade the sinuses with blistering force. Underneath is a dense mishmash of everything you would ever want in an imperial stout. Chocolate, toffee, vanilla, oak, raisins, plums, marshmallows, candy sweetness....oops, another swirl of the glass brings back that potent heat. Really quite nice, and somewhat intimidating. Probably deserves a 5 while sitting still, but I'm dropping this score a bit to reflect the high booziness that peeks out. But now I must have a taste...
...and I am in heaven. But damn heaven is hot as hell. I'm actually really surprised at how many people have stated that this beer drinks like it is only half its strength, because I personally would guess 14-15% if I didn't know any better. Still, that is significantly lower than its actual ABV.
Now onto the actual flavor, which I guess I haven't even touched upon yet. Everything I mentioned in the smell is here in some form or another, but surprisingly nothing really jumps out and takes the forefront. All of this humongous flavor is insanely well balanced. Richly decadent, this beast is a dessert and a half. You basically have to plan your whole night around drinking this. After a while the sweetness starts to really take the forefront, luckily it is not cloying for my palate.
The mouthfeel is full and creamy and very well carbonated. Heavy, yet enough bubbles to engulf the entire mouth with flavor. Just how it should be.
Drinkability improves after you get a few ounces in you. The booziness subsides, and the amazing flavors underneath come to the forefront. I think 8 oz. is probably the perfect serving size for this, so split your bottle 3 ways for best results. I really wish this came in 12 oz. bottles or smaller, because I would like to be able to drink it more often. An absolutely stunning beer. 2,467 charactersalcstradamus, Nov 12, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The much hyped Black Tuesday shared generously by Shane. I also managed to score a bottle thanks to Weibull, thanks, Jason! While it took a while to finish this, it was anything but a chore.
Looking at this beer, I ask myself: How much blacker can a beer get? The answer, my friends, is None more black. A dense dark brown head is present, hanging around leaving some foam as it settles into a ring. Incredibly dark, this beer has gorgeous legs, the only way I was able to tell that the the alcohol might be up there.
What an exceptional nose! Rich and layerd with rich chocolate cake, vanilla and bourbon. Devoid of alcohol, this is really quite outrageous. Reminiscent of OADL. Even the chocolate character is outrageously rich - I get layers of milk and dark chocolate as well as some cocoa powder. The vanilla is exceptionally incorporated and the bourbon is outstanding. Very faint rummy character, with some dark fruit - raisins soaked in bourbon and rum. Malted milk balls are present too. I have to mention that this is sweet, but also balanced, much along the lines of Dark Horizon 1st Ed. World Wide Stout/Darkness, this is not.
The palate opens with a ton of sweetness, mildly sugary with a rich and delicious molasses character. A touch sweet for my taste, this is still very very good. A lot of the chocolate complexity appears early on, with dark and milk chocolate character. Nougat like with toffee, bourbon and vanilla appear mid palate. Oak is reserved and while present, it's whelmed by the sweetness. Big in body with soft and smooth carbonation, the finish is LONG lasting with plenty of flavor, vanilla, bourbon and chocolate. Every now and then, I get a touch of a meaty character too. The alcohol is exceptionally well hidden. 
Evaluating the drinkability of a beer like this is difficult. While not quaffable, I have to admit that I drank 6oz of my 8oz pour in about 20 minutes and had to really hold myself back in the better interests of my sobriety. This really is a feat of brewing, thanks for sharing this with us, Shane.
**Edit 26 March 2011**
I shared a bottle of the 2010 batch at our Philly tasting.
The nose is a lot simpler - soy sauce and bourbon, brown sugar, booze, caramel. The palate opens with plenty of sugar, caramel, booze, brown sugar, vanilla, and all things sweet. Prunes, dates, raisins, rummy and bourbon are present. Intense. Sweet and moderately boozy on the finish, there's some port. Not as chocolate-like as the 09, there's a stunning lack of all things stout - no roast, no coffee, no chocolate. More of an American Strong Ale imo. 4.5/4/4.5/4/4
**Edit 23 Dec 2011**
Devin shared a bottle last night. Holy fucking fuck, is this beer a hot and boozy mess or what? It tastes like they dumped fucking Everclear in this, it's sinus-clearing boozy with plenty of chocolate and vanilla. Just too fucking intense, this vintage is nothing like the 2009. S/T/M=3.5/2.5/3
**Edit 26 Dec 2012**
Drinking a bottle of the 2011 release with my dad.
Hot, boozy, moderately messy, but a lot more enjoyable. Sweet caramel, vanilla and booze with some chocolate and dark fruit. The palate is similarly big and boozy, with plenty of vanilla and alcohol. Very sugary, this has some chocolate, but is mostly devoid of roast, chocolate and coffee. Enjoyable in small quantities.

A - Dark black pour with a DARK brown head. Possibly the darkest head I've ever seen.
S - Intoxicating. Bourbon, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, vanilla...and chocolate. Very nice. Compare it to brownies or chocolate cake.
T - Bourbon and vanilla, followed by caramel, rich toffee, and....wait for it...chocolate. Surprisingly little alcohol for a beer of this stature. 
M - Silky smooth mouthfeel, heavy body and soft carbonation. Feels like liquid silk in your mouth.
D - This was the only place I could ding points. This is not an easy drinker. It is a meal, and takes a while to drink by yourself...and I did. I wouldn't change anything about the beer, its just doesn't have the drinkability of some lower ABV stouts.
Overall - This is the new standard. Hope you got some bottles of it. 811 charactersnqualls, Nov 10, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 edition generously shared by Shane. Thanks! Enjoyed this one over the course of a couple hours with Shane and Dyan. This provided a nice contrast to all the bottles of lambic we opened that day.
The pour is black and opaque, impressively dark for the style. It's even black around the edges, and the head is nearly black itself. I'd describe this beer as black.
It smells strongly of bourbon and brownies. The bourbon imparts a strong aroma of caramel, which is supported by a huge chocolate malt foundation. Where's the alcohol? I have no idea. At 19.5% ABV, it's unbelievable how mellow this is. While it's not the most complex stout I've come across, it's certainly a feat of brewing.
The taste opens with bourbon, vanilla, toffee and bittersweet chocolate. Rich and full-bodied, but surprisingly it's neither syrupy nor cloying. Very little heat, and no harshness - I've tried -bal aged beers of half the ABV that tasted hotter. Amazing. Molasses-like sweetness along with a mild roastiness appear mid-palate. Carbonation is fairly ample, enough to give the beer a lively texture and ward off the taste of alcohol. The finish is sweet, a bit woody, with lingering flavors of coffee, caramel and slight alcohol. It's warming going down, the only indication that this is anywhere near 19.5%.
Drinkability isn't especially high, it did take me a couple hours to finish 1/3 of a bottle, but with that said it never became cloying or harsh - it's just such a filling and intense beer that I can't see myself wanting to drink it often or in large quantities. 1,565 characterslargadeer, Nov 10, 2009
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally opening this bad boy for the occasion of my 100th review. I absolutely loved this stuff on tap at the release and I can't wait to find out if it's as good in the bottle. From notes 11/08/09 shared with a friend. 750ml bottle poured into a Bruery tulip. Can't help but hear the guitar riff from the famous poolside scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High as I pour this epic brew...
This pours about as black as beer comes. Very briefly forms a medium sized tan head with strong red highlights then fades away almost completely. Leaves near zero lacing as I swish it around the glass.
Aroma jumps right out of the bottle and up the nostrils even before you pour it. Strong scents of chocolate and vanilla compete for supremacy as the dominant smell and it's really not clear which comes out on top. I'm getting some maraschino cherries in the background as well. Very nice.
Strong dark chocolate and powdery cocoa notes continue on the palate along with a hefty dose of anise, some maple syrup, blackberries, and a very faint trace of coffee. As was the case on tap, alcohol heat is conspicuous by its relative absence. Don't know how they did it. Oaky vanilla is still detectable here but not as much of a major player as it was on the aroma. I'm not picking up much in the way of distinct Bourbon and wood notes common in Bourbon barrel aged beers other than the vanilla, which actually starts to reassert itself as the beer warms up.
Feel is creamy and light, not as thick as the most viscous beers in the style but it works well in this case. Carbonation is actually a little on the low side but I was so distracted with the flavors I would never have noticed if feel wasn't one the categories on this site. I don't like soda-like carbonation on stouts though so no complaints. It seems ridiculous to call this 19.5 abv monster highly drinkable but it's true. Too easy to drink actually, in a sense I'm almost glad this is not easily available. If this was a regular I'd drink it to the point of intoxication on a regular basis.
Hype aside, this is overall one of the more interesting beers I've tried recently. It's definitely an extreme beer though, so probably not for everyone. It's quite an accomplishment in itself making a beer this strong that isn't a sticky cloying mess, let alone making one that's highly drinkable and delicious but Patrick and the crew nailed it. 2,389 charactersberkey, Nov 09, 2009
4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5OK, so my first foray into rating beers officially on this site. Reviewing from last night's notes upon my opening my first bottle. Offhandedly, this was just as good as on-tap at the release. It's marginally better than the first time I had it, some months back at the Bruery, where I thought the body was a little thin. 
Appearance is pitch black, light ruddy edges of brown. Thick, viscous, though not as akin to used motor oil as Dark Lord. So happy to see a small, coffee-colored head at the top. It stays the whole time. A swirl of the glass coats the interior, so that the glass itself is stained brown.
Smell is exceptional - just a bit of boozy heat, which I like. Powerful aroma, with dark fruit, rich dark chocolate, coffee, and a touch of bourbon. Not my favorite-smelling stout, but it's way up there.
Taste... well, suffice to say that this is the best tasting imperial stout I've ever had. Massive dark fruit, roasted coffee, a bit of chocolate, and some heat. But seriously, you cannot tell me that this is 20%. The taste tells me 10%. Is that cherry I taste? Where the hell did that come from? Pretty sweet too, but somehow it works. An epic after-dinner beer.
Mouthfeel is crazy good. Thick, viscous, with enough carbonation that it feels alive in your mouth.
Drinkability is the only, and I mean only spot where I can take off any points. I was actually struggling with whether to give a 5 or a 4.5 here. Because honestly, I don't think it's possible for a beer of this strength and complexity to be any more drinkable than BT is. However, this beer is almost too much... you definitely need one or two people to share it with, because this is a damn beast. Sooo... yes, I will have to give it a 4.5.
Overall: This is probably my favorite beer of all-time. It's certainly among the most complex and well-constructed beers I've ever had. Hot damn, I'm glad that I've got more of this. Don't listen to the cynics that tell you that this beer is "overly hyped" or that its scores are artificially inflated. This beer is the real deal. It would be tough to claim that there's any better imperial stout out there. 2,133 charactersdavod23, Nov 09, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A huge thanks to jhenry04 for coming through for me on this one in a very fair and reasonable trade.
I served this at 54 degrees into my Dogfish Head snifter. On first pour, there is very little carbonation until five seconds or so pass and a nice stream of bubbles begins to work its way to the surface. A frothy, Cappuccino-like head forms on a second vigorous pour. Swirling this around in the glass produces tremendous legs like a fine sherry or port.
The smell is outstanding. As soon as I worked my way through the two layers of black wax and pried off the cap, a beautiful caramel, cocoa aroma was released. Sticking my nose deep into the snifter I get a host of bourbon-like flavors ranging from vanilla to toffee to sultana raisins. Gorgeous. I spent a good ten minutes just inhaling the aromas before taking my first sip. There was certainly a strong presence of alcohol in the nose which was leading me to believe that this would be quite hot.
Upon my first taste I was immediately struck by how the nose transfered to the taste in every way but one - the alcohol was much more subdued than what I expected. Notes of muscovado sugar, plums and candied pecans all come through on subsequent sips. This is heady stuff!
Mouthfeel was tremendous. Very viscous but never chewy. A perfect amount of carbonation for the high alcohol and a fantastic achievement considering it's nearly 40 proof! 
Drinkability is off the charts for the style and high alcohol content. Despite the heat in the nose and very sweet body, it never becomes hot or cloying. Beautifully done!
In retrospect Black Tuesday resembles Utopias, the FW Anniversary beers, MS Arctic Devil Barleywine and even J.W. Lees Harvest Ale more than it does many of the top Imperial Stouts out there.
Is this the best beer in the world? One could certainly argue for or against and have valid points on both sides. What is indisputable to me is that Black Tuesday is a tremendous brewing achievement that shows great finesse in a huge package. All I know is that I spent nearly two hours drinking this beer and when I swirled the last sip in my mouth and swallowed I was deeply satiated. 2,157 charactersRochefort10nh, Nov 08, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Here goes...
Appearance is surprisingly good, usually when you get this high into ABV you are looking at near stillness. This is black as can be with a very nice head and lacing.
Scent is just fantastic. Nowhere near as boozy as some several percentage points less. Rasins, other dark fruits, bourbon, vanilla, and maple syrup hit me as I opened the bottle. 
Taste, while not nearly as boozy as several beers with quite a bit less alcohol, is still a tad on the boozy side, which I feel is the only thing keeping this from a perfect 5. The dark fruits and a sweet maple presence make themselves known, along with the vanilla, smoke, light wood.
Mouth is just great, a great level of carbonation that I would consider medium level overall, and a pretty suitably thick feel. 
Overall, this is a really incredible achievement in the style. Managing to get the ABV this high, and having it not taste like rocket fuel and fire, LET ALONE having it taste damn good in the process, is just amazing. 996 characterssonicdescent, Nov 07, 2009

Lacing drips vertically down the glass rather than horizontally. Reeks of bourbon, charred oak, molasses, possibly chocolate cake, and dried dark fruits. Tastes like a vanilla bourbon truffle with a sprinkle of espresso. Coffee flavor comes out in the finish in what is otherwise dominated by bourbon, molasses and vanilla. The taste of Tuesday lingers for over a minute after each sip is gone. Taste buds are saturated and nearly overwhelmed by the depth of flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, but lightened by adequate carbonation. Considering the 19.5% abv, the drinkability is silly. An amazing beer that is the best of its style. 753 charactersJRhode, Nov 07, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5If my memory serves me right, there are five excuses for drinking: a house guest arriving, being thirsty at the moment, having a thirst to come in the future, the innate goodness of beer, or, really, any reason of which you can think. (thus is my liberal interpretation and translation of a Pere Sermond)
This has been outside all day, so it should be about 50° F. poured into my la fin du monde tulip glass. 
What music to listen to when reviewing such an epic beer? Bach's chaccone, bvw 1004? no, too solemn. Dark side of the moon? No, I'm not getting high after all. Some Monk? No, I need to conjure grandeur, not cool. I think such a beer deserves the most epic song of them all: The Final Countdown. Yes, that will do. Now, where's that repeat button?
A - this beer is a freakin' black hole! Charon denies any light entrance into this stygian glass of ambrosia. pitch, tar, midnight, whatever you want to call it, this brew is as black as Medea's child-killing heart. the liquid itself pours at a seemingly reasonable viscosity, no the motor oil that dark lord is. the head is the perfect colour, it is a perfect medium-dark tan colour. the head is big, aforementioned, and quite light, not creamy at all. the head slowly fizzes down, begging me to fill in the gap left in the tulip; i indulge my new mistress with her request. a solid 1cm layer of foam stays on the top of the beer at all times. 
S - the smell is more intense than Frank Dux fighting in the kumite. the nose hits you in the face like a ton of bricks: top notes of booze, bourbon, and oak; middle notes of molasses, prunes, burnt sugar; the base notes are of huge dark malts, roasted and excellent and a slight vinous hint. the sheer power of the oak and whiskey can be overwhelming, it's like they made a barrel out of the mighty Pelian ash itself, or out of all the grandest trees on Mt. Ida. if nothing else: it smells like i'm in an alcoholic cooper's shop. the sheer amount of booze and the need to sift through this bastion of an aroma might be a turn off for some, it might be too much for their noses, not I: I have suffered my body day and night, depriving my self of food and sleep, toughening my body to prepare for the romance of this beer (not really though). for whatever it is worth: styles aside, i can still say I prefer the nose of W.12, but that is probably because I like Belgian styles the most; this beer hold a firm grasp on second place.
T - the taste, oh the taste! I think I have a new favorite stout, yes, indeed I do! Drinking this beer is like taking a bite out of barrel, but one made of deliciousness. That wasn't very descriptive now was it? Let's try that again: if you could encapsulate the experience of getting a bj while holding in one hand my Svend Bang tiger stripe pipe with a bowl full of balkan sobranie aged since the 80's stripe pipe, a glass of '26 Macallan in the other hand (pick any drink you please if you dont like scotch), while having just won the world poker tour on the top turret of Schloss Neuschwanstein. Crude? yes. Accurate? I believe so. Now, onto the taste. the initial taste is a powerhouse of flavours: vanilla, bourbon, oak, malts, fermenting fruits, and some some maple syrup. the alcohol (which I find hard to believe is so high) really does a number on the palate, and I love every second of its burning fury. the finish burns like Troy in the hands of the Danaans. the finish too is hugely boozy, burning, savory with a big molasses aspect and slightly sweet like prunes. a fitting finish for such a beer. the brew doesn't expand in taste like some others, it stays pretty much the same in the taste, the only thing changing is the alcohol, which is what I wanted: the booze in the initial is generally burning (if you hold it in your moth for long enough), but in the finish, pending on how long you kept it in your mouth, can be burning or an amazing dry fruity experience. Some coffee like flavours come out as well in this finish, particularly in the acidic bitter way that coffee tends to finish. the aftertaste is completely different; true it still is a large part of oak and booze, there is a definite chocolate, coffee, caramel/brown burnt sugar aspect that jumps out. having such dynamism in a beer is what makes the few and the proud full score brews.
MF&D - the carbonation is a bit low on this guy, but I find it enough for something with so much flavour and booze. the lack of carbonation is justified when one realizes the body isn't like a motor oil, it is thiner, and thus to get that syrupy feel some absence of carbonation is required. drinkablility? oh man, for a beer with 19.5% abv this brew is like drinking silk. the booze never chokes me up, never makes me gag, it goes down with its lovely burning and thats the end of that. it is a masterful piece of brewing and I wish that I could have regular access to such a prize of a beer. 4,903 characterserz316, Nov 06, 2009

A - Deep and dark almost pitch black, the slightest of brown highlights when held to the light. A thin cappucinno head that disappears immediately and leaves swirling lines of bubbles on the surface and a thin collar around the edge of the glass.
S - Smells of licorice, dark caramel, malt extract, port wine, medium/dark (50% cacao) chocolate, bourbony, a hint of vanilla. 
T - A liquid truffle. Sweet, chocolately, smooth bourbon touched, caramel, touch of vanilla, molasses, sugar, brown sugar,. Really complex flavors - great!
M - Thick, syrupy...low carbonation. Sugary sweetness coats the entire mouth. Really good. 
Warmth from the bourbon, malty, sugary sweetness - this all just works.
D - Unbelievably drinkable...19.5%, really? Drinks like a much lower alcohol beer. This is unbelievably good stuff. Thinking about cracking a second bottle, but don't think the trading partners who already have this reserved would appreciate that. 1,033 charactersportia99, Nov 01, 2009
3.28/5  rDev -26.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Had on tap at the release party Nov 27.
Poured a nice jet black with small tan head. A swirl of the glass left a thick residue on the side. Awesome.
Smelled of bourbon and dark fruit. I am almost able to get drunk off inhaling this stuff , its so hot..
One sip and you realize this isnt an ordinary beer. There is plenty of stout style flavors in this ; Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, a bit of a grainy flavor as well, like a chewy nutty taste. However the alc% just bites right through all of it at times when i wish it hadn't. The flavors are just too big all around at this time, an d i wonder how this will age.
Mouthfeel is just about right, as is isnt too thick like bourbon county.
One 4 oz taster and i was feelin pretty buzzed, i couldnt drink a whole bottle alone, or even 2 people probably. It's like drinking liquor with alot more flavor than usual.
Overall I am glad i didnt spend 30$ on a bottle because this to me isn't as good as say The Abyss, and thats 12$. 978 charactersArceo, Oct 30, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at the Bruery both at Allocation sale time, and at release on 10/27. First review deleted due to site problems.
Jet black, opaque, dark tan head, that really sticks to a glass as you roll it around. Smell is bourbon, some coffee, some chocolate, roasted malts, and sugars.
Taste is not overpowering in borubon, which is great; it just adds to the complexity. Definitely some chocolate and a very high amount of sugar considering the ABV. Not much hotness/alcohol. Don't find much oak there.
Carbonation is well done (on tap at least), and is truly necessary to make this a drinkable beer. I'm not one for syrupy beers that are not highly carbonated (not overly fond of 120min or flat angel's share). 
If I didn't start to feel it after a few pours, I would not believe the 19.5% ABV. Impressive. 806 charactersantilogic, Oct 29, 2009

Smell: bourbon molasses vanilla chocolate and a slight hint of booze
Taste: chocolate bourbon and strong molasses followed by trailing notes of vanilla. this is one hell of a beer. had a fair amount of alcohol burn when it was cold, but after warming up alcohol was barely noticeable
Mouth-feel: thick and a tad bit syrupy. slight carbonation. 
Drinkability: Quite amazing how well this drank for being 19.5%.

poured jet black into my bruery tulip, with an intimidating one and a half finger head floating atop this bad boy that had an exceptional amount of lacing on the glass. light couldn't get through this if it had to. beautiful.
smell is rich and full of chocolate malts, bourbon, wood, toffee, powdered cocoa with a slight hint of booze near the back. I already have a smile on my face.
taste is great from the second it hits your lips. my palate is enveloped in amazing flavors. chocolate bourbon port toffee creamy sugar/toasted caramel. this beer literally elicited a "woah" out of me after the first sip. I am seriously impressed.
mouthfeel is creamy and full. rich and robust. with just the right amount of carbonation to be refreshing. wait a 19.5 percent beer is refreshing...go figure.
If you hadnt told me the abv i wouldnt have been able to tell you what it was. remarkable. I have to admit I was skeptical going into it but I would gladly say that this beer is worthy of its hype and I really hope more people get to try it. 1,216 charactersMauerhan, Oct 28, 2009

Smell: bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, brown sugar.
Taste: chocolate, port, bourbon, vanilla, oakiness, brown sugar, caramel, and a malty finish. Complex, balanced, drinkable.
Mouth: Very thick and flavorful all the way down. Not much alcohol taste or burn at all amazingly. Can't believe that this beer is this strong and you can't tell.
Overall: It's the best IS I've ever had. I'm shocked by the abv and it is way more drinkable than any other beer or wine of this strength I've had. More drinkable than many beers of half this strength, perfect score for drinkability.
Serving type: on-tap at the Bruery release 663 charactersbiggied, Oct 28, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed on-tap at the release in a Bruery snifter.
Pours opaque and pitch black, with only a tiny bit of dark brown head. Smell is chocolate, caramelized sugar, and loads of sweet malts, with some bourbon as well. I was glad that the bourbon wasn't overdone. Too much would have ruined the excellent balance of this great beer. Taste is right in line with the aroma, primarily sweet chocolate and bourbon, but again not overdone. The big surprise is that there is no note of alcohol. I'm not sure how there can be nearly 20% alcohol in this beer! This is a big, full bodied monster of a beer, but the carbonation (not high, but appropriate) made it a smooth drink.
I was pleasantly surprised with Black Tuesday versus Chocolate Rain. While the additional blast of chocolate and vanilla in the cask version was wonderful, the carbonation in Black Tuesday balanced the beer out and made it much more enjoyable to drink. I believe I read about someone doing a 50/50 blend, which probably would have been delicious! I wish I would have thought of it.
The lack of head was my only gripe with this beer. It seems quite cold when served, so perhaps if it were poured a bit warmer there would have been more of a head. Regardless, this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted.
There was some discussion at the release regarding aging Black Tuesday, but I'm not sure what it could gain. If the bottles are force carbonated and not bottle conditioned, then they should be ready to drink and I can't imagine this beer getting any smoother. 1,536 characterssrroos, Oct 28, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The pour is black. It was poured straight from the source. I wrapped my nose inside the tulip glass and it smelled like bourbon,molasses, and burnt caramel. So many different flavors that smack you as soon as the beer hits your palate. It is well balanced, and does not feel like a 19.5 alcohol beer. It has an aftertaste that reminds you of a chocolaty licorice(good licorice taste) taste. It is a thick mouthful, causing one to fill a full bodied beer full of sweetness and dark malts. I did not taste any bitterness in the beer, and it still tasted great. If you do not like imperial stouts, then you will probably still love this beer. It is very drinkable, and after one sip the palate craves another drink. 712 charactersNRa4ever, Oct 28, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A-JET black, with a fat brown head, and some STICKY lacing that reaches for miles on my Bruery glass. Head lasts a long long time, and there are little bubbles of co2 heading up the side of the glass.
S- 2000 servings of nesQuik, bourbon, toffee, mocha, and anise.
T- Incredible, there is virtually no trace of alcohol in this beast, save for a little warming feeling on the far reaches of your palate. absolutely incredible beer. Last time i had a beer of this style and hype i was let down but this one is CARBONATED, but not overly so, and so complex it makes you wonder how a brewery torqued out a beer like this months after it was founded, and released just a year later....wow....mad props to Patrick who I had the honor of meeting at this release. 
M- Sticky, foamy, lasting, complex, spicy, roasty, and very deceivingly toxic to your liver!
D- I had no idea a beer of this ABV could be so drinkable but in a tasting i would put this up against a port wine. Gave it a 4.5 because its almost like molasses in the finish. 1,031 charactersslayer3604, Oct 28, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I feel like such a homer and a feeder of the hype-machine by giving this beer such an amazing review, but I cannot help it. It deserves it.
A: Black Tuesday is jet black and has one of the best heads I've seen. A finger or so of mocha colored foam that has incredible staying power. If it didn't taste so good, it would be great to just look at it in the glass.
S: As one might expect from a beer as big and bold as this, there are great aromas of bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, sugar, and surprisingly mild alcohol.
T: The flavor is strikingly similar to the aroma (no shock there). The huge chocolate and bourbon barrel flavors are the first to knock your socks off. As you continue to enjoy the beer, you pick up on some dark fruits and licorice, along with some sweeter flavors of vanilla and brown sugar. Eventually the alcohol burn starts to creep in as the beer warms.
M: The carbonation on this beer is low, but the bubbles help to keep it from being too heavy and overwhelming. I find it to be a great match for the flavors and the enormous body of Black Tuesday.
D: Well, this could do well to sit in a cellar for about 5 years. But, it's still so wonderful now that I would not turn a serving down. This is one beer that truly has lived up to its hype (for me, anyway) and I look forward to sharing my bottles and my friends bottles whenever we feel so moved. An absolutely world class beverage! 1,423 characterswomencantsail, Oct 28, 2009

Had on tap, poured by Patrick Rue @ GABF....a few times by the way. Besides Supplication, this is the best beer i have ever experienced, hands down best Imperial Stout. 
Poured black, sucking in the ambient light and showing a mocha head, tight carbonation. Aromas of vanilla, freshly baked - toasted biscotti, some oak, roasted coffee, some dark fruit - cranberry and currants come to mind, roasted pecans. Taste is creamy mocha, vanilla, and oaky bourbon. So well balanced it's sick. Mouthfeel is smooth, chewy, but lends a pleasant viscosity. Not fusel at all, Black Tuesday is 19.5% but drinks like 9%. 
So beautifully executed. Patrick is a pioneer and a true alchemist - blending art and science into something that really speaks volumes of American ingenuity. 939 charactersbrandoneast, Oct 27, 2009

Huge brew, alc and bourbon are not that noticable esp considering the alc level is 18-19%. Great part is if you ever open one of these you will need several people to share 1 bottle with. Dark rich thick sticky bourbon. like sweetened condensed milk but with stout and bourbon. not that sweet i guess. super complex and it opened up and grew bigger with just a couple minutes in a glass. not sure how / if this will age. hoping a long long time but it's a freak and can't wait to re-rate from my own bottle and the black rain! 623 characterspaytoplay, Oct 11, 2009

Oily black color with no head
Aroma was burnt chocolate cookies, maple, and smoke.
Some of the flavors were tobacco, black strap molasses, chocolate. Quite sweet overall with noticable alcohol but neither were putting us off.
Not much carbontion, viscous mouthfeel with a long, hot, sweet finish.
There was a huge line for this one, worth the wait. Their other beers are also wonderful. 407 charactersbrownbeer, Sep 29, 2009

Mouth: Very thick and flavorful all the way down. Not much alcohol taste or burn at all amazingly.
Overall: The best IS I've ever had. Since it's my favorite style that makes it my favorite beer I've ever had. 
I'm shocked by the abv. Way more drinkable than any other beer of this strength I've had, and more drinkable than many beers of half this strength, which is why I awarded a perfect score for drinkability.
I've had KBS, BS, BCS, peche mortel, speedway, stone RIS, and this beats them all.
I have not had darkness, dark lord, or DFH WWS, so cannot compare, but have 2 out of 3 in the cellar so will note on comparisons when I pop them. 886 charactersbret27, Sep 28, 2009

IMO, this is World Wide Stout meets the bourbon barrel.
no shock to anyone, this pours black, with lots of bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar and other flavors. It's complex, tasty, and basically great. The smooth chocolatey flavors of the stout are complemented wonderfully by the vanilla/oaky bourbon barrel notes. This is an extremely well crafted beer. 407 charactersjcalabre, Aug 17, 2009

I have been blessed enough to have this beverage at least 15 to 20 times by now. Simply a glorious beer! Originally on tap at the brewery (Bruery?) Pours with a large brown head over a black body. Alcohol legs, brown coating and lace all left behind on the glass. Aroma of tar, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits, and caramel. Taste is dark fruits, tar, bourbon, oak, candi sugar, plums, tobacco and bitter chocolate. Extremely long duration. Super viscous mouthfeel, light carbonation, amazing! Hides alcohol immensely well, does not taste or go down like 19.5% (not even close)! Really looking forward to the bottles. Fantastic beer. I never thought I could find a single beer from them better than Melange #3, but it turns out that a comment of that beer was better than the sum that made Melange Numero Three! 923 charactersBMan1113VR, Aug 14, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Quite simply the absolute best Imperial Stout that has ever graced my tastebuds!
Poured into a tulip glass, it presents an alluring visual sea of rich, dark liquid as expected of this style.
The treat really begins with the first twirl of the glass lifting toward the nose. Beautifully balanced and not overpowering, essences of bourbon and dark fruits and toffee envelop the olfactory glands with delight. 
This beer seems to present only the finest characteristics of the aromas presented, all working together in harmony. There is nothing harsh. No overpowering alcohol. You would never know from the aroma that this liquid is 19.5% ABV.
On to the flavors, where this beer is a form of liquid black gold. As with the aromas, the flavors present a perfectly balanced dance of dark fruits and dark chocolate/toffee enhanced by mild woody bourbon notes that give it an elegance without any off-putting bite. No harsh alcohol whatsoever. 
This beer invites sip after sip. It draws you in with an addictive presentation of symbiotic flavors; all of which are meant to be there. It is world class. 
If you live in SoCal you must visit the brewery (The Bruery) to taste this beer. If you don't live there, book a ticket and fly there to taste this beer! Anybody can go to Disneyland. This is the magic kingdom of Imperial Stouts!

A: Very dark and thick with a thin tan head that stayed that way throughout. Nice legs on the sides of the glass.
S: Deep notes of coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, some dark fruits, and hints of brown sugar sweetness.
T: Very similar to the nose and very, very strong-tasting. The alcohol is present, but is certainly not overpowering, blending in quite well. 
M: Quite smooth and medium-full bodied. My only complaint at all about this beer is that it could have been a little more fuller-bodied with a more creamy texture.
D: Exceedingly drinkable. A four-ounce pour is not nearly enough. It's too bad the pre-orders were all filled up, but I'm incredibly happy that I ended up in Orange County at just the right time! 812 charactersThorpe429, Aug 10, 2009

A - pitch black, fairly thin tan head with some light lacing.
S - dark fruits, figs, dates, prunes, bourbon, apricot
T - Very complex. Coffee, chocolate, roasted maltyness, smokiness, dark fruits: like figs, prunes, dates, vanilla, sweet, brown sugar, oak and of course, the ever prominent bourbon backing.
M - Pretty slippery on the tongue, but also coats your tongue. Low to moderate carbonation.
D - ABV is EXTREMELY well hidden. And not to sweet like most high ABV beers. Although this is IS a little bit sweet for a stout, it's very balanced. A little hot, but not what you'd think, it's scary drinkable. I would compare this to GI BCS, but a ton more complex, higher ABV, and more drinkable. 761 charactersmikedashg, Aug 04, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5There's no reason for me to get long winded with this. I should recognize that everything has NOT been said about this beer so far, but that's it's draw - it's unbelievably complex. so far the norm on this is giving an essay length review, and it's TOTALLY warranted. This beer is hands down amazing.
I think I got a LITTLE short changed on the 4oz pour, but there was no need to complain, it was just as attractive and worth it as it would have been otherwise. pitch black with a tight, almost sandy in consistency head. after receding, a twirl of the glass would cause the crown to mimic the look of a nebulous cloud... really an awesome looking beer whose nose, taste, mouthfeel and overall drinkablility agreed with the look of it completely.
smelled caramely, nutty and sweet like molasses. the balance on this beer between the bourbon and malts was truly remarkable. full, creamy and completely masking the size of this beer, no one has exaggerated even a touch.
I liken this beer to GI BCS... only 20x more drinkable... if you can believe it. I had to ration myself on the size of my sips as it was going down so unbelievably smooth.
if the bottles end up as the draft did, this beer is truly worth the hype... and if this were ebay, I would leave feedback saying "Great beer! Would do business again! AAA+++".
and it looks like I got a little lengthy anyway... sorry. 1,380 charactersEliottJW, Aug 04, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The hype train is officially leaving the station. I am hopping on board.
Appearance - Black. A dark sky on a stormy night at sea. The absence of light. It has a very nice mocha colored head that even seems to have a little froth. The head sticks around and gathers at the bottom of the glass when finished. It looks fantastic. Of the RIS I've head, this might be the finest looking one.
Smell - Wonderfully complex. Lots of vanilla. A hint of bourbon as well. Also, it seems like a little oak and smoke. The slightest glimmer of coffee and roast malt. Definitely some chocolate. Finally, toasted marshmallows. I agonized over this score for about fifteen minutes. It's no worse than a 4.5, that's for sure. 
Taste - Where to begin? Cherry. Also, lots of that vanilla. The oak and smoke makes the tiniest appearance. There is the bourbon as well. About a hundred flavors I'm not quite identifying. There is a real sweetness, it's like the sweet roasted marshmallow. I swear there's some honey in there. There is a tiny fraction of roast malt bitterness on the end that is less than desirable. 
Mouthfeel - Superb. It's about the richest, creamiest, most decadent thing imaginable. It's like hot chocolate. But there is enough carbonation that it's not a flat mess. Coats the tongue. Lovely. 
Drinkability - I flat out refuse to believe that this is almost 20% alcohol. That's half as strong as vodka. The only reason I might believe it is because I felt a little tipsy afterwards. This shit is lethal. Smooth as hell. 
Damn. I wanted to not really like this beer, and here I sit. There are three things I really can't debate. 1: It looks great. Not quite sure how a RIS could possibly look better. 2: The mouthfeel is fantastic. Even the lady friend who never notices that sort of thing said, "you have to mention how great that mouthfeel was!" 3: It may be impossible to have a more drinkable 20% beer. If anything, I may be selling this short. I'm going to re-review when I get my bottles when there isn't so much hubbub. 
But it's a hell of a beer. (Edit: It was obviously on-tap. I have corrected that.) 2,113 characterscallmescraps, Aug 02, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at The Bruery. The beer is black as night with a decent amount of carbonation. Decent tan lacing. I really hope this level of carbonation shows up in the bottled version.
Surprisingly drinkable for 19.5% abv. I certainly could split a 750 bottle with a friend. The finish comes off slightly sticky sweet bourbon with heavy maple and vanilla (very similar to many the after taste of the Bruery other barrel aged beers). The sweetness leaves me anticipating the next sip.
I think this one is destined for greatness.
(Update: After opening the bottle version of BT, I hereby renew my enthusiasm for Black Tuesday. It's by far my favorite imperial stout. I actually think the bottle version was a little better than the tap.) 731 characterskbm, Jul 30, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Have had a few four ounce glasses at the Bruery in the past few weekends, served in their tulip glass, color is pitch black with not a glimmer of light anywhere, thick sludgy looking stuff, big 1 1/4 inch tan to medium brown foamy and creamy head, good lacing at first, head did not budge for close to five minutes, aroma consists of molasses, oak, rich dark chocolate, some mild coffee, roasted malts, mild port, tobacco, vanilla, sweet cocoa, prunes, burned caramel, and bourbon, flavor starts off with a big oak, taste, some sweet chocolate and vanilla in the middle, finish has a nice syrup taste mixed with tons of oak, bourbon comes through later on more pronounced but nothing major being a hair under twenty percent, easily the top three best tasting beers I have had of this alcohol content, some brown sugar and complex malt flavors come out as it continues to warm, almost like a marshmallow flavor by the end, very creamy with minimal booze in the flavor somehow, dry, roasted, bittersweet, oaky, and chewy mouthfeel, full bodied, very soft carbonation, taste lingers incredibly well, best mouthfeel for a stout that I have come across, drank this with no problem at all, cannjot explain how the alcohol is hidden well but it drinks like a beer maybe have of its ABV, not heavy at all, could down a 750 ml bottle and probably will at a later date, amazing drinkability, one of their best brews yet and that is sure saying a lot, the story about this beer is almost impressive as the beverage itself, this thing is going to age wonderfully too, good thing I was able to get a bunch of bottles to experiment with that, will be drinking again sooner than later, highly recommended 1,689 charactersFloydster, Jul 30, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 519.5%. It is absurd how delicious and drinkable this beer was considering its beastly nature. For such a booze bomb, I was left with a very refined taste. One of if not the best imperial stout I have ever had. I really hope the bottle holds up to the draft.
I can say that the Bruery hadn't impressed me until my trip there in which I got to try Black Tuesday, White Oak and Papier. I am a believer. 400 charactersgregmoscetti, Jul 27, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had at the Bruery Provisions during a homebrew club meeting. Extremely viscous and opaque black. Minimal light seeps through the edges in a brown tint. Small head is dark brown and leaves a surprising amount of lace for such a high alcohol brew.
As expected, nose is full of roast malt, chocolate, and coffee. Lots of honey, bourbon, soy sauce, and sherry-like oxidation notes. 
Very thick, coats the palate. Huge taste of honey and sherry. Lots of roasty coffee and chocolate coupled with notes of bourbon, oak, and a warming alcohol finish. 
This is one big beer. Insanely complex and tasty. Obviously, this one's a sipper. 628 charactersRodBurg, Jul 22, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I'm reluctant to review since I'm throwing in an opinion consistent with those before me! In summary, an all around winner destined for stardom!
I buy into the hype of the "rare," "hard to get" "big alcohol," "one of a kind" stuff as much as the next person. Thus, after driving Steff crazy with e-mails, I'm sure, (and in which she basically said if you want to try it..come down and try it! lol...) I drove down today. Candidly, I've been disappointed, a bit, in some of these hyped, huge alcoholic stouts and "stout type" brews. I am a big fan of "the extreme." I love the huge hops and I love the big, bold stouts. I like 'em all but those are my favorites.
I was ready to taste Black Tuesday, say I did, and then move on. Well, hold your horses...this one is the "real deal."
Thick and viscous out of the bottle the nose hits you with vanilla, whiskey, brandy, dark cherries, vanilla, sweet espresso and sweet Turkish coffee. Wow...
The mouthfeel is like thick cream. It actually initially tastes like you've put a sweet cherried chocolate vanilla carmel bourbon/brandy fudge sauce in your mouth. Then, you get a bit of heat and alcohol, although nothing like the 19+% it is. This is a meal; this is that special dessert; this is simply a gigantic surprise party of flavor, layers and texture. 
While we sipped it at the brewery in our 4 oz pour, I was already planning on the meals at which I'd pour this. First meal will be a huge BBQ, although one could pour this as part of any dessert course, including one of the sweetest and darkest chocolate you could find. 
Shows like a thick Sherry, Madera or Port. See the prior reviews. So far, everyone's right on!
Only possible shortcoming for me (and the only reason I didn't give it 5s across the board) is that many will not find it appealing with most food and find it a sipping beer. Me? I'll drink this puppy with everything from BBQ chicken and ribs to pecan pie!
We may have a new standard for big stouts;....or, we simply may have a whole new catagory... 2,024 charactersGRG1313, Jul 20, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4The bottles won't be released for another three months, but a keg was tapped at the source yesterday. I've known about this beer since May 2008, when me and a buddy sampled this beer when it was still fermenting! Anyways...let's keep the hype train rolling:
Polka dot tan lacing clings to the glass on top the pitch black body. A little paper-thin tan foam caps the body. The aroma...watch out! Very intense, but oh so enjoyable. Very sweet, like vanilla, bourbon, fruit, burnt sugar, and a faint roastiness. 
The aroma, combined with the taste, makes this beer a winner. I was first amazed with how well masked the alcohol was. There is a little heat, but it feels more like 10-11% range of a good beer. It's chocolatey, bourbony, woody, burnt sugary, fruity, and a pinch of boozy. The alcohol had a bit of a cherry flavor. An easy mouthfeel keeps things from getting too cloying, but still heavy and lip-smacking good. Slighty boozy, and it never hangs around for too long. Damn...it's a very slow sipper, but I could sip on it awhile.
I was worried this would be like World Wide Stout or Mikkeller Black and be extremely alcoholic with limited enjoyability. Fortunately, that is not the case. Black Tuesday black out the booze and stimulates the taste buds. Indeed, this is marvelous black water. Oh, and don't fret too much if you miss out on a bottle initially, because this beer will be brewed again in the future. 1,423 charactersDoubleJ, Jul 19, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My real-world alter ego joined Overlord's real-world alter-ego for the opening day of this fine brew. I am exceptionally grateful that he invited me along. 
My initial thought was that a 19.5% brew was going to feel like the bourbon barrel in which it was aged.
I could not have been more wrong. This lives up to the hype. 
I caught a bunch of cocunut on the intial taste that mellowed out to the beautiful nut and cocoa flavors. 432 charactersRaugupatis, Jul 18, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On-tap at The Bruery itself, 8oz.,
A: Pours pitch black with a light brown head, spots of lace.
S: Robust smell full of chocolate syrup, coffee and licorice.
T: Big flavours, heavy on the dark chocolate, molasses, licorice, anise and mocha. Bourbon barrels come in and add touch of vanilla, wood and cinnamon spice. Pretty much perfect for what an imperial stout should taste like.
M: Full-bodied, thick and viscous, but incredibly smooth and balanced. No heat from the alcohol is astonishing, but something I've come to expect from The Bruery's big beers. Dark Lord is the only beer I can recall having a comparably big mouthfeel.
D: Aside from Partridge in a Spice Tree this is my favourite beer ever from The Bruery, and it will actually be available for more than a weekend. I can't really find a fault with this beer. So easy to drink for its style, it should be illegal. It's hard to say $25 or $1/oz. for a bottle of beer is even a good deal, but for this one it's a steal. 985 charactersHalcyondays, Jul 18, 2009
