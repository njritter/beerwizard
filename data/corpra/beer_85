Appearance- A hazy off-orange with about a finger of snowy white head. Spotted lacing down the glass with a slight film on the glass. 
Smell- A super dose of citra hops hit my quick. As it aired a little, the grapefruit, mango, and pineapple kicked in. There is nice pine resin with a hint of malt- much less than the fruit bomb. 
Taste- Exactly what I got from the smell. The citrus and juicy tropical fruits definitely dominate. The hops have enough bite to remind you it's an IPA. 
Mouthfeel- Smooth feel with a medium carbonation. There was a sticky feel that did not seem to fit and a little more bitterness for the aftertaste. 
Overall- If you like citra hops, you will love this beer. My first beer from New England Brewing and I am extremely impressed. Great style and very drinkable IPA 845 charactersKdouble, May 12, 2017

I got a nice whiff of general citrus juice but no particular fruit aroma was too predominant.  Taste was very nice like fruit hard candy with a bit of piney hop in there as well.  A very clean beer did and was not as hazy as traditional NE style IPAs.  Very solid little brew here and the label art may be the best out there. 436 charactersJAStheAce, Apr 14, 2017

Pours yellowish, on the darker side with decent white head.  Great smell, with citrus dominating, but slight floral notes as well.  Taste is similar.  Nice citrus(more orange rind), but there is a floral presence as well.  Finishes slightly bitter, but nothing dank.  I'd call this a good example of the evolution of east coast IPA, in that it is starting to be more like Tree House with the big citrus notes, but the bitterness of something like Heady is still there. 529 charactersgibgink, Apr 10, 2017

4.68/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A standout among so many others that have began to crowd the style. This is OG, if you will (a recipe at least 4 years old as far as I know). Beautifully orange with a mild haze in appearance - like it just so happened to look that way, not trying to be hazy for the sake of in-vogue haziness. Aroma is balanced citrus hoppiness without the sweetness that accompanies many TH IPAs nor the yeastiness of Trillium. It's sort of a distilled representation of the style. Taste follows the nose but introduces a really wonderful creamy mouthfeel that I didn't expect from the appearance or aroma. It's oily in a good way and without being chewy. Finish is crisp with a mild bitterness that reminds you it's beer (a good thing in my book - if I want a fruit smoothie, I'll go to Jamba Juice). For my two cents, this is right up there with my other favorite 'local' citrus-based hoppy beers Julius and Fort Point, but marks out its own unique territory. Amazing stuff and really hoping they can this more often. 1,004 charactersJsukys, Mar 28, 2017

Friggin' cold waiting in line!
Pours a light orange with a 1" cream head that dissipates quite rapidly, not much lacing, slight haziness staying this side of the New England IPA trend
Smells of tropical fruits
Taste is where is really shines (and counts). More tropical fruits, slight hint of pine, typical New England Brewing yeast or malt back taste, which is good...mmm, great balance
Slight tingle on the tongue that lingers, a good creaminess that remains as well
Overall a fantastic IPA, up there with the big boys. More balanced than the current juice trend 651 charactersmusicsherlock, Mar 24, 2017

Aroma was a very wonderful display of the citra hops! Got all the usual players, orange/tangerine, mango, sweetened pineapple, grapefruit. Very pleasing aroma! 
Taste was thankfully close to the aroma with a little bit of malt/pine to even it out. The taste had a bit more balance than the heavy tropical/citrus nose.
Mouthfeel was pretty smooth and sessionable.
Overall, I have to say that this easily ranks up there with the other great NE IPAs that are more popular. Wish they canned this stuff for easier access, but it was well worth the wait and effort! Recommended! 673 charactersraspy22, Mar 04, 2017

4.26/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 32 oz growler filled at the brewery.
Pours a hazy honey orange color with a healthy finger of effervescent head. The head is pure snow white, and sticks around for a while before finally setting into a thin film that covers the beer like a sheet. Leaves a few random splotches of lace as it dissipates.
The aroma pretty much teabags your face with citra hops. Loads of mango and candied pineapple up front, followed by a healthy wave of orange rind and grapefruit. The back end is piney and earthy, with a subtle dankness. No malt detected. Just hops out the butt.
The taste follows the nose. Lots of sweet, juicy pineapple as well as some orange and mango. There's a nice hop bite and restrained bitterness, before the sweet malt comes through on the back end.
The feel is medium bodied with somewhat lively carbonation. Very smooth, with some loitering bitterness. A bit sticky. Drinks more like a DIPA, to be honest.
Overall, a fantastic IPA that does a wonderful job showcasing the citra hop. I'm well aware of the hype surrounding this beer. Is it overhyped? Absolutely. Does NEBCO make better beers? In my opinion, they do. But this one is still great and definitely worth seeking out. 1,210 charactersScaryEd, Feb 15, 2017

I love em too but this is right there. It's not sweet or floral - doesn't have that sugary yeast taste of others in the category. This is pony and resinous on the backend. It's almost metallic tasting. No one makes an IPA exactly like this. NEBCo carved our their little piece of the pie with this one. There's nothing better. Different and equally good . . . sure. Not better. 469 charactersdms, Dec 24, 2016

l 2f head with lacing and ring, good retention. beer is a semi hazy copper 
S Citra is always more tropical than citrus to me. I get pineapple and mango first, then orange and grapefruit. 
T fruit bomb for sure with pineapple and grapefruit leading the way, with some orange as well.  fairly bitter piney and dank finish. 
F light to medium body, light to medium carbonation, very good construction, bitterness runs away a bit at end 
O It's very good and everyone likes what they like, but I sense maybe an amount of overhype. I'm not sure what makes this superelite beyond the level of Kane's Hop Lab Citra, for example. 662 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jul 03, 2016

A - Honey yellow, steady carbonation piles upward into thick white, tight knit cap. Pillowy lacing
clings to the inside of the glass.
S - Orange reduction, unsulfured dried pineapple, tangerine, a sweet maltiness in the background. Wonderful display of late addition hops, Citra on delightful display.
T - Tropical fruit forward, a semisweet start, then creeping bitterness makes its way across the palate. a base of lite malts gently supports this hop centric offering.
M - A bit slick on the palate, initial rollout is right down the center of the tongue. A quick transition offers a bitter kiss. The finish is quite long. 
O - Thoughtfully crafted, this is an exercise in tropical hops, not an Evergreen to be had in this offering.

Offers a great, flowery lemon aroma on the nose, creating an enjoyable fruitiness from the get go. While there is not so much going on apart from the profound lemon, its multi layered richness actually convinces on its own. Truly refreshing, with a range between juicy to being crisp - very intriguing.
Has a medium, soft mouthfeel, showcasing the beers pungent citrus greatness in a very mellowed, enjoyable fashion, while revealing enough hop oomph at the same time.
Offers a citrus crispness right from the beginning, soothed by crackery malts and a fluffy aqueous quality. The malts turn a tad sweeter right before the swallow, which is neccessary to balance the fast evolving citraic bitterness, which remains utmost silk on the palate. Finishes clean and soft, with a dry, citrus fruitiness cutting through, establishing a juicy, long lasting aftertaste.
Loved this, while I find it hard to describe, as this beer is entirely focussed on its citrus hoppiness, and that is said within few words. It is perfectly put together though, especially due to its smooth mouthfeel, equiping the citrus with a softness you wouldn't be able to get from biting into an actual citrus fruit, while everything else is there. A flowery quality adds to the complexity of the citrus, keeping it interesting on the palate, while preventing it from overpowering the palate by scaling up too much lime bitterness. 1,452 charactersaleigator, Jan 09, 2016

I would never wait in line for this like some BAs have done on a frequent basis. It's balanced, it leaves nice sticky lacing on the glass, and it offers a myriad of citrus notes (if that's your thing). All that said, there's nothing about this beer or the brewer that makes me say, "damn, I've never tasted that before." It's been done, and done better. I like your beer NEBCO, but it's not as elusive as you make it seem! 481 charactersTheIPAHunter, Nov 30, 2015

A= I would call the color of this beer orange.  Has a decent amount of haze and cloudiness with a fairly persistent white head.  The lacing clings to the glass.
S= Tons of big tropical fruit smells including pineapple, mango, and citrus scents including rind, zest and juice from grapefruit and orange.
T= Big dank hop flavors, tons of tropical thunder, juicy as can be.  Outstanding, was concerned I would be disappointed, I am not.
M= Medium body with moderate carbonation.  Refreshing.
O= I think it is probably worth the effort.  Hope the new facility makes it easier to obtain.  Great beer, meets the hype, glad I could get a growler. 722 charactersjhavs, Nov 24, 2015

It does not come out often, but when it does, you will have to wait in long lines obtain or get lucky at a bar before it kicks within 30 minutes haha. Look of the beer is a bright yellow, smell is of pure citra hops, taste is anywhere from grapefruit to lemon to lime and so on... Overall super refreshing and light; can't help but crush a few of these pints (if available). Worth seeking out in my opinion, cheers! 576 characterstregan_20, Sep 18, 2015

The aroma alone sets off fire alarms in my head, and is something you could smell clear across the room as soon as the growler cap came off. Citrus, some earthiness, peach, and lychee fruit. Pours a very nice light orange to med gold, but lacks stellar head. Taste is pure citra; lemongrass, light melon, peach, grapefruit rind. Highly quaffable. 384 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Jul 07, 2015

S: Grapefruit peel, orange juice and subtle tropical notes. 
T: Soft tropical fruit flavors up front with a late sticky citrus bite. Very juicy beer.
F: I have found slight variation in the feel of this beer. I have tasted it where the bitterness was subtle and other times where it was sharp and biting. This beer is at its best in the former in my opinion. The feel is still nice either way—the carb is always on point and it's always absurdly drinkable.
O: This is the beer that drives a lot of NEBCo's hype. It's not my personal favorite of their's, but I still love it. I also love that it's not always available; I think some of the character of this beer is how infrequent the releases are. It's a world-class IPA and worth the experience to chase it down. 849 charactersCayseyW, Jun 12, 2015

10 oz pour for an embarrassingly high price. All for a citra IPA the likes of which can be had easily from several other northeast breweries with a lot less hassle.
Not that its not great, but its not even the best IPA made by Nebco. 405 charactersSteveOOO, May 26, 2015
4.73/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75The Ordinary in New Haven delivered. Served slightly cool in a tulip glass. Comes out a lovely hazy golden color, but with minimal head or carbonation. I've had this before a few times and it's always the same case. 
Smell is super potent, like rubbing fresh Citra hops in your hand and taking a big whiff. Everything else takes a back seat (very back). 
Taste is just amazing IPA through and through. Pure Citra hop juice. Loaded with citrus rind, lemon, grapefruit, and a bitter (but not insanely so) herbalness. Cracker malts peek out every know and then.
The feel is what sends this beer over the top for me. It's really soft, delicate, and so damn light in the stomach. I had 3 at the Ordinary before the keg kicked. Will seek out again but it is not worth the 3 hour line at the brewery. 796 charactersBranfordBound, May 21, 2015

S - tropical floral hops. Smells so fresh and distinctly NEBCO. Slight orange and mild breadiness. Some juicy character. 
T - FRESH. The first word that comes to mind. Incredibly crisp and on point. Juicy grapefruit and orange. Crackery wheatiness. The balance in this beer is insane. Going into it, you can't expect to be blown away like you would a DIPA. That's not what this beer is about, it's about concocting the perfect single hop IPA. Hits all the right notes. Exhibits a slightly "hollow" flavor profile that floats flavor around the fringes, like the rings of Saturn, if you compare this beer to a planet. Pushes the flavor to heights you normally wouldn't see in a single IPA. Has a pointed dryness that sucks it all back into the core and ties the whole beer together. Well done. 
F - light, but full and infinitely refreshing. Something NEBCO does well. Silky smooth. 
O - the quintessential IPA. Nothing more to say other than a fantastically well-done offering from NEBCO. 1,095 charactersagreenman19, Apr 06, 2015
4.3/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Drank on tap at Plan B Burger Bar, Glastonbury, CT
Served in a pint glass
The beer poured a ridiculously cloudy, deep yellow ochre. I have never seen a beer that more closely resembled orange juice. The liquid was topped by a small, frothy, off-white crown that quickly dropped to a thin ringlet. Drops of lacing trickled along the glass.
Fragrant citrus and tropical fruit notes came through strong in the aroma. Candied orange peel was most apparent. Really crisp and bright. Super juicy. Loads of tangerine. Good dose of passionfruit and mango. A fairly intense, weed-like quality was present as well.
The flavor profile was definitely more pithy and bitter than the nose. Grapefruit dominated. Ruby red grapefruit came to mind. Slightly sweet. Loads of orange peel. Touch of tropical fruitiness. Mango was noticeable. The beer finished with an intensely bitter, white grapefruit like pithiness that lingered long after each sip.
The mouthfeel was lighter bodied for the style but quite creamy. Frothy and fluffy on the palate. The liquid contained a fine yet zippy effervescence.
Aside from this being the cloudiest IPA I have ever come across, Fuzzy Baby Ducks did not strike me as being all that unique or memorable. Although this is definitely a well crafted beer, I doubt that I would go to great lengths to procure it again. 1,338 charactersDamian, Apr 04, 2015

I am grateful that I did not have to stand in line for two hours for a growler fill of this beer. 
Fuzzy Baby Ducks looks great and smells great, but fails to deliver on flavor. It is a pretty basic and straightforward Citra IPA that drinks easy and finishes with more of a west coast bitter than a clean east coast ending. 
Back in the day, I could see how the locals saw this as an amazing beer, but in the current state of craft beer, you could find shelf beers that surpass this brew. 552 charactersrodmanfor3, Feb 28, 2015

4.47/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Aroma - A punch of citra hops to the face—orange, grapefruit and pineapple most notable in the nose, but also some slight notes of acetic/funk presumedly from the yeast.
Appearance - Hazy yellow/straw color with a loose white head.  Impresive from a growler!
Flavor - Palette is full of juicy orange and tropical fruit notes. Surprisingly low bitterness, no lingering sweetness and occasional appearances of a wheat or buttery malts.
Mouthfeel - Medium-low bodied with a bit of an effervescence.  Some hop bitterness with no lingering astringency.
Overall - A citra hophead’s dream come true, this unapologetic IPA has some other subtle nuances that make it unique. 673 charactersadnauseam007, Feb 24, 2015

Smell: huge amounts of fruitiness. ranging from passionfruit to grapefruit and orange. quite a bit of resinous bitterness too. slight grainy/malty sweetness.
Taste: opens up with juicy and fruity notes. passionfruit, mango and citrus. after the juicy start things become a bit more resinous and almost spicy to piney. after all the hops a very slight bready malt comes through. no crystal-like sweetness, just a light sweetness to balance all the hops.
Mouthfeel: lighter and refreshing. lingering bitter and hop resin. strong drinkability.
Overall: clearly an extremely well done IPA. amazing range of taste from the Citra, I wouldn't have guessed that this was a single hop. Easily a top tier IPA but there are others out there that I would prefer to this and are easier to get. 980 charactersSportsandJorts, Dec 12, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -0.4%Drank from a 10 day old growler picked up on a trade in CT this past weekend (Thanks Brian!).  This is a really great IPA.  Amazing fruity/ floral aroma and wonderfully balanced, fruity, hoppy taste.  I think it just loses a little (just a tad) on the finish.   Very wonderful beer, but maybe not quite worth it for how hard it is to obain.  I actually like Gandhi Bot a little better.  (note, I have been drinking Dinner and Treehouse Haze the past few days, so my palette has some major competition).  Definitely worth drinking if you can get it and maybe the best 6.2% abv IPA I have had. 591 charactersChrisInBaltimore, Dec 10, 2014

A- Cloudy, hazy, misty- you get the idea- straw yellow-orange body. Again, very cloudy. Looks like a Hill Farmstead IPA. Appropriately sized two finger white head with good retention time and plenty of lacing. Looks good. [4.5]
S- This beer has an extremely impressive nose. Intense passion fruit, grapefruit and oranges- the unmistakable aroma of Citra which seems to be overdone in brewing these days yet the Citra shines so well here. Just enough grainy pale malt sweetness to balance out the resinous nature of the hops. Ridiculously lush, fresh and juicy. [5]
F- Grapefruit, passion fruit, mango. Tastes juicy and rich. The pale malt stands out of the way the entire time, just enough to keep the hops from being overwhelming. A very nice citrusy and grassy bitterness on the backend that really cleans up the palate and sticks around for a while. This is really tasty. [4.5]
M- Medium bodied, soft, perfectly carbonated, smooth and incredibly crushable. The grassy bitterness provides a great balance without getting in the way of drinking this beer. This is very drinkable, no doubt about that. [4.5]
O- One of the best Citra IPAs I've ever had. Overall in terms of IPAs I definitely have a preference for Tree House Julius, especially since FBD has been such a pain to get. But this is definitely worth seeking out. One of these days I'll be able to do this side-by-side with fresh pseudoSue, a beer that this one reminds me of. [4.5]

4.5/5  rDev -0.4%It's a fantastic beer.  Can't give it the full 5 because there are a few beers I prefer slightly more ( THB C-9/Julius, Nebco Ten-er #11).  Only had to wait ~75 minutes!  Love me some citra hops.
On second taste, I had to adjust my rating down.  The reason is I do not care for much malt flavor, and there's some malt action going down on my tongue that kind of distracts me from the rest of the flavorbomb. 408 charactersBroMcChuggington, Nov 26, 2014

A: Pours a hazy yellow with a thin (1/4") white head which fades to a cap and leaves some spotty lace.
N: Floral and fruity tropical and citrus (grapefruit and orange), faint peaches.
T: Juicy tropical fruits and citrus overtones. Well balanced.
M: Moderate body and medium carbonation (growler). Finishes sticky and dare I say soft and fuzzy.

Any worries that the growler didn't travel well are dissolved by the pour. Pours a hazy, almost opaque orange, with a 3 inch head. Not much lacing in the glass.
Smells like bright citrus flavors (orange + grapefruit, mainly) with some underlying cattiness.
The taste is pretty similar. This tastes pretty similar to most Citra-hopped beers, but escapes most of the pitfalls of single hopped Citra beers. There is a sort of underlying cattiness that I find hard to describe (I will not describe it as cat pee, because I have never drank cat pee). It's more of an earthy cattiness, or something. As the beer warms, the citrus flavors become even brighter- juicy oranges and grapefruits, a little bit of pineapple. The bitterness is mild, but it lingers in your mouth during the whole session. This one gets better the more you drink of it.
Crisp, but slightly sticky mouthfeel. This beer coats your mouth and sticks around. Low carbonation. Very drinkable. The body is light, but almost fluffy in a way. The body and mouthfeel of this beer is possibly it's biggest strength, and it's nearly perfect. At 6%, this is a relatively low ABV IPA- it drinks so easy, with such huge flavor.
This is, unsurprisingly, a great IPA. The dirty cattiness is more noticeable before the beer warms up a bit, and detracts slightly, keeping it from being the perfect IPA. That being said, despite that, this is one hell of a beer. 1,503 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 24, 2014

Pours a cloudy, hazy, golden color. Fluffy white head leaves thick rings behind
Smell is of a Citra esque cat pee and tropical fruits.
Taste is bitter with that sharp Citra taste (I don't even know if Citra is used, but it sure seems like it to me) followed by some exoctic tropical fruits. Very dank.
It is a relatively dry IPA. It coats the mouth and leaves you wanting more!

Gorgeous cloudy apricot pour (there is nothing like the look of an unfiltered IPA), generous two finger Navajo white head that recedes to a nice cap with lacing abound in the Lawson's tulip. Great start.
Aroma is quite juicy and hop forward. My nose picks up clementines and peaches with a nice sweetness about it that faintly resembles a freshly baked cinnamon bun with icing.
Flavors are very juicy as well, with a big pleasant hop blast to the palate without ever becoming overbearing, the flavors linger and you don't want them to go away. As it warms it becomes notably more peachy, and the alcohol is masterfully hidden with just the right abv for the hops to play center stage in the flavor zone.
This is an excellent example of an East Coast style that has been popularized over the last couple of years, and delivers everything I love about a cloudy unfiltered IPA. Outstanding use of the Citra hop, tremendous aroma,taste and mouthfeel, Fuzzy Baby Ducks is a Grand Slam and comes highly recommended by Hendry. 1,220 charactersHendry, Apr 19, 2014

Similar in color to Gandhi Bot with a hazy red/orange color and one inch white head. The taste is big on the grapefruit and not much else, maybe some orange or tropical fruit as well, but mainly grapefruit. Motuhfeel is great on this with juicy hops up front and a smooth, almost creamy finish.   Overall, this was more than worth it to track down and it easily deserves its perfect score on BA. 470 charactersCTbrew32, Apr 19, 2014

A- A massive plume of white foam sits atop a hazy orange/hay-colored body. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass.
S- The aroma is an initial burst of tropical fruit, especially passion fruit and mango, along with pineapple, followed by lots of citrus. Tangerine and lemon mainly, with some grapefruit as well. Some pine and bready/caramelly malt are also detected. A wonderful aroma!
T- The flavor opens with a lot of the tropical fruit, but that is ushered away by moderately bitter citrus and pine, and then finishes with clean, crisp cracker-like bready malt. This is very well balanced, but I wish the flavors melded a bit more rather than having such a clear cut progression from one to the next. It should be noted that this growler was over 2-weeks old, so it may have suffered slightly from that.
M- The mouth feel is medium, with not much carbonation. Crisp and clean.
O- This may have been negatively effected by the 2+ weeks it spent in the growler, but if so then this beer is truly world class! Some minor flaws such as less of the hop flavors and carbonation can likely be linked to that. Still an outstanding beer! 1,166 charactersSadMachine, Feb 15, 2014

I'm not sure what to say about this brew; all I want to do is gush. It looks and smells beautiful. The flavor is centered around the hops but remains completely balanced. This is without a doubt the best and most drinkable IPA I have ever had. It has, in many ways, ruined me, because I think about it constantly and wish I had more, but this is the only bad thing to say about it.
The best my kitchen has ever smelled was when I was rinsing the growlers.
If you hear about an appearance by the Ducks you should be sprinting to NEBCo. 613 charactersprinceofthepoint, Jan 08, 2014

on tap at coalouse in Stamford, ct. Poured into pils glass. Murky Orange with a bit of white head and tons of sticky lacing. Cant tell you how much I love a murky beer...
Huuuge pine and citrus fruit hop aromas...crisp malty notes as well. Taste is just domination of hops..lots of lemony citrus and a bit of sweet can do hop up front but finishes with a big bitter pine. Really nice balance...some slight biscuit flavor works really well. So much flavor its insane. The mouthfeel is a bit bitter but still amazing. Overall this truly is a fantastic IPA...one of the best I've ever had. im not usually a bitter ipa guy but this just works so well...I'm already back on the hunt for this again. 738 charactersDrinkSlurm, Dec 31, 2013

Head goes away quickly. It smells amazing, even as I'm pouring it. Very bright citus nose, smells very sweet, too. Grapefruit, orange, some tropical fruits, all the good stuff. Taste follows the nose. So much citra goodness and just a tad bitter to offset some original sweetness upfront. Some floral character in there, as well. Lightly carbonated and thin, goes down easy. Leaves a slight bitter citrus on the tongue after that is just great. This is a very good beer. Reminiscent of some great pale ales. Zombie dust, psuedosue. I could drink a lot more of this. 666 charactersMikeypnh, Dec 27, 2013

A - Vibrant orange-reddish hazy body with a couple finger of off-white head. Drops absolutely enormous amounts of lacing all over the glass behind it - the greatest lacing I've ever seen from a beer, bar none.
S - Pine is the first thing that hits the nose, followed by tropical fruit: guava, mango, stonefruit. Bitter orange and lemon as it opens up. Little bits of weed/cat pee. Biscuity malt very noticeable in nose - this is different than prior batch. Pretty unbelievably amazing.
T - Piney and resiny, not normally something I get from Citra. Middle of the flavor is grapefruit, followed by a wonderful fading out of amazing tropical fruit, including a lot of passionfruit and mango. Delicious. Mouth feels "fuzzy" - I imagine this is the genesis of the name. Again, very noticeable biscuity malt. Almost tastes like it has a blonde ale behind it rather than a pale base, there's a lot of malt flavor but not thick or sweet, just flavor.
M - Light and thinner than I'd like. Plenty carbonated. Incredibly crooshable. No cloying sweetness or ashy bitterness left behind, just happiness. Could probably drink a gallon and a half of this in a night easily, and that's not an exaggeration.
O - The King Stay The King. 1,301 charactersmushrooms, Dec 24, 2013

4.49/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5To me, this is the ever-elusive NEBCo. offering. Gandhi is great, but it's available relatively regularly. This is the beer that had me thinking NEBCo. could give Hill a run for their money, based on the reviews anyway. As such, I and many others opted to wait for around an hour for a portion of their final keg this December. At $10/2L growler, they've already got Hill beat by far. I must admit I come into this review with Susan in mind, which is my second highest review (4.99) and comes in at $16/2L. I judge this a fair comparison considering their close proximity in ratings and geography.
A: Pale yellow/orange, filtered. Very nice.
S: Hoppy & citrusy, as expected. Lives up to the hype and then some.
T: And the pièce de résistance. Much more bitter than I had expected, not too much so however. The citrus for me comes after the upfront bitterness that is floral and not citrusy. The citrus is significant yet more subdued than I had expected. Not quite as citrus-forward or balanced as Susan. However, still spectacular.
M: Spot-on for an AIPA. 
O: Well, although I must admit I'd take Susan over Fuzzy here, this brew is still undoubtedly among if not ahead of NEBCo and Connecticut's best. And, for that alone, they should be immensely proud. I never thought I'd see Hill-esque lines for beer in my home state but I sure enough did. And it was largely because of this beer. If you can get your hands on it, seize the opportunity. Going to savor the 2L I have. 1,480 charactersBTVflatlander, Dec 24, 2013

The smell of the Citra knocks me out! Fantastic. 
The flavor , much like the smell is incredibly citrusy , grapefruit rind, lemony, grassy with just enough malt for the hops to launch off. I don't want to put the glass down.... I want to inhale whenever I'm not sipping. Mouthfeel medium-low , kind of exactly right with perfect carbonation.
Drinkability is off the charts. When this went on tap at my local place, I was there three nights in a row until it kicked.
They now refer to me as the Fuzzy Baby Duck Guy.

Pours a very hazy soap-amber color with a humble topper of white foam. It almost looks a little soapy. However, it does look damn refreshing! 
I smell pitted fruits, citrus, and floral hops. Fresh apricot, dried mango, tangerine, and guava. All of this touched by a rather delicate ale yeast that sweetens the aroma with the smell of oily nut flesh. Malts are candid and quite pale. Some sugar cookie mixed in here. Delectable. 
Nice acidic twang of hoppy bitterness upfront, but it cleans up quick and finishes with tropical fruits and attenuated citrus. Guava, tangerine, lemon zest, and papaya make up the fruitiness. Floral notes bounce around. Much drier than the aroma would let on. Very clean and zippy. Absolutely refreshing, too. Super-smooth body accented by some sparkling side-mouth effervescence. Sugar cookie from the nose turned into wine cracker in the flavor. Very pale malts with very little wort sugar to spare. Implied sweetness comes from the fruity hops. Dreamably drinkable. A one-after-another kind of beer. 
This is a fantastic IPA. So happy to have been gifted a full growler of this stuff to enjoy during a trying work week. Cheers! 1,207 charactersthecheapies, Feb 08, 2013

What an amazing nose! Tons of hops, pine, floral, and citrus. The pine and woodnotes are tremendous with grass and possibly peaches, and maybe even apricot.
The flavor is equally awesome with puckering and tangy hops resembling sweet citrus, as well as fresh cut wood with more pine and grass. There is actually a hint of faint bready malt here as well. 
Lighter to medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation and a just plain awesome sticky, pungent, hoppy finish.

4.45/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Being an IPA addict and after having read the reviews I drove about an hour to the brewery and picked up a few growlers. Shocked and impressed that NEBco fills a 64oz growler of this stuff for $10. Bravo. And feel free to charge me $15-$18 next time.
Bullet points:
This beer has one of the best smells of any of the ipa's i've tried.
It looks awesome too - golden with lacy, white head.
Tastes good, light and refreshing... and with a mid range abv, it's close to a sessionable beer. It's a little more bitter than I would like, but balanced as other reviewers have said.
Final Judgement:
Fuzzy Baby Ducks is a great IPA. You'd be a quack not to try it if given the chance, but don't "fly" too far south or north to get some... instead buy some of their canned DIPA (Gahndi Bot) or do a trade. It's as good or better. And we can always hope they can or bottle this stuff because the label would be top 10. 912 charactersdrinker36, Feb 03, 2013

4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A very cloudy weak tea colored IPA with a decent white fuzz on top (quite appropriately) and generous lacing to follow. The aroma brings intense citrus, grapefruit, orange, lemon, whatever, it’s there in spades almost to a sweet tart conclusion but it includes a little bready grain to give a touch of balance perhaps. I love it. The flavor is “grab your tongue”, Hop Stoopid bitter with the continued hop theme along with a grainy suggestion. This stuff is near mid-bodied but the tiny, brisk carbonation gives it a very lively, summer refreshment feel. It’s pretty intense and the flavor settles into a fruit syrup bite that still carries the grain goodness underneath the hop attack. Man I hope NEB sticks with this one. Sea Hag is a pleasant IPA that I’ll always like, but this moves up there with Stowaway as one of my favorite new IPA’s! Bravo Rob! 866 charactersDurge, Sep 12, 2012

Pumped to try this one after destroying back at the gym and a nice 2 mile 6 min 30 sec average run. Prepping for a backyard Olympics competition with oldcrustacean (3 rounds 5 minutes a piece in the ring, 3 tennis sets, bench/dead lift/squat competition). I had a nice chat with Rob the NEBC owner while enjoying this one. They are really killing it. Hazy orange body with a nice head and sticky lacing that hangs around. The smell is citrusy tropical hops. This beer is bitter but the tropical notes balance it out beautifully. Goes down so smooth... I thought it had a much lower ABV. Between this beer, the new sea hag formula, galaxy, ghandi bot, imperial stout trooper, and gold stock, this is one of my top breweries. 756 charactersDNICE555, Aug 01, 2012
4.7/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Could this be one of the best brews ever? Had tons of the initial release, and couldn't wait for it to be brewed again. Had this on tap at New York Pizza in Plainfield. Brought to me in a pint glass, straight from the keg. Here we go. 
Appearance: Fuzzy Baby Ducks arrives to the table a Cloudy, almost dull, watered down orange juice color. About a finger of dense bright white foam capped this beer off. Awesome head retention. Plenty of thick lace was left sticking to the glass throughout the whole experience. 
Smell: Heavy hops up front, and plenty of them. Faint woody notes. Citrus and pine. Sweet malt is there, but is beaten down by the hops. Very pleasant nose. My discription just doesn't do it justice.
Taste: Hops definitely rule this beer! Citrus fruit and pine really shine in this brew. Sweet , somewhat grainy malt background tries to stand up to the juicy hops, but again the hops rule. Bitter hop bit and dry finish. Can't get enough of this brew!
Mouthfeel: Dry , super slick mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on. 
Overall: NEBCO hits it out of the park again. Awesome drinkability, and great hop flavor. 1,127 charactersjaxon53, Jul 22, 2012

4.15/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a gorwler into a plain tumbler pint glass at Durge's.
A: Poured a very hazy, bright yellow color with a two-finger head of frothy, white foam which hung around for most of the brew, leaving some decent lacing.
S: Lots of complex, fruity and funky hop resins; grapefruit rind, a little catty, lemograss and herbal with flashes of peppery, skunk sweat.
T: Big, brash and citrusy palate wrecked by an onslaught of highly acidic hop resins. Loads of sweet, bright, lemony flavors leap forward with very herbal and bitter hop flavors. A slight malt sweetness tries to cut the palate but this brew washes back with a slightly boozy, sharp and fresh hop whallop.
M: Medium-full bodied IPA with lots of sticky hop resins, although the almost wheat-cracker malts keep things crisp and in somewhat of a balance.
O: The 6.2% ABV is not necessarily a killer but the IBUs will surely inhibit your palate for a while. Calling Fuzzy Baby Ducks "one-dimensional" almost sounds like an insult, but I'll say it with the best intentions. Like they took Alpha Weizen and bred it with Sea Hag, this IPA is the bright, crushing IPA for summer that citrusy hopheads are longing for. 1,176 charactersGambrinus1184, Jul 01, 2012
4.6/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5another winner from NEBCO.
I bought a few growlers, blowing through my last one.
This has a long-lasting head and a nice orangey color. Great sticky lacing. The smell is tropical, fruity, delicious. This beer is light in flavor, and by that I mean the hops are sweet and not sharp or abrasive. Citra really is a wonder-hop... this reminds me of a half-strength Citra from KRBC. And that's a very high compliment, as that's my top-rated beer. Not much malt base but that's fine with me as the hops are so delicious.
6.2% seems just about right for this one. A joy to drink. 
This one goes down too easily. I really really really like it, and hope NEBCO moves this one into regular rotation. One of the more delightful beers I've encountered as of late. 755 charactersShogoKawada, Jul 01, 2012
4.41/5  rDev -2.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at The Winchester, right across the street from NEBCO in the presence of some awesome BA's. Standard pour into a pint glass. Review coming from some notes I took on my phone...hey, ticks a tick!
A - Bright orange hazy body. Small off white head. Not super impressive. 
S - Strong citra presence. Orange juice, tropical fruit, grapefruit, lemon and some lightly dank onion. Super juicy fruits with a touch of bready malts. 
T - The fruit is all over the place. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemons and limes, papaya, etc. Theres a bit of a grassy and danky onion presence. This is all smoothed out on the finish by some biscuity malt. Finishes dry and bitter with lasting citrus juice flavors. Really refreshing with tons of citrus hop flavors, drinks way too easily. Medium mouth feel. 
O - I missed my chance of getting a growler of this, so I was stoked to get to try this on tap. Amazing beer that really highlights the citra hop variety. I hope this gets brewed again next year! 986 charactersdavey101, Jul 01, 2012

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at Prime 16 in New Haven.
Poured a vibrant yellow, just an awesome, perfect color for an IPA. Slightly hazy with a 1 finger white head. Really good lacing on this beer all the way through til the end. 
What a treat for the nose! Big citrus aroma, orange comes out big here. Didn't focus on smell too much because I was too excited for the taste.
Perfection. Crisp, clean, refreshing, this is what every IPA should taste like. Big citrus up front (much like heady) grapefruits and orange dominate the taste but the malts are there as well. The bitterness factor is perfect! Not too bitter but just enough of a hop bite that an IPA should have. 
Citra hops &gt; anything, wish I could have given the taste a 6.
Mouthfeel is right in line with the best of them. Most drinkable beer I've ever had, could easily have 4-5 glasses of this on a nice summer day. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, perfect for an IPA. 
Overall NEBCO really proved how great their brewers are with this beer. Fuzzy Baby Ducks can go toe to toe with any IPA in the world and there will be few, if any, that are better. Loved every second of drinking this and we can only hope it is brewed again next year. Call me bias, a local front runner, whatever you want, but this is just perfection in a glass. 1,294 charactersPete27lax, Jun 29, 2012
4.7/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Just had this beer on cask from a local bar.
A- It's awesome. The beer is golden yellow can't even see through the other side. Frothy white head that basically never goes away.
S- The smell is awesome, hops, grapefruit more than anything. Gives you an idea of whats to come.
T- Taste is fantastic, grapefruit takes over here. I think the cask makes some of the malts stick out a bit more as well unless thats just how this beer is. I've never had it any other way than today, from a cask.
M- Feel is perfect. Very drinkable but still holds a nice body to it.
Overall, this beer is fantastic. All of the great elements of an IPA are there. I only wish i could find this in a bottle or regular tap so i can compare it to itself on cask. 739 charactersTaylor8189, Jun 29, 2012

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I dont review many beer but this one I had to. This is a non biased opinion even though they are my favorite brewery and easily the best in CT, if not New England. I was also the first person to receive a growler of this!(or so I was told, thought that was cool)
The look of this beer is just a glowing yellow that is mouthwatering.
The smell is pure citra. From grapefruit to lemon, grass, and lime its perfect
The taste is worth saying its the best citra IPA ive had. I run a liquor store and couldn't resist sampling this to customers out of my growler who were worthy of having this. It is so refreshing and light, but full bodied and perfect at the same time. I could drink this beer in the middle of winter, or on the hottest day of the year, which happened to be the day I got it.
Overall I wish this beer was bottled and year round, but I know they cant get the citra hops year round because of the small size of the brewery. Although this will be an awesome treat once a year.
 NEBCO just does things with hops/beer i'll never understand and frankly dont care to as long as they keep doing it. I would put this beer up against any across the country anyday. a 10 out of 10 to me, love everything NEBCO does, please dont ever change.

4.42/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Got my growler filled today at the brewery. Day two of the beer's existence. 
A - It pours a very murky yellow/orange. Very little head, as just a few bubbles rise to the surface. 
S - Smells great. A ton of hoppy citrus aromas. Just a truly great smelling IPA.
T - Taste very much follows the smell. Lots of citrus flavors, hop bitterness. The bitterness is really at a nice level, not too over the top, but just right and it lasts a while.
M - A little on the thin side. Also, it lacks a bit in the carbonation department.
O - Love this IPA. Sounds like it is only going to be brewed once a year, which is too bad. Would love to see this available more often. Would also be great if this was bottled. 707 characterspjs234, Jun 23, 2012

4.85/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 564oz growler into Duvel tulip. Filled this afternoon; beer was released yesterday.
Appearance: Free pour yields a 2 inch fluffy white head that dissipates slowly leaving thick webs of lacing. Pours an opaque light orange that seems to glow yellow. I love this look in an IPA; when I see a picture online of an opaque, nectary IPA like this, I want it to be in a glass in front of me, immediately.
Smell: Citra in all its glory. The aroma of this beer promises an answer as to why beer geeks lust after Citra hop-forward beer. Powerful citrus (somewhere between lime and orange), highlighted by numerous tropical fruit notes with some weed/onion underneath. Biscuit backdrop from the malt provides less balance than mild counterpoint to the huge hop aroma; more of a bonus than anything else.
Pushing a 5.0. Stays powerful and good throughout. 
Taste: Straightforward and delicious: citrusy, fruity hops up front quickly deepening with some pungent weed/onion influence, leading to a hit of healthy bitterness that's complemented by a slight toasty malt element. Gets really succulent and resinous, then finishes dry, with a hop aftertaste that changes as it lasts (melon, mysterious tropical fruits, the smell of greenhouses). 
With time, the hop flavors open up even further. Citrus remains strong, and the mild weed/onion (more weed) undertone is a constant as well, but a wide range of unexpected and good fruity hop flavors emerge as the beer warms. This beer gives a full display of the potential of Citra hops. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Slightly juicy, but more succulent. Perfect bitterness (above average without being overdone; keeps things crisp). Moderate carbonation. Perfectly dry (solid dryness, but not bone dry). 
Overall: This is just a perfect IPA. I'm tempted to make it my first all 5 beer (the aroma could be slightly more complex and pungent, and the look could have a bit better lacing).
If I could forgo drinking every other beer and just have a pint (or two, or more) of this each day for the rest of this record-breakingly hot summer, I would. It is excellent, and exactly what I want to drink in hot weather.
Note, while this review may sound like drunken exuberance, I have only had 1 glass... however, it will be a serious exercise in willpower not to kill the whole growler tonight. 2,322 charactersPahn, Jun 22, 2012
4.91/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A-Pours a soupy peach-juice color. Off-white bubbles create a cool film atop the brew. Completely murky. Looks like some sort of fruit juice. Impressed by its complete lack of clarity.
S-Wow. One of the juiciest, fruitiest citrus noses I have ever laid schnoz to. Unbelievably ripe and juice-laden. Tropical fruits galore. Even some banana aroma. Thank you Citra hop. Smooth malt of bread and biscuit. Like a muffin with oranges in it.
T-Phenomenal. Like a deliciously bitter orange juice. Tons of grassiness loop around the intense citrus waves. Tropical fruitiness is deep and complex. Perfect amount of bitterness. Long lasting aftertaste. The hoppiness is impeccable. 
M-Ripe and juicy. Mellow carbonation. Bitterness that refuses to leave. The body is full and nearly chewy. Grapefruit juice feel. The body is only outdone by the taste.
O/D-This could be the best by NEBCO so far. A lot like Galaxy Pale but the differences between the Galaxy hop and the Citra hop are clearly defined. NEBCO absolutely kills hoppy beers. This is one of the best non-imperial IPAs I have ever had. Hell, its up there with some of the best imperials I have had too. The Citra hop has been mastered here. I can't stop giving NEBCO's beers super-high reviews because their beers are consistently out of this world. 1,303 charactersVelvetExtract, Jun 22, 2012

S: Wonderful juicy, tropical aroma I've come to expect with Citra hops. Loads of citrus fruits, pineapple, and mangos. Sweet sweet nectar.
T: Outstading! Very tropical and citrusy, with a slight bitterness, gets better with every sip. Fruity and refreshing.
M: Very light, with minimal carbonation.

4.59/5  rDev +1.5%look: 1.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at the brewery, poured into a NEBCO pint glass. 
A: Cloudy, clearly unfiltered pale orange body with a significant amount of hop particulates floating around beneath a 1/2" head of fine tan foam that quickly fades into oblivion. Not exactly pretty. Matt claimed that this particular log was filled from the bottom of the brite tank and was therefore not a fair representation of how the beer typically looks, but I've got to review what's in my glass and what's in my glass is ugly. 
S: Who cares about appearance? This smells INCREDIBLE. Pure, heady Citra goodness. Fruity as hell (grapefruit, mango, grape) and terrifically resinous. If you love dank hops, you'll love this.
T: Follows the nose. Rich, delicious, powerful hoppiness. Fruity up front, oily and resinous in the middle, and cleanly bitter on the finish. Not a hint of malt, and yet somehow the hops don't get oppressively bitter. It's both drinkable and intense at the same time. Perfection.
M: Soft, frothy, medium-bodied. Perhaps a bit too airy, but really nice.
O: What a terrific beer! Obviously it helps to get it the day it was conditioned, but I expect it will remain a truly delicious hop bomb for a while. It reminded me of the awesome IPAs from Willibrew - hideous to behold, but magical to taste. I can't wait to go into a beer bar and tell the bartender "Give me a glass full of Fuzzy Baby Ducks, please." You should, too.
Cheers! 1,432 characterswoosterbill, Jun 21, 2012
