Appear: nicely orange haze half a fingers worth of head that was lacing pillowy 
Nose: Big juicy citrus bursting through as soon as you crack the can.  nicely mixes with some herbal dankness.  
Taste:  nice tropical citrusy goodness.  
Mouth: I honestly don't know that anyone else gets as lucious of a body as TH does out of their IPAs.  
Over: So I think this beer is in that excellent to very best arena but it's not the BEST IPA I've ever had. It doesn't mean it's not next level though. 572 charactersGumbo_gravy, May 07, 2017

Opaque orange appearance. 
A violent pour yielded a HUGE bright white head; thick, frothy tree-rung lace. 
Pine, fresh soap, grapefruit & mild cane sugar notes in the nose. 
Soft medium mouthfeel. 
Pine & faint soft apple flavors up front; watermelon jolly rancher and mild dry wheat notes on the finish. 
This is NOT my profile for the style. Nice mouthfeel at least, but I need some fruit notes in my IPA's. 463 charactersGuyFawkes, Apr 23, 2017

Appearance- A rather cloudy orange color with a fluffy two plus fingers of foamy white head. Does not appear as thick as some other TH beers I have tried. 
Smell- More of a dominant pineapple and grapefruit than anything else. Again not as strong as other TH beers.
Taste- A sweet tropical fruit taste with very little hops. Some pine resin in it that I am not accustomed to with TH. The taste was still extremely drinkable and the finish had me wanting more. No alcohol in the taste. It bridges the gap between fruity and piney nicely. 
Mouthfeel- A soft feel with little carbonation and smooth all the way through. 
Overall- I really enjoyed taking my time with the brew. The flavors seemed much more diverse as I let it breathe. Very solid from start to finish with less fruit juiciness than most TH brews. I was a believer by the end of the beer wanting more. 926 charactersKdouble, Apr 21, 2017

4.62/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A really top notch offering from Tree House!  This beer stands out from other Tree House IPAs in that it's more subtle on the fruit flavors and lighter on the palate.  It's less juicy than Julius, less piney than Green, but more resiny than Tree House pale ales (i.e. Lights On), and is delicately bitter with hints of grapefruit and vinous characteristics at the end from the Nelson hops.  This is a beer that's about balance-- it shows off the features that make Tree House IPAs great without any particular feature being overwhelming (fruitiness, bitterness, resin, etc.)-- the result is an amazingly drinkable IPA that is eminently enjoyable on a warm spring day! 667 charactersjonibeer, Apr 18, 2017

4.63/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bonus points to this beer for having an adorable backstory. That aside, this beer pours beautifully and rocks the classic treehouse appearance.  Full, almost milky yellow-orange look. Taste and smell are a bit subtler relative to some of the treehouse staples, but it is still amazingly delicious. Slighty citrusy and tropical, it leaves an addictive aftertaste that sits on the palate.
P.S. Treehouse beers make for some tasty burps, if you're into that kind of thing 469 charactersRoofpizza, Apr 17, 2017

T: Tastes of blueberry, peach,  plum , light mango and gentle orange pith.  Everything about this beer is smooth and well rounded.  It is not overbittered and not grassy.  It has the signature treehouse yeast with doughy phenols and green tastes.  What more can you ask for.  Delicious

I remember having this last year and I was really big into nelson hop stuff.  I loved this beer then but now not as much.   that's not too say anything bad about this beer cause it is very good.  I feel like I enjoy some of their other offerings more.  overall another top notch ipa from treehouse.   all their beers get better as they get warmer and this is no exception.  only once a year makes this beer ectra special. 910 characterszshaft, Oct 28, 2016

4.05/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I bought these upon release, traded a bunch and just now decided to have one of the two I had left. I'm glad I did...
L: typical NE IPA/Tree House, a cloudy orange. I'm an avid home brewer and have yet to use a yeast that ends up like this. I'm convinced they use flour or something to cloud their beer.
S: pineapple, some bread yeast. Typical Tree House
T: not as much of a "fruit bomb" as their other beers. There's a perceived sweetness/tropical fruitiness, but some background bitterness too. There's a hint of pine and acidity. It's different from many of the other TH offerings, but not so different that it's easily differentiated from their other beers. I'd say this is along the lines of Very Green, though a little more refined. It is more drinkable in that I could have a few and not get too tired of the taste (unlike Julius). I liked it, but was hoping for something more different given the occasion for which it was brewed.
F: typical Tree House... soft and fluffy. What in the world do they add to their water to make the beer feel like that?
O: A sold beer, not the perfect 100 that it's been given (so far). I think many tasters are subjective given the difficulty and expense of obtaining the beer. In Perpetuity is in the category of American IPA, and there are many others that are a perfect 100. 1,322 charactersGeeL, Oct 26, 2016

I got ahold of a can of this rare release and it tastes almost as good as Julius. Great orange juice color and haze. Lots of lacing. Smells like oranges and maybe a little guava. Tastes more of guava with orange and a bitter grapefruit backend. Very creamy mouthfeel that makes you drink it a little faster than you would have liked. This beer is worth savoring but hard to not just pound away. 495 charactersTrevor11, Oct 24, 2016

4.09/5  rDev -10.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Tree House In Perpetuity
A: This New England IPA pours very typical for the style: hazy, light orange, not quite as orange juice-looking as some of these can be, but this is far from a clear beer. About a finger-and-a-half of snow white head sits atop, but fairly quickly it settles down into a half-finger of crust. There is nice lacing, however. Carbonation is difficult to note due to opacity. More head and retention would perfect this. 4.25/5
A: The aroma is full of pineapple, mango, passion fruit, plus a definite doughy yeastiness and some sweet malt, as is typical for a Tree House beer. There is a significantly different set of aromas coming from Nelson Sauvin that are atypical for NE IPAs as a whole, though: pine, greenery, herbs, dankness, and classic white grape notes (unfortunately subdued). The change-up in a more "green" and less fruity hop is very welcome to the Tree House profile. 4.5/5
T: Taste mostly follows the Aroma with sweet pineapple, ripe mango, and slightly tart passion fruit. Nelson brings a little greenery and just a hint of the grapiness it is famous for, but is ultimately a little underwhelming. Yeast and sweet, unrisen bread dough are present as well, not necessarily in a pleasant capacity. Bubblegum also shows up unexpectedly. There is little in the way of bitterness. While the bitterness that Nelson hops can sometimes bring is definitely missing here, this is still a tasty beer. The bubblegum flaw really throws it off, though, as does the overt yeastiness. This beer cries out for balance and cleaning up. It just comes across as a little unfinished, but, again, it is pleasant. 3.75/5
M: As usual in the substyle, mouthfeel is excellent. It is medium-full with soft carbonation and a touch of bitterness. No alcohol heat is detectable. The only flaw is that it is not quite dry enough to really make it as drinkable as it could be. 4.5/5
O: So, honestly, this tastes a lot like many other Tree House IPAs (plus just a hint of Nelson). That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is a little disappointing. The more I have, the more I realize they do come off somewhat unfinished, like the fermentation is incomplete or that the yeast are giving off off flavors. Something just tastes a little off. Very Green slipped by me since it is one of the first TH beers I had, but it too suffered from this, and if I get the chance, I will rereview it noting this. Nonetheless, there is a lot to like here. I guess personally I would like to see more variation, less "off" flavors (bubblegum, why?), and more balance (and more Nelson). Trillium, Hill Farmstead, Tired Hands, and Cellarmaker all do this better. Pair with Meshuggah's newest "The Violent Sleep of Reason," for another "Meshuggah By the Numbers," as in Tree House by the numbers. 4/5 2,795 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Oct 19, 2016

In Perpetuity expertly showcases the delicate flavors of the Nelson hops within the broader context of the Citra-forward Tree House profile that put the brewery on the map. Instead of competing with one another, I thought the white wine characteristics were carefully blended with the tropical fruits in a harmonious manner...perhaps just what Nate intended. Another stunning entry in the extensive Tree House library of IPAs. 843 charactersFireman_RK, Oct 06, 2016

Huge thanks to my friend Sean for grabbing me a can of this.
Cloudy, dark yellow ochre appearance. This looked very similar to apricot nectar. The liquid was topped by a finger-tall crop of creamy white froth that quickly fell to a clingy, lasting collar. Streaky lacing stuck along the glass.
The nose was really hoppy and intense. Super fruity and sweet. Tropical fruits came through strongest. Loads of overripe mango. Some guava and papaya as well. Big peach and apricot presence. Juicy orange notes were also apparent. With time, the tropical fruits intensified.
Fruity hops came through big time in the flavor profile as well. Tons of mango. Loads of peach and apricot. Big juicy orange notes in the center. The beer turned slightly bitter on the back end and in the finish. Orange rind was apparent. Bit of dry, lingering pithiness after the swallow. As the beer sat, the orange notes intensified.
Terrific creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Perhaps a touch lighter than I anticipated. Super soft and supple on the palate.
I feel like some of Tree House's limited release beers are overrated, but In Perpetuity definitely lived up to the hype. This might just be the most juicy, tropical fruit-forward beer in their portfolio. 1,322 charactersDamian, Oct 03, 2016

4.79/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Canned 9/22/16. Consumed 9/28/16.
A: Super hazy a la most Tree House IPAs. Comes in a medium orange color, slightly lighter than Julius. About a half finger of pillowy white head fades to a thin layer of tiny to small foam bubbles, which leave significant lacing along the sides of the glass.
S: Citra dominates up front with an underlying Nelson quality. Big notes of peach, tangerine, and pineapple. There’s definitely a herbaceous, almost vegetal resin quality as well that very much reminds me of Green. Underneath the citrus and tropical fruits, Nelson’s contributions come through. I get that earthy, musty grape note, not quite leaning toward white wine, but a bit vinous. As it warms, I get a lot more of that Juicy Fruit, bubblegumm-y note that I get so intensely in Green. It’s an extremely appealing nose that very much reminds me of a blend of Julius and Green.
T: Follows the nose pretty closely. Huge pop of citrus and tropical fruits up front. Orange, tangerine, and peach in spades. It’s similar in intensity to Julius. Mid-mouth, I get some sweet bready malt that almost perfectly separates the flavor contributions from each hop. For just a moment, the intense punch of fruit flavors subsides and a soft breadiness comes to the forefront. But as quickly as it arrived, it gives way to a moderate yet delicious Nelson flavor. It’s definitely white grape-forward, more white wine-y than the Nelson notes on the nose. Semi-sweet, very dry white grape flavors accompany a medium-minus bitterness and linger on the tongue long after the sip. 
M: As with all Tree House IPAs, this has a lush, creamy, medium-plus mouthfeel. It’s incredibly soft and delicate, but packs an enormous amount of flavor for its ABV. It has a medium-plus dryness on the finish, with a dusty white grape quality that leaves you salivating for another sip. There’s some lingering bitterness, but only just enough to cut the fruity sweetness and make for a perfectly balanced aftertaste. 
O: This is a very tough one for me to evaluate. On one hand, it’s a Tree House IPA, so I really can’t judge it by normal standards. Comparing it to Julius, Green, and Alter Ego, I think it probably sits just below Green and Julius for me (but slightly above Alter Ego). On both the nose and the taste, it has the pungency and fruit-forwardness of Julius up front and the underlying bubblegum and fresh cut herb notes of Green. The backend (esp of the taste) is where In Perpetuity completely diverges, as the dryness and earthiness of the Nelson comes through. The aftertaste lingers for a while; a mouth-coating sweet yet dry white grape flavor that leaves the tongue feeling “sticky.” If I loved Nelson hops as much as, say, Galaxy, than this could very well be my favorite Tree House IPA. For me, this is a world-class, damn-near-perfect beer that I can only knock due to personal flavor profile preferences. 2,913 charactersavas, Sep 29, 2016

Reminded me of a split between Julius and Alter Ego, with a bit more smoothness up front but also a little more bland at the end. We compared to a Dopple and Juice Machine and looked amazingly similar to both, a great sign. Hope they brew this more going forward! 360 charactersJMuro77, Sep 26, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Obtained today at brewery.  
Appearance-light orange in color.  Hazy as hell with minimal head and nice lacing 
Aroma- wine like aroma from the Nelson,  with citrus in background 
Taste- a blend of citrus-wine follows the hop aroma.  Very uniquely different from regular th offerings .   The Nelson while there does not overpower as in other beers with the hop. 
Mouthfeel- typically creamy mouthfeel (big surprise). With dry finish on back end.  
Overall-  I really like this beer but it is not the same level as green, Julius, alter, haze or the variants.  Very glad I got to try it. 590 charactersjcflorian, Sep 23, 2016

5/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received a 16 oz can in a trade when fresh and poured into a snifter. This beer is all-around amazing. If you didn't know by now, Treehouse has some awesome beers and this might be one of their best offerings! It pours with a decent amount of white-fluffy head, very hazy and peach in color. The smell / aroma is big on this one... you can smell the hops the second you crack open the can. Taste is tropical / citrus-like (same as the Julius). The feel is somewhat thin, but soft on the taste buds. Overall, this is one of the best beers they've offered to date and hope they can it again sometime soon! Cheers! 611 characterstregan_20, Oct 30, 2015

5/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5All I can say is that I've had an IPA or two and this one blows them all away, including Julius.
A: Beautiful cloudy tropical juice appearance. Soft pillowy white head that Tree House is known for.
S: Nice sweet orange, pineapple and papaya juice with a slight resin in the back.
T: Much like the aroma, sweet citrus and tropical fruit that seems like it will last forever until a slight resinous pine bitterness cuts it off.
M: Much like the appearance of the head, the feel is sweet and yet light at the same time. Carbonation really works to keep the mouthfeel pillowy and smooth.
O: My first five awarded and well deserved. I typically stick to stouts and haven't given one of them a 5 thus far. Nice work Tree House! 726 charactersTBonez477, Oct 06, 2015

A: Pours a hazy to the point of being opaque, golden apricot, 3 fingers width of slightly off white head has good retention before dissipating down and leaves lots of lacing.  4.25

The color is amber/orange hued with white head. The smell is both dank and fruity -citrus and tropical with a mouth feel that is bitter but juicy with a very good carbonation level and very resinous texture. 
The flavor is so great I mean it has slight tangerine/herbal/grapefruit orange zest and mild malt just an all around great tasting IPA. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys hop forward ales -truly remarkable. 507 charactersSlatetank, Sep 29, 2015

Pours into my Tree House tiku glass with a big fluffy creamy 1.5 finger head that fades at a slower pace, super murky solid color darker orange golden brown tan color, nice soapy lacing as well.
Nose is exactly what I remember about Tree House being awesome, big fresh juicy hops, tons of citrus orange juice, tangerine, a light pith, etc, mixed with nice floral zesty with tropical notes, juicy fruit tropical with nice mango.
Taste is heavenly, a fluffy airy light malt character, that really props up the hops, juicy tropical citrus hops all up and down. Nice citrus pith out front, a little grapefruit pith with nice juicy citrus creamy notes, tangerine, orange cream. Nice tropical, mango flesh, little peachy stone fruit, and even a little tree fruit notes. Floral Nelson notes in the back as well. Finish is dry, nice bitterness, touch sweet balance, lingering mild tangerine pith, mango flesh, and generic citrus tropical stone fruit blend. Very nice balance between everything.
Mouth is med bod, nice creamy juicy fleshy feel, great fluffy carb as well.
Overall, THIS is the kind of thing that made me grow to love Tree House. Lately it's been all mosaic and piney resinous heavy IPAs, and seemed like they were heading in the wrong direction. Then Nate goes and pulls something like this out of thin air, and bam!!! Incredible beer Nate! Glad to see you can still hit grand slams when you want to. 1,584 charactersjlindros, Sep 26, 2015

For me, this is definitely one of my favorite, but not my numero uno.  I did have a slight cold when I had it so my sense and taste buds may have been off a little.

4.41/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 32oz growler on 9/23/15, which was filled on 9/17/15 and delivered in an absolute porch bomb courtesy of SDRedDevil, an amazing BA and great guy! Looks like many other TH beers that I've had, which is to say great.  Very non-aggressive pour still led to about 3+ fingers of very fluffy white head (may very well be due to being sent in mail).  Very hazy orange in appearance, reminiscent of Alter Ego.  
Aroma was a little bit disappointing for a TH hoppy beer.  Smelled more citra than nelson on the nose, but the aroma just wasn't very strong.  Taste was very juicy and tropical fruit up front and mid palate with both orange, peaches and mango from Citra along with some melon and lemon in there showcasing the Nelson.  There is a tiny bit of bitterness on the back end, but only a hint, and it just finishes very crisp, dry and smooth.  
I've never even heard of another Citra/Nelson beer before but this makes me wonder why not.  Although it may just be that Nate is able to balance the two so well because that's just what he excels at more than almost any other brewer out there.  As is always the case with TH beers, this one is so amazingly balanced and just smooth.  Definitely not as creamy or as in your face juice bomb as many of their other offerings, but its complex and very well balanced.  Definitely a fantastic beer....that being said, I still don't fully understand the totally over the top ratings this beer is getting.  It is amazing no doubt, and it is better than their average offering (which is already just incredible), however, I was still expecting more given the intense hype behind this beer.  That however is not the fault of the beer or of TH... 1,694 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Sep 24, 2015
5/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a hazy deep orange, almost like peach juice, with a soft fluffy white head.
The aroma jumps out of peaches, mango, sweet juicy orange, Juicy Fruit gum, green hop matter, fresh cut herbs, along with that vinous and white grape Nelson quality.
The flavor follows with juicy peach, passionfruit, hints of melon, tangerine, a creamy mouthfeel and chewy light white bready malt, the beer then transitions to an intense drying of straight hops, grass, and Nelson white wine drying.
The beer is a combination of so many amazing things. IPA version of Present Moment, combination of Julius, Alter Ego, with lots of Green, and a smaller version of Hill Farmstead Society and Solitude #4. Neck and neck with Green has the best IPA. 742 charactersdar482, Sep 24, 2015

S: Upon smelling this gem, I can immediately tell that Citra hops are involved. Waves of papaya, mango, and orange invade my nostrils. I also catch some lemon from the Nelson hops. This beer smells fantastic. I've never smelled Citra and Nelson hops together before, but this is definitely a treat.
T: The taste follows the nose very well. I get the papaya, mango, orange and lemon in waves. I also get the trademark Tree House malt flavor. This is very enjoyable. There's some bitterness, but just enough to not make this overpowering. 
F: I'm not quite sure what the ABV on this is, but there's not alcohol to speak of. A light to medium bodied beer is what this is. I could easily drink more than 1 growler of this. Simply incredible.
Overall: This is one of Tree House's best IPAs they've ever brewed. Nate really knows what he's doing when it comes to hoppy beers. The combination of Nelson and Citra is something that I've never experience and I'm really glad I had the opportunity too. Top notch beer from a top notch brewery! 1,168 charactersRichD, Sep 21, 2015

Pours a magnificent bright orange body with a frothy white head that reduces slowly to leave substantial lacing and a layer of retention. 
Aromas are bursting with tropical fruits, creamy oranges, citrus, passionfruit. This is going to be good!
Wow.. on the tongue is straight juicyness.. tropical fruit, oranges, fruit punch, sitting on a perfectly balanced  malt background that imparts a delicious full creamyness that works perfectly with the hop profile. Mouthfeel is awesome too, medium and satisfying with medium-low carbonation for easy drinkability. 
Overall a true masterpiece, might be my favorite so far from Treehouse. 724 charactersgcamparone, Sep 20, 2015

A thick and creamy white head rises up quickly sticking around for quite some time. Large belt drops sheets and drizzled webs all around the glass.
S- As one might expect, the aroma is hoppy. Passion fruit instantly comes to mind as the dominant tone with mango, citrus fruits, floral and dank herbal notes as well. Juicy fruits.
T- Honestly, the aroma is a letdown compared to what happens here. Spectacularly juicy stone and tropical fruit flavors absolutely dominate the palate with some hints of white wine, grapes and berries. Passionfruit, mango, tangerine, apricot, berries, mint, cantaloupe, melon and orange citrus hints. Dankness throughout. Hints of the bubble-gum Tree House yeastness.
MF- Medium bodied overall with a creamy-frothy consistency on the palate. High end carbonation allows those hop flavors to truly pop with intensity and nuanced complexity. Finishes with just a hint of bitterness which really suits the flavor.
The aroma is good and somehow the flavor is just out of this world; perhaps one of the best tastes in an IPA I have had in a long, long time. Pretty much covers the spectrum of hop greatness all in one swoop. Keep it up over in Monson and I will keep heading out there; just wow. 1,301 characterscbutova, Sep 19, 2015

S: Melon, bubblegum sweetness, white wine, tropical citrus, sticky hop dankness. Sweetness combined with tropical notes really seem to be the dominant aromas.
T: Upon sipping, it reminds me of "Julius" with the orange like citrus that can be detected, but then it quickly transitions into "Green" with the strong notes of melon. Doesn't taste as sweet as I detected initially in the aroma. Juicy, citrus hops burst in the mouth. Definitely a lot closer in taste to "Julius".
M: Soft, pillowy mouthfeel. Hops are slightly prickly to the tongue. Incredibly smooth, balanced and crisp. Slight bitterness, but almost unnoticeable and there is no dryness. Medium carbonation. Body is reminiscent to Tree House "Green".
O: Another amazing beer by Tree House…up there with "Green", "Alter Ego" and "Julius". Exceptional cross between "Julius" and "Green". On 9/18/15 I did a taste test between Julius and IP and I have to give the nod to IP as it seems to be a tad more complex taste and mouthfeel wise. 1,146 charactersMA_hops, Sep 17, 2015

The taste is incredibly juicy and brimming with tropical fruit goodness, fresh can less than one week old. Alcohol barely detected, this is very nicely done.
Soft mouthfeel, medium light body, velvety smooth drinking.
Julius get tons of love, but I prefer In Perpetuity more. I wish Tree House would settle on some of these fantastic recipes rather than making them one offs that soon become nothing but a pleasant memory: small beef but I'm sure there are some of you that can relate to what I'm saying.

T= Floral, citrus, bit of malt sweetness with tropical fruits and grape must on the tail end.
M= Medium body with moderate carbonation. 
O= Another big hop forward IPA from Tree House, great ability to balance and connect the flavors and aroma.  Looks good, smells good, tastes good!  What more could you ask? 592 charactersjhavs, Sep 15, 2015

Nose expresses sweet citrus upfront followed by grapefruit rind.  Taste follows nose; however, rind quality also comes off a bit medicinal in the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with an even carbonation.  Overall, a very nice American IPA - refreshing and drinkable. 418 charactersJwale73, Sep 14, 2015

Pours an opaque amber color with a great head that leaves lacing. Smells like pure hops, leafy, sweet, juicy, very inviting. First sip reveals a completely different IPA than what I'm used to. It starts off sweet and then goes right into these very unique hops. Very bitter but lots of vegetal fruits like guava, melon, and papaya. Chewy and smooth mouthfeel, really easy to drink the 16oz of this unique IPA. 
Overall an amazing beer, some say it's better than Julius but I have to disagree with that. A few notches below Julius but nothing to be ashamed of, it's still awesome. 652 charactersBranfordBound, Sep 13, 2015

Look: Hazy Orange with persistent carbonation and nice head.
Smell: Tropical Citra and Nelson goodness. Citrus, Sauvignon Blanc Grapes, and a touch of malty goodness. Could be a little more intense, but still solid.
Taste: Like a fine wine. I can see why one would want to toast with this beer. Very Complex, delicious, a little sour citrus, with a little bitterness that really makes the mouth salivate. Probably deserves a 5 will try for next few weeks.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied with a great balance of carbonation, palate coating hops (but not overly bitter), and a delicious citrus/white wine sourness.
Overall: Truly solid. This beer probably deserves a 5 and I may give it just that after subsequent tastings. Another solid performance for the greatest brewery IMO. 803 charactersMatthewHopHead, Sep 12, 2015

This beer is an absolute treat. From the brilliant can art work, to the cloudy, hazy, "orange-juicy"  hue and color; This is it.
Nose has the really CLEAN tropical dance (Fleshy papaya and mango). 
Taste is a perfect pillowy balance of bitterness from the nelson hops and an elegant citrus 'Twang'  on the back drop. 
Delicious. I would do anything to learn how to brew like Nate. 445 charactersBorkman18, Sep 12, 2015
4.75/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 16 oz can into a stout glass (a gorgeous 16 oz can I might add).
The pour is hazy, and deep orange with a frothy all-white head that leaves tons of lacing. 
The aroma is filled with notes of peaches and orange peel. Nothing complex, but an absolutely intoxicating aroma. 
The taste is similar to Julius, however there's a lot more peach and mango flavors in this one. The Nelson hops take the driver's seat here, and have created what is easily the juiciest, most tropical IPA I've ever tasted in my life. The bready malt is extremely well-hidden, but is present and gives a subtle balance to this beer. 
The feel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Creamy, smooth, no lingering bitterness or alcohol to be detected. 
I would say Tree House has a pretty distinct profile for all their IPA's, but this is not even remotely a criticism. I literally cannot get enough of it. The tropical, almost candied sweetness is balanced by a subtle, piney hop bitterness. And my god the aroma! I'm not sure how they pack so much flavor and aroma into a 16 oz can but they do it again and again, beer after beer. 
TH, please stop making beer like this. I'd like to at least have a working kidney in 5 years. 1,218 charactersScaryEd, Sep 12, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +4.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Picked up some cans of this at the brewery. Just a phenomenal story behind this beer and the label. Really, really heart warming. 
A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a super solid orange hue with lighter yellows/golds on the outside. Like a glass of orange juice. Fat almost two finger white head fades nice and slow until it leaves a thick one finger blanket. Wowzer.
S - Aromas of...I can't believe I'm about to write this...peaches. Lightly sweet peach aroma going on, soft mangoes, great Nelson notes of white wine and grapes, maybe some faint melon notes. Ripe papaya, very light malts. The citrus is there, orange peel and such with some light juiciness. Superb balance between Citra and Nelson.
T - Taste is a brief flash of peach up front and then loads of melon and melon rind. Great Nelon, almost musty white wine and grapes. Nice tropical notes too the mango is fairly hidden I think, instead I get loads of papaya and maybe some guava. Fainter grapefruit, moreso on the finish lending it's bitterness. The malt is simple and clean, offering some balance and backbone to the hops.
M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, fluffy, little crisp. 
O - Overall this was an incredibly aromatic IPA. Just a great balance between Citra and Nelson. No one hop or aspect takes front and center stage, instead they all work in harmony to create a really pleasurably drinking experience. Well done Nate and congratulations to Lauren and you.

So smooth and perfect amount of bitterness makes it real easy to drink. I felt the flavor leaned more towards the Nelson (Melon/Stonefruit) type flavors, but the citrus was definitely detectable as well. So happy I have 7 more to drink!
Bottom line: Another amazing IPA from Tree House. Definitely on the same tier as Green and Julius. 447 charactersryanflc, Sep 12, 2015

Similar body and head to Julius: orange, orange, and more orange, with a frothy white head of two fingers. Nose and taste of peach, mango, citrus: again, reminiscent of Julius. I do feel as if I like this beer a bit more. Maybe it drinks a little cleaner, goes down a little smoother. If only I could've enjoyed them side by side! The mouthfeel on this beer is heavenly soft. Quite the wedding anniversary gift if you ask me! A beautiful beer, and an instant winner as far as I'm concerned. I hope this one makes it into the regular rotation at Tree House!!! 613 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Sep 12, 2015

This is exactly what you would come to expect from any TH offering. Tons of fruit taste (mango, peach, papaya, melon), a velvety finish, and an overall crushable experience have become de rigueur from the folks in Monson, MA. I'm hoping that the title speaks for itself, and that this beer will brewed again in the near future. 410 charactersmrblonde37, Sep 12, 2015

Tropical sweet taste with a very slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and fluffy, but a little thinner than I expected. Getting tons of nelson but not much citra. I enjoyed this so much i am contemplating taking the 3 hour round trip a second time this week before this beer is gone, great follow up to beneficiaries of chance, I just hope it isn't another year before we see this again! 590 charactersEvmo31, Sep 11, 2015
4.87/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75L - Dark hazy orange. Glows a murky copper brown in the middle with golden lacing around the edges. Beautiful on its own, but I've seen better from Tree House!
S - Peach. Extremely lofty and high up there on the "light fruit" scale. I could smell this for days. The Nelson is distinctly there, but doesn't turn into the deeply vinous grapey smell. Stays light and aloft, but reminds you of the rock solid hop backbone this beer shows off. Lots of mango and tangerine. Some starfruit too. 
T - More peach up front. Mango and papaya blend. Equatorial bouquet of exotic grapes and stone fruit. Schrodinger's beer of subtle and potent white wine. Tastes like a tropical island. Cantaloupe and honeydew. Not many beers are able to evoke such strong images of a gently rocking crystal blue ocean, palm trees fluttering in the background, with the setting sun casting an orange glow. The label says a nighttime walk on the beach, but that's up for interpretation, right?
F - Lush and fluffy, as with all Tree House brews. Bounces on the tongue, then drifts off into slumber as it coats the mouth. 
O - Another brilliant Tree House beer. Juicy without being cloying, unique vinous characteristics, and the perfect amount of balancing bitterness in the finish. Damn this is a good one. 1,280 charactersagreenman19, Sep 11, 2015

T - Nelson Nuke! white grape, sherbet, lime. No real citra except for a slight orange juice, but it's still delicious.
F- soft and pillowy like a cloud. No alcohol. Crushable.
O - Comparable to Alpine Nelson. a lack of Citra, but the result is so good, I don't even care. If you have a hard-on for Nelson hops, then this is your jam. 511 charactersThrewRedButter, Sep 10, 2015
