4.04/5  rDev -10%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pirate Bomb pours a watery, shiny dark brown with a bubbly, dark tan head--it's obvious it has thinned out.
When I was pouring this, I could smell the rum heat emanating off of the rim, then all of a sudden it was gone as I brought it to my nose, replaced by roasty coffee, caramel, nougat and wet cocoa.
Wow--sweet, round flavors of Tootsie Roll and fudge spoil the tongue, with caramel swirled coffee ice cream following right after. Actually, as I swirl it around my mouth, it almost tastes like a Butterfinger! There is some true gold spiced rum flavor without the heat, but there's not much coffee or Mexican spices to speak of. I can barely tell this was BOMB! A touch of wet cinnamon barely emerges as it warms, but there is more dry, aged dark oak barrel and walnut shell than cinnamon, and it's overall much sweeter than any of the other big name Prairie stouts I've had. 
The body is much thinner than regular BOMB!, and it's bubbly, with a slick stickiness. Overall it is less complex and less intense than Pirate Noir. 1,033 charactersSabtos, May 09, 2017

4.42/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This is a solid Imperial Stout and is a mastery of the style. Pours thick and dark with little head or carbonation. Had in a tulip glass near room temperature.
Nose is pretty stellar. Definitely pick up on some heavy spice notes, plenty of cocoa and some bourbon. It's been mentioned here already, but definitely more peppery in the nose than in the body, where it's nearly nonexistent. Get some heavy hints of coconut, which isn't normally my bag, but it works well with the rum flavors that are present. It's a heavy hitter, to be sure, with a fudgy feel that doesn't leave an overly dry finish. All in all, this is a solid do that I'd drink again if I can get my hands on a bottle. 685 charactersumichfan, Apr 20, 2017

Funny story - when the cashier rang this up at the register she paused and I said "I think this is mislabeled - it's $11.99." Nope! Just me paying top dollar for a highly rated beer that I've never seen in MA. Carry on.
Pours a viscous black out of the bottle. Big aroma of fire-roasted malt, chocolate, coconut and faint molasses. Taste is all Bomb! minus the chili pepper and coffee - in its place I get more coconut, chocolate and sugar-cane sweetness. What a beer! Never had a rum barrel aged beer so it's new to my palate. Mouthfeel is thick, slick and velvety. The sweetness pushes my preference to the limits but it's still a very well made and impressive. Coats the mouth with lingering coconut and sugar cane. Rum always smells like sunscreen to me but there was none of that here. Massive beer that put me down at the end of a night. Great nightcap to share. 954 charactersManapuaMan, Apr 11, 2017

Pours a pitch black, oily body with a brown one finger head that reduces to leave a ring of foam and little lacing. 
Aromas are sweet with lots of vanilla and chocolate, bourbon, light chili peppers, maybe a hint of booze but it's surprisingly tame for being 15%. 
On the tongue.. it starts out with sweet fudgy chocolate, spiced rum, vanilla and caramel, coconut and chocolate cake, followed by roasty coffee and charred malt on the finish. Not hot at all for 15%, this is very easy to drink. Smooth and velvety yet rich and flavorful. Low carbonation. 
Overall a fantastic beer - super balance and extremely drinkable for the high abv. So much flavor here. 794 charactersgcamparone, Apr 07, 2017

Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, pretty nice carbonation, with a quick fizzy tan head, which leaves a nice oil slick and some minimal sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with lot of chocolate/toffee, coffee, vanilla, and a very nice touch of peppers. The taste is very nice, malty, very nice touch of chocolate/toffee/coffee, vanilla, and some peppers. The peppers give it another dimension. Full body, ABV is hidden very well, definitely a sipper.

Aroma : Hot fudge, chocolate, booze, spiced rum, chiles, tobacco, and coffee. Whew.
Taste : Another dead-ass knock out. Prairie keeps solidifying the fact that they're the masters of the stout. Boozy burn to start, followed by spicy hot fudge, acidic coffee, pepper, anise, caramel, rich rum, and a vanilla cookie finish. 
Feel : Thick, chewy, hot, screaming. Boozy dry finish. Carbonation is moderate. 
Overall : Pirate Bomb is no joke. Prairie makes the best stouts in the entire world, and this is just another example of their excellence. 637 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Apr 04, 2017

4.57/5  rDev +1.8%look: 3.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Bottle I think dated Feb, 2016:
Pours thinner than I recall other Bombs I've had, but still full-looking.  Black that struggles to priduce any head, happy to just have a thin ring of bubbles hang around the rim.
Nose is bursting with deep roasted coffee easily recognizable.  A nice chocolate scent seems to bubble from this.  There is an air of sweetness, molasses-like that covers this all.  Reminds me a tad of Sunday Morning Stout.
Taste starts of with a tingle before a sugary sweet coffee roast rises on the front of my tongue.  It almost seems too sweet, but the roasted notes turn chocolatey on the middle of the tongue, making the sweetness seem ok.  A little prick here and there breaks through the creamy thick smooth beer.  Then as the beer consumes my tongue, the more obvious signs of pepper gains my attention.  There's a very little hint of the pepper meat, as well.
The completely bearable heat is what takes this beer up a notch.  It distracts a bit from the sweetness and lightens the fairly heavy feel just a tad.  The rum barrel influence might come in the sweetness and a little alcohol heat that leads to the peppery heat.  There is also a very light lingering woody impression, but otherwise is thankfully (in my case) not a big component of the beer. 1,278 characterscjgiant, Apr 01, 2017

Complex with many layers of aroma and flavor.  Tons of vanilla and coconut.  The pepper is subdued but adds to the complexity.  For such a high ABV, the alcohol is in the background.  Nice thick feel.   Really good stuff. 278 charactersTucquan, Mar 20, 2017

(2016 vintage?  can't find bottle code but I bought this beer in 2016)
L:  motor oil look, thick and black with about 1/5-inch head of tan foam; keeps a thin collar; no stick or lace; relatively flat looking like BOMB! often looks
S:  German chocolate cake loaded with extra coconut, some rum poured on top
T:  chocolate, vodka, coconut, vanilla ... the alcohol is hot, much much hotter than regular BOMB!; maybe some chile heat in the aftertaste
F:  a lot more carbonation than appears in the pour, relatively light and not overly slick when its cold and I'm adjusting to it, but the deeper into the glass (and warmer the beer), it feels like it's gaining weight
O:  great beer, not a thing wrong with it, I like regular BOMB! much better ... they compare almost one-to-one but the Pirate version is way jacked up on the alcohol burn/heat in the flavor; as it warms, the rum does show up and make for a cool twist, but the twist doesn't show up until the beer's warmed a bit 1,018 charactersPremo88, Mar 06, 2017

A: Essentially black, opaque, and has minimal visible carbonation. Forms a thin brown head that fades fairly quickly.
S: Chocolate and chilies, tobacco and vanilla. Dark roasted malts and dry tannins. Not much, if any, rum barrel on the nose.
T: Chocolate, chilies and tobacco up front. Sweet old, worn leather. Cinnamon, vanilla, and rum, though there isn't a huge rum (nor barrel) presence here either. Chocolate and chilies swell back up at the swallow, with a touch of spicy pepper character.
M: A full-bodied, sticky mouthfeel, though not as heavy as some Imperial Stouts. Low carbonation sensation, and the alcohol presence is well-integrated.
O: This is just as good as the base BOMB!...but it doesn't taste much different either. The rum barrel treatment is almost missing completely, but it certainly doesn't add anything. But still a very tasty beer. 968 charactersmacrosmatic, Feb 24, 2017

4.4/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A: Pours an opaque yet still clear thick viscous jet black in color with light to moderate amounts of gentle carbonation along the edges of the glass and faint dark cola brown highlights. The beer has a finger tall dark mocha head that slowly reduces to a large patch of thin film covering about 95% of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Moderate to strong aromas of roasted malts, freshly brewed espresso, chili peppers, dark chocolate, vanilla, and rum. Moderate aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice with a light to moderate aroma of molasses. Light notes of dark fruit (plum + fig).
T: Upfront there is a moderate to strong flavor of roasted malts with a hint of charred malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amount of molasses and dark chocolate sweetness as well was some light flavors of dark fruit (plum + fig) . That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of chili peppers, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice with strong flavors of freshly brewed espresso. Finally there is a slightly stronger than moderate flavor of vanilla and rum. Light to moderate amounts of roasty bitterness which is quickly overtaken by moderate amounts of rum sweetness and chili pepper heat in the finish.
M: Full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Some warming in the finish (likely a combonation of alcohol and chili peppers).
O: The rum barrel aging really adds significantly to this beer, and in a very positive fashion - I feel like the rum brings out different aspects of this beer than the bourbon barrel aged base beer. Great complexity but still well balanced. Very enjoyable and pretty easy to drink considering the strength, alcohol is well hidden from the flavor and aroma. 1,770 charactersdbrauneis, Feb 02, 2017

The appearance is a beautiful jet black with a quickly disappearing mocha head.. the smell is fantastic- Rum leads the way.. followed closely by coffee, chocolate and a vanilla/coconut sweetness- Perfect!..
The taste steals the show as it is not only a carbon copy of the smell, but sits beautifully on the palate and lingers with a long finish.. I want to drink this beer ALL the time.. in fact, I'd like to brush my teeth with it!..
One of the finest barrel aged Imperial Stouts you will ever drink. If you're lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time, snatch this one up.. Quickly!..
Cheers!... 665 charactersMusicBeer_1961, Jan 30, 2017

Appearance: Deep, dark coffee brown with a light brown foamy heady. A good fringe of foam lingers and leaves some nice lacing.
Smell: Rich dark coffee, chocolate, molasses and roasted malts. Hints of oak and alcohol and nice chili spice.
Taste: Rich, roasted and sweet with plenty of roasted coffee, chocolate and vanilla. Chili spice keeps the sweetness balances along with nice oak barrel and boozy notes from the rum barrels.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body, velvety smooth with moderate carbonation.
Overall: Much like the original Bomb! - full flavored and complex with added coffee, spice and barrel notes elevating a strong stout base. Rum barrel aging is subtle with a little extra oak and booze peeking through. 788 charactersHipCzech, Jan 15, 2017

A: Nice cocoa cereal colored head; about a finger. Quickly dissolves to just a thin, lopsided ring. Black in the glass; very dark brown in the dimple, with red-brown edge. Solid sheeting. Very thin lines of lacing. Slight inkiness.
S: Much darker aroma than I'd expected. Heavily charred oak barrels, or maybe just rum made from black strap. Very dark chocolate cake; like, nearly burned. Dark caramel. Light amount of dark roast coffee. Charred wood, like from a campfire. Light graphite.
T/MF: Oh! It starts off sweet, but not overly so, with darker flavors. Char with a sweet edge, medium coffee, bittersweet chocolate, rum raisin, slight cookie spice, slight oatmeal, wood smoke. Then, there is a sudden burst of sticky sweetness. Maple syrup. Raisin and chocolate coated fig. Honey.
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass. 1,012 charactersTruePerception, Jan 01, 2017

Quickly receding head leaves just the faintest of mocha head around the ring of the glass. Smell is sweet, deep coffee, vanilla and faint roast. Rum barrel is present but very light. More coffee on the taste. It dominates the flavor but still allows the vanilla, rum, roast, chocolate, and just a bit of heat from the peppers. The mouthfeel is a tad light but so crushable even at 15%. I am so impressed and loving this beer. It drinks completely unexpected but so amazing. 505 charactersstrohme2, Jan 01, 2017

Pours opaque pitch black. Beige bubbles form but, never really produce a head. No lace. The smell is dominated by coffee with subtle vague spice aromas. The taste is more balanced with dark chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, green chillies and vanilla. Full texture with low carbonation. Mexican hot cocoa spiked with rum. World class. 343 charactersFurlinator, Dec 21, 2016
4.67/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle poured into snifter in Austin, TX. Black as night with a fine, dark khaki collar and no head. The nose on this thing is like a multi-layered bean dip. You find coffee, peppers, molasses, booze, figs, graham cracker. Rich and roasty. The palate is marvelous and complex, a deep tapestry of cocoa, coffee, toasty malts, fig, a vanilla profile not caught on the nose, and at the very end you find the rum. A warm, boozy burn follows up a lingering coffee profile.
This beer is so good the words I've provided don't do it justice. The profile is so varied and unique, the only beer I can think to compare it to is the limited run Weasel Rodeo, a chipotle coffee stout produced by Jester King and Mikkeler in 2012. 
Seriously, seriously great beer. 752 charactersMrHolden, Dec 21, 2016

Pours the usual stout dark with medium head, its smell gets you curious no doubt BUT the taste

S - first and foremost: rum. Caught that whiff the moment I broke the seal on the cap. Faintest boozey nose-hair tingling burn at the end. The middle is packed with vanilla and peppers. Medium roast black coffee and dark fruits. Toasted marshmallows. 
T - so much more vanilla up front on the tongue. Rum takes a back seat to delicious flavors of toasted chiles, milk chocolate, oak, and brown sugar. Peanuts and toasted almonds. The rum creeps in on the back end and its high ABV alcohol burn pairs beautifully with light chile heat. Two aggressive and burning flavor sensations set aside their differences and come together to regale tales of the high seas while drinking that XXX and singing YOHOHO.
F - surprisingly thin for 14%! Wow this is dangerous! Silky and light-bodied. 
O - YAR A PIRATE'S LIFE FOR ME! Packed full of unique and interesting flavors. Love the lip tingling effect. And at 14% I'm gonna be swabbing the poop deck later tonight! 1,146 charactersagreenman19, Dec 01, 2016

Jalapeno, black coffee, milk chocolate, cotton candy, and dark fruits to the nose.  In that order.
Hot and fruity and peppery and chocolaty all at the same time.  And there's some rum and wood off in there as well.  Wow. 
Not even heavy.  Potent.  But not even hot.  Sweet, but not even cloying.

Jet black pour, oily with a quickly dissipating head. Lots of sweetness in the aroma, vanilla and dark sugars. More of the same in the taste, with the vanilla coming out the most, complimenting the rum, lesser notes of chocolaty malts and allspice, very little pepper, which I actually prefer to be on the mellow side. Body was on the thin side, but the mouthfeel was still smooth and pleasant, making for a nicely sippable beer overall. One of the better ones I've had from Prairie. 513 charactersRifugium, Oct 31, 2016

4.29/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 412oz bottle, undated and no batch number, poured into a Prairie Artisan Ales Prairie Dog Teku. Enjoyed on 10.8.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a thick, jet black color, intensely opaque with a thin bone colored head, little retention and spots of lace. The aroma is nice, rich and decadent, tons of dark chocolate, spices, rum barrel, light caramel, chili, vanilla bean and a touch of roastiness. The flavors are excellent, coffee really jumps out with tons of chocolate behind it, rum and spices integrate nicely with some wood barrel, vanilla bean and caramel with just a touch of chili pepper heat. The mouthfeel is thick, coating, full bodied, rich and heavy with low carbonation and a silk finish with a touch of heat.
Verdict: A great rum barrel aged stout from Prairie. Perhaps a bit less integrated and cohesive as the bourbon Bomb! but there is a lot to love here. Lots of great chocolate and spice flavor from the rum, coffee really comes through flavor wise and the vanilla helps to mellow out the heat from the chili. Definitely a top notch beer. 1,078 characterskevanb, Oct 18, 2016

A- pours jet black in color with a small foamy dark tan head that reduces to leave nothing behind
S- aroma opens up with fresh coffee, along with aromas of cinnamon, pepper skin & nutmeg.  Dark chocolate fudge notes mix with the rum barrel to give notes of brown sugar, molasses, vanilla & oak
T- big burst of fresh coffee up front with the sweetness form the rum barrel immediately making a presence.  Mid-palate brings notes of cinnamon poking through, along with more sweetness, brown sugar, black strap molasses.  The finish brings just a touch of pepper heat, along with roasted malt and more molasses sweetness 
M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns creamy into the finish, slightly warming alcohol on the linger 
O- quite interesting how much sweetness is added by the rum barrel.  At times the sweetness tends to overpower the adjunct ingredients.  Alcohol is hidden pretty well for 14% 975 charactersTreyliff, Aug 13, 2016

4.16/5  rDev -7.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 412 ounce bottle into a snifter. 
Pours gooey and viscous pitch-black with a dark khaki-head. Frothy and persistent. 
Smells like brownies. Or brownie mix. With rum. Lots of both. Oak, vanilla, char, spice. Bold aroma but very appealing to me. 
A lot of booze in that flavor, it doesn't hide much. Then chocolatey notes, oak, and rum spice, vanilla. Don't get really any spice. 
Damn the booze is heavy here. Spicy, astringent and it cuts through the thick viscous body and prevents the beer's thickness and sweetness to truly be enjoyed. Then again, the more I drink the less bothersome it is. Imagine that. 
Some nice flavors, but still very hot. 652 charactersONovoMexicano, Jul 10, 2016

4.57/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Many thanks to jvgoor3786 for this bottle!
A - Pitch black pour with a micro-thin toffee colored lacing ring, serious legs on the sides of the glass, very viscous, and no carbonation.
S - Chocolate molasses, rum, oak, coconut, and some vanilla.
T - Dominated by chocolate and rum throughout (no complaints here).  Also has some vanilla, oak, coconut, and some alcohol/pepper burn on the back end as it slides down the throat.
M - Big, thick, full bodied, syrupy, sticky and alcohol effervescence shoots up through the sinuses.
O - This beer is fantastic and can easily hold its own against any of the other big barrel aged stouts out there.  (And you know who I'm talking about.)  Highly recommended. 705 charactersjzeilinger, Jun 19, 2016
4.44/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass:
Appearance: pours super black and oily, with a thin, khaki colored foam on top. Head dissipates rather quickly, leaving a ring of mocha around the outside. Body is totally opaque and black, even when swirled.
Aroma: layers of complexity here. The first hit I got was the vanilla, followed by a touch of that coconutty, boozy rum scent. The last note that hits the nose is the chili, which punctuates the sweetness nicely.
Taste: wow, this was a really unique stout. The first taste is chocolatey deliciousness, which is a dime a dozen in imperial stouts. Still, very potent. What comes next, though, is what makes this beer a step above the rest in terms of complexity. I got a bunch of the sweetness and some mild heat from the rum barrel, followed by a solid smack of vanilla. Finishing notes come with the chili heat, which is more of the dry, lightly spicy jalapeno flavor than a hot, spicy note. Really subtle and understated.
Feel: thick and syrupy, following in the footsteps of regular BOMB! Everything I'd want in an imperial stout.
Overall: an amazing brew from Prairie, and certainly worth the price. 1,162 charactersTheElectricOne, Jun 19, 2016

I finally got to try it this year and am amazed - one that definitely lives up to the hype. I loved regular bomb and BA bomb, but this takes it to a new level. I've had rum aged beers that didn't add much to the original but this one is different. I got a lot of vanilla, coffee and rum. The rum really pushes the vanilla and chocolate. Super awesome beer and defined lay worth finding! 421 charactersPerfecTool, Jun 05, 2016

4.48/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured at 50°F from a 12oz bottle (bottled on 08Apr16) into a Spiegelau Stout glass. Consumed on 03Jun16.
SMELL: Very strong aromas of sweet chocolate are backed by strong aromas of coffee and vanilla. Mild aromas of oak, rum, and coconut make the barrel aging apparent. The subtle aromas of spicy chilies add just the right amount of heat. 
TASTE: An initial boozy sweetness is instantly perceived as very strong sweet chocolate and strong rum flavors explode on to the palate. The beer grows more savoury as strong coffee and vanilla immediately follow. Mild barrel flavors of oak and coconut next caress the palate and further increase the goodness of this brew. In a final act, mild spicy flavors of chilies and subtle bitter roasted malt flavors enter as all previous flavors maintain. Just like in the aromas, the chilies provide just the right amount of heat.
FEEL: Full-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down incredibly smooth and creamy. Due to the high alcohol content, the beer finishes with a strong and unpleasant dryness.
NOTE: How do you make Bomb! better without bourbon barrel aging it? You rum barrel age it! 1,128 charactersMyotus, Jun 04, 2016

Full bodied and creamy on the palate - well balanced flavors on the front and the rum lingering to the back along with the chili-pepper! This is Treasure in a Bottle!!

This is much more appealing to me. I like the rum barrel action, and have liked it in a few other beers. This was probably a 14.99 or 16.99 bottle - I forget which - and while I would probably pass on regular Bomb next year, I'd grab one of these again. Pineapple rum and chocolate fun. 373 charactersGreywulfken, May 28, 2016

~3 months from bottling date
Appearance- Pours a black color, opaque, oily body. Thin layer of dark tan colored head, soapy / bubbly, dissipates to almost nothing. Tons of alcohol legs, coats and sticks to glass.
Aroma- Rich, fudgy, gourmet chocolates, dark chocolates, dry cocoa, bittersweet. Rum, spiced oak, dark fruity notes. Rich chocolate rum cake. Tons of vanilla, coconut, and caramel. Mild spicy, peppery heat.
Taste- Dark chocolates, creamy milk chocolates, mocha coffee, vanilla, and caramel. Rum, spicy dry oak, dark fruits soaked in boozy rum, lots of coconut. Spicy, peppery chillies on the finish.
Feel- Full bodied, velvety, creamy and smooth, slightly drying at times from oak and spice. Lower carbonation.
Overall- Rum barrel takes an already great beer to an even more incredible level. Lots of vanilla imparted, and a wonderful coconut and dry, spicy oak dimension. Chili peppers are noticeable but so well balanced into the beer, not too harsh. Rum is very forward, but not too boozy. Tastes like a gourmet chocolate rum cake w/ coconut and chillies as toppings. 1,101 charactersOrangeMen, May 28, 2016

The flavor profile is very similar with notes of roasted malts, spices, chilies, oak, rum, and toffee. It is on the sweet side, but still well balanced. Mouth feel has a medium-full consistency, and is smooth, creamy, filling, and delightful too. Overall, it's a very tasty brew. Plenty of subtle hints and notes to seek out here.

Pours dense pitch black color with a minimal foamy tan head that reduces to a thin ring of lace pretty quickly. Minimal spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, fudge, toffee, vanilla, molasses, cinnamon, clove, rum, oak, toasted coconut, chili pepper, light dark fruit/char, and roast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee/vanilla/pepper spice, and rum barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, fudge, toffee, vanilla, molasses, cinnamon, clove, rum, oak, toasted coconut, chili pepper, light dark fruit/char, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate roast/char bitterness and rum/oak/pepper spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, fudge, toffee, vanilla, molasses, cinnamon, clove, rum, oak, toasted coconut, chili pepper, light dark fruit/char, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee/vanilla/pepper spice, and rum barrel flavors; with a fantastic roasted bitter/sweet and oak/pepper spiciness balance with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitter/spiciness as well. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy/silky/slick, and fairly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is well hidden with a small warmth lingering after the finish; with some light pepper heat as well. Overall this is a mind blowing barrel aged spiced stout! All around insane complexity, robustness, and balance dark/roasted malt, coffee/vanilla/pepper spice, and rum barrel flavors; and very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. A world class offering for sure. 1,918 characterssuperspak, May 08, 2016

Aroma is sweet rum and milk chocolate on the nose.  Vanilla, coffee, molasses, and caramel malt as prominent complements.  
Again, run leads on first sip.  Coffee is stronger than the nose.  Milk chocolate is smooth and sweet.  Vanilla, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, and brown sugar mix underneath.  Just a hint of the peppers with a slight boost as it warms.
Smooth, rich, thick body.  Moderate carbonation.  Sweet with lingering rum.  Oily on the tongue.
Fantastic rum aged stout.  Avoids being syrupy but maintains a nice sweetness.  An upgrade over a superb base beer 757 charactersleroybrown10, May 07, 2016

Chocolate and rum flavors play together on the tongue.  Can't pick up any vanilla or coffee though.  And this isn't as thick as the base beer in the mouthfeel dept.  Overall:  tasty!  I liked BA Bomb better though.
FOLLOW UP:  2nd bottle shared with friends.  Actually totally different experience - I thoroughly enjoyed this.  The rum element, which felt way too sweet on the first try, felt much more balanced - it had great depth, and you could taste the oak from the rum barrel too.  I also picked up all of the elements, vanilla ,chocolate, coffee, peppers, rum, oak.  Really, really delicious nightcap on a night full of great beers.  Adjusted rating due to very favorable 2nd experience, split the difference from the first review. 929 charactersChcshammonde, May 02, 2016

Rich palate of honey-infused chocolate, rum, coffee, vanilla, and wood, with a touch of sugar in the middle, and black and chili pepper to finish.  Absolutely decadent and delicious; a smooth, viscous dessert beer.  Would definitely like to get my hands on more. 367 charactersfloyd_pugman, May 02, 2016

But, count me on the side that prefers Pirate over regular bomb. The smell is all cocoa and rum as is the taste.  The rum is faint and subtle but it definitely adds a desirable twist over regular bomb. I am having this very fresh, so I would recommend it fresh.  I don't see how aging could improve this at all. 392 charactersnawpnawp, Apr 24, 2016

Right off, I prefer the original Bomb! to this, which is a good thing for me, as that's always on the shelf around here... and is a few bucks cheaper. Straight out of the fridge, this beer has an interest aroma of rum, hoisin sauce, coffee, roast, vanilla, and oak -- the hoisin sauce is strangely pretty strong initially.
The taste at fridge temp is quite similar, with a bit of a soy sauce vibe, coffee/roast/vanilla/oak, and a bit of an alcohol flavor, too. As with most beers, this beer improves quite a lot as it warms. The strange hoisin/soy sauce flavors go away, the alcohol flavor turns primarily to just warmth, and the desired flavors shine through more.
The rum isn't as huge as I was expecting, which for me, I guess is a good thing -- nice balance here. I get a lot of coffee in the flavor more than cacao, vanilla, or oak (the latter from the barrels), but all of the flavors are there in some fashion. Unfortunately, I don't feel any peppery heat at all from the peppers... there may be the slightest hint of warmth when the beer is approaching room temperature, but for all I know, that's the booze. There's a super subtle pepper flavor on the back end as well, but the heat overall isn't as apparent as it is in regular Bomb!
A no-doubt delicious beer and a must try, but I just don't prefer it to Bomb! ... the rum is a nice little change up, but I don't think the barrel aging makes this a better beer, at least in rum barrels. 1,515 charactersSerialTicker, Apr 23, 2016

A: Pours a bit thin. Pitch black with a slight off-brown head.
S: Huge chocolate notes up front, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, cacao. Some sweet cinnamon, vanilla and spicy notes from the rum barrels as well.
T: More chocolate in the flavor, vanilla, cinnamon. Not a ton of chile flavor, but you get some spice for sure. 
M: One of the more boozy beers I've had in a while. Big spicy alcohol notes up front, likely from the rum barrels. Finishes even spicier. 
O: Rum barrels are tough to work with, and I can see why they're not used too often. Rarely, I've seen it pulled off (BourbRum Plead the 5th). Here, I think it's more of a nuisance to the great base beer than a fresh idea. You're taking an already spiced stout, and adding it to a spiced barrel. Not good. The aroma starts nice, with loads of chocolate and cacao, but it fades quickly as you take your first sip. The coffee is really nowhere to be seen. Also, regular BA Bomb! is near 11%, but this one is at 14%, and I have no idea while. It really makes for an overly spicy and boozy beer. I can see some people preferring this to BA Bomb! or Bomb!, but not me. Too hot.
Recommendation: Probably worth a try if you have any interest in rum barrels, or you're a fan of the Bomb! series. 1,396 charactersSparty1224, Apr 19, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Serving Type: Bottle (March 2016 Version)
Consumed: 4.14.16
A: 4.5 This one doesn’t look all that thick, but it pours clear and almost black with a small, light tan head.
S: 4.5 Immediately after pouring, there’s a really nice chocolate cake, fudge aroma coming out of the glass, separating it from regular bomb. Like regular bomb, there’s also pretty strong vanilla, coffee, and chile. The rum barrel treatment doesn’t seem to add a distinct rum quality, but sort of adds a sweetness and richness that’s lacking in the regular version. 
T: 4.5 Flavors start off nice a sweet with good roasted malt, chocolate cake, and vanilla. Pretty quickly the coffee flavors, which are only decent in my opinion, kick in adding a light bitterness to counter the sweeter flavors. The finish is long and drawn out with a slowly building heat from the chiles; the gradual burn is terrific.
M: 4.5 Classic imperial stout feel. Good, substantial body with low, but steady carbonation.
O: 4.5 I’m not a huge fan of regular bomb as I think it’s a little clunky and don’t care for the coffee Prairie uses. This, however, is pretty delicious. The rum barrel doesn’t have big presence, but it does enough to round everything else out. This, coupled with a stronger yet still subtle chile flavor, takes this beer from pretty good to excellent. 1,343 charactersTele, Apr 15, 2016

It looks like used motor oil, smells like cocoa, tastes wonderful, and has just the right thickness to tantalize and linger. I'm not quite sure how the rum plays, but it bolsters the flavor without overpowering. 387 charactersimstimpy, Apr 14, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I'd like to really contribute to the Beer Advocate community by rating a beer that so few people have rated. With that, here goes a review that is identical to the consensus. 2016 vintage in an Avery Rare Beer Snifter, like you do.
Sight: Rich mahogany. 
Aroma: It smells like a coffee and brown sugar dry rub on a smoked rib. Oaky molasses and cherry smoked wood.
Taste: Starts out tasting like those chocolate-covered cherry candies your grandmother gave you after christmas dinner. Then it moves into a rich flourless chocolate cake with a powdered cacao and candied rum glaze. The finish is long and chewy. It resembles eating molasses flavored toffee after smoking a cigar. 
Mouthfeel: Coarse. Have you ever licked the inside of a rum barrel? I have. And it has the same mouthfeel as this.
Handfeel: Started out cool to the touch but I lovingly cupped the cup until it was luke warm.
Sound: The beer has a remarkably gentle sparkle and crackle in the glass. The bottle top popped off with a perfect hiss. 
Recommendation: Bring this beer to a beer share to show all your friends that you ain't no slacker and can bring the heat when it counts. When you get there, take one sip out of the bottle before anyone gets to try it and pour the rest down the drain after saying something along the lines of "I've had better".  
Trade value: If this beer were a currency, it would be the Euro. Not quite worth what it once was, but is still widely accepted everywhere. 
Salute Prairie, for giving everyone what we wanted all along... The same booze cocktail that everyone else is making but done in a way that makes it your own. 1,633 charactersBrotherDylan, Apr 12, 2016

A- Pours a fully opaque black color with no head, just a paper-thin ring around the edge of the glass and nearly no surface foam.  Non-resilient lacing leaves tiny clots behind.
S- Heavenly fudgy coffee aroma with a shot of boozy barrel for good measure.
T- Heavy roasted coffee at first, then dark chocolate fudge and powerful oaky rum barrel that works in  tandem with the vanilla to provide a great balancing sweetness.  A bit of green pepper aftertaste from the chilies.
M- Creamy and silky smooth with low carbonation and a full body. 
O- So much better than BA Bomb! It's probably due to BA Bomb! having a different base beer while this is actually Bomb! aged on rum barrels.  So much coffee and so much chocolate tied together with excellent rum barrel character.  Just lovely. 860 charactersImmortale25, Apr 07, 2016

S - big chocolate, caramel, coconut, vanilla, oak, sweet rum, cocoa, molasses, very smooth and sweet
T - follows the nose, big caramel, molasses, chocolate, coconut, oak, sweet dark rum, oak, vanilla, creamy
M - not thin bodied on the mouthfeel, alcohol covered, aftertaste is rum, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak
O - an interesting taste, like a great bba stout, but not. Sweeter, more coconut I think. Definitely a heavy rum influence. 546 charactersHopHunter19, Apr 07, 2016

Poured in a snifter, little to no tan head and near pitch body.  Aroma is super complex.  Big chocolate up front, fudgy, with vanilla, coffee and after it warmed a little the chiles were evident.  Taste is equally complex.  Fudge/cocoa at first then some coffee, rum barrel is subtle to me and some heat on the finish.  I love this beer and PAA makes some of my favorite stouts, add this to the list. 468 charactersdrew42e, Apr 03, 2016

4.37/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Fresh 2016 bottle. 14% abv. This is just a couple weeks old, and will almost certainly benefit from from aging. Maybe just a couple months. Regardless, as the glass had a few minutes to breathe the booziness settled down and the spicy stout characters came out. 
Look is thick, dark black with beautiful shine. Thin dark tan head dissipates to a thin ring with no lacing. 
Smell is ridiculously complex. The chocolate/vanilla flavors show first with coffee notes, spices come out later. The boozy notes hit and linger, but the beer has enough to overpower it. 
Taste is just like the nose, except you add what is undeniably rum flavors. Rum soaked brownie with some chili. It's tasty, but this fresh there is nothing but sipping for this behemoth. 
Body is thinner than standard Bomb.  Very oily and sticky, no carbonation, probably a notch below the base beer. I think the booze would blend better if there was more body. 
Overall, this is a big ass beer. Bomb is one of my favorites, and I think the standard form is better, but this is a fun beer to enjoy. It's not as drinkable as the base or even the BA version, but it's got a ton of flavors and aromas and they all work, albeit not for the faint of heart. 1,217 charactersGreatStoutman, Apr 03, 2016
4.73/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Looks black and rich, mocha-tan head, lacing. 
Smells like cocoa and vanilla, with a hint of roasted coffee. 
This tastes like a delicious milk-chocolatey m, char-roasty rum barrel-aged stout, with the chiles standing apart from the rum burn so as not to muddle things.
It's rich and creamy, and a bit sticky. 
Overall the impression I got was that of a beer superior to their regular Bomb!, as well as their barrel-aged version. 429 charactersTBoneJones, Apr 03, 2016

Doubly excited to have landed a bottle of this from the local beer store. "Imperial stout aged in rum barrels with coffee, cacao nibs, vanilla beans, and chilles added".
Poured to a Big Eddy snifter glass.
A - Pours a thick dark black brown; opaque in the glass, with a light quarter inch skimming of dark mocha that falls to a ring. A thick viscous looking liquid, minor sticky lacing falls right back down into the glass.
S - Oh yes, this is what it's all about. A gooey fudgey aroma - tons of chocolate cake, minor alcohol fumes. Brought back memories of having one of my first bottles of Bourbon County.  A beautiful intoxicating aroma.
T - Taste is the same: truly magnificent: fresh steeped coffee flavor right off the bat, chocolatey, fudgey, creamy, bourbon-y (despite being aged in rum barrels), and a beautiful earthy / vegetal / slightly spicy chili pepper presence on the finish.  The chili flavor is hot and spicy, slightly peppery, but never becomes too overbearing. All of the flavors meld together beautifully.
M - Smooth, silky, & creamy.  Exceptional drinking, especially considering the high abv.
Overall, a beautiful rum barrel aged beer.  Highly recommended stuff.

Mouthfeel:  Full-body and luscious 
Overall:  Incredibly decadent....  So glad I had the chance to have this.  So very rich in flavor and mouthfeel.  Its practically a liquid rum-chocolate cake.

4.35/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Typical oily stout look. Minimal head, minimal lacing, but the legs look thick. Leaves a ring of bubbles around the edge. The legs make it look boozy, but otherwise, to be honest, it looks like a run-of-the-mill stout.
But the smell... wow. Clearly not your average stout. Boozy for sure, but the coffee smell is more pronounced than in regular Bomb. Plenty of chocolate and vanilla. The chili peppers are not detectable on the nose. It's probably getting buried in the super-sweet, boozy, oaky, dessert smell. It's like smelling some kind of rum-soaked chocolate cake. Fantastic.
The chili peppers may not be on the nose, but they are clearly present when taking a sip. There is a peppery burn on the finish. Surprisingly, the pepper finish seems *stronger* than with regular Bomb. Tons of rum, chocolate, and vanilla in the flavor, but not as much coffee. The coffee does provide a bit of earthy bitterness in the background, but it's nice and subtle. The chili peppers had a real bite on the first few sips, but the more I drink it, the more the sweet, boozy rum, vanilla, and chocolate are overpowering the spice and the coffee.
Mouthfeel has the same slickness and smoothness as regular Bomb. However, this one comes across feeling slightly thinner. Or maybe it seems that way because the alcohol content in Pirate Bomb is not hidden at all. On the contrary, it's booze in your face.
Overall: Oh hell yes. This is a sweet, sticky, boozy, rum-soaked chocolatey dessert mess, but I mean than in the best way possible. It does not have the same balance or subtlety as regular Bomb, but who cares? It's so enjoyable in its own right. And that smell! Wow. 1,655 charactersccg, Mar 31, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52016 version - 12 ounce bottle poured into a 12 ounce tulip.  Vigorous pour directly into the center of the bottle created no head and there is no lacing.  The beer is dark brown/black.  Smell is dark chocolate and rum with a hint of vanilla.  Chocolate is very strong.  The mouthfeel is very smooth, almost oily, with low carbonation, but it's appropriate for the beer and adds to it.  This is 14% abv but there is almost no hint of it on the smell or taste initially. It is  dangerously smooth.  The alcohol becomes more prominent as the beer warms.  The taste is strong, dark chocolate, almost baking chocolate with rum.  The vanilla comes through on the back end.  There is a chili heat at the end that lingers long after, changing the overall taste/feel of the beer.  There is also a slight coffee aftertaste.  The heat is what sticks and that may be partly because of the high abv.  What carbonation is there brings out the chili flavor.  Overall this is an outstanding beer.  If I had any complaint it would be to make the chili flavor a little more subdued, but that wasn't enough to hurt the rating.  The balance in this is amazing, much better than in Barrel Aged BOMB!  No one flavor tends to overpower, although dark chocolate is the strongest.  I will search out this beer every year they make it. 1,310 charactersjvgoor3786, Mar 30, 2016
4.9/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Searched all around Houston for a few of these. Knew it was gonna be epic.
Look is jet black, with minimal light brown head. Very very slight red hue in the light. Doesn't appear to be too thick. Moderate lacing.
Smell is awesome. Definitely getting a lot of flavors reminiscent of regular Bomb. Slight chilli upfront with that big milk chocolate sweetness. Then you get the slight wood/oak of the barrels and a nice subtle rum presence. Vanilla is creeping through as well. 
Taste is similar to regular Bomb with more complexity. Milk chocolate and fudge upfront. As it warms up, the oakiness of the barrel creeps through with a hint of rum. Warming this up even more the heat of the chilie comes through. All these flavors linger around for a while.
Overall this is definitely the best barrel aged Bomb variant. Light years ahead of BA Bomb. I wouldn't say this is better than Pirate Noir, but both have similar tastes, with Pirate Noir being a little more thick and oily. Just when you think regular Bomb can't be beat this comes through. Fantastic beer 1,060 charactersMateo2699, Mar 30, 2016

4.88/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass (2016 version).
Appearance is deep dark brown in color with little head. 
Smell is rum, vanilla, chocolate and a hint of spice and dark fruit.
Taste is dark chocolate and vanilla up front with some rum coming through on the finish. The flavors linger for a good 10-20 sec. The chillies and coffee are faint but some dark fruit flavors (plum, black cherry) add good flavor. The sweetness is fairly noticeable, but the finish is fairly dry with a nice bite. The alcohol is perfectly placed.  
Mouthfeel is thick, chewy and creamy (silky) with a little heat on the end. The carbonation is low to moderate but works well throughout.
Overall this is an outstanding stout, and the rum is a perfect addition to the base beer. The chocolate notes are really well executed. All of the flavors work well together and pack quite a punch. Exceptional beer and I recommend drinking it fresh. 931 charactersthatche2, Mar 29, 2016

Taste is basically regular Bomb! with a strong rum barrel presence. Coffee is somewhat subdued in this one and the chocolate steps forward to accentuate the rum.
All in all, a VERY tasty brew. Perhaps the front runner of the BOMB! series.
If you ever get the chance to pick up 1 or even more, give yourself a treat and pick it up. Don't pass it by because it might cost a dollar or two more than something else.
I rated it a 4.5 and would probably go even higher if I reviewed it. 532 charactersheysuz, Mar 27, 2016

First whiff out of the opened bottle is a lot of chocolate. Appearance is just like any imperial stout, super black and a minimal head. Aroma is  rum, vanilla, rum, and chocolate. The flavor has just a touch of chilies, chocolate, vanilla, and rum. Overall it is alright but I think the bourbon barrel works much better with this beer. 445 charactersArrogantB, Mar 26, 2016

S - Rum, wood, dark chocolate/fudge, coffee.
T - Chocolate brownie, caramel, vanilla icing, rum, subtle coffee, warming pepper heat.
M - Creamy, velvety, sticky, smooth.
O - Outstanding. A rum-soaked brownie in liquid form. An assortment of flavors that work extremely well together. What 14%? Expensive, but worth the experience. 520 charactersKRubes, Mar 25, 2016
5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5In some ways I enjoy this better than the original. There is very little carbonation even with an aggressive pour (a little brief fizzle). The rum barrel really came out in this as it almost tasted like a smooth rum at 14% abv. These are hard to find but I enjoyed this loot during another Fischman's escapade. 310 charactersTrevor11, Mar 25, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured 2016 version into a snifter; comes out rich dark brown with little head but lots of lacing. Real pretty beer to look at and swirl in a glass. Smells a lot like regular bomb--chocolate, vanilla, wood, roast, booze, hint of chili spice. Taste is vanilla, sipping chocolate, and chili with nicely balanced rum / sugar finish. There's a bit more alcohol heat to this one than regular bomb imo and less coffee. Mouth is creamy, smooth, and silky smooth. 
This is a great beer and its undoubtedly the best rum barrel beer I've ever had. Not sure I like it more than regular bomb, but that's by no means a criticism. Look forward to sitting on one a bit. 655 charactersAppaZappa, Mar 24, 2016

Black in color with very little edges of tan when held to the light.  The smell is of bitter dark chocolate.  The taste is the same chocolate, but a faint hint of chilies comes through in the finish.  The body is good and full.  The alcohol is well hidden for 14%, but you know it's there once you put down the glass. 395 charactersphishgator, Mar 23, 2016

S:  Lots of chocolate fudge on the nose with vanilla and a hint of caramel and rum.
T:  Fudge up front here as well with vanilla, burnt sugar, oak, and a decent bit of rum following.  There are subtle cinnamon and spice notes as well.  The finish is moderately boozy, but not as strong as you would expect for its abv. Delicious.
M:  Thick body with low carbonation, this beer is thick and chewy with an alcohol presence that keeps it from being watery.
O:  A damn good beer, overall.  Love the aroma and flavor profile.  It could be a little smoother with the alcohol presence, but that's about the only nitpick I have with it. 725 charactersn2185, Mar 18, 2016

4.26/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25A - A brown-black purely opaque body and a brown head that pours short and fades to a slim ring and a slight spotty cast.  You can see the viscosity in the way the beer forms waves in the pour.  Promises a real creamy treat.
S - Vanilla and alcohol warmth, a hint of chili, also a definite chocolate thread.
T - The chili note is front, not so much as spice but hinting at pepper flesh.  Not off-note, like green peppers, but more like jalapenos.  Underlying this, and coming forward in the middle and close is a strong chocolate hit, spiced hints of cinnamon.  The rum comes through with vanilla and warmth.  The close fades quickly to a subtle but not overpowering sweetness.
M - This is the most surprising aspect.  A beer this big and full should be heavy, and it would not be a knock.  But this is surprisingly drinkable and pleasant.  There is not much spicy warmth, and not a lot of heat from the alcohol, either.  Exceptional.
O - Overall, I am not a huge fan of peppers in my beer, but this one is not brutal.  The flavor is very deep, but it is the feel in the mouth that really separates this brew from other big ABV stouts.  I cannot say I'd seek this out again, but it is not because this beer is anything other than top notch. 1,244 charactersTsar_Riga, Jan 30, 2016

Smell:  Spicy warm aroma, or you could say spicy hot.  Well, it smell more like a biting hot.  Wood and booze are apparent in the smell.  Sweet dark grains are there, but they are in back of the spice and booze. 
Taste:  This is definitely aged in rum barrels.  The sweetness in the rum is right there.  The rum barrel takes over the front end.  Just put the Bomb right behind all of this.  Good stuff.
Feel:  Big and heavy.  Creamy-ish.  Not bad at all.  
Overall - I think the rum barrel takes over this beer.  It makes it sweeter and changes it up significantly.  I actually like the regular Bomb better. 792 charactersmabermud, Dec 18, 2015

This one stood out to me a bit more than the bomb, although the nose in the bomb really shined. The taste of the Pirate bomb was much better.

A - Thick black pour with a thin halo of dark mocha head.

T - Smooth dark chocolate, charred wood, pumpernickel bread, molasses, and a touch of burnt brown sugar.

Taste is roasted coffee, a little bit of rum, and some heat (probably both from the chilies and from the rum).  I clearly held on to this bottle for too long and it's probably less than a month away from degenerating into a soy sauce bomb.  Original bottle I had blended the sweetness from the rum perfectly with the coffee, chocolate, and chilies in Bomb! 438 charactersOmahaKF, Nov 20, 2015

EDIT 6/2/16:  had latest release.  much better fresh.  mouthfeel seemed much fuller than the base beer.  i'd def go through the trouble of acquiring this again. 512 charactersvon_kaiser, Oct 05, 2015

Rum is one of my favorite spirits, and love how it complements sweeter beers. This one really had me excited for these reasons, but was slightly let down. The rum takes over and adds some pleasant sweetness, but makes the chocolate dominate from the base beer. Peppers are all but gone, and, surprisingly, vanilla very muted. I much prefer the base beer and will not be seeking this one out again. 472 charactersKSOZE, Sep 10, 2015

(A)- Pitch black with some good brown colored froth. Surprising retention and lacing for a 14% beer
(S)- Big and rich raisin and chocolate notes that flow into some serious rum barrel and vanilla bits. Some of the chili on the finish
(T)- Very similar to the smell. Big on the cocoa, vanilla, rum. The chilies are still on the finish, giving it some heat
(M)- A good carbonation level for the style. Big flavors with that spicy kick on the finish. Surprisingly smooth for 14% but that chili pepper at the end helps to remind you.
(O)- A great base, but I would of liked the chili to be better integrated into the beer. Having it at the tail end on the finish, really adds some heat to this that made this a challenge to finish 760 characterssweemzander, Sep 07, 2015

A: Black, like a sharks eyes...You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. Thats how dark this was. 
S: If you know what you're in for, and you like peppers and chocolate and vanilla, its got all that and more, just in your face and delicious. 
T: Agree with those who said you get more rum than on the nose. Really loved the rum finish. Glad there wasnt too much heat from the peppers, but just enough to keep it interesting. 
F: Mostly smooth, a little carbonation, not too heavy, not too light. 
O: I stayed away for awhile when I saw it was 14% but it hides that really well. Enjoyed it immensely. 
Anyways, this bomb delivered. 780 charactersMbo108, Aug 27, 2015

S: bakers chocolate, fudge, coffee, vanilla, and rum dominate in balance; vanilla is most prominent. Some oak as well. Like a fudgy chocolate rum ball. 
T: same as the nose, with the taste and warmth (but not overt heat) from the chilis. Extremely well balanced. The more I sip it, the more the chili dominates. 
F: heavy, but not as thick as I like for RIS. Nice wants from the chili in the finish and linger. Can't taste the alcohol, though the chili may me covering its warmth 
O: excellent. 547 charactersMissSmisje, Jun 13, 2015

a - brew pours a silky black w a thin dark brown cap that didn't hang and left no lace. deep and fudgey look.
s - nose has a really nice vanilla and rum heavy glaze over the stout base. a hint of spicy heat on the tail of the scene.  coffee is need in the medley of flavors.
t/m/o - lots going on here, and lots of good. big chocolatey stout with subtle notes of coffee and roast doused with some spicy heat and the soaked in rum with a big blast of vanilla. it's all there...and it's all great. Neal in a glass. very well done beer. 604 characterscosmicevan, Jun 10, 2015

Bottle to Prairie Teku
12oz
Batch 2 with no wax.
App- A solid dark brown color with no transperency with a nice 1-1/2" slightly darker brown head that faded pretty quickly. The beer was deep and dense and poured like chocolate.
Smell- Right out of the bottle, I mostly get the cacao and the vanilla. Big rich notes of rum come wofting up. As with base Bomb! Malty and rich like a milkshake. As it warmed more of the chili aroma came out as well. A nice mix. One doesnt overpower the other and you cant detect the nuances.
Taste- This was a very flavorful and layered and detectably smooth stout as was base Bomb! This was just better. I had a couple others with Chilis and it was too harse. The balance here of the ingredients is quite nice. The sweet of the vanilla and the change to the richness of the chocolate and then the subtle hints of spice was nice.
Mouth- A solid medium body, bordered on being a thicker beer but struck the balance nicely. The carbonation was a solid medium and was a bit bubbly and creamy.
Drink- A very good beer. I enjoyed it a lot. I was glad I was able to land at least one to review and enjoy this one. Prairie does some good things. I am happy to have some goodies in the fridge to try. 1,249 charactersFosterJM, May 21, 2015

Pours black with a brown head which is soapy on top and shimmering on the bottom. Smells of rich dark cocoa, vanilla, coffee, and rum. Tastes mostly like bittersweet cocoa which actually contrasts very well with a somewhat spicy pepper finish. Subtle vanilla, coffee, and rum flavors throughout. Both sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel is decadent and fits the style perfectly. Overall, the excellent flavor contrast makes this spicy chocolate stout amazing. 519 charactersalarmclock314, May 14, 2015

The trend these days is to barrel age everything, but sometimes, the barrel aging actually takes away from the base beer. 
Overall, this beer is not as good as BCBS or Bell's, and given the choice, I would take Bomb! over Pirate Bomb! 351 charactersrodmanfor3, Apr 19, 2015

A- Black with a two finger mocha head.
S- Chili peppers, rich creamy chocolate, hints of coffee, some vanilla, rum, some dark fruits, just really in your face and amazing.
T- Wow, this is intense and amazing, a lot more rum than the nose.  Sweet rum, hints of oak, coffee, rich creamy chocolate, some vanilla, faint chillies, low heat.
M- Smooth, full body.
O- Really well done, better than regular Bomb! which is great.  Truly worth seeking out, it is nicely balanced and the alcohol is well hidden. 579 characterslarryi86, Mar 01, 2015

4.89/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Espresso black w/ a clingy brown sugar ring of foam.
Smell: Rum barrel. OLD rum barrel. Medium roast coffee, vanilla, smoked cayenne, dark husky malt. Chocolate milk, dulce de leche as it warms.
Taste: Like a sweet aged demerara rum. Lightly roasted coffee, cocoa powder, dates, vanilla. FInishes with cayenne kick and clean smoky notes.
Mouthfeel: Light carbonation, viscous mouthfeel that is balanced by a spicy smoky finish. In one man's opinion, hides it's ABV very well despite the notable presence of rum. 526 charactersAmaeda27, Feb 03, 2015

4.9/5  rDev +9.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is an exceptional beer. It is possibly a 100 beer in my opinion except it lacks in a couple of areas. 
Appearance: Dark as night, not much head at all, pretty much what you would expect from this style of beer. A thin ring around the base of the beer of a mild foam.
Aroma: Coffee, charred malts, chocolate, rum, some dark fruits. Very complex. Not as earthy as standard Bomb, but I imagine the rum barrel takes that away. 
Taste: This is a wonderful beer, maintains the base very well. Nearly perfect in every way, maybe it is the perfectly rum barrel aged beer, but I have had others that have had more of the rum character come to the forefront and for that I am taking off the smallest of points. Its really insignificant, but I feel like I am doing too many 5's lately, not that this one doesn't deserve it, but if I could find a flaw that is it. The rum does not shine as much as I would like in the taste. For good or bad you decide its worldclass no doubt. The other thing I should say, is this has one of the best mouthfeel's and texture of beers I have ever had. It is amazing how perfectly balanced this beer is on the way it feels in the mouth. 
Overall: Worldclass beer, everyone knows it, probably the best rum aged beer I have had, No. I know it is! 1,273 charactershumuloner22, Feb 02, 2015

Taste - Chocolate syrup is accompanied by mild spice, vanilla, tobbacco and a warm rum finish. Little alcohol bite is noted in the finish. 
Mouthfeel - With the impression of chocolate syrup comes the stickiness in the mouthfeel. The chocolate and rum linger. 
Overall - This is a dessert beer. It is a great beer in a snowy winter night. 501 charactersJohnnyHopps, Feb 01, 2015

Smell-wow. super complex, burned sugar,coffee, dark chocolate, the rum comes through in the form of vanilla, tobacco, and pure sweetness.
Taste-like the smell, blown away by the complexity. Flavor is a harmonious blend of burned sugar, chocolate,mild coffee, dark fruit, vanilla comes through in the end, the rum sweetness gives all the flavors a boost without being remotely overpowering. the abv is all but missing.
Feel-oily yet the body is not too heavy, no carbonation at all.
Overall-wow.wow.wow is all i can say, so delicious and complex yet not to heavy and drinks absurdly smooth, this one could get you in trouble. 832 charactersSteveB24, Jan 27, 2015

BOTTLE: 12 fl oz. Brown glass. Branded black pry-off pressure cap. Appealing label art.
Served cold into a pilsner glass and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. 14% ABV. Reviewed live as a rum barrel aged imperial stout per the label. Distributed by the Shelton Bastards.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: Quarter finger wide. Rich tan colour. Has a roasty mocha-like consistency with wonderful creaminess and a nice supple character to it. Aptly full and thick. Unfortunately, the retention is maybe 1 minute at best - but that's forgivable at 14% ABV. Leaves no lacing as it recedes.
BODY: Opaque solid jet-black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
Appears aptly carbonated. This is how an imperial stout should look - it's fantastic. I do wish the head retained longer and had more width to it, but this is one of the better imperial stout appearances I've seen in some time.
AROMA: Intricate, and different from the usual bourbon barrel characteristics I'm accustomed to. It has the requisite dark and chocolate malts, but never seems too sweet. The rum does jump out, though I don't know that I get sugarcane or any unrefined sugars per se - more a vanilla and coconut character, though of course the beer also has vanilla bean notes, so it's hard to distinguish. But boy is the vanilla authentic; I definitely pick up on legitimate vanilla bean. This isn't the artificial vanillin aroma of lesser vanilla stouts. Cacao nibs are there, but it's a subtle presence. When I look, I do find the chillies - but they don't evoke much spice or heat; it's more a neutral roasted ancho note.
That leaves the coffee...but where is the coffee? Nowhere to be found, strangely.
What really stands out is an unexpected lightly caramelized walnut note, which really works here. The chocolate gets better and better as it warms. More of a roasted barley presence would really set it off.
The rum barrel just melts into the base, but there's never any booziness. I hope Avery's brewers are taking notes...this is how rum should be incorporated.
No yeast character, hop notes, or off-notes are detectable.
TASTE: Impeccably balanced, with an excellent imperial stout build. The chocolate malt and dark malt backbone is wonderful, lending just enough malty sweetness without going overboard. The cacao nibs play on the chocolate malt, coaxing out more nuanced milk, dark, and unrefined chocolate notes. The unrefined chocolate in particular combined with the very subtle chilli pepper presence gives it a wonderful Mexican chocolate stout vibe; there's not a whole lot of heat - just enough to maintain the careful harmony of flavour presence throughout.
It gets even better; the genuine vanilla bean is mind-blowing, and the rum barrel character is so seamlessly integrated into the base that I can't determine where the vanilla bean stops and the coconut-y rum barrel character ends. There's no real oak or wood barrel presence per se, but rum is nicely showcased.
I can't find any coffee. More of a roasted barley presence would help accentuate the  chilli pepper roastiness.
As it warms, I try to find that walnut, but get only a faint wisp of it. What does emerge is fudge, as well as some unexpected cinnamon - which plays well with the Mexican chocolate characteristics. It has very subtle burnt characteristics.
This is one of the most subtly executed and intricate imperial stouts in the Southwest region, if not THE most. I'm loving every sip, and it only develops further as it comes to temperature. I love the way the chilli pepper plays with the chocolate, and the chili heat comes to fruition as it warms in a way I'm not sure I've really experienced before in a beer. Just terrific.
TEXTURE: Creamy and soft, with a near perfect subtle coarseness on the palate - which helps coax a bit more depth of flavour out of the taste. It's similarly near perfectly dry for a stout. Roasted barley would help dial in the coarseness and dryness. It's aptly full-bodied, with ideal thickness and weight on the palate. Overall presence on the palate is outstanding. This texture elevates the beer, and teases out nuances from the taste. Really incredibly well-executed, with no obvious flaws (e.g. an oily or scratchy feel).
OVERALL: She's a sipper sure, but if you drank her side by side with a 10% imperial stout, I doubt you could notice the difference. I already want more. This is a treat of an imperial stout with some of the best rum barrel integration I've come across. Further testament to the incredible quality of Prairie's imperial stouts. Perhaps the best of the Bomb series. I'd absolutely buy it again and would recommend it to friends and trade partners. It might even be Prairie's best beer, and that's saying a lot. I tip my hat to the brewers; this is an achievement.

A- Pours like motor oil just about as much as a beer can. A dark tan cap makes it up to a finger with a foamy texture. Decent retention results in a medium ring that fails to leave much lace.
S- Insanity roast reminiscent of regular Bomb; just a massive amount of burnt grains and dark roast coffee. Coffee probably the most prominent thing to me with cocoa, charred barley, toasty chiles and some dark fruit spice from rum. Barrel very quiet overall.
T- Gains some complexity here as more elements of the brew day seem to come to life. Roast coffee like French or Italian roast with burnt barley followed by earthy cocoa, toasty chile flesh, vanilla bean sweetness and slight rum. The barrel hints with brown sugar, dark fruit, wet oak tannin and spice.
MF-  Thick and oily body overall. Slick and foamy as well as a tad creamy. Carbonation at a medium level with a tiny hint of chile heat and alcohol warming on the back end.
Not as much Pirate as I would expect and honestly very similar to the regular Bomb! That being said what barrel flavors there are work nicely with the intense roasty base beer. 1,292 characterscbutova, Jan 16, 2015

4.53/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a Bruery snifter. The pour is very black and sports a thin finger of dark brown head that quickly dissolves down to a thin lace. Very aromatic beer. The nose has rich, pronounced notes of black coffee, rum, burnt sugar, and hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and chocolate. The rum and coffee nose on a beer is something totally new to me. I like it a lot.
Full body and a firm, oily feel. Very complex flavor. Roasted malt accented with vanilla greets you first, followed by intense espresso notes and a hint of cinnamon. At mid-palate, the rum barrels start to charge in with their sweet woody notes and molasses and burnt sugar richness. Chili peppers emerge only briefly on the back of the palate and are quickly washed away by a warming booziness that doesn't seem like 14%. Long and lingering finish with strong coffee and dark chocolate notes. The complexity forces you to sip and concentrate, which is a good thing considering the strength of this beer. Impressive.
This is the first beer I've had (to my knowledge) that was aged in rum barrels. The result is a unique beer experience. The rum adds an interesting dimension to this beer, complementing the coffee especially well and adding richness to the flavor. As with bourbon barrel-aging, sweetness as added as well, but it's not a creamy, vanilla-like sweetness. It's more of a burnt sugar and molasses sweetness. I really enjoyed this beer and wouldn't hesitate to try another rum barrel-aged beer, but I think I prefer the standard Bomb! (or Bible Belt) better. The vanilla and chilis are more pronounced and I tend to prefer those flavors to the rum-accented coffee flavors of Pirate Bomb. Nevertheless, this beer is definitely recommended and is not to be missed if the opportunity should arise. 1,784 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Jan 06, 2015

A- dark and thick with little noticeable carbonation.  Very light and short dark brown head.
S-  chocolate hit the nose first with a little expresso behind it.  Mild touch of vanilla and wood.  The peppers were there but mildly.  Not overwhelming but booze is present as well.  Although the booze was detectable I didn't get much of a rum presence.
T-  lots of chocolate and vanilla up front as well as well as coffee and expresso.  Some coconut from the rum I suppose but still no true rum flavoring.  Wood and a little
heat from the booze just about finish this one up right before the peppers lightly expose themselves in mostly flavor and not  much spice.
M-  full bodied and smooth as can be.  This is rich and creamy, barely any carbonation, and after a little warming up of its own, it's ready to warm you.
O-  a great job in this one.  I could go through these all winter.  Although I expected more rum, this is spot on for a delicious stout.  Amazingly smooth and the ABV is pretty hidden for what it is.  Highly enjoyable and recommended. 1,086 charactersEveningCordial, Dec 11, 2014

Aroma leaps out from the pour, with rum, chocolate, coffee, and peppers all making an early showing. Up close, coffee and chocolate dominate, with rum, vanilla, and peppers all in the background.
Every flavor from the aroma is present in the flavor. Chocolate and booze are forefront, with coffee providing a nice rounding out effect, and the heat from the peppers very noticeable on the back end.
Slightly thinner body than Bomb!, but still thick and creamy. Much hotter in feel.
The rum adds less than you might guess, if you're a  fan of Bomb!. It's remarkably similar overall, although the rum is definitely present in the alcohol heat, and a bit in the flavor. 776 charactersRoguer, Nov 30, 2014

Taste is vanilla and a short lasting burning sensation, fudge, chocolate and an earthy quality, the rum character is very faint and gives more so this oaky brown sugar side to the beer. This beer has literally zero alcohol taste, without drinking anything before, supersmooth with a very nice thick texture, only lacking a bit more taste. 410 characterssimont1, Nov 30, 2014

Coffee is the main aromatic note, followed by some chocolate/vanilla and a very mild touch of rum.  Rum was more apparent when straight from the fridge.  Really gets overwhelmed by everything else as it warms.  Chocolate makes a stronger appearance in the flavor with the coffee making a showing.  Again, rum is very subdued as it gets warmer.  Chile warmth in the throat.  Ashy bitterness.  Mouthfeel is full with a barely there carbonation.  Overall, this is good, but I'd like more rum barrel. 541 charactersgoochpunch, Nov 30, 2014

Flavor profile: Heavy dark chocolate and cocoa. The vanilla is apparent. The peppers stand out much more in this beer than brimstone bomb. Roasted malts and coffee. The rum flavors are noticeable and very unique. A much different oaky flavor. Some spice flavors. 
Full bodied and rich. The right amount of carbonation.

4.67/5  rDev +4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A little rusty on reviewing since the had function. 
A: single finger head dissipates quickly although leaves a thin layer of tan froth on a jet black body
S: lots of peanut butter dominates the nose. Additional notes include vanilla, chocolate, dark malts. Hasn't warmed up enough yet but as it does the barrel aging is more evident. The chiles aren't really there. The aroma is great but not what was expected or as advertised.
T: so after a few sips the rum barrels are well represented. I hope though as I enjoyed this one it would balance out. This one is definitly complex. Early on the barrel is best but as it's enjoyed the chocolate, vanilla and dark malts appear briefly only to be eclipsed by the chile heat in the finish. Interestingly the chiles have more of a heat releasing role than that of the pepper itself. Nice although rapid transitions of flavor.
M: relatively thick and oily feel as expected. Very nice degree of carbonation. Just right 
Overall: certainly complex and worth the hype. I feel some other chile barrel aged stouts are more desirable than this but don't miss a chance to try it if you are lucky enough to do so. I feel fortunate to have had that opportunity. 1,199 characterskylehay2004, Nov 27, 2014

This is the best rum barrel-aged beer I've had yet, and it's because the rum is just subtle enough where it's detectable (as I believe rum flavors should be). The chili peppers are more prominent in this than all the regular Bomb! I've had in the past. I typically don't prefer too much pepper notes and spice in my brews, but I think it works with the sweetness that the rum barrels add. It's not that much better than the regular. It's just... different. 513 charactersRollzroyce21, Nov 26, 2014

For a 14 percent barrel - aged beer the alcohol is barely detectable. 265 charactersPowderhornphil, Nov 13, 2014

Poured into a Prairie Artisan Ales teku glass because beer definitely tastes better when the logo on the glass matches the liquid inside.
Appearance (4.0) - With a pretty aggressive pour, I'm just able to coax out a head that shows about three-fourths of a finger of thickness. I realize barrel-aged beers often have trouble with foam and retention (which is why I tend to pour them aggressively), but something about a wimpy layer of foam just takes the shine of a beer's look to me. The foam is a light sienna hue with hints of tawny, and it hangs around for just a bit before fading to leave a spotty tracing of film on the surface of the motor-oil black liquid. Lacing is nonexistent.
Smell (4.0) - I quickly realize that this beer is not meant to be consumed directly out of the fridge, because the chill has left an aroma that is predominantly rum--but in a boozy, hot way--and dulled chocolate. Many beers are less than ideal at cooler temperatures, and I will proceed to sip on it as it warms up, but this one is downright lacking at colder temps, so I decide to set it aside for a good 20 minutes, which turns out to be a very good decision. When I come back to it, the chocolate has now gained some depth, with richer, bittersweet tones, and the rum presence brings that quintessential spice element, with some boozy sweetness remaining. I don't get much vanilla or chile at this stage, unfortunately, but there is a nice roasted malt backbone supporting the chocolate and rum.
Taste (4.25) - The taste had the exact same "too cold" problem as the smell, resulting in something that tasted like stale chocolate-infused liquor. But as with the smell, time apart did make the heart grow fonder--or in this case, allowed the beer to warm up to my preferences. The chocolate became more rich, and had a light complement of sweet vanilla that I didn't pick up in the smell. The rum spice was present, but integrated into the other flavors in the beer, rather than just tasting like someone poured rum into a stout. But the most significant thing is the way the rum played with the chile aspect--subtle at first, almost unnoticeable, but as I continued to sip away, the heat became cumulative on my palate, slowly building an underlying spiciness that really kicked the beer up a notch. The only thing I wish is that there was a way for the rum to be more overt, but while still not being unbalanced. Perhaps I ask too much...
Feel (4.25) - On the low side of full-bodied, with a thick, viscous quality to it, but not as thick as some imperial stouts I've had (I'm guessing from the barrel aging). Carbonation is low and could use just a bit more punch to it. Finish is sweet and with a lingering heat, especially about halfway through the bottle.
Overall (4.25), I'm not sure I've had a more manic-depressive beer with such a stark contrast between the experience when cold vs. warm. As such, I don't think I'm even going to stick my other bottles of Pirate into the fridge before opening them, because this one got good just a bit before it hit true room temperature. I'm thinking cellar temp will be perfect. 3,253 charactersLambicPentameter, Nov 07, 2014

Because of the rum barrel, the chilies have been toned down, the coffee is a little more forward, and the ending has a slight sweetness to it...the barrel is pretty subtle as far as aging in rum goes...but I do prefer it to regular bomb!...but I have to say it isn't a huge improvement and might just go on preference 359 charactersTboneRN, Nov 04, 2014

Taste - Chocolate is the dominant flavor at first, closely followed by rum and the vanilla associated with it. There is a slight burn from the pepper at the end that sets this beer apart from others, besides other bomb variants. This beer tastes like heaven

4.4/5  rDev -2%Thank you very much for this one, Jason! Pours a dark brown, soon vanishing, bubbly head, which leaves small spots of lace, while mahogany in color, almost complete black.
The nose booms with coffee, bitter chocolate and dark caramel, supporting hints of vanilla, which are imparted by an oaken, smooth barrel influence, along with a distinct rum infusion.
Has an outstanding complexity, lots of tastes blend together within split-seconds. Begins with soft milk chocolate and toffee notes, heated up by a chili burn from the back of the palate. Bitterness reveals itself under the unfolding spiciness, part of due to the rum barrel, with a slick, almost dry, rich coffee character. This gets balanced by earthy malts, with lots of toffee and caramel qualities, leading to a vanilla note, which introduces the palate to the gentle, boozy rum barrel taste. Once the rum gets detectable it wraps up the whole palate by enhancing the full-bodied character of this brew, without overpowering any nuances. Both vanilla and chili interact for a long while, hovering above the deep, slightly roasted coffee bitterness with dark, sweetened choclate in the finish. Ends a bit sweeter, with chocolate fudge, chilis and wooden rum notes, which seem to be a perfect match, adding a warm, smooth impression to the beer, without revealing any alcoholic notes. Wow! 1,351 charactersaleigator, Oct 18, 2014

A. Dark brown nearly black with a very frothy head. The head slowly retreats to a fine bubble rim.
S. Complex.  Mocha frappacino, spiced rum, coconut, banana peels, coffee, and chocolate. 
T. The individual notes are appearant but mesh to a chocolate banana tropical taste.  Notes of chocolate, banana, coconut, pie crust, whipped cream, and coffee. No booze.
M. Very smooth - actually too smooth - full body, medium to low carbonation.
O. I very much enjoyed this beer. I wish had more. The bottom of the glass was a sad sight. Go get this. 590 charactersmacher0, Oct 13, 2014

Got this for $8.50 at the local store about a month ago.
a- Pours a super dark black. Brown head that quickly disappears into a foam ring. 3.5/5
s- Super fudge with a bold coffee presence. Hints of Rum, carmel and vanilla blend together. The nose has loads of chocolate. One of the best smelling beers I have ever had. 4.5/5
t- Waves of coffee and chocolate coat the tongue, and open up to more vanilla and carmel flavors as it sits on the palate. Very bold, yet nuanced and balanced. The alcohol warmth blends with the chili heat in the throat  with a noticeable lingering warmth 4.75/5
m- This is definitely a big bodied beer. The nice thick body complements the style perfectly. Low carbonation as you would expect 4.25/5
o-This is a fantastic beer. I would have to say that this is the best stout I have ever had. This stout has everything- A big nose that has a lot of complexity, big flavors that are balanced perfectly and perfect mouthfeel.I love how the chills hide the alcohol heat in the throat and have the lasting heat. Really lovely beer. Something you kind of have to drink on an empty stomach or half a bottle at a time. It is a meal in itself. I would recommend this, and personally I would pay up to $12 a bottle for it. IT is just that good. Must try. 4.75/5 1,303 charactersJustin8mypants, Oct 13, 2014

from The Party Source in KY, this imperial stout pours a thick black midnight with little to no
head.  The nose is HUGE and complex.  Rum mingles with coconut, chocolate, coffee, and of
all things chili peppers mixed with tones of heavy alcohol.  Flavors are outstanding.  Chocolate
and coffee flavors to the fore, coconut and rum to the aft, port and starboard show heavy
sweet malts and deep roasted grains.  Chili peppers shine through on the aftertaste giving an
added warmth to the alcohol heat.  An exceptional beer and one worth aging a few years if at
all possible.  Very nice.  Contributes to words like "arrgghh" and looking for "booty"....that is
IF she has more than one, then your treasure is found.  Plunder time!

4.11/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance-  Jet black color with a little bit of sediment visible.  Essentially produces no head on the pour, only some minor carbonation that leaves some foam around the edges of the glass.
Aroma-  Very nice aroma of vanilla, milk chocolate, molasses, and a little bit of coffee melded among all the sweet aromas.
Taste- Letting this warm up to 50 degrees before the first sip.  Initial impression is that rum barrels are very noticeable with sweet molasses, oak, and caramel flavors.  Very sweet in the front and warming alcohol making is presence known as well.  The finish is what really stands out though, with creamy vanilla and mild coffee flavors combining for a terrific finish capped off by a little bit of pepper spice.  
Feel-  On the lighter side of full bodied, which makes this a little dangerous to drink.  Decent amount of carbonation that becomes slightly noticeable in the middle of the mouth.  
Overall-  A really good beer, but for me it falls a bit short of expectations, which have been brought on by reviews and my experience with Prairies amazing arsenal of stouts.  Its just a tad too sweet for my liking and could use more roasted qualities to balance the front which is dominated by sweet rum flavors.  But as a rum lover I know the sweetness should shine through, so it really comes down to my roasted/coffee preference in stouts. Prairie aimed to make a rum barrel stout and they succeeded, but it just doesn't quite work for me. Despite my seemingly negative focus on this, I really enjoyed the beer (the finish is amazing) and I'd defnitely recommend it.  I just wouldn't give an arm and leg for it considering regular Bomb! can be gotten a lot easier. 1,689 charactersCTbrew32, Sep 28, 2014

From a bottle into a snifter. 
Green wax
BOMB aged in Rum barrels 
APPEARANCE: Muddy black pour yields a one finger, foamy, medium tan head with very good retention. Jet black body with almost no carbonation. Slowly fades to a full foam cap, then a wisp and ring. A simple ring remains but leaves no lacing down the glass. Less head and less carbonation than the base beer. 
SMELL: Everything from the regular BOMB is there plus a touch of rum. The adjuncts are slightly milder to make room for the rum though. A touch milder then, with coffee, cocoa, vanilla and chilies, with a bit of rum and oak as well. A touch milder than the base beer, but really, really wonderful. Love this. 
TASTE: Rum and vanilla notes up front. A touch of milk chocolate into the swallow with some chili heat as well. Bold and lingering finish of rum, oak, vanilla, some coconut, bitter coffee and cocoa nibs, as well as some well measured heat again. The rum barrels add a touch of spirit and coconut to the already complex base beer. This works really well. Delicious. 
PALATE: Similar to the base beer, but a bit lighter and less creamy. Medium body and slightly higher levels of carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine with a bit of a scratch at the swallow and finishes slightly mouth-coating. Less chili heat and booze, though still a touch too light and carbonated for the style. 
OVERALL: Excellent again. The rum barrel has kind of found room at the expense of some of the base beer, but it's excellently balanced and complex. This and the base beer make an absolutely wonderful pair; top class stuff in my books. Cheers Doodler. Highly recommended. 1,746 charactersJeffo, Jun 27, 2014

a - Pours a dark jet black color with one inch of dark tan head and low carbonation evident. Looks exactly like Bible Belt.
s - Smells of sweet rum, sweet milk chocolate, roasted malts, caramel malts, toffee, and vanilla. As it warms up some coffee but less than Bible Belt. Sweet vanilla and cream coming through more as it warms too. Awesome nose, the rum adds another nice complex note without dominating the other flavors.
t - Tastes of milk chocolate, sweet rum, oak, toasted malts, caramel, alcohol, dark chocolate, cocoa, cream, toffee, vanilla, coffee grinds, and earthy notes. Once again, no real chilis here and the rum is great. Best tasting of the three Prairie beers.
m - Medium body and low carbonation, light alcohol presence. Easy to drink, nice mouthfeel.
o - Overall I liked this one a lot, and found it to be the best of the three between Prairie Bomb, Bible Belt, and this. Less peppers than the other two, and the rum tastes great without dominating the other complex flavors. Everything works well together, would love to have it again. 1,220 charactersmdfb79, Jun 11, 2014

Pours a dark black, with a dark brown head, and a bit of lacing down the glass.
Smells very roasty, with lots of chocolate, coffee, some rum, and cinnamon.
Pirate Bomb! has a bit of a spiced cinnamon element to it that regular Bomb! didn't have. I don't think the beers are brewed with cinnamon, so this must be the rum element. There is a mild and pleasant alcoholic rum flavor to it that doesn't make the beer boozy whatsoever- only noticeable near the end of the each sip. The chocolate and coffee blast that Bomb! had is still in full force here, but not quite as potent. The barrel aging seems to have tamed it. I'm not really getting any pepper flavors here, the barrel aging must have smoothed that part way out. The coffee flavor is slightly bitter and nutty, a little bit sweet, while the chocolate is dark and rich, with some slight dark fruits flavors. There is a bit of creamy vanilla and oak flavors as well, ostensibly from the rum barrel aging. Just a very complex beer.
Medium to thick bodied, very creamy and rich mouthfeel. Goes down way too easy for a beer that's 14% ABV, it drinks like 7% ABV. Low carbonation.
Another winner from Prairie, this is an excellent barrel-aged stout. Rum barrels seem to be coming into vogue more, and I like it. 1,302 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 22, 2014

A- Pitch black as it slides into the glass. Creamy, faint, caramel colored head that settles in around the edge. Intense to say the least.
S- Consistent with the Bomb! aroma of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak, and chilies, but with the rum barrel spices added in. Lots of caramelized sugars. 
T- So. Freaking. Intense! Bomb forward with a rum twist on the backend. Waves of cocoa, tempering vanilla, charred sugar cane, and a touch of coconut. The chili peppers work only to compliment the bounty of flavors that flow together to near perfection.
M- Silky, full, creamy, low carbonation. Alcohol is so hidden for the abv. Damn near perfect.
O- Everyone wants to compare to the non-variant. And while I'm not 100% sure which is better, I know that this is so damn good. Rum barrel only intensifies it.

Ap - Black with a thin mocha head that settles to a ring. Little to no lacing. When I hold a light up to it, there is a bunch of sediment/floaties. Not very appealing, but when you're adding this many adjuncts, it's bound to happen. 
Ar - Sweet milk chocolate, subtle chili, rum, and vanilla. 
T - Similar to the nose, with a touch of coffee thrown in. I really want more heat with these beers. 
M - Chewy, thick, mouth-coating. There's almost no pepper, or alcohol burn really. 
O - This beer is REALLY tasty. However, this beer, I feel, would be one of the best ever if there was more heat and less coffee bitterness. I'm really glad I got to try this! 675 charactersKVNBGRY, May 12, 2014

Pours oil black with a thin eighth finger of deep tan head that remains only as a halo, leaving almost no lace. 
Pleasing aromas of vanilla, rum, milk chocolate, creamed coffee and a very subtle waft of chilli. Delightful and inviting. 
The taste doesn't follow the nose as much as blow it away. Bold and rich with coffee, sugary rum, cocoa, slight char, roasty malt, smooth vanilla, molasses, brown sugar and a nip of alcohol with more of a mild chilli flavor than any real heat. The smoothness and ease of consumption belie it's 14% abv. Excellent layers of flavor that really showcase the barrel and adjuncts alike in wave after wave of stout satisfaction. 
Fairly thick body; creamy and moderately heavy with tingly carbonation. The finish has the sweetness and a little booze heat from the rum with chocolate covered coffee beans and a very subtle chilli heat. 
I've had a couple back to back sub par experiences with Prairie's barreled stouts but this is truly outstanding. The rum barrel gives the base Bomb! a sugary candy coating that brings everything together fantastically. Highly recommended. 1,270 charactersThickNStout, May 09, 2014

Overall an extremely well done high abv stout. Barrel is lovely and rich but doesn't smack of rum yet hits all the right notes. Alcohol is well hidden. Smooth drinking, rich and luxurious, and not at all taxing. A far cry from both Noir and Bomb and a superior beer to those two in every way.

Just proves my point in an earlier thread as to why ratings need to be segregated in finer points less the .25. Had the Stone Go To IPA earlier and found it fabulous and as such gave it a 4.75. This beer, on the other hand was far superior in every way, shape & form but of I just gave it the same cursory rating, it would have been comparable. Just not so...Can't give it a perfect 5 but it's absolutely right up there with the best of the best...i.e. Bomb!, BCBS, etc. some of us are blessed with relatively easy access to great IIPA's like HT, Gandhi, Lawsons & others and others are blessed with finely crafted brews like the Prairie brands.

A - Pours dark with dark brown around the edge of the glass. One finger carmel mocha head
S - Roast, expresso, dark chocolates, rum, vanilla, and very trace amounts of pepper on the nose
T - Taste follows the smell with rich expresso hints on the front, with roasted walnuts, dark chocolate, vanilla followed by small amounts of barrel character and chile on the finish
M - Mouthfeel is very creamy full bodied and chewy. The mouthfeel is amazing on this beer and after it goes down, the heat lingers
O - A slight improvement on Bomb! They are both amazing beers, both of these are slightly better than bible belt 674 charactersdrmcleod10, Apr 21, 2014

A: Pours a coffee black, with minimal tan head which recedes quickly to a ring. Decent retention for what’s there, but no lacing.
S: Vanilla-infused chocolate candy is the dominant flavor, along with tobacco, a hint of cinnamon and coffee in the background.
T: Vanilla bean and rich milk chocolate, moderate amount of dark roast coffee, a little sweet red chili on the back end, with a long chocolate milk finish. 
M: Full bodied, bordering on thick, with light but sharp carbonation. Alcohol is mostly well hidden.
O: I don’t get a lot of rum per se, but this is tasty nonetheless. Good, rich chocolate and vanilla flavors. 645 characterspmarlowe, Apr 09, 2014

There’s an aroma of chocolate and toffee, which doesn’t do it justice. It smells great—like the finest of chocolates and toffees for your olfactory edification. The same thing with the taste, as each sip brings a taste of dark roast coffee from the finest of brews, along with the chocolate and toffee, smoothly blended together and belying hints of vanilla, toasted coconut, and a hint of caramelized sugar. 
This gives no indication of it’s strength—until you’ve sipped it a few times and feel the effects. That’s how smooth and well-blended it is. 
Worth seeking out. One to share but if you kept it to yourself I wouldn’t fault you one bit.

4.49/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5the rum adds a whole new layer to an already extravagantly complex brew. intense vanilla and woody spice, with traces of molasses and black pepper now blend into the chocolate chili whiskey complex, creating a beverage that is about as layered as they come, but without being overdone in any one area. i am most impressed by the softness of this, just totally delicate and pillowy on the palate, while maintaining enough carbonation to not get heavy. it hides its alcohol strength brilliantly, almost misleadingly, and shows only enough of the chili to intrigue me without sweating me out. i think that element is more balanced than the regular bomb, but some of its distinguishing uniqueness is gone. while this may be more refined, and is certainly just as delicious, i think it is closer to having peers than the original bomb, which is truly one of a kind. chocolate is subtle too in taste, but its aroma is robust. the rum, believe it or not, is a dominant flavor, in a way that the bourbon wasnt before, its almost too much, but because of the foreign feel of rum flavors on my palate, i like it this one time, but in the future that may become a critique of this beer for me. overall a world class phenomenal brew, a rarity unfortunately, everyone should be able to taste this! definitely one to share 1,308 charactersStonedTrippin, Apr 02, 2014

Aroma of light peppers notes with some very nice and rich black chocolate notes is just about perfect. Taste is a complex mix of rich black chocolates with some light pepper that are not overwhelming with some vanilla notes. Body is full with super nice creamy notes with medium carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Loads of complexity with great flavors and also some good complexity. World class stout for sure. 521 charactersPhyl21ca, Mar 29, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -5.3%Reviewing Pirate Bomb! from Prairie Artisan Ales out of Krebs, Oklahoma.
Score: 94
2012 vintage bottle served in a Kuhnhenn snifter and enjoyed on 12/30/13. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Murky black-brown in color. Pours a finger of tan head that settles to a thin ring around the glass. Not much lacing or retention. 4/5
Smell: Rum, vanilla, cacao, and coffee grounds. No chili pepper. A little booze. 4.5/5
Taste: Tastes just like it smells, with a prominent vanilla-forward rum flavor. Delicious mix of rum, chocolate, and vanilla here. Maybe a hint of chili pepper towards the finish, but there is virtually no coffee or chili pepper flavor here. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, light-plus carbonation. I wish this brew was a tad thicker with a touch less carbonation. Good balance, but sweet-leaning. Oily, slightly creamy mouthfeel. 3.5/5
Overall: A really nice beer that does not have as much nexus to the base beer as expected. The vanilla-y rum is done quite nicely.
Cost: $8 for a 12 oz bottle. 1,023 charactersjegross2, Feb 20, 2014

The aroma is lots chocolate brownie, dark chocolate, mocha and roasted coffee. Green chili skin. Vanilla.
The beer has a huge mouthfeel, towards Huna. In general, a huge note of big brownie chocolate, and dark chocolate throughout. In the front, there's also spicy alcohol, although not obviously rum. The heat is medium plus towards the back of the throat, although I wish it hit earlier on the palate.
A well built beer that is extremely thick and chocolately, which arguably is it's ever so slight downfall. I believe that cinnamon would help cut away from some of that, which this brew is missing. 661 charactersdar482, Feb 12, 2014

Typical big stout appearance. Near black with a thick, beige cap that leaves some sticky lacing around the snifter. Fabulous aroma. Coffee, roast, oak, booze. As expected / hoped, this is awesome. The rum character comes in late and while present, is another nuance rather than a dominant force. Creamy and smooth, yet bold and assertive. Beautifully blended and executed beer. Such balance and grace for such a huge abv beer. The folks at Prairie Artisan Ales truly have a good thing going. Wow. 568 charactersHuhzubendah, Jan 12, 2014

Pours the same as Prairie Bomb. Pitch black with a dark mocha head with moderate to low retention. Lacing is even more sparse but the legs are, if its possible, even thicker. Pretty nice.
The rum-barrel aging lends a completely different aroma to this brew. Nose is chocolate, cocoa, molasses, lactose, and cane sugar. Overall sweeter but it loses the robustness from the coffee.
Opens chocolate, molasses, honey and sweet dark fruit. More chocolate, fudge, and cocoa in the middle with hints of booze, oak, and leather at the end. Finishes dark fruit, espresso and cocoa with the same aftertaste. Nice complexity and a pretty unique flavor profile.
Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Thick, oily and chewy in the mouth and goes down warm and slick. Finishes messy with a lingering aftertaste. The barrels have done wonders for the feel, making it thicker and less carbonated. Very nice!
The rum-barrel aging fixes the biggest problem with this beer: the body. Thickening and smoothing it out. This is a pretty good beer and certainly better than the base. 1,196 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 04, 2014

It's all you get at first. Then comes some vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and tobacco. The taste is pretty boozy with loads of rum that are immediately rounded out by the chocolate and vanilla primarily. There is definitely some coffee bitterness in there as well. The body of the beer is just the right thickness. It is not quite motor oil, but it is pretty thick. Really enjoyed this sipper of a beer unlike anything else I've had. 528 charactersPHBoiler, Jan 02, 2014

A- Pours black with dark brown hues around the edges when held to the light. A medium sized head of mocha colored bubbles slowly settles to a collar, leaving some lacing.
S- The aroma is glorious, with toasted coconut from the rum barrel complimenting the base beer aromas of dark chocolate, vanilla, roasty coffee, and just a touch of chili peppers. A good bit of fudge really puts this over the top! There's a slightly acetone-like booziness that is the only thing keeping me from giving the aroma a perfect rating!
T- The flavor explodes on your tongue, a bit messy and overwhelming at first, but it comes together with time. There are big boozy notes up front of spiced rum. These are followed by bitter baker's chocolate, and a very assertive dark roast coffee. The coconut and vanilla are there, but take a back seat to other flavors. The finish is dry cocoa and chili pepper heat.
M- The mouth feel is medium with a lot of dryness, and good carbonation. A bit thin for an imperial stout, and drinks more like an imperial porter (think Victory At Sea), but still excellent.
O- Everything comes together here to make for a world class beer! As far as chili stouts go, this is one of the best! 1,223 charactersSadMachine, Dec 19, 2013

Pours dark coffee brown with some mocha head. 
Nose is very coffee-forward. Not picking up much barrel presence at this stage. 
Taste is very bright-coffee with some dark chocolate. I don't get much heat from the peppers but I do think they add to liven up the back end. 
Seen some reviews that felt the rum sorrels made the beer too sweet; I was struggling to tell that even spent time in a barrel. This isn't necessarily a terrible thing since the base beer is excellent, but it would be nice to have shown up a little more.
Would've thought is beer was around 10%, not a monster at 14. Half a bottle was a good way to end the night. 
Got one more bottle, hopefully the next one has a little more rum. 735 charactersCruisaC, Dec 15, 2013
4.57/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This stout actually holds a deep dark brown body to go with its equally brown colored frothy head.
The aromas hold intense toasted malt, roasted coffee, smoke, and a tobacco leaf like scent. Chocolate and molasses hold just barely underneath.
The flavors are roasty first, with a coffee and malt quality. The taste then gains complexity as it goes to the back of the mouth. Fresh cigar smoke and tobacco leaf tastes abound with more roasts such as coffee and malt. Then the molasses and sorghum flavors pop out. This then ends in a peppery capsaicin spiciness.
The feel is very thick and full with a smooth velvety texture.
This is simply fantastic. It holds so much quality that it confounds me that this will only be available once. 738 charactersKYGunner, Dec 15, 2013

Appearance: Pours black and leaves a couple fingers of deep tan head which fade very slowly.
Smell: Big coffee notes, mocha, dark chocolate, plums, figs, raisins, oak, rum, vanilla. Very rich and mouth-watering. The coffee sticks out the most though.
Taste: Coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, and finishes very nice with some rum and chillies. Really delicious. Alcohol is really well masked by all the wonderful flavors.
Mouth-feel: Low to medium carbonation with a full, thick, creamy body. Really nice, thick feel to it - matches the style very nicely.
Overall: This is a really nice, complex stout. Delicious coffee, chocolate, dark fruit flavors are complimented by the rum barrels to make a really complete beer. The rum barrels definitely helped to smooth this out and added some nice flavors. 856 charactersResuin, Dec 11, 2013

Smell is upfront rum with that chocolate, coffee and malty magic. The first four drinks were all different, first one huge with rum and chocolate, second rum with coffee, third vanilla, coffee and slight presence of peppers, fourth peppers, chocolate with wood barrel qualities. I guess almost every drink of this was quite different until I got down down to the last half of the bottle. Drinking this is a transformative experience with each layer of the beer changing dominance of flavor with each drink. From the time you take that first drink and get the huge rum barrel flavors to when the peppers start to activate your taste buds, this is a unique beer to enjoy. 721 charactersjordanimal, Dec 05, 2013

Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, peppers, a little booze, and big time earthy spicy coffee. Flavor is mostly coffee, a bit of a pepper bite on the way down, and a very nice lingering vanilla and some sweetness (rum?) on the palate. I maybe only get the rum sweetness in the aftertaste, and this otherwise doesn't have much barrel going on. But even that is reaching. Very high carbonation for a BA beer, with the earthy coffee and pepper spice cutting through the viscosity. As it warms it becomes thicker and more chocolatey. Where is the rum here? It seems like they must have used light rum, rather than dark rum, for the aging. If that is the case, I think they missed out on what could have been a much better outcome. Overall, a nice brew, but really not much (any?) different from the regular version other than some additional alcohol. 932 charactersBMMillsy, Dec 03, 2013

Pours a cola brown with minimal head and no light passage. The nose starts with some green pepper followed by the lovely trinity of coffee chocolate and vanilla. The rum works to elevate all of these notes and add a bit of creaminess and depth to eah of the ingredients. Taste starts with some initial smokiness, follow by a bit of peppery heat. The barrel adds a bit of sweetness and boozy heat on the end. Each flavor is well represented and well balanced much like the base beer. Mouth feel is a bit on the thinner side considering the abv. Overall I enjoyed regular Bomb! A little more, but this rum version is definitely tasty! 645 charactershomebrew311, Dec 01, 2013

Appearance - Inky black. Not much of a head. No bubbles. Slightly transparent at the edges. 
Smell - Lots of chocolate. Some cinnamon. Coffee is rich. A little bit of rum, but it isnt strong. Peppers on the back end.
Taste - Very chocolatey. Coffe blends into the chocolate. Peppers enhance the chocolate. Some oak in the back and some sweetness from the rum. A bit of spiciness in the finish.
Mouthfeel - Really doesn't taste like 14%. Medium heavy body. Prett chewy. Medium low carbonation. 
Overall - I get more rum in the finish. Otherwise, it tastes just like Bomb, which is a great thing. 636 charactersAlieniloquium, Nov 25, 2013

S: The rum barrel aging has certainly changed this beer. The aroma is much more sweet. Spiced rum definitely takes over, with notes of vanilla, caramel, booze, and (strangely only once agitated) wood. It seems to be a bit disjointed. 3
T: My first question is...where did the peppers go? All of the balance that Prairie Bomb! offered is gone because the heat is non-existent, except for the moment that you swallow the beer. The taste is very much focused on the rum, which allows for the sweetness to take over. Chocolate, roast, and slight vanilla mostly. 3.5
MF: The body is roughly as thick as Prairie Bomb!, but the increased amount of booze and negatively impacted balance makes for a minus in the drinkability category. 4
Value: At $15 for this 12oz bottle, I'd say it was too much for its worth. Pay less and get a better beer for Prairie Bomb!. 3
O: This was a pretty big disappointment. I really loved the base beer for this, and thought that it could only get better. The barrel aging muted the base, bringing it back to the pack. It amazes me that Pirate Bomb! has a better trading value than Prairie Bomb!, because anyone who has tried both should be able to attest to the fact that Prairie Bomb! blows it out of the water. I'm sad to think that there could be this much more Prairie Bomb! on the market, because I want to drink it all. 3 1,543 charactersrusswbeck, Nov 23, 2013

stubby 12oz bottle sealed with pressure cap and a nasty booger green colored wax.
Appearance: black bodied beer with 1 full finger of almost medium khaki head. 
Smell: Chocolate, spent coffee grinds, vanilla, earthy peppers. Subtle hint of rum and oak.
Taste: starts off sweet. Milk chocolate, a "marshmellowy" vanilla note, and a hint of rum without much booziness that all integrates together very nicely. The sweetness gets pushes aside by earthy and green pepper flavor complimented by some acrid spent coffee. Also starting to get some more barrel notes of tobacco, wet oak and even a little more rum. In the finish the chocolate turns a little bitter and you start to get that slightly bitter cocoa nib flavor, but becomes balanced by the sweetness of the rum. Just a touch of heat in the back of your throat after you swallow; a combo of the rum and peppers. Complex, redicousely balanced just like prairie bomb. The rum barrel never takes a front seat in this beer, I wanted a little more rum flavor to take this beer to EPIC status. I see what prairie wanted to do here and they are all about balancing flavors in the stouts. They are good at it too! 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low carbonation. creamy, silky. and smooth. The beer thins out a little bit when it get close to room temperature, but you still can't tell that the beer is 14%. it drinks like its well below the listed ABV. This beer is such a great sipper. I can sip on this beer for well over an hour. I really enjoy how the beer lingers on your palate well after you take a sip of the beer. 
Overall: The rum barrel notes are weaker than I was hoping for, but you can still find the rum flavors in the beer, especially when the beer is close to room temperature. The barrel aging definately improved the already fantastic mouthfeel of Prarie Bomb. Its another delicous stout by Prarie. If I had to choose I would take Pirate bomb over Prairie Bomb but its really really almost too close to call. 2,009 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Nov 12, 2013

Very dark creamy head again, little fizzy fluffy this time, little lacing, super pitch black and nice legs. 
Nose can be smelled from 20 feet away practically. Again so much fresh coffee, fresh roast and brewed mostly a smooth rich slightly nutty coffee but not dark or tannic or too roasty. More dark choc, cocoa nibs, and bakers, etc, but all the above is cut down a little compared to the original bomb. Rum is there, a decent rum, fresh molasses rum, but it doesn't necessarily play well with the other characters and seems to take away from them slightly. A little buttery rum character too. A mild Sumatra like heavy acidic roasted coffee.
Taste is good, but again the rum seems to cut through the awesomeness if it. But still a nice coffee to start, great smooth rich coffee, delicious coffee without much roasty character. Lots of vanilla too, nice fresh vanilla bean character, into a dark choc and bakers choc, cocoa nib too. Ancho chilli is mostly gone now, little pepper heat and almost no smoke, etc . Again the nice rum flavor that adds its own nice flavor, and the chili starts to come out a bit more. Finish is long, bit of some from the chili finally and chili heat, mild booze, nice dark choc and cocoa, lots of coffee and vanilla lingering, and a light high quality molasses rum flavor lingering. 
Mouth is full bod, rich, thick, and heavy, decent carb, very mild warming booze. 
Overall hard to decide, very good, the great characters of the original like coffee vanilla and cocoa are muted a bit due to the rum, but the rum adds it's own awesome character, nicely blended, so hard to compare. Both so delicious though. 1,823 charactersjlindros, Nov 11, 2013

The beer pours an inky black color that leave tan oily looking residue in the glass and is topped by a razor thin, tan head, which settles  quickly around the perimeter. The nose is sweet coffee, spices, and bread upfront, but is cut by slightly burnt caramel and ethanol. It has a coffee forward flavor profile with most of the barrel, chili, and alcohol sitting on the palate in aftertaste. This is a heavy bodied beer, but not syrupy, with adequate carbonation and bright coffee/chili acidity that penetrates the saturating stout base. It's velvety sweet, but neither cocoa nor vanilla seem to dominate (though cocoa lingers a bit longer) and has minimal ethanol. This is definitely a great beer - I'd recommend it to others and will continue to grab when it hits shelves. 791 charactersThePorterSorter, Nov 10, 2013

This stuff is like gold right now as it's a limited brew sold only in Oklahoma - thank you Prairie! After watching a dude take the last four bottles of Pirate Bomb at one store, I rushed across Stillwater, OK to Du Laney's Retail Liquor and nabbed 3 bottles of my own. AND...they were at a discount! Woot!
I poured Pirate Bomb into a Chimay chalice as I felt it was well-deserved being national stout day and all. The thing is black and thick like lawnmower oil at the end of a long hot summer. An aggressive pour renders a sticky single finger cap of mottled dark brown foam, some parts lighter and others very dense and dark.
This beer is one of those complex brews that batters your senses from every angle. The nose - espresso, dark baker's chocolate, rum, cherry cordials, and dark fruit and chili peppers simmering in alcohol. Some hints of vanilla cookie as well.
Flavor? This is Pirate BOMB! Definitely a flavor bomb! Allowing it to warm a bit it's all about the robust fresh grind coffee, dark chocolate, and rum. I get cherries, vanilla, and some bittering hops as well. The chilies are present but faint - flavor of ancho and no burn. There is a slight vinous presence as well as a chocolate mousse in the aftertaste. BIG.
Massive slick full body. The mild carbonation lends itself to the silky feel. Very sticky. Candy sticky. Big alcohol dryness as well. You can get pretty lit with just one.
I was down right lucky to score this elusive beer. I can't give it a 5 because the rum and coffee are a little over the top, but I do enjoy that combination. I have not had regular Bomb, but I would assume those who don't like rum would prefer it over Pirate. This is sure to be a highly traded beer. Good job Prairie! 1,848 charactersDelMontiac, Nov 09, 2013

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice oily black hue with a thick half finger mocha head that fades to leave awesome lacing and legs awesome.
S - Aromas of TONS of rum, which has kind of overpowers the ancho and coffee, chocolate is there, same with vanilla. Everything is subdued from the original thanks to the rum, it's still delicious aroma though.
T - Taste is just like bomb, but with the rum overpowering everything else a bit. Chocolate is very nice, along with vanilla, but the ancho is long gone. The rum is very nice and prominent, great barrel, rich and good quality rum here. Delicious, the vanilla and chocolate food artists with the rum.
M - Mouthfeel is super silky lightly carbonated, no way this drinks like 14%.
O - Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I think I like regular bomb a bit more but man oh man is this a great beer. Love it. 936 charactersrudzud, Nov 09, 2013

Looks just like regular Bomb. Pitch black, opaque body with a nice 1cm fluffy brown head with good retention. It finally drops into the beer after a while; leaving a placid looking stout.
Now this beer smells a lot like regular Bomb, except I can't get as much of the adjuncts. There is some coffee and some roastiness, but its mostly dominated by sweet rum. In my opinion, the rum really detracts from the rich nose of the regular Bomb.. in fact, I'd go as far as to say that it really is neutered by the rum.
Flavour profile is no different.. it's like regular Bomb except muted, covered up by the sweet rum. Not a lot of oak or vanilla either; it's mostly just sweet rum. I really feel that the rum aging didn't really help this beer a lot. Regular Bomb is fantastic and it was done a disservice with rum aging.
Creamy, full-bodied, even more so than regular Bomb. Heat is ever present, from the rum. 
Yep, the barrel-aging kind of didn't do right by this base beer. The base beer is drinking fantastic still, with a lot of complexity and great mouthfeel but barrel-aging it just gave it more rum character that overpowers everything else and adds some additional heat, which finally reminds me that it is a 14% beer. Regular Bomb doesn't have the heat, but this one reminds you there is 14% alcohol. I don't really like this version of Bomb and wouldn't recommend giving up the farm for it. 1,532 charactersStevedore, Nov 07, 2013

T: I actually like Bomb! more than Pirate Bomb. Bomb! is so perfect that rum barrel aging it takes away from the beer. I wonder if anyone else agrees. I get a bit of rum, and then a muted version of the non BA version. I would seek out Bomb! before Pirate Bomb; unless you are a BA junkie like me and you have to try it. 
M: Bomb! has perhaps the best mouthfeel of any stout that I have tried. So money on this one. 
O: Great beer, but not as good as non BA version. Weird to say that.
(edit, I changed the rating for the better after realizing that I love this beer) 703 charactersgueuzedreg, Nov 07, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Riding upon the heels of Prairie Bomb, what could possibly give the beer even more identity, more complexity and more intrigue? I might as well be asking myself, "When is rum never the answer?"
Jet black in its pour, the dark beer crawls into the glass with an inky trail of legs. The ale slowly separates its liquid from its froth as a mocha-stained meringue piles on top. Lacing lightly, the alcohol seems to fight its foam stance midway through the session. Its simply a massive stout that earns respect from its appearance alone.
Its incredibly roasty aroma fuses together the notes of fresh-brewed espresso, roasted walnuts and dark chocolate. Malty aromas of black-strap molasses blends into sweet rum notes with ease. Sweet to the nose, other complex and earthy notes emit with a firm pepper-like scent when the common hop grassiness is usually expected. Light campfire and burnt fruit rise as the beer warms for even more complexity and charm.
The taste erupts in the mouth with lavish roast, rich espresso, bittersweet chocolate, roasted nuts and burnt molasses. Its spicy-sweet middle is of maple and rum blended with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and dark fruit with capsacin. As the beer trails into a semi-sweet fudgy roundness, its roast remains high and its warm alcohol soothes the stomach as well as it does the taste buds.
Undoubtedly full bodied, the ale is both creamy with its expansive carbonation and also lightened by it. The bubbles seem to make the beer float just above the tongue with a semi-arid dryness and powdery roast character. By the time that the carbonation subsides, the sweetness has already faded and the spicy warmth of alcohol and capsacin linger boldly on the throat.
As the taste of bourbon highlights the original Bomb, it seems that the flavors of chili, fruit and spice is further woken by the rum barrel addition. I have a feeling there's a lot of pirates out there looking for this bounty! 1,940 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 04, 2013

4.27/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Popped this bad boy open during Sunday football. It tasted so much like regular Bomb! I had to open one next to it. Appearance is pretty similar just a little darker head. Not much head but what is there is mocha colored. Body you can see through but a nice very deep amber in color. Aroma is where I get the most whiskey and there is a lot of alcohol. Also some vanilla and darker chocolate notes. Taste is a lot of coffee still, not much whiskey, but a little alcohol burn. Chocolate. Body is a little light for a 14% Double Imp Stout, but at least it is not syrupy. 
Overall I enjoy it, but really not much different from regular Bomb! so why go through the effort? Still delicious, and would never turn one down. 717 charactersRuckusDu, Nov 03, 2013

Smells of chocolate and coffee, so it’s no wonder that those both dominate the initial taste. The alcohol and vanilla begin to appear, followed by a perfect amount of heat from the chilies. Nice mouth, but not as oily as I would have expected. This is an absolutely wonderful, memorable beer. 332 charactersMartzMimic, Nov 01, 2013

Pour is very dark brown with that middle dark Abercrombie kind of khaki colored head. Primarily opaque with mild translucency around the glass edge. 
First smell at roughly 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Wow. Like an adult Mounds candy bar with coffee added. Lots of coconut, cacao, dark chocolate, mild toffee, sweet rum, bold and acidic coffee. Decadent. 
Taste is beyond delicious. All the Aromatic notes blossom into a really well balanced flavor profile. Rum is first and last, but it never overwhelms. Raisin, bitter coffee, salted caramel, dark chocolate, Light barrel character, light chili pepper, and a great sweet vs bitter interplay comprise the taste. 
Palate is filling but slightly thin for what I’d expect. A bit of burn sets in, but it’s chili-based. As it warms it becomes nearly sublime.
If I had dreamed of this before tasting it, I wouldn’t and couldn’t have imagined it tasting much better. Well done Prairie! 1,033 charactersjsboots21, Oct 31, 2013

Pours like hydraulic fluid, some traces of carbonation can be seen despite the ebony color, one finger of caramel colored head. Insane lacing & head retention 
S: Carob, coconut, dark chocolate & vanilla
T: Vanilla, coconut, caramel, dryness & dark chocolate all open strong, a little bit of cayenne pepper burn. More vanilla, pepper heat, chocolate, caramel & coffee notes as this warms. Finishes with mocha, charred grain in small doses, more vanilla, pepper burn, cakeyness, caramel & dryness
MF: Thick, warming with soft carbonation, thins out a touch as this warms, very warming
ABV is masked nicely. Even better than Bomb in many ways, a hell of a compliment. Another World Beater from Prairie! Please make this as much a possible Healey Bros.... 912 charactersrusspowell, Oct 20, 2013

4.96/5  rDev +10.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured like thinned oil from bottle and had a brownish black head. Excellent coffee aroma and taste with rum layered in between. The coffee was perfect and I can see it fading with age like most do. The vanilla beans and cacao nibs are not overly aggressive and add a nice complexity to this beast. I loved how mellow the rum was and was hardly able to taste the chiles in this. The mouthfeel was nice and not too thick. Aftertaste kept me coming back for more. Overall this is a excellent example of barrel-aged imperial stout. 528 charactersNuggetz, Oct 19, 2013
