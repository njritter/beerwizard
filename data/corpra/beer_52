4.34/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Look - a slightly opaque golden orange with a one-finger white head that sticks around and has decent lacing throughout.
Smell - dank pungent hops are front and center, but you also get a nice array of hop aromas in the form of citrus (grapefruit, lemon, orange) and floral notes. There are also some sweet notes lingering in the background that might be caramel malts.
Taste - very similar to the nose in that dank resin, earthy hops are very powerful, but it's balanced with the lighter side of the hop spectrum since the citrus and floral notes (like mentioned above) shine through. Again, there's a slight malty presence in the form of caramel and bread, but these notes are almost completely overpowered by the thick hop characteristics. 
Feel - high carbonation, medium body, sticky mouthfeel.
Overall, this is definitely an interesting example of the style. It tastes more like an imperial IPA, but it still maintains aspects of a lighter, refreshing pale ale. It's a hop bomb for sure, which isn't exactly my thing anymore, but I would absolutely jump at the chance to have this again. 1,093 charactersMMOSNN, Jun 15, 2017

Slightly cloudy orange with a finger of white head. A nice departure from the NEIPAs I've been drinking lately.
Nose is pure Citra. Orange rind, grapefruit, and pine.
The taste follows. Floral, hoppy, citric. Easy-drinking. Medium bitterness.
Mouthfeel is medium. 
Overall, very good and deservingly a legend, but maybe not as mind-blowing as I expected. 9/10 394 charactersmkh012, Jun 07, 2017

Hazy dirty orange caramel with a constant cascade of bubbles making their way to the well laced, cream colored sheet on top.  Nose is potent a few feet away,  as the grapefruit dandelion duo overpowers.  Any questions on depth are immediately washed away upon first swig, as the grapefruit and floral attack has caramel malt backup before this shockingly light drinker all but vanishes, leaving a memorable bitterness. 476 charactersgopens44, Jun 06, 2017
4.3/5  rDev -5.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a muddy orange color with a finger's worth of white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. Speckled lace, semi-sticky.
The aroma possessed a fine blend of citrusy and piney hops - bold, zesty, spicy and bitter claiming a nice smooth caramel malt base following into a light earthiness.
The flavor was fully bittersweet between the citrus, pine, and zesty sort of spicy hop boldness. Malt base tasted nice against the hops. Aftertaste was light and kept to the hops more than expected for an APA.
The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a great sessionability about it. Hop harshness isn't distracting - bitterness is there but not controlling.
Overall, well done APA, spectacular for a session, a bit hoppier for the style but an honest to goodness all around great beer! 844 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 04, 2017

Same character from the nose: lemon and grapefruit citrus and soap.  A quick flash of honey-caramel malt sweetness.  Soft pithy bitterness in the aftertaste.
Soft mouthfeel with just the right level of carbonation.
The different pieces in the beer all come together exceptionally well.  The kiss of malt in the taste and the great mouthfeel are just about perfect.  Lives up the hype, IMO. 553 charactersthebeers, Apr 19, 2017

The nose isn't strong. It's hoppy and sweet.
Head recedes quickly but leaves a thin layer that didn't go away giving way to a fair amount of lacing.
The perfect amount of bitterness. No bite. There are sweet citrus notes hidden in the hops.
The mouth feel it's wonderful. Perfect carbonation for the flavor. Smooth with tiny prickles.
I understand the cult following and am now slave to the trend.

4.48/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Thrilled to get my hands on such a highly rated beer. Bottle looks cool and hoping what's inside lives up to the hype. Bottled 3/17/17 so pouring this one fresh. Pours a "typical" APA color- medium amber and just a bit hazy. Decent one-finger head but lots of carbonation based on the bubbles streaming from the bottom of my glass. Leaves fantastic lacing as beer is consumed. 
Smells hoppy of course, but not overly so. Somewhat light and floral. Obvious citrus tones-- grapefruit for sure-- and sweetness. Malts on the nose as well.
Taste is bitter from Citra hops with hints of citrus. Malts and bread blended well with the hops. Very smooth and well balanced taste overall for this style. 
Feel is light, carbonated, and dry.
Overall, I can't complain. A great beer, not world-class IMHO. Thankfully this is not the best pale ale I've ever had as it is hard to come by where I'm from. However, I would absolutely pick this up again if given the chance. The overall balance is this beer's strong point. 1,009 charactersBdubz94, Apr 08, 2017

L: Pours a bright apricot, quite cloudy with particulate, with a dense half-inch cream-colored head that has some nice retention and leaves considerable lacing on the glass. Through the fine particulate, a healthy visible carbonation is present.
S: A fruity aroma is present as I open the bottle, even before pouring. Big ripe stone fruit, orange, grapefruit, melon, and pineapple are all represented in the bouquet--these notes play on top of cracker malts. Just a bit of funky hop notes--slightly grassy and herbal--complete the experience.
T: The taste is considerably more bitter at the front than what I was bracing for. The fruit notes are there, but they lack some of that fresh, ripe quality they had in the nose--I'm getting quite a bit of grapefruit and citrus rind at the front, mingling with some pine and grassy hop flavor above a cracker malt base. As the flavor moves to the middle, there's more of that funky/herbal hop flavor coming through, along with some deeper stone fruit flavors. There's just a hint of warming alcohol as the flavor transitions to the back end. The back brings more of the citrus rind/grapefruit and stone fruit character--certainly on the more bitter end of the spectrum--and the close brings assertive citrus rind and pine bitterness, with just a bit of tropical and stone fruit lingering above it all.
F: On the lighter side of medium-bodied, this one never feels watery on the palate. Very nice level of carbonation, affording this one a bright, smooth, bitter, and dry feel in turns. While the finish brings the bitter, the dry close allows a lot of flavors to continue playing on the palate in the aftertaste.
O: I don't know that this beer ever could have lived up to my expectations and the hype surrounding it, but I will say that it's a very good beer well worth finding. It could be the date of the bottle, but I was hoping that more of the ripe, juicy fruit notes from the nose would be present in the taste. I will say that very few pale ales I've tried have anything close to the flavor depth of this one, and everything--from the look to the smell to the feel--is really on point. 2,332 charactersDabblinWiscCraft, Mar 28, 2017
4.07/5  rDev -10.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This was a disappointment for me.
Been waiting  a while to give it a try and finally scored one thanks to my buddy Jake in MN.
As I said to him - in my opinion, beers like this had their time, and I appreciate that I was able to give it a try but it was like Pliny for me -  good, fun to check it off the list, but it falls way short compared to the east coast stuff I drink all the time.  Trillium, Tree House etc etc....
Check it off the list if you get the chance.   I wont be on the hunt for any more. 505 charactersryno6616, Mar 27, 2017

4.71/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 12 oz can into a nonic pint glass. Bottling date is 3/7/17, 18 days ago.
Zombie Dust pours a hazy golden orange color, with a nice two finger off-white head that has good retention throughout. The beer leaves a nice amount of lacing on the glass and is a very nice looking beer overall.
The aroma of the beer is a pleasant combination of hops, with notes of citrus - primarily grapefruit and citrus rind - as well as piney and resinous scents. 
The taste of this one is hop forward, but the various flavors are balanced well. Strong piney flavors are mellowed by citrus before a slightly bitter finish.
The mouth feel is crisp, with a medium body and carbonation on the low end of medium. 
Overall, this liberally hopped APA is near perfect and well deserving of its reputation. 797 charactersMaestro0708, Mar 26, 2017

Nose is of fresh, bold citrus. Taste of bright citrus fruits. Grapefruit and orange peel. A small bit of floral in there too but the citrus is the star. Getting a bit of sweet sticky caramel malts coming through too that I enjoy. It is very juicy, not as bitter or pungent as I thought it might be and because of that, it is a a very smooth and easy drinking beer. Medium body with a light creaminess to its body. Semi crisp and dry finish. I love Zombie Dust! This beer is as advertised IMO. Cheers 608 charactersMFMB, Mar 11, 2017

Appearance- A deep golden color with about a finger of thick darker head. Lots of bubbling carbonation. Lacing down the entire glass. 
Smell- Lots of tropical type fruits and just enough hops. Definitely stays true to the style. 
Taste- More grapefruit and orange than the smell led me to believe. The dry hops come through as almost an aftertaste. The hoppy bitterness blends with the fruit notes for a fantastic brew. 
Mouthfeel- Crisp with super clean carbonation. The dry finish seems to make the flavor last forever. 
Overall- A phenomenal low ABV beer. You just keep drinking it and wanting more. The hoppy taste and carbonation mix for a very drinkable beer. Highly recommend getting some if you can find it. 775 charactersKdouble, Mar 10, 2017

This is what I consider the ideal type of IPA.  It is floral, "juicy" and not just a super-bitter hop bomb.  It's not bitter.
I'm not into artsy descriptions of aroma, etc, so my closest comparison to other beers is that this is a little brother of Heady Topper (which is a DIPA). 457 charactersPJKSR02, Feb 20, 2017

Bottle date: BOTTLED ON 1-18-17 949
Mildly hazy, honey-hued body; dense, spongy, creamy head. Fruity aroma, pine sap aroma; mild biscuit aroma. Bready, bitter flavor abounds; juicy, pitted fruit taste; peach and apricot. Heavy body; gentle rasp on the palate; powdery, dry mouthfeel with sublime, low-key fruit sweetness throughout.
A well-balanced, nicely complex beer bringing a nice blend of sweetness and bitterness together into one fine tasting beverage. I'm somewhat surprised at the lack of strong hop aroma in this one (my expectation), and the appearance, although very fine, didn't strike me as exceptional. Yet the taste and mouthfeel are some of the best I've encountered for this style of beer. One can't go wrong with Zombie Dust. Yes, indeedy... 926 charactersbeergoot, Feb 12, 2017

A- Pours peachy gold, 1/2 inch head. Carbonation bubbling up nicely.   As I drink it, nice lacing on the glass which lasted until the end. 
S- Orange, tropical fruit , light hops. Backed by very mild earth and malt.  More delicate than the bombs being made these days. 
T: Orange and grapefruit, first a little sweet with the orange and something else tropical (can't put my finger on it, but it is there), then a light bitterness of orange zest and grapefruit, some pine, hints of malt, followed by dry hoppy finish.  As it has warmed I am getting some pineapple, too. It is so balanced, this is no bomb, nothing slaps you, just very well-crafted. 
M: Medium-light body, quite crisp, good carbonation, clean and dry finish with just a hint of oil.
O: The sum is even better than its parts. It's what a pale ale should be, before brewers started trying to one-up each other with a dump truck full of hops. Unlike those brews, you can drink a sixer of this and not overwhelm your taste buds to the point of exhaustion. Very refreshing.  The ABV does not say "session" but I could drink this all day. World-class, makes me proud to be a Hoosier.  I am looking forward to getting this fresh this summer on my trip to FFF. 1,325 charactersdrgonzo767, Feb 11, 2017

A: Pours a somewhat hazy golden-orange in color with a 1/2 inch, foamy, cream colored head with short retention. Thin, white lacing throughout.
S: Big aromas of citrus and tropical fruits consisting of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, melons, mango, and passion fruit. Milder hints of earthy and piney hops.
T: Starts off with big notes of grapefruit and orange rind followed by milder notes of pineapple, melons, guava, and hints of caramel malts. Tropical fruit elements become more present as the beer warms. Finishes with a nice lingering piney, resinous hop bitterness.
F: Medium bodied, smooth, and crisp with moderate carbonation. Somewhat dry finish.
O: Overall, this is a great APA. Very well balanced and drinkable. Showcases the Citra hops well, though it's not as fruity as a lot of other highly rated Citra APA's. Would really like to try a fresh bottle or fresh from the source to see how it compares. 979 charactersBeerGuy8315, Feb 09, 2017

Smell: Orange is the big scent I get, as well as a general citrus aroma.
Taste: The citrus comes in with a big pop, largely the sweeter citrus i.e. oranges or clementines, and a bitterness of grapefruit.
Feel: medium bodied and easy to drink. There's a slight drying bitterness in the finish, but nothing unbearable. 
Overall: A nice pale ale that was a precursor to the tropical fruit bombs. If this were available locally, I'd definitely pick up sixers from time to time. 577 charactersCfred371, Jan 31, 2017

Slow waves of pine, resin and citrus to the nose.  Tastes of citrus juice first and foremost, followed by faint notes of pine, a sclice of orange peel, some fine and spent grain, and a touch of caramel and a hint of spice.  All is well-blended to near perfection and goes down crisp and easy. 377 charactersstephens101, Jan 21, 2017

Smell is mostly citrus with maybe some pine in the background. 
Taste is big citrus followed by a nice and smooth bitterness.
Feel is smooth and carbonation is moderately.
Overall fresher is better with zombie dust. It has a tendency to fall off quickly.  But a fresh bottle is a thing of beauty.  For a pale ale (or ipa) this thing packs a punch of flavor. 406 charactersFFFjunkie, Jan 10, 2017

It's hard for them to get this ,but I have been able to obtain it on a regular basis since the 3 Floyd's  brewery is roughly a half hour away from where I live. They don't live in the area.  My point is I think it is a great  APA.  But, to me the taste is overpowering......a little too hoppy/bitter.  I do confess my preference is malty over hoppy though.      
 ****   Add on:   I am changing my tune on this one.....becoming more of a  hop- head since I wrote the part before the "add on".  Just picked up a 6-pack that wasn't even a week old ..... world class is right!  
***** Add on 2:  Drinking one now and this is better than world class! 782 charactersHackattack, Jan 03, 2017

This brewery has made me realize some heaven on earth kind of thing with beer  over the years.  First, it was with alpha.  To be conditioned on mass produced stuff and tasting alpha in the 90's made me realize that it made you really question what else have they been feeding me, kind of thing.   
Today, I went down to the across the lines liquor store, like you cross one state to get to where they sell this and spent nearly 20 bucks in poor dunk Indiana to get this marvelous 6 pack of beer.
The best pale ale creation ever. 707 charactersSWOhio-aquifer, Dec 11, 2016

A very smooth pour gives just a little more than a finger of head into my can-style glass.  The head is maybe just a hair off white.  Pillowy, a tiny bit soapy looking, but nothing bad.  The body is on the darker side as far as pale ale’s go.  It’s a deep orange, with some brown hues, slightly cloudy.  Head retention is decent, after a few minutes, a little bit remains.  Carbonation looks high.  Overall it looks good so far.
The nose is lightly bitter with a soft, un offensive sweetness.  Reminds me of vanilla or honey sweetness, maybe some caramel.  Now that I’ve focused in on the malt profile, I can hardly notice the hops.  Not quite an English pale ale, but definitely not a west coast pale ale.  It’s not bad, just not what I’m used to.  Very clean, but somewhat simple smelling. Maaaaybe some light fruit in here, but overall a very one dimensional hop presence.  Overall it’s good.
Flavor is much the same, definitely getting a fair amount of honey out of this beer.  Light bitterness hits at the beginning, and is drown out by the fairly large sweetness.  Minimal to no lingering bitterness.  I mean, there is just a lot of honey here.  I’m not really sure how to grade this for taste.  It tastes good, but it surely is not what I am used to, or what I would look for in a pale ale.  I’ll let it warm a little bit, but for now, it’s good, not great.
The body is just about perfect for a pale, thick enough to hold it together, and light enough to be sessionable.  The carbonation is a little confusing, it seems low, then high, never too low though.  Regardless, it’s a good mouthfeel. Bitterness is not invasive.
The drinkability is very high.  Low bitterness and a light body, in relation to the sweetness.
The flavor remained pretty much the same over the course of warming up.  Overall this is a fine beer, just nothing stellar, in my opinion.  I wouldn’t mind drinking it again.
The head that remained after the initial run off, hung around for quite some time.  I got fantastic, thick lacing all the way down the glass.  This was a really nice looking beer. 2,141 charactersMaltsOfGlory, Dec 09, 2016

Look: Semi clear golden with a two-inch white head.
Aroma: The aroma is hoppy with citrus, tropical fruit and pine.
Taste: lots of tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, as well as pine resin, and it was dank.
Feel: Medium body, medium carbonation, juicy, just delicious. 444 charactersThomas_Wikman, Nov 23, 2016

4.55/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Outdoor7or24 for the gift of this exceptional brew! Pours a medium amber producing 3 full fingers of frothy, beige, variously bubbled, frothy head that leaves rings & webs of soapy lacing. Aroma citrusy lemon-orange & piney hops backed by sweet & thick caramel malt. Taste is a huge citrus juice/peel & pine bitter hoppiness! Which subdues & overruns the sweet caramel malt of the nose. There's a toasty buttered breadiness & tropical fruitness in the background. Huge hop bite & bitterness from start through aftertaste that intensifies from mid-sip into initial aftertaste. More like an IPA than a PA. There is something in both the nose & the mouth that is onion like, not off putting at all, but different. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, juciy throughout, peppery & creamy in the finish. It is difficult for me to believe that this is a 60 IBU brew, the bitterness seems higher than that. But what the hey, I'm a hophead at heart. 950 charactersmothmanscott, Nov 13, 2016

Appearance: Color is a bright amber orange. Moderate amount of bubbles and a solid finger of off white head that settles into a thin patchy layer. 
Smell: A very juicy hop driven aroma with a scent of citrus fruit and pine. Upfront citrus fruit scent of orange peel, grapefruit, mango, tangerine, and lemon with a hint of peach. Earthy hop scent of ripe pine resin and grass. Malt hints of caramel, grains, and cracker with some yeast. A really good juicy aroma. 
Taste: Like the aroma, a really ripe and juicy hop forward taste with big notes of citrus fruit and pine. Big juicy citrus hop notes of grapefruit, orange peel, mango, tangerine, and lemon zest along with some peach and pineapple. Earthy hop notes of pine resin along with some grass. Background malt notes of caramel, cracker, and grains along with yeast. A great juicy taste. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Very juicy and oily with a drying finish. 
Overall:  A really great hoppy Pale Ale. Has the citrus hop flavor of the best West Coast IPA's. Glad to finally get to try this. 1,158 charactersMattyG85, Oct 20, 2016

I had been wanting to try this one for a long time, but I had never been able to make it to the brewery or find it in stores.  This beer features a white head that is frothy in appearance and dissipates slowly to a thin lacing that is retained.  The beer itself is clear and is an orangish amber color that has a nice glow to it.  Light carbonation is easily visible.  4.5/5  The aroma is definitely hop forward but there is a nice sweetness that balances it out.  Notes of cracker, biscuit, buttered white bread, and just a hint of light caramel showcase the malt while the hops really come out with pine resin and citrus peel.  4.25/5  The flavor features a brief intro of a very light caramel note as well as bit of buttered white bread before the hops quickly come in and take over.  Pine resin and orange peel really stand out as well as just a bit of grapefruit.  Surprisingly it is not overly bitter, but the bitterness is definitely present, as it should be.  The bitterness lingers lightly for quite a while.  4.5/5  Light to medium body in statures with a light carbonation burn up front that fairly quickly goes away, leaving a moderate dryness that lingers light after swallowing.  Very crisp and refreshing.  4.25/5  This is an excellent APA that really lives up to the hype.  Not crazy bitter like I expected, but it is definitely hop forward.  The sweetness helps tone things down just a bit without taking away from the hops.  By far my favorite APA as of this review.  4.5/5 1,616 charactersbwood06, Sep 30, 2016

The appearance is a really pretty amber gold with slight haze. Poured with a substantial white head with good lacing.  Lively carbonation bubbles up the glass. 
The aroma is a big and juicy citrus bomb along with tropical fruit, and some earthy dankness. 
The taste is big with bitter grapefruit, orange, dank earthy zest and a resiny hop note. 
The palate is light for a 6% hoppy pale with a lingering resiny hop bitterness along with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Overall this is a great juicy pale ale featuring Citra, which is my favorite hop. 705 charactersBartleby91, Sep 28, 2016

A-Pours a golden orange, with a one finger cream head, that sticks around for the duration. Spotty lacing. 
S-Smells of monster grapefruit and some piney earthy notes. Maybe some orange and sweet malt. Very inviting and pleasant. 
T-Extremely balanced. Taste of grapefruit, rustic pine, with a dab of earth, orange and malt. Juicy and delicious. You can definetly kill a 6 pack of these and not get tired. 
M-mild carbonation, with a perfect balanced, slightly bitter finish. Taste of grapefruit and pine. 
O-extremely good beer, very drinkable and solid. Not sure if it deserves 100,  but i Would definetly have it Again. Would prefer a Pliny any day over this one though. 756 charactersDrinkThemAll, Sep 07, 2016

The hops are very forward but we'll balanced out by a nice crisp malty body. The after taste comes slowly, but is very floral with notes of pine and fruit.

4.14/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Bottled on 5/11/16 and served in a sonic.  Pours lovely burnt orange hue with a translucent claret and a dense, 1.5 inch, cream-colored head.  Delicate citrus notes, a hint of something floral and a light biscuit malt presence.  Taste follows nose; however, a bit more malt forward than anticipated, albeit not overly so for the style with a earthy/herbal bitterness that reveals itself at the finish.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation.  Overall, a delicious APA albeit perhaps  not as bright as I remember it being.  Very quaffable nonetheless. 573 charactersJwale73, Aug 25, 2016
4.51/5  rDev -0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Exceptional, dense, creamy head with a super fine texture and the consistency of meringue. Head retention is likewise outstanding. Seafoam crowned my beer through to the last sip.
Aromas are straight cuts hops. Citrusy, zesty, a bit spicey. Some tropical fruits in there too. 
Flavors are citrusy, juicy, and smooth. Not super complex, but very balanced and with pristine focus. Biting bitterness, but not too much. Just enough malt to round things out while maintaining a dry, bittering, quenching finish. Nice.
Mouth feel is highly drinkable, quaffable even. Rare for such a happy brew. This one is like hop juice with some grain to give it body. 651 characterslogicalparadox, Aug 25, 2016

3.65/5  rDev -19.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5With the same mythic lore and scant availability as CA's Russian River beers, I knew this was a brew I had to track down. Sadly after several weeks of waiting and checking with my local liquor store I was left underwhelmed. The beer's piny, citrusy, and crisp intro led to a malty, sour finish.  On the plus side, the wide variety of taste profiles created by this beer gave it an interesting and distinguishable character.  Bottom line is that I had such high hopes for this beer and 3 Floyds was so close to a home run.  It also seems they have taken a page out of the California craft brewer's handbook for the price.  At $15 a 6 pack they are getting into hallowed ground that should only reserved for well known legends like Ballast Point and Stone.  The west coast beer renaissance is slowing diffusing to the midwest and enlightenment is near with product like this.  However, they aren't there yet. 906 charactersCABeerSnob, Aug 17, 2016

4.62/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Slightly hazy deep gold (6) pour; thick white head with good cap retention; very good clarity under the the cap; moderately heavy clingy lace. Spicy fruit, and lemony hop nose with a touch of pine. Lemon zest flavor with caramel malt hiding under bright fruit flavors; slightly bitter. Well carbonated, medium lite mouthfeel with just a scosh of resin. Overall, fresh, crisp, lite and bright. I thought I got a little earthy hop/mango along with the citrus; nevertheless, an very well balanced beer with a lite bitter citrus linger. 532 charactersDoctorZombies, Jul 20, 2016

The smell of  Zombie Dust is rich with hops bitterness grains and malts. The look and smell of this brew is really inviting, noting bad so far.   Now for the taste it is bold with flavors.  You pick up a nice amount of hop bitterness in the taste of this brew. There is also some nice notes of grains and malts in the taste of this brew.  This one of the better American Pale Ale's I have had. It is really bold with flavors.   I can't get over how smooth this brew is. Zombie Dust has a nice nice balance to it, there is overpowering about this brew.  The mouthfeel of Zombie Dust  is Bold, Rich, Clean, Smooth and refreshing. It is real hard to pick up on the 6.20% ABV in this brew , it is just that smooth.  Overall I'm giving Zombie Dust Brewed 3 Floyds Brewing Co., a 4.50 out of 5.  I would buy this brew again.  3 Floyds Brewing Co., did a real nice job with this one. 1,031 charactersnicholas2121, Jun 25, 2016

3.69/5  rDev -18.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Was gifted a Zombie Dust by a co-worker.  Not usually my type of beer, but I respect a well-made APA or IPA so it deserves a chance.
L -- Poured half-way into my imperial pint: lightly hazy deep gold, with a dense and sudsy white head that holds strong.
S -- Resiny Pine.  Done.  Okay, maybe some light citrus esters behind all the pine.
T -- Citrus flavors -- peach to grapefruit up front, with a well-balanced resiny pine character back.  Ever so light biscuit malts perceived in the back taste and aftertaste, resiny finish into the aftertaste.
M -- Soft and smooth mouthfeel with a dry, bitter finish and hot alcohol notes.
O -- I'd rate this higher if it was listed as an AIPA, but it's just too hop-heavy for me to think about slugging a few down like I would with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  It just *might* scare the undead. 834 characterssteveh, Jun 20, 2016

Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated the day this review is being written. I had hoped to score a case that hadn't been bottled yet but you know how it is.
Pours a lightly hazy orange golden color with a 2-finger off-white head. When the head dissipates it leaves a nice fluffy crown around the beer. Not much lacing to speak of.
The aroma has a ton of orange and some mild grapefruit. Par for the course for Citra hopped ales. Not a knock, that's just how it is. 
The taste, like the nose, is all citrus. Orange and grapefruit, maybe some tangerine. Finishes lightly bitter and piney.
The feel is medium bodied with moderately high carbonation. Just a slight lingering bitterness.
Overall, a great pale ale that doesn't quite meet the hype but honestly, who cares? It's a great beer with a great flavor. If citra is your thing then so will this beer be. 964 charactersScaryEd, Jun 05, 2016

Pours a slightly cloudy yellowish orange with a one-finger head.  Aromas of citrus and grapefruit rind/pith.  OK, this beer has been so hyped to me, it will be hard for it to live up to expectations but here goes.  Damn, that is tasty!  Lots of tropical flavors with citrus dominating.  Not a ton of caramel malt taste which is a definite plus for me.  Not overly bitter, and also contributing to the nice mouthfeel, not over-carbonated.  And this is only an APA.  I have had many IPAs that can't match the fresh hop flavor.  Believe what you've heard...this is a GREAT Pale Ale! 684 charactersPhilsPils, Jun 02, 2016

This is a great beer to enjoy on a nice warm Indiana summer day.  Many will tell you the hype is not justified.  Those individuals are the reason beer geeks get a bad rap.  Just because everyone says something is good, does not mean it's overrated.  If you have never enjoyed a ZD, try to find one.  While it won't likely be your best beer of all time, it will still be a really good choice. 477 characterspezhead_79, May 26, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.517 days old poured from a 12 oz bottle.  Pours golden amber color with minimal white head which quickly disappeared leaving minimal lacing.  The smell is strong citrus (mostly orange) and hops, as would be expected from a citra-hopped APA.  This borders the edge of an IPA, but it's done brilliantly. The mouthfeel is strong carbonation but smooth.  The taste is all citrus, orange,and hops with almost no lasting bitterness but a good malt balance on the back end.  This is an outstanding beer that would be a daily drinker for me if I had access to it. 554 charactersjvgoor3786, May 23, 2016
4.27/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25I'm not a big fan of pale ale's but, I saw this recently on tap at a growler bar and thought I would see what all the hype was about.
L- Poured into a 16 oz. Pint glass, looks like a typical pale ale. Hazy, light orange, with a foamy head and good lacing.
S- All of these pale ales smell similar to me, this one is no different. Hoppy, citrus, and grapefruit smell.
T- Taste follows the nose, hoppy with a very good balance. Not overly bitter, but it's there. 
F- Pretty heavy, took me a while to finish.
O- Well, this was about what I expected for the style. I don't prefer this type, but I can see why it is popular. Thought this was an excellent pale ale, one of the better ones I've had. If you haven't had a chance to try it, check it out, it's worthy of the hype! Highly recommended! 790 charactersdcjones82, May 23, 2016

If you go in expecting a life changing experience, you can only be disappointed - it's just a beer. But if you go in looking for a beer, it turns out it is really good! A big, juicy citrus and tropical fruit flavor, backed by a slight malty backbone. Mildly bitter. It's not complex, but it is very tasty and doesn't get tiring as you drink it. 430 charactersjrenihan, May 18, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, golden-copper coloring with a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body, and a foamy, bubbly, low profile, off-white head. Aromas of tart and sweet grapefruit, lemon zest, and orange rind blending with dried grass and piney resinous notes. Flavors are very tartly sweet forward, heavy on citrus, but with some tropical notes here and there, as well. Pineapple and mango highlight the heavy notes of grapefruit and orange rind. All of this atop a bitter green backbone of pine resin, dried grass, and moss. Perfectly balanced, on effervesced, crisp, and dry body. The aftertaste is a solid, balanced blend of the bitter green notes and the citrus medley. Amazingly balanced from beginning to end. The finish is smooth, slightly dry, and effervesced from the carbonation that stays steady flowing the whole time you drink. Amazing beer! 909 charactersGarthDanielson, May 06, 2016

nose is pretty faint... earthy dankness, grassy, bit of pineapple and light citrus zest. nice on the nose but definitely not jumping out at you. taste is definitely better, good orange, grapefruit, lemon/lime peel. definite sweetness, in part from a nice caramel malt, creates a candied citrus like taste. really nice. very subtle piney bitterness on the finish. mouthfeel is good, light carbonation, slightly creamy.

4.45/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5BOD 3/30/16.  Clear light amber (dark gold) pour.  World class head volume, lacing and retention.
World class nose of citra hops - orange, pineapple, mango - over a pale malt base with a touch of biscuit and caramel.
Light medium body that is smooth in texture with a oily slickness.  Very good carbonation / body balance with a mildly effervescent middle and a prickly finish.
The flavor profile is quite outstanding when rather cold, but becomes world class nearer room temperature.  Being single hop, it is not complex but it is reasonable in intensity and very well balanced.  It begins with a blended flavor that separates, to a degree, from the middle on.  First is a general citrus flavor that hints at zest then flows to a mildly bittered middle.  Bitterness is balanced by a subtle sweetness underneath that never really takes center stage when very cold, but shines near room temperature.  From here the tropicals arrive...mango, pineapple and finally orange.  Throughout the taste experience is a subtle earthy dank current that makes its strongest showing just before and through the finish.  The finish lingers with a light dryness and zest. 1,157 characterstillmac62, Apr 29, 2016

But never a true believer in the sanctity of piling-in-the-hops, I suggest that the mania around Zombie Dust should recede into history.
This beer smacks the buds with hops to the point that I cannot taste subtleties in the malts.
I do not need to drink this beer ever again. And why make the effort?  It is too hard to find !
An American classic... or is it time to fade from fashion. I choose the latter. for Zombie Dust.
3 months later, I broke my vow above and had it again at 3 Floyds brewpub along with the cheese plate. It went well with a sharp cheese, so I bumped up the OA rating by .25. Had again four weeks later, also on tap. No rating change. 737 charactersBeginner2, Apr 24, 2016

Taste: upfront sweet citrus fruit orange tangerine middle of the mouth you get a nice bready malt that really helps compliment the hops. Grapefruit pith orange peel in the finish you get zested lemon fresh cut grass and a big hoppy piney resin bitterness.
Feel: light Medium body pretty dry in the finish. Hop biterness lingers in the aftertaste.
Overall: this is the standard for a west coast american pale ale. A Big hop presence that's complimented with a touch of malt. sweet citrus fruits help add depth to the beer. An absolute treat! 627 charactersMasonz223, Apr 22, 2016

4.21/5  rDev -7.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured fresh into snifter, no longer than 3 weeks old. Received in a trade as an extra. Great extra at that! Been always wanting to see what the hypes about.
Pour is a copper, dark orange semi opaque. Tight white bubbles, half finger head. Decent lacing and stickiness to it.
Smell is initially citra bitterness. Getting lemon zest and orange peel. Definitely some sweet oranges and grapes as well. Very slight hop resin in the nose, not much malt either.
Citra hop foward with the taste. Some say you wouldn't know it's a APA by just trying it, but I disagree. Definitely tastes like an APA. Straight foward citra taste, nice sweet malty backbone. Very subtle pine. Not much tropical fruit going on at all. 
Mouthfeel is medium carbonation and medium bodied. Very crisp and clean.
Overall straight foward APA. Very one dimensional (citrus dominates, slight pine and sweet malt) but one dimensional isn't always a bad thing. Smooth, easy drinking. Very enjoyable. 968 charactersMateo2699, Apr 10, 2016

It's a solid pale ale that was likely a standout five years ago, but a lot has changed in five years. This was added two weeks before I joined this site and it was a whale back the.
It's a juicy easy drinker with a nice light bitterness. Can't go wrong with this, but there are many other breweries that were likely inspired by this and have since taken the style to the next level. 446 charactersmctizzz, Apr 01, 2016

S: Vibrant, juicy, dominated by citrus, pineapple and mango. Slight muted (in a good way) by pine, malt and hops.
T: Initial gentle bitterness with hops and malt upfront. Finishes more with pine and hops with a long last bitterness. The citrus and mango pops in and out subtly  throughout the whole experience.
F: Smooth, medium body that really helps the flavors develop and improving complexity. Carbonation is present, but not overpowering. 
O: Very good, but there wasn't anything for me that made it jump out compared to its reputation. I prefer IPAs so that may explain my opinion. Regardless, this was a great and unexpected extra. 787 charactersAdamAlway, Apr 01, 2016
4.99/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a tulip glass. 
Looks like a slightly hazy yellow pale ale with a decent head and nice lacing.
Smells like a citrus forward beer with hints of hops/pine.  
Tastes amazing.  Enough punch that you can't tell it's an APA, rivals great IPAs.  Citrus forward piney pale, with enough malts to feel like you are drinking something bigger than it is.  Incredibly balanced.
Feels like a crisp beer with a nice finish.  You can taste the fruit and hops long after.
Overall this is still my favorite beer and I consider myself an IPA drinker.  That's how great this beer is.  I wish everyone could get this, or at least me, because the beer is amazing, the name is dope, and the artwork is sick.  Love zombie dust. 720 charactersJay_P22, Mar 31, 2016

Served in : Tulip/chalice
Pours a beautiful mango-apricot glow, with just enough light penetrating the mostly opaque body to light up the sides in a glorious display. The head starts out thick and solid at 2 fingers, and recedes to about 1/2 finger (or a pinky) within a couple minutes' time. Lace is sparse, not as thick as I'd like APA's or IPA's to be, but still not a bad display.
Aromas of succulent fruits such grapefruit, mandarin orange, pineapple, mango, vinous grape, as well as white raisin and a touch of garlic. Minimal off notes in the nose. 
Flavor is thick, juicy, robust, and the bitterness is kept in check and reserved for the very last taste at the back. Flavors include bread crust, white grapefruit, orange pith and juicy flesh, banana bread, and onion skin towards the finish. 
Feel coats the palate but not too thickly. It stays for a small visit and then clears off the tongue to invite another sip or three. Carbonation is spot on, there's a nice creaminess to it. 
Overall, this is indeed a world class Pale Ale. I highly recommend Zombie Dust if you are not too sensitive to bitter beers and especially if you are fond of pales. 1,175 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Mar 31, 2016

Smell is a lovely burst of grapefruit, mango, orange, orange zest, with a grassy undertone. Lots of citra aromas. 
Taste has notes of grapefruit, mango and orange up front giving way to a balanced bitterness. Notes of grass and pine on the finish.
Medium carbonation, smooth and drinkable. Dry finish. 
Overall an outstanding beer. Certainly one of the stronger APAs out there, its still well within the style and a phenomenal showcase of the citra hop. Haters gonna hate, but this is still an amazing beer. 653 charactersFBarber, Mar 30, 2016

4.02/5  rDev -11.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412oz bottle courtesy of the largesse of @Ri0. My first from 3F, and from the state of Indiana. My second Citra-hopped Midwest pale ale of the day. 
This beer was a hazy, orangey amber color, with a big, off-white head that dropped after a few minutes, but left a whole lotta lace on the sides of a Boundary Bay pint glass.
Grapefruity hop nose to this, but not as “juicy” as the PseudoSue I had earlier. 
Tasty, grapefruity hops lead the assault on the tastebuds. There’s a little more of a leafy, tea-like bitterness than PseudoSue, and it’s not quite as bright and mango-y, but still very tasty. The finish is a little softer, a little less dry.
Medium bodied, with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation seems a tad bit lower than PseudoSue, and the mouthfeel is a little less resiny.
I didn’t plan it this way, but what I’ve wound up doing is a near side-by-side comparison of this beer and PseudoSue. Since there’s no freshness date, it’s possible this is a little older than it’s Iowan rival, but I feel like the latter was brighter, more fruity, and maybe a little more hoppy tasting. This is still a great beer, but based on my experience, I’d pick PseudoSue over this if confronted with the choice. Thanks, Ri0! 1,247 characterswoemad, Mar 27, 2016

Some of the Binny's locations only allow you to get one beer, but most let you get only a six pack.  
The lacing is rather nice.  Smells of citrus hops, lemon, lime, orange.  Not bitter for a IPA and well balanced.  Pours a orange and smells of and tastes of citrus.  I am not IPA fan but I find myself always wanting to have this beer on hand despite it being hard to get.  Now have over a case as we went to the brewery yesterday and they were selling it like hotcakes out the door and gone in 1 day.  Despite not loving IPA I think that this beer is one of the best beers I have ever had. 802 charactersmgwagman, Mar 25, 2016

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy yellow orange color with good clarity and vision of tiny bubbles coming up through the glass.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank.
Smell:  Lemony, citrus, herbal, pale, toasted, and biscuity malts.
Taste:  Would have liked more hop flavor, but content with the way it tastes.  Light bitterness and chewy notes in the rear too.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, light bodied, crisp, refreshing, medium carbonation, light light bitterness, and a little chewy. 
Overall:  Pretty nice APA.  Good enough to grab another bottle out of the fridge. 677 charactersFlounder57, Mar 21, 2016

Cloud-like nebulas float around. It smells of tropical fruit: pineapples and oranges. There's also a fresh-cut grass smell that reminds me of spring, a bit flowery. The taste is refreshing, bursts of juicy citrus along with a creamy sensation reminiscent of piña colada with a piney aftertaste. I try to always have a 6 pack in my Chicago fridge. 439 charactersDanny206, Mar 21, 2016

Some citrus and pine, but not a whole lot in the nose.  But the taste - lemons, breadiness, bananas, creaminess.  Flavors hits in waves and lingers.  Crisp bitter finish, with some noticeable alcohol. 
Very solid.  Lives up to hype.  Easily best Pale ale I've had.  Which it were more readily available where I am as I would be a frequent purchaser. 538 charactersKomodoDragon, Mar 18, 2016

A: Very hoppy; citrusy, slightly tropical fruit-like hops with light malt sweetness on the finish.
A:  Light orange/yellow color, totally clear, with a frothy white head that slowly recedes to a film. Lots of lacing in the glass is evident.
T: Clean, bright citrusy hops with a touch of malt sweetness (less sweet than the nose). While hoppy this beer isn’t particularly bitter. 
M: Medium-light body with moderate carbonation 
O: Looks smells and tastes like an IPA - very hoppy indeed, but without the bitterness. Clean and easy to drink! 555 charactersPhil-Fresh, Mar 08, 2016

I have to say that I do not know what all the fuss is about with Zombie Dust. It's really good, but NOT worth fighting over to get it since it's made in limited supply. A better APA and IPA is Deschutes Fresh Squeezed and my all time fave, Brickstone Hop Skip and I'm Drunk IPA. Much more Citra flavor and aroma. 364 charactersMalaka429, Mar 08, 2016

Darker color than I was expecting but that is probably due to the age.  The smell was like any other good pale ale.  Taste was on point and the feel was a little watery tbh.
Would love to try this fresh but even after a month it was very good.  I can see why this beer is sought after but to this extent is a little insane.

4.9/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Sierra Nevada IPA glass. Bottled on 2-22-16, reviewing on 2-29-16
Look: Bright orange appearance. Pours a good 1 1/2 finger head which leaves some lacing as it diminishes. Produces a mixture of fine and large bubbles with a ton streaming from the bottom. Looks amazing in the glass.
Smell: I can smell the hops from the pour without even putting my nose to the glass. Massive hop and citrus aroma on this beer. Smells almost like an IPA but without the sharp bitterness. More of a refined bitterness to the nose that blends well with a small amount of sweetness.
Taste: Taste is bright hops and citrus rind. Hops are unbelievably balanced with the malt sweetness. While the nose had me thinking it was going to be fairly bitter and IPA-esq, I was surprised to find this beer super hoppy without being bitter. An absolutely fantastic, refreshing tasting Pale Ale with everything you look for on the palate.
Overall: I love this beer. While I was expecting a lot due to the hype around this one I was surprised to still find myself extremely impressed. What really does it for me in this beer is the amount of hops present in the taste and aroma but, the lack of bitterness. It has an intense flavor but remains refreshing and clean. Definitely the best pale ale I've had and look forward to picking this up whenever I can. 1,360 charactersThat_Bearded_Guy, Mar 01, 2016

A - heavy pour into a snifter. Slightly hazy copper colored with creamy white 1 finger head. Nice lacing.
S - very citrus-y. Lots of butterscotch maltiness too. Lots of lemon and slightly grassy. Smells very, very sweet.
T - wow. Very good. Such a great meddling of highs and lows in this. I love how drinkable and not in your face it is. Not getting the sweetness that I expected from the nose, but it's in no way a hopped up bomb either. Just a nice drinking pale ale. Well done. 
M - Dear God. Creamiest ipa/apa I've ever had. Almost perplexingly so. Is this nitro'd and I just don't know it?
O - very great. I hate to side with hype but this sucker probably deserves it. 695 charactersrypkr, Mar 01, 2016

Overall - Been waiting for this one for a while now. Its great but I've had better. And personally don't even think it's 3 Floyds best pale ale. I'd pick Space Station Middle Finger over this any day. 400 charactersTonyjenlasc, Feb 22, 2016

This beer is so smooth with a great fruity flavor and a slight bitterness at the end.  It coats your mouth leaving you with a juicy hop feeling.

S - Amazingly delicious aroma. Citrus and....cotton candy. Very sweet and tropical.
T - Citrusy on the front end followed by a dry, bitter taste. The hops are the main reason for the bitterness but it felt a little over-carbed.
F - Speaking of, this beer is heavily carbed. Medium body with a lot of bubbles.
Overall - This was my first "hard to find" beer (at least in my mind). Given the hype I was disappointed. This is a very solid pale ale, with a fantastic aroma and good hop flavoring but when you're expecting a mind blowing beer...nope. Put this in a blind lineup with some other good, but not great pale ales/IPAs and I think this might blend in with the rest. Pseudo Sue is my measuring stick for top notch pale ales and this isn't in the same category. Again, a solid pale ale - but not worth the hype. 876 charactersmke_Brewer, Feb 17, 2016

Def not disappointed.
Look- crystal clear with small white head.  Great lacing on the glass
Smell-  this is a pale ale, so I did not expect IPA aroma, but it was damn close.  Perfect for style.
Taste- Smooth all around.  Great lingering citrus taste.  Very sessionable beer.  
Feel-  Creamy mouthfeel.    Really goes down nice and easy.
Overall-   Usually not a a big Pale Ale guy, but this one is really exceptional.  Could pound 5-6 of these consecutively very easily.    Worth the hype 547 charactersjcflorian, Feb 05, 2016

A: The beer is a deep gold color with a thin white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains a very nice blend of floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out with a nice burst of grassy hops bitterness that is quickly followed by sweet flavors of caramel and citrus. The malt character is a bit on the thin side for the style but it works quite well in this beer and provides an excellent balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is quite clean.
O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to drink for a long time. 830 charactersTheManiacalOne, Feb 05, 2016

Sometimes I wish people would just get all into a different beer so this would be easier to find. Like countless other reviews have said, this beer is hoppy but also super drinkable. The thing that sets this apart for me is the aftertaste, you get a really good initial flavor followed by the Three Floyds kind of earthy/resin aftertaste. Can't wait to go visit the brewery. One of the best out there. People in the Milwaukee area: I heard sour beers are cool, buy those and leave this on the shelf for me. Thanks in advance. 605 charactersWebzombie, Jan 29, 2016

This year a true 5.0.

Smell and taste is....... Nectar of the gods.
Give it a taste after testing any other brew and 
"welcome home" comes to mind.

M: Solid silky feeling, lingering bitterness
O:  Beer was enjoyed in a Pint glass, and I must say it didn’t stick around long enough to get warm. Great mouth feel silky deliciousness that I don’t often find in a pale ale often. 507 charactersRevrynd, Jan 22, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I have had this a few times and I am finally writing an official review from notes.
L- light golden, bronze. 
S- Huge aromas of orange, grapefruit and tangerine. 
T- Sweet orange and grapefruit citrus followed by  bitterness on a light biscuity malt base, this is one of the best beer to showcase Citra I have ever had (on par with Pseudo Sue)
F- Juicy yet crisp at the same time. Not much residual sweetness left, yet the beer itself taste semi-sweet and juicy. So I guess starts sweet and ends semi-dry (my favorite)
O- This thing is a true gem fresh and the best on tap.  This beer has taught me something I hadn't experienced called "anti-hype" it's when a beer that is hard to get gets pooped on by locals because it has hype. To me that is almost worse than hype. I have had people tell me all these other beers are "better" but objectively speaking this beer is one of the best APA's I have ever had and comes close to the best hoppy beer I have had period(.) Very good and worth the high ratings IMO. 1,009 charactersCO-Bloom, Jan 19, 2016

I think PtE has it beat in terms of balance and flavor profile. With that being said, Zombie Dust is still a contender. It's an easy drinker loaded with hops. 377 charactersBiggtriksta, Jan 11, 2016

Look: Pours an amazing golden/orangish color.  Nice head retention with plenty of lacing present.
Smell:  Citrusy, hoppy, fruity, grapefruity.
Taste:  Citra hops galore really hop up this pale ale.  This thing is dank and awesome.  Citrusy and fruity tasting.  Super crisp.
Feel: Medium bodied.  Crisp and soo refreshing!
Overall:  This is hands down the best pale ale that I have ever tasted.  Lives up to the hype in my opinion.  Alpha King not far behind though.  So far have had 4 different brews from these guys and all have been great.  Seems like these guys can't miss. 649 characterstrygelski1, Jan 10, 2016

4.19/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Pours golden orange with short lasting white head. Aroma of citrus and that tel-tale Citra fruitiness with malt and slight nutty bisquit thing going on. The flavors are the same with good balance and a touch of sweetness. The feel is on the higher end of light, with a slight creaminess on the finish. Carbonation is moderate. Overall a great beer, but honestly not living up to the hype for me. We have local APAs / IPAs (Richmond, VA)  most of you have not heard of that crush this IMO. Great beer though, don't hesitate. 523 charactersStolenface1, Jan 08, 2016

4.91/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75From a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. 
Pour is hazy gold in color with tints of orange
Smell is citrus and hops. Strong aromas for sure. Underneath maybe some herby earthy notes as well
Taste is full flavor hops and a plesent mixture of citrus fruit. I've never had a beer with this much hops and full body that was as smooth and easy drinking. This flavor profile is out of this world
Overall this beer lives up to its lofty reputation. I personally am very cautious about giving 5's in a review. If this beer doesn't get a few then no beer should. 554 charactersGear54, Jan 03, 2016

The ever famous citra hop shines through. Notes of orange also come through. Got this one when it was bottled 12 days ago. Great beer!

4.37/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25I had the opportunity to visit FFF over the holidays.  I went in completely unassuming.  I live out of state and haven't experienced any of their beer.  I  would consider myself having above average knowledge of the craft world, and I enjoy a variety of styles, but I'm a hop-head first and foremost.  First thing I noticed was the sign on the brewpub door that said "No Zombie Dust."  This was the carry-out section of the brewery.  My party went inside to eat and we put a name in with the host.  We were told 20-25 minutes.  They didn't have anywhere we could have a beer while we waited (major bummer), so we went and looked at merch.  Cool stuff, if you're in to the comic/metal scene.  I could take it or leave it, but I can still appreciate the creativity behind it all.  We were called to a table after 20 minutes and immediately ordered flights (Alpha King, Alpha Klaus, Gumballhead, and Robert the Bruce).  We also ordered full pints of Zombie Dust.  My initial thought was this would be an IPA.  I didn't realize it was an APA until I read about it several sips into the glass.  We knew immediately this was a special beer.  The citra hops release a very pleasant, and strong aroma.  A fresh citrus front end with a heavy-hop finish was all I remember of the first half of my glass, it went down that easy.  Extremely drinkable is the best way to describe this.  You would not peg this beer to be 6%+.  The girls all agreed this was very good and we rarely connect on the same beer.  I will agree that much of the allure comes from the scarcity of this label, but it's still world class.  I put it on a similar level as Maine MO which I think is excellent, too.  I give the edge to ZD on taste and also price..  Cases were $40, tax included, which I see is up from $35 from a few years ago.  I was surprised it wasn't more expensive, quite frankly.  MO was at Total Wine recently for $9.99 for a 16oz bottle.  ZD breaks down to a $10 six pack which is a tremendous deal for what you're getting.  Granted, this is brewery pricing, so I could be wrong..  My overall opinion is that it's a top tier beer and the desirability is a lot of fun when you have some and your friends don't. 2,191 charactersMike_BA_Reviews, Dec 28, 2015

4.83/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5All around, Zombie Dust is an exceptional American Pale Ale, showcasing the best of the Citra Hop.  While TG's Psuedosue is very similar and even has a little more complexity of taste than it (have done side-by-sides numerous times), Zombie Dust always takes the cake with its balance, approachability and citrusy goodness.  
While it remains my favorite APA and even IPA (lines are blurred a bit with ZD), it needs to be enjoyed fresh as the smell/taste fades quickly and becomes almost a different beer after 4 weeks.  This is my only knock on it. Usually not a problem at retail as these brews move quickly. 611 charactersRBMurphy4, Dec 23, 2015

3.41/5  rDev -24.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.25Perfect, sparkling amber, with a large beige head that leaves behind a nice, thin blanket.
Catty pine and grapefruit aromas--this is kicked up a zillion notches from what one should expect from an "APA"--I don't know how this isn't just classified as an IPA but man is this powerful. There are some funky, musty elements from the hops at time, such as rug, copper, and a little visit from the allium family.
Tastes like grapefruit candy, with cracker and light pine. There is a hint of graham, bringing back some memories of Permanent Funeral, one of my favorites, but it's far in the background. Otherwise, some caramel malt is also present.
Zombie Dust is actually quite balanced compared to the nose, and even a little sweet compared to how I remember myself having it for the first time so long ago, thinking it was such a tongue searing bitter monstrosity. I've had far more imposing hop bombs than this, but it still has a good bitter kick if you're not used to or ready for it. 987 charactersSabtos, Dec 20, 2015

4.25/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours a dark golden orange color with tangerine edges and a two finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring.  Excellent retention, taking a while to settle and coating the glass with large streaks of soapy lacing.
Dank floral hop aroma with earthy resins and freh cut grass countered by sweet citrus/tropical fruit and a pale malt backbone.  Grassy pine and dank buds along with grapefruit, pineapple and blood orange zest.  Really nice sweeter counterbalance to the bitter earthiness.  Pale malts evident without hindering the hop character with notes of biscuit and grainy cracker.  Smells pretty good.
Medium body but on the full side for a pale ale.  Blast of dry, earthy bitterness up front that lingers over the sweeter hop notes and pale malt backbone into a crisp, dry finish.  Grassy pine, spruce tip and dank, sticky resins followed by a nice tropical/citrus fruit presence.  Some tart ruby red grapefruit, pineapple and zesty orange peel.  Pale malt with subtle caramel sweetness, toffee, light toast, biscuit and grainy graham cracker.  Malts are stronger than expected but don't interfere with the excellent hop flavors.  Instead, they provide great balance and contribute to the drinkability of this crushable beer.  The bitterness is just so dank and flavorful without being too strong or overpowering.  Another very nice beer from Three Floyds. 1,390 characterscorby112, Dec 09, 2015

The star is definitely the nose.  It's one of those beers that after popping the top you go around to any adult in sight screaming "Oh my gosh, you have to smell this."  A lovely citrus bouquet.  This is without a doubt the most fragrant pale ale I have ever had.  Great carbonation and mouthfeel.

4.3/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a pale orange color with a thumb sized cream colored head.
Nose is lots of hop aromas citrus and tropical fruits with good doses of pine thrown in for good measure. Defiantly a 3 Floyds nose on this one. Malt is muted by hops but does offer some sweetness to the nose.
Taste is fairly bitter hops right away citrus with lingering pine bitterness. The fruity notes in the nose seem to be overrun or non existent in the flavor. There is a burst of carbonation at first sip that tends to lay the pine resin on your tongue. The malt also comes out in the finish along with lingering pine and dryness. A solid Pale Ale no doubt but maybe little over hyped for me, as i  was expecting nirvana.
Mouthfeel  is light with a burst of carbonation to lay down all the alpha acids.
Overall a fairly solid Pale Ale that could pass for an IPA. But for those who haven't had it don't worry too much about it is not the Holy Grail by any means. That being said TY Tara for bringing me a 12 pack back with you from your visit with the family. 1,034 charactersmntlover, Nov 27, 2015

Light orange to honey under a slight tan foam that settles after a few moments to a thin layer of bubbles.  The head clings to the glass in a thick band that leaves a globby lace.  The nose is deeply citric with pine resin on the background with an underlying sweetness that suggests brown sugar.  Juicy citric hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness that turns bitter turning to dry.  Perfect carbonation with a dry mouth and a light, pleasant lingering hop fueled bitterness.  Overall I can see why this one gets such high marks,  this is a great beer!  Big thanks to Abu for the bottle! 627 charactersypsifly, Nov 19, 2015

4.2/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25On draft in a tulip. Nice orange color with small amount of lacing. Nose is not that robust - I get the citra for sure, but it is a bit muted by the malt. Taste is much better - great play back and forth between hops and malt. Citra is a fickle hop - too much or not balanced and it gets pissy. This one hits that balance well. The finish is great - the body and yeast leave a pleasant, almost dry linger. 
This is a very good beer. Maybe not living up to the hype in my opinion, but still a great, easy drinking, and unique pale ale. 535 characterssoze47, Nov 14, 2015

A - Poured a cloudy orange with a very lackluster head, almost non existent. The head there died down almost immediately.
S - A nose full of citrus with mixed fruit, tropical pineapple?
T - Tons of citrus from the get go that mellows after a few seconds to maybe even a very little piney note.
M- There was a medium mouth feel, very smooth and pleasant.
O - Thankfully the flavors were there. This was a good beer, but I have a feeling the fresh one I have next time will really shine. To no fault of the breweries own. 681 charactersKEEPonPOURING, Nov 14, 2015

I have had a small sample of this before, and will balance that tasting with this review.
Appearance is more orange than gold, decent head on pour, receding to the edges, but quick to return with agitation.  Beer is cloudy to being almost opaque initially, some clearing.
Nose is lightly dank on this pour, I recall it being stronger on my previous sample.  Some amount of resiny pine still comes through with grapefruit and maybe some pineapple notes.
Taste is nice, not balanced but appears that way.  Mostly sticking to the classic citrus notes, but backed up by the green grapefruit pith, almost dank, bitterness Citra can give off.  The citrus comes through a little more in this pour than I recall from my tasting.
Nice carbonation, medium body, enjoyable feel overall.
A very well made APA that definitely bleeds into IPA territory.  Will always welcome this beer when I get a chance. 978 characterscjgiant, Oct 25, 2015

I'm guessing that's the bottle on date and not the best by date. Still over 4 months old :c foggy gold with bubbly head that recedes quickly leaving sparse lacing. Decent amount of carb bubbles. Smell is biscuit, grass, bready malt, and some pine. Taste is very well balanced with the same flavors. Leaves slight dry stickyness on the palate and fades quickly but a decent aftertaste lurks.

4.81/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I am a HUGE fan of Zombie Dust.  This rating is based on having it dozens of times (at the brewery, from the bottle, on tap) and every single time I am really impressed with it. 
The balance of this beer is what really makes it shine… Hop bitterness is medium, if not on the low side of the spectrum (at least the perceived bitterness). The citra hops deliver wonderful flavor and that tropical aroma.
It is just a very well made beer all around… It does drop off quick in the bottle, so be sure to drink as fresh as you can get it. 538 charactersinvertalon, Oct 21, 2015
4.31/5  rDev -4.9%look: 2.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled 10Sep15) into a Mikasa ale glass.
LOOK: Pours with a half finger's worth of white foam that shrivels into a line after 20 seconds. Honey orange in color. Rising bubbles are small in size and very scarce in quantity. Lacing is thin and subtle.
SMELL: Has strong aromas of citrusy hops that entangle with mild aromas of sweet bready malts, floral hops, oranges, mangos, grapefruits, papayas, peaches, and apricots.
TASTE: Strong flavors of citrusy hops and mild flavors of sweet bready malts first strike my palate. Mild fruit flavors mentioned in the smell enter right after. As all malt and hop flavors persist, but fruit flavors grow slightly stronger, subtle bitter hop flavors finish off this incredible symphony of flavors.
FEEL: Medium-bodied and highly carbonated. Goes down rough and finishes with a moderate dryness.
NOTE: An incredible beer that smelled and tasted wonderful. The mouthfeel and appearance really brought down the overall rating, though. 996 charactersMyotus, Oct 19, 2015

Regardless, this lives up to all the hype! Smooth, well-balanced, and extremely drinkable, Three Floyds hit a walk-off home run with this one! 447 charactersTheRougeBastard, Oct 18, 2015

Pours a brilliant burnt orange color with a thick head. My nose receives a heavy dose of citra- the odor is not mistakable. Heavy aroma from the head - Classic citra hints citrus, grapefruit, etc. very little earthiness to this beer. Hint of caramel as well. Taste is unbelievable. Tops PseudoSue in my mind. Perfect balance of malt roast to citra quality. Excellent beer. One of the best I've had to date. 437 charactersthorkelson, Oct 17, 2015

A:  Pours a clear copper with 1" white head that recedes somewhat quickly.  Retention is really quite good, lacing is above-average.
S:  Pungent citrus rind & a bit of a spice note, mainly black pepper.  Grapefruit is present.  Fresh-baked bread.  Not bad, but not terribly deep.
T:  Comes on with a burst of orange-rind & some bready sweetness to temper it.  Mid palate features a mellow-but-noticeable bitterness punctuated by an undefined citrus quality.  The finish is decidedly maltier, with more of a bready character & a touch of lemon zest at the end.
M:  Moderate carb married to a somewhat heavy but very dry, almost chalky body.  More than big enough to support the flavors here, maybe even a skootch too much.
O:  Very, very good hopped-up Pale. 791 charactersMUTINY, Oct 15, 2015

A - Nice burnt orange colour. Hazy. One finger of white head on top. Mild carbonation. Spotty lace and a film of retention. 
S - Melon, pineapple, passionfruit. Smells like citra! A little grass. Sweet fruit. 
T - Mild alcohol note, citra all over the place. More pineapple and passionfruit, earthy and grassy too. Citrusy zip. The bitterness is a really nice drying note that isn't always done so subtly, yet intensely. 
M - Medium body, good sharp bitterness and a mild carbonation. 
O/D - This isn't mind blowing. It's a pale ale with a ton of citra in it. It's damn good, but I'm not gonna blow a load over it like so many others. Tasty stuff and very sessionable, just not jaw dropping. Also, a pale ale shouldn't have 60 IBUs and I don't understand why this is recognized as such. 816 charactersbylerteck, Oct 04, 2015

A: has a beautiful golden color with a full foamy head that disapates with time. 
S: When i smelled my sample i was hit with a fragrane of citris. Pine needles and orange peels.
T: This beer is made with a single hop (citra hop). When it hits the lips so good.

A: Pours a beautiful amber color with a big 2 finger head that simmered down nicely to a film atop the beverage. Lacing is very good all the way to the bottom.
S: As soon as I popped the cap off the fresh 12 oz bottle I was punched in the face by immense citrus notes. Very pungent. 
T: Well, this is perfectly balanced. The hop flavor hits first; a blast of citrus and pine. A bit later, the malt backbone shows up and is perfect.
M: Goes down super smooth. This is super drinkable. Finish is crisp and putting this thing away is too easy a task. Superb. 
O: This gets tons of hype, and legitimately lives up to it. The best APA I've had by a large margin. 769 charactersGreasy, Sep 24, 2015

Honestly, to say it is one of the finest pale ales in the country would be doing it a disservice. While being classified as a pale ale, I would think this is more of a super tasty IPA. You get lots of tropical fruit aromas from the Citra hops utilized in the brewing process. Taste is somewhat subtle but has an effective bite after your first sip. Overall, awesome beer and worth seeking out, cheers! 456 characterstregan_20, Sep 18, 2015

4.02/5  rDev -11.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Happy 100th review for me, so I better pick a big beer to do it.
Pours clear with no haze and medium-amber with some nice lacing.
Smell is grapefruit, with a good dose of pine and some honey.  Definitely got a West-coast style thing going on.
Taste reveals a lot more character, and is oddly a bit more East-coast style than the smell suggests.  Bitter, dry, more pine, less fruit, and a fairly thin texture.  Strange kind of metallic bitterness on the back end, which is what stays with you in the aftertaste.
It's a good IPA, no doubt about that.  Interesting, tasty, worth trying.  Unfortunately for me, I've been on such a high-rated IPA kick lately that by comparison to stuff like Pliny, Heady, Lagunitas Sucks, Stone's 19th, etc., this one doesn't hold my interest as much as I would have liked it to.  If you're expecting a world class IPA as its reputation indicates, you'll be disappointed.  If you're expecting a damn good midwestern IPA that you will wholeheartedly enjoy, go for it.  Just don't try toooo hard to find it. 1,038 charactersjmasher85, Sep 16, 2015

Overall a solid beer but prefer Alpha King since it has a bigger malt presence if I'm going to get a pale ale from 3 Floyds. 313 charactersmcrawford, Sep 12, 2015

Pours a deep straw/light honey color with an off white head.  The nose is very hop-forward, and nearly as dry as it tastes.  This beer is simply great to drink.  The taste is dry, hoppy, and very refreshing.  Very little malt-sweetness that I can detect.  This is all dry, all hop, which is likely why it tastes so much more like an IPA than a pale ale.  Mouthfeel is exceedingly crisp.  Overall, and outstanding beer. 480 charactersLAp, Sep 12, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5L - deep and dark. You sure this is a pale ale? Looks more like a DIPA. Creamy head that has lasting power, but eventually dies down like all good beers. Entrancing. 
S - wonderfully rich and complex. I can smell the artful hop balance from here, peppered with malty spicy notes. Probably the best part about this beer. 
T - the true definition of perfect balance. Nothing is particularly overwhelming, but isn't that the point? These guys went with a pale ale and knocked it out of the park. More impressive than a lot of DIPAs that have this beat in all categories simply because it accomplishes what 3 Floyds set out to do so well. Strong malt backbone. Editing this because after I let it sit, I'm getting a potent mango-centric punch up front. Nice. +.25
F - I had a lot of trouble rating the mouthfeel simply because every time I took a sip with mouthfeel in mind, I kept getting distracted by the flavor. So rich, lightly floral, yet aggressive tingly hops all with a smooth malt bill in full force from beginning to end. Godammit, there I go again! Right, the mouthfeel! Creamy and saturating. Coats the entire mouth, seeping into every pore (do mouths have pores?)
O - nothing more to say other than this is art. Beautifully crafted beer that doesn't try to be the biggest, baddest beer of them all. So many big beers in the top 250; it's refreshing to see such a well-deserved beer stick to its roots and perfect a relatively bland style. 1,452 charactersagreenman19, Sep 01, 2015

This being one of my first adventure into beer reviewing I will try to avoid butchering it. This APA pours a radiant hazy orange color with a finger head that leaves nice tracing the way down. The smell (my favorite part) hits you with an a one two with sweet malts and tropical fruit. The taste matches the smell very well but is followed up with a hint of bitterness. It has a superb mouth feel that balances a full body flavor and retains its refreshing qualities. My overall opinion on this beer is obviously 3 floyds has knocked it out of the park again. This is one of the best APAs in the business. There may be some that are better out there but this is definitely top 3. 707 charactersMikeCooke, Aug 27, 2015

In taste, it has all the hallmarks of a top tier APA, but is too tightly wound IMO. It does open up a bit as it warms, but the bitter bite overrights many of the appealing, subtler notes, which ultimately detract for my taste. That said, it has amazing personality for a single hop APA and is a tribute to it brewers. If it was in my distro I'd keep a ready supply on hand. 425 charactersMCCarrigan, Aug 11, 2015

The nose is full of citra invoking some fruity lemony citrus and some tropical fruits. I think the bottle was only a week old at most.

L- pours a hazy orange with about a finger of white head that quickly fades leaving some lacing
A- reeks of Citra hops! Strong tropical smell (mango I think is what I'm mostly picking up)
T- no really strong particular flavors here, just some mild tropical fruit and bitterness
M- good mouth feel, average carbonation 
O- it's a good decent beer, I love a beer that reminds me of a bag of hops, but the flavor was lacking. It may just be an older bottle. I will definitely revisit this one in the future and see if it lives up to the hype. Definitely prefer pseudosue over this. 759 charactersKelz87, Aug 09, 2015

4.67/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A - A fine, eggshell, two-finger head forms at the top of my cup, and it looks to have some very solid staying power (and so it does, even as she nears completion, the beer still has a good centimeter of foam holding strong). The coloration is an opaque amber, with bits of light orange and yellow lining the perimeter. Lacing is present to a certain extent.
S - Oh my. Just delightfully fruity, with almost a tropical fruityness. Peach, pineapple--HUGE pineapple actually--grapefruit, with some pear and caramel in there as well. Smells just divine, I barely even want to drink the thing it smells so nice. It's  a big smell to be sure, and it is right on.
T - That is fiiiine just fine. There is a little bit of bitterness and fruitiness with the malt establishing a clear presence now as well. There's some orange peel on there to be sure, grapefruit, maybe even a little bit of tangerine all of it wrapped up in a kind of musty resiny goodness that is complex and subtle and refined. Just a fantastic flavor that changes a little bit with each sip and each degree change in temperature.
M - Mouth feel is smooth, lightly dry, and just a little bit bitter. Feels very fine indeed.
O - Outstanding beer, and a courageous example of an American Pale Ale, probably the best of the style I've ever encountered. Definitely lives up to the hype in my mind and then some. Big time tip of the cap to 3 floyds, they just only know how to produce stupendous beers. 1,461 charactersKKB, Aug 02, 2015

4.41/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Draft at pies&pints; nonic pint. (Re-reviewed 7-27-16, bottle dated 7-19-16!)
Appearance: clear pale orange with 1 finger (3 fingers) bright white (just off-white) head. Little visible carb, not much retention (excellent retention of 1/8 inch of foam) Very nice lacing.
Aroma: tropical and resin; nothing distinct, but more potent than white rajah or sculpin.  (Peach, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, kumquat, light white bread hint of sweetness)
Taste: light tart arrival, bold hoppy citrus mid-palate; incredibly light and fresh. Bitter finish, but cleans up really quickly; little residual bitterness. (Immediate hoppy grapefruit, citrus, and resinous arrival with a tough more of a crackery malt than I remembered on draft. On mid palate the hops keep coming on strong, but are balanced by a hint of malty sweetness. There is a lingering, pleasant and citric bitterness on the finish).
Mouthfeel: light to mid bodied; little (moderate) carb; clean as can be, with no astringency.
Overall: perhaps the world's best "patio beer." Hoppier than any pale I've ever had and most IPAs, but hoppiness does not linger. Kind of like an IPL. A lot like southern tier live. Would drink this everyday May to September if possible. (Still true, but in a word: finesse. This beer is bold without being overpowering. That is a tremendous balancing act and this executes perfectly. I'd call it an IPA, though.) 1,400 charactersSaltofOH, Aug 01, 2015

4.62/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Look - A light amber color, translucent; small amount of head
Smell - It's a good thing smell doesn't always correlate to taste in beers because the smell of this is a little underwhelming (read: mild)
Taste - In your mouth is where this beer shines, while the look and smell aren't anything special, this is one of the better American pale ale's and the taste is excellent.  Very balanced and easy to drink.  Citrusy with a light hop flavor to it.  This one is not bitter at all, but believe me it will still grab your attention at first taste.  Tastes are citrusy with hints of many sweet fruits, with a mild amount of hops and malts
Feel - So smooth - lightly carbonated.  Goes down easily.
Overall - Smooth and complex without being overwhelming.  Great balance and a great beer. 787 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Jul 31, 2015

4.09/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Have to be careful and rate this one as an APA as it's definitely one of those fringe offerings that blurr the line a little bit. I only review pales if I had the chance to try them within a month of bottling and though this one barely made the cutoff I was still a little disappointed how quickly this one faded (can only assume degradation given the numerous high reviews). The typical citra profile gave way to a more grassy profile but I did enjoy the malt profile, bready and light without much lingering sweetness. Still a great beer just wish I had it younger, will be on the hunt for more to give this the review it really deserves. 640 charactersVetsPackage, Jul 28, 2015

The flavor is very floral hoppy but well balanced with a smooth finish. This is my 4th time drinking this beer and the first time I really enjoyed it. As a pale ale its great, but only as a pale ale. This beer has grown on me, it just has too much hype. 344 charactersStevem68, Jul 28, 2015

Definitely best tasting single hopped pale ale I've ever had.  The only APA that I've had that's been better is HF's Edward, but they are totally different tasting beers with different profiles.  The hype surrounding this beer is legit.  I can still practically taste it a day or two later.  This could totally be a desert island beer for me. 411 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Jul 26, 2015

Smells of sublime bitter, fruity lemon zest with balancing, white-bread malts to it. Citrus got a flowery, inviting note to it, enhancing the beers juicy, ripe lime pulp impression. 
Drinks outstandingly easy, with a medium, soft carbonation to it, resulting into a very pleasant, citrus forward pale ale. 
Tastes of citrus peel from the very beginning, while the malts provide a fantastic soft mouthfeel, exhibiting a hint of honey, as well as juicy lime. Also yields a soft minerality, creating a very clean and crisp hop profile, showcasing the pungent exotic fruit perfectly. Finishes with biscuity malts  among an aqueous softness and pleasantly metallic carbonation, together with a well weaved in citrus hoppiness, which shines during the very end of tasting the beer.
While its hoppiness provides a pleasant assault on the tongue it is perfectly integrated and balanced by all other ingredients of the beer. This creates a great softness on the palate, resulting in an outstandingly easy drinking beer, for which you don't necessary need to be a hophead, more of a beer which convinces you to be one. 1,177 charactersaleigator, Jul 23, 2015

The beer is a wonderfully delicious pale ale that deserves it's high marks. I'm not a reviewer that can tell you all the hops and smells and flavors.

4.89/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.7512 oz. bottle (2015-06-12) poured into a tall FSB highball glass.
A - Pours a glistening pale straw.  A three-finger head of very tight, pillowy foam that's eggshell white very slowly collapses, leaving generous rings of foam around the glass.  Held to a full-spectrum light, the beer is a rich yellow-gold that moves toward orange in the middle and quite hazy, making it rather opaque.
S - Solid nose of fresh ruby red grapefruit hops.  A hint of resin in support.  Into the glass, softer citrus notes emerge with floral hops in the background.  Malt is bready - moist whole wheat with just a touch of very light caramel candy.
T - Delicious lightly toasted malt topped by orange/grapefruit jam and garnished by fresh floral notes.  Just a hint of Jolly Rancher candy surrounded by somewhat bitter herbal notes in the rather soft finish.
M - Somewhat fizzy with a nice crispness that slides easily across the tongue.  Well-balanced carbonation.  Medium-light body complements the nicely integrated, quality components.  Clean, short finish.
O - Now this is my idea of a pale ale - a perfectly matched malt foundation balanced against an outstanding combination of hops.  It delivers both an enjoyable, sensuous experience for the taste buds while also being clean and refreshing.  More - lots more - please.  This one 12 oz. bottle was just a tease. 1,355 charactersBuckeyeSlim, Jul 08, 2015

Flavor was nicely balanced between make and hops with both caramel sweetness and citrusy hop flavors coming through, even in the finish.  More like IPA than APA I think but still a great beer. 381 charactersrjmc64, Jul 04, 2015

Drank more like an IPA than what I've come to expect from pale ales; bold citrusy hops and a robust malt backbone with lots of character. Darker amber color than I expected, and the sweet biscuity malt profile compliments the citra hops well. Bursting with flavor throughout, with a delicate dry/sweet finish. Left me wanting to take another sip immediately after the last one. 429 charactersshangwang, Jul 02, 2015

Balanced, juicy, clean. Poured a clear, orange amber color with 2 fingers of loose white head. Just a giant orange/tangerine aroma, citrus madness, finished off by just a hint of a dank hop note in there as well. Big orange juice on the palate, sweet tangerine, a hint of pine, and a hint of sweetness moving back on the tongue. Excellent balance is the key to this flavor profile. An overall dry finish that carries the juicy hoppiness along, cut with that hint of sweetness just nicely. Fantastic beer. 604 charactersMikus, Jul 01, 2015

An inch of soapy white head sits atop this sandy gold beer. 
Big nose - lots of citrus and mango, hint of pine. Really great, distinctive. 
With a name like "Zombie," you'd think this was going to be a monster, but it's much more delicate than that. Juicy citrus, a little bit dank, somewhat vegetative. Sits on the tongue like a leather flap, holding fast. 
A good beer, but there's hype in the name. 521 charactersmdcrouser, Jun 20, 2015

12 oz. bottle into a Duvel glass. Pours a light gold and settles a clear amber in the glass. Excellent carbonation. A semi-aggressive pour yielded about 2 fingers of sticky, white foam. Very aromatic - one of those beers you can smell from a couple feet away. Tropical fruit, citrus, pine, and hops on the nose. Medium-light weight, and quite smooth on the mouthfeel. There's a slight hoppy bitterness up front with a strong malt backbone. Notes of tropical fruit are present, but are somewhat muted by the hops and malt. Fairly constant taste throughout. Finishes crisp and clean, and leaves a malty sweetness and a slight hop zest behind for the aftertaste.
Overall, a very good pale ale that's unquestionably drinkable and super tasty. While I don't quite understand all the hype surrounding this particular beer, it does offer a great balance and drinkability that a lot of other pale ales fail to achieve. Damn good. 1,018 charactersdo_ob, Jun 18, 2015

A: citrus, mango, and a slight grainy sweetness behind all those flavoring hops. 
A: Burnt orange with wispy off white head which dissapates quickly but keeps a wonderful carb. Very cloudy but that's to style.
F: Low hop bitterness @ 1st then mango sweetness, slight mild piney  stickiness, and finished with a clean malty backbone. Aftertaste is bittering  hops with some lingering mango flavor. 
M: Light to medium light body, good carb, perfect to style.
O: Again, I understand the hype and recommend everyone to drink and rate this beer, hell I like it more than Pliny. But living in SD there are so many good pale ales and ipa's that are easily accessible I'll stick with them. An awesome beer but won't  be actively searching this one out again. 822 charactersd3brewing, Jun 07, 2015

4.11/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Drank 18 days from bottling date, served at ~40F. Served in a small snifter.
A: Pours a dark orange/gold color. Half a finger of head that fades somewhat quickly. Not a lot of apparent carbonation. Nice see through without any cloudiness.
S: Orange citrus, pineapple, grapefruit, malty sweetness. Some pine in the background. Faint herbal notes.
T: Grapefruit/orange upfront, not a lot of bitterness. Bready/malty sweetness takes over in the middle mouth and finishes with touches of pine and a faint bitterness. 
M: Low to medium mouthfeel. Drinks very easily without much bite from the carbonation or the hops. Dry finish but a lingering aftertaste. 
O: Very good to excellent American Pale Ale. I do not agree that this is in the weight class of the elite beers, but it is worth seeking out as a great take on the style. I like the appearance better than Pseudo Sue, but I prefer the juicy hop character you get with Sue a lot more. There's a bit of a disparity between user ratings and the Bros, and I think it's probably somewhere in between. Its awesome to have the luxury of comparing top tier beers from across the country. 1,132 characterschrisjws, Jun 07, 2015
4.46/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a cloudy orange-amber color with a decent head of white perched atop. Retention is, at best, decent. Starts at nearly an inch but drops to a thickish film within a minute or so leaving very little lacing scattered around the glass.
Smell is a great balance of floral/herbal hops and malt and a hint of citrus. Not wide-ranging but balanced.
Taste is similar, strong hops (floral & herbal), good malt, some pepper and citrus, mostly grapefruit. Balance is good.
A bit too hoppy for a pale ale, but perfectly normal for a non-"West Coast" style IPA. Body is a bit over medium, effervescence is restrained but not muted. Some warming with a dry finish. Quite quaffable. Get some and enjoy. 692 charactersPorterLambic, Jun 07, 2015

Look: Hazy Straw. Nothing wrong here.
Smell: Very fresh, nice for the heat, but not really any fruit notes.
Taste: a bit bready. Good hop presence, but a bitter finish that lingers longer than I would expect for a pale.
Feel: clean and crisp.
This is a fine pale, but when you take in to consideration its rarity versus it's taste (not talking cost) it honestly isn't anything to write home about. If someone offered me one over a bud light, sure I'd take it. But there is a lot of good stuff being produced here in Ohio that I don't have to wait in line for to get that is on the same level. Another good beer from FFF, but definitely one that I would rather trade away than trade for. 786 charactersKain05, Jun 03, 2015

Smell: citrus fruit and bright hops
Taste: C hops are forefront, but bubblegum sweetness is a close second! Comparable to A Little Sumpin' Sumpin Ale regarding bubblegum notes. Unfortunately, orange and grapefruit hops overpower any malts, leaving little little balance between the two. 
Feel: frothy, somewhat dry, and a little buttery
Overall: Glad to try such an esteemed beer! Wish there was more complexity to talk about, but that's unnecessary. This simple brew showcases 3 Floyd's capability to brew a great APA with simple ingredients.

Look: Nice amber color with a good white head.
Smell: Luscious pine and citrus with floral notes. Hints of pineapple on the back end. slight malty notes.
Taste: Piney, slight to moderate maltyness and well balanced
Feel: Butter smooth, touch of body, clean finish
Overall: I really like this pale ale. In my top 2. 1 being Trillum. Was lucky to get this one so fresh. If you get a chance defiantly try it. The fresher the better. 504 charactersFly_Moe, May 21, 2015

And to say the least it did not disappoint. Great head with light lacing poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. Extremely hoppy beer with a little sweetness and just the right bitterness that falls off quickly to balance it out perfect. This is a great beer for any IPA fan even though it's just a pale ale it's hopped to hell and back with Citra hops and it shows on the nose and taste of floral and hoppiness. 554 charactersexposd, May 19, 2015

There is a near, almost mythical reputation about this particular IPA that I have been actively seeking it out. To my surprise, I actually found it on tap. I cannot say if the bottle version is as good but the glass I had yesterday was the best IPA that I've ever experienced. Despite it's strength, it is surprisingly smooth without losing characteristics which IPA's are known. This is one beer worth seeking out and do not fear its price tag, it is well worth the coin. 591 charactersgmossii, May 17, 2015

The smell is sweet with citric hops, honey, fruit candy and tree sap.
The taste is sweet with some perfume and lots of hops. Medium bitterness. Floral notes and resin. Medium body. Smooth malty aftertaste with green plants, some alcohol. The somewhat harsh finish is sticky with some tree sap. 
The carbonation is strong, the mid-smooth bubbles are long-lived. The liquid is somewhat light. 
Not bad at all, but not as fantastic as I had expected. 520 charactersbark, May 16, 2015

4.42/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5First off, the bottle is amazing. Holy artwork Batman!! The bottle cap is by far the most creative one that I have yet to see. 
A: It pours a darker shade of amber in color, tint of orange. Very clear pour with a thin, white head that dissipates into a white lacing.
S: As soon as I cracked open the bottle, it immediately filled my room with an amazing floral/citrusy aroma. I can detect grapefruit, mango, peach, very sweet, perhaps a hint of pine. The aroma is right up there with FPPA by Trillium. However upon pouring it into a glass I was able to detect some malty sweetness.
T: Unlike the nose a bit. I detect some malty sweetness with a dry grapefruit/hoppy kick to it. Slight bitterness. Definitely a combination of sweetness with dry hops. Can't detect citrus notes. Pine is fairly apparent.
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, hops are prickly to the tongue. Slight bitterness, definitely has a dryness to it which leaves the mouth wanting another sip.
O: I finally was able to get my hands on ZD!! It pays to trade I suppose; however despite being bottle fairly recently, (about 2 weeks ago) it's not as citrusy/balanced as Fort Point Pale Ale by Trillium. It's still very good, but I'd have to give it to Trillium. Next APA to try: PseudoSue 1,254 charactersCoffeePorter, May 09, 2015

Not sure if I've had this before when I lived in Indiana, but my first documentation of it.
Amazing aroma for a pale ale.  Blew me away.
Only thing lacking for me was the feel.  It felt thin and everything was quick to dissipate.  Maybe because my bottle is just over a month old but I felt this beer could handle sitting in my cellar for 3 weeks since I purchased it.
Hope to try again soon.  I will definitely seek this out again whenever possible. 472 charactersChris33, May 07, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle into a Sixpoint Teku.
Look - Pours a beautiful burnt orange, almost amber color. Forms a light fluffy head, and the lacing remains on the glass.
Smell - Citrus and pine.
Taste - The citrus hits hard up front, but there is a strong malt background that really rounds off the flavors nicely. Pine and hops on the back end as you swallow with just the right amount of bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Bready, medium-bodied, perfect carbonation, and smooth.
Overall - My favorite pale ale to date! I really enjoy the citra hop, and 3 Floyd's really did a good job incorporating it into their recipe. If you haven't had it, please do so. I gave it a 5/5 for a reason! 681 charactersSad_Larry, May 06, 2015

Pours a hazy dark orange-golden color. 1 finger white thick head that is sticking around for about the last 1/4 finger, and leaving nice lacing on the glass. Great big fresh tropical and citrus nose with a touch of pine and just enough malty character to let you know it's there. Taste comes through with delicate, yet tenacious pine, citrus, and tropical notes. Perfect, perfect, perfect body and mouth feel for an APA, finishes with a nice dryness, although I'm just looking for a bit more hop flavor on the back end. I mean, it's easy drinking, beautifully balanced, and nice and refreshing, so that's awesome, but I'm really looking for something to "pop" or send me over the edge. Doesn't stand up to others like PseudoSue in my opinion. Still, let's be honest. Pretty damn good. 827 charactersajchocholousek, May 05, 2015

Obviously there are times where I just like to sit back and enjoy a beer instead of always reviewing and as it is, two and a half months on, I’m down to my last bottle and so here’s the review. This 12oz bottle was bottled on 13 February 2015 and poured into a pint glass.
A: The beer poured a slightly hazy golden orange colour with a nice one and a half finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving nice stringy lacing.
S: Intense aromas of tropical fruits especially pineapple and mango hit first, followed by some citrus grapefruit and a hint of bready malts finally ending with some hoppy pine.
T: Much like the smell, there was tropical pineapple, citrus grapefruit, some bready buscuity malts and a very nice bitter finish.
M: Very crisp, light and with medium carbonation.
O: I had high expectations before trying it and it lived up to those expectations. It was a very easy APA to drink and this is a must buy if available for me. It was best when it was freshest.

A - Cloudy, tangerine color.  Looks a lot like a WC style IPA.  Fluffy off white head, great carbonation
S - Citra hops explode from the glass.  Grapefruit, orange, lemon peel.  A little bit of a floral note comes through underneath.  Very juicy smelling.
T - Wow.  An amazing Pale Ale.  Citra hops like whoa.  Juicy orange, tangerine.  A nice hop bitterness throughout.  Bready sweetness underneath balances it out perfectly.  
O - Still the best Pale Ale out there for my money.  I wish this was available in CA! 587 charactersjow_42, May 01, 2015

Pours a clear, bright orange body. Head is 3/4 of an inch and pearly white. Lacing was good and head retention was outstanding.
Smell is of floral hops, rye malt, and spice like cardamon or coriander. Fresh cut grass comes through as the beer warms. Not much alcohol is detected.
Taste is of earthy and floral hops. Getting some lemongrass, pine, rye, and maybe ginger or something a tad spicy. Malt is pretty light and alcohol is barely detected.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied for an IPA, well carbonated. Nice head added to the body.
Overall good beer but I was expecting more because of the hype. I gravitate more towards the fruit forward pale ales, maybe thats why I didn't rate it higher. Solid beer though 747 charactersangelmonster, Apr 29, 2015

A: Very nice looking orange amber with nice white fluffy head, lots of lacing, nice stream of carbonation coming off the bottom, head never vanished.
A: Amazing aroma, big citrusy piney, smells like an IPA. 
T: Lots of bitterness up front, fades into a piney, citrusy, bread like flavor, malts on the backend, leaves a really dry evaporated taste, bitterness lingers, surprisingly the alcohol is barely noticeable, very nice. 
M: Medium mouthfeel, finishes really dry. 
O: Very impressed, the aroma is world class, even thought it's an APA, the aroma reminds me of Pliny the Elder, it's big, citrusy, piney, very nice, the flavor is almost IPA, but the mouthfeel reminds that this is an APA. Definitely a world class beer. 778 charactersBrolo75, Apr 23, 2015

Smell - This has a great smell for a low IBU / ABV pale ale. Bready and dank. 
Taste - A great taste for what it is. Bread hits first and dank hops mellow out to the finish.
Feel - There is no sting on the tongue. It feels like soft water. 
Overall - Why drink an imperial or double when you can get the taste from this pale ale? I really can't believe I only bought a 6 pack of this at the brewery. 472 charactersmadelfonatree, Apr 21, 2015

Found a little honeypot liquor store which has this on the regular.
Although its $17/6-pack, its still worth every penny.
This is something I compare other beers to consistently.
I know that 3 floyds is building another facility next door to the current bar/pub as I was just there last month.
If they could step up production instead of adding 20 other IPA's to their line up, I would drink this beer till I die(no pun) 473 charactersThomasPeck, Apr 19, 2015

A: slightly orange in hue. a decent amount of haze, but nothing too crazy. good looking brew.
S: aroma is full of pineapple hop juiciness. hop resins throughout. gram cracker grain notes in the aroma.
T: flavor is similar. tropical mostly, perhaps a little bit of pine hop flavor.  a minor crystal malty flavor is fleeting at best. bitterness is moderate, a tad on the strong side in my opinion. tone that back a touch and this is even more lights out. maybe I got used to it, but I found this more and more drinkable throughout and the bitterness continued to fad. 
M: average carb for a pale. medium bodied brew. 
D: got the month plus old bottle from a co-worker. very appreciated to get to try this again since a trip to Chicago. hoping for an increased distribution of all things 3 Floyds. 844 charactersJimmys, Apr 17, 2015

L: Faily clear hay/amber color
S: Dank and hoppy. Has a tinge of citrus that I thought used to be more pronounced
T: nice hopy, citrusy front and finish.  Almost has a metalic taste to it.  
F: medium/light mouthfeel
O: Fantasitic beer.  One of my go too's for FFF.  Doesn't seem as good as I remembered.  Wonder if it is the Citra hop batch that everyone has been complaining about.  But the look isn't as hazy, the smell isn't as pungent and the overall taste seems to be a tad lacking.  Still a world class beer. 533 characterstapperm, Apr 14, 2015

A: Hazy mellow gold with nice retention of foamy lacing on the glass. Very interesting a pretty for a pale ale.
S: Very interesting blend of the hop character with the base malts. Good amount of lemon hop sweetness and some other citrus notes. 
T: Very interesting indeed. Opens up with a good non-assertive hop blend finishing out with strong honey notes. A bit of grapefruit and other citrus tones. It is a beer that I am savoring and really can't see myself just kicking this back.
M: Follows through excellently with the taste. The bitterness from the hop character is subdued and you the malts are constrained well as to not give off that somewhat lager-ish overly malty and sometimes copper taste that you can get from pale ales.
O: A great take on a pale ale and I would seek this out again. I can't put this ahead of Hoppy Birthday just because of my love for IPAs but this is definitely in the top 3 pale ales I've ever had. 1,117 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, Apr 08, 2015

This just explodes with hop flavor and finishes with honey and I want to say toffee/caramel. Not as piney as some of the west coast ipa's I am use to, but I like this flavor profile much more. Only complaint here is the nose, which is definitely lacking although something I can live without. 397 charactersblockdude, Apr 07, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 512 oz. bottle poured into a snifter
Pours a hazy, deep straw gold with two fingers of fluffy white head that maintains a thin cap and soft fuzzy lacing on the side of my glass. Aroma is a captivating blend of bright citrus that takes my nose hostage the instant I pop the cap. Lots of lemon zest, grapefruit, and lime with just a touch of sweet biscuity malt. I'm tempted to splash some on my neck as cologne. That's as sexy as any pale ale can smell.
Tastes every bit as good as my nose told me it would. More sharp, bright citrus that manages to both bite the palate and gently caress it at the same time. Impressive multitasking. There's faint tropical fruit and floral notes, but lemon, orange, and grapefruit rule the day. Also a hint of pine resin for good measure. Just as in the aroma, the light grainy malt offers just enough body to give a fleeting illusion of sweetness. Body is a bit lighter than medium, with lively carbonation. Crisp and refreshing, with a slightly dry finish and lingering memories of all the hop goodness within.
I was worried my anticipation would lead to a classic case of unmet expectations. Nope. I waited until the last bottle of my 6-pack to review it, as I didn't want to let my initial euphoria influence my rating unjustly. Pale ale, IPA, call it whatever you want. This beer is a work of art in every way. I wanted to find a reason not to rate it a 5, but I'd be lying to myself. 1,425 charactersglass_house, Apr 07, 2015

Look = 4.5 Pours a cloudy golden copper with a hint of orange.  Three fingers of crisp white head fades to a thin ring.  Lace is nuts; super dense small bubbles and incredibly sticky.
Smell = 4.5  Citra hops all around.  Citrus and tropical fruits, earthy, grass and pine.  Super strong.  Even better as it warms up.  A hint of sweetness.
Taste = 4.5  Citrus, grassy, grainy hops dominate.  A hint of sweetness with a bitter finish.  No hint of alcohol.  Hop dominated but a little balance fits the APA style perfectly.
Feel = 4.0  Medium body, medium-to-high carbonation.  Fits the crispness of the flavor well.
Drinkability = 5.0  Not sure if I’ve ever had a more drinkable beer.  6.4% but smooth as can be.  Hops dominated but fantastically refreshing.  If it wasn’t so hard to get I’d drink 4 at a time.  Flexible too; refreshing during the summer but complex for a cold winter’s night.
Overall = 4.475  Very well rounded APA; hop focused but complex and even a little balanced at the same time.  Pretty, great smell, great taste, refreshing, everything you could ask for. 1,158 characterskbwalters, Apr 04, 2015

One of the few breweries that you know is worth the money every time.  Very, very good flavor, smell, and look, with the unbeatable Floyds' mouthfeel that is the perfect combo of hop oiliness and carbonation.  Had this most recently at a medium-sized bar with a really well put together forty-beer strong tap list and three kegs of this as part of a "tap takeover" night.  It was gone in 45 minutes.  That should pretty much explain the following this beer has. 534 charactersmilwaukee512, Mar 29, 2015
3.97/5  rDev -12.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A nice intersection between a good label, name, and beer. It does have a really lipsmacking fruit flavor, but there is no malt and the flavor drops off almost immediately. The hazy burnt orange is indeed great looking and the beer sports a wonderful egg-shell white head that sticks around for the entirety of the beers consumption. 
Don't let the hype tell you that this is one of the finest beers ever made, but also make no mistake that this is a good beer and maybe a great one. I think its telling that if I could just walk into a liquor store and pick this up on the regular I would, especially in the summer months. 623 charactersTCJ0100, Mar 29, 2015

It's not my favorite smell, but it's a definite branding of the beer, it makes it special and very unique. The initial taste is exactly like the smell, unique and natural.  It's bold and direct and demands my attention. I don't know that I trust it, but I believe it. It's not my usual taste for beer, but I damn well appreciate it. Much like my boss, it's not my favorite but it's a leader and knows what it's doing. 462 charactersDan_McNeely, Mar 22, 2015

A - Burnt (hazy) orange, tinge of amber.  Nice small head with good lacing. 
S - Wow, you can probably smell this across the wrong. Knocks your nose off with citrus, orange, pine smells. 
T - Great malt backbone with light, refreshing citra hop taste afterwards, crisp finish.
O - Really amazing. The aroma knocked me off my feet, wasn't expecting that. Very solid, looking forward to finishing the sixer. 437 charactersericdavidmorris, Mar 21, 2015

Look: Hazy orange with good head.
Smell: Awesome! Citrus bomb.
Taste: Better than it smells.
Feel: Just right amount of everything. Well balance of hops, malts, and carbonation.
Overall: A top 3 beer in my books. May even be a bargain compared to most 6-pack of this quality. 389 charactersKMachHops, Mar 19, 2015

A- slightly cloudy, orange haze, and off white head with very good lacing
S- Fantastic mix of orange peel, citrus, and pine    jump from the glass while a subtle malt sweetness is also apparent
T- Solid malt backbone with a crisp cracker taste dominating; Citra hops create a fruity bitter taste that is very prominent but not overpowering
M- Medium, light body with a crisp dry finish. Medium carbonation that leaves some hop taste on the palate for minutes after drinking.
O- Overall, a very good beer. Although I think it may not be so popular if it were readily available, it is still one of my favorite beers. It is hoppy enough for hopheads, yet balanced and smooth enough to be a session beer (but too damn rare).  I will definitely keep my eyes open for more. 876 charactersHoosierCountry, Mar 16, 2015

4.94/5  rDev +9.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Founder's pint glass. Surprisingly no bottle date on this 6-pack, but can't be more than a week or so old. 
A: Pours a hazy dark orange color, with a foamy 1-finger white head. 
S: Pineapple, orange juice, grapefruit. Classic citra here. Aroma is richer than your average IPA. 
T: Huge pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine. Slight biscuity notes at the finish, just enough to balance out the hop hop flavors. 
M: Pretty much where this beer separates itself. Flavor and aroma get you thinking IPA, but then the mouthfeel is simple like a pale ale. No booziness, great carbonation. Finish is very clean and refreshing, with minimal bitterness in the aftertaste. 
O: I think the reason I love this beer so much, and maybe why many others do, is because you have you grade it for style. And when it comes to pale ales, this beer is one of the best. It smells and tastes like any of the best citra IPAs out there, but drinks like a pale ale. Not quite a session beer, but definitely smooth and drinkable. How they can pack that much punch in the flavor is beyond me. 
Recommendation: One of those legendary beers that every craft beer fan needs to try at least once. In my opinion, it falls off after 6 weeks, so drink it fresh! 1,263 charactersSparty1224, Mar 08, 2015

Great beer, definitely get the whole pale ale vs ipa debate - this tastes like a hoppy, light pale ale to me. Doesn't have the weight or sharpness of an IPA. That being said, this is friggin awesome. In the top 20 on the 250 list is probably overrated, but this is a terrific beer. Similar to Knee Deep Citra Extra Pale Ale. 385 charactersJwburns75, Feb 28, 2015

The smell is of robust citrus - grapefruit and orange. Spicy, with some pale malt mixing in.
The taste is citric - grapefruit (some orange), balanced by a firm grainy malt backing. It has a bitter finish.
Smooth despite lingering bitterness. Juicy.
A hop-forward pale ale. Very well-done, to say the least. Great choice if you want a hoppy brew that is on the border of an APA and an IPA! 483 charactersjwc215, Feb 24, 2015

A: dark amber color slight haze
S: lots of herbal citrus maybe a little caramel 
T: very citrus nice mellow juicy flavor lots of herbal taste coming through surprising amount of malt 
M: mediumish feel coats the tongue a little
O: This beer is quite good but it's not crazy good like the hype implies. if you can find it definitely grab some but don't go nuts trying to find it. Beautiful Citra hops but there are better Citra beers. 489 charactersSomethingClever, Feb 06, 2015

More fruity, bitterness disappears more quickly. But for the price and lack of abundance... is it really worth it? That being said, super solid throughout. Likely sits in my top 5 for beers. I rate it higher than Sierra Nevada, sure. But I'm not sure that makes it *better*. 355 charactersExtol, Jan 25, 2015

s - distinctly citra, sweet malt
t - hops are dominated by sweeter malts, most prevelant in more recent batches. Used to be much more unbalanced, citra used to shine, feel as if its been balanced with more malt.

The aroma hits you with a burst of fresh cut grass and chopped fruits. The mouthfeel is satisfyingly medium bodied with a lively fizz and a depth of taste that awakens your tongue. There is a je ne sais quoi here - something that drives both hopheads and casual beer drinkers alike to go wild over this beer. I think it has something to do with the bold but not overpowering hopping and the incredible gush of tropical fruit that sets this apart. 533 charactersBarnoloid, Jan 11, 2015
4.78/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured into a Duvel snifter glass.
A - Poured a dark honey color, formed a finger of dense and creamy, slightly off-white head.
S - Amazing. Oranges, hops, grapefruit, apples, pineapple, mango, peach, persimmons. One of the most bright, vibrant and tropical aroma's I've ever smelled on a beer.
T - Very similar to the nose, but not as sweet, more like the savory side of these fruits. I would have preferred these tastes be just slightly sweeter, but the taste is amazing regardless.
O - This beer isn't just hype, it really is great. for me, the beer would be a perfect 100 had the taste matched the aroma's sweetness just a bit more, but as it stands it is still an A+ beer in my books. Definitely the best pale ale I've ever had and I highly recommend it.
V - The value is good because if you've got it in your hands, you probably had to work for it, thus you're probably willing to pay whatever price tag is on it. Seriously though, it is worth every penny. 963 charactersBeer-Revelry, Jan 11, 2015

Have only ever had this one from bottles so it was nice to try it on tap.  Great use of citra, the nose really pops, but the mouthful may be the best thing here -- from almost the start to almost the end, there is a constant (somehow) smooth yet biting bitterness that keeps you wondering when it is going to give out, and it keeps on going. 376 charactersTaybeh, Jan 09, 2015

A- Little bit of a darker orange hue for a typical APA or IPA, nice slight head. Unfiltered and beautiful
S- what a great smell! what extra pale ales or american pale ales usually lack in hop smell, this hits in spades
T- more hop flavor than a typical APA, this one is so good. Citrus, pine, and pure yumminess!

Light amber color, off-white head that hangs out for a good portion of the experience.
Smells floral, hoppy (hoppier than the taste actually is), fruits
Tastes like a 5. Like a Pale Ale done absolutely right.
Feels like a dream
Overall - excellent. 472 charactersrooskey379, Dec 31, 2014

4.56/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.512 oz bottled 12/1/2014. Poured into a Tired Hands taster glass
Appearance: Pours a light golden amber color with 3 fingers of an off white head with good retention and lacing. Body is mostly clear, but with some very fine suspended sediment and light visible carbonation.
Smell: Grapefruit, pine, mango jelly, slight malt character.
Taste: Same as the aroma. Pine, tropical fruit and citrus stand out. Lots of grapefruit in the finish and aftertaste. Almost the perfect amount of malt sweetness to balance the whole thing out. Medium bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Light medium bodied with a somewhat soft mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 
Overall: Really great beer. One of the best pale ales/IPAs out there. 708 charactersJonada, Dec 31, 2014

Anyway. Nice golden color (slightly darker than Heady if you care) good looking white foam. Nose is incredible with an explosion of piney fruityness. Just epic hops, juicy grapefruit and it will blow your mind. Maybe the best smelling beer in the world! Taste is equally good bitter but it feels perfectly integrated. This beer drinks great and even non IPA/hops lovers will appreciate it. 510 charactersKATCanada, Dec 30, 2014

I smelled it from the bottle before pouring. Huge grapefruit and mango. Yup, this is Citra alright. A little earthiness in there as well. Taste is like biting into some sort of grapefruit/mango hybrid fruit. A nice malt backbone too to round things out. I'm getting just a hint of pine and maybe a bit of onion. Drinks incredibly smoothly. Many say this blurs the line between APA and IPA and I'd have to agree. It has that bitter edge and hop aroma of an IPA, but enough balance with the malts that brings it closer to an APA. Mouthfeel is wonderful. Clean, crisp, refreshing, very light and easy to drink. Overall, this is definitely worthy of the praise. Just a great all around beer. Huge hop presence, easy to drink, and a great ode to Citra hops.  I want to compare it to the likes of Alpine's Hoppy Birthday, although that one uses more than just Citra. Really just a fantastic beer any way you look at it. 1,030 charactersMisSigsFan, Dec 29, 2014

S: Very tropical smell. Lots of fruits mango, citrus. Followed by a more floral hop and piney smell. Smell wasn't very strong however.
T: Amazing. incredibly well balanced and delicious. Very "juciy" lots of citrus and troipical fruits but its amazing how well its balanced and how easy it is to drink. There's a very slight grapefruit/ hop bitterness, but there also a semi sweet malt to it. All meshed with the fruits. And that great hop aftertaste. Its  Amazing. No alcohol presence at all. Only slight downside is I wish the flavors were a little stronger.
F: Spot On. Very refreshing perfect carbonation. And perfect balance just like the taste. Not sticky or dry.
O: Little different from my normal Ipas. But an amazing beer. One of my top 3 easily. Super easy to drink and so juicy. 894 charactersGinjaSlice, Dec 25, 2014

Great bright Citra hop nose, fruity, tropical, a touch sweet from the malt. Palate is delicious, similar to the palate, and the malt profile is excellent, not excessively thin as some of these attempts at showcasing tropical hops can be. Overall, I think this one lives up to the hype. 421 charactersbreadwinner, Dec 16, 2014

Look: Orange, golden color with a head that stayed the entire time.
Smell: Apricot and citrus. Lord love the citra hop
Taste: what work by the brewer balancing such a strong smelling and tasting hop with the a slight bread taste from the malt. You get what you smell and never once feel overpowered with the citra hop.
This beer is probably top 3 for me. Wow, is all I can come up with. I love when hype is met in this community. Hope I can find it again soon. 487 charactersJC333, Dec 07, 2014

4.99/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass, beer is less than 4 weeks old.
Appearance: Pours honey orange with some haze to it. Head is bright white and lasts for only a minute or two. Leaves soap sud lace in sheets with big bubbles clinging to the glass. Must be bottle conditioned as I got some unexpected sediment in the poor but overall a good looking beer.
Aroma: Heavy on tropical aroma of pineapple and mango with hints of candied grapefruit and sweet orange peel. Very fruity bouquet of aromas that doesn't carry much malt or pine aromas. Smells like a hoppy fruit bomb. For a pale this aroma is intense.
Taste: Juicy fruit is really the best descriptor here, the mango and pineapple medley continues onto the pallet , have never had a beer with such focused hop character with such a balance of bitterness and malt character. The hops are by far the star of the show but in the most complex yet drinkable manner possible. Much bigger on mango and pineapple and still hints of citrus but a great strong fruit flavor. A small amount of biscuit and caramel pokes through but overall this has to be the closest thing to drinking hop aroma as possible. Excellent. World Class.
Mouthfeel: Carbonation and body are perfect and refined. No bitter aftertaste or heavy dryness or acidity. Excellent across the board.
Overall: With the exception of the small amount of haze to the beer it is in fact world class. Squeezing the amount of flavor and aroma into a beer that resembles fruit so much takes a lot of skill. Especially if this is really 100% citra which can get tricky in bittering. It deserves its spot as the king of pale ales for now at least. 1,657 charactersFieldzy27, Dec 05, 2014

Can you give a Pale Ale a 5 or 100 or whatever the scoring is? Possibly, but I want to reserve that until I try Heady Topper and Pliny. Just in case they truly are better beers. I would say at this point this is the best Pale Ale/IPA I have ever had. 
Appearance: Straw yellow, hazy but with some redness going on. Its a very attractive beer.
Smell: Tropical fruits, mango, peach, some citrus aromas in there, maybe a hint of pineapple as well. 
Taste: This is where they get ya. It is the most balanced IPA/Pale Ale I have ever had. Its very drinkable. So, drinkable in fact, that you could get into bad trouble with this one. It has the right amount of hop/malt ratio. You do get some bitterness, but not a palate wrecking hop 
blast. Mango's, papaya, pineapple, lots of fruitiness in this beer, but there is a sharpness going on as well, that makes it explode in your mouth. This is a very nicely made beer. 
Overall: Its well worth the hype, and I do appreciate this trade. I am fortunate to have 2 six packs of this and I plan on sharing these with some good friends, but thanks to Pluchar for this one! Cheers brother! 1,217 charactershumuloner22, Dec 02, 2014

5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tried not to be biased in my review, but this beer is just that damn good.  It fulfilled my expectations and then some.  Here goes:
A:  As I've said in other review, FFF has got the appearances of its beers down to a T.  Beautiful, clear orange with a ton of carbonation bursting forth from the bottom of the glass.  This beer also has a massive, three-fingered head that leaves a ton of lacing.
S:  Beautiful - but not overbearing - collection of tropical fruit owing to the citra hops.  Mango, pineapple, grass, lemon and grapefruit - they're all here.  Also lots of caramel malt.
T:  To die for.  Caramel malt gives way to the hops - perfectly balanced, like an APA should be.  Hop tastes follow the nose - just splendid.
M:  Plenty of carbonation, medium-bodied as well.  Outstanding.
O:  Deserves its place at the top of the APA list. 844 charactersleantom, Nov 28, 2014

There are definitely pales with limited distribution more worthy of the kind of hype this beer gets.  Not to take away from the quality of this pale ale, it's great.  Just not that great...In my opinion. 288 charactersphishterrrrrrr88, Nov 21, 2014

Having said that, this beer has a nose on it that will blow you away.  Citra hops smell and taste amazing in this brew and will leave you wanting more.  Easy to drink, not always easy to find, maybe that's why it tastes so good when you do... 408 charactersIratolla, Nov 15, 2014

A: 3/3 - golden-orange coloration, high clarity (can both read and see through), initial frothy white carbonation settled into a subtle glass lacing with carbonation lakes and mixed sized bubbles; moderate alcohol legs
S: 10/12 - moderate citrus and tropical fruit aroma - tangerine, orange, mango, papaya - with a subtle crystal malt sweetness and some alcohol
T: 18/20 - on the front of the tongue, there is a gentle hop bitterness; this quickly gives way to citrus flavors - most prominently, candied orange - but some tropical flavors as well - mango, pineapple and papaya; on the back of the palate, there is a touch of bready/biscuity and caramel malts; finishes dry and inviting of subsequent sips
M: 4/5 - medium body, juicy but not hop coating, moderate carbonation
O: 9/10 - although not as wowed as on my first experience when I had no expectations, it's a world class pale ale; love that candied sugar sweetness in the middle of the palate that is not cloying; after having PseudoSue on the same trip, I would give them the slight edge but feel like they are more different than you'd expect; obviously recommended, especially for $5/pint

3.5/5  rDev -22.7%This beer represents 3 floyds very well, with that citrus undertone, wonderful frothy head, and that perfect orange, lemon zest floral aroma. It's a great beer and after finally acquiring one through I close friend, am please that it's my first review.
In comparison to other pale ales, wonderfully smooth, balanced, citrusy, crisp, but ever so slightly more malty in comparison to other 3 folyds. But to be truthful, doesn't taste much different than gumballhead, which I had just 1 night before. After trying this, I had to crack open a gumball just to do a side by aide comparison because the two tasted so similar from memory. 
Side by side, the two different characteristics of each 3 floyds take on each style (wheat & pale ale) are highly evident. The signature floyds citrus is just an underscore and you can pick up both the crisp breadiness of the wheat ale Gumballhead and the cleanly balanced bitterness of the legendary Zombie Dust.
That being said, overall, I'm a little let down. This beer, even in Indiana, is extremely rare to get ahold of. When in stock, its by the 1 or 2 six packs that fly off the shelf. Every craft lover I talk too speaks of zombie dust like it's the loch ness monster of beer; a legend that's rarely been seen. I was expecting something epic, rememberable, and the fact that I had to taste this and gumballhead side by side to tell the difference days something. Gumballs are hard enough to get ahold of where I'm from, let alone this beer, that is with out a doubt, more hype than delivery. It's a great beer, but not the holy Bigfoot x files Grail that, at least in these parts, it's played up to be. Still an easy 7/10 overall. 1,673 charactersUriaHeep, Nov 07, 2014
5/5  rDev +10.4%This shows me that the Alstrom Bros are not dialed in.  A 90?  C'mon man....this is arguably the greatest beer ever made.  That is like saying the Godfather is just OK, or that the Brady Bunch Movie has more laughs than Caddyshack.  They rated Smuttynose Finest Kind a 100 and this a 90.  That is pure comedy!  They think Dogfish 60 and Stone are better than this?  OMG....absolute comedy.  This is a great great beer.   Trust me on this.   I absolutely love this beer, and I am not alone because this is harder to come by than Pappy Van Winkle 20.   
The beautiful pour,  the heavenly aroma, and the explosion of flavor of the first sip.  The hop profile is complex, deep and compelling.   Pine & Citrus, with floral jungle flower undertones....rich color...great initial blast of resiny flavor with a beautiful finish.  This is as close to heaven as a brew could get.  Absolute perfection and I just wish everyone could try it. 930 charactersSmr7626, Nov 07, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +4.9%Poured from a bottle into my Duvel tulip glass.  I am lucky enough to try this because of the tremendous generosity of @creepinjeeper.  I've been dying to try this beer forever and finally it has happened!
A:  A medium amber orange color with a beautiful white one finger head.  Full glass lacing.
S:  Wow, WOW!  This beer has a huge reputation and I always wondered if it is justified.  That's an emphatic hell yeah!  I can tell just from the nose, this is one incredible beer.  The nose is all citrus and fruit with grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach and slight pine mixed with some slight bready sweet malt.  The smell is just out of this world.  I just keep sniffing it.  Holy Citra hops!
T:  No letdown here with the taste.  The hops just dance on your tongue in a magical way, this is a hoppy beer.  Flavors of huge citrus follow the nose with grapefruit, lemon, tangerine, peach and pineapple.  There is some bready biscuit malt that holds the beer together, but this one is all about the hops.  Finish stays with the fruit flavors and mixes in some slight pine that leads to slight bitterness but remains dry.  Terrific beer.
M:  Medium mouthfeel that is not overly bitter but still dry and no alcohol is tasted.  Perfect carbonation, perfect mouthfeel.
O:  This beer absolutely lives up to the hype.  This is the best pale ale I have ever had, hands down and one of the best beers I have ever had.  Tremendous!  I just wish I had constant access to it.  I have one more bottle to enjoy, then alas it will be gone.....and I shall cry.
Great, great beer. 1,568 charactersKadonny, Nov 03, 2014

Aroma is full of pine resin and citrus, very pleasant !!. Taste is not what I was expecting. Hits hard at first with hops but at the same time a nice malt sweetness that balances it all out well. Intensely hopped(I like it) yet balance is nice. I wanted to try it and now I have. I think what sets this beer apart from the others is the ability to overhop this brew and yet still have a great balance and drinkabilty that other beers wish they had !! 521 charactershophugger, Oct 29, 2014

A. Pours a hazy amber/copper color with a beautiful foamy 1 1/4" head.
S. A slight bread smell overshadowed by a fruit bucket of well picked hops. Makes you want to drink it. 
T. What a great balance of flavors.  Some biscuity maltyness with a great amount of fruity citrusy hop flavor and a little bit of white grape. Perfect amount of bitterness compliments this excellently balanced but also complex flavor.  Aftertaste is like cotton candy. 
M. Medium bodied with some prickly mouth carbonation that slightly follows down the throat. Just what I want out of an IPA/APA. 
O. This beer is hard to beat.  It's the total package. Not a weak spot here.  Highly recommended and will always try to have in my fridge. 752 charactersIPAGeorge, Oct 28, 2014

Pours a clear gold color with lots of tiny bubbles and an enormous white head.  Good lacing and retention.
Smells like heaven!  This is the stuff dreams are made of...  At least mine.  Loads of lemony citrus with some tangerine and grapefruit.
The flavor is just as I had hoped.  Lots of citrus and tropical fruit up front with just a hint of sweetness from the malt before the hops take over again for the finish.
Medium body with a dry finish and a nice lingering bitterness.
Overall, an outstanding beer. I don't know if it's an APA or and IPA, but I don't really care.  What it is is an amazingly well crafted beer with about as perfect of balance as I can imagine.  I would happily drink this again (and again and again). 788 charactersmr-jj, Oct 28, 2014

5/5  rDev +10.4%Not sipping right now so I will reserve my review for later but from what I remember from last Thursday, this was like a Heady Topper with less alcohol bit to it and a wonderful blend of Citrus (lots of citrus for you hop heads like me), bitterness (relatively low at 60), and bite at only 6.4%. It's a Heady that you can have more than 2 of in one sitting. My own personal order would put this beer at #2 after Pliney The Elder (only because of how perfectly balanced that beer is). This beer isn't balanced much it's a smack of Citrusy Hops across the face. My #3 would be Sofie, with Maine Lunch and Heady rounding out my personal top 5. 640 charactersPhishbum, Oct 26, 2014

4.85/5  rDev +7.1%12-oz bottle poured into a Spieglau IPA glass.
Looks very attractive in the glass. Fluffy, foamy head with pretty evenly sized bubbles. Gold in color, nice and mostly clear. Lacing is fair to good.
Nosing, I get hit by hops and soursop (the fruit) more than anything else. The soursop I smell is what most would call the grapefruit/citrus rind. Ends in deep hop aroma, showcasing citra's amazing aromatic and bittering qualities.
Taste just blows me away. Floral hoppiness, bitter, malt balance, and fruit all in that order. Tasting as I exhale reveals the fruits a little more,  sweetened slightly by the malt.
Medium bodied to carry these crazy flavors and aromas to the mouth, but not hammer you. Extremely refreshing and drinkable. My mouth misses the feeling of this beer in it after every sip.
Overall, I need to stop writing and start posting ISO of some more. This is definitely going to be the first beer I clone once homebrewing commences. Absolutely a stellar beer, and I could not be more impressed. 1,016 charactersOne1Asterisk, Oct 25, 2014

With that said, this beer still stood out. The beer in itself is very well balanced. There was enough of a malt backbone to support the bitterness, so it never became a palate destroyer, which I like. The hop aroma/flavor is why this beer stood out. Loads of juicy nuances that keeps inviting you back to take another drink, just so you can stick your nose back into the glass. This is a great example of a very hop forward, well balanced APA/IPA, call it what you will. Worth seeking out to try. 615 charactersfrothy_80, Oct 25, 2014

This beer leaves a decent amount of lacing as well.  Aroma is a rich blend of orange and other citrus along with very subtle pine notes without being cloying or overpowering. Taste is outstanding with a continuance of orangey citrus notes and pine plus with a barely detectable presence in the background that brings to mind children's aspirin believe it or not. Mouthfeel is full and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall this is an outstanding beer. Though I have some philosophical objections to to the arch-hipsterishness of Three Floyds in general, this might be the premier example of what an American pale ale should be. 741 charactersbristol2120, Oct 19, 2014

5/5  rDev +10.4%I just started drinking beer recently and while trying many different kinds so far, this is by far the best. I'm lucky enough to have the Three Floyds Brewery only about 20 miles from me or so, and I couldn't be any happier about it. Zombie Dust is the pinnacle of what  an American Pale Ale should be. 302 charactersEthereal429, Oct 18, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +4.9%Look: Crystal clear golden amber with a nice white head. Lots of legs keep the head up and some lacing. 
Smell: Citra hops come bursting out of the bottle with hints of lemon, line, kiwi, mango, pineapple, and a slight earthy hop finish. The malt makes a slight appearance in the background with a nice bready malt but the hops are definitely the show stealer here! 
Taste: Wow! For how hoppy the nose was it is amazingly balanced on the tongue! Getting lemon, lime, mango, slight peach, definitely piney, the sweet malt starts to take over but before it does some sweet orange and a dash more pine hit the tongue before the sweet malt takes over in what can only be described as a perfect balance. There is some lingering pine and mango notes of the finish that buzz on the tongue long after each sip. 
Mouthfeel: Dank is the best way to describe this beer. It's wet and quenching at first but the hops quickly suck up the moisture after you've gotten just enough to leave the pine and citrus fruits dancing on your palate begging you to taste another sip
. Outstanding. Overall: Wow! Just one outstanding brew! This is one of those rare ones that lives up to and surpasses the hype. It's dank and hoppy yet sweet and balanced while drying out to allow you time to reflect on just how well the brew is crafted. I could drink this like water if I wasn't careful! I wasn't impressed with everything I've had from three Floyd's so far but this one killed it! The king of APA in my opinion. 1,491 charactersBergBeer, Oct 15, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +5.3%Enjoyed this beer on tap at Hopleaf in Chicago.  Poured into a Hopleaf pint glass, the brew is a lovely, clear copper with about a pinkie finger of head that seems long-lasting. Leaves lacing down the glass.
The aroma is big grapefruit, tropical  fruits, some lemon and a tease of malty sweetness in the back.
This beer tastes great. Lots of citrus and tropical fruit notes, a hint of grassiness and lemongrass perhaps. Some pine notes come out to play and there is a pleasant and lingering bitterness as well. As it warmed a bit, perhaps a little cracker on the tongue as well. But the hops dominate with their tropical fruit salad of fun.
Very nice, medium body and smooth on the palate.
Overall, great to finally have this beer. It lived up to the hype. So tasty and so drinkable. Great stuff! 796 charactersSD-Alefan, Oct 14, 2014

The smell is clean, fresh and floral/fruit (peach, mango, orange) with minimal bitterness.  Unlike the smell, the taste is somewhat bitter and the floral notes are more subdued than in the aroma.  The taste was good but felt a little one note.  Feel was thick and velvety for an APA.
Suggested food pairing: Burger
If you like this beer then you should also try: PseudoSue
Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely have it again) Both being elite APAs, I wanted to benchmark this against PseduoSue.  To me, PseduoSue was better...like MUCH better.  Not even close.  With all the hype surrounding this Zombie Dust, I was pretty excited to try it.  It's a good beer, but only just a "good" one.  I didn't find anything particularly special or interesting about it.  If it's available then, yes, give it a shot.  But I wouldn't make a priority out of finding it or exert any extra effort to get a hold of one. 1,032 charactersSHDoyle, Oct 12, 2014

A- Golden, honey-like. A tiny bit of haze. White head holds at one finger, and leaves behind some nice sticky lacing.
S- Pineapple, grapefruit peel, orange, peach, juicy all around. Sweet biscuity malt.
T- Bready background, sweet again. Juicy citrus and pineapple. A little dry citrus peel as well.

Appearance - Pours an amber gold,medium head, not too cloudy, not really clear either
Smell - Dank, citrusy hop explosion upon opening the bottle followed by a hint of malts 
Taste - Like the smell the dank citrusy hops smack you first balanced  by some maltyness and a nice crisp finish.  Just the right amount of bitterness.
Feel - Crisply carbonated goodness
Overall - Great beer, well balanced.  The citrus stands out and blends with the malts nicely.  Just the right amount of bitterness at the end to keep you wanting more. 558 charactersbigern1121, Oct 08, 2014

A- Light copper, high degree of clarity, one finger of white head. 
S- Lots of papaya, mango, and pineapple, and citrus. Not much else really just a huge hop presence. 
T- Light sweetness, fruity flavors of tropical fruits, some light bitterness on the end with some light toasted malt. 
M- Medium, really easy drinking. Not watery at all. 
O- This is an amazing beer that really straddles that APA/IPA line. This is the best showcase of Citra hops that I have encountered. Thirsty Dog's Citra Dog and Odd Side's CPA try to imitate but don't even come close. Really tried to go in not expecting to be blown away and I would suggest everyone try to do that. It's not a DIPA but just a very aromatic and full hop flavored pale ale that you could drink all day and not get sick of. Definitely worth a drive for your 2 case limit. 873 charactersPaulyB83, Sep 27, 2014

After smelling the hops and then taking a drink you are pleasently surprised how non-bitter it is given the amount of smell they emit.  It is very well done and a true suprise of the top 10 in an American Pale Ale. 285 charactersIsumurphy, Sep 24, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -6.2%A:  Pours a nice anger/ orange color with some haze.  Forms a full white head that slowly dies.  Lots and lots of lacing in this beer. 
S:  You can smell this beer from a foot away and it smells great.  Floral hops, citrus, lemon zest.  In the background is some pine, grass and malt.   The floral hop aroma is really outstanding.
T:  The citrus/ floral hop flavors hit first with a dry bitterness to the finish.  Some pine and hay flavors present even stronger than in the smell.  This beer is a study of balance and contrast.  
I enjoyed this beer more once it warmed up and the flavors became more pronounced.  I usually drink pale ales cold, but this one is good enough to enjoy at cellar temperature.
M:  Nicely carbonated as benefits the style.  Fuller bodied than most pale ales, the very dry finish leaves you wanting more.  
O:  This is a quality beer.  The hype may have exceeded what you get in this beer, but you will not regret giving it a try.  Not overly complex, but very flavorful for the style and very nicely balanced.  An enjoyable drinking experience. 1,076 charactersimscotty, Sep 24, 2014

4/5  rDev -11.7%A: Cloudy chestnut colour. Thick white crown. Plenty of lacing that sticks to the side of the glass. Rather discreet "bubbliness".
S: Big loads of hop aromas. Tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit etc. At the back some malty sweetness.
T: Heavy on the hops. Piny bitterness. Tropical fruit here aswell with a distinct bitterness at the end. Malty sweetness.
Mf: Medium body. On the heavier side of carbonation. Dry feel on the tounge due to the hops.
 O: A very good version of an american pale ale. Typically modern american ale with a heavy dose of hops. Nothing spectacular I would say but indeed a great beer. Gets plus for balance. 635 charactersLinusBohman, Sep 20, 2014

4.2/5  rDev -7.3%A: Pours a nice golden orange with a white head.  Head retention was good in my Dogfish IPA glass. 
S: Some dankness, a little citrus, and some resiny hops, with caramel malt, like a digestive biscuit.
T: Really well balanced between hops and malt. This is a super hoppy APA (an IPA really, look at the abv) but it has a solid malt profile to match the hops.  Some lingering bitterness, and not what I would describe as "juicy", more herbal in flavor.
M: carbonation was solid, medium body, maybe heavy for the style.
O: really nice, balanced well made APA.  If available, I could see this as a regular beer I'd drink often as it goes down easily.  Doesn't stand out to me among other good APAs/IPAs however. 708 charactersHuskyHawk, Sep 18, 2014

12 oz bottle, weizen glass
A – Pours orange to light amber. Thick finger of head that sticks around for a long time. Mild haze, probably from being poured cold, mostly good clarity otherwise.
S – Lots of lemon and other citrus, a bit of fresh cut grass, grapefruit.  A hop bomb. Some malty sweetness on the nose but balanced hard towards the hops. Some malt thickness. 
T – Very malty and then the hops take over. Citrus and grapefruit melts into a perfectly bitter finish. A ton of hop bitterness but really well balanced with the malt.
M – Very malty, relatively full body, just a bit of acidity leading into the finish. Bitterness coats the tongue, balanced with malt sweetness.  Not a palate wrecker despite smelling like it could be one. 
O – Having had this before without evaluating properly, I was pleasantly surprised to remember how well balanced it is.  There is a ton of hop flavor, aroma, and bitterness, but does not destroy your taste buds.  The malt has a great presence as well and really works together with the hops to create a remarkable beer. Great example of the American Pale Ale style. 1,143 charactersinfinitebruner, Sep 10, 2014

A- Nice light hay color with a touch of amber.  Decent carbonation, small half finger head and medium lacing.
S-  Lots of fruitiness up front.  Grapefruit, mango, pear and other citrus smells with just a little floral notes.
T- Fresh citrus and floral notes.  Just a little malt and pine in the aftertaste.  Nice mix of hops and very smooth and drinkable.  As the beer warmed up there were light notes of vanilla in the finish.
M- Light and smooth body.  As mentioned, this is a crisp and refreshing IPA and that is very noticeable on the palate.
O-  Definitely gives other top IPAs a run for their money.  One of the better ones I've encountered and I will be trading more NE brews for these guys again in the future.  Three Floyds is truly a brewery to be reckoned with and hit the nail on the head with this one. 855 charactersEveningCordial, Sep 07, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +4.9%I've had this twice now. Once a six-pack from the local Binny's, and tonight with a fresh case (bottled yesterday!) direct from 3F. The first time around I wanted to make the most of my bottles and drank one at a time among other beers. I was a bit underwhelmed. There is a very clear single-hop character and the flavor is big without being overpowering, but it just didn't seem as special as I was hoping for.
This most recent batch, though, illustrates that a fresh pale ale is the best pale ale. I think this is a very good example of a Citra-based single-hop beer.
The malt is barely noticeable, providing a sort of background flavor that lets the hops show through. Medium-body with a pale-amber color. Carbonation bulks up the medium body to provide a moderate mouthfeel. Certainly heavier than a mass-market beer but not enough to really weigh it down. I can drink quite a few pints without slowing down.
I made some shrimp scampi tonight and I must say this works pretty well as a pairing. The carbonation is big, the hops are very evident, and the medium body manages to complement the buttery richness of my food without being too light or heavy. I don't think this would work very well with strongly-spiced cuisine or heartier red meat, but with seafood and/or brighter flavors it works very well. It would work well with a loaded hamburger, but not so much with a hot dog or a steak–if you get what I mean.
As I implied earlier though - fresher is better. After it's a few weeks old it's not *bad* but it's certainly not as good either. 1,555 charactersdethbunny, Aug 21, 2014

4.6/5  rDev +1.5%Golden amber color with a white head that settles to a steady cap and laces the glass all the way down.  Big citrus and tropical notes combine with a bready, caramel like malt presence.  Taste is of citrus fruits, grapefruit, orange and tangerine.  Tropical flavors of mango, pineapple and guava.  Underneath the blast of fruit flavors that ride the whole way through the palate is a great sweet bread malt presence.  Medium body, crisp mouthfeel and semi dry finish.  Overall a great APA.  Is it worth the hype?  It's a great APA which showcase the citra hop extremely well.  It's a top APA for sure so the hype is at least partially warranted. 647 charactersHopBomb515, Aug 18, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +4.9%A: Copper with a light haze, 2 fingers of creamy beige head. Almost no visible carbonation.  Some fine pencil sketch lacing.
S: Amazing.  Grapefruit, jackfruit, a background of onions and garlic, a solid dankness.  Passion fruit, caramel, orange and orange peel.  Strong and in your face goodness upon opening.
T: Orange citrus, lemon candy, grapefruit pith, jackfruit, onions and garlic, passionfruit.  Good malt back bone, and good fresh Citra hops.  A solid bitterness on the end.  The oily resins from the hops coat your mouth and tongue, leaving them sticky like the tongue of a hummingbird in spring.
M:  Medium body, sticky hop coating on the tongue and teeth.  Medium low fine bubbled carbonation.
O: Excellent, 9.8 out of 10.  This is my 4th bottle, the first I had was the day I picked up a 6-er at the brew pub in Munster, IN.  Drank today, Oct 15th in Chiang Mai, Thailand during a beer Skype with my brother.  I left him a bottle in Canada. 961 characterspatre_tim, Aug 15, 2014

A: cloudy, hazed orange; about a finger of bubbly, cream head forms on the pour and leaves some impressive rings of thick, sugary lace; impressive look for a pale ale.
S: citrus hops; orange / apricot pith; tangerine; a tad peppery; some light bready notes are there in the background.
T: such a smooth blend of flavor... a mix of citrus and tropical fruit hop flavor; just a touch of bread crust malt; just a bit chalky, too; seems like some sort of nuanced Belgian twist is in there, too; pretty complex for the style; very tasty.
M: medium body; high carbonation; pretty lively and refreshing.
O: one of the best pale ales around; nice and hoppy, but also with some other light (and unique) components in the aroma and taste; on top of that, it's very drinkable! 819 charactersjpro, Aug 13, 2014

5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From the first time you smell the hops in the glass, you know this is a special beer. Yes there is an explosion of hops, although controlled, when you taste it, but the clean mouth feel leaves you wanting more. It is evident why all the reviews are what they are for Zombie Dust across the country at BA and other beer rating sites. This is an outstanding beer that you are bound to enjoy! As long as you like hops... If you don't the it is a wonder why you even drink beer. 474 charactersFB-Beersnob, Aug 11, 2014

4.35/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Imperial Pint. I had this three days after it was bottled. Nice.
Appearance: Hazy orange with good, off-white head and nice retention.
Smell: Grapefruit and orange, but it is by turns tangy, tart, sweet and bitter. Some spiciness as well.
Taste: Crazy Citra assault. As in the aroma, the citrus of grapefruit, orange and spiciness is at the forefront, but it is simultaneously sticky sweet, tangy tart and dryingly bitter. Interesting combination, but I see this with Lagunitas as well. Malt body provides balance but doesn't detract from the hop flavors.
Feel: Medium to full body that is very oily but appropriately drying on the finish. Moderately carbonated.
Overall: A top-notch APA that is very different from the old Cascade examples. That said, I don't feel that this is really any better than Lagunitas New Dogtown Pale Ale, which is easy to find. How much is the hype factor driving up the score on this, albeit excellent, beer? 982 charactersbsp77, Aug 10, 2014

In my opinion not a 100, probably a 98 and wouldn't argue with a 99. The fact is it isn't fair that this is #10 on the BA list simply because of people obsessed with three Floyd"s, compared to some of the other beers out there it really shouldn't be a 100. Don't get me wrong this beer is absolutely delicious but to compare it to some of the other 100"s and even some of the other APA's, like MO which is sooo underrated imo, it just isn't so much better that it deserves a 100. 584 charactersSkordi13, Aug 08, 2014

The line for carry outs was huge because they were selling ZD by the case. I should have grabbed some but little room in my suit case back to Florida. The beer on tap was superb!
A- The appearance looks like your typical pale ale but has excellent lacing from start to finish.
S - Smells like you would expect. Grapefruit, and a little pine.
T- The balance is perfect.  The IBU's are just right with the malt. I know a lot of people say ZD should be considered an IPA but if it were any more bitter it would dominate the beer. I think it is just bordering into IPA Land.  Grapefruit is definitely tasted but I also pick up a little orange flavor that has just the right amount of sweetness not to be cloying.
M - The beer goes down so smoothly. Definitely the most easily drinkable PA I've ever had.  You don't even think about the carbonation because it's perfect. I was anticipating a very drinkable beer and I was more than satisfied.
O - It was even better than expected. I know there is a lot of hype surrounding this pale ale but sitting in the tap room after having 2 pints of this beer all I can say is I loved it!  How much do I love it?  Let's just say that if I was alone on a desert island and a case of cold beer washed up onto the shore I would want it to be this beer.  There is a reason this beer is rated so damn high!
It's been a couple years since I wrote this review.  I've since travelled all over California and Vermont trying every PA/IPA I could get my hands on, as well as drinking some great IPAs in Florida.  Guess what?  I would still pick ZD for that desert island.
Just left FFF once again and I have to say that Permanent Funeral is even better than ZD. 1,740 charactersELS, Aug 07, 2014

Smell is fantastic , floral and fresh, west coast fragrance. Taste when it hits the tongue is same as smell but gives way to a belgian style flavor, not my style. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and beer is super fresh tasting. I tried it twice to make sure it wasn't an off day, but it wasn't. I would drink again for sure, but I wouldn't seek it out, just not my style of PA/IPA 498 charactersHopLover1, Aug 04, 2014

The pour kicks up a huge off-white frothy head that makes pouring the entire bottle at once difficult, and leaves sheets of lace until the beer is completely gone.
Aroma is wonderful dank hops - pine, grapefruit, oranges, hints of weed. Hints of sugar-cookie malts complement the hops while still allowing the hops to dominate. Exactly the type of aromas I love from hops.
The taste follows up on all the hop flavors from the nose. Even though it's technically only a pale ale, there is no doubt that this is a tongue-scraping hop assault - but just done at the perfect volume. It's bitter and drying, but not too much, and there's just enough of a kiss of smooth malt flavor to keep it in check. Aftertaste is dank hops and a bit of caramel and resin.
Mouthfeel is smooth and silky. Medium- to light-bodied, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Perfect for the style.
Overall, a really great pale ale - totally lives up to the hype. Nice hop profile, even if a bit one-dimensional, nice malt balance, nice mouthfeel, nice everything. Thanks to batfireman for the trade! 1,184 charactersMasterfulIdiot, Aug 01, 2014

A: light amber liquid, clear... creamy head, killer silken lace
S: first impression: b.o.... then: wildflowers, citrus zest and oily mist... fairly fragrant, earthy, but not explosive (the glass)
T: aggressively citrus-bitter... smooth malt... mostly spicy, resiny hops... fair amount of fruity-sweet resins... delicate grainy toast (NOT toasty grain) in the aftertaste
M: lightly gritty but clean, smooth flow, compact body... bit of a numbing sensation from the alcohol and bitterness in tandem
O: basically an IPA - the fact that they're calling it a pale ale, while it may be true relative to their hoppy beers, is a bit silly... it's an IPA... nothing out of the ordinary, flavor-wise, but it has a nice crisp attack and is undeniably, notably, solidly made 834 charactersBouleboubier, Jul 28, 2014

The smell was largely fruit, and especially tropical fruit. The taste, as others have said, more resembles that of an IPA as there isn't a whole lot of malt to balance it, but the fruit flavors are great, and it starts off sweet (but not too sweet) and does finish with some bitterness. It's moderately carbonated and goes down very easy. It's very, very similar to White Rajah (which is an IPA) in both smell and taste, but the mouthfeel and color are slightly different. Overall, this is excellent. Yes, it is definitely overhyped as it is not by any means earth shattering, but it is worth seeking. 719 charactersDeFaz, Jul 28, 2014

On tap into pint glass
A: Translucent copper color with a beige head that settled to nothing. Minor lacing.
S: Huge fresh hop smell with notes of tropical fruit including papaya and mango. Pine and resinous as well. 
T: Taste does not follow the nose too closely. Tropical comes through as unripe mango, which can be unpleansantly piney at times. There is an bitter hop flavor that is overwhelming. 
M: Moderate body and well carbonated.
D: The nose is extremely appealing with juicy citra hops and tropical fruit. Extremely fresh and "wet" hop profile. Taste is very good, though it falls a bit flat. The bitterness is a touch unpleasant, but overall it's a solid pale ale. 727 charactersantott0523, Jul 25, 2014

4.57/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5I got a bottle of Three Floyds Zombie Dust that was given to me Beer Jay. I've never had anything from Three Floyds before and I've been wanting to try this beer for a while and I'm happy Beer Jay gave me a chance to try it, so lets see how it goes. Less than two weeks old. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.
A- The label looks good, it goes nicely with the name and I think it's eye catching. It poured a nice orange color that took on more of a amber orange color when held to the light and it had a little over two fingers worth of slightly off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left some nice patchy lacing behind. This was a very nice looking beer, I have no complaints.
S- The aroma start off with a with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the fruity hops being the first to show up and they impart a great fruit aroma that mainly consists of citrus fruit aromas but there also some nice tropical fruit like aromas that come together to make for an aroma that is similar to pineapple orange juice and there's also some piney hops showing up in the background. Up next comes a nice and noticeable malt aroma with some lightly toasted, biscuit, slightly grainy and slight caramel malt like aromas that show up just enough. This beer had a awesome aroma, it was full of fruity hops and it had just enough malts to bring out some balance.
T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness followed by the fruity hops still being the first to show up and they still impart those same aspects that I got in the aroma with that great pineapple orange juice flavor sticking out the most and it seems like the piney hops stick out just a little more in the background than they did in the aroma. Up next comes the malts which impart the same aspects that they did in the aroma and they show up just enough. On the finish there's just a slightly higher amount of medium bitterness with a fruity hop and slightly piney aftertaste. This was a great tasting beer, the hop profile was really good and it still managed to have a little bit of balance to it.
M- Smooth, fairly crisp, refreshing, medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel was awesome and it worked great with this beer.
Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a world class example of an IPA, I know the brewery calls this is a Pale Ale and while it has some of the balance that a good Pale Ale should have it still tasted and drank just like an IPA. This beer had great drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, refreshing, not filling at all and the taste did a great job of holding my attention, I think I could drink a lot of these without even coming close to being bored with it, it's a great combination of taste and drinkability and I think it's a great beer to have on a warm day. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma and mouthfeel, to me those two aspects stood out just a little more than the others and they were both really well done. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't a single that about this beer that I disliked or would change, it's great just the way it is, but I do wish I could buy this in Michigan. I would for sure buy this beer if I had the chance and I wouldn't hesitate to grab a case of it. I would recommend this beer to everyone, it is truly one of those must try beers. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, with how famous it is in the craft beer scene I was expecting this to be a great beer and it ended up living up to that and it delivered in every aspect. This beer made for a great first impression for Three Floyds and I would love to try more of their beer. As a a Pale Ale, I'm pretty sure it's the best I've had and as an IPA it's up there in my top three for sure. Great job guys, this is one Awesome beer and It deserves all the recognition it gets. 3,992 charactersStoutHunter, Jul 21, 2014

Smell - Incredible nose, one of the very best from that standpoint.
Taste - I can' say enough about this brew, incredible taste - city hops flow through the palate - I get lots of sweet fresh mango
Feel - I feel like I never want this to end
Overall - One of the best beers I have ever had, no doubt- will always have a special place in my heart but can no longer give the perfect score I once did 469 charactersM_chav, Jul 20, 2014

TASTE: The Citra hops really shine through in the taste. Grapefruit & tangerine really hit the palette rup front. There is a slight orange rind like bitterness that lingers -- but it's refreshing and not overwhelming like some hop forward IPA's. 343 charactersjmbyerly, Jul 15, 2014

A - Perfectly clear orange hue. Decent head and retention. Didn't really pay much attention to this; was too excited to try!
S - God. Damn. What a brew. This thing is just gushing like they say, with grapefruit, pineapple, peach, mango, all sorts of tropical fruits. Some bread and biscuit comes through from the malts as well, but definitely in the background.
T - Nearly as amazing as the aroma, with all of the same flavors. I get more bready malt flavor than I did with PseudoSue, which is not my preference when it comes to pale ales and IPAs for the most part. Bitterness is quite tame, but for a pale ale, I can see why people might think it's closer to an IPA.
M - Light to medium bodied, but it goes down quite nicely with just the right amount of carbonation and texture. Can seem a little watery at times.
O - The best beer I had at FFF. Really neck and neck with Toppling Goliath's PseudoSue. The only thing I can say is that Zombie Dust has the better aroma, while PseudoSue has the better flavor. Hope to get around to this again! 1,085 charactersDemoniChris, Jul 06, 2014

S: Citrus, pineapple, other high alpha acid like aromas. Cracker like malts, lingering bitterness and soapy feel.
T: Citrus and pineapple up front and enjoyable. A strong soapy and oily flavor that reminds me of dish detergent. Faint cracker like malts, and linger bitterness.
M/D: A medium body and crisp carbonation. Again, that soapy and oily character is here which I am not particularly a fan of. Though a nice enough hoppy pale ale to drink on occasion.
A nice pale ale, that is basically an IPA. I have had this many times, and never really understood the appeal. Citra hops are strong for sure, but I am not a fan of the consistent soapy and oil character throughout. 782 characterschamp103, Jul 05, 2014

4.18/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Decided to try this because of all the very high recommendations and it's scarcity makes it that much more exciting.
A - Beautiful pale orange color with superior white head that sticks around. Good lacing for the most part. Very clear. Pours thick for an APA.
S - Great hoppy fragrance with a floral/citrus character that shines through. Has a dank hop character with some grassy notes. Very hop centered without much malt or alcohol in the nose. 
T - Has all the hops from the aroma with all the hoppiness . The front also has a sweetness from the malt to compliment the hop bitterness. Nice smooth finish with a medium bitterness from the hops. The last flavors on the palate are some sweet and delicious hops.
M - Medium mouth-feel. Has a nice bitterness that lightly sits on the back of the tongue. Fine carbonation.
Overall, this is an IPA and the only reason it's called an APA is because of the shadow Permanent Funeral and APW put it under. It's a great beer that has all of the citra hops you can sink your teeth into. I love the citrus hops and the body make it very drinkable. Perfect if you don't like overly bitter IPA's but would like a more citrus/hoppy pale ale. I could drink these for ever.

It poured with a short off white head that died down, leaving wispy patches of bubbles on the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass. 
S: Moderate aromas of tropical fruits stand out in the nose—mangos, papayas and pineapples seem to stand out in particular. If you close your eyes, you can almost picture yourself smelling a blend of tropical fruit juices. 
T: Following the smell, the taste is dominated by flavors of tropical fruits from the hops, the latter of which contribute a light amount of bitterness. No malts are perceptible. 
M: It feels just about medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. 
O: For an APA, this beer has strong tropical fruit aromas and flavors that surpass that from Double IPAs. It is also very easy to drink given the lighter body nature of the beer. 936 charactersmetter98, Jun 28, 2014

Appearance: ZD poured a cloudy honey color with a finger thick marshmallow colored foam floating on top; ultimately this settled to a thin film on the surface.
Smell: Sweet clover honey, pineapple, tangerine & grapefruit, hoppy floral notes dance around the glass. I get some bready malt notes as well. Great smelling beer.
Taste: Wow, the sweet-bitter balance is done perfectly here. Floral hoppiness, followed by a medley of citrus and honey and followed with the breadiness of the malt and the expected hop bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Creamy, body is full of carbonation but not overwhelming or overdone. Medium-dry finish.
Overall: Hands down, top 3 beers that I've had. Thanks Pintofbrown. 713 charactersdarthvohn, Jun 27, 2014

It's a fantastic beer; every sip tastes the same as the first - an explosion of citra hops with a slightly bitter finish. I could easily crush a full six pack in one night.
Wish ZD was easier to find in Ohio. However, there are some good local beers that taste similar. 327 charactersSwettenham_Shire, Jun 26, 2014

S - Malty, sweet, molasses smells, I also pick up a bread and a slight citrus. Aroma draws you into wanting a sip. Med to light aroma over all. Smells light a pale ale should.
T - Mild hops up front, layered with malts very well. Citrus mixed with the hops. Finishes clean with the sweet control but allowing the hops to stick around 
M - Med mouth/cream to this beer. Very smooth. The mouth feel draws you into wanting another sip.
O - This pale ale hits it on all notes, this is what I want in an ale, well balanced flavors, not to heavy or robust at all. Hops play well with malts and add just the right kick of citrus. 786 characterslionhrt9, Jun 25, 2014

3.96/5  rDev -12.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4My second Three Floyds offering, with the first being the fantastic Gumballhead. This is pretty good, not as good as the wheatiness and the extremely pleasant taste of Gumballhead, but definitely good on its own as a very solid, flavorful beer, unlike anything you'll get even if you roam the cluttered craft beer aisles at your local liquor store. Not sure if I'd shell out $13.99 - $17.99 (!) for a six pack, but it's definitely something to relish. 
However, even enjoying both these beers quite a bit, I question if, psychologically, Three Floyds' hype and frustratingly conservative distribution of these two beers has skewed my ratings from being what they would be if these beers were as common as Lagunitas. There's something to contemplate over your most recent longneck. 781 charactersSteveJeremy, Jun 22, 2014

Bottle that was 6 weeks old. 
Unique Hop profile, pretty sweet with some citrus, slightly creamy, moves toward slightly bitter at the very end. Very impressive. If I could get it easily I would keep some in the fridge. 289 charactersbcp5296d, Jun 19, 2014

Another review said it's like someone opened a grapefruit stand in the middle of a pine forest. I think that is right on. This is not a big beer, but it has a great flavor and drinkability. If I had to drink only one beer the rest of my life, this might be it, as just being perfect all around, even though there are more extreme beers with more flavor.
I tried this straight out of a very cold fridge, and didn't warm up to it (ha ha) until it warmed up a little and more smell and flavor came through. 531 charactersJerryG, Jun 15, 2014

S-Piney, acidic citrus notes hit the front of the nose followed by hops and rounded out with a nice sweetness of honey and flowers. 
T-A trio of bitterness hits the palate at first. Hops, citrus, and pine make up the front of the palate but do not overwhelm. The aforementioned notes blend perfectly with the sweet honey and flowers (maybe jasmine or calendula). Finishes with a nice, spicy bite
MF-Crisp and medium-bodied. Fells nice and thick for an APA. 
O-Damn good pale ale. I feel like so many more APA and pale ales are coming out now that this one is losing its prestige, but it's still a phenomenal brew. It's essentially everything a pale ale should be. 784 charactersJacurdy60, Jun 11, 2014

S: Array of tropical fruit no luring pineapple, grapefruit and orange. Notes of pine and bread.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation and a slight oily feel. 
O: a solid pale ale that I have had before, though this is the freshest I've had of ZD.
The pepper taste lingers and is a bit prominent for my preferred taste profile. 463 charactershillvt4me, Jun 06, 2014

It was poured into a small taster glass from the bottle and I could smell an intense passionfruit aroma before I even picked the glass up from the countertop. The nose on this thing absolutely blew my mind. Huge amounts of juicy tropical fruit amazingness. The flavor was the same and led me to believe that some sort of actual fruit was added to this beer, nope just citra hops! This may technically fit into the IPA category, but who cares....those lines have been blurred for a while now anyway. Cheers FFF, you did great with this one 685 characterskevobutler, Jun 05, 2014

S: a true delight: passion fruit, mangos, and musty orange peels; mild aroma of pine, too
T: dry sweetness upfront, followed by orange peel and tropical fruits; nice malty finish; so much flavor and so refreshing
M: this is where this beer excels: it leaves a thin coat of resin and tropical-fruit stickiness on my teeth; the beer is effervescent and medium-bodied, such that it feels light, sticky, and substantial at the same time

O-I've tried this beer several times now, even lucky enough to get it on tap on the east coast! I have to say it's slightly underwhelming given it's very high rank and reputation. However it's still a great APA that deserves to have it's name thrown around with the greats. 623 charactersTmyhre802, May 29, 2014

4.8/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I enjoyed this on tap at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier VT, served chilled in a tulip.
 The color is apricot shade of golden with hazed look and rings of lace cling with white head and fine bead. The smell is great strong citra scent with lots of pine and pineapple with mild zest of citrus with incredible amount of citrus hops in the aroma. The feel is great -just a touch of malt with plenty of hop bitterness and oils with med high bitterness in general and smooth oily dank resinous body with medium carbonation and semi-dry finish.
 The flavor starts with citrus zestiness and juicy tropical fruit -mild mango and pineapple flavors give way to juicy grapefruit and light pale malt with subtle herbal and almost grassy accents with pure hop goodness all the way through. Love the fact this has a balance of malt for the style yet not holding back any hop intensity at all with finesse in the flavor. Overall one of the best pales in existence if no THE best - very worth with the emphasis on Citra making for a enjoyable flavor from first sip to last with citra essence in each taste -incredibly drinkable. 1,116 charactersSlatetank, May 28, 2014

A: Pours a clear amber with about two fingers of off-white head.
S: A nice intense tropical, citrus aroma that begs you to take a sip. More specifically I detect grapefruit, pine, orange, and pineapple.
T: Resinous pine, orange, grapefruit, pineapple, pepper - A slight graininess and also mildly sweet.
M: Medium body, moderate to high carbonation. Slick, crisp, and moderately bitter.
O: ZD has been a long time want and doesn't leave me at all disappointed. While I have had better examples, this is definitely among the best Citra single hop beers out there. 608 charactersd5001986, May 28, 2014

From 12 oz bottle to pint glass
A: Sticky copper glow emits from this delightfully lit brew with an off-white head that dissipates quickly into a familiar IPA appearance. Props to the label art. 
S: Luscious hops on the front combined with an incredibly pleasant malt sweetness. It's a honeycomb, sweet tea like aroma that is oh so pleasantly blended with the basket of citrus. 
T: The balance here is a work of art. It's not overwhelmingly sweet and the hops are just enough to make this almost dangerously good...I've rarely had beers that live up to the hype but this is a close as you can get. Unbelievable. 
M: Hard to call it a "session beer" but this would be easy to enjoy round after round after round.

It leaves a great lacing on my pint glass. I can smell citrusy hops that wafts strongly from the glass. I don't have to be close to the glass at all to smell them. That being said, the smell is the only thing that disappoints me about this beer. It's lacking somehow that I can't quite put my finger on. The hops hit me immediately as I taste it but they're calmed down almost immediately by the sweet malt. Neither the hops or the malt is overpowering. The mouth feel is very balanced, not too heavy...not too light. As it lingers in my mouth, I can feel a distinct bite tingling in my mouth. Overall it's a great beer. What impresses me the most is how well balanced it is. 762 charactersW9820, May 25, 2014

L- Pours a partly cloudy golden color with a three finger head. Good head retention and healthy lacing, as well.
S- The aroma is huge with notes of grapefruit, hop bitterness, and a hint of sweet malt trying to peak through. This is an excellent showcase of citra hops, and one of the best hoppy-aromas I've encountered.
T- Grapefruit and huge hop bitterness with almost no malt to speak of. It's delicious, to be sure, but totally one-note.
F- Sticky, bitter mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Slight alcohol burn.
O- Amazing aroma, and a truly delicious beer. Doesn't live up to the hype for me, as there are plenty of excellent hoppy beers that are more readily available. Still quite good. 801 charactersdjgustafson, May 24, 2014

Super drinkable, almost English-style West coast IPA. Not totally dry, either. Just really juicy and citrusy. 379 charactershreb, May 23, 2014

4.14/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Pours a lightish golden chrome. Nice head/lacing.
Nose has a fruitiness - quite a lot of onion. There are some nice floral and malt notes behind that. Hint of honey. Initially quite muted and almost a sour hint. Over time, more malt comes out. Notes of tomatoes. Cookie dough, cookies and cream ice cream.
Taste is quite malty- bit of fruity hops. More fruitiness develops in the taste as it warms- more balanced delicious apricotty and figgy goodness.
Mouthfeel is watery, thin and dry. Nice, like a spritzer. Surprising bitterness in spite of a thinnish body.
Think it was dated 01/15/14, but the first two digits were nigh on illegible. This date does make sense though- the beer was probably a bit faded- then again it is only 4 months old.
A little underwhelming considering its reputation, I've had other pale ales which hold up better with only 4 months of age, but definitely has its charm. 903 charactersdanieelol, May 21, 2014

The aroma of this IPA is among my absolute favorites. Light citrus scents with slight piney notes made be very excited to take a sip. The sip, however started well, but took an odd turn for me. The lighter citrus flavors on the initial sip turn to an odd late skunky bitterness blended with some malt flavors. I definitely enjoyed the smell more than the taste, but an overall great offering from a great brewery. 532 charactersDawgboned37, May 20, 2014

From 12 oz bottle to pint glass
A: Copper-tan in color, opaque with chilled haze, a gentle pour creates a tight, 1-inch head that leaves cascading lacing around the glass.
S: Hop-forward bouquet with big citrus-y notes, distinctly grapefruit-y. Honeyed malts and earthy tea notes round the bouquet.
T: The flavors follow the nose, with crisp citrus notes at the front, quickly followed by notes of honey and earthy, floral aspects. Incredibly balanced palate, the finish is short, bittersweet and leaves little residue between sips.
M: Deceptively light on the palate, well carbonated. This is as easy to throw back as they come.
I've had a lot of good hoppy ales lately, especially all of the amazing sessionable IPA's coming out locally. But this is right up there with the best. I've been able to try this at bottle sharing sessions, but it was great to sit down and review my own bottle. 933 charactersrand, May 20, 2014

This beer is an orange-gold radiance to it. It pours very nicely. Leaves a thumb width head when served from a tap or poured from a bottle. The smell has a faint citricey smell followed by a grainey finish (for those of you that have looked at a couple of my other reviews, I state that I am a big fan of anything citrus flavored). This smell got me kind of excited. With the first taste of this awesome beer, I did pick up hints of grapefruit and then a strong bold taste that I'm not used to experiencing (again, just starting to delve into IPA's and APA's) all the way to the finish. The beer had nice viscosity and felt nice all the way across the palate. After the first beer I was a big fan and have had many bottles since. I am fortunate enough to live within a hours drive of FFF and have made a couple trips to pick up cases of ZD. I will be drinking this beer many times again down the road.

Beer pours a nice clear orangy golden yellow with decent amount of head and lacing. Not too murky, probably on the darker side given the style.
On the nose it just smells like sweet hops, really citrusy, sweet, delicious. Simple but amazing.
Flavor wise, it starts off with a tiny hoppy bite, I'd say more like a nibble. Then the sweet citrusy hops just take over and wash all that away. Its not a very complex beer, but man the hops are killer. Definitely critus flavor domination, not much florally hops going on at all. Also, not bitter at all.... I really don't normally like hoppy stuff that much but this beer has changed my mind a little bit.
Mouthfeel is incredible too, this beer goes down so easy and so smooth. Its so wet (not dry at all), fruity and sweet its almost like a candied beer. Every sip you take just beckons you to take an even bigger swig each time. I finished mine extremely fast, rest of my buddies were still sipping theirs and mine was done, I'm usually about halfway done with my drinks when people are finished. I kind of wish I had savored mine more...
This is a case of doing something really simple, really, really well. A finely crafted brew for sure, would definitely snag this again if I had the chance. 1,375 charactersbens0n, May 18, 2014

This beer looks nice, but the bang I was expecting was not there. The smell was severely lacking, the mouthfeel was weak, and the taste was blah.
I don't know if I received a bad bottle, or if my taste has changed due to the fact that I have been exclusively bee drinking stouts over the last couple of month. 
I will revisit this review again in the future.
UPDATE - 01/27/15

4.76/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75On cask at the Old Toad during their cask festival.
Pours a clear golden yellow. Small amount of floaties. Small half inch head.
Smells like citrus fruits and juices.
The flavor is slightly more muted than I'd expect. I don't usually love hoppy beers in a cask, and this promotes that for me. Slightly watery, with some citrus flavors coming through. Low bitterness.
Cask style mouthfeel- small amount of lively carbonation. Crisp.
Would love to give this another shot from the bottle or a normal keg.
EDIT:
Had a bottle with stillmatic2232 (thanks a million, man) that blew me away far more than the above cask version did, so I'm going to update my rating and provide a new quick review. Original ratings 4/4/4/4.25/4.
Pours out a hazy honey orange, with a 3/4 inch fizzy head, and tons of lacing on the glass.
Smells just incredible- tons of citrus fruit- lemon, orange, pineapple, with some grassy aromas too.
The taste is similar. Just pure Citra hop goodness. Not much malt flavor, just a ton of juicy fruit flavors, the specific fruits are mentioned above. Just goes down incredibly easy.
Light bodied, but full in flavor. Medium carbonation, crisp smooth mouthfeel.
One of the best American Pale Ales on the market. Simply amazing. 1,251 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 08, 2014

It is my go to beer. Every time I see it is available at the brewpub I make sure I run by to pick up a six pack. The art work on the box is awesome as we'll.

S: pretty tropical smell. Orange, mango, pineapple lime, mixed with a very balancing bread and biscuit malt.
T: follows the nose pretty spot on. Tropical fruits and a little mint in the background with a nice balanced bready and biscuit malt. Pretty hoppy but also pretty balanced with the malts.
M: pretty creamy mouthfeel with a lingering bitter finish. Pretty mouth drying
O: damn tasty beer and glad i traded for it. Full flavored and full body for a lower alcohol than most IPAs but definitely matches the hoppiness. One of the best all citra beers i''ve had. 697 charactersjageraholic, May 07, 2014

Pours out a dark orange in color with no translucence. Nice white, one-finger head with decent retention and some nice lacing.
Smell is fruity mango, orange, pineapple as one would expect from Citra hops. There is a TINY bit of bitterness in the background that is very hard to notice. Definitely some nice sweet malts in the background.
Taste is a tiny bit more bitter but the prized fruits mentioned above come through and shine with the sweetness of the malts. Very well balanced.
Mouthfeel is fairly thick for the style due to the carbonation which I really like.
Overall I always love Zombie Dust and plan on trying to trade for a couple fresh 6 packs. Really a well put together beer that is even better on tap. When this stuff is even more fresh it is one of my favorites and a perpetual want. 902 charactersTheBeerDrinker, May 04, 2014

Couldn't wait to get it home to crack a cold one open. Great hop presence on the nose. Citrus dominated nose with some tropical fruits layered in there. Nice carbonation and mouth feel. Great malt presence with fantastic levels of hop bitterness. Never makes your mouth feel abused by the hops. Just really well made beer. 388 characterskingston2, May 03, 2014

A- pours a bright and clear amber color with a two-finger foamy and creamy white head that retains nicely, leaving some thick patches of lace behind
S- big kick of pungent hops up front with notes of grapefruit, orange peel, fresh cut grass, mango, mint leaves and guava. Underlying sweet malt adds a light aroma of fresh baked bread 
T- tropical fruity hop notes up front mix with some grassy and floral notes, fresh mint, leafy and herbal. Malty sweetness kicks in that balances the hops nearly perfectly, adding slightly toasty flavor with a sweet finish 
M- medium body with medium prickly carbonation lead to a foamy mouthfeel and a crisp finish 
O- It's impressive how they manage to pack that much hop punch into the beer, yet still keep it balanced like a good pale ale. It took me for years to land a bottle of this stuff and it's definitely one of the three best pale ales I've had to date. 947 charactersTreyliff, Apr 30, 2014
4.72/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Does it live up to the hype? The flavor is massive, and the aroma even more of an achievement. The balance, unparalleled.
A beautiful pour, a hazy straw color with a bright-white rocky head and serious lacing. 
Intensely complex aroma of sweet/tart grapes, honey, and white grapefruit.
Flavor in the mouth brings mango and sweet muffin, at once, plus a roaring floral bitterness. Sweet bread in the middle, navel-orange, ripe tomato, Juicy Fruit gum.
This has redefined my Top 5 non-big-beers of all time: Zombie Dust at the top, then Hitachino Nest While Ale, Saison de Lente, New Belgium La Folie, and Rodenbach Grand Cru.
If you've paid the going rate ($12/6-pk.), then you've got liquid gold. Couldn't possibly find a more flavorful, impressive beer at 6.5% abv or less. 779 charactersmartyl1000, Apr 30, 2014

A - Slightly hazed orange gold with one finger of fizzy white head, little lacing.
S - Aroma is so legit. Orange juice, grape juice, lime zest, grapefruit, papaya, a little pineapple, light base malt.
T - Taste kinda falls short for me, though its incredibly drinkable, light refreshing grape and grapefruit flavor, citrus zest, mild bread malt, light grassiness.
M - Fresh, lighter and drinkable.
O - The aroma in this beer is incredible, love that part, the flavor though is good and very drinkable, just doesnt match the aroma by any means. Glad to have had it. Big thanks to my friend Chuck for hooking me up with one. 649 charactersOmnium, Apr 29, 2014

Being new to the beer game I wouldn't fully trust myself either. But I finally had the opportunity to enjoy a bottle of Zombie Dust, which has gained a special mystique in Indiana. 
The limited supply and availability make everyone crave this beer, however I agree with Bishop that it is semi-overrated. It is a delicious beer with a cool crisp drink, nice hazy color, and a terrific nose. However, my friend who hates IPA and Pale Ales enjoyed this beer more than myself. 
 It is delicious with a great taste, nose, and finish, but I would not rank it top 250 either. 642 characterskjoe19, Apr 22, 2014

I've always been a fan of Three Floyds, and I was happy to finally try this- it did not disappoint. Beautiful beer, with a burnished gold color contrasted with a stark white head that leaves some decent lacing. Citrus and herbal aromas with a touch of grain. Clean and fresh smelling. The taste is where it's at. Clean citrus and a touch of clean sweet malt. Candied grapefruit peel followed by a long spicy hop finish. All very pleasant and quaffable. I'd drink this all the time if I had access to it. 585 charactersGeorgiabeer, Apr 16, 2014

A - Pours a med amber/orange with a bit of a haze that increases with the age of the beer. About one finger of head that doesn't dissipate too quickly with decent lacing. 
S - You can detect the citrus coming from the hops immediately. A little bit of pine & some bready malts
T - Crazy hopped up ale. Great citrus and pine up front and finishes with a great sweet malt
M - Smooth w/ great carbonation. Medium body.
O - It's not as good as you may have heard, it's better! Not you're usual APA with some of the best hop flavors and smells you'll ever come across. My favorite part is how drinkable this APA is. Most beers with this much flavor aren't nearly as smooth. Well worth the time and effort it takes to find... "It's Not Normal" 889 charactersSnOwRiDe1080, Apr 16, 2014

Had this on tap at The Tap craft beer bar in Bloomington, IN. Had it in bottles many other times, but nothing compares to fresh from the tap. A hazy golden color with a surprisingly creamy head for a pale ale. Smell is fantastic; pine, citrus, flowers. Taste was smooth and biting all at once, a true masterpiece of a pale ale. 383 charactersajcuster89, Apr 15, 2014

Mild and smooth palate with bitterness coming on strong in the long, crisp finish. Pine and malt come through strongly, mouth feel is light and clean
Overall:
I really like this beer, it seems to get overshadowed by the gumball head, but I submit that this is the superior brew. Its easily drinkable, not too over the top and very well balanced

This is a nice APA that I could drink over and over. Pours a hazy dirty-orange with an off-white head. It has an amazing tropical fruit aroma, which carries over to the taste, combined with a perfect balance of bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but maybe that's what makes it so drinkable. Overall, a very approachable APA that I wish they sold in my neighborhood. 474 charactersFFreak, Apr 08, 2014

Appearance:  Pours with a nice, solid white head that lingers.  Beautiful amber-orange color with LOTS of vigorous bubbles cascading upwards.  The head leaves some nice lacing on the glass as it goes down.
Smell:  Oh, the hops and the pine smell!  This is *much* better than when I had a pint at a tap takeover back in early 2014.  Crisp, hoppy, pine at its best.
Taste:  Probably about on par with PseudoSue.  Really smooth, really bright with the pine and hops.
Feel:  The pine aftertaste definitely lingers, but it goes down really smooth.
Overall:  I'm perfectly ok paying $2.99 every once in awhile for this at Discount Liquor.  It comes close to the hype. 704 charactersdon1481, Apr 03, 2014

S-This legendary, Citra-induced tropical fruity hop bomb lives up to it's reputation in the nose. An amplitude of citrus, mango, nectarine and bright green grass. 
T-Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, apricot, moss, grass and on and on and on. A superabundance of Citra! It also has a soft maltiness that reminds me of biscuits. When done right, this hop brings forth the most pleasurable aromas and flavors...and it was clearly done right here.
M-Medium bodied. Somewhat resinous. High, lingering bitterness. Still maintains an exceptional level of drinkability. Lasting aftertaste.
O-Holds its own with any IPA...because it is an IPA . Was probably my most  sought after beer up until finally trying it. It almost lives up to the hype. 865 charactersVelvetExtract, Apr 03, 2014

A: Pours a slightly hazed orange color with a one finger foamy cream colored head. Nice retention and some good lace spackled down the glass with each sip.
S: This smells really really good. Ripe tropical fruit notes mix with a spicy pine base. Mango, peach and pineapple with some musty pine in the background. A bit of caramel malt in the back as well.
T: Opens with some pine and just a trace of overripe mango. Middle brings a touch of grapefruit, tangerine and grapefruit pith, which dries things out pretty nicely. Finish shows a little caramel, lingering pink grapefruit pith and some nice pine resin without becoming overly bitter. Fantastically hoppy without sacrificing balance. And drinkable for days. This is awesome stuff. 786 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 01, 2014

The aroma is freaking huge. It’s wonderful how the aroma is so great being a single hop Citra. Tons of sweet citrus with orange, lemon zest, peach, pineapple juice. There's a bit of a malt backbone. A zesty, spritzy aroma. An incredibly addictive smell.
The flavor is different as the fruits only really hit in the front of pineapple, orange, papaya with a hint of sweetness. However, that cuts off with a big note of pink grapefruit throughout with a combination of bitterness and drying throughout. The beer is extremely dry. The finish has light pine, herbacious, grapefruit peel, which is spot on for Citra hops.
The mouthfeel is medium minus.
A very clean drinking beer. It reminds me of white wine or saison with how dry the beer is. It is different because it has this light malt body, and simply injects hop juice onto the palate and then leaves the mouth extremely empty and dry for me. 967 charactersdar482, Mar 31, 2014

A-Great amber color, poured to a nice head and held it for about 1/2 the glass.
S-I got a caramel smell, and maybe a hint of honey. Not a big smeller, by any means
T-First a nice push of hops, and then a big shot of mango followed by a shot of malt. This held the flavor right through. Hoppiness without the heavy bitterness. This was my favorite part for sure.
M-Good carbonation, and extremely smooth.
This is one of my favorites from 3 Floyds. 549 characterskgncfl, Mar 25, 2014

Pours a peachy orange with decent head and some lacing. Aroma is very citrusy and in the flavor, fresh peaches jumps out as well as green hops. Full bodied, carbonation high but not overly so. This was good but overall left me a bit wanting. Still very happy to have tried it. 362 characterspapat444, Mar 24, 2014

bottled 3/06/14 - super fresh
Big thanks to Yoshi Optimator for this one. 
A - Pours a clear golden amber color with a tall fluffy head that throws some pretty lacing and great retention.
S - An onslaught of pungent hops, bright citrus, ruby red grapefruit, orange oil, lemon, lime, mango, sweet pale malts, 
T - Big burst of candied citrus right off the top with some tropical and pine coming in right after. Very juicy with wonderful sweet balance from the malts. Bitterness is soft but the citrus permeates the palate leaving behind grapefruit zest after snappy and crisp finish.
M - Smooth feel, medium soft carbonation, medium weight.
This was a very fresh bottle. A citra wonderland. Very juicy and bursting with flavor. The balance of everything in this beer is pretty remarkable. It was worth the wait. 863 charactersStaveHooks, Mar 23, 2014

Pours out with a orange body and a white head. Leaves plenty of lacing around the glass and has good retention.
As soon as the cap let out air from the bottle fruity hop aroma erupted out. That is what I like see(smell). There is some caramel maltiness to it. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange, peach.
Grapefruit comes out a lot in the flavor. The bitterness washes away pretty quickly leaving the mouth dry and able to pull bready malt and apricot like hop flavor off the palate. It drinks smooth. 517 charactersMattSweatshirt, Mar 21, 2014

Smell: Best part of ZD is the smell.  The Citra hops bring out a fruity, dank smell that is hard to top.
Taste: Grassy, fruity, with a solid malt back-bone.  Not bitter at all.  
Feel: Medium bodied and smooth all the way down.  Clean and no bitterness is left over.
Overall: One of the best pale ales in the world.  A great showcase of the Citra hop.  Be sure to drink it fresh! 411 characterstmryan21, Mar 21, 2014

12 oz bottle, 8 days old, poured into a snifter
A- A clear golden amber color with a two finger white head.
S- Pungent, I could smell the second I opened it, grapefruit, citrus, pineapple, some pine, some bready malts.
T- Citrus, grapefruit, grapefruit rinds, piney finish, some bready and caramel malts, great balance.
M- Smooth, dry finish, medium body.
O- Tastes more like a great IPA than a Pale Ale. Lives up to the hype. If I could buy this all the time I would. 500 characterslarryi86, Mar 21, 2014

Good carbonation, very smooth finishes nicely. Overall, this is everything I hoped it would be, and rarely can i make such a statement. 391 charactersmjstacker, Mar 18, 2014
4.37/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance of a nice pale ale - bright golden orange, bright white foamy head with some tinges of yellow. Aroma of big citrus, pine, and some resin. This particular batch has a cannabis dankness of pine and grapefruit, which is very nice. Some biscuit, bready malt comes through more than anticipated. Taste is vibrant and well balanced - orange, grapefruit, pine, resin, some malt. 
About as good a pale ale can be - tons of flavor for the size of the beer. 459 characterstimc100, Mar 17, 2014

One of my favorite beers. A nice citrus nose, and a hint of honey, very pleasant. Citrus hops, grapefruit and maybe a little melon or mango, and honey again, with a bit of maltiness, and not overly bitter aftertaste. A well balanced ale. Bonus points for the sweet artwork. Deserving of the ratings it receives, and not ridiculously priced for such a great beer. This APA presents as an IPA. Glad I was lucky enough to get some to New England. 514 characterstheIPAman, Mar 17, 2014
4.27/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A: Hazy burnt orange, solid velvety-looking head with great retention. Lacing is pretty good. The body has all kinds of particulates in it (made with real zombie dust??), but they add to the appearance- they look like glitter. A solid stream of bubbles wafts up from the center of the glass, with a few other individual bubbles around the periphery. In short, immaculate.
S: A wide array of fruits, from orange to mango to pineapple, with some softer sweetness to tame it. I want to say there's something biscuity as well. Clear as heck, but the aroma fades a little too quickly.
T: Again, wide array of fruits with moderate pine, good bitterness that is balanced beautifully with mild sweetness. The balance between the two really is phenomenal; they know they have the hop bitterness, they don't need to prove anything by not taming it with malts. Finish is nice, the pine comes through more, and it is lasting; I can taste it on my breath minutes after my last sip.
M: Creamy, but crisp and lively with carbonation. Somewhere between medium and full-bodied.
O: OK, fine, this beer really is that good. Everything about it is a step above the rest- fantastic and unique appearance, exceptional balance between bitterness and sweet-seeming fruitiness AND showing the true potential that hops have besides 'citrus and pine' (other breweries take note), and somehow making a non-abrasive but refreshing mouthfeel. Congrats, Three Floyds, you've won me over. 1,460 characters1000lbgrizzly, Mar 17, 2014

Aroma: out of this world - strong citrus, pineapple - akin to a hopped fruit salad (all Citra)
Mouth feel: creamy, light very easy drinking, perfect carbonation for the style
Taste: Sweet hop forward, malty in the middle, nice clean dry citrus bitter finish - nothing offensive to the taste buds (this might actually be a good beer for those who are afraid to try hoppy beers). A very unique pale ale to say the least, very balanced. Alcohol is almost non existent
Overall: an excellent pale ale - worth the extra effort to buy online
(Note: I am brewing a ZD recipe I found online so I am hoping to replicate this in the comforts of my own home)

Just scored 2 cases. Re-review same as before. Worth the hoopla. One thing I notice with this batch is long dry aftertaste/finish. One of my favorite beers. 498 charactersmayor55, Mar 16, 2014

A-Looks just like any other pale ale, but its got this cloudy haze I enjoy, and the head is super fluffy like it came out the tap.
S- Straight pineapple peach graprfruit yumminess. Havent smelled a beer that smelled this good since Victory Hop Ranch(HR was better IMO) Definition of hop bomb.
T-Wow, this is tasty. Its got flavor enough to make me think its a DIPA, which it definitely isnt. Big pine and citrus flavor. Maybe a lil peach or mango, Its bitter, but I wish it was just a tad more. Very sweet. Zero malt flavor, but then again, Im pretty sure thats the idea.
M-The only place where Id say its lacking. Its appearance and explosion of flavor leave just a bit heavier mouthfeel to be expected. 
Overall, its a solid offering, but just like every other 3F beer, it costs too much and is over hyped. Reminds me of Two Hearted, and thats at least 3 bucks cheaper and has more ABV.

Pours nice medium amber with minimal head that rapidly disappears.
Smells fantastic. Citrus hoppiness, a touch of pine with good bready malts.
Tastes very balanced. Not overwhelming. This APA reminds me in profile very much of a traditional west coast IPA. It's very drinkable with really nice mouthfeel.

Thanks to Brewzma for this!
A- A very deep gold that has a reddish hue when held up to the light. the head is maybe a half inch which quickly dissipates into a then lacing.
S- a blast of citrus hops followed by a sweet malt that reminds me of honey. Definitely some lemon and orange and grapefruit in there. A piney resin swirls into the nose after the malt. a very very pleasant smell.
T - This is the bread and butter of the beer. It doesn't really taste like a pale ale but it's still delicious. it tastes very much like the smell with citrusy notes hitting the tongue first, followed by pine and then finishing with a sweet malt taste. The bitter hops rest on your tongue for serveral minutes after it goes down. 
M - very smooth for such a hoppy beer. the carbonation doesn't bite and it goes down smooth albeit bitter. 
O - a very delicious beer. I understand why some people don't count this as a pale ale but whatever it is, it is delicious and very well crafted. I definitely think it meets the hype. More please! 1,100 charactersmlhyatt, Mar 11, 2014

Appearance: Pours a deep honey/amber and leaves a finger of white head that slowly fades to a rim around the glass.
Smell: Pine and mango, tropical fruits, a dash of resin, a nice level of "dank" to it as well. Really nice, hop-dominated aroma. 
Taste: Pine, resin, big mango, grapefruit, blood orange, honey, malts. Really nice combination of hop flavors. Super hop dominant, which works well on this one. Delicious.
Mouth-feel: Well carbonated with a medium, slightly sticky body. Wonderful feel to it. Finishes crisp and clean.
Overall: This is a wonderful, easy drinking, hop bomb. The flavor is really nice and not commonplace. I wish I could get more this, it would be my go-to for sure. 808 charactersResuin, Mar 08, 2014

APPEARANCE: poured a hazy burnt amber with an off white pillowy head. Lots of sticky lacing. 
AROMA: Very dank, herbal and hoppy. Bright fruits, grapefruit lots of lemon. Hints of wet grass, bready malts on the backend. 
TASTE: Lots of grapefruit on the front. Very oily like a zombie stirred this with his finger. Citrus notes pop again in the middle with the hops before finishing with Carmel and pale malts. 
MOUTHFEEL: medium body with medium carbonation. Slick and oily with snappy finish that leaves you wanting another sip. 
OVERALL: I had to keep reminding myself this is a pale ale. It drinks wonderfully and has such a good hop presence that it could be a mellow ipa. Lived up to the hype that surrounds it. The art work is amazing!

A - Pours a dark orange. Minimal carbonation. 2 finger head with strong lacing. Mostly opaque but clean. 
S - Citrus. Mostly orange. A little muted by comparison. 
T - Hop forward by APA standards but not a hop bomb. A little malt in the background but nothing too potent. Citrusy hops. Good but nothing earth-shattering. 
M - Pretty clean finish. Mild bitterness on the tongue. Semi-dry finish. 
O - It's a really good APA. It's not a the revelation that people want to think it is. Although it's not super fresh, I still think a 7 week old beer should not fall off this quickly. I would definitely order this if given the opportunity. 705 charactersPSU_Mike, Mar 06, 2014

Smell: clear fruity hop aroma. Ranges from citrus to tropical fruits. Not quite juicy but very flavorful. Sweet to grainy malt background. 
Taste: opens up with citrus mixed with tropical fruit noted. Maybe some grapefruit, but not too bitter, mango, papaya. Low resiny hop character. Malt background comes through with a honey like sweetness. 
Mouthfeel: medium body. Too low of a bitterness. And not quite juicy enough. 
Overall: this beer has a lot of good flavors but falls short in the mouthfeel. Needs a little bit of a bite to it or additional juicy hop characteristics. All in all it's nothing out of this world. Just a well done and good beer that is way to hard to find and sought after 833 charactersSportsandJorts, Mar 04, 2014
5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Some beers deserve the reputation they get. This is one of them. I was lucky to get a fresh bottle and it did not disappoint. 
Appearance- Perfect golden/amber color. Slight head, nice lacing. And I have to add the label is pretty cool. 
Smell- Amazing. The small was outstanding. Citrus on a canvas of floral hops. 
Taste- Crisp citrus start, well balanced with intense hop, and a nice finish that doesn't leave a bitter after taste. The closest think I can compare it to in my area is GL Chillwave, which is a double IPA, but has the citrus punch (I find chillwave to have maybe a bit to much lemon/lime flavor). 
Mouthfeel- medium to light body. 652 charactersCLEmark, Mar 04, 2014

Appearance- Really good looking golden hazy color with a very very slight amber hue when poured into a proper IPA glass.
Smell- The smell is perfect in my opinion, fruit notes, mild earthy graininess to it. Just awesome aroma.
Taste- Damn near perfect. Fruit and slight earthiness like its aroma. It's rival Pseudo Sue is a just a tad better, but I've had Pseudo Sue on tap and fresh bottles recently, so it's hard to tell exactly.
Mouthfeel- Perfectly done. Velvety smooth, wouldn't change a thing about it. 621 charactersWreckedPalate, Mar 02, 2014

Seriously, I waited for this? 
Maybe it was the first beer or one of the first to showcase citra hops, and to burst the crap out of it with flavor additions up the wazoo, but flash forward to 2014 and it's just a regular old pale ale that is as ubiquitous in flavor as it is pretentious in notoriety. 521 characterssmmeier819, Mar 02, 2014

Smell is citrus up front. Mainly grapefruit with some nice pine accents. Very inviting. 
Taste is grapefruit, sweet orange, bitter hops with hints of bready malt to balance it out nicely. 
The texture is medium bodied with medium carbonation. 
This one is certainly citrus and hop forward but, the flavors are balanced so well. No flavor overpowers any of the others. Wonderful aromas and silky mouthfeel. Very impressive. 558 charactersFurlinator, Mar 02, 2014

It pours a beautiful golden with partly cloudy and some head and lace. Very pretty in the glass. The aroma is perfect. It is strong and piney smelling. Complex and hoppy. Totally appealing. 
The taste follows suit, with a cleanliness often missing from big ambitious brews. It finishes bitter and crisp. This is an awesome brew and I need to get me a bunch more. It would be cool to drink a few of these instead of just one. 635 charactersschoolboy, Mar 01, 2014

Bottled 1/7/14. Interesting comic-bookish label art in multi-metallic colors.
Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into an Innis & Gunn flute. 
a: An appealing clear dark gold with an inch tall offwhite head which receded to thin surface foam and dense lacing. Little other detectable carbonation.
s: Intense pine resin.
t; Intense pine up front over a medium malt base. Bitterness lingers on the sides of the tongue, a little throat burn too. Soon all that softens and a pleasant floral aftertaste emerges, leaving the impression you've been drinking some sort of ambrosia rather than beer..
m: Moderate, good body, yet seems somehow lighter than it is. Probably the flavor makes it seem so.
o; A tasty and powerfully hoppy ale, well deserving its place among the top brews available. Great combination of appearance, aroma, flavors, hop bite, aftertaste, mouthfeel - this 'un has it all. Unfortunately I'm not expecting to get any more anytime soon. 1,140 charactersscotorum, Feb 27, 2014

M: A medium bodied, effervescent mouth-feel.

S- Citra hops explode out of the glass. I am a sucker for this hop and the ZD does an outstanding job of highlighting the aroma of it. Sweet caramel notes in the background.
T- Layers of flavors, especially at this low of an ABV. An elaborate hop profile balanced with a chewy, caramel candy smoothness. Bright flavors of pineapple, mango, and papaya. Some hoppy pales and IPAs fail to generate a true balance and continuity, but no such problem here.
M- Crisp, yet creamy. Mid body. Intense bitterness that lingers. 
O- There are very few beers that can bring such an intense, aggressive, and tantalizing hop level cascading throughout each sip and still find a way to make it smooth. FFF is rare to disappoint. ZD is right there with Dreadnaught in my opinion. 877 charactersBosoxfan20, Feb 26, 2014

Appearance: Pours the perfect color for a pale ale. An amber color with an orange hue. Thin white head dissipated, leaving both lacing and a small residual amount on the beer surface
Smell: Very hoppy smell. I get a floral bouquet and pine smell. Amazing.
Taste: Taste is damn near perfect. Get the same tastes as what I smell. A touch of breadiness and citrus.
Mouthfeel: matches the style completely. Perfect balance of malt and hops without being overly bitter. 
Overall: I was worried that this beer wouldn't live up to the hype that people give it. It has lived up to my expectations and is the best pale ale that I have had. Love the floral taste and smell and would gladly trade for more of this. 730 charactersTony_D, Feb 25, 2014

1/5  rDev -77.9%look: 1 | smell: 1 | taste: 1 | feel: 1 |  overall: 1I was so very disappointed with this beer, given all the hype associated with it. My friends are all like, "Oh, try this beer, you'll love it!" But this is the United States of America, and just because everyone else treats a beer like a heroin addiction, does not mean I do too. I've seen people refuse to drink anything but this and Gumball Head, and you know what? They don't drink very often. Well, I happen to like beer, but for as hard as it is to get this one, plus, the watery body and flavor of it, I happen to think this one blows. But, to each their own. This is not the best beer in the world people. If you enjoy driving to 25 different liquor stores and wasting countless amounts of time and money just attempting to find a single six pack, which is usually the limit if you can if you do find any, then by all means America, go right ahead. The people responsible for the hype are the same people who made Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber famous. That being said...

Moderately heavy nose. Floral, pine, grassy, robust, well rounded, airy. 
Medium viscosity for a pale, deep, smooth, easy drinker. Nice rounded dry flavors of pine, mild orange rind, nutty, bread, zero sweetness. VERY DRY!!! Nice and smooth lingering dry earthy bitterness. Great even coverage. It's pretty damn tough to earn a 5 for mouthfeel, but this one has done it! Carbonation is very light an well applied. Flavors are a bit light, but that's just the way they should as a Pale. 
A bit more of an IPA than a pale, Especially at 6.4%, but nice a solid flavorful, smooth beer. Pretty freaking solid brew, definitely recommend, but don't take out a second mortgage, it's just a Pale... 827 characterschugalug06, Feb 21, 2014

Taste: I get a lot of the citrus right away followed by a bitter dankness. 
Mouthfeel: A little dry for me, nice carbonation. Has a bit of an aftertaste that hangs around for a while.
Overall: This is one of my favorite beers. Super dank, taste almost like weed to be honest. If you like Citra hops this is your brew. I like a lot of Three Floyd's, but this is one my favorite from them. Definitely worth trying. I get it regularly and use whatever I don't drink as trade bait. 716 characterslanciloti, Feb 18, 2014

A: golden/lt orange with one to two finger head in pint glass
S: Bright, citrus up front. Great nose.
T: I continue to see why people rave over this one. Crisp, hop forward but the balance of hops is just right with bittering and flavoring. Orange citrus notes balance the bitterness. Not crushing but plenty for IPA fans. Easy to drink. 
M: Not to thin--just right. Good carbonation.
O: What can I say that hasn't been said? Closer to a traditional American IPA but who cares what you call it? Wears out other pale ales like Dale's. Fantastic-exceeded expectations. 617 characterssurfcaster, Feb 16, 2014

3 Floyds Brewing – Zombie Dust
Style: American Pale Ale
ABV %: 6.4
Overview: 3 Floyds Brewing Company has been brewing artisanal craft beer or as they call them “abnormal ales” since 2000. Zombie Dust, the king of the American Pale Ale (APA), rated #1 for the APA style on both BeerAdvocate.com and RateBeer.com. The availability is very limited due to the Citra hop variety used in this flavorful brew. In fact, until recently, this beer was only available locally at 3 Floyds Brewpub in Munster, IN as well as some local stores in the area from time to time. 3 Floyds distribution footprint is quite small, with their primary distribution in Indiana and limited distribution in IL, WI, OH, and KY.
Bottle is dated 2/18. At the time of this review the beer is only 3 days old. Poured into a 3 Floyds Teku glass.
Appearance: Slightly cloudy, orange amber in color
Smell: Floral citrus, mango, grapefruit, orange rind, and a hint of tangerine 
Taste: Grapefruit, floral hops, with a tropical fruits sweetness, and a slight malty finish
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, very smooth and crisp
Overall: This is one of the best APA’s I have ever had the privilege of enjoying. It is extremely smooth and quaffable for an APA, though this beer does lean more towards an IPA in both ABV and hoppiness. In my opinion the only APA’s that rival the flavor and complexity, while still maintaining an amazing drinkability are beers from Hill Farmstead out of Vermont.

One of the most appropriate sipping beers. Slightly better on draft but pretty damn good in the bottle as well. A beautiful golden color, with aromas of blended hops and citrus notes. Other reviews have stated that it isnt as good since the discontinuation of the citra hops, but I disagree. Im not really sure what FFFs secret is, but they have nailed it! 461 charactersIrishMedic, Feb 10, 2014

Poured out a beautiful light amber color, with a just off white head that left great lacings. Smell was really fruity and made me salivate for it hitting my mouth, which it did shortly.
Things got even better from there. Great fruit flavor, lot of grapefruit, with just a tiny bit of malt to hold things steady. Enjoyed every last drop, shout out to Tim S for including it in a gift bundle.
Will definitely seek this out again. Maybe an excuse to make it down for dark lord day...as if any were needed ! 551 charactersarthuro11, Feb 09, 2014

Thin white head, which dissipated to thin collar and lots of tiny bubbles. Excellent sticky lacing throughout, all the way down. Beautiful nose of floral citrus and mango grapefruit. On the palate, the nose is replicated, but a dank piney hint emerges. Great malts, good balance. Big chewy mouthfeel. Nice long finish. Reminds me of cross b/t Sucks & Hopslam, which sounds like the definition of heaven to me. 524 charactersJohnParadee, Feb 09, 2014

Appearance:
Dark golden, very little head.
Smell:
Wow. Pine trees, just amazing. They should make an air freshener scent from this beer.
Taste:
Piney hops, lingering bitterness but very pleasant.
Mouthfeel:
Big carbonation which suits the bitterness perfectly.
Overall:
Not overrated in my opinion. First pale ale that I have found which compares favorably to Hill Farmstead Edward which is my gold standard. Lucky to have Osiris and ZD back to back while in Indy. 526 charactersNewport_beerguy, Feb 08, 2014

I scored it a little lower on the mouthfeel because of this, but still great brew. Solid malt/hop balance, but went down a little rough.

I love the smell. Citrus and floral with some bread.
A very rich pleasing taste with excellent smoothness. Light on the after taste, which my pallet was begging for a longer experience.
I like it, no question about it. Most of all its smoothness, one can tell this is a brew brewed with loving care. But to be honest I dont know what the hublaa is about and why its worth its weight in Gold. Im not about to drive 60 miles to buy a case thats for sure but I would regular have it in my bag of tricks if it was easily available.
Its a very nice experience. I bet it would be a winner with food. Like some aged beef. 836 charactersUSAF77, Jan 30, 2014

Among the 12 brews tasted was; Zombie Dust American Pale Ale from Three Floyds. Although
not a high alcohol beer, I had just bought it because it was rated number 6 on the BA site with
a BA score of 100. Sad to say this beer was a total disappointment finishing 10th with an average
rating of 3.75. It is possible that something was wrong with this bottle as it had no head to speak
of at all. I have another one to try, so hopefully it will live up to the reviews of other reviewers.
Well I tried the second bottle and still do not understand how Zombie Dust got the rave reviews. But this bottle did have a little more appeal than the first one, but not enough to change my rating.
I have been spoiled by two really outstanding IPA's here in Vermont; Alchemist's Heady Topper which is currently at number 1 on the BA site, and Lawson's Finest Liquids Double Sunshine, which
is currently at number 10 on the BA site. However I feel Double Sunshine should be number 1 and
Heady Topper number 2. 1,090 charactersricknelson, Jan 27, 2014

Look: Look is honestly kind of boring, golden red hue, good head retention, light and fluffy.
Smell: Is there a pale ale that smells better? Bread, fresh hops, Citrus. Citrus is general. Grapefruit, orange peel, pineapple. Perfection. 
Taste: Hops, citrus, supported by a gentle background of malt. 
Feel: Between foamy and bubbly. Perfect for a pale ale, tickles the tongue while allowing for awesome smells. Not too thick and definitely not too thin.
Overall: Perfect balance. FFF makes it look easy, you almost wonder why nobody else can make a beer quite like this. I challenge all of the critics of zombie dust to try on e next to any "Zombie killer". This makes IPAs much too sweet and syrupy and Pale ales much too weak. 898 charactersWKyle, Jan 27, 2014

Pours a hazy orange with a quarter inch of white head, dissipates to a lacing. 
Smells of honey, fresh piney grapefruit hops, and a bit of tangerine. 
Tangerine and grapefruit citrus flavor, mildly hoppy, with some honey sweetness and a bit of pine and grassy malt underneath. Some mango and passionfruit in the aftertaste. The hops are exceptionally citrusy and fresh. 
Medium body with tingly carbonation on the tongue.
A very good pale ale, nice body and aroma, with a truly exceptional flavor. This is maybe the best hop balance of flavor I've ever had in a beer. There is nothing else like it. This is a real treat and worth seeking out. 654 charactersCylinsier, Jan 26, 2014

Citra hop aroma right off the bat, but it's not overpowering. Ruby red grapefruit and/or mandarin orange, with an earthy backbone of dank green hop aroma, as well. Lemon, straw, and maybe a tiny bit of caramel malt in the background.
Taste follows the nose: slightly dank, with citrus fruit. Balanced and complex. Mango and biscuit. Citrus peel aftertaste. Floral/honey notes try to sneak in every now and then before being washed away by citrus.
Very lively, with a pleasant sting. Very dry and effervescent finish.
ZD didn't blow my mind, but the hype is well-deserved - as is the APA designator. It's a bright, super hoppy beer that reminds me of Hill Farmstead with its balance and complexity. Flavor profile is reminiscent of some of the biggest DIPAs out there, but it's so much lighter and easy to drink.

I got this as an extra and I can understand the hype. I'm gulping this down way too easily.
I hope I can get more. 326 charactersraynmoon, Jan 24, 2014

S- Smells fantastic. Oranges and citric juicy aromas burst out of this one.
T - some English tasting, bready malts are faintly evident, but the thing that really stands out is the huge citric, juicy, grapefruit flavor.
M - this is a really drinkable, refreshing APA.
O - Fantastic beer. One of the best in the world in my opinion 457 charactersDVoors, Jan 24, 2014
4.74/5  rDev +4.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 12oz bottle
A- Warm, golden orange with a thick white foamy head
S- A very crisp, clean citrus hop smell. Soft, not overpowering
T- A wonderfully balanced citrus hoppy flavor (from the citra hops). Floral undertones and nice delicate sweetness. Almost no bitterness
M- Nicely carbonated yet a bit on the thin side. Would like it have a bit more body 
O- An amazingly smooth and drinkable pale ale. While not as flavorful as some top tier IPAs or other Citra hop beers, Zombie Dust might be the most balanced and smoothest. The slight sweetness and lack of bitterness make this one of the few hoppy beers that I could drink all night. 652 charactersBartos, Jan 24, 2014

Served: 20 Jan 2014
Appearance: Hazy golden-orange color with a pearly white head that collapses pretty quick. Marvelous lacing on the sides of the snifter as the beer is consumed.
Smell: Marvelously clean, with citrusy hop notes. Some sweetness can be smelled.
Taste: Wow, I now understand the hype about this beer- though it is definitely really hoppy, the beer has a great, sweet maltiness to it too, allowing for the beer to be hoppy but not oppressively bitter. Grapefruit and pine notes overlaying a sweet malt backbone. Excellent.
Mouthfeel: Great carbonation makes this one extraordinarily refreshing.
Overall: The only problem with this beer was that it was in 12oz. I could drink pints on pints of this stuff without thinking twice. Definitely in a grey area between an APA and IPA though. I don't like this one in the APA category because of its hoppiness, but it doesn't belong in the IPA category because of its maltiness. Must try. An incredible beer. 1,000 charactersBeric, Jan 23, 2014

Smells of honey, hop resins, and tropical fruits. 
Highly complex flavors. Tropical fruits such as pineapple, grapefruit and lemon rinds, apricots, and a slight hint of honey. Perfectly balanced malt backbone. Not too sweet, and dangerously drinkable. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied yet crisp. Hop oils leave a bit of a slick on the tongue. 
Overall a stunning beer. I could drink this all day and night. Leans more toward an IPA in my opinion, but who really cares about the classification. It's an amazing brew regardless of what you call it. wish I could get this stuff on a regular basis! 704 charactersIeatlambfries, Jan 20, 2014

Pours into an imperial pint glass, forming a 1/2" light beige head over the cloudy dark golden amber brew. Head recedes slowly, with leggy lasting lace. Aroma is juicy citrus. 
Taste starts malty, tangerine and citrus in the middle, and closes bitter yet somewhat balanced. Mouthfeel is wow smooth, and drinkability is amazing. Will be on the lookout for again. 442 charactersppoitras, Jan 20, 2014

Pours a hazy burnt orange with a two finger creamy white head
Smells of grapefruit and tangerines
Though not overly carbonated it is very effervescent as it spreads it hoppy joy across the pallet.
It almost hints at it being a dry hopped wheat ale but lacking that bready aftertaste, finishes clean but the hops hang on to your tongue for dear life. 
Lacing is great as you can recall each sip by its mark on the glass.
A very creamy yet light mouthfeel.
I know this beer is hard to find outside of NW Indiana but if there were any reason to cross state lines for a beer this is it. 724 charactersLANDRY, Jan 19, 2014

Three Floyds Zombie Dust is a 60 IBU Pale Ale that pours a deep amber, also has a very hazy deep orange hue~ Aromas of Pine forest smack your nostril instantly... Like a citrus fruit stand in the middle of a Pine forest, Yeast and Hops present as well~ Mouthful is light, creamy and refreshing, much less sticky than anticipated for a 6.4% low carbination~ Taste is crisp and clean, Citrus right away... Orange Grapefruit, Mango, Passion Fruit, Lemon Zest and Pineapple... All of which are balanced to near perfection with Carmel malt, Honey and a Bready Backbone~ Zombie Dust is not complex, her strengthens are a ridiculously refreshing, well balanced sleek and smoothness that delivers on point and shines while doing so~ How Three Floyd's pulls off their brew being light, refreshing smooth and subtle WHILE also being Big, Hearty, Satisfying, Bold 'Meaty' and Tasty is beyond me! However, they rock each one seamlessly... Cheers to 3Floyds ! A bit of a dank yet funky (soapy) aftertaste is the only MINASCULE Drawback~ 1,104 charactersClePaul, Jan 18, 2014

Pours a cloudy orange tan with a slight head that quickly turns to a thick off white lacing that lasts throughout the ale. The nose is deep and malty. Sweet but not bitter with the hoppiness normally found in a pale ale. There is pine and grass notes but not much citrus on the nose. It Sips clean with a pleasant mouth coating effect. Not bitter but not sweet either. Rather balanced and very pleasant. The tongue is malty and rich with a tangy bitterness on the start and an unexpected sweetness on the finish. The balanced flavor lasts long after the ale is gone. The flavors of this ale are astoundingly balanced, almost too much so. It is an incredibly well crafted ale but lacks any notes that make it stand out from the rest. It is a delicious ale that is incredibly satisfying but, even with all the hype, not one that I would go out of my way for again. 959 characterslochef81, Jan 17, 2014

Appearance - Golden straw yellow with a nice 1 inch foamy head, lots of sticky lacing.
Smell - Strong oily hops, herbal, very dank, weedy. Oranges, lemons, grapefruit. Some wheat and pale malts come out in the finish.
Taste - Starts out with a very smooth hop bite that is citric and smooth. Has a real thick, oily, resin hop flavor in each sip. Very herbal, grassy with a nice amount of caramel malts and pale malts. 
Mouthfeel - Smooth, citric hops coats the tongue along with some malts and sugars. Palate gets nice oily resin from the hops. Aftertaste is light, tropical fruity and mildy malty.
Overall - A beer that lives up to the hype. So smooth, tasty and easy to drink. Packs quite a hop punch for being a pale ale, but the hops arent super bitter so its not going to crush your palate. World class yes, and unique, i cant compair it to any other beer ive ever had. 901 characterswvsabbath, Jan 05, 2014

End of the pour reveals some yeasty critters ready to excite my palate. Finger of sudsy head. Descent retention and some sticky lace spots. Lots of bubbles on the side of the glass.
Bright, fresh aroma of piney, citric and herbal hops with apricot. Hint of baby powder.
Lighter bready malt character, slight butter flavor. Aggressive hop presence of sap-drenched pine needles, fresh cut grass, grapefruit and apricot. Nectar like sweetness. Nice balance here.
Just barely medium bodied. Well carbonated. Smooth mid-drink with a semi-dry, crisp finish. Not a lot of yeast texture.
One of the better pale ales I have had and closer to an IPA in my opinion. I'd really like to try this on tap. 777 charactersbnes09, Dec 30, 2013

S- An amazing citrus infused smell. 
T- A citrus combination that really took me by surprise, in a good way.
M- I immediately noticed the carbonation. The alcohol was also contained nicely could definitely have killed the six pack that I luckily got my hands on.
Overall, it lived up to the hype was an absolute phenomenal beer. I would highly recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on it. Will actually be getting my hands on some permanent funeral within the next week! 564 charactersBeer_Sherman, Dec 28, 2013

M- Mouthfeel is great, nice carbonation nice full feel.
Had on draft like 3 nights in a row, each time just blew me away. First time I had it in a bottle it was pretty good probably not worth the hype... But having it on draft just blew me away I had to re-review it. I've never had a better beer than Zombie Dust on tap, and I say that in full confidence. 474 charactersWadeBridgman, Dec 28, 2013
4.58/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Really an awesome and unique pale ale. Poured from a 12 oz into a pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a finger of head, modest retention and decent rings of lacing.
Smell is delightful- some lemon, a little sticky resin but just the right amount and a nice clean grain scent.
Tastes fantastic; I would expect nothing less of a pale ale from three Floyd's. Still that lemon citrus hop characteristic and the same slightly resinous quality but also an unusual flavor that's really familiar but that I dont associate with beer. It's an umami flavor, rich, kinda buttery but not in a gross way at all. Excellent.
Mouthfeel is great too- medium light body, well carbonated but not prickly, not too sticky. Of course this is an awesome beer; wish I'd picked up a few more bottles. 800 charactersHopdaemon39, Dec 28, 2013

On tap at Sergio's in Louisville. Had two in a tulip. Quite special. 
As soon as it's poured the room smells like fresh hay and grapefruit - amazing!
Easily the best pale ale I've consumed. Fresh, crisp, bitter, and fantastic. Completely wrecks your palate though. I tasted a dopplebock after having one and it barely registered. 347 charactersredman84, Dec 26, 2013

Pours a deep amber semi translucent liquid with dark orange tints, a heavy 4-5 fingers tall and slight offwhite head formed, very frothy, the foam is thick and rocky in appeareance with strong persistance, small sized bubbles, heavy beautiful belgian laceing left behind.
Aroma is composed of a citric zest blend that tings my nose, green lemon rind, sweet orange, pinapple juice, lemongrass, and pale malty sweetness. the more i smell it the more i like it.
Taste- same as aroma, a very citrusy blend, green lemon rind amongst others, and a well rounded sweetness, bitterness is medium strenght with little persistance, mild aftertaste guava/pineapple like and a refreshing cold sensation is left in throat. 
Mouthfeel- Intensely carbonated, medium-light body, alcohol well hidden.
Overall an intensely hopped pale ale, bitterness is not that prominent, but the aroma and taste is all about the citra hops. they are nicely showcased in this brew. 1,006 charactersKingSlayer, Dec 24, 2013

A- Aggressive pour into at tulip glass resulted in a thick, ivory head with pretty good retention. Lacing on the glass as it dies. Wonderful golden orange color.
S- Sweet, juicy fruits. Floral notes. Ctirus fruits. Very, very faint pine. Lovely bouqet on this beer. Excellent balance and very smooth
T- Follows the nose quite well, though not as good. Still, thoroughly enjoyable. Same juicy fruits. Dry on the finish. Hop bitterness is the caboose to the juicy citrus flavors. Best pale ale I've tasted to date.
M- Light mouthfeel with a pretty good amount of carbonation. As mentioned above, very dry on the finish. Hop oils linger after quaffing. 
I enjoyed getting dusted. Gonna have to trade for some more soon. A phenomenal representation of the style. CONSUME FRESH. 843 charactersjbwimer, Dec 22, 2013

S - Possibly the best smelling hoppy beer I've had. (Including Pliny and several other world class beers) Serious amounts of hop aroma, both citrus and pine. Nice malty finish. Sweet and super appealing to the nostrils. 
T - Taste fell ever so slightly below smell, but still near perfect.
M - Again, a little less carbonation than I thought it should have, but could be my glass, pour, or temp effecting it. 
O - So glad to have a beer this fantastic in the Midwest. Russian River may make the best IIPA, but this APA is a very serious competitor for greatness. I hope to have plenty of this beer on hand for the Zombie Apocalypse... Prost! 772 charactersBowers-Brew, Dec 13, 2013
4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've had this beer several times before and decided to review after a great trade with WCW. 
Appearance - Looks great for a pale, very inviting
Smell - To be honest I don't waste time smelling this beer I go straight for the kill! (I'm sure it's quite nice)
Taste - Fantastic burst of citrusy flavours balanced with a resonating pine undertone. Juicy grapefruit all over my mouth. Great hop flavour for a pale
Mouthfeel - The nature of the style is so light on the palette and it really lends to the robust hop flavour you get.
Overall - I'm not sure what else you could ask for in a beer, let alone a pale ale for that matter. Considering the huge hype surrounding this beer, it delivers in every way possible. Outstanding. 729 charactersalucardswordlol, Dec 13, 2013

Smell: Citra hop fruit profile jumps out right away. Tropical fruits of mangos, pineapple, kiwi, tangerines, and orange peel. A nutty malt profile with accents of caramel and light oak as well. 
Taste: Pleasant malty front filled with peanuts, caramel, slight molasses, and oak. Hop body comes shortly after providing a bright, sweet hop profile with Citra accents all over it. Some light hop bitterness mixes well with fruity and malt tones. Oranges, lemon, lime, kiwi, and pineapple dance on the palate for a long time after drinking. 
Mouthfeel: Incredibly drinkable, smooth malt mixes very well with the hoppiness of this brew. 
Overall: This is a great brew but I don't think it is world class. I've had it a few times, on draft and in bottle to make sure I wasn't missing anything before I reviewed it. No doubt that is beer is a must try though, really enjoyed the six pack I was able to get. 1,110 charactersKFBR392, Nov 26, 2013

A: Pours a nice translucent orange with a slight haze. About 1 finger of white head that leaves a real nice lacing.
S: Wow!! Amazing. Big citrus aroma. Orange, mango, grapefruit. One of the best smelling beers.
T: Slight bitterness upfront leads straight into what the nose promised. Big citrus fruit. All the big aroma players come through in the taste. There is also a nice bread like quality in there that complements the big fruit profile. Finishes slightly dry and a nice fruit and bitterness end.
M: Medium bodied. Great carbonation. The dry-ish finish leaves you wanting that next sip.
O: Amazing. Simply the best APA. Seek this one out. Thanks again bcm75. 704 characterspimpinmidget, Nov 26, 2013

Nice rings down the glass. Citus and hoppy but not over the top

Body is no better than medium...definitely drinks like a pale ale....
Really a nice beer....not as assertive with the hops as Toppling Goliath Psuedo Sue but sometimes a little more subtle is fine too....I prefer Sue but per style ZD might win out as Sue really comes off as an IPA to me where this is clearly an APA with a lot of flavor.. 527 charactersZAP, Nov 23, 2013

M: Equal carbonation to the body of the beer, very easy to pound down, left that super craving dry pale ale taste in your mouth.
O: Easily one of the best beers I've had, I'm upset the liquor store wouldn't sell me more because of some stupid rule!!! I've been searching everywhere and is usually the first beer i look for. 628 charactersDV13710, Nov 18, 2013

I honestly would rather drink this beer over Heady Topper. It is a beer you can have a couple of without being trashed. However this beer more then any other beer I have ever had has to be fresh. It falls off quicker then anything in the world. But when fresh the nose is second to none. The flavor as well. 403 charactersvinny21bal, Nov 17, 2013

Smell: Amazing. Simply amazing. A blast of fresh, ripe grapefruit followed by tropical fruit notes. Someone make a cologne out of this! 
Taste: I am always hesitant to say a beer is perfect in ANY category, but this earns the distinction. Citrusy grapefruit, sweet tropical fruits and a crisp, bitter finish to refresh the palate. I could drink this forever. 
Mouthfeel: Well carbonated and full bodied, but not so much as to become thick or ruin the refreshing quality. 
Overall: An amazing beer. One of, if not THE best I've ever had. Full of flavor, spectacular aroma, this has everything a human could want. Now if you'll excuse me I'm off to the takeout room to procure several 6 packs. 859 charactersHammer35, Nov 12, 2013

4.77/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A - Slightly cloudy golden orange, with a full, pillowy head of off-white. The head fades slowly, and lacing is extensive and persistent.
S - A big, fat blast of hop power, with citrus rind and grass out front, pine and resin underneath, with a wildness that ranges around.
T - Following the nose, but with a malt complement that highlights the wonderful peach elements and offers sweetness.  There is a quick, cascading turn, a smack of citrus, mostly grapefruit. Coming in next is a tart and bitter snap, that closes with a chewy, pith-heavy bitterness.
M - A light drink with decent carbonation, but the chewiness of the hop oils does build.  If I ever had more than one Zombie Dust, I might still stop with one.
O - I cannot think of another beer quite like Zombie Dust. It may be an APA, and its light feel going down emphasizes this, but its clear hop focus and robust fruit and bitter has more in common with IPAs than with the typical APAs I've enjoyed.  I find Zombie Dust to be a pleasure, and I love the full frontal attack of the fruit and pine that is at this beer's core.  It drops off quickly, so don't leave this one sitting around for long, drink it up and enjoy. 1,184 charactersTsar_Riga, Nov 09, 2013

Pineapple, mango, and tangerines explode over a resinous body.

Overall, just an outstanding beer. I docked the overall however since the abundance of hops doesn't fit the APA style. Call it an IPA and I'll change my score. 437 characterslarryarms847, Nov 03, 2013

Deep orange with a thin white head that quickly settles into a ring around the glass. bright hop notes on the nose. Citrus ring and tangy grapefruit with a little sweet tangerine.

The appearance was very good on this beer... beautiful color... nice thick head with great retention and good lacing.
Smell was out of this world.... huge on citrus, grapefruit pineapple.. orange.. slight hops...and just an overall fresh smell.
The taste was outstanding as well.. taste followed the nose but the overall piney/bitterness to it is welcome and something that wasn't too heavy in the smell...
Medium to light bodied which is not overly carbonated on the back end... 
The biggest surprise was the bitter (almost needle like) alchol bite the hops had on the finish.. ohhh sooo good.. lingered just enough for you to want more..
Overall this is a fantastic APA... more of an IPA to me...but who am I? One I would chose over "almost" any other APA 856 characterspjkelley82, Oct 30, 2013

S - Lots of grapefruit! Some mango, some tangerine, just overall really tropical fruit-y overall. 
T - Follows the nose. A ton of grapefruit and a pretty large amount of tropical fruit. A little bit of piney bitterness. Definitely very tasty! 
M - On the lighter side of medium-bodied. Not quite as carbonated as I expected. Just a little bit of oiliness that built up throughout the beer, which almost reminded me a little of the texture of grapefruit juice.
O - Very good! The tropical fruit and grapefruit notes were really enjoyable, and the scent was really just fantastic! 711 characterskatalijne, Oct 24, 2013
4.48/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Night Shift tulip. Huge, huge thanks to my friend Bobby for giving me this massive want of mine.
Pours a cloudy amber-orange with a lovely two-finger head eggshell-white head. Good head retention--maybe 4 minutes or so--before it gradually subsides to a thin ring of suds around the edge of the glass. Plentiful and sticky lacing, albeit fairly wispy.
On the nose...welp, this is definitely a Citra beer. Potent grapefruit leads the charge out of the glass, with only slightly subtler notes of orange, mango, and papaya not far behind. Some onion and cat piss dankness poke through the tropical fruit and citrus bombardment. Truly a phenomenal-smelling beer.
Taste largely follows the smell, and is equally delicious. Massive grapefruit on the front of the palate gives way to a veritable explosion of tropical fruit mid-palate. Mango, papaya, passionfruit, even some strawberry...it's all there. Sweet earthy malts mingle pleasantly to remind you that despite all appearances to the contrary, this is not quite an IPA. A touch of racey piney bitterness on the back of the palate mingles with lingering sweet fruitiness and subtle vegetal hop notes.
Mouthfeel was interesting in that it felt a bit thin on the front of the palate, then a bit thick and oily on the back. A good level of carbonation keeps the beer from feeling too watery on the front of the palate, though, while it similarly prevented the back from becoming too sticky. 
On the whole, while I contest ZD's classification as a pale ale and not an IPA, there is no doubt in my mind that it is phenomenal regardless of style. A truly delicious beer that I will be actively seeking out more of. 1,696 charactersLjudsignal, Oct 24, 2013

I'm normally not a stickler for IPA freshness, but for some reason, this beer needs to be consumed within about a month of it's bottling date, or it just falls off a cliff.  When it's fresh though, it's one of the best representations of the style on the world.  Bitter, yet floral.  Fruity, but still piney.  It's a glorious beer. 386 charactersprior2two, Oct 22, 2013

A: Looks pretty good: slightly cloudy orange....very thick white head that has good retention.
S: Definitely the strongest aspect of this beer. The nose just has an amazing tropical bouquet of grapefruit, orange, mango and passionfruit that just invites you to take a drink. This is one of the best smelling beers of all time. 
T: Taste follows the nose closely. Loads of tropical fruit. You also get a bit of the floral and dankness from the hops, too...really nice. There's a bit of bready malt support throughout, but this is really a hop-loaded APA...pushes the boundaries of the APA/IPA line. 
M: This is a bit too thick, in my opinion....I think a bit lighter on the palate and it would be perfect. Really FEELS like a strong IPA in this aspect.
O: Obvious top-tier APA. The hop bouquet is amazing, the nose is better than pretty much any other APA (and most IPAs/DIPAs I've had.) The only criticism (if any) is with the thick mouthfeel. 
But seriously...this beer is as close to perfection as you can get with an APA. 1,068 charactersTTAmod, Oct 22, 2013

A - Pours amber with a slight ruby hue. Shows a slightly hazy straight up amber when shown to light. 1" head appeared which stuck around for a while. A fair amount of lacing stuck to the glass. Very small amount of carbonation visible. Possibly not the freshest batch.
S - Strong and unique. Lot's and LOT's of both fruity and bitter hops up front. Definitely a good amount of Citra and Cascade, as the the citrus is there, and to a higher extent, the grapefruit. Also a very faint hint of mango and strawberry. Some cat piss dankness in there too. Outstanding smelling beer.
T - Like the aroma, very unique. Certainly hoppy enough to be an IPA, but it's almost perfectly blended with the malts, which makes it outstandingly smooth. The fruitiness of the hops is there. Lot's of grapefruit and citrus. SNPA on steroids! The grapefruit is there is huge amounts, as is some floral bitterness. Slightly sweet malts can be noted in the aftertase, as can a bit of hoppy dankness. Great tasting beer.
F - Refreshing and easy on the stomach. Though I couldn't note much in it's appearance, there's a good amount of carbonation while on the tongue. No dryness or stickyness. This beer is easy to drink and is certainly sessionable.
O - An outstanding pale ale. The aroma is unreal, and the taste is almost as good. This could be an almost perfect beer, except there's something slightly sweet in the aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on, but I'm not a huge fan of. Still though, an outstanding pale ale, is sessionable, yet still has of great taste and feel. Every time I have one of these, I appreciate it more. That IMO, is a mark of a truly outstanding beer! 1,736 charactersstella77artois, Oct 20, 2013

The aroma was very pine and citrus hop forward, without a noticeable malt presence. On the tongue though, there was a delicate malt taste, more earthy/grassy than sweet, and was a full on hop assault. Pine in the front and citrus across the middle and back.
The biggest complaint is the thinness of the body. There wasn't much substance across the tongue, but the beer was very clean and had a dry finish. Drinkability was excellent, my lone 12oz bottle was gone far too quickly, and I will seek out more for further exploration. Overall, a very fine brew. A bit more body and this beer would be nearly perfect. A must try if you ever get the chance. 845 charactersbeertunes, Oct 17, 2013

S - Big citrus (grapefruit and orange) with a fresh hop scent.
T - Just like the smell. Big citrus hits you first. Malty sweetness comes next, followed by a beautiful hop bitterness. Drinks more like an IPA than a pale ale.
M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Very smooth on the tongue. Big juicy favors.

A - Sun kissed hazy orange with a white 2 finger head. Retention is nice and fades into a thin ring. Ghost trails of lacing coat my glass. 
S - No doubt that this is Citra hopped. Big tropical and citrus notes fume from the glass. Sweet mango, pineapple, and grapefruit are the front runners. Light malts give it a subtle sweetness. 
T - Incredible taste as I expected and it follows the nose. The mango and pineapple shine, but there is a good kick of grapefruit. The malts are light and act as a backdrop for the Citra hops. 
M - Nice light medium body that is spot on for carbonation. Not too sticky and not too oily, just right. 
O - I have had the luxury to have both PseudoSue and Zombie Dust very fresh. They both are world class APA's and I honestly don't know which is better, nor do I care. SO glad I finally got to try this. Well worth trading for IMO. 937 charactersRi0, Oct 17, 2013

Fine bubbles that slowly receeded over the course of 2mins, leaving behind chunky, spoty lacing on the edge and a quarter inch of thick foam on top that sticks with you most of the beer. The liquid is a hazy copper with some yellowish tints coming through the edge. Lots of tiny bubbles climbing up the side of the glass from the bottom.
S: Big and bright mango aroma that doesn't dull after the foam falls. Tropical melon and berries with a nice background of citrus and pine hop aroma, very candy like. A noticable but subdued breadcrust malt aroma that takes a backseat to all the hop aroma on this beast.
T: Firm tropical fruit, mango candy bitterness that carries you to a more flavorful resinous hop flavor of similar flavor. There are lots of layers from begining to end (to aroma) that carry the beer to a tropical nirvana in your mouth. The balance is strongly on the bitterness side but there is a malt backbone to carry it without being to over powering. toast and bread crust are the flavors im getting. Clean, neutral fermentation and no off flavors to speak off.
M: A creamy mouth texture with nice moderate carbonation and lower body. There is a lingering creamy reisinous hop oil texture that makes you feel like you should go for another sip before it fades.
O: I've had the beer at GABF, at the brew pub and out of a bottle all have lived up to the hype but I've got to say getting it from the brewpub is my preferense. An amazingly flavorful, aromatic, tropical punch in the face. You know what your getting here 1,592 charactersguityler83, Oct 10, 2013

A - Beautiful copper body with a chunky, towering, neon white cap of foam. Outstanding retention and lace.
S - Bright, fresh hop cone nose. Extraordinarily fresh and light. Thyme, hint of bitter rose water, wild flowers, touch of lemon zest, dried grass. 
T - Outstandingly fresh herbal and mildly citrus hops load onto your palate and finish with a light bitter backend. Just a touch of clean malt sweetness helps frame the hop profile and does an great job of staying out of the way, letting the quality of the hop character really shine.
M - Medium-light frame is perfect for the style. Nice carbonation.
O - While not necessarily the best beer I've ever had, Zombie Dust is hands down the best pale ale I've had the pleasure of trying. This beer is a near perfect balance of fresh hop cone flavor, restrained malt sweetness, and balanced alpha oil bitterness that makes a pale ale a pale ale and not an IPA. 945 charactersvfgccp, Oct 08, 2013

Poured into a tulip glass on a sunny day in summer.
Appearance: Very vibrant orange hue with a white head which dissipates quickly leaving a white ring around the top of the glass. Incredibly clear with no sediment in the glass. 
Smell: This is where the beer entices you. Smells of grapefruit, passion fruit and citrus arise from the glass. You will want to savor the aroma since it is that good.
Taste: Slightly bitter but very smooth. The bright citrus flavors envelope the palate with a very balanced finish. This is an amazing pale ale. Hoppy almost to the point of an IPA but so drinkable. Unquestionable a benchmark for all pale ales to live up to.
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, very drinkable. Slight astringent bitterness from the citra hops but so artfully balanced with the malt on the finish. Makes you want to drink it again after your sip was just finished. 988 charactersAMG55, Oct 08, 2013

This is the perfect looking pint. Bright orange with a touch of haze, Enormous frothy, rocky head that completely covers the beer with a centimeter of head for the entire glass and drapes the glass in curtains and chunks of foam. Enormous, aromatic, orangey hops in the nose, with just a bit of cookie dough maltiness in the background. The taste bursts with orange, lemon, passionfruit, grapefruit mango and all sorts of other luscious flavors I can't describe. A very submissive doughy malt profile lays in the back. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy, silky carbonation level and some mouth numbing from the hop bitterness. Fruity hop notes linger in the moderately bitter finish.
This may be tied with Alpha King as my favorite Pale Ale. So hoppy and complex. Stupidly quaffable and approachable, rather than hit you over the head brash. A must try. 980 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Oct 05, 2013

Mostly clear gold with a small, richly creamy head. Big Citra aroma with some sugary malt, pineapple, orange oils, and grapefruit. Pungent fruit all around, mango, leafiness, all floral and zesty with an increasing "dankness". Juicy, fruity, oily hops in the mouth...big citrus, ripe fruit, pine needles, floral hops, and peaches. Crisp, medium bodied, and smooth, softening towards the end. Different from what I expected, but that's not a bad thing. I bet I could drink a lot of this if given the opportunity. 611 characterswedge, Oct 04, 2013

Very nice smooth and prickly mouthfeel. Quite swirlable and some kind of juicy explosion in the mouth. Stinkier hop presence as it warms up.

4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed thanks to the generosity of SammyJaxxxx out of a 12 oz brown bottle. No dating that I can locate. Poured into a 16 oz nonic style tumbler.
Appearance - An aggressive pour yields a finger and a half of soapy chiffon colored foam. It's sudsy and heavy looking and sits atop a glowing orange peel colored body. Slight haze from the chill and an amber shadow hovers beneath the head with spun gold highlights. Retention is great as the larger bubbles slowly burst and the center begins to sink, leaving light sheets of lacing on the sides of the glass that eventually fade to sparse residue.
Smell - Bright and aromatic with citrus notes of orange, tangelo, starfruit and even mango. I've head a lot about this functionally being an IPA, but the aroma lacks some of the pungency that I would expect from an IPA. As is, it just smells like a pale ale, but with an intoxicating complexity that doesn't overpower. After the citrus clears, you are left with pine and garden herbs, especially thyme or perhaps basil.
Taste - My first swig is hard to stop, it's so clean and bright. It reminds me of fruit juice, but with no sweetness other than a faint aftertaste of light biscuit and shortbread. Again, citrus is on full display, but without the mouth wallop that often comes with an IPA. As it warms, the initially faint bitter aftertaste becomes more pronounced, balancing well with the fruity citrus. Here the pine is still detectable, but more faint than in the aroma.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied and juicy, with carbonation on the light side of moderate. Slightly bitter finish.
Overall, a beer that came with a great deal hype, and one that comes about as close as something can come to living up to it's own massive reputation. I'm especially impressed at how they managed to get big hop flavor on display without turning this into a full-bore IPA flavor profile. It managed to have depth and yet still be light. If only it were easier to get... 1,955 charactersLambicPentameter, Oct 02, 2013

S - Lots of hops. Very citrusy aroma. It smells so clean and fresh. Unbelievable.
T - HOLY SH%T! A pale ale that has no taste of a lager lingering around. I can imagine myself drinking nothing but this beer for the rest of my days and I'm really ok with that. Sadly this will be my last one, at least for now.
M - Tastes clean and crisp. Lots of carbonation, which I love in hoppy ales. Very smooth and doesn't leave too much hop oil on the palette. 
O - Best pale ale of all time? Probably. Really glad my good friends hooked me up with this. One of the best beers I've had, and really glad it lived up to its reputation. I'm giving it a perfect review. If you don't like it, I hope a Zombie kills you. 935 charactersThePaleRider, Oct 01, 2013

M) Full and satisfying.
O) I'm not going to lie, this is probably my favorite beer in the world. So many brewers mask a beer's flaw with IBU's, but this is perfectly done and incredibly well crafted in every respect. This is a piece of brewing art. 525 charactersPenguinBeerFan, Sep 28, 2013

Pours a hazy yellow orange with fair sized white head with good retention.
Oh the smell. I ended up smelling the empty bottle after drinking this bad boy. Wish this was an air freshener scent. Huge mango, pineapple and orange, a little vanilla; followed by dankness.
The taste is fantastic just like the smell. For a pale ale this is pretty hoppy, but what did I expect with it coming from FFF. 
I think the mouthfeel is perfect here. Carbonation is spot on, and there is a fantastic creaminess I dont get with other pale ales. This is what sets it apart.
Overall, I am glad I have several more of these. I understand what all the hype is about and I just jumped on the bandwagon. 746 characterscfaulman, Sep 26, 2013

All kinda of citrus and a small amount of grass and pine. Only a little malt comes through, the hops are straight forward. The taste has good citrus qualities, as well. The malt cuts into the bitterness and is balanced nicely. Citrus, pine, and some other tropical fruit come through on the aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, small amount of carbonation and the taste lingers on the tongue for just a little bit, which makes you want to keep drinking this all day long. 585 charactersMikeypnh, Sep 26, 2013

Fresh from the brewery this was just a glorious blast of citra hops and wonderful hop taste. Even after nearly a month though the beer is still incredible and seems to legitimately get better with each drink.
The color is a little cloudy and hazy which knocks it just a peg down (ok a quarter peg) and although it smells wonderful I still prefer the aromas of Dreadnaught. 
Everything else this beer has though it truly extraordinary. This is the only beer that would be a double/imperial anything in my top ten of all time. This deserves all the praise it has gotten and if you think it's overrated just try another, and another and eventually you'll come around. Perhaps some day this will be as readily available as Alpha King or Gumball Head. 905 characterswpqx, Sep 25, 2013

Orange with a tight white head. Smells and tastes like a beery tangerine Orange Julius, a Tangerine Julius if you will. Or super concentrated freshly squeezed Citra juice. Mildly sweet caramel support.

You've all heard about the glorious zombie so I'll touch on the positive
s according to my palate. Clean, crisp citra bite, its really like its own fruit upon first nose and taste, then just before you are overwhelmed, it goes all savoy truffle.
Personally, I think it gets high marks not b/c of excellence in the genre, but rather great amongst all beer, standing alone. That said, I prefer Perm Fun and SSMF.

4.39/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance:
Poured into a tulip, this pale showcases a beautiful and opaque shade of orange. Topped by a thick, bone white head that is porous and quite creamy. Lacing is abundant and carbonation is minimal.
Aroma:
Heavenly. Up front you're greeted by a blast of earthy grasses and pine, followed by an encore of floral notes a plenty of citrus and tropical fruit. Pineapple, orange, tangerine, and mango amongst hints of kiwi, strawberry and even peach. It's a sweet, well orchestrated symphony of aromatic bliss.
Taste:
Initially quite dry, until the tropical fruit the nose detected rush in to save the day. Alcohol is very noticeable here, but it's not overbearing. Hops are present from beginning to end, but they are never over-power the subtle malts. Nicely balanced.
Mouthfeel:
A decent amount of carbonation is present in this light to medium-bodied pale. It's crisp and surprisingly refreshing. The finish is beautiful - it leads you to believe it will finish dry, but at the very last second, you're hit with refreshing hydration.
Overall:
This a fine example of the American Pale Ale style, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite styles. It's almost hoppy enough to pass for an IPA, but balanced enough to enjoy multiple in one sitting. Do yourself a favor and see what all the hype is about. 1,314 charactersalphagnome, Sep 12, 2013

4.79/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a dark orange color with a finger length white head. Dissipates quickly and leaves a nice lacing. Smells of intense, juicy, sweet fruits like pineapple, mango, grapefruit, some peach, tiny bit of floral notes, lots of tropical fruit, sweet carmel. Almost like a bubblegum smell. Taste starts a hefty dose of citrus, sweet, savory fruits like pineapple, mango, and peach, get some floral qualities as well. Very classic floyds taste. Then gets even sweeter with the carmel malts and more fruits. Then finishes with more citrus fruits, even more tropical fruits, more carmel. Nice dry finish. During the entire taste profile, a good amount of hop bitterness lingers. Somewhat bitter, but just so darn smooth, fruity, and refreshing and definitely not as intense as the aroma suggests. Mouthfeel is creamy. Medium body with a good amount of carbonation, which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. Have had it many times, and never ceases to amaze me. Best session beer on the market. 993 charactersbrewskis, Sep 07, 2013

I believe that everything about this ale is perfectly balanced, highlighting the uniqueness of Citra, and that Three Floyds has set the standard by which all beers brewed using Citra will be measured.
 The overall appearance regarding color and head are exactly as one might expect or should expect from an ale. It is the distinct aroma and taste of Citra hops, which again is a perfect balance with the grain and yeast, that takes Zombie Dust to another level. 561 charactersHOPPED, Sep 06, 2013

Nothing comes close to Zombie Dust. Nothing. I lucked out and got a case last year as I was heading East, but this time I was stuck only having it on tap.
It's a nearly-flawless beer, and nothing comes close. 5/5, every single time. 491 characterscoolkatz321, Sep 03, 2013

5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance - somewhat clouded peach-tinted golden color. Head is puffing up quickly to about a finger and a half. Holds some of the sediment from the bottom, like sprinkled cinnamon on a meringue. Steady action from below, keeping the head in good shape.
Aroma - piny and grapefruit combo, good resilience, mmm....
Taste - the citrus side of the hops hits immediately with the sturdy grain base, the balance is great right from the start. Moving to mid-palate, the grains subside and the hops go a little twangy, prickly on the tongue. Just about where they'd start to get a little medicinal, they begin to ease up instead. The finish stays mildly bitter but fills the mouth just the same. Grapefruit rind at the end.
Mouthfeel - quite smooth, very crisp, medium+ body.
Overall - excellent session pale. Thanks to my buddy Steve for picking up a few of these on his last trip to Munster. Enjoyed it during the WEBN 2013 fireworks, aptly zombie-themed this year. I really enjoyed this beer despite the hype. Too often, once I hear all the accolades, I find it hard to enjoy the beer afterwards - so much pressure! :-)

A: A full 2 fingers of soapy white head top a hazy golden amber ale. A few meandering bubbles of carbonation make a break for the top. 
S: Sweet pine resin mixed with notes of grapefruit pith. Floral notes up front of sweet flowers and tropical fruits, pineapple and mango and bitter orange. 
T: Orange bitters up front pop on the palette. Sweet malts follow and support the bitters with a malty profile. A solid pine resin is there but not overwhelming, like a balancing act of malts, pine resin and orange bitters. Sweet tropical fruit juice is also present, maybe mango or pineapple. 
M: A thicker mouth feel, nearly syrupy and coats the mouth well. Carbonation is medium with pin pricks that liven the tongue. 
O: Extremely well balanced without shying away from the big flavours. Enjoyed the combination of citrus, pine resin and tropical fruits with that backbone of malts. A highly drinkable and refreshing IPA that comes close to a DIPA. 1,007 charactersFondueVoodoo, Sep 03, 2013

I don't get a hold of this often, so I sometimes find myself almost disbelieving my memory of it. But I got a sixer the other night, poured myself one, took a sip, and thought: yep, just as good as you remembered. Then my wife took a sip. "That's amazing," she said. She took another: "That's the best beer in the world!" In my limited experience, I think she's right. 619 charactersQbdoo, Sep 01, 2013

Three Floyds
Zombie Dust sports a polished brass body with good clarity. Carbonation swims to the surface from all over the pint glass. A two finger, foamy white head forms on the pour that eventually becomes creamy and settles to a fat finger throughout the entire drink. Solid lacing is left up and down the glass.
Pungent citrusy and tropical hop notes explode from the glass along with a nice resinous bite. Clementines, pineapple, and papaya all have their place with that big resinous quality bringing up the rear in larger amounts as it warms. A mild cracker crust maltiness, that's barely discernable, allows the hop profile to shine. 
This is the freshest bottle of Zombie Dust I've ever had and the resinous hop quality is huge whereas the citrus/tropical character tends to dominate when a couple weeks old. Resinous up front with a gripping bitterness. The citrus kicks in midway through and leads throughout the swallow. Tropical notes linger after the swallow. Great beer!
Mouthfeel is spot on. Medium bodied with a light feel thanks to the moderate carbonation. There's a nice velvety body with gripping bitterness on the inside of the cheeks.
Zombie Dust is a beer I never get tired of. Every time I have one it continues to be exciting and delicious. I can't recommend this beer highly enough. It's been tough to find over the last 7 or 8 months though. I had to go to the brewery to pick this up and it was flying out of the door. 1,479 charactersjoe1510, Aug 31, 2013

Of these and two gumballheads straight from the brewery.
A - Pours a very carbonated golden, orange looking brew. Bubbles all over the glass racing up to a thick, large bubbly off white head. Settles slowly with good lines of lacing everywhere. 
S - Whoa citra!! Big citra hop blast in the nose. A bit of pine sapp, and pine needles. I pick up some caramel malt in here for the balance. 
T - Yea citra hops are definitely the strong point in here. But there's also a juicy mango fruit flavor in here like biting into the ripe pulp itself. Delicious. Hops are slightly bitter but still very fresh in this. And some piney sapp in the nose is here in flavor combined with some caramel malt.
M - Light bodied brew with tickling high carbonation. Sweetness mixed with hops effortlessly throughout the mouth, and ever so easy going down. Incredibly quaffable.
O - This beer deserves any praise that it gets. Honestly the best of the "pale ale" category excluding the "I" by miles. I would drink this all day and would probably eat someone's brains if it meant getting this beer sent to PA. 1,136 charactershaazer, Aug 28, 2013

Smell is of fresh pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, and other fresh citrus fruits. Nice malt backbone but not overpowering. One of the freshest smelling beers I've had. Truly amazing. Some alcohol presents itself as the beer warms a bit but this beer barely lasted long enough to warm. 
Taste is amazing. Fresh citrus as the beer hits my tongue. In the middle the hops begin to settle on your tongue. Just enough pine taste with some grapefruit. The finish is piney bright hops and a touch of alcohol. Very very good. 
Perfect, creamy carbonation. Light enough to drink a few but not watered down. Keeps the flavors alive in your mouth. 
This beer is perfect. Easily my favorite beer I've tried so far. Just phenomenal. 832 charactersdowen17, Aug 28, 2013

A: Pours a beautiful golden honey color with nearly white foamy head that dissipated fairly quickly to a thin ring around the edge. Some nice lacing.
S: The nose on this is insane. Nice citrus and floral hops. Smells like an orange, a grapefruit, and a pineapple had a baby.
T: Lots of citrus mixed with just the right amount of hops. Borders on the line between APA and IPA and the results are fantastic.

A- Pours a very nice light amber color, head is almost pure white. A healthy head forms which retains very well and laces the glass intensely as you drink the beer.
S- Smells very nice. Fresh hops, hints of malt, and fruity sweetness. Smells like a nicely hopped pale ale.
T- Very crisp and dry intially, smooth and refreshing. After a few seconds I start to pick up more of the malt profile with the aftertaste being primarily fresh hop flavor with citrus notes from the citra hop. Lemony pinapple flavor.
M- Pretty much spot on for the style. Maybe a little bit on the heavy side, but all other aspects are great. Nice complexity.
O- Overall this is a great APA, but really dances the line between an IPA and APA. Very drinkable and tasty, with amazing complexity. There isn't much you could do to make this beer better aside from getting them to me fresher!

A: Very orange, very cloudy with 2 fingers of offwhite head. Looks great.
S: This is one you can smell from a distance - very very fresh, extremely citrusy, juicy, and somewhat floral. 
T: Almost IPA, but with a bit more of a sweetness to it. Honey and citrus running together over a bit of bread. The taste is solid and strong but not at all overwhelming. When it hits your palate it explodes with flavor and then washes away clean. Super drinakable.
Overall a great beer as its reputation shows. Definitely not overrated. Huge huge flavor and character from an American Pale Ale. Not too in your face but with huge flavor. 691 charactersBucBasil, Aug 21, 2013

A: Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a half finger of cream-colored head, which quickly dissipates to a ring a mottled film. Spotty lacing is left down the glass.
S: Tons of citrusy hop-forward character and a little bit of a sweet malt giving off an almost cotton candy aroma. Plenty of grapefruit.
T/M: This hits the tongue with a little bit of citrusy zest and a crisp, well carbonated, medium mouthfeel. Citrusy hop character swells over the course of the sip, finishing lightly bitter with a nice citric note. Malt is sweet almost like candy, but not overwhelming... very good. Incredibly drinkable. The carbonation in this beer is prickly and at just the right level. Taste is full of citrusy hop character, but is never overwhelming.
O: A really great beer. Much like with Pliny the Elder as the pinnacle of its style, I am not overwhelmed by any one thing about this beer (excepting that the mouthfeel is absolutely perfect). It's just a very well crafted beer all around with no major flaws, and that goes a really long way. I would drink this very frequently if I had regular access to it. 1,189 charactersjdhowe, Aug 20, 2013

Light mouthfeel and excellent strong hop and citrus flavor doesn't have a lingering coppery taste that I've noticed in some ipa's or dipa's. hands down best ipa/pale ale I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. 314 charactersWrex68, Aug 18, 2013

This beer is worth the hype and should be at the very top of any list for any serious beer drinkers . Three Floyds never disappoints and this shows it masterfully.
 Try it if you have the chance. 297 charactersedhizdeid, Aug 18, 2013
4.85/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a slightly hazy amber with billowy off-white head that dissipates quickly. Good lacing. It looks like a world class ale in the glass. The nose is all hops. Intense tropical fruit aromas with a whiff of grass and lemon. Bitterness at the front of the palate gives way to a malty middle that finishes with a floral, lemony hoppiness. Light bodied with great carbonation make this a very refreshing pale. Overall this a well crafted pale, complexity to rival the best DIPAs on BA with an ABV low enough to make it just about sessionable, a most impressive achievement. Thanks Xthul! 585 charactersJohnG190, Aug 17, 2013
5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Hazy reddish orange color with a nice 2" just off white head tons of lacing. The soft foam fills above the rim of the glass and leaves a small crater
S - Tropical fruits, grapefruit, just smells so juicy! Nice citra hop aroma
T - I like how they use the word "gushing" in the description of this beer, because that is exactly what I think of when trying to describe the taste. It is loaded with citra hop but its so well balanced it does not leave any unpleasantness at all. 
M - Refreshing, but full of flavor, not too much alcohol, probably the perfect amount for an IPA / APA in my opinion. 
Label art is probably the coolest out there. Like a page from a comic book, except shiny metallic! Since I live roughly an hour from the brewery, this is frequently stocked at my house. I just love this beer. I know perfect scores should be very hard to come by, but this beer is what changed my outlook on beer forever. I have read by some that this beer is overrated, but it is truly the best single IPA i have ever had, and what is even more amazing is that I can get it regularly. Thank you 3F! 1,101 charactersChibeerguy1, Aug 17, 2013

Pours a hazed, dull tone of medium amber. Staying khaki cap, frothy and on the looser side. Leaves low sheeting, blobs and strands of lace. 
Yummy tropical fruit nose, with ripe melon and mango.
Fine quality and great testing brew from FFF. Tropical fruit notes continue all the way to the finish. Smooth and so flavorful. Hops hops and more hops but they are not overly bitter or resinous. Fruity and again tropical notes come to mind. 
World class APA, glad to have been able to enjoy a few pints of this on tap at the brewery with dinner and then walk away with a case to bring home. 672 charactersBillolick, Aug 14, 2013

A: Pours a glowing burnt golden color with about a finger of greasy off-white head. Head quickly faded into a bubbly film that left a few spots of soapy lace down the glass. 
S: Huge juicy and fresh notes of grapefruit juice and tropical fruits. Sweet smelling, fragrant, and juicy. Faint bready pale malt in the background. 
T: Follows the nose with juicy tropical fruit nectar and grapefruit citrus rind. Sweet and juicy overall but very clean and refreshing. The finish contains hints of pale malt and the aftertaste is full of bitter grapefruit pith, leafy green hops, and bready malt. 
M: Very smooth and crisp mouthfeel, medium body, refreshing and drinkable. Soft and bubbly carbonation. 
O: An extremely hopped up pale; I’m pretty sure I’ve had a ton of IPA’s that weren’t this hoppy. Very delicious. Thanks again for your generosity, Erik. 896 charactersscottfrie, Aug 14, 2013
3.71/5  rDev -18.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4On tap at the Village Idiot in Lexington. 
Pour is clear, orange-amber in color, and topped by a small head that hs decent retention and rather limited lacing. 
Hoppy aroma aloows only a hint of malt to show through. 
This is a weedy tasting, very hoppy, APA, with enough sweet hops to give a momentary sweet taste at the start and to limit the overall bitterness to a moderate level. 
Medium body with a touch of harshness from the alcohol. Seems like the ABV is higher than 6.4%. Overall, seems more like an IPA than an APA. 526 characterschinchill, Aug 14, 2013

A: Dark orange with a slight haze. Big, strong head with a thing layer that stays throughout the beer.
S: Strong, dank smell that stays with you. Along with FFF's Dreadnaught, strongest nose on a beer that I've ever had. 
T: This is a beer that gets all the press it receives. Strong hop flavors that mix perfectly. Sweet upfront, with a fruity flavor. The sweet/bittersweet mix is perfect.
M: The carbonation on this one is perfect. Strong hop flavor upfront that stays with you throughout, finishing in a carmel malt flavor that stays with you. 
O: Having this on tap for the first time today at Three Floyd's Brewpub exceeded all expectations. Couldn't not have been happier with this beer... was even happier when I found out that they had cases available! 783 charactersScottSwim, Aug 13, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance - Orange in color with a thin white head
Smell - This is by far the best smelling beer I have ever had, hands down. There are so many fruit and hop smells going on it's hard to even pin them down. Massive amounts of grapefruit and pineapple are definitely present with mango as well. The hop smell is dank and wet and coats our nose. I could not be more pleased with this aroma
Taste - Unlike many single APA's or IPA's that have a fantastic aroma and then have none or few of those flavors in the actual beer (Founders All Day IPA comes to mind) this beer is far from that. Everything you smell in the beer is there on the first sip. The initial wave is amazing, just as the first smell is. A gush of mango and pineapple and grapefruit come over the tongue with a wet dank hop taste following. However the only 60 IBU's and 6.5% ABV start to show as the more the beer is drank the more watery the flavor becomes and results in this beer having almost no lingering flavor on the tongue and no aftertaste
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is very thin here, almost water like. It makes the beer very session-able and will leave you wanting to drink more, but not necessarily because of the flavor profile, which off the bat is fantastic
Overall - This is without a doubt the best APA I have ever had and also has the best aroma of any beer I have ever had. That being said I was a bit disappointed in the mouthfeel and the lack of a real flavor punch I would expect from a beer that is so highly rated. It is a fantastic beer and definitely worth trying, but is not quite to the pedestal that people put it on, especially compared to Hopslam or Heady Topper. I understand those are DIPA's versus an APA but just the fact that all three are rated in the top 20 for beers 1,776 charactersWiscoBrewsco, Aug 08, 2013

4.55/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I figured I'd do my first full review on a legend--3 Floyds Zombie Dust. I'm a HUGE hopehead, so I've been eager to try this one for quite a while, especially given its near messianic status on this site (as well as others).
Poured into a tulip glass, the first thing I took in was the smell--Awesome; fresh and fruity, with plenty of hop character, this one doesn't smell nearly as "stinky" as expected (I figured the 'Zombie Dust' would have to figure in somewhere). Got a good inch, maybe inch and a quarter of foam, and the beer pours a satisfying golden orange color (relatively opaque). Not bad so far.
Two things stood out on my first sip: 1) This isn't the taste revolution I was expecting (based on hype), and 2) it's an incredibly balanced beer. It's got a full hop flavor for a beer this light (and it IS relatively light), and everything feels very even. Starts out with lots of citrus and hops, finishes with a more wheaty, creamy taste. 
Don't get me wrong, this is indeed a great beer, and I can certainly see why people like it so much--It combines the flavorful qualities of a DIPA with the lightness and drinkability of a session beer. With that being said, if I'm going just based on whether I'd choose this over my favorite hoppy beers (Navaja by Half Acre, IIPA by New Glarus, and RuinTen by Stone), the answer is no. 
So I guess this is what I'll say in the end: As a pale ale, or just a hoppy session beer, this is easily one of the best. But if you're obsessed with hops, chances are you'll find other beers that satisfy your craving more.
Kudos to FFF though, for a great job brewing, and for the fantastic bottle art! 1,648 charactersSeanBond, Aug 07, 2013

 Pouring it into the glass I noticed a slight cloudiness (as opposed to the other "greats" I have tried) I was wondering why it was this hue, and then I took a whif.. hmmm.. A bit of stinkyness that draws me in.. Kind of a musty oldness that calls my name... 
 Once I took a sip, I noticed that it was different than most traditional APA's and its close cousin the IPA.. It stood out.. It had a great aged lemony taste, and as you drink you get that skunky citrus that hit you when you opened the bottle...
 Super smooth and creamy on the feel.. So cream and smooth that its weird it doesn't taste like a milkshake.. It is really pleasant on the palate... This is my favorite feature of this beer thus far.. 
 I have a lot to explore in my beer wold. I cant wait to introduce some of these beauties into my new Cafe..

Poured the 120z bottle into a standard pint glass to review.
Very loosely packed head of about an inch in height. Cloudy and golden yellow in color.
Smells very clean and hoppy with citrus and pine notes dominating. 
Taste is certainly hop forward; citrus and pine again, as the nose predicted.
Medium body with a creamy smooth drinkability making it go down very quickly.
I wish I could get this more regularly, it is a great beer. I like it a lot more than Alpha King and this would work as a nice option to Sierra Nevada which is a staple for me. 677 charactersibbjamin, Jul 29, 2013

A: No comment on the bottle art. Perfect design of Tim Seeley. A zombie that looks coming from a Spawn Graphic Novel. Pours a dark orange color. Slightly hazy. Forms a big, creamy and soapy yellow head with excellent retention and tons of lingering and soapy lacings left in the glass. A thin creamy layer remains forever on the top
S: Citra is really a great hop. I like it very much, mainly because of its tropical fruits profile. It's quite like mango and passion fruit mixed up. Strong malt character too. Caramel malts, mainly. A bit bready in the very end
T: Pretty like the nose. A slightly sweet upfront. Very fruity. Again, strong notes of mango and passion fruit. A bit of oxidization. A bit bready. Strong notes of caramel malts. Moderate but excellent bitterness. Excellent bittersweet balance
M: Medium body. A bit molasses. Good carbonation. Bittersweet caramel aftertaste
O: Excellent drinkability. Excellent FFF 969 characterseduardolinhalis, Jul 26, 2013

Aroma of grapefruit and citrus hoppy notes is quite sublime with some very limited bitterness notes. Taste is also totally dominated by the best fresh grapefruit hoppy notes I have ever taste. Some citrus notes are also present with bitterness being at a low level for that kind of hops attack. Body is average with good carbonation. I was sceptical about how good this beer could be but was I ever wrong. 505 charactersPhyl21ca, Jul 23, 2013

Eye: Best pouring beer I've had in ages! Now its a cloudy orange in color and clarity, but the head definitely makes up for it. Two finger head creamy in texture with very nice lacing. Really, what more could you ask for; clarity...well that'd just be filtering out what makes this beer awesome. Head and lacing just stick around forever... can't really ask for much more.
Nose: Very nice citrus aroma from the hops, lemon but lime is key here. Very limey hop aroma. I'm loving this beer already just from smelling it! Really just awesome, I'm getting Kaffir Lime Leaves in the aroma here, I know that its just the hops, but damn! this is flipping great! Off the beaten path here, I mean its not floral, it is citrusy, but of a differnt type-not grapefruit. As it gets warmer some more floral character comes out. 
Tongue: Exquisite balance between malt and hops here. Citrusy and orange type notes come from the hops, some lime in there as well. Damn! just overall one of the best beers I've ever had. It is definitely on my top ten list as you should better fucking try this beer! This beer is above all others in its category, it is easy drinking...I mean damn its hard to describe the perfect APA but this is it. Medium Body with appropriate carbonation, bitterness balances malt perfectly but this beer still ends with a hoppy and bitter profile. Everything just comes all together too perfectly, limey citrus type hops and soft bitterness that just does it....The best I"ve ever had!
Drinkability: The absolutely best American style APA I"ve ever had (as if 7-21-13). And I expect it will be quite a while until one tops this. Seriously, if you can find this than get it! absolutely awesome! I wish this beer was always available in my area, too damn bad. First beer in a long, long, long, time that has really reshaped the beer world for me. This has become a standard for me now and I am going to be comparing other beers to this....lets raise the bar! 2,071 charactersbecktone, Jul 22, 2013

But it is not an American Pale Ale. Too hoppy for style classification. Disqualified.
Really, people. Pay attention to style. Styles have meanings and characteristics for the purpose of judging. Three floyds calls this an APA when it is an IPA based on the IBU and other criteria. Judging this to be a 100 in the world of American Pale Ales is like saying the best type of apple in the world is a banana. If you don't pay attention to style parameters you shouldn't be judging any beers at all, because otherwise all we're doing here is telling the world what your OPINION is of a specific beer, and frankly, I don't care about your opinion if you can't even compare a beer against its supposed style guidelines. 726 charactersMrHadack, Jul 17, 2013

M: A good clean and crisp mouthfeel. Medium carbonation makes this sucker easy to drink!
O: Fantastic stuff. The hops just shine and make my mouth water for more. I could easily sit and geek out and enjoy one or i could go through a whole six pack in a sitting. "Lives" up to the hype. /97 919 charactersschwemjw, Jul 16, 2013

Served in a tulip glass
A - It is a hazy orange color with gold highlights. An aggressive pour yielded several inches of orange tinged, beige head. 
S - It smells like fresh grapefruit. I even detect a little malt.
T - It starts out with a mild citrus flavor with an increasing bitterness on the finish. The more I drink the more the flavor builds on my palate. Towards the end of the beer the grapefruit bitterness is very pronounced. 
M - Medium with plenty of carbonation. I get some chalkiness on my tongue.
O - This is another flavorful APA from Three Floyds. I have missed this beer a couple times by one day at local bars. I have the generosity of a stranger at Brewery Vivant to thank for the opportunity to try this beer. I like this beer, but it seems overhyped. Although, it makes a great session beer. After having this beer I did crave another. Sadly, I will have to wait until August when I visit the brewpub. 944 charactersbuschbeer, Jul 14, 2013

Head retention is tremendous on a mostly frothy head. Lacing is a larger latticework down the glass and very consistent.
S- Huge, big, colossal amounts of piney hops bitterness. Slight floral notes intermingle towards the middle of the scent, but almost the entire hops presence is pine flavors. No malt scents escape the domination of the hops.
T- Once again, the hops bitterness begins and proceeds to dominate the flavor of the beer throughout. More bitter, pine hops flavors that are moderate to strong. Tastes like an IPA for the first half of the beer, before letting up a little for the tiniest hint of malts. At the end of the drink, it's right back to the piney and floral hop flavors. Lingering bitterness on the tongue.
M- High in carbonation, yet thick feeling for a pale ale. Big hops are harsh on the tongue, but their deliciousness begs to be drank. Sessionable if savored, yet quaffable if thirsty.
Overall, it lives up to the hype. Not quite as smooth and balanced as a Pliny, but Three Floyds isn't going to smooth; they're looking to crush you with undead hops....and they are victorious. 1,223 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jul 11, 2013

Appearance: the label says this beer is "gushing", and that was definitely my experience. Medium orange hue with a touch of haze and a strong effervescence. Head is two fingers of pillowy, creamy ivory foam with great retention.
Smell: sweet, rich malt with a good citrusy, grapefruity character. There's some earthy pininess in the mix as well; I like it.
Taste: very citrusy all around, but with a very smooth bitterness characteristic of Citra. Bittering is also relatively low, consistent with the APA style. Extremely well balanced; this is not a hop bomb but stays within style while still being very hoppy and flavorful. I was really looking forward to this beer; I guess I was expecting something over-the-top, but I am even more impressed by its quality while still adhering to stylistic guidelines.
Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation for the style and a satisfying creaminess. Good stuff!
Overall: exceedingly well balanced and incredibly drinkable. I wish I could get this beer more easily in these parts. It would definitely have a regular place in my fridge. 1,140 charactersflagmantho, Jul 07, 2013

Pours a rich copper color with a half inch white head. The smell is big on citrusy hops, wow, impressive. The taste...just blows me away. This is so complex and such a rush of flavors. piney, citrusy, sweet, bitter, malty. everything combined into one. i can't describe them all. Every sip is something new, and i find myself taking continuous sips to try and pinpoint all that my mouth is experiencing. Great feel as well, medium bodied with medium carbonation. superbly easy to drink. 
Overall this is a world class beer that lives up to the hype, and may even exceed it. I've never tasted another beer quite like this one. I wish i could have it all the time. 690 charactersAxnjxn, Jul 02, 2013

4.1/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Appearance - Pours a clear golden orange with an off-white 2-finger head. Good retention leads to a solid layer of microbubbles across the top. Fair lacing all-around the glass with good stick. I don't usually count bottle artwork into the appearance score, but this bottle is too baddass not to add another half point.
Smell - Moderate orange pith aroma. Generic malt sweetness; hard to pinpoint the driving character.
Taste - Mild orange character upfront and throughout. Juicy. Malt sweetness that doesn't quite hit caramel, nor is it quite bready either; somewhere in between, or a touch of both, however you'd word it. Flavors don't overwhelm, but hit their stride at the finish with harmony and that great balance. Lingers with a very mild orange pith bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Silky smooth feel. Goes down with such amazing ease, it's basically chuggable.
Overall - Another well-balanced pale from 3 Floyds. This one didn't blow me away as the scores have suggested, but I found it rather enjoyable all the same. Definitely trade worthy, but don't overvalue on your end to get your hands on it. 1,145 charactersTheSixthRing, Jun 29, 2013

S - fresh sharp green Hop aroma. Citrusy overall, excellent. 
T - significant hop bite at the front, with a thick malt follow up that doesn't quite, balance the hops. There is some malty sweetness, but it enhances rather than detracts from the overall flavor. This beer reaches the upper bounds of malty sweetness without becoming cloying. 
M - there a malty thickness that provides more thickness than expected. Carbonation seems on the low side of just right.
O - one of my favorites. 611 charactersboss302, Jun 25, 2013

The taste was unbelievable, It was completely everything you can ask for which provided a great hoppy taste which provides a lesser to stronger to a very lesser taste. Brushing around the pallet leaves your mouth thirsty for more. I was craving this beer for weeks after having tasted it. This is a jewel in my book, a very smooth fantastic tasting beer.

Smelled great. Nice and hoppy and very aromatic.
The color looked very inviting and it had a nice 2 finger white head on it.
mouthfeel was fine, just like most any other IPA
Taste. Very hoppy and more than you will find in a lot of Pale Ales.
overall: hate to say this, but did not live up to the hype. dont get me wrong, an enjoyable beer. but really not all that distinguishable from dozens of other pale ales and IPAs that are out there. I actually feel this way about a lot of IPAs, but this one in particular did not stand out one way or another and that bummed me out because I was so looking forward to trying it. It came off as just another hoppy IPA without any flavors that made me say wow. I could have been drinking a Sierra Nevada IPA or a Green Flash. 840 charactersderftron, Jun 24, 2013

The aroma is great. Citra is one of my favorite hops and the citrus/tropical fruits as well as grass and pine really commingle nicely in the glass. Fresh, clean and crisp are the three adjectives I would use to describe it.
Flavor profile is fantastic. Nice hop bite up font with the hops and malt balancing back and forth. Carbonation is refreshing and the mouthfeel is great. The only thing I think that could improve is the finish. I would have loved a LONG finish. This beer's finish is short, sweet and to the point. Definitely doesn't take away from it as a whole and most certainly doesn't alter my grade.
A fantastic APA. At the end of the day, I think it represents the Pale Ale style nicely. Sure the hops are a little more aggressive than in your run-of-the-mill Pale Ale, but it is the pinnacle of the style. So glad I get to tick this one off. 954 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Jun 23, 2013

They have been doing this about every time I go in there because they say I am a good customer. :-) Normally, IPA's, APA's are not on my radar because I normally don't prefer hoppy beer. 
I notched my score up because I think someone who does like this style would probably love this beer. The smell is great. It has that grassy hop taste that is common to this style. But there is something silky smooth about Zombie Dust. It's aftertaste isn't just an aftertaste. It's more like this green velvet over coat for your tongue and the roof of your mouth. That's what really strikes me it's not merely an aftertaste but a coating you can feel and taste long after you've swallowed. I've never experienced such an amazing, live aftertaste. Zombie Dust is very hoppy, floral, kind of fruity and very tasty. 856 charactersrbmjr1, Jun 23, 2013
4.65/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75First of all, I went into this tasting with a bias AGAINST Three Floyds. I have had Gumballhead which I liked, and Pride and Joy which I did not. I thought maybe with the hype they had a little Emperors New Clothes thing going on.
I apologize. I was wrong.
APA is probably my favorite style, and up to this point Daisy Cutter was my personal favorite.
Poured from the bottle into a standard pub glass. Color was an excellent golden amber with nice two finger head that had staying power. Very pleasant citrus fruit smell from the hops. On the first drink I was just blown away. Complex, juicy, balanced flavor with grapefruit and shortbread notes. Just fantastic. The type of beer that you want to savor each drink but can't wait to take another. Light bitter aftertaste that just begs you to pick up the glass again.
My local bottle shop gets about a case a month of ZD and breaks it up with a two bottle limit and sells out in about two hours. I will be waiting on pins and needles for the next 30 days. 1,009 characterspmorey, Jun 23, 2013

A: Crystal clear copper color with a thick white head that leaves a thick coating of lace. 
S: Massive citrus and tropical fruit nose, like Hawaiian punch
T: Juicy, fruity hops with a subtle bitterness at the end. Slight crystal malt sweetness adds to the fruit punch feeling. 
M: On the high side of carbonation for the style helps to balance out some of the sweetness, comes across as a weird (in a good way) mix of sweet/fruity and dry. 
O: Holy crap, this is a tasty beer, an amazing amount of "new" hop flavors without being a ridiculous bitter bomb. Almost too easy to drink, I could finish a six pack in one sitting, but the alcohol would eventually catch up and that is a shame :) I keep flashing back to my memory of Masala Mama last summer (also an amazingly good beer). Highly recommended. 844 characterswspscott, Jun 21, 2013

The beer has a two finger tall fluffy cloudy off-white head that reduces to a medium sized half finger tall dense foamy cap with a thin film covering the majority of the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate to significant amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Moderate aromas of toasted and caramel malts underneath much more intense aromas of citrus/grapefruit/orange, tropical/mango, and pine hops.
T: Upfront there are moderate flavors of toasted and caramel malts that impart a light to moderate amount of sweetness. The malt flavors are followed up by even more intense hop flavors than were present in the smell - there is a significant amount of citrus/grapefruit and citrus/orange followed by moderate amounts of tropical/mango and finally a light to moderate amount of pine. Moderate amounts of bitterness in the finish which lingers slightly.
M: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Crisp upfront and slightly dry in the finish.
O: This is an extremely enjoyable beer with wonderful flavors and aromas from the hops - I really enjoy the combination of the citrus and tropical hops with just a touch of pine. I found the beer to be quite easy to drink and extremely enjoyable. I would drink this beer all the time if only I had easy access to it. 1,463 charactersdbrauneis, Jun 19, 2013

The pour is a colorful hazy golden shade of orange, like the sun just before you see if the last time each night. The head is that of an IPA, bright white, foamy and meringue like. Good retention, it never fully dissipates. Great lace.
Pine, citrus and flowers. Smells like the Pacific Northwest, with grapefruit and pineapple thrown in. 
While the smells are slightly subtle, the taste is just the right degree of each ingredient. The earthy pine and citrus fruits are more aggressive, but never obnoxious. I don't know how you'd improve upon it.
The mouthfeel is also perfection. There's complexity with lots of different things happening from sweet to piney to bitter. It's a bit more bitter than an APA, but slightly less so than an IPA, so it's more of a hybrid, but it hits all the right notes with a smoothness that is only matched by a couple other beers. Medium bodied with a lasting bitterness.
Overall, the only thing I would change is giving it a higher ABV. Aside from that, it's a chart topper that's easy to drink. 1,077 charactersRickS95, Jun 17, 2013

4.95/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5With or without the hype, I was thrilled to see this coming to The Attic. Fortunately, I had written a small article on it when I first drank it, so it didn't matter that my review was somehow lost in the internet's hereafter.
A thick, cloudy, beastly-looking pale ale that's simultaneously a deep golden-amber, Zombie Dust looks like the beer I was hoping for. A heavy, thick pillow of whitish head crowns it. Retention speaks well to the overall character and structure, as does a heavy lacing that sticks nicely to the glass. 
The aroma reaches my nostrils before the head is fully formed. This is one beautifully pungent brew. Huge citrus and tropical fruits make a melody of sweet and bitter, ripe, raw, sweet and gently tart. It's plenty hoppy without being unbalanced. In fact, balance is perfect.
The complexity in this beer is unbelievable. Also unbelievable is that it could possibly fit into the pale ale range, which I realize is up for debate. I do doubt that this beer could possibly possess more complexity, better balance, more depth, or more strength without going overboard. Between the massive variety of tropical and ctitrus fruits, zest, resin, and perfect balance from bread and cramel notes of the malts that are exactly the right amount to let the Citra hops reign, I really doubt it could improve.
The medium body is exactly the strength needed for this beer, and the carbonation is at a good level. It's got a good, crisp bite while flowing like silk. The feel is close to perfect and I think the only, very slight shortcoming is the need for a little more nip. 1,588 charactersBrenden, Jun 14, 2013

Received this beer in a trade recently so I hope it is fresh...there is no indication of born on date.
Served in a balloon glass, this pale ale pours with a crystal clear orange-gold body and a 2-finger thick, off-white head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. The head dissipates to a fat island of foam that is continuously supported by little streams of bubbles. The beautiful color and clarity, plus the scars of lacing are good indications that this beer is going to be delicious.
The aroma is a veritable perfume of fresh tropical fruit and hops. Fermented pineapple juice garnished with oranges comes to mind. This is possibly the best example of an extremely hopped up beer with a cat piss aroma that I can remember. There is a faint medicinal, alcoholic aroma in the background. It is a powerful aroma that surely cannot be confused for a session beer. Any notes of malt seem to be absent from this beer.
The flavor is also geared heavily towards their hop addition, with a big, juicy hop bite up front and a gentle bitterness in the finish, which is a good differentiation from an IPA. So, along with some mild bitterness mid-palette, the beer shows off the citrus & tropical fruit notes towards the swallow. There, a light doughiness comes out in the exhale, giving the drinker some light malt flavor, but it certainly plays second fiddle to the intense flavors of lemons, oranges, pineapple, and pine needles.
Three Floyds keeps this beer out of IPA territory with how they treat this beers body in my opinion. It is medium bodied and it finishes kind of dry. There is an abundant amount of carbonation, though not overdone. There is only a light astringency from the hops. This is a very well-designed mouthfeel and very worthy of a 5.
Zombie Dust is an excellent beer! I am glad that I got to review this beer, and I certainly have a lot of respect for Three Floyds out-doing Alpha King. Pale Ales and IPAs are so abundant and while this isn't the best that I have ever had, it is definitely a world-class American Pale Ale. 2,065 charactersMusicaleMike, Jun 14, 2013

A: 4.5 Deep golden, very clear. Pours with 1.5 fingers of head that slowly fades. 
S: 4.75 Very citrusy, as expected with an all citra recipe. Grapefruit seems to be in the lead, with orange, lemon, and lime behind. 
T: 4.75 Similar to smell. Citrus notes all around. Great balance of malt and hop, blends together nicely and masks any alcohol. 
M: 4.0 This is a very smooth feel. Carbonation level is a little high, and I only say that because it slightly interferes with all the flavor going on. 
O: 4.5 This is one of my favorite beers. Great for many occasions - stronger than a session so able to hold its own, but very drinkable where a few won't put you over the top. I am a fan of citra hops, so I assumed I'd like this one going in. Wish I had more readily available access. 816 charactersroger617, Jun 14, 2013

4.34/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Really pleasant, sessionable, citrusy APA. Very well done, well balanced and all of that. But this is one that I do not think is worth the hype surrounding it and that benefits more from its relative rareness and awesome name.
I like that the beer is a little cloudy and resinous. It makes for a really fresh and flavorful feel and taste.
I'm not dying to cross state lines and seek this one out, but I certainly would be happy on the receiving end of a pint/bottle.
The label is awesome. 488 charactersJRO, Jun 11, 2013

Smell is citrus, pine and a little malt, orange and lemon really shine through
Taste is very citrus forward with lemon and orange, pine mingles in nice, malt is there but not as much as I like in my pales, highly bitter but does not over stay its welcome. 
Mouthfeel is crisp and delicious, leaves you slightly dry and wanting more.
Is this the end all APA it is made out to be by some on this site??? No, is it a damn good one? Yes, While there are many Pales I enjoy more this is still a good beer if you are looking for more of a IPA type Pale (really a IPA is what this beer is)
Glad I had the chance to try it! Probably will not go out of my way for more. 702 charactersnickapalooza86, Jun 08, 2013

A - Appears amber and filtered (non-hazy) with a nice two finger head. Pretty standard appearance for an IPA or APA.
S - Incredible. Fresh, juicy, citrus hops, grapefruit smells.
T - This is just outstanding. A perfect combination of citrus and piney hops through out - sustained from the start to the finish.
M - Appropriate for the style. Moderately carbonated with just a touch of thick elixir. 
D - Here is where this one shines. Crisp, fresh, and very easy to drink. This might just be the most drinkable beer I've ever had from FFF. I could easily kill the 6 pack on my own. 
If you haven’t had it I recommend you hunt it down. 741 charactersUncleserg, Jun 08, 2013

Retention is fantastic, still a couple mm of denser head over the entire surface nearly 10 minutes late. Lacing is absolutely fantastic!
S - Absolutely amazing, strong bitter hoppyness, citrus - grapefruit, pineapple, slight lemon, melon, slightly spiced. Smells like heaven.
T - Ohhh yeahh. Light juicy hops, lots of lemon, melon, pineapple type flavors. Bitterness support the fruit nicely. Slightly spiced. Finish is almost entirely citrus mouth watering deliciousness. Bitterness is relatively tame but returns for the aftertaste.
M - Its up there, at least a 4.5-4.75 but I think this is up there with my favorite brews period. Medium bodied+, leaves a wonderful thickness on my tongue, fairly refreshing, not a lot of carbonation.
O - Huuuge thanks to boilermakerryan for this one! First time for me - looking forward to bringing some of these home for my buddys bachelor party! Did not expect it to be this good. 1,011 charactersMacQ32, Jun 08, 2013

I wish I could have this everyday. 1,234 charactersStonedTrippin, Jun 03, 2013

Looks beautiful in the glass, light amber, tangerine almost. great head.
The smell is the first thing that makes me smile with this beer. When fresh, the citra hits you in the nose like a stink bomb filled with citra hops
The taste is parallel to the smell. 
Mouth feel isn't quite refreshing, but a little tingly, and the hops remain for a while.
Overall. Fantastic. A top 5 beer for me. With a lower ABV than some of my favorite DIPAs with the same hop presence, this gets me smiling. 529 charactersrhartogsq, May 30, 2013

A - There's nothing amazing about the appearance, but nothing wrong either. It's solid color with slight haze. 
S - There are all sorts of citrus and sweet notes here. It's really hard to describe, but a flower is pretty close. 
T - This is where the beer shines. It is wonderfully complex, but for someone like me who goes through a case every few months, it becomes a standard and makes all other beers taste bland. The taste is very similar to the smell. At first, it's very strongly floral, but as you sip on it, it goes to being very citrusy and sweet. 
M - The beer is extremely smooth for the complex taste it contains. The afterfeel is a little sticky, but this is a good thing. 
O - This beer is amazing on the first try, and only gets better the more you drink it. It definitely lives up to its hype. This is one of the very few beers that I will give a 5.0 for overall. 998 charactersnawpnawp, May 26, 2013

A--big, fluffy head. looks like a doily around the glass. dark golden, dark straw colors.
S--pine, grass, citrus. very fruity, very earthy. DIPA-like.
T--interestingly, this changed every four ounces.
1st third-big-time american ipa flavors: grass, funk, bitter citrus, booze, citra, centennial.
2nd third-english ipa: doughy malt, fuggles, goldings, mellowed hop bitterness.
last third-esb: muted hoppiness, bready, nearly no bitterness, uncannily smooth.
M--rich, yet dry. good carbonation makes it extremely sessionable.
O--when i opened this beast, it was dank american ipa with a nose the likes of heady and abner and lunch. it really, really mellowed from something astoundingly pungent and mildly abrasive to something resembling a cask session ale. after watching kimmich's video on why he cans HT, the taste variations in my experience beg the question: if this were canned, would it have retained its
first third ipa characteristics a la heady? 
nonetheless, it was damn tasty and covers a lot of ground at 6.4% abv. 1,045 characterspatm1986, May 22, 2013

S: Citric hop notes leap out of the glass. The bouquet is uncluttered earthiness: forest greenery, lemon and mango, with the musty-sweet malt beneath.
T: Great balance between the caramel, honey-biscuit malt and the sharper hop notes on the front. Not fruity, just wonderfully bittersweet.
M: Light and drinkable. Not the slightest bit overbearing
O: This is a compulsively drinkable ale. Really nice to experience a balanced brew with a subtle but still robust flavor profile. Wish I could enjoy this with every meal; already plotting how to get more. Thanks to Matt for the bottle.

Thank you Omensetter for the quick sending, as well as the freshness promised!! 
Appearance - an almost aggressively robust 2 inch head on the pour! Straw in color with a slight haze.
Smell - A lot going on in the nose - I'm getting tropical fruit and almost a peanuty-ness? Very interesting
Taste - doesn't disappoint...the nuttyness comes through again although its framed with clear and crisp citrus
Mouthfeel - really well balanced, well carbonated and goes down real well
Overalll- really really impressed with this beer. Wish I could drink it all the time!! 618 charactersktblue22, May 19, 2013

A: Golden amber orange, big three finger slighlty off white head that retains to a skim, excellent lacing left on the glass.
S: Big hop smell with lots of oranges, lemons, candied citrus and a little bit of pine. Decent caramel malt sweetness in there as well. Really good smelling brew.
T: Right upfront it hits you with a firm, dry hop bitterness with oranges, lemons and grapefruit peel, also some citrus as well. Malt does a decent job at keeping it balanced but the hops win in the end, still very drinkable all things considered. 
M: Lighter end of medium, good crispness, very easily drinkable.
O: Damn I wish we got FFF here in MA, this is just an awesome Pale Ale, love the single citra hop, really showcases well with this brew ans overall its very tasty. The only thing I'm gunna knock it for is not having a bottle date. 917 charactersDools9, May 17, 2013

Smell has a really great clean malty aroma that is balanced perfectly with bright orange citrus hops that give it a really nice clean crisp scent.
Taste follows the nose. Really great clean grainy malt body is balanced perfectly with a lot of crisp juicy citrus hop flavors and moderate bitterness. All around well balanced. 
Mouthfeel is awesome. Crisp clean feel with a medium body and moderate carbonation leave this very drinkable but not to thin. Mild bitterness lets the flavors and hop oils last well after it has been swallowed. 
All around great beer. I'm surprised its taken me this long to rate as it's constantly in my fridge. 752 charactersFcolle2, May 17, 2013

4.3/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I received a six pack from redsand22, thanks again, along with a bottle of Permanent Funeral. Between three of us, we polished off the sixer in a night, yet another good offering in a long line of pale ales that I've had recently.
ZD is an interesting beer and deceptively strong for its ABV. Normally, with a strong nose and citra hop profile like this, I'd see this kind of beer landing right between seven and eight percent by volume; though it's close, ZD has a little less than that, and ever fewer than expected IBUs. It drinks like a big malty IPA, like Sucks or Undercover Investigation Shut-Down, and honestly I found it difficult to discriminate between it and other west coast IPAs. This isn't to say that it's not delicious, of course, but it seems to me that the popular pale ales all fall on the bitter end of the malt spectrum. They're still sweet in their own right, but nothing like Hopslam, Union Jack, Sculpin, or Head Hunter, all of which I prefer to ZD. Of course, getting down and dirty with cross-style comparison is a no-no on Beer Advocate, I'm comparing them by way of taste. Like I said, I don't taste a huge difference between ZD and Lags IPAs and DIPAs, even though they're technically different styles.
Would I get ZD again? Of course. It's delicious, affordable, and brewed year-round, even if it's difficult to get off site. A fresh bottle of it would blow a stale bottle of any of the above listed beers out of the water, but that's not to say that it's better. The margin of difference between these top tier IPAs, DIPAs, and PAs is so slim that it's negligible. 1,598 charactersJamesShoemaker, May 16, 2013

A - Awesome hazy orangish gold. Awesome puffy light head that stays around and punches lacing into the pint glass.
S - Lemon pith, orange juice, citrus everywhere. Very light malty toast notes
T - Not very balanced, but awesome nonetheless! It definitely showcases the Citra hops well. Barely toasted bread, orange pith, pomelo, aspirin big time, almost a sort of implied saltiness.
M - Nice and light. Perfect timing that I got this at the start of summer in TN
I love this beer so much that even though I can tell the certain batch I am drinking now is not the freshest, it still does the trick! 703 charactershopoilcrazy, May 16, 2013

Super mouthfeel on this beer with just the right amount of carbonation , goes down so smooth
The taste is super hop forward , the malt kind of comes through in the middle the the malt and the bitterness comes through at the end. 
This is just wonderful , the flavors are all so complex but come together so nicely and make for one hell of a brew. 522 charactersubenumber2, May 14, 2013

I'll never forget the first time I had this. I was new to craft beers, though I knew what to look out for. As a noob, I found myself taking sip after sip of my glass, getting a lot of flavor, but not enough of it, so I wanted more. 
Living in IL, I take ZD for granted sometimes, as FFF releases it whenever they can. I don't hunt for it all the time, but when it's on sale at the brew pub, or if I see it on a shelf, it's a special treat.
I'm a single hop guy, I like to experience the pure flavor of a single hop in all its glory. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy complex beers, but that can get very subjective at some point. 
It looks wonderful for an APA. a bright amber hue, head that sticks to all sides of your glass, never liquefying, but clinging on as proof to the solidity of this beer. It smells rich. It smells of that signature FFF taste. It tastes of the signature FFF beer, but with a sweet citrus that seems to fight with the bitter finish. Crisp. Refreshing. Sits on the palate for just the right amount of time. Lingering. Begging for another sip. The mouthfeel is medium, just enough to not be chewing gum. So you want more. 
I'm biased. Citra and Mosaic are my favorite hop variety. But if you enjoy citra, This is worth seeking out. You'll need the whole six pack. 1,336 characters4amepiphany, May 14, 2013

A - Pours a cloudy dark amber, fluffy thick three finger head. Sticky lacing lingers throughout as I drink the beer. 
S - Lots of tropical and citrus fruits, very strong nose. No apparent malts in the nose, definitely very unique for the style and trending towards IPA. 
T - Oh wow, am I drinking fruit or am I drinking fruit. A lot of orange peel, mango, kiwi, and even orange juice itself. Definitely does not drink like a pale ale, where the typical biscuity malt backbone would be expected. To a fault, this throws it to the side of being unbalanced. 
M - Heavier than a typical APA, but had no issues with drinking multiple in a night. Not too sticky or heavy on the tongue. 
Overall, I would have to say this is the best APA I have ever had, but not to say that it is traditional in any sense. A wonderful explosion of juiciness I would love to have again in the future. 959 charactersnesarebad, May 13, 2013

Appearance-pours a dark amber with a thick khaki head. Some nice lacing about. 4.25
Aroma- lots of grapefruit and orange peel. There's also a lot of tropical citrus in there to. For a pale ale the citrus is very heavy. 4.25
Taste-grapefruit is killing it in this one. Some apricot and a little mango/pineapple tropical touch in there to. Fresh ground pepper at the end of the tounge is good as well. For a pale ale it's tops. 4.75
Feel-this has a very smooth even feel. I could see drinking this all day long. Coats mouth completely and leves it want more. 4.25
Overall-this is a great beer. I purchased this with some other Three Floyd's beers that must have been very old. This is the only that lived up to the hype. It's solid thru and thru if I could get more of it I would. The problem is I can't and could find stuff regular that comes close to this. Taking that out of the picture and rating this by itself I say it is a epic pale ale that tastes like a great IPA. 4.5 1,017 charactersscreamking, May 12, 2013

This is a brew that I love when fresh. I don't think any brew can beat it. So many tropical fruit notes in the taste and smell. I love it! 
Now on the flip side: if this beer sits for a couple of weeks it becomes average. Over a month it's almost a drain pour. All in all, if you can get this fresh,by all means get it. You will dig it! 445 charactersIrishHockey, May 12, 2013

Look - Pours a hazy amber orange with a great soapy head. Sticky lacing. Moderate carbonation. My kinda look for this style of brew.
Smell - Aroma a grapefruit hyper-bitter hop with resiny overtones. Smooth maltiness throughout.
Taste - Snappy crisp malt with smooth (grapefruit, orange, sour pineapple) citrus, pine, and resin hops coming in after. Smooth as hell, sweet caramel malts are perfectly balanced.
Mouthfeel - Nice bitter resting on the palate, super drinkable and muted ABV. Ridiculously smooth.
Overall - The king of these kinds of hops, similar hops to the Surly line are present, I love those hops. Super smooth even creamy with a bite and some balls. 100% recommend. 857 charactersJMScowcroft, May 10, 2013

4.59/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours with a three finger creamy head. Very cloudy, amber orange.
Smells of very fresh grapefruit and some subtle lemon zest. A touch of nutty creaminess.
Taste is just fantastic. Highly balanced pine and citric grapefruit notes meld with the dulce de leche sweetness. It stays light somehow through out all the tastes. Definitely a hoppier pale ale, but very well balanced. It has a slightly thin character to the taste but suits its amped up sweet hop profile.
Mouthfeel is a moderately carbonated. Zingy and crisp, slightly viscous.
Overall, this is a fantastic pale ale. One of the best I've tasted and a definite try. 626 characterslsummers, May 10, 2013

O - While hoppy enough to be an IPA in my mind, this is just so smooth to justify being an APA. Flavor explosion. Taste and mouthfeel are a 5 in my opinion. I wish I could raise more of an aroma from it though. That is the only thing that keeps it from being perfect for me. Still, undoubtedly one of the world's great beers. Well done! 860 charactersrjp217, May 08, 2013

4.12/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a a 12 ounce bottle into a Dogfish Head signature glass.
A: A finger and a half of head tops an plain-looking auburn beer. Clearish, orangeish, and full of effervescence. Not much to knock.
S: Dusty, musty, and strange. This could be just raw hop oil that smells almost like hash; it's vegetal, bitter, and pungent. Not entirely pleasant. I am unsure what to expect from the flavour.
T/M: Hmmm. Wow. Very hoppy, but very thin. I suppose this is what it would taste like to overhop a pale ale to its breaking point. The body is not substantial, but is full of carbonated pale malts, crisp and dry. It's very refreshing...or it would be, if the monumental hoppiness weren't distracting. It tastes great, don't get me wrong. It reeks of soft juiciness, blueberries and mango, pine needles, faint-sweet citrus. The hop bitterness is significant. The aftertaste is biscuits and bitter herbs. 
O: I wonder if this bottle wasn't a little out of date, and I'd be keen to try it certainly fresh. As it stands, it's an interesting experiment that might be a little extreme. But I like it, maybe even love it. Recommended, but potentially overhyped. 1,154 charactersAgentMunky, May 08, 2013

T: follows the nose. Loads of citrus. Very hoppy. Exotic fruits aren't nearly as strong as the orange, grapefruit, and lemon sweetness. It's offset with heavy bitterness.

With off the charts BA ratings for Zombie Dust, and my Vermont craft beer spoiled palate, I was ready to crack the top after finishing up a late night of work deadlines.
The second the top is popped, the hints are present that something special is about to happen.
Cloudy peach colored goodness pours into the Lawson's tulip with a half inch of soapy white head. Lacing was exceptional and the cap remained until the last sip. There is a dankness in the nose that draws you in immediately: the citrus tones including pineapple and mango are present but not overly assertive, and in the world of six pack beer this is rare.
Taste is a wonderful balance of citrus,piney resinous hops, and just the right amount of bitterness on the dry finish. Medium bodied and expertly carbonated, Zombie Dust dances gracefully over your palate, and the anticipation for every sip builds as you drink this fabulous Pale Ale. Completely worthy of the stellar ratings and all the hype surrounding it, Three Floyds really delivers a world class gem with Zombie Dust and it gets my highest recommendation for hitting all the right notes. Exploding with all citra hop goodness, Zombie Dust is a must have for serious hop hunters! 1,326 charactersHendry, May 02, 2013

A: Copper. Translucent. Poured a finger head that retreats to a substantial rim that is frothy and a blotchy film. Superb layers of frothy laces that remain the entire beer.
S: Floral. A little citrus and a lot of hops at the end. This is a moderate to highly fragrant ale. 
T: The taste is the reverse of the nose. Strong hops hit on the front that gives way to a floral finish. Very hoppy overall, but not very bitter. Slightly piney.
M: Full bodied. High carbonation. Moderately smooth. Leaves a very clean palette.
O: A top-notch pale ale. Very hoppy, but the clean finish makes it great for non-hop heads. The laces are amazing. This ale will open up, especially the smell and taste, so be patient. 742 charactersmacher0, May 02, 2013

The aroma has a very pungent aroma of citrus and pine. The taste is very hoped up, kinda sweet but not over powering. i get a hint of carmel on the back of the tonuge. The mouthfeel is very nice, a little thick but just rolls off the tongue really nice.

4.6/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5While it was impossible to find even a single bottle of this during DLD weekend in Chicago, I was glad that they were tapping this all day at the brewery. It definitely made waiting in line far more pleasant! Poured into a 16oz plastic pint cup.
Pours an orange-amber color complete with a strong dose of carbonation and a creamy, frothy looking head at the top. Despite its low ABV, it's surprisingly viscous and thickened with each swirl, almost to the point where the hop resin oils are revealing themselves already at this point. Lacing is enormous on this thing, and the fact that foam is sticking around the plastic so well as here is both amusing and pretty awesome. Not too many bubbles stick around, although each sip is definitely followed by a large geyser of them as they crawl to the top and maintain the head going. The head in particular never dies down. Honestly, I can't really find any flaws here. The appearance is nice and typical to these types of beers but the oily look is gnarly enough to give this a perfect passing.
The aroma is quite different too, especially in terms of APAs - although I admit I'm quite new to all of these Citra single hop focused beers in recent years. However, if any beer is at the forefront in displaying this hop, it's this one. Getting a breeze of orange grove notes, as well as limes, freshly mown grass, pungent yet vibrant earthiness, and tons of other flavors (although I think they're subtle). Pineapples, pine, maybe a little bit of other tropical fruits abound, but it's not explosive by any means. Nevertheless, it's phenomenally pleasant in the same way other world-class hoppy beers (Pliny, 2 Hearted, etc) are. The pungency of the fresh, oily hop character is quite fantastic here. I must mention, rather than ramble about hops for the next paragraph, that the malts provide an excellent backbone towards balance here, with light caramel that integrates the earthy, citrus notes very well. Very good stuff.
The flavor really opens up whatever was going on in the aroma, to successful results. The citrus character immediately gets at the tip of the tongue, combined with juicy, malty characteristics that envelop a full bodied fruit experience. There's a pungent, earthy backbone here that compliments the hoppy, floral, slightly grassy flavor, which is is more accentuated with the constant burst of bubbles that carry forward all of these nuances. Passion fruit, apricots, limes, and soured apples come and go, according to my notes (this changes throughout consumption). The finish contains a lingering astringency that is very much like an IPA, except far more mellow with the extra grainy and malty body, as well as less ABV. Strangely, this spicy, bittered sensation does not make the palate salivate, although it does make it crave the beer every time more. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. This is so easy to drink I think I finished all 16oz in 20 or so minutes.
Lives every bit up to the hype. This is a world class APA, but also one that sets new standards to the style, and perhaps all hop focused beers in general that are yet to be crafted. This beer is the opposite of most FFF beers, and the key difference is subtlety. The nuances change over time but never in a way that makes the beer more unpleasant to drink. It's pretty impressive what the Citra hops have to offer here, especially on their own. What appeals to me the most about this is how much it resembles a rustic, fresh homebrew of sorts. I had it the next day at a bar in town, and while it was substantially less fresh, with more muted characteristics, the oily, earthy flavor was still spot on. Great stuff - wish I could have brought some back with me to save up for the zombie apocalypse!
UPDATE (1/15/14): This is very inconsistent from batch to batch, but it's always GOOD even at its worse. I prefer it when the tropical, stone fruit dank flavor shines, but the malt profile is something that is superb in this beer and always shines as very tasty even when the hops are a bit iffy. It's pretty much the most extraordinarily balanced and hyper flavored pale ale that's easy to get overall in the country, no doubt. 4,168 charactersmagictacosinus, May 01, 2013

The guy who gave it to me said it was awesome and another beer geek said the same thing about it before I tried it. My overall impression of Zombie Dust was… “yeah, it’s good but is it really any better than Alpha King?”
Clear, peachy-amber in hue with an off-white rock star head. Good head retention and equally good subsequent lacing. It is an attractive looking beer… but aren’t most hoppy beers!
Sugary-sweet tropical and orchard fruitiness surprised me and kind of muddled the “brightness” citrus and grapefruit notes from the hops. Biscuit/toast maltiness is noticeable as well. Hop-forward but balanced. A lovely aroma, plenty complex and inviting.
Hop bitterness is moderate… plenty of flavor though, citrus, pine, grapefruit as well as tropical and orchard fruitiness. And, like the nose, sweet biscuit, toast and some caramel. A tasty beer… a nice pale ale but I don’t get the high scores here on BA.
Medium in body, standard for the style, moderate carbonation… 
Overall, like I said, tasty… good. Really good I guess. It’s just a pale ale. Thanks for the bottle Rod! 1,207 charactersbditty187, Apr 29, 2013

Beautiful orange amber in color. Two fingers of rocky off white head emerges from a standard force pour. Thick waves of lace stay on the glass as the foam slowly fades. Nose is exuberant with bursting pineapple and floral resinous notes. Pine and dandelion comes through as well. With first sip I am taken by how refreshing this beer is initially. The hop profile of this beer really builds with bitter bite. This brew really has nice malty balance while letting the hops shine. Very juicy as the citrus plays nicely. Gets piney and prickly on the back of the tongue as it finishes. Mouthfeel is not without the appropriate bitter bite and a really nice tingle that is unique and very enjoyable. 852 charactersSPLITGRIN, Apr 28, 2013

All around a very good and well balanced pale ale, just doesn't live up to the hype surrounding it. I can say that for it's type it's definitely one of the best I have had, but I rarely purchase pale ale's so I'm reviewing it from the perspective of someone who prefers an IPA and as such it doesn't match up. 336 charactersLSx, Apr 24, 2013

Aroma: A combined floral and orange zest aroma. As soon as I smelled it all I could think about was an orange tree where I lived last year in Anaheim, not just the smell of oranges but also the vegetation of the tree. This is a scent I have never experienced in a beer and frankly wasn't expecting.
Appearance: Clear, orange/amber in the shade, but a brilliant glowing orange in the light. Good head retention of about 1/4" of off-white head.
Flavor: The same unique hop flavor as the aroma! The malt in completely subdued and the floral citrus hop character is beautifully highlighted. I do not think I have tasted another beer that highlights it's hops so clearly. This can be good or bad, as if you do not like the hop character of this beer I could easily see this beer being hard to take. However, I find it extremely refreshing and enjoyable.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is on the light side of moderate, with a good amount of carbonation. The beer leaves a slightly creamy texture after swallowing. Overall very nice.
Overall: This is a great beer that I wish I could get locally. It is a beer that is so unique in it's flavor that it is hard to relax while drinking; it commands your attention. This is rare for a beer that is not overwhelming in its bitterness or flavor. Though the beers are not at all similar, Pliny comes to mind as another beer that can shock with the combination of both it's character as well as it's restraint. Excellent beer that I feel lucky to have been able to try! 1,588 charactersrboinski, Apr 23, 2013

A - Slightly foggy caramel hue with nice off-white head. Retention and lacing were top notch.
S - Mix of pine and citrus hops, bready malts, crisp caramel and a touch of grass near the end.
T - Delicate bread base which holds citrus, lemon and a fine blend of hops. Nice oils yield a particular bitterness which pairs beautifully with caramel sweetness and hop profile.
M- Crisp and refreshing medium body with moderate carbonation.
O - Superb APA that may damn well be the best out there. That said, there are a number that get close and this is by no means a runaway winner. I look forward to having more of these in the future. 716 charactersmscudder, Apr 22, 2013

Served in a cervoise
The beer poured a nearly crystal clear, golden-amber. A tight, creamy, one-finger crown of tan colored foam topped the liquid. Small patches of thick, drippy lacing coated the glass and lasted long after the beer was finished.
The aroma was perhaps the most amazingly hoppy and fragrant I have experienced in a beer. A cornucopia of tropical fruit notes jumped out of the glass. Tons of mango, papaya and passion fruit. Loads of pineapple. Some peach and apricot as well. Super complex and exotic. Exceptionally smooth.
The flavor profile was just as stellar as the nose. Intense tropical fruit notes dominated the front end. Mango, pineapple and papaya came through strongest. Juicy tangerine and candied orange peel notes appeared mid palate. Touch of honey. Ruby red grapefruit rounded out the finish. Just slightly pithy and bitter. Hints of pine resin were noticeable as well. Overall, amazingly well balanced.
The mouthfeel was commendable. Medium bodied for the style with a fine, moderate effervescence. Slick and somewhat creamy on the palate.
Calling this beer a "pale ale" is a bit unfair, as I have tasted many double IPAs had less the hop intensity or complexity than this offering. The only indications of the style here are the lighter mouthfeel and the astonishing drinkability.
Super hoppy beers that have a moderate (or lower) alcohol presence seem to be gaining popularity, and this beer is the benchmark for that category. Zombie Dust is definitely worthy of the accolades that it receives. Thank you Daniel for the opportunity to try this amazing beer AND for donating the proceeds to a terrific cause. 1,691 charactersDamian, Apr 21, 2013

Appearance - nice hazy copper; small head diminishes quickly. Decent lacing on the glass.
Smell - Big grapefruit notes with lesser pine and malt underneath. Just a hint of sweetness.
Taste - Amazingly balanced - nothing punches you in the face. Very full-bodied though. I've had a number of pale ales, and the vast majority seem empty on the back end. Not so with this one - perfect amount of sweet maltiness with the right amount of bitterness on the finish. The bitterness lingers for a bit as well. Very, very well done.
Mouthfeel - Smooth with a decent amount of carbonation - very pleasant.
Overall - Whether you normally like APA's or not, you need to get your hands on this one. It is absolutely out of this world fantastic and lives up to the hype. I also like the fact that it doesn't try to be more than it is; I'd drink this everyday if I could get my hands on it. 989 charactersdouginromeo, Apr 20, 2013

4.76/5  rDev +5.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This brew was served from the tap at the Three Floyds Brewpub in Munster, Indiana. It arrived in a generic nonic glass, showing hues of solid golden yellow. It held a half finger tall head of soft and tight white bubbles, leaving drippy spots of lacing about the glass. A ring was noted to crown the beer, while a film was set across the lacing, looking like Earth’s clouds from orbit, for the entire tasting. A light chill haze was noted without sediment, while carbonation appeared to be light. The aroma gave massive citric and raw piney hop resin. This glory met pale malts, freshly juiced red apples, and sweeter lactic cleanliness. With warmth the hops became deeper and more herbal, adding wildly robust spice and sweetness simultaneously. Our first impression was “Wow…” in regards to the incredibly juicy and fruity hop dominance against the crisp malty dryness. As we sipped, pale malts that were a bit chalky and reminiscent of inky newspaper dryness mixed with explosively wet citric hops, green sappy woodiness, fresh tree bark sweetness, tinny metallics, and orange rind zest to start things off. Palpably syrupy and oily citric hop freshness brought us swiftly to the peak, where salty ocean air freshness, solid pale malts, and light caramel brush and toast met in full flavor. The finish came with fusel herbal hop air, riding over a bolstered grain bill of wet, earthy, and spicy pale malts, mild wheatiness, and a final yeasty muddle. The aftertaste breathed of bittered citric rind, fresh grapefruit flesh with appropriately toned bitterness, metallics, faint ale yeastiness, drying woody lick, herbal slickness, black pepper, and juicy nectarine tartness. BOOM!! The body was softly medium, with huge frothy carbonation, but without an intense prickle. Wet and oily coating was licked around the palate, with slow, slow, slow dryness to the tongue that seemed leafy and hoppy in origin. Each sip gave soft but beautiful slurp, sip, cream, froth, and smack. The abv was appropriate, and the beer was amazing drinkable.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring and feel. The sip starts super fresh, clean, and crisp, developing with warmth into this outrageously complex and well-integrated drink. The malts gave a unique softness, but solid flavoring and boldness, while the hops got dirtier, more herbal, and more spicy throughout the tasting. The hops then play off the malts, sullying them and dragging them down to an equally as gritty level. The feel was soft and personally contributory to the wholeness of this experience, helping to keep drinkability just below the force of a fire hydrant. Despite the changes to this beer as the sipping progresses, it always remains welcome on the palate, definitely living up to the hype. If this is the dust of the zombie I’m almost afraid to see what meeting one face to face would be like… 2,893 charactersTheBrewo, Apr 17, 2013

A: Hazy golden orange color with a two-finger head that settles to a frothy lacing, with a steady stream of tons of tiny bubbles that for all the world looks like a glass of Champagne if it wasn't for the darker color. This alone is worth the price of admission
S: Pine sap and grapefruit rind initially, very bold, with a hint of butterscotch and malt underneath to a much lesser degree
T: Much more citrus-forward, with pine taking second stage here. Tropical fruit on the midpalate along with more prominent malt notes. Finishes out with caramel and butterscotch that are just a hint sweet
M: Perfect balance of bitter, malt and carbonation with a long finish. Medium-bodied and couldn't be any nicer
O: I've heard some say this isn't what it once was, but it's pretty damn close to what I remember from when I first had it, and that's pretty damn close to perfect. 1,045 charactersONUMello, Apr 16, 2013

Just kind of sits around patiently as if it's saying, "take your time. I'll wait." Also, some of the best bottle art out there!
Smells potent and hop heavy. Nose reminds me of Two-Hearted, but sweeter--strange considering each use a different single-hop variety. Very fruity (I'm thinking the sweetness is pineapple and the bitterness is grapefruit). Very inviting. Let's enjoy...
Sweet, rich, well-rounded, and very deep brew. It hits all parts of my palate with different sensations. Sweet and juicy on the front; a little bitter, floral, and resinous on the middle; a sweet (candi sugar)/spicy (black pepper) kick on the back. What an interesting flavor. There is also a bitter-sweet aftertaste that is very pleasant. 
The mouthfeel is light/medium and very crisp. Extremely drinkable. A little bit of resin rests on the tongue after each drink. It keeps you coming back for more. 
Overall...Yeah, I understand the hype. Definitely one of the best APAs (or IPAs depending how you categorize it) I've had. However, it didn't blow my head off and completely change my perspective on beer. Honestly, I don't think any beer can match the high expectations set for ZD. Still, it's awesome. Simply fantastic. Superb. So. Fucking. Good. 1,336 characterslunarbrew, Apr 16, 2013

I know this might be a Pale Ale to hop-crazy FFF, but to most people this is a straight-up IPA so I reviewed it as such. 
A - Looks like a typical IPA with that golden amber color. A slight head forms, but not too much, which is what beers should have. This implies a proper level of carbonation.
S - breathtaking smell of hops - this is why i love IPAs (and brewing beer)
T - citrus flavor, hops are detected but not overpowering, just a perfect blend of malts and hops to make a solidly balanced IPA.
M - Perfect carbonation level. I feel a slight tingle on my tongue as I detect the carbonation, but the beer is smooth and goes down easy.
O - How much do I like this beer? Let's just say that about once every two months my dad and I drive to Munster and purchase four 24-pack cases. This is one of my favorite beers. 934 charactersmjc3151, Apr 16, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412 oz. bottle, no bottled on date present which is typical of Three Floyds. My local beer store guys make the pilgrimage to Three Floyds regularly to pick up fresh Zombie Dust, so I am overly confident that this is about as fresh as I am gonna get it.
Poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass.
A - Semi-aggressive pour yields two and a half fingers of fluffy white head which disappears into a cap. Beautiful burnt sienna orange colored body, with a fair amount of small, light sediment floating around. Some nice thick, webbed white lacing coating the glass.
S - Smell showcases the Citra hops nicely. Smell is of fresh, juicy, bitter grapefruit rind, along with some blood orange and lemon, other citrus fruits. Slight cat piss acidity, but I mean that in a most positive manner. Smells very good and palatable, for what it's worth, but it definitely is not your typical APA smell. Somewhat soapy. Some bready, biscuit malts are to be had, as well.
T - Again, the bitter Citra hops dominate here. Fresh-squeezed, bitter grapefruit & blood orange / lemon zest abound. Tastes very fresh. Again, although I dislike the term, and I have never used it before to describe a beer, it definitely applies a bit here; the beer is some what soapy tasting.
M - Feel is full and juicy. Bitter, hoppy, and partially dry in the finish. Resinous hop-foward mouthfeel.
Overall, it is an extremely tasty, highly drinkable beer. Works better as a hoppy American IPA than it does as an American pale ale, though. Looks like an IPA, smells like an IPA, tastes like an IPA. Bready / biscuit malts become more clear and prominent as the beer warms, but this is still a very hop-forward beer. A great beer; tasty & highly drinkable. Yet, I feel it is a bit overrated & over-hyped. I paid $16.99 for a 6 pack at my local beer store, and while I think this ranks as one of Three Floyds's best beers, I still don't think it is worth that much. Either way, this is one of the flagship Three Floyds beers, and I highly recommend you get your hands on some.

Pours out a beautiful golden orange with a 2 finger, white head.
The aroma is intense! There is a ton of an orange, orange peel type of note right away followed by grapefruit, some pine and sweeter tropical fruits. 
The taste is exactly like the aroma. There is a huge amount of sweeter orange, a decent amount of grapefruit, sweeter tropical fruits like mango and apricot, some pine and just a hint of some bready malt at the end. 
The body is medium and the mouthfeel is crisp. It's a very easy drinking beer with a decent amount of bitterness for an APA. This drinks more like an IPA than a Pale Ale!
I can actually see what all the hype is about and I'm glad I got to try it. No, it's not a perfect beer, but it's the best Pale Ale I have ever tried! Believe the hype. Another winner from Three Floyds. 873 charactersJohnnyMc, Apr 10, 2013

Pours a near translucent orange hued gold with a finger and a half of fluffy white head. The head remains for quite a while and leaves a good bit of lacing. 
Smells of orange, citrus peel and piney hop goodnes. 
Taste follows the nose. Plenty of bitter sweet citrus hops. Orange, grapefruit, mango, pine and a little pepper with a sweet malty cracker and faint caramel back. Good stuff. 
Crisp but oily medium feel with a nice carbonated pop. Super easy to drink with those tasty citrus hops lingering in the finish. 
I'm not typically a pale ale fan but I'd choose this hands down over any other pale ale I've ever tried and many IPAs too. This is a smooth, hoppy treat that is very easy to drink. A must try for sure and I will most certainly request a bottle or two from any traders that can get it for me. 942 charactersThickNStout, Apr 08, 2013

M - Nice crisp, smooth. Medium bodied. Light carbonation. A pleasure to drink. 
O - Really a great beer. It is just very well rounded. Probably the best APA I have drank, although it is close with Alpha King. That said, I don't know if it quite lives up to the hype, but it is close. I will seek out this beer time after time. 790 charactersdrrone, Apr 05, 2013

a: medium amber in color, sporting a well retained white head with heavy lace
s: initial hit of vivid, beautiful hops is all fff - lots of orange pulp and bright citrus, citra is a fucking great hop, dripping with resin but never harsh, pale and caramel malts give aromas of lightly toasted sugar, forming an aromatic base

t: lovely citra hops - big orange flavor, citrus oil, light toasted sugars/caramel malt, sweetness nearing moderate, bitterness pulls through with perfect balance, hop flavors through the roof

Appearance-
Sharp orange, and depending how served a surprisingly foamy head.
Smell-
The standard to which citra hops should be held, a showcase of clean tropical fruits, citrus fruits, and a smidgeon of bubblegum.
Taste-
Follows the smell, but the hops have a bitter back. Like a good pale ale, the malt is still present.
Mouthfeel-
The hop oils give a good feel, but it remains refreshingly crisp.
Overall-
The hype is factored into this rating, but the hype followed a fantastic beer. It is drinkable in all occasions. 668 charactersRope, Apr 03, 2013

Appearance- Pours a nice hazy orange with a big lacy head. Nice looking.
Smell- Big juicy, dank, wet, earthy, hop character. Strong spruce pine vibes. Hints of sour diesel or other high grade marijuana strains. Pungent ripe blood orange notes. Great smelling IPA.
Taste- Bitter dry hop bite, quickly fades into rock candy malts. Finishes dry and clean- almost too clean, like San Pellegrino mineral water. Really easy drinking, but a bit disappointed in the flavor considering the hype around this one.
Mouthfeel- Smooth and dense leaving a puckery, tangy coat on the tongue
Overall- I waited a long time to acquire one of these, and I am thankful I got to try it. Unfortunately I don't think it meets the hype associated with it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer, but a little bit of a let down. All nose forward but a little lacking in taste. Easy drinkability and very sessionable. I will definitely drink this again if the opportunity presents itself. 1,003 charactersSaisonRichBiere, Mar 30, 2013

The smell is nice and hoppy with tropical and citrus dominating. The taste follows suit. The hops are the focus, but this beer definitely has some malty flavors as well. It's a tasty beer! Mouthfeel was a bit resiny for my tastes, but still good. Overall, it's an impressive beer. Impressive that they could get that amount of hoppiness into a balanced beer and keep the alcohol under 7%. I would definitely drink this again. However, while I don't want to knock an excellent beer, temper your expectations a little, as # 7 on the BA list seems very high to me. I belongs on the list for sure, but not up that high. 709 charactersdougfur, Mar 29, 2013

Appearance - Pours just over a finger of shiny eggshell foam, body is a gorgeous hazy lighter orange amber with golden highlights at the edges. I'm getting gorgeous defined lace rings after each quaff.
Smell - What a great nose, lots of bright pungent citrus and pine, really smells like a nice ipa vs. an apa.
Taste - Really nice citrus hops and pine here. Flavors are very bright and sharp, with the slightest of malt breadiness in the background to balance. The flavors are so bright here, and so well balanced. There is just the slightest bit of dry bread and some grapefruit pith longer into the finish, really begs the next sip.
Mouthfeel - Lighter side of medium, so clean and crisp. Carb is almost medium but so very smooth. There is the slightest smooth scrub as the carb washes over the tongue and then leaves bright tingly edges along the sides and back of the tongue, nice mouthfeel.
Overall - This really lives up to the hype for me, mainly because this looks and drinks so much like a clean balanced ipa. I barely get the bready character, its very subtle, but balances out the bright hops nicely. Really a great beer and one that I highly recommend. No alcohol presence whatsoever. 1,234 charactersblackcompg, Mar 26, 2013

Appearance: Pours a golden orange color with a half a finger of a white head. 
Smell: Smells really good. Citrus, tropical fruits, mango, peach, sweet hops, and a slight bready maltiness. 
Taste -Taste is more subdued but it mirrors the nose. More tropical fruits and minimal bitterness and more of that bready backbone in the flavor.
Mouthfeel: Very drinkable. Thin to medium mouthfeel. 
Overall: Overall didn't blow me away with all the hype but it's a pale ale. I think I prefer Alpha King but I had that fresh on tap and I think this bottle is 6 weeks old. Still my 2nd favorite pale ale and and amazing beer. 670 charactersGameFreac, Mar 24, 2013

A great friend from IL just sent me a fresh 12 pack of these beauties and I sat down to properly enjoy one poured into my 3F's Teku. THIS BEER IS AMAZING! I thought maybe I had built it up in my head based on other reviews and the excitement I had to drink more, but that is NOT the case. This is the perfect beer. Litterally. If I could rated this at a 10 I would. 
This beer is everything that I want from an IPA (I know, its an APA), you can sip it slowly, you can session it, you can live on it. I would drink this every day if it was possible. Seek out this beer and savor every sip. 785 charactersHopChef44, Mar 21, 2013

Smell: Pine hops. Not as complex as I expected, but it hits this note superbly.
Taste/Mouthfeel: Basically and IPA. Pine, grapefruit, and one of the best bodies of any beer I've had. It's sorta the Halle Berry of beer's in that department if you catch my drift. I can definitely taste why they call this Zombie Dust...it's all in the feel. Very subtle, but it lingers for quite a while after it sneaks up on you like a flesh-eating zombie.

4.58/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Served in a pint glass at Local Optiom in Chicago. Pours a hazy but vibrant orange/golden color with a really thin white head, and lots of thick cling.
Smells of bright mango/passion/citrus fruit, with a nice hop balance.
Taste is similar, with mango most obvious. It also has this resinous character to it, but it's not too piney.
Feel is nice and smooth for the style, light to medium carbonation, but nice and creamy. There is a distinct pulp aftertaste. 
Overall, Zombie Dust probably not a 5. It's very good, and I'm glad I got to try it. Would love to sample in a bottle. 581 charactersrodlavers, Mar 13, 2013

S: First noticed a strong pale malt aroma followed by a uniquely juicy fruit hops. Deep whiff is oily/resiny.
T: Pungent, hint of tangerine pucker, softly sweet as strawberries, tropical taste of mango. All the malts do is give strong support to launch such potent hop flavors, definitely strong but not struggling for attention. 
M: Slightly dry lingering, seems well attenuated by the higher alcohol and lighter body. Carbonation is subtle but lively. Hop bitterness is mild at most.
O: The beer itself does not blow me away as it is straight forward, not much complexity. However, I am extremely impressed the way the hops are showcased. FFF does something unique in their hopping process that other breweries do not replicate, and that does include the wild hop bombs of Sierra Nevada, DFH, Russian River... 974 charactersOne2Remeber, Mar 13, 2013

On the label is a zombie king wearing a gold crown, a Spider-Man style spider on his chest, a Superman cape, and holding a Thor style hammer in his left hand. To the left of the zombie king in big bold lime green comic style lettering is the name of the beer. Flanking the good king is a brief description of the beer and all the mandatory US info. No best before or bottled date anywhere. Thanks! 
When poured into a pint glass, this "supposedly" rotting blood thirsty corpse of a beer was actually a very beautiful semi hazy golden amber with some faint lemon yellow highlights. Not only was the color impressive, but the head of foam as well. The initial head of foam was a good 3/4 of an inch in height and almost as fluffy as a new pillow. As for the color, pure white. White as the driven snow. It had great retention that left behind a milky white film and streak after streak of white lace. The milky white film lasted until the last drop of beer was gone. Eye candy all the way! The beer's appearance is the complete opposite of a zombie.
Does it smell like a zombie? It certainly does not! Very potent, but not rotting flesh potent. The first aroma that came pouring out of the glass was the thick aroma of ripened to perfection grapefruit. Once my nose got its fill of grapefruit, my nose found the fresh scent of lemon zest, lemon grass, a dash of coriander, a splash of orange peel, more grapefruit, and a load of bitter citrus hops. I was able to detect a small whiff of toasted malt at the end. When I found that, the grapefruit and hops swept in and covered it up. 
This beer did not let up and it wasn't going to anytime soon. Like the aroma, the first thing that came out was the perfectly ripened bitter and tart grapefruit. Waiting patiently behind the ripe grapefruit was the great taste of tart lemon, a pinch of lemon grass, a drop of orange peel, a small slice of pineapple, and a few pine needles. The taste is not done yet. After all that, in comes a thick powerful wave of bitter citrus hops. Unlike the aroma, the grapefruit and citrus hops let in a touch of malt at the end. They didn't cover it up like they did in the aroma. They let it out of the cage for a short time. 
Despite clocking in at 6.4% ABV, this was a medium bodied beer. There was more than enough carbonation to keep your tongue entertained for hours. If that's not enough, there was also a full flavored aftertaste. The aftertaste was just as good as the initial taste and just as hoppy. The aftertaste had more bitter and tart grapefruit, tart lemon, a splash of orange peel, a few blades of lemon grass, and bitter citrus hops. This nice aftertaste lingers on for a few minutes. I'm glad that it stuck around. 
What a beer! This beer made me a zombie. Instead of looking for juicy brains, I'll be looking for more of this delicious beer. Sometimes a beer will hide behind a cool label. This is clearly not one of those beers. The beer was just as good as the label. Would I drink another one? That's a stupid question. Of course I would. I would drink a six pack if I could find a steady supply. I would like to thank my good friend Matt for giving me the opportunity to try this sweet brew. 3,295 charactersAltBock, Mar 10, 2013

12 fl oz bottle served in a pint glass, reviewed live:
A - Pours a murky golden orange color with two fingers of off-white, thin head. Retention is poor. 
S - Pungent. Sweet citrus, bready yeast, orange peel, lemon zest, caramel and grapefruit. Amazingly well balanced. A fresh hoppy aroma while remaining incredibly well balanced. As well executed as I've come across for the style. 
T - More woody and piney then I'd found in the nose. The freshness of the hops is amazing. A sturdy crystal malt backbone counters the hops nicely. Tangy citrus and resinous pine come through on the finish. 
M - Crisp and light. A bit dry even. Oily. 
D -Incredibly drinkable. I wish I had a year round supply. Great beer. My first beer from Three Floyds, and I can't wait to try more. 795 charactersblakelive784, Mar 10, 2013

This beer smells like a 5. Potent hops, extreme dose of tropical fruit.
My palate just had it's mind blown. Well, it's exactly what i was looking for. It's an IPA to me and it's world class. Peaches, pineapple, citrus, and other passion fruit - extremely tropical and a bit bitter, balanced as well. Mouthfeel is crisp, light, extremely drinkable. Overall this is IT! 528 charactersmnphish, Mar 10, 2013

4.79/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75My favorite beer. Have had many chances to drink this and it's failed me zero times. I've gotten sick of other citra hop beers but not this one, it sustains everything that I like about beer. An excellent make by FFF.
I rated it high so will discuss more about areas I didn't give it a 5, also excuse my inability to phrase fruity descriptions on paper. 
Appearance is always good, though I do prefer appearance of a slightly darker ale. Smell is fantastic, though a beer like Westvleteren to me has a better aroma. A bit more kick I suppose.
Taste, as noted above my favorite so it gets the top rating. With that had to give it top rating for mouthfeel too seeing that everytime I finish a sip or gulp in my head I'm smiling and thinking wow that was fantastic. I probably do this in reality sometimes too.
Overall, a solid 4.75. 834 charactersHOP_KING, Mar 07, 2013

Fantastic aroma and hop profile, I am in the minority but as a huge VT beer fan, this one is in a league with Heady, anything from HF and Lawson's. Appearance is as to be expected, an orange-y color, nice fluffy head and lacing that lasts and lasts. I could breathe this stuff in all night if it wasn't also so tasty -- a spectacular smell and taste, and worth trying if you can. 467 characterschuckd123, Mar 06, 2013

4.39/5  rDev -3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25APPEARANCE: Eggshell colored head which foams up to about a half an inch before gently falling into a nice, coaster-thick cap. The beer is a bright orange with a touch of haze and thousands of little bubbles streaming from the bottom. Excellent lacing with full coverage of the backside of the glass – by full I mean about 98% of the back side is covered. This is the closest thing I have seen to perfect lacing.
SMELL: Wow. Huge aroma. This reminds me a lot of Avery’s Ale to the Chief in the nose. A lot of grapefruit, some orange, more tropical fruits and a touch on anise…sounds weird, but it works. There is also a touch of woodiness along with a solid dose of sweetness.
TASTE: The citrus runs this operation and the palate instantly gets smacked with grapefruit. Hints of lemon linger on the sidelines and a very subtle tropical fruit sweetness creeps in. I’m not getting the caramel that others have described here. While the flavors are all delicious and intense the Zombie Dust is not terribly complex. This is just a straight forward, highly bitter, really tasty, citrus bomb.
MOUTHFEEL: The Dust has a wonderfully dry taste throughout the sip, particularly on the finish. There is just barely enough malt in here to prevent it from becoming a palate crusher. Crisp and clean.
OVERALL: While this may be an overhyped beer, it isn't by much and it is certainly one I wish I had regular access to. It has also improved greatly since the first time I tried it a few years ago when it first came out. Perfect porch beer for a nice, warm afternoon. 1,566 charactersStoneTSR, Mar 05, 2013

A: Pours a deep amber golden color. About a 2 finger light khaki head. 
S: Wow, cant believe this is a pale ale. Getting a ton of sweet citrus grapefruit with a smack of hops to finish. Really reminds me of some DIPAs on the nose. Blown away on the aroma with this being a pale ale. 
T: Pretty bitter citrus with some tropical fruits coming in. Very sweet similar to Hopslam IMO. The hops have noticeably faded a bit. 
M: Medium bodied, heavy carbonation with a bitter dry clean finish. Slight sweetness coats the mouth. 
O: Fantastic world class beer. Lives up to the hype even if the clouds didn't part and the angels sing when I drank it. 690 charactersCommanderOfAwesome, Mar 01, 2013

T: Bitter with a lot of citrus jumping out. Very much like a single IPA. Long aftertaste with a bit of caramel.
M: Highly carbonated, which is the most notable difference from your standard IPA.
O: This may be the best APA I've ever had. It's a level above Russian River's "Row 2 Hill 56". As much hops as a single IPA. Highly recommended. 417 charactersSirBentham, Mar 01, 2013

S: Aromas of sticky sweet ruby red grapefruit and pine, medium caramel scent
T: Super bitter with a citrus profile. Very pleasant aroma profile with an underlying bitterness that basically makes this an IPA. At 6.4% its teetering on the edge of IPA, but whatever, just a classification anyway. Very well rounded with bitterness, aroma hops, and caramel flavors. The largest downside I get out of here is the earthy aftertaste that is rather mineral intense and tannic. Light caramelization is gentle and adds to the complexity.
M: Highly carbonated and stings the tongue with a medium body for an APA. 
O: Overall this is a solid APA, strong and well flavored. After all the commotion this beer has caused in the forums for the past year or so, Id say it is slightly over the top with the hype that it received. Its good, Id drink it sure, but Id still prefer some other APA's over this one that are relatively readily available. 1,062 charactersalpinebryant, Mar 01, 2013

Pours a really nice bright orange with a nice frothy white head.
Aroma is awesome. Valencia oranges, blood orange, cara cara orange, grapefruit, lychee, mango. It is all tropical fruit and it is wonderful.
Taste is very similar to the aroma. A lot of citrus and tropical fruit flavors with a nice hop bitterness in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is smooth and nicely carbonated.

It's a good brew with excellent hop character but I am a Pliny, Heady Man and although different styles ZD seems a little dull to me. It's a World Class APA thats for sure. The beer pours a nice head and has a good flavor. Do I think it is the #7 in the World...no way. I would buy this for sure if I could get it but I would have to put it in the downstairs fridge because the upstairs one is full of Heady, Pliny and Abrasive. That said It's the best APA I have ever had....if it's an APA.
Bottom Line: World Class beer....kinda! 572 charactersthemind, Feb 27, 2013

I first had this on cask at the brewery a few months ago. Was I blown away! The smell and thick frothy head were the first two things I noticed. Must be some Carafoam in there.
I could drink a 6 pack of these every night and die a happy man. Not to mention the price point. $35 a case or roughly $8.75 a sixer. I would gladly pay double that. 480 charactershopstetrician, Feb 26, 2013

Appearance - Pours a slightly hazy golden amber. First thing I thought of was the amber from Jurassic Park that trapped the mosquito with dinosaur DNA. 3 fingers of head vanish and leave some beautiful lacing. Very inviting. 
Smell - Citrus hoppy goodness blasts your sinuses. Love this smell. 
Taste - Grapefruit, pineapple, orange peel, slight bits of tangerine. Bready backbone. Bold, hoppy aftertaste. Best tasting beer burps ever. 
Mouthfeel - Medium. Nice carbonation. Finishes clean and wet. 
Overall - A great, flavorful beer that must be consumed in moderation. I wish I could call it a session beer but it simply isn't. 2-3 of them and I'm flying high... And my tolerance is NOT low! Just a phenomenal pale ale. I challenge anyone to find me a better one. 815 characterssbxx, Feb 20, 2013

Taste- This is a pale ale, not an IPA, so don't expect a hop knockout. The hops hit you fast but fade off as the taste dissipates. I waited for the hop reinforcements like most other pale ales, but this one took the category seriously and didn't overdo it. I think that was the best thing about the beer. Definitely citrus tastes are more present than the hops. The carbonation was a little heavier, also just right. 
Overall- my favorite pale ale I've had. It would be hard to beat. 620 characterslinnymtu, Feb 17, 2013

A- Hazy cloudy golden color with a tiny frothy head around the brim. I assume the haze is due to the cask conditioning because none of my bottles were quite as hazy
S- absolutely freaking amazing! cornucopia of wonderful citrus fruit, lots of mango, tangerine, slight grapefruit on the back end. everything you want and more
T- just more of the same, an explosion of bright citrus flavors. citra is the showcase here and I'm overbidding.
m- the cask makes this out to be like a mango creamsicle...heaven

A- Pours a clear amber color with a half fingers worth of off-white head that sticks around for awhile. 
S- Awesome smelling beer. Instant citrus and pine hop notes upon popping the cap. 
T- Very hopped up for an APA. Pine notes carry over in the taste more so than the citrus to me. 
M- Medium to high carbonation, bitter with a dry finish, refreshing and extremely drinkable.
Zombie Dust is a great beer, pushes the limit on an American Pale Ale. 554 charactersvic21234, Feb 14, 2013

Poured a somewhat cloudy amber/orange color. Decent off-white head.
Orange is the first whiffs with more melon aromas coming through. Grapefruit also shines through.
After the citrus blast on the taste, light bread and a touch of caramel shine through. Decent bitter aftertaste.
Overall I liked this a lot for a Pale Ale. This is full flavored Pale which is tough to find. It is smooth and delivers a thirst-quenching taste. A great beer for the masses on the Eastern side of the US.
And thanks to the dude who shared this and the Hopslam that night. You know who you are. 633 characterskaseydad, Feb 11, 2013

Orange-yellow in color with decent lacing and as I drank more lacing was evident.
Needless to say there was a ton of citrus and juicy-fruit in the nose. 
Sharp. Huge hop presence but that's what this is all about. Beautiful malt character to accentuate the hops. This is bitter without scaring anyone away. Drinks a bit bigger than 6.4%.
Lingering resin and pine on the tongue. Finishes very dry.
Absolutely beautiful. 485 charactersstewart124, Feb 11, 2013

S: loads of citrus fruits and pine notes. A fantastic balance between floral fragrances and pineapple, sugar and lemon.
T: starts with a malty bang but is quickly subdued by the bittering hops and crisp citrus flavors. Both aspects are intense and complex but are in perfect symmetry. Impressed.
M: medium bodied with a similar carbonation level. Slightly creamy. Coats the tongue completely without battering it with hops. It's wonderfully smooth and finishes clean.
O: worth the wait, worth the price. For a guy who isn't enamored with overly hoppy pale ales, this was done extremely well. It is intricately balanced, complex and flavorful. If you get the chance, pick this up. 772 charactersInfamous7100, Feb 10, 2013

4.58/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5At long last! Finally, I've had the legendary Zombie Dust.
Appearance: Pours a typical APA color -- light orange. There's a slight haze, and a nice, creamy-like head on it. Lacing's patchy and not all that great, but it looks nice as a whole.
Smell: Think Hopslam. It smells a lot like that. Zombie Dust is tied with Hopslam as the best beer that I have ever smelled ... absolutely outstanding. A huge burst of guava/peach/citrus along with some sweet hoppiness. Glorious.
Taste/feel: Slightly letdown, though it's still an insanely tasty beer. The aroma is stronger than the taste, but that's not necessarily a terrible thing. Like many have said, this drinks more like an IPA than an APA... super tropical fruit flavors along with non-descript fruit and spice on this one. The aftertaste is slightly bitter, and the alcohol comes through a bit at times as well to dry the mouth, but me gusta. A proper amount of malt and spice on the finish to balance it all out pretty nicely. A great, GREAT beer, but a tinge overrated in my opinion, and I wouldn't consider this a very sessionable beer (besides the 6.40%) due to the dryness.
For the price, an unbelievable beer, and one of the best... $1.50 a bottle, fresh from the brewery? Doesn't get better than that. Overall though, just an extremely good beer. Best beer ever? No, but close to it. Honestly, I feel like this would score slightly lower on a blind taste test. I think a good reason this beer is so acclaimed is because of its label, and especially, its name... America's become obsessed with zombies the past few years. 1,583 charactersSerialTicker, Feb 10, 2013

12oz bottle.
A - Pours a hazy golden orange with a one finger fluffy off white head. There is a good amount of head retention, but lacing is minimal...
S - Lots of citrus fruits come through. Grapefruit, mango, orange, and a hint of pine. Scent is very inviting...
T - All the same culprits that came through on the nose. Mango, grapefruit, and orange. While the citrus hid the malt on the nose, it is evident here. Just enough to keep this from being a hop bomb. Finishes extremely smooth with light hop bitterenss. Again, the malt keeps the finish from being overly bitter. This one is delicious with a ton of citrusy hops and just enough malt to keep this balanced. Fantastic...
M - Very smooth. Medium body feel with a good amount of carbonation for the style...
O - Been wanting to try this one for a while, and glad I finally I got a chance. Definitely lived up to the hype for me. Would drink this all the time if this was available in my location. FFF knocked one out of the park here...
Cheers... 1,062 characterscomfortablynumb1, Feb 09, 2013

Pours a nice dark hazy straw/golden tone. Beautiful head and lacing.
Aroma is a beautiful mix of Citra..and all things Citra. Grapefruit, lemon, caramel, bread, touch of white grape.
Flavor is also really well balanced. Grapefruit, white grape, caramel orange, lemon, honey, intermingle with a nice biscuit background for balance.
Too many reviews here for me to elaborate on this brew too long, but overall.. beautifully constructed and now a new stalwart for me. 694 charactersczfreeman, Feb 09, 2013
1.82/5  rDev -59.8%look: 3 | smell: 1 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 |  overall: 1.5Appearance was fine. Nothing to write home about; no complaints.
The major problem was the nose. I've had this beer on draft form two different bars in Chicago and both times I could not finish even one pint. This beer has an overwhelmingly body-odor-like aroma. The smell was dense and lingering. All I could think about were the summers I've spent in crowded eastern european subways.
Generally I love FFF, but I will definitely not be drinking ZD again anytime soon. 471 characterszombiereview, Feb 09, 2013

Can I give a10 out of 5 for the smell of Zombie Dust!
This I'd the most addictive smelling brew I've ever had the pleasure of drinking! ( over and over). 
Color is just as it should be, nice head, smooth lines while drinking.
You can smell this beer from 5 feet away, and the smell is Citrus heaven.
Very flavorful, sharp grapefruit, oranges and hops. But not the smack down of sweetness you'd expect.
Finish is smooth as silk and begs you to buy some to take home!
Best overall tasting APA I've ever had!

The ale pours copper-amber with a thin, frothy off-white head, decent retention & excellent lacing, nice clarity. Aromas are a fruity, tropical nose with mango, pineapple, grapefruit, biscuity malt. Tastes are pineapple, mango, semi-pungent grapefruit rind, mild pine, biscuity malt, a touch of caramel, juicy, coats the palate, semi-dry fairly astringent on the finish. Pine-resiny, medium mouth-feel, nice juiciness. Overall, this is a superb American Pale Ale, but in my books Alpha King wins, but just by a little bit. I like the bready malt with more caramel. This seems to showcase the Citra hop more, while having a little less of a malt presence. 728 charactersbarnzy78, Feb 03, 2013

Taste is very much like the smell. Very sweet and fruity with hints of hay, pine and citrus. Balanced well toward sweet malts and hops, this one goes well with cheddar cheese. Feels light yet dense, nicely carbonated.

4.84/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Mmmmm...Zombie Dust, one of the legendary American Pale Ales, is miraculously served on tap quite regularly here at the University of Chicago's on campus bar, The Pub. I enjoyed a couple pints of this impossibly juicy hop nectar last Wednesday. Review is from notes. Served in a pint glass. 
Appearance (4/5): Minimal, 1/4 inch head due to a poor pour by a fairly incompetent bartender...but I digress. I'm sure the head would be luxuriant, bubbly, and white if there was one. Zombie Dust is copper-hued/light orange, clear, and visibly effervescent. Looks like just another pale ale. Nothing incredible about the appearance, but this isn't exactly a huge problem. 
Smell (4.75/5): The nose is enough to make any hop head cry tears of joy. It is extraordinarily fruity, juicy, and demonstrates all those grapefruit, passion fruit, and mango notes that distinguish intensely hopped ales. In the mix are your standard piney, resiny aromas, but the fruit notes steal the spotlight. Deep, dank, bold, pungent. Simply excellent. 
Taste (5/5): Super fruity, highly citrusy–grapefruit flavors tower above any other tasting notes. Zombie Dust=ruby red grapefruit delivery system. Zombie Dust is also quite dank. I must remark, the malt nicely compliments the hops and lends the beer good body. Additionally, I enjoy how the beer isn't intensely bitter; rather it is intensely (and enjoyably) fruity. This is a well-constructed APA that isn't totally out of balance. Probably the best tasting Pale Ale NOT named Hill Farmstead Edward I've drank. 
Mouthfeel (4.5/5): Nice tongue coating citric aftertaste and a long juicy grapefruit finish. Medium carbonation, medium body. Considerably more body and hoppiness than your average pale ale. 
Overall (4.75/5): Zombie Dust is one of those highly-hoppy American Pale Ales that's almost an IPA. Some people might get caught up in stylistic hair-splitting...that's not for me. This is a phenomenal tasting ale that beautifully showcases the power of Citra hops. It's juicy, dank, fruity, mildly bitter, and will flood your mouth with wave after wave of hop flavor. There's a reason why this a legendary ale. Reputation earned and confirmed. Boom. 2,187 charactershagbergl, Jan 30, 2013

Poured 12oz bottle into tulip glass with a 2in white head that settled fairly quickly and left some decent lacing on the glass. Color is a beautiful golden orange, slightly opaque. 
Aroma is super dank --resinous pine dominates with some citrus undertones 
Taste - huge grapefruit up front, some orange and lemon, a bit of malty sweetness, then comes a hoppy bitter (enjoyable) finish. 
Mouthfeel - medium carb and body, slightly sticky but remains crisp and refreshing
Overall - Has to be the best APA out there, but I feel like I enjoyed it more on tap. I can only assume this is fresh because there is no bottling date. 711 charactersmaxcoinage, Jan 30, 2013

Zombie dust pours a orange gold, fairly hazy, with a decent sized head that persists and laces. The aroma is delicious citrus hops, lemony, grassy. Not much on the malt side. Extremely complex given it's a single hop ale.
The taste follows the nose. Big citrus and grassy. Slightly sweet with a nice bitterness. A little bit of a sweet pale malt presence. The mouthfeel is medium, carbonation's on the low side. Really easy drinking. I'd consider this a true APA, as opposed to the disguised IPA that seems more common with the style these days.
I'm having trouble describing this beer, since it's so clean, simple and wonderful. More than the sum of its parts. You midwesterners who can get this regularly are very lucky indeed. 822 charactersCharlatanSin, Jan 27, 2013

Smell is unreal, big citrus, pine, west coast style hops, the best smelling beer I've ever had. Taste is as good as the smell, west coast hops, pine, lemon, tons of citrus, floral, so clean, so crisp, so amazing. Overall this beer is definitely worth a top ten rating, I have no idea how it is considered an APA, there is almost no Mal flavors and the hops dominate. This beer is pretty much perfect, if you can get it, buy as much as possible. No matter how many times I drink it, it never gets old. Just wish they'd sell it in Ohio. 614 charactersbrewtus, Jan 27, 2013
4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Drank 4 days fresh, poured into a a 12 oz tulip glass.
Appearance: Semi-hazy copper color, head is 2 fingers and pure white.
Smell: Pure Citra hops. Pine, floral, grassy, and clean.
Taste: Ahh, unlike so many beers whose smell's write checks their taste can't cash, ZD devliers full throttle. The Citra is in your face the whole way, with massive tasting and bittering hops. Almost no malt backbone to this one. No sweetness at all to speak of. If you hate Citra hops, this isn't the beer for you.
Mouthfeel: Clean, crisp, moderate to high carbonation, but still quite smooth. Very dry and leaves the palate craving more.
Overall: As close to perfect as you can get for this style. While I personally prefer an IPA with more body and a little more malt, the hop presence in this beer surpasses that of most IPAs, even DIPAs. I guess technically an APA, it'd be hard not to call this an IPA. If you like your IPAs dry, clean, crisp, and ultra-hoppy, you won't find better. 976 charactersMCain04, Jan 27, 2013

More head than a high school prom. Better smelling than any IPA I've had, and I live down the road from Russian River. 
Without all the BS, this is an amazing beer! It have everything that you want in an IPA.

Poured from a bottle, unknown freshness
A - Significant 3-4 inch head of foam on top of a transparent honey type color. Not much else to say, looks like it should.
S - just tons and tons of floral and citrus hops. Orange and lemon peels, grassy type notes, some really thick juicy type citrus in there as well. Really rich spectrum of smells without being overbearing.
T - Really awesome. Balance! Follows the nose almost exactly, without the grass notes. Basically, just see the smell description. Again, just great balance. Just exactly enough bitterness to make it crisp. This is awesome, you could drink about a million of these and keep enjoying.
M - Nailed it. Medium carb, really get presentation of the hop.
O - Pretty much lives up to the hype. It definitely deserves the top spot among pale ales, as it absolutely nails the style. 903 charactersBeerandboards, Jan 25, 2013

Poured into a standard tulip glass.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy, golden orange with a two finger slightly off white head. Tons of head retention and plenty of sticky lacing. Great looking brew!
Aroma: In your face Citra hops! Wow! Bright aromas of ripe peach, mango, juicy tangerine, lemon zest and pine with a subtle, sweet maltiness underneath it all. 
Taste: Loads of hops right up front, very similar to the aroma. Very tropical; peach, pineapple, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, and pine with a some what sweet, cracker-esque malt to round off this very hop-forward pale ale. Finishes dry and bitter, as any true pale ale should. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and robust, yet with just enough carbonation to be lively and refreshing. 
Overall A pitch perfect example of a west coast styled pale ale. The delicate and well balanced malt backbone of this pale ale really allows the new Citra hop varietal to really take flight and really showcase its many nuances. This is an incredible pale ale that really lives up to it's well deserved hype. Highly recommended. 1,081 charactersflayedandskinned, Jan 24, 2013

By the way, I claim coin to the word beerfreak since I haven't seen it used. This is a good one. Quite pricey at 20 a six, but well worth it. Okay, the citrus is there as it is with all hopsy beers, but it stays constant. The same peppery, citrusy flavor throughout. Its obvious since there is only one variety of hops used. Okay, hops aside, this is a carefully crafted brew that the owners of the recipe want to get right. I think they did it. The hops crafting is the feature of this brew, but there is no skimping on the brewing. Body, taste, head, and mouthfeel. I like it. Not an everyday drinker, but a special occasion one. Good job Floyd, Floyd and Floyd. 718 charactersmfanch8578, Jan 22, 2013

I had it on tap, cask and in the bottle. 
I was able to do a side-by-side tap vs. cask comparison. Below are my findings of this highly scientific research:
Zombie dust on bottle
While I couldn’t get a growler of Zombie Dust to go I did score a sixer of this wonderful elixir. 
It pours with a golden amber color and great foam. There’s a big bouquet on it of tropical fruit, pineapple and a lemony citrusy hop. The flavor is hoppy without being overpoweringly bitter with a crisp orange-lemony and pineapple floral notes coming across. Lightly bodied, this is all about the flavorful and aromatic hops. Loved it.
Zombie Dust on tap and in cask: a side-by-side comparison.
Tap: This has tight foam atop a clear golden tan color brew. The aroma is intensely hoppy and crisp with an amazing tropical citrusy hop aroma and a light note of toasted straw on the finish. There’s an upfront bitterness with some resin on it. Floral and citrusy with a hint of caramel sweetness and a dry finish.
Cask: It pours an amber-golden color with gloppy, sloppy bubbly foam. The aroma and flavor are both smooth, mellow, even. Warms well with citrusy notes prevalent with a great rounded smoothness. There’s an orange citrusy aroma, more mellow than tap but equally enjoyable. The flavor is likewise rounded and softened, with a smooth resiny/orange/orange peel and marmalade character to it.
Whether on tap or from the cask it is dangerously good and lives up to everything I’ve heard. 1,615 characterselNopalero, Jan 22, 2013

Floral citrus hops that waft up at you like candy. Piney grapefruit flavor, hits right on. Not as bitter as I had expected. Less carbonation than I was hoping for, and the finish comes off slightly syrupy. I guess I was expecting all hops. Strong malt profile here. That's a nitpick though, as the taste is all there and I love the citra hop aroma. All in all, a great pale ale. But given the (unfair) excitement over this one, it is a disappointment without a 5 rating. Very yummy stuff. 584 charactersBMMillsy, Jan 16, 2013

A - Golden with some slight haze. Orangish and yellow highlights depending on how you look at it. A massive white head with lots of fluff and huge stickiness on the walls of the glass. 
S - Big burst of citra hops is the first thing I noticed. Juicy hop aroma of both citrus and floral with an earthiness in the background. A big mixture of hop aromas throughout with a hint of sweetness.
T - more citra hops with the flavor. Massive citrus notes with grapefruit, orange and mango. Gushing citrus hops followed by some neat grassy pine like notes that tage along for the ride. A bit dreanaughtish really. Somewhat sweetish orange paired with some light caramel and pale malt. Hop bitterness is 2nd to none in this. Brilliantly balanced and a hop profile that's to die for. Semi dry finish that sort of fades out leaving a clean finish.
M - smooth medium body that has a flavor much bigger than what it really is. Coats the mouth like a world class beer should do and leaves you thirsting for the next sip. Smooth and thick mouthfeel in typical FFF fashion. 
O - Zombie Dust is one of the best beers I've ever had and it's for damn sure the best pale ale I've ever had. It has a massive flavor for its abv % and throws out notes you only get with the best double IPAs in the world. A remarkable feat if you ask me. It's as of a session Dreadnaught as you'll ever find. I just can't get over how stunning this ale is and the pure genius crafted into this. For me Dreadnaught is the World's best double ipa and this is of the same breed. I will buy this every single time I see it(I'm hoping it's often). It lives far beyond any hype you've read or heard. One of the brews with big expectations I've had and fulfilled all those expectations by blowing my mind. 1,968 charactersBradtheGreat7, Jan 16, 2013

Smell- immediately you're smacked by the aroma of freshly peeled grape fruit backed up slightly by the presence of pale malts, which combines to make it smell like that perfectly sweet grapefruit you're psyched to find at the supermarket.
Taste- citra hops are definitely the star of this show. A simple grain bill balances the hops perfectly and does nothing to stand in the way of the beautiful citra flavor. Sometimes less is more and the minimalist grain bill is a shining example of how successful this philosophy can be.
Mouthfeel- no problems gulping it down. What more do you want in a pale ale?
This is a great beer and will be even better enjoyed in the summer heat. Glad I live so close to munster. 804 charactersMalty_Matty, Jan 16, 2013

Crazy fresh citrus aromas like tangerine and blood orange, plus a little sage/resin, and a balanced malt sweetness. 
Flavors carry the same characters from the hops as the aroma. Malt backbone is a clean pale malt body plus a touch of something richer, maybe Munich or a gentle blend of light crystal malts. Great balance for all the hops.
Mouthfeel seems a little light, until I remind myself it's an IPA, not a DIPA. Carbonation plays well on the palate. Halfway through the bottle some hop oil stickiness starts around the edge of the tongue. 
Altogether an astonishingly delicious beer. The intensity of the hops reminds me of Pliny the Younger. The malt character is superbly crafted to balance the hops, with a touch of richness. Really well crafted. 864 charactersdfernandez77, Jan 13, 2013

S. Citrus hops dominate - from the smell of things one gets a sense that the taste will be phenomenal. Pineapple, orange, mango, etc. 
T. A quaffable, great tasting beer that does everything well. Very tropical upon entry with just enough malt to add balance without sweetness. Finishes long and crisp. Damn near perfect.
M. Low to medium bodied with good carbonation. 
O. For such a drinkable beer it is amazing how much flavor is packed into this stuff. I wish this was available in bottles around here - it would be a staple in my fridge. Well done, highly recommended. 645 charactersbound4er, Jan 13, 2013

Decanted into a Three Floyds teku glass, of course, yo, light copper-colored liquid, pale and slightly hazy, capped off with a foamy white head that seemed to last forever, and that left waves of soapy lacing on the glass. Juicy citra hops greet the nose, and pretty much take control of the aroma, though there are hints of a pale malt sweetness in the background. In the taste, again, hops are the dominant factor, as I would have expected, lots of orange zest and some pithy bitterness, biscuity malts taking the edge off slightly, keeping this on the fine line that separates IPA from APA. Body on the lighter side of medium, crisp and clean, and a tasty, drinkable treat. Nothing here that I haven't had before, and nothing really that screams "greatest APA in the world," but it's still a solid and tasty brew, will always be welcome in my fridge. 952 charactersRifugium, Jan 13, 2013

Backlighting brightens it up a bit and reveals some orange highlights. Good lookin’ stuff. It’s topped with an off-white head that rises to about two fingers in height. It’s very slow to recede. I’m not sure it will completely. Lacing is very sticky and thick. Leaves a really nice web of lace behind. 
Wow! This stuff smells delicious! Strong citric hop notes are apparent on the first whiff. I like that…a lot. Smells mostly like grapefruit and orange. There are some lighter notes of mango and pine that follow. While I’m pleased to report that there isn’t much caramel here, there is a good bit of toasted malt. It’s largely overshadowed by the strong hops. Alcohol is buried pretty well. I’m not getting much at all. This is one really aromatic American Pale Ale! Wow!
The flavor is equally as good as the nose. This stuff is delicious. The malt base tastes mostly like toasted malt. There might be a little caramel sweetness, but it’s extremely subtle. Hops are very strong and are easily the focal point. Classic Three Floyds. They have a strong citric flavor. Grapefruit, orange, and mango are all noted. There is a bit of pine, but it’s secondary. The malts do their best to provide some balance, but it still has a nice bitter kick. Excellent. Alcohol really isn’t noticeable. Finishes toasty with a blast of citric hops. 
The body is on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is dialed back nicely. This stuff is soft and smooth. It goes down like a dream. I could handle quite a few of these over the course of an evening.
Zombie Dust is undoubtedly excellent beer. I’m honestly shocked at how much flavor it has. The hop flavor really drives it into a class of its own. This really is the best American Pale Ale I’ve ever had. Wow! Find some. 1,853 charactersprototypic, Jan 13, 2013

Bottle Served into FFF Teku Glass. Finally I get to put the proper Beer in this glass.
Appearance: Pours a clear amber color with a good sized head that leaves a couple of streaky patches of lacing behind but nothing too substantial.
Smell: Faint smells of tropical fruit , with grapefruit, hints of lemon and mango
Taste: The bready malts up front and tropical fruits detected on the finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with crisp carbonation
Overall: Great APA/IPA with huge drinkability. I could see a six of this is easily being done in one night, but I would like to drink one a night through the holidays. Great first beer to any night. 665 charactersomniscientcause, Jan 11, 2013

Smell: Citra hops dominant…sweet smells of orange and grapefruit...heavy pineapple, sweet luscious pineapple…it’s alive and crisp and mouthwatering…pale and sweet malts help shape and round out the aroma, but this is sweet orange citrus through and through…(5/5)
Taste: Citrus (orange, lemon and grapefruit tasting) hops blending sweetly with pale malts from beginning to end…pineapple...for as citrusy as it is, the pale malts do a great job of balancing everything out…there is a degree of bitterness and floral hops lingering in the background…some floral after taste…(5/5)
Mouthfeel: Light, sweet and crisp…medium carbonation that fluffs a bit…mouthwatering…(4.5/5)
Overall: A fantastic ale…I hate hearing about how good a beer is before I try it, as the case here, but this brew lives up to the hype…the potent citrus flavor is balanced superbly by pale malts that could exist on their own and create a fantastic taste…it’s vibrant and light making it ultra drinkable…I could easily kill a sixer while playing poker or hanging out with friends…highly recommended, this will be an ale you’ll remember…(5/5) 1,287 charactersSerialHiker, Jan 11, 2013

Smell: Big juicy tropical fruit comes wafting out of the bottle. A pungent medley of pineapple, guava, mango, tangerine, and orange marmalade. There's also a touch of honey, a hint of peppery spice, some light floral notes and faint strawberry. I could smell this perfectly fine standing a good two feet from the glass. Easily one of the top 3 best smelling beers I've ever had.
Taste: Pulpy grapefruit, tangerine, sticky pine sap, and raw honey with a lightly toasted, nutty finish. Incredibly smooth with a nice hop bite.
Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied and well carbonated with a slick mouthfeel from the abundant hop oils. Crisp and tingly on the tongue with a semi-dry finish.
Overall, its easy to see why this wicked pale ale is always in such high demand. Currently at #7 in Beeradvocate's Top 250 Beers, this is truly a marvel. A big, bold, flavorful pale ale gushing with pungent fruity hops. It manages to be complex yet extremely smooth and well-balanced. There's really nothing I would change about this beer. It may technically be labeled an American pale ale, but for me it is the quintessential IPA. It also has one of the best names and label art of any craft beer out there. A beauty to behold. 1,317 charactersWolfsbaneBloom, Jan 10, 2013

Appearance- Hazy copper/orange color. Light white head with moderate lacing.

Taste- Supremely well balanced. The malt character plays with the hop bitterness perfectly. Grapefruit, orange rind flavors. 
Mouthfeel- So smooth and not overly carbonated at all. Slightly resinous, but pretty light in body

Pours a fairly dark but clear amber, large tan head with a rounded even cap. Looks great.
The nose is epic, huge grapefruit and orange citrus, bitter pine, a bouquet of other fruits and flowers. Incredibly juicy hop aroma.
Taste is equally amazing. The citrus hop in this is enormous, so much grapefruit and tangerine and mandarin orange, and just the right amount of piney bitterness. Not a lot of malt to speak of, just a light sweetness from the citrus to balance it out.
Drinkability is super good, lots of carb, big full body.
What an amazing beer!

The most fragrant Pale Ale I've ever experienced, there is a fruity hoppiness but its far more complex than just that. There's citrus scents; orange, mango, tangerine, lemon and melon. There's also some unusual aromas like flowers or perfumes and a touch of pine. The scent is absolutely incredible!
Zombie Dust is very piney on the tongue, like an IPA. There's a hint of honey, which is nice, and onion, which is off-putting. There's an earthy tone, must be the hops, but very little fruit. I can appreciate this for the complex nature in taste but the tastes are not my favorite complexities. 
The mouth is smooth and light but a bit metallic in the end.
I like this a lot but hoped the taste mimicked the smell and it never fulfilled that for me. 899 charactersKYGunner, Jan 05, 2013

A-beautiful clear copper. Looks great in my New Belgium globe. 
S-citrus, piney, but not overly pronounced like some APA/IPA's. Smells great.

M-smooth and coating, but not oily. 
O-this is a fantastic beer. I've lived 45 minutes from the brewery for 10 years and have just now found this. Picked up a case tonight after having it on tap last weekend. If you don't have it, trade for it. If you have it, relish it. If you can trade it, share. 692 characterskbrinson, Jan 05, 2013
4.12/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 12 oz. bottle; no freshness dating found. The ale poured a cloudy, deep golden with a sustained fluffy white-head.
Perhaps the best characteristic of this ale: pungent and fresh grapefruit aroma explodes from the bottle and also the glass. 
Given the aroma, one would expect a hop bomb in the mouth. This is not the case - the flavor does begin aggresively with the bittersweet, citrusy hop punch, but the ale also shows some sweet and spicy malt in the aftertaste. The flavor is very clean and refreshing if not very complex.
The ale has a medium body with a sleek, clean mouthfeel with a little too much carbonation. The lingering citra hop flavors coat the palate.
This is a very good American pale ale that I am pleased to finally try. Is it worth all the hype? I certainly enjoyed it, but it surprises me that its availability is so limited because of the high demand. The folks at Three Floyds certainly know how to market a beer.
An additional note on availability: if you live in the southern Indiana/Louisville, KY area, you can find some bottles at Bridge Liquors in New Albany, IN. They limit you to two bottles but at least they have it. Their major competitor in Clarksville, IN has this ale listed as "in stock" (even as I write this), but at 3 pm today they were sold out. 1,306 charactersjkrich, Jan 05, 2013

4.54/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle courtesy of a2rob who had stopped by FFF on the way to Madison. No bottling date. Poured into a Bell's snifter and quaffed two days ago, 4/13/2013. Have had quite a bit of previous experience with this beer both on tap and bottled.
Aroma: Lotta citrus in the form of freshly squeezed grapefruit and lemons. You can almost smell the acidity. It's balanced by some bready malty sweetness but it's almost entirely grapefruit here. Very appetizing nose that whets my thirst.
Colour: Pours a burnt orange body with a 2cm white head that takes more than a minute to dissipate into a thick white collar. Looks appetizing. The lacing is very thick and proliferates even more as I drink more of this nectar.
Flavour: I get tons of freshly squeezed grapefruit sweetness as well as the bitter acidity of citrus. That's pretty much what I get here, straight up with a background of honeyed bread sweetness, and the bitter kick of the grapefruit really delivers at the end. Not super complex (given it's pretty much a Citra-show) but very tasty and refreshing.
Mouthfeel: Typical of IPAs- lighter side of medium body, resinous and every surface that it comes into contact with is left with a stinging, bitter citrus juice sensation for a good half minute or so. It would be like drinking concentrated grapefruit juice with a sugar backbone I'd have to say. Finish is a bit dry although full of bitter citrus.
Overall: This is probably a fresh bottle but it's been 4 months since I had it fresh at the pub (which blew my mind) and took home a case which I've enjoyed very much. I think my palate's evolved quite a bit with all the imperial stouts and DIPAs I've had recently- beers with more malt backbone. This is a very drinkable IPA (I don't care if BA calls it an APA) that showcases the Citra hops and what it can do given a minimal malt backbone. Honestly, after having had more APAs/IPAs, this is definitely one of the best I've had. I think a lot of it is branding (this beer didn't sell well when it was known as Cenotaph), limited distribution (almost but not quite brewpub only) and an otherwise excellent beer. Regardless, I enjoyed drinking this beer so I can't take too much away from it. 2,205 charactersStevedore, Jan 02, 2013

The aroma has a lot of citrus and some balancing malts. The taste is similar to the aroma, with some more pronounced floral notes. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation, and is very smooth. The hops are present, but this beer is not very bitter and is clean and crisp.
Overall, a very nice APA from 3F, just wish I had access to more - it is high quality. 476 charactersmkotsayfan, Dec 31, 2012

Pale, chill-hazed gold in color, with a big cap of bone-white foam.
Aroma-big boquet of hops right out of the bottle-super fragrant juicy Citra hops- Amazing!
Taste-Big onrush of juicy citrus hops-white grapefruit with sugar, tangerine notes. A delicate malt bill just barely balances the equation, ending in a citrus-rind and slightly sweet/dry finish.
Outstanding hop aroma and flavor have this hop-head in head-over-heels love. Cries out for a spicy food pairing. A must try for all hop lovers. Embrace the undead! 559 charactershosehead83, Dec 30, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5One of the best beers i have ever had. Totally delivers on the reputation. 
Goods : Aroma, Taste, Feel, quaffability.
Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz bottle into snifter. Pale honey colored. Hazy. Few bubbles. Excellent lacing on the sides. Over one finger thick head of off white color. Decent standing. 
Aroma: Very strong citrus and flowery aroma. Some wild weed like and grassy. Aroma is so inviting and strong that it puts a lot of IPAs to shame. Grape fruit, piney hops are dominant. 
An aroma so strong that it mesmerizes you and never fades. 
Taste: Very solid bitterness. Not overly bitter but gives a punch nonetheless. Strong mango presence. Built up on a good malt backbone that keeps the final bitterness totally at bay. Very well balanced example of craft brew. 
Mouth feel : Smooth and without any astringency. Extremely easy beer to drink. Moderate carbonation, makes me have some burrps. Very oily and herbal mouth feel. Medium to slightly light body. 
This is one beer that invites you to try it as soon as you pop open the bottle and then embraces you into its arms and takes you on a ride to wonderland. A brew i can drink all day without any issue and i would love to do so. So easy in fact that i drank 4 bottles in a go out of my first six pack. And that was when i have had tasting of over 30 beers of super high ABVs. Just pretty well done brew that is the epitome of craft brewing. Very solid aromatics at display and an equally good flavor.

A- Pours a slightly hazy honey colored body with a generous off-white head that has some nice thick lacking.

T- Mango, citrus, caramel malt, and a subtle bitter hoppyness on the finish. Good balance. Finishes smooth.

Date: None on bottle
Glass: Standard US pint glass
Zombie Dust is one beer that I feel lives up to the hype. There's an incredible amount of hoppiness compacted in this pale ale base, making this "extra pale ale" quite special if you like the taste of hops (and, in particular, Citra hops). The price is also quite decent at $12 per six-pack. After tasting this beer, I've realized that the concept of rating is worthless. While this is an excellent result of artistry, inspiration, and brewery production management science, it's not an APA that I'd want to drink all the time: Daisy Cutter, Burning River, St. Lupulin, and SN Pale Ale are all other staples I enjoy for other reasons (flavors, aromas, densities). I also need to thank the beer staff at Binny's South Loop for connecting me with their last six-pack from their personal stash, it was really much appreciated.
Pours a tall, 2.5cm head of off-white to beige foam that consists of small and medium-sized bubbles, with above average retention, lasting over two minutes. Head eventually falls to a thick ring around the glass and a large island of wispy residuum atop the beer's body. Lacing left is moderate: a few large random splashes of foam along the glass' perimeter. Body is a deep copper orange, mostly transparent, with mildly active carbonation. Light brings out the body's orange tints and brightens them substantially.
This beer is intensely aromatic, Three Floyds has likely taken the idea of pre-boil, post-boil, and dry hopping to new levels with this beer. The beer smells remarkably similar to an open packet of Citra hop pellets (with all that grapefruit, pineapple juice, mango, and hints of peach) mixed with fresh pale malt wort. In general, the smells tell you, "this is really deep and dank stuff."
Zombie Dust is a pale ale for someone who has a taste for citrus-inspired hops. The flavors are huge and sweet, full of citrus fruit salad that's been lightly touched with malt extract. Tasting opens with sweet pale malt base and hints of sweetened pineapple and grapefruit juice. Mid-palate is where the hop flavors truly shine, bringing out sweetened grapefruit juice, pineapple, mango, kiwi, and hints of peach, all with a medium-intensity bitterness. Back of palate picks up grapefruit, Meyer lemon rind, pineapple juice, and mango with modest bitterness. Aftertaste is quite bitter, with grapefruit and mildly sweet pineapple juice being the major flavors.
Beer is medium-light in body, with superbly gentle carbonation that never feels fizzy, but still manages to foam the beer up on the palate. The result is a smooth, foamy mouthfeel that's as enjoyable as the aromas and flavors. Closes quite dry, with little residual stickiness across the palate, which invites taking another sip. 2,819 charactersfalloutsnow, Dec 29, 2012
4.53/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512 ounce bottle, this just came to the store yesterday afternoon so I'm hoping it's a fresh batch. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about an inch frothy off-white head that stays around for a very long time. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice and hoppy, it smells mostly like citrusy hops (grapefruit, mango, tropical fruits), along with pine hops, orange peel, and some light bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some floral/earthy hops noticeable, and a nice lingering bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit sticky, but also very smooth with moderate carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew, I know I'd buy this again if I came across it. $10.99 a six pack and worth every penny! 787 charactersbluejacket74, Dec 29, 2012

Pours a beautiful transparent golden with a huge eggshell white head that doesn't dissapear and leaves extremely thick lacing. Perfection on the eye candy. The aroma is a controlled blast of sweet fruits. Lots of mango, grapefruit, peach, papaya, grass, pine resin. The aromas don't exactly smack you in the face, but are spot on and sweet like candy. Very floral. The flavors are bittersweet. Lots of fresh orange peel, pineapple, more grapefruit and pine resin. Finishes somewhat dry, but has a little juice to it. Very earthy flavors. The mouthfeel is unique and wonderful. It's just about perfect. The carbonation is active, and the body is light but creamy and fluffy. The mouthfeel really makes this beer extremely quaffable. Alcohol goes unnotices and leaves you wanting another. Dank.
The craftsmanship to this beer is second to none. It's an extremely well done beer. I don't look at it is as the "end all, be all" of IPAs, but it doesn't have to be. The way this beer is crafted makes it an automatic winner. It's a definitely a magical treat that I would enjoy anytime. Extremely well done. 1,210 charactersBB1313, Dec 28, 2012

I'd heard so many positive things about it, so I'm quite excited to finally be able to review this. It has a dark honey pour, very slightly cloudy with a thin foam head and very fine lacing. Scent of grapefruit, pine, earthiness, and more mellow citrus. So far nothing particularly out of the ordinary. Upon first sip, I figure out what its all about. Extremely well balanced combination of hops and malts that continue to mellow out in the aftertaste. I taste a hint of caramel in the aftertaste too, a really fantastic brew. Mouthfeel is perfect, light carbonation and a certain heaviness to it. Highly recommended! 661 characterssrv33, Dec 26, 2012

T- One of the most well-balanced hoppy beers I have had the privilege of tasting (seems like more than just a "pale ale" though). Tons of citrus (grapefruit) and hops blend with the malt; combined with the floral/earthy notes, this is one hell of a beer!
O- I am so glad I was able to try this. Only wish I had more than one bottle. Hopefully I will land more in a trade soon. ZD is definitely one of the best hoppy beers I have tried, and easily stands up beside Pliny and Heady.

It reminds me a lot of the Laughing Dog citra hop ale they did for Capital Ale Houses 10th anniversary. "I wish it were winter, we could make it into ice blocks and skate on it! And then melt it in the spring time and drink it!" Yeah, wish I had more than a sixer. 555 charactersmadtrixter787, Dec 22, 2012

T - the hops are in your face... Earthy/oniony to start, with a little hint of some malty sweetness in between before the citrus hops finish it off... They obviously wanted the hops to be the primary target, so the malt character was left very basic and minimal
M - vibrant, not harsh... Almost perfect amount of carbonation for an ipa

4.77/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5I was very excited to finally try this beer. It lives up to my expectations.
Appearance: A nice orange- light copper with a white one finger head and some good lacing.
Aroma: Very hoppy. Grapefruit, pine, pineapple, tangerine, mango, and a little floral.
Taste: Very similar to the aroma. Tropical fruits and pine. A little bit of caramel-toasty malt. The malt becomes a bit stronger as the beer warms, but the hops dominate heavily all throughout. 
Mouthfeel: Median bodied and carbonation. The finish is a little dry and hops bitterness lingers shortly. Very easy to drink.
Overall: This is a great hoppy pale ale. It leans more of an IPA. Tons of flavors. I really enjoyed Zombie Dust and something I will happily have again. 733 characterszrbeer1579, Dec 21, 2012

It has truly been a pleasure getting to try this beer, and I've been lucky enough to be able to travel to this brewery twice in the past few months.... I can't sing their praises enough.
A&S: beautiful opaque deep copper colored beer. Layers of foamy white lacing, head stays in a thin layer on the top. Powerful citrus (peeled orange) and floral (lemon grassy) scents. Sight tropical and grapefruittyness to it as as well.
T&M: Not super complex, but quite a knock out as far as a bold tasting brew. Taste is very similar to the smell only more citrus. The finish is splendidly bitterness, clean, and dry. Body is medium and carbonation is mild.
overall: Easily the best pale I've ever had, I couldn't think of a better beer to relax with on a late spring/early fall. All the extras with this beer are nice as well: great bottle design and name. 950 charactersminterro, Dec 19, 2012

The aroma of this beer, for lack of a better term, is fucking amazing. As soon as you open the bottle, a surge of fruit and hops jumps out at you. You dip your nose to the glass and it bum-rushes your nostrils like no other. JAM PACKED with all kinds of fruits; tangerines, oranges, grapefruits, papaya, pineapple. The description of the beer on the bottle is very accurate - this beer's aroma is GUSHING with citrus. It's incredible. The citrus is outlined with an incredible hop portrait; resinous, piney, oily, slightly floral and dank. Perfect aroma for a pale ale.
At this point, I'm just hoping that the smell doesn't get my hopes up so high only to be let down by the taste. It doesn't - this beer delivers, HARD. The hops are more up front in the taste than they were in the aroma, and it works perfectly. You're still getting the incredible citrus on the nose and the extra hops on the tongue - perfect harmony and synthesis of the senses. Bitter spikes and oily and resinous hops take over for a bit, mellowed out by the grapefruits, tangerines, pineapples, and mangoes in the background. 
The hops round out a bit as the beer warms up, and the citrus flavors evolve even more. This beer is seriously insane, one of the best things I've ever tasted. Little malt and yeast on the very tail end. Not much, but really, when your hop profile is this amazing, it doesn't leave much of one to be desired. Just a phenomenal flavor and aroma profile that synthesize extraordinarily well. Medium body, medium-high carbonation, ever so slightly sticky.
Good lord. After I had a Pliny the Elder, I thought I'd never have another hop-forward beer better than it. I take that back. Pliny is damn good, but Zombie Dust is goddamn incredible. Literally, a PERFECT combo of bitter and sweet, hops and citrus, every sip blows my mind all over again. And that nose... my GOD that nose. Unbelievable. Whether you consider this a PA or an IPA doesn't matter - just know that it's an amazing beer. If I could get my hands on this easily, I would drink it all day, until the day I died. All hail the Citra hop, all hail motherfuckin' Zombie Dust.
EDIT: 4/3/2013
Finally received some more of this after putting it off for so long (thanks MCain04). I was afraid this time around that it wouldn't be as good. I was worried that maybe I had hyped it up to myself before and that I was overrating it big-time. I was scared that my palate had changed and Zombie Dust would no longer be the same sweet nectar I fell in love with the first time around. Luckily all of my worries were wiped away the second I cracked open the bottle, took a nice whiff and had another sip. This stuff is simply amazing. So perfectly balanced and so insanely drinkable. All things considered, this is still one of THE best beers out there, in my opinion. 3,037 characterstectactoe, Dec 15, 2012

Three Floyds makes a damn good beer, but their cocky attitude at the brewpub multiple times left me boycotting for awhile. Alas, I gave in on a sixer the other day.
A- About 1 finger worth of head, and a moderate amount of lacing. A pale goldenrod color that is translucent. 
S- Definitely smell sweet mango, with some subtle grapefruit and tangerines hints at the end. Also smell some light malt that really complements the mango.
T- First thing I taste is bitter pine, which leads to grapefruit to mango. It seems to go from bitter to sweet, and ends nicely with some light malty goodness. 
M- High carbonation that stings the tongue, but not too overwhelming. Medium bodied.
O- A damn good beer. However, I believe it smelled better than it tasted. I feel like the pine overwhelmed the citrus flavors. But it is Three Floyds, they love their bitter hops. Lives up to the hype. 968 charactersEfay, Dec 13, 2012

T - the tropical fruits come through with all of the aforementioned smells present in flavor-form; mango; grapefruit; pineapple; sweet pine deliciousness
M - this is pretty carbonated and dry; medium finish; smooth and buttery; hotdamn it's silky and amazing
O - stands up to its reputation; I've recently had Dreadknaught and Apocalypse Cow and while both of those have significantly more heat, Zombie Dust takes the cake with balance, flavor, and pale ale (IPA) perfection.

A - Poured a slightly hazy, apricot color that had some nice gold hues when held to the light. An off-white, 2 finger head formed and retained nicely. Some nice lacing was left along the glass
S - Really bright, fruity aromas right from the start. Big notes of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, honeydew mellon, and lots of lemon/citrus notes. Sweet biscuit and caramel malts provide a background for these sweet fruit aromas. There's a bit of pine on the backend of the nose too.
T - Tropical fruits all over the place! Fresh, bright flavors of mango, grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine and lemon right up front. A bready, caramel, biscuit malt stands up nicely with the fruit notes of the flavor profile. Some resin and some slight bitter pine is present as well adding nicely to the flavors here.
M - Medium bodied beer that at times is slightly on the lighter side. Slightly dry finish to this one. Medium level of carbonation.
O - Really stellar sessionable pale ale. The flavors are what I want in a hop forward beer all the time. Glad I got to try this one. Hope to get some more sometime soon! 1,231 charactersKAP1356, Dec 07, 2012

T - The front end is intense with a citrusy hop filled burst that finishes clean and smooth. Taste, that lives up to the smell.
M - Light-Medium bodied with a bite of carbonation. Very drinkable but too many will wreck your pallet.

A - Pours a clear orangish gold with about an inch off white head; very appetizing.

T - Upon fist sip, I get hops as expected with an undead pale ale but right after; grapefruit and a sweet fruitiness followed by a strong flavor of Citra hops. dry finish. Really reminds me of a dryer version of Gumballhead.
M - just what you'd want, it goes down smooth. Not really good at describing mouthfeel.
O - This is my favorite pale ale.Probably the BEST pale ale far as taste and balance goes. I love the citrus that offsets the dryness. Its not overly bitter that its smacks you, or ruins your taste-buds for the night. It's a really balanced and really refreshing pale ale.

it finishes with a strong dry hop

4.05/5  rDev -10.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.7512 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap (and nice art, for that matter) served into a Uinta brewing pilsner glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are through the roof given its current ratings and the hype surrounding it. I believe this is my first purely Three Floyds review - though I did have the Boogoop collaboration. No visible bottled on date. 
Served straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm slightly over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 
Paired with salted pretzels.
Some foam ballooned out when I opened it, but there wasn't any upsurge of beer or anything. It might be a bit overcarbonated. 
A: Pours a three finger luscious beige colour head of nice cream and thickness, and good retention. Body colour is a hazy copper-gold. Vibrant and appealing. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. 
Sm: Delightful floral hops and some lemon citrus twang. Grapefruit. Lemongrass, lemon zest. Hints of pine. Pale clean malts. A good balance of floral and citrus hop notes. I'm excited to try it, but the aroma itself isn't blowing me away. A moderate strength aroma, and a pleasant and fresh one. 
T: Delightful floral hops throughout, but with an underlying soapy hint (maybe a bit too long spent in primary?). It's a minor issue, but it does distract. Some pleasant grapefruit and lemon citrus esters introduce themselves mid-second act and hang around through the climax. Pale malts provide the clean, unobtrusive foundation - letting the hops take the forefront but also giving a bit of sweetness to hide the hop bitterness. I actually get a bit of alcohol warmth in the stomach - shocking at its mere 6.40%, but I'd consider this a pleasant warming sensation in the winter. Hints of a candi sugar like sweetness beneath the surface. It's very nicely balanced and rather refreshing. Delightfully built. I'm not blown away by its complexity, but it's well put together and succeeds within the style. I get no yeasty notes. A bit too much buttery character on the finish. 
Maybe I expect a hoppy character on par with a good IPA, but I have to remember it's a pale ale. It's a masterfully brewed one at that, but I do think there's room for more complexity within the style. 
Mf: Chewy, smooth, soft, wet. Carbonation and thickness are ideal. Good presence on the palate. Has enough body to present its flavours. Refreshing. Slightly oily. Even a touch buttery - too much so on the finish. 
Dr: Probably its best attribute is its high drinkability. I could down this one all night. Dangerously drinkable. It's a great pale ale - amongst the best I've had - but I have to admit I expected more given the hype. It's not a perfect beer as its current 100 rating might suggest. It doesn't hide its relatively modest ABV all that well, and it doesn't bring the complexity I think a perfect beer in this style would. I'm glad I got to try it and I'd definitely have it again - preferably fresh on draught. I want another already. Wow. I can't wait to try more beers from Three Floyds. 
Constructively, I will say that its main flaw is that it uses a buttery quality to hide the hop bitterness on the finish. It works here, but lacks the seamless subtlety of more masterful brews. A great example of the style would integrate its hop bitterness as a positive characteristic. It's tough to do here because this is a pale ale with the hoppiness of an IPA but not enough of a malty backbone. I appreciate the experimentation within the style, but with some work this could be truly amazing. 
B+
Best consumed sans food, or perchance with some unsalted pretzels or bread. 
Serve cold. 
A poor candidate for aging. Drink fresh.
----
Taking some more notes on this having received a bottle from the gracious Duff27 in a trade. 
A: Pours a soft appealing frothy head of good cream. Body colour is a vibrant pale copper. Appearance is good for the style, but not special or unique. 
Sm: Hoppy and bready, with hop character of juicy citrus, light grassy character, grapefruit, lemon zest, light pine, and heavy floral character. It's a bit murky yet still fresh; maybe it's a bit too grassy. Pleasant. I don't get any yeast or alcohol.
T/Mf: Juicy bursts of refreshing citrus hop notes and nectary character. Ideal crisp pale malt foundation. Smooth and wet. Very refreshing and pleasant to drink - a highlight of the beer. Delightfully well balanced and built, with impressive subtlety for the style. Not as grassy as the aroma. Clean. Good carbonation. It's not biting or sharp. Hop-forward without being too assertive or overbearing; they packed a lot of flavour in here. 
Dr: Extremely high. I could easily chug this. Very impressive. I could stick with this all night and never grow tired of it. Quite delightful. This was definitely more fresh than the first bottle I reviewed.

Smell: Intense, multi-layered hop bouquet that punches you in the face. The smell is almost sour, if you will, from the intense concentration of hops. This is just a pale ale eh? Phhh.
Taste: Definitely matches the nose. Upfront you're hit with grapefruit and citrus. The end cuts out nicely. A dry, bready finish gives way to a bit of lingering bitterness that just agrees with the tongue and proceeds to smoothly be unnoticeable. The unique, initial hopsmack you get in the beginning is pretty cool compared to the dry, restrained finish.
Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, the hops attack your tongue and can't be forgotten, moreso than most mere pale ales.
Overall: A good beer that in my opinion tastes very similar to Pliny The Elder. Sessionable as hell, and tasty to boot. Would drink again. 897 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Dec 01, 2012

Pours deep gold with good clarity and a small, cream colored head that settles fairly quickly. Clingy patches of lace stick to the sides of the glass. 
Huge, hoppy citra aroma and flavor; very little sweetness; dry finish; lots of lingering bitterness. Fresh pine, citrus, pineapple, mild oniony, catty note beneath, super juicy. Minimal malt presence, just the slightest dry, bready backbone.
Medium body, medium, somewhat lively carbonation but retains a level of creamy smoothness as well. Terrific mouthfeel and simply terrific overall; does a lovely job of balancing intricate hoppy flavor with just the right amount of bitterness; the latter never overwhelms the tastiest aspects of the beer.

The pour gives a lot of head and a cloudy, burnt orange pour. The smell is fruit forward. Juicy fruit gum comes to mind with a wallop of hops thrown in. Taste is similar, but comes with a chaser that I associate with Libby's Fruit Cocktail. medium in body and carbonation, easy drinker.

12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.
A: A very golden, clear color. The head is a light tan, which pours thick and lessens to a lingering half-inch.
S: As I was pouring it the smell hit me in the face. Lemon grass, citrus, and some tropical fruit notes including some definite pineapple.
T: Lemon, grapefruit, pineapple. Pretty bitter, which forces me to sip it. Prefer it that way because I want to savor it.
M: Light, mildly carbonated.
Overall: This was well worth the hype. Had a friend ship me two bottles and he advised I drink them quick. The citrus hops are awesome and this beer really makes me wish I could just go to Indiana and taste it off tap. 686 charactersRoose13, Nov 21, 2012

A- Orange lemon in appearance. Slight haze. Head lasts a long time. 
S - Citrus ... all  grapefruit citrus with a little malt sweetness  and cut grass .to the smell. Overall,  it makes the mouth water and anticipate the beer to come.
T - Starts out malt sweet, but citrus and hops rush the taste buds. All I can say about this is mmmm.
M - Juicy mouthfeel, perfect carbonation.
O - An excellent beer and example of the APA style. Three Floyds has nailed it. 501 characterscreepinjeeper, Nov 20, 2012

A- pours a very slight amber golden that's almost clear but not just quite. A very light touch of tan that pours two fingers deep that lingers.
S- best smelling beer I've ever put my nose in. Big time pineapple, grapefruit, light lemon grass. It's like shoving your nose into a fresh ripe just picked hop cone.
T- Grapefruit pineapple, and grassy notes make this beer very refreshing. The bitterness is present but just flows across the mouth prefectly with the beer.
M- light/medium body with a great medium carbonation that just barely sears the taste buds leaving them aching for more.
O- This beer is just simply great, I would really like to experience another American pale ale that can battle up to the zombie dust. Prefectly balance very American flavor forward craft beer. 847 charactersKeyportnick, Nov 20, 2012

Appearance- Creamy layer of head that fades into a thin, eventually-dissolving ring. Head returns willingly with some swirling. Beautiful orange hue is incredibly appetizing. Very nice looking beer. 
Smell- Orange zest, lemon rinds, sweet malts, and citra hops. 
Taste- Juicy hop fruits explode onto the palate. These are balanced nicely by a nice sweet malt backbone that goes toe-to-toe with the hops. I keep expecting a bitter edge at the end, but it doesn't come. I'm not sure if this is super fresh, but I like it all the same (I love beers with assertive hops and malt bases to back them up). 
Mouthfeel- Pitch perfect carbonation levels and the beer rolls around the mouth in a creamy fashion.
Overall- Great beer. Amazing for the style, and I could drink probably 20 in a session (although maybe not at over 6%). 903 charactersAuror, Nov 17, 2012

Heavy hop aroma of floral and strong grapefruit notes. A good dose of sweet malt seems to detract from the hops though.
Lots of bitterness initially which fades to reveal some citrusy hop flavor and finishes with a sweet bready malt character. 
Ok, not sure about this one. Can't see any date on the bottle so going to go with this. Would be happy to give it another shot but wasn't too impressed with this first try. 526 charactersjoecast, Nov 15, 2012

12 oz bottle poured into a beer mug.
A: Pours an intensely cloudy orange-copper color. The head is a one finger white color with some fantastic retention - it's been about a minute and the head is still there
S: There's no doubt this zombie is but a shadow of its former self, though it has held up well enough to be pretty good. This has a lot of papaya, mango, and honeydew melon, along with a piny brightness. I also detect a very subtle sweetness to it.
T: Extremely good for a six month old pale ale. Most of the bitterness is midpalate; the opening flavors are melony and sweet, while the finish is wonderfully neutral and bready. Nonetheless, this offers a decent melange of tropical fruits. If only it were fresh *sigh*...
M: This feels a LOT lighter than it looks, and goes down with amazing ease. Carbonation is perfect for what this beer is, perhaps a hair too light. The finish is surprisingly wet, likely due to the (un)dead hops. 
O: I really like it - but it pains me to review it in this state, given the circumstances. On the plus side, I could really see this being one of my favorite beers EVER fresh, so needless to say, I'll be on the hunt for fresh bottles of this! 1,299 charactersThisWangsChung, Nov 12, 2012

Pours a slightly hazy orange with a nice white head. Smell is tropical - mango, papaya, maybe a touch of a fruit cocktail syrup. A bit of grapefruit as well. Taste follows the nose mostly with the grapefruit and a bit of the tropics. There's also a really nice caramelly malt note on the finish that wasn't too noticeable on the nose. Ends with some really pleasant bitterness that invites you to take another drink. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with enough carbonation to keep it EXTREMELY refreshing. The beer absolutely lives up to the hype. Has enough complexity and intensity to keep it interesting while being refreshing enough to quaff. Can't get enough of this beer. 713 charactersThurgoft, Nov 10, 2012

Given the pedestal my beer friends puts this beer upon, I was a initially underwhelmed when I finally had a full pint in front of me. The beer was surprisingly clear and lacking in the nice creamy head I was expecting. The first fruity, citrusy whiff put those fears to bed, however. Delicious hoppy goodness with bits of orange peel. The taste follows with a nice hop punch and tastes of grapefruit. Just awesome! This embodies the smooth, fruity IPA/AIPAs that I love. Really great stuff that is not to be missed if you have the opportunity. 580 charactersClarkHimself, Nov 09, 2012

A. Pours 3 fingers of big foamy head. Thick lacing. Good retention. Color is a hazy brownish shade of orange. 
S. Massive hop smell for a pale ale. Nice crisp citrusy hop aroma. This is one of the hoppiest pale ales I have smelled. A bit of dry biscuity malt that I find in most of 3F's beers lies beneath all the hop aroma. To be honest there are a lot of IPAs that don't smell this good. Grapefruit, and another citrus fruit that I can't quite put my finger on dominate.
T. Taste is very hop forward as well with an almost mouth coating bitterness. Get that almost classic orange marmalade flavor that only a few of the best IPAs can pull off. 
M. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Lingering bitterness.
O. A beer that crosses the boundaries between APA and IPA. Who really cares though as long as it tastes good. This beer definitely tastes good. Wish I had easy access to this as a year round staple in my fridge. 3 Floyds does excellent hoppy beers, and Zombie Dust is no exception. 1,035 characterssiradmiralnelson, Nov 08, 2012

The many bubbles and one finger cottony white head also make it a beauty to look at. The head retention was amazing as there was some foam all the way to the end of the glass. Lastly, ZD left some very nice lacing down the glass. This is a very attractive beer.
From the aromas I could only detect hops. Grapefruit, pepper, and as the beer warmed grass are what it offered to my olfactory nerves. I really enjoyed this aspect all the way to the bottom of the glass as the aromas did not trail off at all.
The flavors are very much like the aromas, bitter grapefruit, pepper with not as much grass in the flavor profile as the aroma but it was present. 
ZD is a medium bodied beer that offers quite a bitter and resinous hop punch right off the bat. It's the real sticky kind of feel that makes you want to pucker up and it is amazing. It finishes more dry and with the pepper notes and leaves a bit of a citrus aftertaste.
What a fantastic beer. I do not live in the distro are for ZD but if I did it would be a staple in my fridge. I will buy this beer whenever I have the opportunity. 1,153 charactersJCaweinstein, Nov 08, 2012

A: Translucent golden honey color with a small white head that dissipates quickly but lingers in a ring for a while after. It is cloudy but not too cloudy with floaters or anything, great start.
S: Lots of tropical fruit melons peach and others it is almost overwhelming but I love it. I cannot smell much else but that is the only downside i can see.
T: The taste definitely follows the nose lots of melony and fruity flavors. The hops aren't as up front as I like but there is a subtile bitterness that lets you know they are still there. I am kind of surprised with the lack of balance, but I still really like it so its not all bad.
M: Very smooth and easy to drink, but pretty light for my liking especially in terms of a pale ale not bad by any stench of the imagination though.
O: I like it I really do, but it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. Definitely will get again, but I'm not going to make it a priority. Though one of the best pale ales I have ever had for sure. 1,031 charactersPinknuggets, Nov 05, 2012
4.09/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Let's just get this right out of the way.  There's no beer on this planet that actually measures up to the hype surrounding it within the Internet beer community.  None.  And this is no exception.
Zombie Dust is a good pale ale with a massive consistency issue, much like many other Citra brews.  Working in a liquor store, I've had this stuff many, many times.  It almost never tastes the same.  I took a year+ break from drinking it, thinking that absence would make the heart grow fonder, but my most recent brush with Dust left me scratching my head as to why this earns such high marks.  There are simply far better pale ales out there, and even more that offer greater consistency in flavor.  Y'all can keep it. Alpha King whips the dirt off of it, yet people sure aren't beating themselves up to buy it like this one. 825 charactersBigJim5021, Nov 05, 2012

A: 1 finger of white sticky tight head with good retention. Hazy orange-gold liquid with green tint. Pretty, though greenish tint is a bit off-putting. Nice head.
S: Tropical fruit and honey. Man candy. Mango, grapefruit. I'd like a bit more diversity in the aroma.
T: Lots of grapefruit up front and in the finish. Quite a palate wrecker! Some loos esters in the finish rattle around and don't quite jive - a negative. Slight malt framework. West coast style all the way! :-)
M: Round start and bitter finish. Quite puckering. Very dry end.
O: An enjoyable APA that is firmly in the IPA or session IPA territory. If we call it a session IPA, it's the best I've had of the class to date (will have to check my rating on All Day IPA). Big thanks to warnerry for the bottle! I would love another and will buy 6 next time I see it. 853 charactersdfillius, Oct 28, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5There’s really no denying that is an exceptional apa. It’s got 3Fs flair for sure, and nearly on par with Alpha King. Aroma is an A+. Tons of big, juicy, tropical citrus fruits, subtle pine, and vibrant florals. More tropical fruit here than usual 3Fs. It’s so hop fruity, but balanced with sweeter melon fruit, caramel, and cereal grains. The pour is decent, semi-translucent with a golden body, and fluffy creamy, starch white head. The body is light-medium (for a 3Fs product), big on flavor, though not quite perfectly balanced. Less of the great tropical fruit compared to the nose, but more lemon grass, strawberry, and melon starburst candy. Also, caramel and malted cereal with some light soapy qualities. Finish lingers very well with more florals and citrus. I definitely liked alot, but maybe not quite on par with Alpha King, though that is definitely debatable. 880 charactersSamichlaus82, Oct 24, 2012

Had both on-tap, fresh at the Brewpub, on-tap in cold fall air-chilled kegs during Dark Lord Day, and ~50 bottles. Same story from all of them.
Appearance is a light bronze/honey color with plenty of carbonation and a creamy-looking head. The smell is of grapefruits and oranges, and the infamous Citra hop, the only hop this brew is made with, refreshing. Taste follows the nose. Absolutely refreshing, clean, crisp, citrus fruit taste, with more pineapple, orange, and an alcohol sweetness coming into play as it warms. Clean, smooth, almost milky mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation keeps it light and highly drinkable. The hype is real on this, and in my opinion, it truly is the best APA on the market. Just swung by the brewery again to pick up another case of 24. Too good to pass up. 875 charactersTrifecta1, Oct 23, 2012

The nose is pretty outstanding all of the whiffs for what comes next...Citrus galore, grapefruit, orange, lemon zest and you get a bit of balance with some apricot and mango notes. The finish is nice and soft. Carbonation is medium. Fantastic beer there are some lucky folks who live near this brewery! 376 charactersjimmy82063, Oct 21, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I've had people say that this beer is better than Pliny and really talk this up quite a bit.
Well, the citra hops are clearly in play here. Strong hop presence. Good bitterness. I wish that the flavor profile would last a bit longer, honestly. It hits, and it's nice, but it definitely doesn't last as long as I'd like; or as long as it should, really. 
In the grand scheme of things, it's a very nice beer. Brings some punch, but doesn't go overboard. I suppose that's what a pale ale is supposed to do. 
I can't say that it's better than Pliny, off what I'm having here. (It's dipa vs. apa and apples vs. oranges). But it's a good beer. I'll have to try it on bottles one day. 681 charactersRblWthACoz, Oct 20, 2012

4.54/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Served on-tap in a clear waisted glass at The Publican (Chicago, IL).
A: Medium-amber with soft 1/2-finger cap of foamy light beige head with good retention and plenty of lacing.
S: Explosive nose of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and passionfruit with big floral aromas as well. There is some resiny components as well. The maltiness plays second fiddle.
T: The flavor is very hoppy but not astringent and just moderately bitter which allows the big fruity pineapple, grapefruit, and mango notes be maximally enjoyed. The maltiness provide more crystal sweetness, although it is very light, like 20L, along with a fair dose of Munich to supply some light breadiness. I agree that this tastes more like an APA, but it is very aggressively hopped for aroma and flavor with a restrained bitterness.
M: Incredibly drinkable with a moderately dry finish along with light-to-medium body and soft carbonation to give a creamy and lighter than expected feel.
O: A wonderful beer that I was very glad to get a chance to try on-tap. It drinks right on the edge of APA-IPA styles but feels more like a hefty APA than a light IPA, although neither of those would be wrong. A superb beer and I was surprised to find out it was brewed exclusively with Citra -- need to try brewing one of those soon! 1,290 charactersargock, Oct 17, 2012

I really like this beer, but don't understand the hype.  It's good, no doubt, but it's not even the best pale ale it its region.  Pseudo Sue and Lizard King are better examples in my opinion.
Taste is individual, so this is not one I seek, but I do enjoy it.   I do find myself fpicking this up for friends, so it's clearly very desirable for them. 430 charactersssimpson89, Oct 13, 2012

S- Citrus at first following by tropical fruits as it warms slightly. By far the best nose on a beer that I have ever experienced.
T- Citrus burst on the front end followed by tropical fruits just like the nose. Finishes extremely clean despite the huge hop wallop it packs. Again, this beer is spectacular and at the top of its class.
M- Thinner mouthfeel which can be a positive or negative depending on how you look at it. It is very approachable unlike some hop bombs. I appreciate it because it doesn't leave my tongue feeling abused, but I can see where some would rank it slightly lower for this.
I have yet to have a FFF that wasn't near or at the top of its class. I can't drive past Munster without stopping, it is an illness. 853 charactersGRWolverineFan, Oct 12, 2012

T - Orange zest and rind, grapefruit zing, and a hint of lemon courtesy of the Citra hops. Just bursting with flavor, as advertised.
M - On the thinner side of medium, which is perfect for the sticky resin and oily, slightly creamy finish. Outstanding.

4.28/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip pint glass.
A: Slightly hazy, light amber color with over one finger of off-white foam head. Moderate, bleached-white lacing remains on the glass and sparse bubbles rise through the column in diffuse formations.
S: Mellow, with balanced green herbaceous plant stems and crystal grain.
T: Begins off-dry, with effusive orange citrus (turning toward peach nectar as it warms) and more nuanced spicy herbaceous hop aromatics. Malt is also present, pale and slightly bready, while citric acidity is under tight control into the middle. Aromatics turn to bitter grapefruit peel as malt retreats through the second act. The finish is moderately bitter but still lusciously affected by the dry hops, emanating green and citrusy qualities.
M: Thin to medium viscosity, soft on the palate, with moderate carbonation.
D/O: This beer shines through the effective application of Citra dry hopping, with qualities that are usually reserved for draft only releases that briefly see the light of day at the nation's better beer bars. If it were an IPA, the smell would be questionable; as an APA it is satisfactory. It's appeal is mighty because the brewer was not tempted to over-reach and strive for a high gravity monster. Like some other of the best hops delivery vehicles around, this beer is better for being a "mere" pale ale. 1,364 charactersbeagle75, Sep 30, 2012

Appearance is a slightly dark orange with a good head that dimished somewhat quickly. 
Odor is complex with citrus, plenty of hops and green. 
Taste is excellent! Citrus is front and center with grapefruit very big and some pine and the hop bitterness lingers slightly. Very good would sum it up really.
Mouth feel is lightly carbonated and somewhat light.

4.8/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- An orange-golden body with copious and evenly-spread carbonation, creating a pluming 1.5" paper-white head that fades to 1/4" and persists. Thick, even lacing. 
S- Gushing with tangerine, orange, pineapple. So very citrus-tangy acidic. Potent enough to be smelled from a few feet away right after opening the bottle. 
T- Sublimely unified citrus-pine burst, very very clean. The "clean"ness is the biggest takeaway from this beer- such pungency in bouquet and nose, such a big hop sting upon first sip, and then *poof*, it blows away like dust, leaving a dry tongue and very light spritzes of alpha. 
M- Great bite from carbonation, quite a light body overall, more so than most APAs, even. It's refreshing and resinous at once. The clean leave is, again, amazing. 770 charactersgustogasmic, Sep 27, 2012

 Review from notes taken while I enjoyed the beer.
A Moderate light head over a "Miller Lite" body. Really, this is a translucent yellow body. 3.0

T Well crafted pale ale with significant hops presence and minimal malt buried deep in the background behind the hops. 3.5

S- Wonderful complex hop smell that just fills your nose. Slight...slight maltiness is present which is a wonderful thing to have in APA. 
T- Out of this world taste of hops and malt. This is how APA should taste or strive for. 
M- Medium body with a very carbonated tickle to it. I love how this beer has everything complimenting another part of it. 
O- I give it a 5 over all because even if I have 4.5s in the judging scaled this beer works so well as a whole that it deserves a 5. FFF has really nailed the APA and I would consider this to be probably the best APA--IPA--Whatever hoppy beer out there. Pliny the Elder fans if you haven't tried this get ready for a contender. 786 charactersMeowTom, Sep 15, 2012
4.92/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- pours a light pale color, in contrast to 3F's much darker flagship pale ale alpha king. Crystal clear with an appropriate carbonation level. Somewhat surpringly light in color for the abv. 
S- the wonderful smell that instantly screams citra hops. I originally tried this beer at a local beer house, Hopleaf, in Chicago in early 2011. A friend ordered it. I asked to smell it and ordered a pint solely on the aroma. Amazing. 
T- if you like clean yet complex hop flavor with a nice bitterness, this is a special beer you. It does not forget malt, and unlike some stronger ales such as Pliny (which I also love), it hides the alcohol extremely well. 
M- the mouthfeel is appropriate for a pale ale, although if this beer were to have a weakness, the mouthfeel is probably its weakest link...like if Michael Jordan were to have a weakness on the court. 
O- I've been drinking 3F beers since 2006, but to me, this blows away any other beer they have made. It easily replaces hopslam as my favorite all around beer. The only problem is that as it moves up the charts, it is becoming nearly impossible to get, even at the brewery (except on draft). 1,150 charactersKiteman, Sep 15, 2012

Living in New York I have had to move mountains to get my hands on substantial quantities of this delicious elixir (have also been fortunate enough to have on tap numerous times), and it's been more than worth it each and every time.
Appearance: Perfect orange.
Smell: Monster citrus aroma; this is literally the best-smelling beer ever. Heady is up there, but given the choice I'd give the nod to ZD. The Citra hops just explode and make love to your nostrils.
Taste: As if the aromatic citric assault weren't enough, this single-hopped paean to Citra blows you away with a palate-pleasing melange of citrusy/grapefruit taste across the citrus spectrum. If you are ever presented with just one bottle you must turn it down, because you are going to want more.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, medium-carbonation, harmoniously pleasing to the taste buds.
Overall: This is the finest beer on earth. At 6.4% it's pushing the upper limits of what you can realistically call an APA, but it doesn't matter what a beer is categorized as when it tastes like this. 1,189 charactersLarryK, Sep 14, 2012

Pours a clear amber orange with a towering, massive, rocky, off-white head. Sheen appearance with ridiculously insane, webby lace. Big sheets of complete lacing. Nose is huge orange juice, ultra dank mango, pineapple, mild sweet onion, pineapple flavored alcohol. My girlfriend thinks it smells like caramelized onions with meat...not necessarily bad. It certainly is not just a citrus/floral hop aroma. I would place the nose more at something like tamarind or other meaty Asian fruit we are not as familiar with. As it warms it gains more starchy character and sweet potatoes. In general, the nose starts off explosive and mellow out so no reason I see to let this decant like most beers. Taste has a nice biscuity quality to stave off astringency. Huge orange juice, ultra quenching malt character, with mild pineapple like alcohol and meaty fruits like jackfruit and durian. Very soft biscuity, quenching mouthfeel with decent amounts of butterscotch richness I get from Sculpin, Duet, and Alesmith IPA. Hot damn this is good. I’ve now had about three bottles of this over the past few days and the palate gets super quenching, small orange juice acidity, citrus fruitiness. Whoa. Like APA category demolition right here. Forget about topping this ever. Well, maybe fresh Spring Peeper. Perhaps a little boozy for the style but who cares. Would be dangerous as a session beer. 12/1/2011 8/5/8/5/16=4.2 1,499 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

m-Extremely clean and easy to drink with the just right amount of body. 
O-Easily the best pale ale i have ever had. Just a near perfect beer. What more could you ask for on a hot summer day? Hell.. a cold winter night, who cares, its great all the time.

S: lots of fruitiness upfront in the aroma consisting of peaches and pineapples, lots of earthy hoppy notes, citrus coming out too but did have some nice sweet maltiness.
T: great hop profile with woody, earthy, piney grassy qualities, lots of peachy pineapple fruits, good sweet malty backbone that had quite a nice balance alongside lemon citrus accents.
M: the brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, earthy, hoppy, and slight bitter finish.

A: Pours a very pretty clear gold with a one and a half finger white head that laces wonderfully. Moderate visible carbonation.
S: Grass, dank, tropical fruit and sweaty/spicy hops.
T: The grassy and spicy hop flavors are forward, balanced by a fruity sweetness and just (barely) enough light malt to create a reasonably balanced beer. Hang is the spicy hop bitterness with a touch of sweet & sticky.
M: Light weight to the beer, but at the same time a sticky dank mouthfeel. Decent carbonation sensation for the style. The ABV is incredibly well-hidden, to the point that I would question the listed value if I was more cynical.
O: Wow, this was really good and thoroughly enjoyable. I'm not sure I would go through the headache to get more, but it does (almost) make me wish that I lived in Indiana again. 914 charactersmacrosmatic, Sep 02, 2012

A: Bright gold, small head that fades very fast, but it was poured to minimize the head and maximize the volume, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt (I'm happy to drink a few extra ounces of this)
S: The most pungent tropical fruit hop aroma I've ever smelled in a beer, mango and nectarine, amazing
T: Equal to the aroma, most beers with intense tropical aroma can't quite match the flavor and end up having an overly bitter finish, but not this! Zombie dust packs so much flavor into the beer but remains a true APA, I think this can be attributed to the delicate hand with light caramel malt that balances the beer perfectly
M: Light with lively carb, very easy to drink
O: I don't know what else to say about this beer. Current trends are definitely going towards bigger and better. While Zombie Dust is not an exception to this (it is a pretty strong APA), it does highlight that fact that there are still AMAZING beers that aren't 9% abv. and 120 IBU's. 1,014 charactersdpodratsky3, Aug 30, 2012

4.52/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Huge Thanks to driftlessbrewin for this fresh bottle!
Appearance: Pours a nice hazy orange color with about 1 finger of off-white colored head. There's some decent retention and lacing, but nothing crazy.
Aroma: Orange zest, Grapefruit, Pine, Peach Skin, Apricots, White Grapes, and a hint of toasted malt.
Taste: Nice BIG citrus bitterness up front, with a good dose of resinous pine sap following close behind. There's actually a decent malt-backbone towards the middle to back end. The finish is just loaded with lingering citrus, pine, and overall bitterness. Fantastic.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with just below moderate carbonation. Works perfectly with this beer.
Morey's Bottom Line: This was sent to me in a trade. He said that he picked it up 15 minutes after it was bottled! It's about a week old now, so this is obviously a fresh sample. It ranks up there with Pliny & Heady IMO. The lingering bitterness is a very welcome attribute. Hope to have this one again. Cheers! 984 charactersMorey, Aug 29, 2012

A - A nicely carbonated beer. About two fingers of large bubble just off-white head that sticks around a while. Body is cloudy and a wonderful orange/wheat color. As the head falls, a strong beautiful lace remains. Stunning beer.
S - Citra hops. Sweet pine. Simple and delicious. 
T - Again the citra comes through immediately. A little bitter. Strong pine and slight grapefruit rind. Some orange.
M - Great carbonation and strong body for an IPA. Good.
O - A great citra hops beer. Simple all over, but nicely made. I would like to do a tasting of all these top IPAs sometime to see how they stack up against each other. There are so many similarities, it is hard when they are not tasted together. 783 charactersRuckusDu, Aug 26, 2012

A – Pours a hazy dark orange hue with a half finger, off-white head that dissipates very quickly as it settled to the edge of the glass and left no lacing.
S - I was expecting this to be an in-your face hop bomb and it was not that at all. They hype of this beer made me anticipate the strength of hop aromas I get from Abrasive, and Heady Topper, however this was way more muted. Comparing this to other Citra beers such as Citra from Kern, this too was a bit underwhelming. Very grassy, with slight hints of pine and not much else.
T – The taste, is thankfully much better than the aroma. A very well bended and smooth arrangement of hops and malts. I’m mostly picking up grapefruit and pine which leaves a nice citrus finish. 
M - Medium body with lower than liked carbonation for the style. Dry. Worthy of a return from the dead.
O – This really is a nice beer, but perhaps it wasn’t as fresh as it could have been. I will seek this out again to make sure I give it a fair shot, but to me, Citra is a way better example of this hop. 1,215 charactersdubinsky, Aug 26, 2012

The color is darker in color than most IPA's, which I greatly appreciate since this beer seems to be a confused APA/IPA brew.
S- Wow. Just wow. Smell is very floral and citrusy and is just amazing. This smell is up there with PtE, if not better than PtE with all the beautiful hop aromas.
T- Taste is again staggeringly good for an APA. Very citrusy, floral, hoppy, but still has a reasonably present malt backbone to help it remain an APA. Very well rounded taste, as it is extremely hoppy, but still holds onto its roots.
M- Mouthfeel is perfect, very smooth and bitter, starts very full and potent and finishes with a drying effect that is amazing. 
O- This beer is nearly perfection for the category, only reason I say nearly perfection is because I don't believe anything is perfect, but this is damn close. One of my top 5 beers of all time. 957 charactersKmccabe33, Aug 25, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Fresh from Three Floyd's brewery. 
Poured into tulip glass
Appearance: A murky dirty orange color that reminds me of apple juice in color. It produced a frothy good two fingers amount of head that settled quickly to a small ring around the edges of the glass. There is a high amount of lacing. 
Smell: Well lets just say this is very aromatic because I smelled it before I even poured it and then when it got in the glass the aromas seemed to just billow from my glass. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple, lemon...a very citrusy smelling beer! Simply awesome! There is obvious hop presence in the form of pine and grass but I wouldn't call it resiney. It is more of a tropical fruit mixed with the hops. One of the best smelling beers ever. 
Taste: Up first is some of the grapefruit and orange fruit taste at the front of the tongue. In the middle I am tasting some of the maltiness and sweetness like caramel and that leads directly to the hops at the tail end. A wonderful bitter but not too bitter aftertaste that stays around for quite a while. Exceptional!
Mouthfeel: This is such an easy drinking beer that I could easily drink this on a regular basis and never get tired of it. It has the perfect carbonation and it's not too thick or thin but just enough to perfectly coat my mouth with all it's glory and leave it's awesome bitter bite mixed with the tropical fruits. 
Overall: Even though I only live about 30 minutes from Three Floyd's I for some reason did not make the trip out there to get me some of this sweet nectar until about 2 weeks ago. It is absolute perfection especially on a hot summer day. Oh who the hell am I kidding it's perfect any time! 1,668 characterssleuthdog, Aug 24, 2012

The nose is a incredible arrangement of fruity hops. Citrus, lemon, pineapple,peach and orange. 
The taste starts with the same flavors, just more intense. Than there are some malt flavors in the back, which somewhat check the hops. Some more dry hops finish the beer.

Big pungent aroma. For some reason I expected a different aroma based on my experience with Citra. It wasn’t quite as melony as I expected, more bright, acidic, and maybe even a bit dank. Really hard to put in words.
Love it from the first sip. Big hop flavor, and it’s just a different flavor than I’m accustomed to in APAs. The finish has this really awesome quality to it; it’s almost a tingly sensation with a lingering bite and flavor that is, again, just hard to describe or one that I’ve experienced before. Carbonation is good, if not on the high side for style. Malts play second fiddle, but they’re doing their part by keeping this strong hop somewhat grounded.
Overall it wasn't really what I expected, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. However, I really didn’t find it to be as full on hoppy as their Alpha King. I think I actually prefer it over Zombie Dust. Granted, I only had 6 oz of the “Dust” so I really need to enjoy a few more before awarding it the silver medal. 1,061 charactersJEdmund, Aug 17, 2012

5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Fresh 12oz bottle of Zombie Dust poured into a brand new Three Floyds Teku glass. 
A: Golden peach/amber, small head despite a fairly firm pour. Leaves behind lacing, and quickly dissipates to a light coating. Moderate to light carbonation.
S: The absolute best smelling beer out there. Very crisp. Intense citrus (lemon/grapefruit/orange rind), pine, grass, a somewhat tropical mixture of flavors. 
T: A bit stronger (in a good way) than expected after the light, aromatic nose. POW! Citra, and loads of it. The amount that you'd expect in a DIPA, but with the lower ABV, this mixture is crisp and potent, without a strong alcohol taste. Malt balance is perfect, IMHO. After the full flavor subsides, a pine and citrus aftertaste is present in full force. Lasts quite a while. Perfect dry finish without overwhelming bitterness.
M: Carbonation is perfect, medium to light bodied, while still providing a very nice coating on the palate. 
O: My favorite beer. FFF knocked it out of the park with this one. Every sip starts with a hoppy, tropical teaser, is followed by the ever-so-satisfying mouthfeel, and leaves behind a craving for another sip by taunting you with left-behind hops. Every time I go a without this for a little while, I forget just how off the charts it is. Thank God I'm close enough to the brewery to get this on a regular basis, cause finding bottles anywhere else is always a joke.

Pour: Mostly clear deep orange with two fingers fluffy white head. Head diminishes to a light coating. Leaves great lacing.
Smell: Wow - a burst of tangerine and grapefruit, followed by some pine and pineapple. A nice caramel maltiness rounds out the nose. Very inviting.
Taste: Even better than the nose... Grapefruit and tangerines provides a beautiful citrusy opening. Gives a nice pine and orange bitterness. Caramel maltiness provides a really exceptional balance.
Mouthfeel: Not too bitter. Goes down so easily, but leaves an awesome bitter citrus/pine taste the palate. I could drink this all day.
Overall: One of, if not my favorite beer. Always a joy to drink this. 842 characterscfrances33, Aug 14, 2012

No born on date but picked up from the brewpub within the last 2 or so weeks.
A big thanks to Hopsmatt for sending this one over in a trade
A: Pours a golden amber with just under 2 fingers width of slightly off white colored head, which takes a good amount of time to dissipate down.  Leaves a fair amount of streaky lacing.  
S: Citrusy hops, fairly big pineapple along with lemon.  It also has a big resinous character as well, with juniper notes.  Smells nice but not the citrus presence others have been harping on.  
T: Fairly dull flavors initially.  I mostly just get lemon and pine on the backend.  Some resiny notes as well. Improves as it warms.  Pretty tasty, but simple and nothing special. 
M/D:  Appropriate carbonation, medium bodied, slightly drying finish, drinkability is good, this could definitely be a session beer. 
O: I dont get the hype here.  Its a decent beer, but I am by no means blown away.  I definitely thought Alpha King was better, and to me it remains the standard of the style.  This one was good, but nothing special.  Maybe shipping in the warm weather hurt this one (but I think that may be giving it the benefit of the doubt as I get the majority of my reviewed beers from shipped trades and usually dont notice ill effects).  A fine beer that I would purchase again if it were a local, but not something Id seek out or trade for again.  Glad I got to try it though.   1,467 characterszac16125, Aug 13, 2012

A: Pours a cloudy, light golden yellow with minimal (1/4) head. Light carbonation nucleation with medium lacing.
S: Light with Predominant grapefruit notes with linger pine resin in the background
T: Light bitterness with citrus, grapefruit, and limonene. A hint of pineapple. Bitterness lingers through the back of the pallet but the front of the pallet finished smooth. 
M: Light bubbles on the tongue. Moderately thick. Slightly syrupy. Not oily
O: A number of damn fine Pale Ales out there. This one may be a bit past its prime given its age of three months (fresh from the brewery the day of bottling), but I am not sure this lives up to the hype. Fantastic presentation of the Citra hops but a beer like this could use a tad more head and carbonation in my option, but we all like something different. Take away some of the pine resin on the back end and this one would hit my personal sweet spot dead on! Overall, an excellent brew… one of my 20 IPAs for sure! 1,120 charactersMscarpen, Aug 12, 2012

M: Not too bitter and doesn't leave your mouth dry. Does leave a nice lingering taste of hops though which is something I enjoy.

T: more of the same tropical fruits as in the nose (orange, grapefruit and subtle pineapple). Awesome bitter piney hops balance this one out. Not very complex, but this one is extremely well balanced and has a very high drinkability 
M: light-medium bodied, nice crisp finish, leaves a nice hoppy aftertaste that is mild enough to want me to take another sip. Extremely enjoyable and very high drinkability
O: this one lives up to the hype…plain and simple. Excellent smell, extremely tasty, high drinkability. Love the tropical notes to this one. Definitely one of the best, if not the best of this style. 1,004 characterstut2528, Aug 11, 2012

A: Yellowish orange. A pretty decent pour only yields a slight amount of head. 
N: Pretty glorious. Lots of hops. Pineapple, grapefruit, some caramel and toffee, a little bit of pine. There's a really nice balance of sweetness and tropical fruit here, so this one's going to be right up my alley. 
T: The taste lets me down after the promise of the nose. Very dry and earthy, with plenty of pine forest floor. Certainly nothing to complain about, but the dry hopping on the nose really makes my mouth water, and what I get is pretty dry and scraping without the abundance of the fruit.
M: Spot on for the style. There's enough palate coating, but the beer itself remains fairly light. 
O: A pretty brilliant success, and a truly good APA. I received a 6 pack, and I'll be happy to share it with multiple friends. There's some excellent hop characteristics throughout on this, but my oh my, if only the taste was as good as the nose. 980 charactersSarlacc83, Aug 11, 2012

5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had a bottle of this sent down from up north: 
Pours beautiful golden with thick one finger head into pint glass, steady stream of bubbles head to the top. 
Best aroma ever from a glass here with superb hop bouquet of perfection: aromatic nirvana for me. Sweet grapefruit and pine as well in there, and if somehow in a tropical way the taste follows suit. Nice, nice drinkability, finishes crisp and bitter with a very appealing lingering hop flavor. I guess I really favor citra hops!! I'm trying to pinpoint any slight shortcoming here but I'm already at the last sip and haven't come up with anything. Even though the malt backbone was nice it was backstage of the hop florality (new word) and I like it that way. I'm biased toward anything IPA/ DIPA, and AIPA is the least visited of the style for me. But of the ones I've tried, this does it. Superb. Easily in my Top 3 ever. I'm only sorry I can't purchase it in my state.  936 charactersTBoneJones, Aug 09, 2012

Taste: Smooth when it hits your tongue, but ends with a powerful hoppy back finish. A reasonable balance of malts.

A: Hazy golden/peach color with a generous fluffy white head. Lots of noticeable carbonation. Lacing is sticky and thick.
S: Wow. My nose is being assaulted by lemons and grapefruits. Smells like a tropical fruit IPA fan's heaven. Probably one of the best smelling beers I've come across. 
T: Follows the nose with heaping amounts of lemons and other citrus fruits. VERY tropical citrus flavors with a slight malty sweetness to balance it out. The malt is barely noticeable, which I prefer when it comes to pale ales. This is a HUGE lemon bomb, which is very much a good thing. 
M: Slightly bitter with a little bit above medium carbonation and a long lemony finish. 
O: Being from NY, I was happy to run into a guy at my local beer stop that was looking to trade these. Definitely lives up to the hype and is worth trading for if you can get your hands on it. I just wish FFF extended their distribution to the east coast instead of planning their new brewery in Europe. 1,011 charactersLordquackingstic, Jul 23, 2012
4.89/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks go out to brystmar for "extra-ing" me one of these! 12oz bottle, no date, poured into a Surly pint glass. 
Pours a dark honey-gold, with a frothy white head on top. Great sticky lace holds on for dear life. "The nose, the nose, my kingdom for the nose." All things holy, this is an amazing aroma. Fresh hops, pine needles, citrus zest, and a dry hay-like aroma. Other beers have bits and pieces of this aroma, but this is so potent and so fresh. Frick. I want to "cologne-up" with this stuff.
The body is well-balanced and carbed up well. Crisp and clean, not too heavy. Holds its own with the ABV. Hops, hops, hops. Yes, please. Fresh green hops, grapefruit, melon, orange slices, honey - all melded perfectly to make this splendid beer. This beer is bitter, no doubt, but I love that it doesn't linger in any harsh manner. The finish is short, which I like and don't like at the same time. I like that it keeps me sipping (or gulping) more and more, but I don't like that my glass is soon empty, unable to be filled with this blessed brew again.

The beer pours a light rusty orange with an off-white head. The beer's nose is incredibly dank and defines a crisp citra hoppiness. However, there is plenty of malt sweetness, which makes a huge impression on the beer's taste and mouthfeel. Thankfully the abrasively bitter hops didn't melt off my eyebrows and taste buds because the mouth watering, bitter-dry finish makes this beer something special. I would easily drink this beer all day and actually have trouble not finishing it within 5 minutes after opening. Get your hands on some and thanks Pellinore1 for the hook-up. 692 charactersThePorterSorter, Jul 23, 2012

A- Pours a nice amber gold color with a foamy one finger head. Retention is good and lacing is sticky. 
S- Hops , hops and more hops. Love the smell of Citra hops. Some sweet notes of malt but seems well balanced. One of the best smelling Pale ales just not very strong aroma. 
T- Fresh hops with a little sweet malt backbone flavor. They really profile this hop and all it's charectoristics very well. A little heavy for a pale but I love that most!!
M- Perfect. Very drinkable with medium body and carbonation. I truly could find myself easily drinking a few or more before I became hopped out.

4.57/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Aroma is quite citrusy, with a tropical component to it as well. Very hoppy for a pale ale, it really smells a lot like a citrusy IPA would. Clearly this one is going to be aggressive, not that I'd expect less from FFF.
Taste is immediately very juicy, with grapefruit and tropical notes just exploding from the Citra hops. There isn't much of a doubt where this pale ale's hop character lies. Besides this, there's a small spicy biscuit malt that struggles to poke through near the finish. Despite how flavorful the hops are however, the interesting thing is that it isn't really a very bitter one. This shows on the finish, which is dry but with very little astringency at all. Very clean, and leaves you wanting more without any grimacing. Good stuff.
I'm definitely impressed! One of the most flavorful pale ales you'll ever have, but done in a clean and easy to drink way. 879 charactersNODAK, Jul 11, 2012

The beer was a pale golden color. Big three finger and fluffy head and had an off-white color. The head lasted for days and left some decent sticky lacing along the glass. It deflated down in to some mounds of pillowy foam.
A nose full of citrus and tropical fruit. Orange peel, lemon grass, mango, pineapple. Some floral tones road underneath. Faint sweet malt backbone.
Tons of fruity and juicy hops, followed by some earthy and floral notes. There was a pretty consistant bitterness and a minor sweetness.
Very bubbly and medium-light bodied. Kind of oily with a mild acidity.
Another awesome beer by Three Floyds. I'll have to work out some more trades for this stuff. 720 charactersjeremy13586, Jul 10, 2012

Pours a darker golden color with orange hues with a two finger bright white head, great retention and abundant lacing as the head recedes. Extremely fragant with the smell of citrus rind, freshly cut grass, and orange blossoms on the nose. Opens with pleasant citrus, tangy to slighly bitter, a very light touch of sweet malt, and finishes dry, crisp and clean with citrus rind and a touch of pine and the perfect amount of bitterness. An very refreshing APA, which shows a surprising amount of complexity for a brew that uses only Citra hops. 612 characterschanokokoro, Jul 05, 2012

This beer pours out a hazy orange color with a decent head. The aroma is absolutely fantastic. This is one hoppy beer for sure, it's almost like sticking your nose right in a bag of hop pellets. Tropical fruits and citrus are the stars of the show. The taste is also absolutely fantastic, it's seriously a hop assault of the first order. The relatively low ABV keeps the malt profile to the absolute minimum (there's just a bit of pale, slightly biscuity malts if you can cut through the hops), letting the brilliant Citra hops shine through. Orange and grapefruit come out big on the flavor, leaving the tropical aspects to more of a backing flavor. Either way, it's fantastic. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and leaves the kind of dryness that's really quite similar to biting into a hop pellet, just on a much smaller scale. There's that much hops in here, guys. The drinkability is outstanding. Overall, this is the king of pale ales/IPAs for the hophead. Superb in every way. 1,092 charactersshand, Jul 03, 2012

A - Golden and clear with a big white head. Great lacing.
S - A huge, huge aroma of grapefruit, orange, mango and pineapple.
T - Pure hop flavor with all of the aspects above. The bitterness is moderate and the malt is sufficient but well overshadowed.
M - Creamy and silky with a low to moderate carbonation.

12oz bottle (no dates) into a tulip. Pours a glowing orange w/ a thick fluffy white head, good retention, nice lacing. Delicate wisps of sediment suspended in the brew, moderate carb. A beautiful beer.
Aroma is tons of grapefruit and pine. A clean punch of tropical goodness. Basically smells like a really good IPA. One word: Citra. 
Taste is pale dry biscuity malt, a good neutral canvas to showcase the delicious Citra hops. Just a touch of bubblegum. Somehow some of the expected IBU bitterness has been stripped away (I've since learned that the beer is only dry-hopped, which probably explains this), but I'm still tempted to classify this as an American IPA.
Mouthfeel is about what you'd expect. Medium body, clean, crisp. Finishes dry. Refreshing and super drinkable.
Overall, yes this is very good. Didn't quite live up to what I was expecting, probably because people talked it up soooo much. Similar to many American IPAs I've had. Beyond that, not quite sure it's worth all the fuss it has received. It's delicious, but there's nothing especially unique or different here. 1,264 charactersdraheim, Jun 30, 2012

I knew that this was highly praised by many, so I was excited to try it. All Three Floyd's bottles usually have some cool artwork, but the Zombie Dust bottles are one of my favorite.
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.
A - It looks awesome right off the bat when you pour it. Tan / golden brown with a nice 2 finger head
S - Right away the citrus / piney hops hit you hard. It's a nice, wet, hoppy smell.
T - The taste didn't blow me away, but it was very good. Very nice citrus and pine hop flavors and surprisingly easy to drink.
M - The mouth feel was average. It was a little thin for my liking, but the carbonation was just right.
O - Overall, if you have a chance to pick this up, definitely give it a try. Most people absolutely love it. But personally, I think there are better IPA's on the shelf that you don't have to hunt down to find. 963 characterscnbrown313, Jun 28, 2012

Appearance:a dark amber honey color, lactated tight white cloud colored head that leaves immedietly
Smell: like a orange grove with a light breeze
Taste: definelty my favorite part, it has great grapefruit with orange peels and little lemon zest
Mouthfeel: wow it is like I am drinking olive oil and water, but in a good way, having this great drink coating my mouth it is like the taste doesn't want to leave and I am ok with that
Overall: I see the hype and glad that a pub across the street from me has this on tap I seriously love this beer I really reminds me of pliny the elder with all the hop oil and bitterness denfintly a must have so much I think I will have a 3rd just cause 794 charactersBarleythenred, Jun 26, 2012
4.85/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Shrode21 for the trade on this one.
A vigorous pour into my stemmed Allagash glass revealed a lovely orange colored beer with a huge bubbly head that lingered for a long time. The head left great lacing as it receded. The aroma is nice and lively with hops up front in the nose (perhaps I smell Chinook and Cascade?) The taste is extremely delightful and filled with citrus, bitterness, and a clean malt sweetness that underlies all the hop awesomeness. The initial flavor is of a nice hop citrus flavor that quickly gets shoved to the side by malty sweetness, and then the bitterness takes over and it finishes smooth and tasty. The taste evolves constantly in the mouth and is a very refreshing beer.
This is an excellent Pale Ale. I have had many IPA's that are not as hoppy as this Pale Ale, but this beer is extremely well balanced. The flavors are spot on and this is probably the best APA I have ever had. Thanks again to Shrode21 for the trade, this stuff rocks. Now, can I copy this with my homebrewing skills? 1,031 charactersjifigz, Jun 25, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Zombie Dust. Three Floyds pale ale with 100% Citra hops. 6.2% ABV.
Clear, amber/apricot/peach coloration. Generous heap of ample snowy white froth atop. with loads of lace-leaving. Looks great.
Aromatics: Big fresh and floral hoppitude, overflowing citrus notes. Some lemon, some lime, a hint of pineapple, a gesture towards mango. Loud, lively, and lovable.
Taste: boom, there it is, bouncing on the palate, swimming in the mouth, a flood of hoppy goodness. Medium malty mouthfeel, nothing too heavy, nothing too hard, just a ton of easy-drinking-ness. A flood of fruit hits the sense with each new sip, a blast of citrus greets the tongue and hits the roof, and slides down the throat. Very refreshing, and super-extra-consumable.
But is this the best thing ever brewed in the history of mankind? Don't think so. Come on, it's a pale ale. Get over it. 857 charactersfeloniousmonk, Jun 25, 2012

4.44/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this on-tap on 2012-06-19 in Warsaw, IN at The Downtown beer bar. Also had this on-cask on 2013-04-07 at the brew pub in Munster, IN (it was equally good, if not a little better on-cask)
A - Fairly clear, golden-orange with a 2-finger white head into a nonic glass, which fades pretty quickly and leaves mild lacing. 
S - Big amounts of mango and papaya, some pineapple and orange flesh, pine, hop bud oils. More aroma than when I last had it in the bottle.
T - Mango, papaya and orange flesh. Nice amount of pine then some orange zest bitterness. The sweetness of the malt really compliments the fruit flavors and briefly gives a creamsicle impression. Finishes dry and nicely bitter but with a clinging tropical and citrus residue. 
M - Creamy with medium body and carbonation. It's thicker than I expected, which seems to compliment the idea of biting into fresh fruit. Somewhat oily but not prickly. There's certainly enough carbnoation to scrub the tongue; leaving you ready for the next taste.
O - Just a fabulous APA although truth-be-told, it is more IPA than APA. Great, great stuff. Unfortunately for me, when I went to order my second pint with dinner, the waiter told me I'd my first glass killed their keg. A well; at least I got to taste it fresh on-tap less than 2-hours from the brewery.
Note from 2017-07-14.  I dropped the taste from 4.5 to 4.25.  I prefer Alpha King to Zombie Dust.  I didn't change any of the text from my 2012 review in order to preserve my original thoughts. 1,507 charactersTucquan, Jun 24, 2012

My jaw hit the floor when I began going through his latest goodie bag and if he needs references, hopefully mine will suffice.
There was no gushing when I removed the cap, but there was a finger of thick, tawny head by the time that I finished with the pour. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was rich with citrus - grapefruit and orange in abundance. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a citrus intensity on the tongue that killed off all of the weak taste buds that got in its way. I felt like the fellow in the old Maxell tape commercial - blown back in my seat by the intensity of the experience. The finish was literally breathtaking - I really felt as though my breath had been taken away for a second or two after the swallow. The next thing to hit was the intensity of its dryness as I tried to catch my breath. The hops were toying with me to see if I measured up and I was doing my best to rise to the challenge. I suppose that my loss means that I will be transformed into a zombie at some point, but if a transformation must take place, better in my mind to be a zombie this way than a Cyberperson via a Minhas product. 1,256 characterswoodychandler, Jun 23, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have been saving myself to write my first review until I tried this beer. It has taken 5 years, but I finally have gotten my hands on this marvelous brew. 
Poured from a bottle into an imperial pint glass.
A: Pours a light amber color, not quite the right color for a pale ale, so this is my only knock on this beer. A one finger head dissipates as you drink it, but it leaves a little tracing on the glass
S: Grapefruit, hops, spice, and floral. Beautiful combination of beta acid hops stand out. As it warms, a slight sweetness takes over. 
T: Juicy, the label had it right! There is a beautiful balance of malt and hops, slight herb, citrus, a bit of bread/yeast comes through as well. Slight bitterness as it finishes, but not a palate wrecker. Very crisp and refreshing. 
M: Mild carbonation, coats your mouth, but doesn't linger like more hoppy beers. 
O: This is my favorite new brew. I had read great things about this beer for 5 years, and have been waiting patiently to get my hands on it. Anytime anyone wants to trade this beer to me, I will not turn it down. What a great combination of hops and grain! I continue to be amazed as I drink this beer. 1,169 charactersZakk, Jun 23, 2012

4.34/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 12oz bottle to dimple mug:
Pours a nice, clear pear gold with a swelling finger of dense-ish white head. Consistent, slow beading and average lacing.
The nose is truly divine... lush tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, heavy sweet syrup, nectarine, all sorts of citrus, bits of dank herb. Massive smelling beer.
The taste hosts a whole slew of similar notes, but not quite the same density that is achieved in the aroma. Certainly a whollop of citric hops. Tasty stuff.
The feel is a tad thin. Still immensely drinkable, especially given the insane level of hop dosage. 
Great beer that I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to try. 657 charactersyamar68, Jun 20, 2012

Golden-red-amber body. Very little head.

4.94/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First beer I bothered to post a review of. That is because this is the single best beer of the APA/IPA style I have ever had. Living in San Diego, I have access to a lot of that style but nothing we have comes close to this. I recently traded for a case courtesy of kawilliams81 after previously having a few 6 packs from trades. 
A: It is seriously a "5" beer. I gave appearance a 4 as it is a cloudy, golden colored beer. I don't care about appearance at all but I think they look the nicest when totally clear.
S: The nose of this beer is incredible. Huge Citra blast that you'd expect from a a HUGE IPA, all in a "little" 6ish % ABV beer. Very fruity, smells absolutely delicious. 
T: Incredible. No - it's not a giant "Triple" IPA hop/malt bomb - instead it's a perfectly juicy, easy drinking, flawlessly balanced treat. I really can't explain it, just try it.
M: Light, refreshing, drinkable. Finish is gone soon after swallow, nothing lingers. 
Overall: Again, get some of this fresh if you can. Nothing like it. My favorites of this style in San Diego are Hoppy Birthday and New Millenium from Alpine Beer Company, but they have nothing on ZD. If this was on the shelf here along with Pliny, Sculpin - ANY of our stuff, I'd pull the ZD every time. 1,260 charactersevilc, Jun 18, 2012

4.73/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Serving Type: Poured from 12oz bottle into Lagunitas mason jar. Bottling date unknown.
Appearance (5.0) - Voluminous chalk-white head with a cappuccino-foam consistency, 2 1/2 fingers. Tenacious but sparse lacing as the head recedes. Even after several minutes the surface is still glazed with thin but complete layer of fine white foam. Beautiful, clear orange body with visible effervescence. Pretty ideal. Looks just a like a hop-dominant pale ale should.
Smell (4.5) - Smells like a farmer's market would if you live near the equator. Lush tropical fruit; papaya, banana, tangerine, ruby grapefruit, even a hint of strawberry-kiwi. Traces of a delicate floral aroma are apparent momentarily after the initial fruit kick fades. Wonderful. Pine and spice not in evidence. If pressed I'd say the only thing to improve upon would be enhancing the strength of the aroma just a little bit.
Taste (5.0) - Follows the smell; sweet tropical fruit. It's like a papaya/citrus/pineapple smoothy in beer form. A nutritionist would count a 12oz bottle as at least two full servings of fruit. Really wonderful and balanced, with the malt taking an obvious backseat in order showcase the delicate and ripe blend of warm, floral flavors from the hops. A gentle bitterness chases the fruit out of the mouth. Very faint hint of herbal undertones after the swallow, like a touch of green bell pepper. Damned delicious.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Round, creamy, light. Carbonation is medium-high, but bubbles are minute and silky, and so the overall feel is that of a slightly less carbonated beer with a velvety buoyancy. Very enjoyable. Only thing to improve upon would be perhaps toning down the acidity a notch or two, as it claws at the cheeks a bit in its current form.
Overall (4.5+) - I considered giving this a (5.0) overall, but I can't quite say that there literally isn't any room for improvement, so it gets a (4.5+). Like I mentioned above, toning down the acidity and beefing up the aroma a small bit would be two good strategies to take this beer to the next level. That said, this is without a doubt the best pale ale I've had to date. It's really fantastic and if you haven't had one I think you definitely should!

Nose is all about the hops. Bright citrus aromas. A single hop showcase, for sure. 
Moderately bitter and fairly dry, this is my kind of Pale Ale. So many beers in this range come across as muddled or dull. Zombie Dust is big, bright, and full of character. 
Medium bodied with a dry finish. This is just how an American Pale Ale should be.

4.24/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a clear, deep golden color with no head. Head never developed as a consequence of the care taken in the pour by the attendant. Incidentally, it was nice to see that the 3 Floyds staff were just as cheerful as ever *sarcasm*. Even as guests of Firestone-Walker after having been invited to their beer festival, the 3 Floyds staff were lifeless, provided no information about their beers, and couldn't even muster a smile or spare a "you're welcome." Anyway, back to Zombie Dust. The beer has a glorious floral bouquet with just a hint of peat. The mouthfeel, which enjoys a decent balance of carbonation, is good for the style. The flavor is grapefruit forward with notes of peat. A good effort. 700 charactersDocJitsu, Jun 10, 2012

Smell and taste are intense, and amazing! This is perhaps the best pale ale I've had. Intense grapefruit and earthy pine on the smell. Taste is a bold, crisp, deliciously piney and citrus hopped blast of flavor, with fruity notes. The malts offer body but mostly I'm tasting hops. 
Given that this is a citra showcase beer, it makes me want to brew an all citra pale ale soon! 
The body is light yet almost tingly with hops and fruity aftertastes. 
Overall this beer rocks and I'm leaving it on my wants list! 612 charactersAlCaponeJunior, Jun 09, 2012

Served from bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, citrus, citrus hop, pine, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, earth, and pine hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. Holy refreshing as crap Batman!!! I had this one back when it was called Cenotaph and figured I would have to revisit it now that it is bottled. And I am quite glad that I got the chance to do so. The balance on this one made it quite easy to drink and quite nice to smell as well. I actually found myself taking HUGE mouthfuls of this brew rather than sipping on it. Not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing, but I definitely didn’t mind. Still one of the best American Pale Ales I’ve had. Get this on your palate!!! 1,075 charactersthagr81us, Jun 07, 2012

Hazy golden/orange color with lots of visible carbonation and a crisp white bubbly head that quickly dissipates but leaves nice lacing.
The same tropical fruits in the aroma come across on the palate too. Big on papaya and guava, and some passion fruit. All of these flavors are bold, and right upfront but mid palate, and the finish don't really bring much of anything. These flavors are gone as quickly as they built up.
Moderate amount of carbonation, and a moderate body. The beer finishes quite dry but with no lingering flavors, it's just.. dry. While this is a good beer, I believe it is over-hyped a bit. 821 characterstlazaroff, Jun 06, 2012

S: Loads of sweet citrus here with orange and pineapple dominating. There are grapefruit notes as well along with a grassy and almost weed-like aroma mixed in as well. Smells amazing.
T: The flavor is a lot more earthy than the aroma, with grapefruit dominating more with pine and grass flavors as well. The finish is lightly bitter and earthy.
M: Medium-light body with sudsy carbonation, this beer is light and drinkable, though slightly more watery than I prefer.
O: A great beer, overall, with the best aroma of any pale ale I've ever had. Unfortunately the flavor doesn't quite match the aroma and the body is a bit watery, but it's still a fantastic beer. 773 charactersn2185, Jun 05, 2012

The taste is so well balanced with the hops it makes this by far the most drinkable beer I've ever had. Sweet but not too sweet, bitter but not to bitter. The malts are a slight caramel mixed wonderfully with citrus notes of the hops. Just an incredible example of the pale ale category. 598 charactersProspero, Jun 01, 2012

After reading so much love for ZD I am stoked to finally sit down and sip a few. Poured into a tulip. Maybe the best looking brew I have seen, sunset orange with super thick sticky two finger bright white head that clings to the glass leaving beautiful lacing. The nose, maybe as good or better than Kerns Citra, I can just happily sit here and smell this for hours, tropically dense from the Citra, amazing. The flavor profile is citrusy, sweet, balanced, and a tad bitter from the 60 IBU, perfect.The mouth is crisp, clean, and medium weighted, perfect for this holiday weekend at the shore. If there is perfection then ZD is it, the best APA I have ever had. Sadly not available on the west coast, happily sitting with two six packs to enjoy over the next couple weeks. Bravo 3 Floyds, the hype is more than justified. 900 charactersOTB, May 28, 2012

A: The pale ale is an amber color, plentiful with orange and brown hues defining it. Transparent with a slight haze. The head is white and luxurious, coating the sides of the glass with lace.
S: The aromas are juicy but restrained, never losing sight of the pale ale base. That base is caramel and lightly toasted biscuit. The hops though, hold their own and then some. The citra drips with citrus and orange zest, ample bitterness running on par with the malts. Excellent smells here.
T: The balance is the great thing about this ale, neither hops nor malts get the upper hand. The malts are light - bready with caramel richness. The hops - and there is where I want to spend time, are delicious. The orange and citrus flavors are strong, intense even within the balanced confines of the ale. When cold, the malts are bigger. Only when the ale warms do the hops shine through - wait for that part of the ale. A top notch pale ale.
M: Clean and hoppy, with an emphasis on the hoppiness. Orange zest and bold citrus standing out against the surprising malt side. I'm afraid that I'll finish off this six pack one one fell swoop. 1,205 charactersakorsak, May 20, 2012

Smell: A strong tropical citrus and a full bisciuty, bready malt. I could also pick up a light hop spiciness, reminiscent of spiced peaches, but very faint.
Taste: The hops are very pleasant, moderate, smooth bitterness and massive flavor. The dominant hop feature is more topical citrus, with the emphasis on mango. The malt is surprisingly active in the flavor as well, contributing a sweet bisciuty, bread character that plays extraordinarily well with the hop flavor. A lot going on here for a pale ale.
Mouthfeel: Excellent carbonation, a strong tingle that opens up your palate to the hops and gives a nice dry finish, very clean and refreshing.
Overall: This is one hyped ale, and I can see why. It is no doubt of the west coast style, but it is none the less a very unique beer. It is much hopier than any APA I have had, but it is also much more balanced than any West coast IPA. The bitterness is very smooth, but the hop flavor is extraordinarily large, a trend that has been occurring more and more as time goes on. A fantastic ale, no doubt in my mind, I would always keep this in my fridge if I could. 1,291 charactersSiriusfisherman, May 19, 2012

The appearance is nice, amber meets straw in color.
The nose is pleasant enough, almost a lighter, yet similar, nose to Kern River Citra.
The taste is interesting, but not overwhelmingly appealing. The hops clean your tongue a little in the beginning, and it's okay in the middle, but this is where you start to get that hint of wood. Yes, wood. And it really comes through in the finish. To me, it's not a great addition to this beer. And it's not a piney or citrusy flavor. It's kinda generic---wood. I have it 3 times, albeit always from a bottle. Maybe on tap would be different.
I'm not writing ZD off. And I'm not hating on them. In fact, if offered I will try again. I'm not scared off of this one, just a little perplexed by the hype. 872 characters2beerdogs, May 17, 2012

The smell is juicy with hops. Rindy with fruits and a floral component giving way to fresh herbs. It is tangy with a soft touch of alcohol across the nose. Overall a very fresh, enjoyable smelling brew.
The taste is juicy with hops. Floral, fruity and herbal with rindy and zesty bitterness leaning towards grassy but not quite. An accenting fruity alcohol touch and an undertone of toasty malt provides enough sweetness to really make the hops pop. There is no joke here, this brew is all about the hops. I love how flavorful this brew is without the bitterness getting overdone.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is crisp and very easy drinking. If made readily available to me, I would drink this regularly and in excessive quantities. 978 charactersstakem, May 16, 2012

Hazy dark orange with a white head, modest head and good lacing. Nose is all citra, mango, peach, apricot and the 'pittiness' of these fruits really comes through. Sweet malt, and some pine on the back end. Fantastic consistency as soon as this touched my lips, more peach and mango pit, sweet malt with a hint of caramel. Brilliant mouthfeel - fairly full, with some consistency, and something that I think should really be the gold standard for the style. Moderate bitterness, and easily consumed. A top-tier APA. 560 charactersliamt07, May 13, 2012
4.72/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Big HUGE thanks to mordormongo for the hookup.
A: Beautiful reddish orange, mostly clear colored beer. Relatively aggressive pour leads to a full one-finger head that sloooowly dissipates to whisps and leaves thick, sticky lacing.
S: Holy wow. HUGE hops. Ginormous citrus hops followed immediately by the pine bitter that one is familiar with when it comes to big time hoppy beers. The malt profile is definitely present and accounted for but it's totally overshadowed by the big time hop profile.
T: Taste follows the nose in that it's an extremely deliciously hoppy beer. Tons of pine hop bitterness, lots of citrus zest and just an overall delicious flavor.
M: Dry finish, perfectly carbonated. Bitterness almost makes me pucker.
O: What to say? Really this is an IPA in Pale Ale's clothing. I suppose given it's 6.2% abv, it's given a pass but this is an excellent beer regardless of what the style is. 974 characterssuspect, May 13, 2012

Smells super hoppy and fresh. By far the best smelling beer I've ever had. It smells dirty in a good way. 
Tastes as good as it smells. A nice bite of bitter with citrus throughout. Sweet malt is there, but overpowered by the fresh hoppiness. This overpowering is good and makes it awesome.
Nice and smooth with perfect amount of carbonation. 456 charactersHorbar, May 13, 2012

Bought a case of these guys at the brewpub while on a road trip for 35$ without having ever had one, best investment I have ever made. That's 8.75$ a sixer!
A- Pours pale orange/golden and is slightly hazy only if you twirl the bottle mid pour. The head is rather large and sticks around all the way. It is a slightly off white color and is made of a really dense foam. Good lacing down the glass.
S- This Brew absolutely wreaks, in the best possible way. Super hoppy. The hop character is surprisingly complex for a single hop beer. A lot of pine up front followed up by gobs of citrus flavors; pineapple, mango, apricots and oranges. A touch of light malt and grain. Very sugary sweet as well, reminds me of fruit loops or captain crunch.
T- Taste is slightly bitter up front is super hoppy. The hop flavors are very citrus forward. A lot of pineapple, mango and orange. A slight bit of pine and lemon zest is also detectable. The malts really take a back seat to the hop ridiculousness but compliment the hops quite well. The malts are very sugary, a touch of breadiness and caramel but these malts really remind me of sugary cereal for some reason and it works really well here.
M- Moderate IPA level bitterness. The beer is well carbonated and rather light. Super drinkable and the taste keeps you coming back, hard to drink only one. A dry hoppy aftertaste that leaves me wanting more.
O- I find it hard to believe anything is perfect but I simply cant bring myself to give this beer anything less then a perfect score. This is my first perfect 5 rating after almost 200 reviews and I don't see myself giving another, at least for a long time. Everything about this beer is incredible, the price, the taste, the feel, the label art, the availability... well not for most of us but at least its guaranteed fresh. For a hop forward pale ale, this beer may just be perfect. 1,924 charactersTwelveOunces, May 12, 2012

Jonathan the Zombie would take a sip of this and repeat, "Wow, I REALLY like turtles!!!" I like turtles, but I love Zombie Dust!
It toes the line between an IPA and a PA. Who cares. One of the best beers you can find for either class. Citrus nose, a bit of weediness, and an interesting funkiness in the finish (not a bad thing). Medium bitterness on the finish, but not lingering. 
As advertised...awesome. 444 charactersChiPool, May 12, 2012

A: Pours a pale golden yellow with a slightly off white head of foam. There are plenty of bubbles with pieces of sediment strewn throughout. This looks like a Pils or a Belgian Ale. It's a very pretty looking beer. Perfect.
S: This might be the best aroma of any beer ever. So intoxicating. A blast of hoppy citrus. All kinds of it. Grapefruit. Clementines. Pineapple. My wife smelled sour cherries. Simply amazing. I could smell this all day.
T: You can taste the citrus flavor as soon as it hits the lips. Wonderful. I wished the flavor lasted longer, but it's beaten by a nice bitter finish. But, this is an fantastic flavor. One of the best ever. A complaint is, to a certain degree, this almost comes across as a citrus soda. A weird observation, and it doesn't ruin the drinking experience, but it's there.
M: Oddly enough, I think the carbonation effects the flavor a bit, but I love the feel of it. This is the definition of bold carbonation. The beer tingles on the tongue. A lighter than expected body makes this beer crisp and refreshing. Terrific.
O: One of the best beers ever. There is a lot of hype surrounding this beer, and it more than lives up to it. Trade for it. Buy it. Just make sure you get your hands on this wonderful brew. 1,281 charactersC20Percent, May 09, 2012

A- incredible golden orange color with enough clarity to know they weren't being lax on the brew process. Head pours small bubbles, which sticks around for the entire time drinking it. 
S- Aromatic hops running in the glass from start to finish while drinking it. Usually the aromatics stick around for a minute after the pour, but I found myself going back to the glass to smell it the entire time I was drinking this brew. 
T- Amazing! So well balanced with the perfect amount of bittering and aromatic hops. Would say that this brew touches on IPA territory, but reels back in to Pale Ale land. 
This has got to be one of the best balanced pale ales I have ever had, but it also pushes the limits of the style. 
M- nice coating on the tongue and works its way around the mouth like a great beer should. Great carbonation and nothing too heavy throughout the tasting.
O- Gonna have to go back and re-rank those that I put close to this one. I am putting it up there as one of my favorites of all time. I could drink it all day, yet it has a powerful punch that lets me know I am drinking real beer. 1,267 charactersSouleman, May 06, 2012

(A)- Pours a clear golden orange color. Some great white froth, retention, and lace.
(S)- A great burst of a lemon lime like citrus. Some grapefruit too. Just an awesome citrus profile with an ever so subtle pine in the background.
(T)- Similar to the smell. Just an awesome fresh and vibrant fruity citrus profile for the style. Just the perfect amount of subtle bitter pine at the end.
(M)- A great carbonation level and an even better balance and feel. The citrus is just awesome and still has a smooth/clean, ever so slightly bitter finish. Simple, but comes of as very complex for the style.
(D)- Fits the bill perfectly; this is how I have always imagined what my ideal pale ale is. A great profile and just a pure overall enjoyment factor. I have never been a huge Three Floyds fanboy, but this might be their crowning acheivement. At the same time, it has been a long long long time since a pale ale has really impressed me like this one has. 988 characterssweemzander, May 06, 2012

A-Glowing hazy orange with a nice dense white head and good lacing
S-The smell was the single best part of the beer for me. Super piney with sharp citrus and pineapple lots of sweet grapefruit too. Probably the single best smelling beer I have ever had
T-The smell is much stronger than the taste. Not to say the taste is not great, because it is. Tart (?) hop bitterness carries over with strong grapefruit notes, very little cereal grain malt sweetness. Subtle graham cracker in the back gets purged with a nice bitterness. Really nice.
M-Pretty lush, and soft. Nice amount of CO2 keeps it light and not too resiny from the dry hopping. Nice.
O-If there is a perfect session beer for hop heads this is it. Its strong, aggressive and multifaceted while still being easy to drink. Pretty awesome stuff. I only wish it was in Colorado... 868 charactersMinorThreat, May 05, 2012

A: Bit of a darker Pale Ale than usual, medium golden copper colored body with a huge frothy and foamy white head. Lacing and retention were great, big sticky patches on the glass wall along with a solid foam cap.
S: Pale malts, floral hops, citrus fruits like orange and mango, hints of pineapple and a certain grassy quality. It's really a nice smelling beer, the head hindered some of the aromatics but overall a big juicy beer.
T: Lots of bitterness up front followed by plenty of citrus fruits. Orange, pink grapefruit and pineapple come into play along with a floral hop character that seems to stick through the entirety. The back end has some earthy sticky bitterness but it ends rather clean with a light malt note.
M: Bubbly, well carbonated and medium-bodied. It doesn't drink too light but it's enough to give this "Pale Ale" a clean mouth feel.
Okay, let's be honest, this isn't a Pale Ale, right? It's so hopped up I'd easily consider this an India Pale Ale. The profile is akin to the classic West Coast style with its big juicy tropical fruit notes. The hops are kept in check but it's certainly over the top for a Pale Ale. Because it's not in style, in my opinion, I knocked the overall down a bit. Still it's a damn tasty beer. 1,359 charactersShanePB, May 03, 2012

Pours lightly hazy orange/amber with a two finger off-white head that leaves a lot of clingy lacing and holds a small cap.
Aroma is citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, a lot of pineapple and tropical fruits, some apricot, pine and floral notes, a bit of biscuity malt underneath all the hops as well. Very good strength.
Flavor is incredibly hoppy, and not just for a Pale Ale, this hangs right there with many top-tier IPAs. Grapefruit, pineapple, tropical fruits, melon, pine, grass, fairly dank and resinous. Pretty much all hops but there is a bit of cracker-like malt there. Minimal sweetness, very nice bitterness on the finish. Minimal alcohol.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, a little sticky, good carbonation.
Boy, I thought their Alpha King was the be-all-end-all of APAs...and then I try this. Wow. Amazing beer, redefines the style. Probably the hoppiest APA I’ve ever had. Fantastic. 1,010 characterselgiacomo, May 03, 2012

Poured into a pint glass at The Black Sparrow pub in Lafayette, IN. 
A: Rich copper-gold color, with a creamy beige head. Most of the head seems to have been poured off, but it still maintains some thick retention and smooth lacing. Looks great.
S: There’s that pungent aroma I’ve been waiting for! In true FFF fashion, it’s a grapefruit blast, with an underlying sweetness of strawberry, lemon, blackberry jam, and pineapple. The citrus is strong with this one. It’s not a pine-bomb, like many of FFF’s hoppy brews, but rather sweet and absolutely juicy. Pale malt aromas round it out throw some toasted bread and fresh grass aromas around, keeping the nose balanced at every whiff. Excellent, excellent nose.
T: Those hops are incredible! Some of the best whole cone tastes I’ve had in a while: flowery and resiny, with mild pine at the fore. After a light sharpness at the start, though, they absolutely gush with juicy fruit flavor: tart grape and pineapple, raspberry puree, persimmon, all-natural orange juice, and pulpy, rich grapefruit. It’s hop juice, but not abrasive in the slightest. Pure Citra glory! But that’s not all – the malts are here to balance it all out. Bready and full of thick, chewy flavor, these pale grains lay a bed of wheaty-smoothness: toast crusts, buttery crackers, and some light (very light) caramel malt. Aftertaste is so mild it’s almost unapparent; just a hint of fruit flavor, like I’ve been chewing on some Fruit Stripes for the last half-hour. It’s hardly dry, making it that much more drinkable.
M: Chewy, drinkable! One of the best parts of this brew. It feels full-bodied, but goes down with just a tingle of carb – bubbles that truly feel smaller and silkier than other pales I’ve had. This is truly one of the best examples of drinkable hop juice I’ve ever had. Unbelievably smooth.
O: Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of my new favorites. Every sip made me smile. It’s rare when a beer is everything you thought it would be, but FFF has done it before (cue Gumballhead, Rabbid Rabbit, etc.). Now I’m wondering if the Dark Lord in my fridge will live up to the hype…at any rate, I’m much more confident now that it will. I need to take a trip to Munster, ASAP. 2,393 charactersBarryMFBurton, May 02, 2012

A - light orange in colour with a finger of sticky white head, easily the most standard aspect of this beer.

No freshness date on the bottle that I noticed, but should be less then 2 weeks old.
A- Pours a very translucent golden with about a quarter finger of white head. About average carbonation.
S- Hops, sugary malts, slight floral smell.
T- Hops, light berry taste, sugary malts, light sugary and a tiny bit tart berries aftertaste.
M- A little bit on the lighter side, average carbonation, smooth, easy to drink.
O- This was a good beer however I don't think it lives up to it's hype. It tasted good, I just thought it had a little bit too much of a sugary taste and not a ton of flavor for a highly ranked beer. It was very easy to drink and one of the better pale ales I've had, but I definitely wouldn't say it's one of the best beers I've had (one of my least favorites on the top 100 list). That being said I enjoy drinking it, as a beer in a 6-pack it's definitely worth it, but I don't think it is necessarily a must try although I recommend trying it if you get the chance. 1,080 charactersjaasen64, May 02, 2012

Pours golden yellow, nice carbonation. Fairly clear. Nothing unexpected.
Smells blast you with fresh hoppy goodness. That perfect melding of pine and citrus. Grapefruit probably the strongest. Very fresh and vibrant hop profile. 
Taste is crisp, clean, and all about the hops. Grapefruit and orange rinds, pine complementing the citrus. Pithy bitterness bites perfectly. Fresh and bright. Sometimes crisper and lighter hop-heavy beers are perfumey or too floral, but Zombie Dust avoids that. Pale malts provide nothing more than support for the citra. 
Some chewy resin on the mouthfeel, but I wanted more. Personal preference, I guess. I know it's supposed to be easy drinking and clean, but I want those hops to sink in and stick around longer. (about the only thing I would change)
Ultimately, this may be the best 5-7% ABV IPA I've had. A good batch of Furious has always been my standard, but I think ZD, overall, is better. (Although when I bring home some Furious, I know when it was canned.) Dating quibbles aside, great stuff here. 
Putting it in 12oz bottles and charging 35 dollars for a case is awesome, FFF. Nice to see you price something reasonably on occasion. 1,204 characterscaskstrength, May 01, 2012

Visually this is about perfect, healthy head, lacing, translucent body, lively orange color.
The aroma slays me, tropical fruits unlike any other APA, huge amounts of mandarin orange, floral esters, wonderful.
The flavors are clean and refreshing, unhindered by malt inconveniences. Tropical, and papaya speaks out to me, clementines and mandarins, bitterness with a touch of fruity sweetness to keep it from being harsh.
Just got back from a quick 35 mile ride, and this is hitting every spot i have. Best APA there is. (daisy cutter is 2nd btw)

Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.
A: Light, straw-colored golden with a massive, creamy white head. The head has great retention and holds an 1/8 inch head throughout the drink. It leaves behind cobwebs of lacing on the sides. It appears very lively and inviting with an ample amount of carbonation.
S: Very nice hop profile with a big citrus kick of orange and lemon. Tropical fruits of mango and pineapple make an appearance. A touch of toasted malts provide a solid backbone to the aroma.
T: The taste is slightly different than the aroma. The hoppy citrus aspect is still there as is the toasted malts, but I'm missing out on the tropical fruits here. Instead, the tropical fruits are replace with a bit of pine.
M: Medium bodied, with a perfect amount of carbonation. It has a subtle resiny feel to it, making it kind of oily and allowing the flavors to coat the palate throughout drinking. A slight bitter bite towards the end provides a nice crispness.
O: I certainly wasn't disappointed with this highly regarded brew. I would put this up against any of the highly rated IPA's out there. Superb. 1,183 charactersBilbosNuts, Apr 29, 2012

4.45/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Perfect Golden Amber Color. Nice fine head with convecting carbonation.
Nose: Well put together, some grapefruit but not too bitter. Good sweetness. Nice hop notes, pure and clean. A nice clean IPA caliber of hop presence. 
Taste: A good amount of hops that are clean, simple and not overly bitter. A good amount of malt to balance this out. I get some grapefruit, but it's not a bitter bomb. The pine is there also and there is very little alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Some good carbonation, good thickness. 
Overall: A really well pieced together APA/IPA. Pushes the APA to it's limit. How an IPA should be put together, thoughtfully. The amount of hops is restrained (instead of just cramming them in for no reason) and it's balanced well by the malt. The bitterness is spot on for me as well and with very little alcohol. Really enjoyed this.
From the bottle, poured into a Bells Tulip, perfect 50th review beer! 924 characterscradke, Apr 28, 2012

Head is cream colored and rather dense, pretty decent retention. Wow! Aroma is fantastic. Citra hops come through strong and sharp in my nose. I could smell this all day. Bit of pine, lotta citrus. Taste is mellowed and more appropriate for an APA (though you won't hear me complaining) I taste citrus sweetes in the middle of the palate and get a resonant pine bitterness aftertaste. The mouthfeel is spot on for an APA, medium/light body with carbonation enough to liven the beer. This is a great beer, it's unfortunate this isn't sold out here in Oregon/Washington. 650 charactersgkunkle, Apr 25, 2012

This beer pours like a sunset. A combination of golden, orange and yellow. It has two inches of pillow white head. Thick and sticky gobs of head cling to the sides of the glass.
Citra hop explosion in the nostrils. Orange, mango and pineapple aromas at the forefront. Lemon zest and a bit of earthiness compliment the beautiful citra hops. As tropical as a beer can get. Bitterness is pleasant and moderate.
The taste offers more of the same aromatic bouquet of citra hops. Lots of tropical fruitiness. Pineapple and mango are dominant followed by orange and lemon. Moderate and perfectly placed bitterness lingers at the end. Truly superb.
Soft and creamy mouthfeel that yields medium carbonation. It bursts with creaminess. One of the most drinkable APAs I've had. No alcohol detected.
Zombie Dust has set the bar for APAs. The citra hop aroma and flavor profile is unmatched. Tropical, fruity, bitter and balanced to near perfection. World class stuff and a must try. 1,007 charactersdgugliuzza, Apr 23, 2012

Appearance: head retains throughout the drink. Nice orange golden haze.
Nose: very aromatic! Had a great citrus fruit type of aroma, can't quite place it
Taste: very reminiscent of an IPA given the hop character. You get that slight hop bittering too & I dig it, who knew APA?
Mouthfeel: coats the tongue very well, some of that tingly abrasive character that I usu get from IPAs I get from this beer
Overall: world class is exactly what this beer is. Don't know if APA is the best label for it, but FFF delivers on all levels with Zombie Dust, will definitely seek again 607 charactersqueens1130, Apr 22, 2012

A: Hazy golden-orange color. A few large sediment particles hang in suspension before settling to the bottom of the glass. Creamy, bone-white head has great retention and leaves behind a thick collar of lacing.
S: Grapefruit rind, tangerine, and other vibrant tropical scents in the foreground. Pithy, green, and weed-like scents underneath. Melon, strawberry, and passion fruit. Malt base smells sweet and sugary, but indistinct otherwise. This smells more like an IPA than any other American Pale I've ever had.
T: Bitter grapefruit rind and pine resin on the attack. Green, oily bitterness rides up shortly after. Pithy and weed-like tastes register briefly too.Tropical and strawberry/passion fruit flavors are there, at first stuck in the background, but eventually they break through. Bitterness remains constant throughout. Tangerine, mandarin orange, and honeydew melon start to run away with the show. Malt base is slightly sweet at first, but dries into a nice biscuity flavor by the end. Slight yeast character, maybe a touch nutty. Finishes with tropical fruits and a nice rind and resin bitterness that sits atop drying biscuity flavors. 
M: Medium to light in body. Very creamy and silky. Oily too. Finely-bubbled carbonation lifts and scrubs. Great mouthfeel.
O: Many American Pale Ales straddle the thin line between APA/IPA. To me this beer has crossed over and sits pretty firmly in IPA territory. Not that I'm complaining though. They can call it whatever they want, as long as it's still a damn good beer. Very high marks for this one. It lives up to the hype. Seek it out and drink it. 1,656 charactersryan1788a5, Apr 21, 2012

A: nice head retention after an initially large head on a dark golden or orangish body.

T: fantastically well rounded flavor (for me) of citrus, bitterness, and malt.

Scent brings big whiffs of pungent grapefruit, some pine resin and a good blend of tropical fruit and citrus, mouthwatering, lightly sugary sweet and modest detection of light caramelized malts. Taste is not as bold or as devastating as the scent had me fearing, but this is a pale ale... strong bitter grapefruit notes, followed by more citrus and tropical notes, fruits come across as more rind than juice. Sweet in a juicy way with a touch of lightly caramelized malts. Bitter, lightly drying on the palate, good body. Overall, a very enjoyable APA with strong flavor and scent notes. 726 charactersrfgetz, Apr 19, 2012

4.41/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a clear golden apricot color with a fairly solid one finger cream head that dissipates into a thin pool of foam.
Aroma is dominated by dank resiny hops, onion, grapefruit pith, and a cornucopia of citrus fruit. Pineapple, apricot, and mango ar supported by a hint of caramel malt.
Flavor is incredibly complex. Initially, bready malt leads the profile, with a hint of bitterness that gives way to an onslaught of citrusy hop. Makes my mouth water. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, tangerine, and apricot explode onto the palate, eventually subsiding to a resiny bitter finish that is slightly peppery, making me crave more.
Body is moderate with moderate carbonation and just a hint of alcohol warmth.
Overall, best apa I've had. If the bitterness were a bit more dominant, there's enough hop flavor to push the ipa envelope. 832 charactersbarczar, Apr 17, 2012

The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of pineapple and apricot notes, as well as some bread and biscuit malt. The flavor is just as good if not better. I get a ton of hop characteristics, including a lot of pine, orange and resin notes. There is also a good bit of bread and biscuit malt, and the bitterness level is low to medium. The beer is extremely drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 499 charactersMora2000, Apr 17, 2012

A hazy orange liquid with tiny bubbles popping up from everywhere even creating a tornado of bubbles from the bottom for the first minuet its in the glass, well retained off white foam leaves a few rings of lace followed by some random patches 
S big nose of tropical citrus, mango, passion-fruit, guava, and a little pineapple, just a little pine and toffee but its pretty much all within the tropics here 
T some malt balance I didn't smell with a little cracker and there's a little more rind then the fruity flesh on the nose but still a pretty tropical brew going one here and that works well for me 
M those tiny bubbles are paying off in a medium body with a lovely bitter bite and lingering earthy rind finish 
O my glass is empty at this point and I was typing fairly fast, what can I say? call it a APA, IPA whatever its a winner in my books

Wonderful uniform pinhead bubbles in the head, quite foamy but surprisingly settles very slowly for it's fist-full tall size. Off white picking up some of this real nice body color. Body color is just a slight haze but otherwise a real gorgeous clear orange tangerine color. Nothing sticking as bubbles to the side of the glass, some faint slow rising carbs in the middle the odd bubble. Slight hanging light clumps of icicles and glass lace. If it wasn't for this slight cloudiness in the body it would be perfect. Truly splitting hairs here.
Wonderful soft and chewy fruit citrus hop. Orange, grapefruit, pulpy rich but just a hint of subdued character. Faint green pine in the back, with a clean sense coming and hint of light character maybe as well. Feels big, but not in IPA territory. Melon comes out more after repeated quaffs.
Incredible feeling of fresh squeezed orange juice, with a light bodied palate. Malt and white sugar hits on the swallow with a great malt backbone that disappears in a flash, letting the hops character linger more and more. Hints of juice but controlled down, no fizzy character or gas, repeat tastes bring more citrus fruit basket quality. Orange, tangerine, cantaloupe melon character, so much going on.
It's full of hop character but light and not boozy. It's big but it's true to a pale ale root. Even at 6.2 it has a light session-able very low sensing abv quality. It is STUPIDLY drinkable, I could go through this six pack I swear with joy in under an hour... but I must control myself. Just flat out amazing. 1,667 characterssmakawhat, Apr 12, 2012

A: Pours a beautiful golden color. There is a foamy white head with just the right amount of retention for a pale ale. Lacing is lightly spotty on the side I am drinking from, and nice curtains on the opposite side.
S: Just some of the best smelling hops I've ever experienced. Waves of citrus and orange just leap out of the glass, with further notes of tropical fruits, grapefruit and pineapple. In addition to the fruit notes is a good dose of pine.
T: Just like the aroma, the taste is all hops. Still very heavy on the citrus and tropical fruits. Pine is much more prominent and is accompanied by some grass cuttings and herbal flavors. There are some *very* mild notes of caramel malts, but this really is all hops. The finish is crisp and with some slight hop bitterness.
M: Medium bodied with light round, almost foamy carbonation.
O: One of the best beers I have ever had. Most of the flavors come from hops, but somehow this is not overly hoppy. Just delicious. 1,017 charactersWankelEngine, Apr 11, 2012

Smell: Perfect. The most pure Citra hop smell of any beer I've ever had. Big notes of citrus and tropical fruit. Smells like you're holding citra hops in your hands. Hops interact well with bready, slightly caramelly malty notes.
Taste: Not quite as awe inspiring as the nose, but damn tasty. Bready, caramelly malt flavors are a little more pronounced than I would have guessed from the nose. Very balanced. Citrus and tropical fruit flavors are big and linger in the mouth. Very smooth. Juicy but dry on the finish.
Mouthfeel: Really nice. Well carbed but not prickly. Insanely drinkable. Easy to see what all the fuzz is about. Would be a staple in my fridge if I could get it regularly. 781 charactersjacewg, Apr 11, 2012

A- Beautiful golden orange color with light head that sticks to the sides of the glass and laces perfectly.
S - Pure fruit nose. Probably the best smelling beer I've ever smelled. TONS of fruit (mango, pineapple, and the like).
T - Taste is more of the same. Infinite mango and pineapple without being overly bitter. This is the beer to showcase exactly what Citra hops can do. Slight malt backbone to round out an insanely drinkable beer.
M - Perfect carbonation and slightly lingering bitterness that makes you want, nay, need to drink more.
O - This is probably the best beer I have ever had. It deserves this incredible ranking. If I were stuck on a desert Island and had one beer to drink forever, this would be it. Period. 922 charactersraveskdr, Apr 08, 2012

S: The greatest smell in the whole world to me. The Citra hops just explode on the nose and I can't think of a better smelling hop than this. Just so amazing!
T: Again so much flavor with the nice fruity hop flavor that lingers for a while. There is for sure a great malt flavor too, that is sweet.
M: Very smooth, with an enjoyable crispness on the tip of the tongue and the back of the throat.
O: One of the best beers I have ever had in my life. There is nothing lacking in this beer and I'm just blown away at how the hops fit perfectly. 689 charactersgtermi, Apr 08, 2012

4.55/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I'm generally not a huge fan of hopped-up APAs, so I'm curious to see what this one is like. Poured into a tulip.
Pours a very clear, bright, apple-juice golden-orange. One finger of off-white head, good retention, awesome lacing. Definitely an inviting beer.
Smell is fruity and piney hops galore. Citrus, pine, sweetness, all wrapped up in a lovely package. Loads of grapefruit (but juicy, not acrid like the peel), pineapple, and some resiny stuff in the background. Malts? I can tell they're there, because the beer feels plenty full underneath those hops, but I can't tease anything out of them.
Now I see what all the fuss is about. It's warm, full, and flavorful, with plenty of hop presence but not much bitterness. Not many hop-forward beers can pull this off - feels like heavy dry-hopping with not too much in the boil. Yum. Starts out slightly grainy and grassy, then tongue-tickling spicy pine comes in. Feels like it evaporates off the tongue.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Light, crisp, and well-carbonated, with a divine dry finish that just leaves a little bitterness lingering on the corners of the tongue.
A very light, flavorful pale ale, but without the bitterness of most IPAs. This is a really interesting beer, planted firmly between typical IPAs and typical APAs. I like it. It does the same disappearing act that Gumballhead does, where the beer simply vanishes from my mouth, leaving little trace of its passing. 1,436 characterszeledonia, Apr 07, 2012

A medium pour raises a tall head that slowly settles into a dense round clump in the middle of a Boston Lager glass. Hazed golden beauty with apricot highlights.
Strong smell of juicy fruits. Grapefruit, pineapple and resinous citra hops. The signature 3 Floyds scent.
Taste is same as the nose. Sweet citrus fruits bursting with flavor. A balanced and not too bitter hop bomb of a pale ale.
Goes down easy like a pale ale should. Smooth, moderately carbonated and refreshing. Lives up to the hype. I am lucky to live 45 minutes from the brewery as this is difficult to find. $8.75 per sixer at the Brewpub and twice the price at local stores when you can find it. 700 characters312HopBomb, Apr 06, 2012

Smell: sticky grapefruit and citrus up front, slight pine and lemon zest. a hint of mustiness that's not offensive. oranges on the back end.
Taste: grapefruit rind is dominant, lemon peel. extremely hoppy with little to no malt backbone which I expect in an APA. some may feel it's overhopped and this is definitely a strongly hopped APA. fruitiness lingers from start to finish
Mouthfeel: very dry in the end and nicely carbonated. the dryness lingers well after as well. This is superbly done. There is nothing heavy about this beer at all although the bitterness hangs on for dear life
Overall: There is nothing I don't love about this beer. Call me a fanboy. If put on a desert island this is my beer of choice. Not overly light as to feel like water but not so heavy as to feel weighed down. It's the perfect balance and could only dream of having this offered down the street on a regular basis. 1,067 charactersJHamm, Apr 06, 2012

Appearance is a glorious white foamy head that lingers and lingers on top of a sunny orange body. 
The aromas of grapefruit, orange, and resin are remarkable with the Citra hops. I love this smell - one of the reasons I love beer! 
Taste is all bitterness and hops. There is very little malt to support the hops. Overpowering with bitterness. I was hoping for better balance given the incredibly high rating of this beer, but again the hops are too strong in a Three Floyds beer. Perhaps it simply too much for my tastebuds since my friend loved it. A hop bomb for sure!
Mouthfeel is very dry. The finish is bitter and dry. 
Overall this one resembles Gumballhead - I did not have side-by-side, but on different days. The bitterness and the lacking malt to support it are what make these beers good to try, but not must haves to acquire again. 919 charactersZPB, Apr 04, 2012

Pours a slightly hazy bright orange color with two fingers of off white head that recede to a nice tight white cap. As is expected tons of citra hops on the nose, really bright citrus fruits and just a touch of dankness. No real malt presence on the nose. The taste is more of the same, tons of hops all over the place with a bit of a spicy bitterness on the palate. The mouthfeel is very nice, could have easily downed a 6 pack if I had it. Overall this is a great beer but I would have liked just a touch more maltiness on the taste to balance out the hops, as it is it came off just a bit harsh. Definitely worth seeking out if you are a hop-head. 688 charactersquirkzoo, Apr 03, 2012

Good retention and lacing throughout. The nose is an explosion of Citra hops in your face. Awesome. A large citrus and tropical fruit character with a hint of pine. Couldn't possibly be better. The flavor follows suit. Terrific. It's hard to think this isn't an IPA with the hop character. Again, the Citra hops explode on your palette. Medium bitter with a large tropical fruit, mango, grapefruit, pine tone. Again, I am not sure how this could improve. The light malt base provides enough sweetness to balance this out well. Finishes with a lingering citrus on the tongue. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. I wish I could have more and more and more. Highly recommended!! 828 charactershopfacebrew, Apr 03, 2012

A-Awesome orange glow. Solid white head that hold momentarily and then fades. Leaves a small white head above the body for much of the duration of drinking
S- A big old hop bomb. Tons of citrus and grapefruit coming off the nose. Even finishes a little piney. It is a fantastic smell. I wish my life smelled like this.
T- Holy hop hell. I know this is an APA but it has the hop presence of a full blown IPA. The bitterness is near perfect for the body. It is so grapefruity and citrusy it's ridiculous. Th taste hold
M-Perfect body for the style. It's not to thin, but not to heavy. The carbonation lingers in the mouth and can be felt long after the beer is gone
O-This is my first solo FFF offering besides a few of their collaborations. I am happy to have tried it I want this beer all the time and am jealous of everyone that can. I will trade for this whenever possible, or I could just move there. Awesome beer. 983 charactersBrewsoBrewco, Apr 03, 2012

12 oz bottle into a 3F pint glass. This was picked up in early July. Reviewing on 7/16/2012.
A - Golden clear amber body. Splotchy one finger off-white head. Really small and tight bubbles. Great lacing and retention.
S - Very grapefruit and mango heavy with some caramel malts. There is also a savory and danky spice to the aroma. A bit of grass and earthiness in the finish. 
T - More of the grapefruit and mango hops with that dankiness. Some caramel malts and a bitter finish, although the bitterness quickly washes away. Really awesome blend of citrus and tropical flavors with a pleasant spicy earthiness. Mouth feel is medium to light with nice carbonation.
O - Probably the best pale ale I've had, although I feel like 3F is stretching the category a bit as its pretty much an IPA. Having a fresh bottle certainly renewed my faith in the citra hop. 1,050 charactersdavey101, Mar 31, 2012

A: Pours a wonderful light honey color (slight reds, big oranges and yellows) with about one full ginger of pure white head. There is a good amount of lacing as it drinks.
S: The nose is sweet malt and big citrus (grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest). There is also a nice herbal yeasty undertone as well.
T: The taste follows the nose. It has a sweet start that transitions into bitter citrus hops. There is huge grapefruit, lemon zest, and orange peel. It's fantastic. There is a nice crispness to this beer as well. Fantastic.
M: Medium bodied beer. This brew has a bit of heft, but it's so damn refreshing that you forget how heavy it might be. The flavors engulf the palate but they don't linger too long.
O: This is a stellar beer. I loved it the first time I tried it, and I still love it today. I think it actually gets way better as it warms. A great APA all the way around. Cheers to FFF. 938 characterstrxxpaxxs, Mar 31, 2012
5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was given a case of this beer last year and have to say I was blown away. The appearance is spot on, the smell is so mango, fruity, sweet and hoppy that I couldnt resist about six of them in a sitting.
This is a beer that I would hang my hat on as being spot on perfect all around. I know people have their favorites but I have tried just about EVERY beer in this catagory and cant find one better. IF you have scored this beer high but couldnt go to 5 all across, what was stopping you? Are you waiting to find that one in the future? I think after trying and reviewing about 2000 beers from all over the globe (not on here of course) I have finally found that ONE.
This is what a pale ale in America should be. If not for the 4 million calories and a feeling that I need to hit the gym more regularly, I would have two of these every day.
Lacing is great, smell is great, taste is AWESOME and overall it all mixes together to be 3 Floyds best beer IMO.
If you have a favorite IPA or a favorite PA, you HAVE to give this a shot, and by the way, its ok to give it 5's across the board...i think this SHOULD be the benchmark. 1,130 charactersChris585, Mar 30, 2012

A: Alive and glowing. Orange body, white head, not shocktop.
S: Citra. 
Then some hop dry must/funk akin to simcoe (I know). Definitely at the Zenith of aroma for a pale ale. Wonderful smell, hoppier than the majority of IPAs.
T: Lots of citrus initially but further down the glass I get more lighter than water dryness from the hop profile---&gt;M: I feel like I'm drinking air. However the lighter body and lower alcohol vs. a standard DIPA bill (which is the level the hops are playing, and dominating, on) makes this beer thee definition of drinkable. Carbonation spot on, residual negligible. 
O: It's hard to look at you and say "You aren't perfect". I'm not entirely sure this is what an American Pale Ale is supposed to taste like either though 777 charactersCharlieMurphy, Mar 29, 2012

4.77/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I think the first thing that needs to be said about this beer, is the amazing label, a trademark of Three Floyds, but this one might be my favorite. The beer pours a great hazy honey color, hints of oranges, yellows and gold when held to the light. A nice finger and a half of soapy white head sits atop the beer that has mild retention but leaves really nice sticky webbed and spotted lacing. The nose is incredible, a big blast of citrus, heavy on grapefruit and sweeter tangerines or lemons. Some tropical notes come forward as well, mangos or pineapples that add additional sweetness but also some tartness. There is also a nice grassy, dank floral element from the hops that transitions nicely into the malt notes, that while faint, still come forward with some nice light breadiness. The flavors are great, big citrus elements, some flavors that, like Gumballhead, reminds me of cat pee, but in a oddly good way, with some nice sappy and sticky pine flavors. The breadiness is also apparent, which is a bit stronger than the nose leads on and finishes with a very dry, bitter and tart apple-y flavor that is oh so nice. The body is great, super full for a pale ale, but not overbearing in any way, extremely palatable.
Verdict: Massive triumph from Three Floyds. I don’t think there is a better pale ale in the world, it has all of the flavors and aromas of a strong double IPA while having almost none of the bitterness or alcohol and remains exceptionally drinkable. This is one to stock up on whenever it gets released, which is not often enough. 1,558 characterskevanb, Mar 28, 2012

Taste - Orange and grapefruit. Grainy malts in the middle, but again no sweetness. Touch of bitterness, but it's very low. Really delicious.
Mouthfeel - This is my only criticism. It's not bitter enough. I know it's not an IPA, but it's so hoppy that I want some of it to translate into bitterness. Totally light and drinkable. I need more.

A: Golden-bronze with a white head, some retention, great lace.
S: A great 'new-school' hop aroma, tangerine, lemon zest, chardonnay-like gooseberry aroma with a hint of cattyness.
T: This is mainly about the hops: Tangerine; lemon rind; piny resin; goosebeery, but there's some underlying quality malt that leaves hints of sponge toffee and biscuit. Solid bitterness, but not harsh. Alcohol sneaks up on you.

A - Pours an attractive golden amber color with about a finger of marshmallow colored head. Some cloudiness to the body. Great lacing. 
S - Fresh dank citrus is the prominent aroma in this beer. Some sweet caramel and buttered biscuit malts linger in the background. Tropical mango and papaya, along with white grapefruit, tangerine, and blood orange all contribute to the excellent odor. It smells alot like Heady Topper and that is an excellent quality. 
T - No surprises here as the grapefruit dominates from the start, displaying both tart and bitter characteristics. Sweet malts hit briefly midpalate, but they are soon washed away by a nice bitter pine and spicy citrus bite. There is some balancing bready malt in there somewhere. Phenomenal citrus linger literally leaves my mouth watering for the next sip.
M - Tingly carbonation with a pretty light body. Crisp finish and impressive drinkability.
O - It goes without saying that this is one of the finest APA (or IPA, if you want to make that argument) in all the land. Powerful citrus aromas and a great grapefruit flavor, undoubtedly from all of those citrus hops. If this were available in my area, it would unquestionably be my go-to hop-fix mid-ABV beer (a place currently reserved for Perpetual IPA and Evo Lot No.3 IPA). You don't need me to recommend it to know you shoudl drink this if you can get it. 1,594 charactersNoLeafClover44, Mar 24, 2012

4.62/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a great, slightly hazy reddish gold, with a smallish head. that reduces nicely, but doesn't dissipate. Some visible carbonation.
Wow. This beer really smell fantastic. Peach and mango are the strongest smells, but there's some pineapple and orange as well. This smells like perfect fruit juice. Sweet, but not unpleasantly so. It's Very pungent, and the smell just comes out in waves.
Taste is great, but doesn't quite live up to the nose for me. It's all the same flavors, but feels as though it's been watered down slightly. There's a nice grainy malt presence as well. Mild bitterness that makes you want to keep drinking. It's hugely drinkable and very tasty, but I wish it was just a bit bigger. This is pretty nitpicky though, as it's still delicious.
Mouth is exactly what I want. not too thick, with a really nice carbonation, it tickles the tongue on the way down.
This is easily my new favorite APA. The nose is definitely the high point for me, but it's really just all around great. Highly recommended. 1,024 charactersrodkin, Mar 20, 2012
4.62/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Whole Foods, ($4.00); keg tapped yesterday. Poured into Batch 19 tulip glass.
A: Clear amber, with very modest white head with big bubbles; head drops slowly and leaves sporadic lacing; sips are tracked by distinct rings; ongoing effervescence.
S: Very fresh fruit -- grapefruit, orange & tangerine; slight pine.
T: Tart grapefruit, lemon; some pine; moderate bitterness; no alcohol detected; complex.
M: Medium body and medium/high carbonation; juicy; neutral finish; no heat.
O: There's a lot to like here. It's an APA on the verge of being an IPA. Low ABV, with complex, but balanced characteristics; crisp and refreshing. A showcase for Citra hops and well-crafted ale. Well above the norm. 709 charactersbierbrauer, Mar 20, 2012
4.77/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5As I'm pouring this, outdoors, at arms length... Amazing aromas slap me across the face. Pours a nice light orange in color with a creamy white head. Leaves behind great lacing. 4.5
Super fresh citrus aroma. Smells like I'm squeezing oranges and tangerines. Some lemon zest and a hint of pine. Really amazing. 5
Surprisingly, the first thing I get is light caramel malt. But, this is immediately overtaken by citrus hops... Oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, and some crisp green apple. As the alpha acids build, there's more and more earthy, resiny piney hops. Full spectrum of balanced flavor here. 4.5
Just the right amount of carbonation to keep the hops oils crisp. 5
Overall, what a nice surprise this was. Beers like this are why I don't need session beers.... Only 2% more ABV but busting at the seems with flavor. Another great offering from FFF! 5 860 charactersAdrianized, Mar 19, 2012

a - pours a golden yellow with a nice, large 2-finger head. while it settles to a fine lace, it does so rather quickly - i would much like to stare at it longer...
s - holy hell. it's been quite some time since an aroma instantly pervaded the vicinity from the moment i opened the bottle. huge grapefruit, orange, pine tree aroma. massive. i want to smell this all day.
t - follows aroma. a perfect balance of nectar/bread sweetness, which when incorporated with the hops gives me the sensation of cold, juicy citrus fruit. it goes together so well.
m - thin enough to be quenching, yet thick enough to assert its substance.
o - i expected to be let down by this; after all, the hype surrounding this brew is massive. that being said, i believe this is the best beer i have EVER had - and i'm not saying this as some FFF fanboy, honestly i don't care much for their other beers. i want to drink this for the rest of my life (ok, not really, i do like my variety). i only hope i can enjoy other pale ales after having such an epic creation from FFF.
this is why i drink beer. 1,139 characterspsychotia, Mar 18, 2012

A - Slightly hazy apricot colored brew with a white foamy head and nice lacing.
S - Big grapefruit (followed by some other tropical fruit) and some bready malt. 
T - Tropical and earthy in the beginning with a good hop bite in the finish. Very drinkable. This is really excellent because it hits all the high notes a beer can, it is: complex in flavor, light on the pallet (with a big flavor), and refreshing.
M - High carbonation, medium body, and a slightly dry finish. Hop bite at the end helps add some body to this brew. It's interesting since it's creamy, yet quite crisp in the finish.
O - One of the best APAs I have ever had. Period. 678 charactersZombiesAteMyDog, Mar 17, 2012

A - ruby/orange body slightly hazed. cream white head half a finger thick settles to a ring. still puts up some good lacing.
S - big orange peel and grapefruit notes, blast of earthiness in there as well. tobacco, grass hops. very unique nosing and quite inviting.
T - earthiness is there again at the start. tobacco. orange peel pops in with big bitterness, grapefruit, grass. 
M - light to medium bodied with lots of carbonation. big hop pucker here. nice dry finish.

2012 vintage. No bottle date, but picked up from Three Floyds approx. 2 weeks before consumption. 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.
A: Hazy goldenrod orange body with 2 inches of fluffy white head. Great head retention and lacing.
S: Huge orange and grapefruit hop notes. I would say the orange dominates, which makes sense. A nice earthiness comes through as well. This smells fantastic.
T: Orange, grapefruit, earth, and cannabis notes. A nice lingering hop bite. This is pretty complex. I think the earthy notes dominate the citrus notes at times. I like that, but I don't love it.
M: Creamy, yet crisp. Just the right amount of carbonation. There is some depth to the mouthfeel: not too thick, but not too thin. The bite on the finish that I mentioned earlier is a nice touch.
O: To have this amount of flavor and complexity in a standard APA/IPA is really outstanding. Would I trade my cellar for this stuff? Absolutely not. However, I would never turn one down. This is a great beer. 1,065 characterstravMI13, Mar 16, 2012

a - pours a crystal clear, golden color with a pinky of sudsy, pale yellow foam. head retention is good, calming slowly to a thin cap and leaves thin, leggy lacing in the glass. 
s - tangerine, strawberry, grassy hops, toasted bread.
t - sweet, light citrus hop character over a toasty malt base. notes of honey, tangerine, berry, grass, faint piney bitterness. finishes crisp and clean. surprisingly complex, light and refreshing.
m - lighter side of medium body with the right amount of carbonation. 
o - this is one of those few beers that disappears from the glass. delicious and very, very drinkable. FFF might have just redefined the style here. get it if you can. 727 charactersdivineaudio, Mar 15, 2012

A: Pours with about a centimeter of head and yeilds a gorgeous golden color. A little bit of lacing is left as th head recedes. 
S: Fantastic. Hoppy/citrusy flavors dominate, which makes extremely excited to taste this...again. Also there is a slight hint of pear and/or apple in the scent. 
T: Really hoppy for a pale ale and it is great. I assume citrus hops are used to brew this beer which explains the bitter and citrusy taste. Citrusy lemon, orange, and floral notes are also evident. It is everything anybody could want in a hoppy beer. 
M: Very smooth not much carbonation, but just enough to keep it from being unpleasantly flat. I could drink this all night. 
O: This is the best pale ale I've ever had. 835 charactersareich6, Mar 15, 2012

Review from notes. Zombie Dust, an extra from an awesome trader, poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. No bottling date visible.
A: Pale gold, slight chill haze, good clarity, moderate effervescence, fluffy off white head, decent lace.
S: Sweeter tropical fruits, definite citrus presence, faint floral and grain, distant vegetable and astringent notes. It's good, but I'm a bit let down after everything I'd heard about this beer...
T: Sweet orange, citrus, peach, tropical fruit, juicy, light bitterness, light dryness, ghostlike biscuit malt.
MF: Tangy light-medium mouthfeel, a faint bitter dryness on finish.
O: Really nice and drinkable...enjoyable, and refreshing. Probably not my absolute favorite for an APA but right up there. Definitely a good Pale Ale, thanks Aaron! 803 charactersScotchboy, Mar 14, 2012

Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger off white head with nice retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge mango, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, light pine, floral, herbal spiciness, and apricot. Fantastic aromas here as expected from one of my favorite hops. Taste of big pine, pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, and herbal spiciness. Nice amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, herbal, and tropical fruit for a bit. Great malt balance makes this extremely drinkable. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed at all in the taste or finish. Overall this is an mind blowing pale ale.

A: Orangish color, about a half finer of white head that disappears rather quickly. Not as much lacing as Dreadnaught.
S: Hops, Citrus, Grapefruit and other tropical smells.
T: I had to take a couple sips of this to figure this out. It's certainly well balanced, the tropical fruits and hops go together perfect. However this particular type of hop I'm not as huge of a fan of. While they mesh well and finish clear, the flavors arent as promounced as I would have liked.
M: Light, good carbonation - very crisp.
O: It's definitely a good APA and for the price, I wouldnt disagree that it's the best in class. However I was hoping for a little more flavor-wise.

Lacing is equally stalwart. The bouquet of citrus hops is instantly delivered upon opening the bottle. Floral biscuit, near cherry blossoms over delicate grain. Very nice and such a pleasure when risking the often too tame genre of pale ales. The flavor brings an interesting combination of floral grain with a grassy finish. After the tongue has a couple moments to contemplate this, you get more of the citrus back and it ultimately presents a fine, sweet but reasonably balanced hop refreshment. Body is medium-light with a near slick feel and fairly delicate carbonation that crescendos to a mild froth in your mouth. Very drinkable and a fine entry for the pale ale world! I knew there was a reason I was determined to bring home some Three Floyds with me from Chicago last week! 928 charactersDurge, Mar 12, 2012

It pours a clear golden with a foamy white head.
Smell is well-hopped with some tropical fruit and citrus and only a small backing of malt.
The flavor continues the citrus and tropical combo. There isn't a huge amount of bitterness as the malts accentuate the hops.
I had 2 to make sure it was up to the hype... it wasn't. The second glass definitely was tastier though for what it is worth.

S - A strong pine enters my nose as do floral hops and citrus. Another look at the bottle because this smells like an IPA, the bottle mentions pale ale??
T - Again lots of pine, citrus and floral hops, incredibly tasty and easy to drink. The beer is full in body, dry and bitter, which make it an excellent thirst quencher.
M - The medium carbonation fits perfectly with the style. The finish is bitter and lingers around for quite some time.

Tropical fruit salad melange of honeydew, papaya, guava and rockmelon. Amazingly green and zingy flavours.
Light to medium body jazzed up by a lightly spritzy carbonation. Suitably short bitterness for a pale ale as oposed to an IPA.
As much flavour packed into a 6.2% drop as many IPAs pack into 9%. Massive drinkabilty. An impressive coup. 625 charactersspicelab, Mar 09, 2012

Notes from 03/02/12 
12oz bottle – pint glass
A: Zombie Dust pours a near perfect clear golden amber color with a half finger rim of off-white head. Leaves some wavey lacing upon the glass.
S: Smell is super skunky and in a good way. More like catty. Bright and sharp. Lemon peel, lychee fruits, and tropical florals. Some light sugary malts. Really great nose!
T: Tastes explodes with big bitters up front. Whoa - quite intense. Mangoes, orange flesh, pineapple, and evergreens. A bit of sweetened honey cracker maltiness really carries the brew throughout. Nar a trace of alcohol. Lingering pucker. Just juicy and resinous. Super hoppy. Great stuff. 
M: Light to med body with a good creaminess to it. Upper levels of carbonation. Super sticky resinous mouthcoat and a puckering dry finish.
D: Not exactly sure the way this works… Is it a Zombie repellant? OR more like it turns you into a hop Zombie because I am already wanting more. These 2 bottles received in trade were just a teaser!
The hoppiest brew I have had out of FFF’s for sure. Intense yet nicely balanced with a decent amount of malty sweetness. Very crushable. Really solid stuff.

Appearance; pours a lovely slightly hazy light orange/amber color with a finger of slightly bubbly pale straw colored head. Retention is good, and the head falls after a few minutes. Lacing is great with a ton of lace clinging in sheets to the sides of the glass.
Smell; holy grapefruit Batman!!! Zombie Dust features grapefruit by the ton, notes of pineapple and hints of resinous pine weave in and out. 
Taste; wave upon wave of grapefruit upon grapefruit washes over my tongue. As with the smell, pineapple and resins are beautifully interwoven with the grapefruit. Slight notes of orange and lemon rinds also appear.
Mouthfeel; a medium bodied beer, with just enough carbonation to compliment the feel of the brew. Might be a tad on the lighter side for this style but I'm sure not gonna complain about that.
Overall; WOW. An outstanding pale (PALE?!?!) ale that I would definitely stack up against any standard IPA, and quite a few DIPA's. There really isn't anything pale about this brew. Bravo FFF, this beer is incredible, drinkable every day without getting boring, but awesome enough to be a special occasion brew. I will absolutely seek this beer out again, and highly recommend that you do as well. 1,311 charactersThingus, Mar 05, 2012

T-The session beer of my choice from now on. (But its hard to get, thats a problem) Some intense grapefruit with layers of tropical fruit. Mango, peach, apricot, all in the background. A smooth bitter finish with a bit of sweet maltiness all balancing the perfect hop display. 
D- Very drinkable. All day. 
M- medium body with nice carbonation. 
This is a very special beer. 528 characterswildweim18, Mar 03, 2012
4.9/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I was overjoyed to see that Party Town had a small keg of this, which they sampled as part of their Friday Night Flights. Unfortunately, it came after 2 Barleywines and 3 IPAs, so when I tried it I could hardly taste it at all. Luckily, they sold pre-filled quart-sized growlers you could take home. Once my tastebuds had been given a chance to recover, I poured it from the growler into a New Belgium tulip. It was a slightly hazy, bright, apricot orange color with a nice, tight, 2-finger head that left huge lacings on the sides of the glass. The beer had a wonderful aroma with notes of sweet oranges, grapefruit, and cedar. Awesome!
The flavor is just wonderful. I get toast and sweet marmalade flavors first, then a perfectly balanced blast of hops comes in, providing tangy orange, peach, and lemon flavors. The beer has a medium body and the finish is wonderfully dry and lip-smacking.
This is easily the best example of an American Pale Ale I have ever had. It could easily hold its own against some outstanding IPAs as well. It is hoppy and complex enough for a seasoned craft beer drinker (which I still aspire to be), yet easy-drinking and accessible enough for a more casual drinker. I think it's a nearly perfect APA and an absolute masterpiece of a beer. I wish we could buy it here. 1,300 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Mar 03, 2012
4.11/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4As soon as I opened the bottle there was already a very clear hop smell, very much like an IPA which scared me a little as IPA's are the one type of beer so far that I don't like.
Once poured into a glass the beer has a really pretty dark honey colour with a small white head.
The smell still has loads of hop but I can also smell lots of tropical fruit and citrus in there with some hints of pine.
The taste is a little less hoppy than the smell although the hop bitterness is still there, especially at the start. The fruitiness is also more present now than it is in the taste, strong citrus and tropical fruit flavours once the initial hop bitterness fades. It ends dry and bitter with a bit of a pine flavour coming through.
Medium bodied and I would have liked a little stronger carbonation but it's not a big problem.
Overall I went from anxious when I opened the bottle to being very pleased with the complexity of the taste once I got used to hops.
It's not going to be one of my favourites as I'm much more of a fan of malts than hops but it's a really good beer. 1,074 charactersAethien, Mar 03, 2012

Poured into tulip.
A- Slightly hazy rich orange pour. Finger width soapy white head that recedes to a thin ring leaving glued on the glass rings of lacing.
S- Massive amounts of citrus; Grapefruit, mandarin oranges with a slight peel aroma. Citra gives off somewhat of a soapy aroma this is present in this beauty. There is a real astringent pine presence that is just magnificent.
T- Wow.. There is a wallop of citra blasting at you. Grapefruit, mango, mandarin oranges, lemon peel and a definite "soap" I honestly don't know how you can consider this a pale ale. It has the illusion of an over hopped IPA.
M- Slightly thin bodied which is par for the course. It is slight oily from the hops. Just wonderful feeling.
O- This really is remarkable. It never ceases to amaze me the limits brewers will push. I've been assaulted by citra yet my palate is fried for the night. 936 characterskorguy123, Mar 03, 2012

A - Light to medium orange with a huge golden glow. One finger of cream coloured head with moderate lacing. 
S - A huge hop aroma is evident even before putting my nose to the glass. Grapefruit, mango, tangerine, pineapple and a nice fresh, juicy hop aroma.
T - A sharp bitterness up front that really stands out while staying true to a pale ale style. Grapefruit, orange zest and lighter lemon and mango flavours. The malt base provides a hint of sweetness. The finish is bitter and dry.
M - Medium body; slightly creamy. Light to moderate carbonation. 584 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Mar 03, 2012

Clear copper in color Good head and a constant foam for all twleve ounces. Nice stickage too. OK bubbling.
Super bright citrus aroma, Citra hop showcased
well. Maks me think nof a mango and grapefruit had a babay, thats what it would smell like. The Citra hop dominates the aroma completely. No room for any malt aroma here. Not a bad aroma, just a little overwhelming. 
Full on tropical fruit (mango, pineapple..), pine, and grapefruit hop flavors. Maybe some biscuits popping up here and there in the flavor profile. Good hop flavor, just a little overwhelmed.
Resiny palate through and through. This citric flavor bomb is very easy to drink and worth drinking a few at a time, but not too many for me. My palate would be overwhelmed with citrus for weeks. 872 charactersscruffwhor, Mar 03, 2012

4.17/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Some things arrive in the darnest of places. In truth, I already knew that there were a few bottles of Zombie Dust at the apartment I was staying at in São Paulo, so I wasn't too shocked. A big thanks to Sergio (srbcurti) for sharing one of the bottles. On to the beer:
Brilliant orange color that lights up the room, topped by small puff of head. The nose is a beauty, no question. Bitter grapefruit starts off the show, then generous doses of mango and tangerine arrive with a thin coat of sugar coating. 
Zombie Dust is like running water through hops. It's quite bitter for an APA. White grapefruit starts it off. Bitter citrus, pineapple, and a dose of resin compliment the profile. The bitterness does tail off some, while makes it slighty more "juicy". It's medium bodied, with avery pleasant "bubbly" sensation, NOT like a champagne however, a different type. 
An intense hop experience. It is good, but not great as expectations led me to believe. I like my pale ales just a little more balanced than this. But it sure was fun to try! 1,047 charactersDoubleJ, Mar 02, 2012

4.89/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512oz. bottle purchased at Three Floyds brewpub, Munster, IN, served into a hotel stemless wine glass. 
Pours out the color of honey. 1.5 fingers of eggshell head form but fairly quickly dissipate. Dots of lacing get left behind. A good-looking beer, but nothing extraordinary.
Thankfully, you need only go as far as smelling this beer to find extraordinary. The aroma is fantastic in every sense of the word. If you smelled this blind you'd say that it was a very fresh IPA. Maybe more; this basically smells as good as HopSlam. But it is, ostensibly, an American Pale Ale. My mind is blown here. As soon as I opened the bottle there was pineapple and tangerine and passionfruit everywhere. It's very tropical. There's some green, bitter hop notes too; like grass clippings with some lemon zest tossed in. There's some caramel malt too, but only as much as I'd expect in an APA. It's an amount that bolsters the tropical fruits rather than takes away from them. I realize that a lot of beer probably fit the description I just gave. I'm not sure how to convey how great Zombie Dust smells. It's the intensity of the tropical aromas but also the level of balance. This is the finest smelling pale ale I've ever had.
It's also the best tasting pale ale I've ever had, or if it is not then only Alpha King ranks ahead. I'm going to give it to Zombie Dust. Alpha King is all about the grapefruit, while Zombie Dust is pineapple and lychee. If you prefer more tropical flavors, then this beer is going to blow your mind. Imagine all the best parts of a double IPA but take away the malt and alcohol. That sounds awesome, right? This is so packed full of hop flavor. But it doesn't get too bitter because there is a healthy malt presence here. In the way that I wish more IPAs or IIPAs would be: enough malt for structure and support, but not at all ""balanced" in the traditional sense of being as strong as the hops. This beer is a revelation. 
The mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Great carbonation level -- it's there but it isn't too prickly. The body is super-thin. Well, no, it's very appropriate for the pale ale style. It'd be thin in a good way if this were an IPA. Regardless, the mouthfeel does everything that it can to highlight those hops. My only fault is that it thickens up a bit during the swallow. 
Overall? Wow. If I have a better beer in 2012 then I will be a lucky man. This is the pinnacle of the pale ale style for me. I'd rather drink this than ANY India Pale Ale. The only hoppy beer that I would reach for before this (that I've had), honestly, is Pliny the Elder. Zombie Dust absolutely brings IIPA flavor into the best malt package possible _for my palate._ This is a dream beer. 2,704 charactersReaper16, Mar 01, 2012

Pours a clear honey orange with a 2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is fantastic with huge tropical fruit, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is also very tropical and citrus fruit forward with a citrus zest finish. The bitterness on the palate is fairly mild and sticks around but that's not a bad thing at all. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a very bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is simply a fantastic beer that beautifully displays the Citra hops in aroma and flavor. I am very happy that I finally got to try this one. This is one of the few beers that I would consider buying again and again if it was distributed near me. 818 charactersUCLABrewN84, Feb 29, 2012

4.4/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks chanokokoro for a 6 pack of this. Poured into a Weyerbacher tulip 2/26. From the latest batch I was told. Certainly seems fresh and delicious.
A - Crystal clear honey/orange color. Nice head that sticks around with great lacing. The carbonation is noticeable coming off the bottom of the glass. Looks really excellent, especially for an APA.
S - Smells like straight up fruit juice with some bitter hops. Like orange and all kinds of citrus. I've never had a brew dominated by citra hops before, and I really could see myself trying to make one if I ever get into homebrewing. Behind Heady Topper and a couple DIPAs, this is probably the best smelling beer I've had.
T - It tastes very citrusy and juicy. Bitter at first, followed by carbonated fruit juice and sweet malt, and followed by a nice dry finish. This is some excellent stuff. This destroys any APA I've had and would probably beat out any IPA I've had. This really could be considered either. If you are into citrusy IPAs, you will not be disappointed by this.
M - The mouthfeel is very smooth. At 6.2%, you can't taste the alcohol one bit. The bitterness really makes your mouth water.
O - This is the best APA/IPA I've ever had. I've had better DIPAs, and I really don't like to give out perfect 5s, which is why this is staying below that level. For the style, which is very key here, it is mindblowing. To get a better hop forward beer than this in my opinion, you'd need to have a top notch DIPA like Heady Topper, PtE, or another FFF brew Dreadnaught. It's really some spectacular stuff. I really wasn't expecting an APA to be this great, but I'm so glad I had the opportunity to receive this in a trade. It's too bad I only have a few left, because I'd drink this all the time. Gets a 5 overall because I think, for the style, this is as good as it gets. 1,835 charactersnrs207, Feb 27, 2012

3.45/5  rDev -23.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5From the bottle, the beer poured a copper color leaving a generous slightly off-white head. The aroma immediately tells you this is Three Floyds. The mildy skunky hop aroma is very present. It made me anxious to experience what the buzz is about Zombie Dust.
The initial taste is slightly peppery, though this quickly yields to citrusy flavors such as orange rind and pineapple. This melts into a dry aftertaste with a mild hoppy flavor. It seemed to me that I have had something like this before. It reminds me of Gumball Head, but without the sweetness of a wheat beer. Of course the hop profile is similar, as it has the distinct Three Floyds Hoppiness. 
For an APA, this is a good beer. On the other hand, it amazes me the way this beer is impossible for many people to find. As far as being an APA, there is nothing particularly unique or special. It is a little above average. 884 charactersJohnnyHopps, Feb 26, 2012

Amber hugh, pours big then settles quickly. Looks like an ipa or pale ale.
Bread, slightly sweet with some mango and pineapple overtones. Love the hop floral aroma. An oversexed pale ale on the edge of ipa territory. The aroma is very much like the taste. Very crisp and effervescent at the start, hops in the middle then clean finish. Balances on the edge of hopiiness and very drinkable. 
This is the best pale ale by far. If I could get this beer regularly, it would be a standby drink anytime beer. 
I like Dales Pale Ale an Daisy Cutter but this one just has an extra edge of hop aroma and flavor and complex flavor to make it unique in this style. 699 charactersDurtdiggler, Feb 26, 2012

Graciously given to me by Rochefort10nh, thanks man..
The appearance shows a nearly clear deep golden color with a frothy white head. Loads of lacing cling to the glass and tight rows of bubbles flow freely to the top.
Aroma is wonderful and full of citra hops followed by caramel malt and faint biscuit. Smells like a tropical buffett.
The taste is full of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon peel and a hint of caramel. Full of citra flavor but balanced nicely with sweetness. Very tastey, I could drink this all day.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a soft carbonation feel. Starts out smooth and creamy but in the end the true feel of bitter/dryness takes charge and begins it's assault on the tastebuds.
Overall an excellant example of the style and one I'm happy to review. My first experience with this beer was with Heady topper and Abner so my tastebuds were fried and didn't give it a fair shake. If you dig citra hops, than this ones for you. Definitely one of my favorite APA's to date. Nice job! 1,059 characters05Harley, Feb 25, 2012

Poured out of 12 oz bottle into CBS snifter.
A) Amber with haze. There was a full finger of head, which settled to a dusting. There was plenty of sticky lacing all over the snifter.
S) Absolutely top notch aroma. This had all kinds of sweet fruity quality. I was picking up really ripe peaches, white grapefruit, just a nice tropical blend. For me this was perfect.
T) Good malt/hops balance. The flavor is not as sweet and fruity as the nose, but it is tasty. There is definitely a grassy, piney, citrus rind to the finish and aftertaste. No alcohol noted. Really good...
M) More or less a medium body brew with moderate carbonation. There is some pine and rind tingle. It's pretty crisp and certainly refreshing.
O) This was really frick'n good. I could drink this anytime, but I'd love to have a nice stash of it for the summer. Cheers.... 895 charactersRoamingGnome, Feb 25, 2012

This may be my new gold standard of pale ales. Beautiful golden color with ample head and great retention. You can smell it from the moment the cap comes off and it blows up in the glass. Gobs of citrus hop aromas. Taste matches the rest: crisp, refreshing... just ideal. The only (very minor) drawback is that it's a bit drying on the finish, but that just means you have to drink some more.

The vision is a bit cloudy, mostly visible to light but what is awesome is the individual bubble cascades rising. They give this idea that its the perfect carbonation for a Pale Ale but not overly done. The retention time is BLAM SLAM dunk.
S- Tangerines, gentle pine breezes, citrus, grapefruit, lemon rind, lemon pulp. Its strong, its pleasant, it never overattenuates or bitters up. Its gentle, its forceful, its a lover who has never been scorned.
T- First pleasant flavor is a citrus burst. Orange juice with a biscuit middle. Its tropical... peaches, mangoes, a bit of pineapple. As it goes toward the finish its a mild bitterness that rises. The finish itself is a hidden rising of simple bitterness that is central to my tongue. Near perfect bitterness. The only thing that could make this beer better is a more filling middle.
M- Full bodied, smooth, creamy middle, bitterness that you can't argue with. Lingering, strong, velvety smooth and crisp right off the start that transitions to just velvet smoothness.
The best pale ale I've ever had. Arguabley will ever have. 1,193 charactersKhazadum, Feb 22, 2012

the nose is zesty with grapefruit lemon peal coming to mind. very citrus heavy with some light pie crust notes as well.
the taste is fantastic. the citrus character shines through big and it actually stings with acidity. a zinger for certain. the malt flavours are very subtle and this seems more like a deliciously bitter juice with just a hint of the aforementioned pie crust being the only notable malt descriptor. nary even a touch of caramel.
the body is perfect. for something so light on malt flavor and without any telltale caramel tones that give away the secret of bodybuilding, this somehow has a body and remains subtle and completely hop highlighting.
overall this beer is very nice. this style seems to fall by the wayside these days as IPA is quite similar to APA and also seems quite fashionable. this APA as well as the Floyd's flagship brew are both spectacular examples of how uniquely the style can be expressed to show contrast to the IPA and in quite delicious fashion. glad i had a chance to dance with this one. 1,356 charactersSupaCelt, Feb 21, 2012

Aromas begin with huge citrus, both juice and peel. Tons of grapefruit with a little bit of sweet, toasted bready malts. Mildly grassy on the back end.
The tastes begin with sweet malts, light toasted bread. Big citrus peel, pine and grassy hop flavor. A moderate level of bitterness to it and a hint of fruitiness. Nice solid flavors to the beer.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. Finish is mildly sweet and dry thanks to the ample dry-hopping I'm assuming.
Overall, this is a very easy to drink beer with great full flavors and aroma profile. While a pale ale it is not because in my opinion a pale ale shouldn't be over 6% ABV, it is a great IPA or just a great beer in general. Dangerously drinkable and full flavored. Glad I was able to track down a 6-pack for myself. Do I need to have it again, no. Do I hope I have the chance, yes of course. Definitely recommended though. 1,029 charactersclaspada, Feb 19, 2012

A: Pour golden orange with a nice off-white head that fades to a ring and leaves some decent lacing on the glass.
S: The nose has beautiful aromas of grapefruit, tropical fruits, and a slight onion aroma (not sure if it's onions but it's definitely dank). This smells like Dreadnaught mixed with Gubna which is impressive from a 6.2% beer.
T: The taste is sweet at first with caramel malt and tropical fruits but there is a nice hop bitterness on the mid-palate and finish. Great tasting Pale Ale!
M: The feel is actually heavier than I was expecting. Medium bodied with a nice creaminess.
O: One of the better Pale Ales I've had but not the best. I'd like to try it fresh on tap before giving final judgement though as the aromas and flavors seem to indicate the possibility of greatness. 819 charactersGregSVT, Feb 19, 2012

Pours a nice orange color in my tulip glass with an off white head. Good lacing on my glass. The nose has a very nice citrus vibe to it, along with caramel malt. Amazing taste to this brew- Hops, pine, w/ a nice malt backbone. Really incredible flavor for a pale ale. Feel is medium, w/ a nice hops bite. Overall, an another amazing FFF brew.

Okay, I'm gonna give this another fair and balanced review:
Bottled: recently I'm assured
Pours a golden ale with a finger of off white soapy foam that falls to a broken sheet of the same leaving some spotty lace. I am reserved about smelling....Alas, the smell I remember, lemony, citrusy zest and a hint of peach. So nice. Flavor follows suit with just a hint of alcoholic sharpness. Finish is sweet and juicy. Medium on thin with moderate carb and a watering finish. Much better this time around. Gotta say, this beer MUST BE FRESH, so far as I can tell.
Original Review: 11NOV11: 3/1.5/1/2/1 (1.3)
I’ve had this beer out of a growler, and it was one of the best APA’s I’d ever had. Too bad the transition here was flawed....heavily. 
Bottled: unk 
Pours a yellow straw with foam which falls rather quickly to a mirror of the same. Smells like: citra, grapefruit, citrus, more citrus?...NOT AT ALL!!! This smells like band aids and onions. Wow, god awful. Then the flavor is brutalized as well. Bitter, astringent, nasty. Body is fine beyond my clinching jaw. This beer is ruined for me.

Let's call this a session IPA in my book and a very freaking good one at that! Good bready bubble gum malt backbone here which "I Guess" gives it credit for an American APA. :-/
A - Blood Orange, not much head to speak of or retention but active in the tulip and Guinness perfect pint I've poured these in.
S - Very unique hop profile here. Like nothing else I've encountered. Straight fresh squeezed Grapefruit Juice and Bubble gum. Nuff said.
T - Much of the same. Very unique flavor and the best word to descrie this beer is as juicy juicy juicy! Enough juicy hop grapefruit flavor here to satisfy the biggest of hopheads! And sessionable to boot! Enough bitterness to keep getting through about 24 oz before it becomes too sweet from the malts...
M - Good, juicy sweet but here is the problem: This beer is GREAT fresh. Within 2-3 months of bottling, I'd bank my next month's rent (I live in SF) that this will become repulsively malty.
O - Let's compare this to the benchmark of the style, SNPA. While having a TON more flavor, I wouldn't want another Zombie Dust after 24 oz. On the other hand, I could drink SNPA until I puke...why, because the of the finish the SNPA provides...dry. Zombie Dust becomes too sweet and sugary, almost overly-so after a few. I'd take a 6-month old SNPA very muchso over a 6-month old Zombie Dust. To Zombie's hype train credit, the only other fresh APA's I'd take over it are RRBC's Row 2/Hill 56 and Drake's 1500 on tap. Drake's is argueable. 
Let's give ZD more credit, I need to revisit on tap. Very Very good beer!
Thanks rfraga77!! You, as always are the MAN. 1,665 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Feb 17, 2012

The taste has grapefruit, oranges, orange zest, pineapple, pine, and grassy hops. Not as sweet as the smell suggested. A good deal of bitterness, balanced by some sweetness.
Medium bodied with average carbonation. There is a bitter aftertaste, and this beer finishes dry. A very good Pale Ale, which I recommend trying if you get the chance. 546 charactershardy008, Feb 17, 2012

This beer has an amazing piney, citrus, skunk aroma. It smells like fresh hops.
The mouthfeel is medium and perfect.
The flavor is that of the quintessential pale ale. This beer is the new gold standard. A perfect citric bite mixes with a slightly sweet malt. The beer continues to coat your tongue and the hops literally dance on your tastebuds. The alcohol is invisible and it is dangerously refreshing.
I'm the first to admit that I am a three floyds junkie but this is without a doubt the best beer I have ever had. 10/10 565 charactersthydarkprevails, Feb 16, 2012

Proper pint
On-draft in Munster at Three Floyd's Taproom!
From notes.
A: Hazy golden amber. Single (white) fingernail head.
S: Bold citra hops, pine, and blend of citrus and tropical fruits. WOW! Faint hint of malt sweetness and loads more hops as I continue to smell this very inviting beer.
T: Hops up-front and all throughout with smooth balance of pine, grapefruit, and orange zest. Hint of biscuit malt and lemon juice at the end balance bitterness of so nicely.
M: On the heavier side of light-medium bodied (slightly chewy) with moderate carbonation. 
O: I first enjoyed this beer at DLD 2011 and was blown away. To-date, I continue to be amazed at how simply awesome it is. So crisp, clean, and refreshing. Not too overpowering in any aspects, but articulate all-around. Bravo Three Floyds on another great beer! 839 charactersspdyfire83, Feb 14, 2012

I have had this one multiple times on tap and absolutely loved it. Now it's the bottle's time to shine.
Pours a light, clear amber color with 2 fingers of white head. Sticky strings of lacing clings with durability.
The nose, my sweet Christ, the nose! Sweet citrus notes light up the party here. Lemon and clementine zest, pineapple & mango, along with that sharp, trademark fff fresh hop scent. Heavenly is an understatement here.
The taste is a sweet/bitter gush of juicy citrus fruit and a bit of sweet malt that is balanced nicely against the hoppy blasts. Citrus explosions that would make a rainforest jealous.
The mouthfeel has a nice crisp zest to it along with a light-medium body. Moderate carbontion that is perfect.
Overall, this is my "stranded on an island" beer for sure. I could drink this all day, every day. Nuff said 854 charactersChugginOil, Feb 14, 2012

4.47/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Many thanks to Dyan for the opportunity to try this excellent beer.
The beer pours an orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is just amazing in this beer, and I assume is the result of a "whole bunch of" citra hops. In any event, I get orange citrus, dank weed, light pine, and a hint of leather. This kind of nose would be impressive in an IPA, but in a pale ale, it's just astonishing. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, and I'm impressed by how dry and bitter this beer is on the finish. There's so much flavor in this beer, and yet at the same time it's light and refreshing, begging you to drink more, and more and more (except I only have the one bottle). There's just enough malt to keep all the hoppy goodness in check, and drinkability is just exceptional. For all that, this beer comes across as very well balanced, and alas my one bottle was gone all to swiftly. Just an all around delicious beer that I wish was available where I live.
Sampled on tap at the 3 Floyd's pub in 3/13. This beer was every bit as good on tap, and as with the bottled version, is a beer I would order all the time if it were only available where I live. 1,190 charactersJohn_M, Feb 13, 2012

Pours a deep amber with great head and lacing. Aroma is pine and intense citrus - grapefruit, mango, lemon are all there to overwhelm the olfactory. Taste is full of juicy fruity and piney hops, with a substantial malty backdrop. Mouthfeel is resinous and sticky with dry finish. As noted elsewhere, a beer of this description seems like it should be classified as an IPA. Whatever you call it though, it is magically delicious. 544 characterscoldriver, Feb 12, 2012

A - Gorgeous. Slightly hazy copper with 1-2 finger white head that lasts forever. The head never fully dissipates, it only reduces to a 1-2mm thick coating on tiny bubble floating on the surface of the beer. Exceptional lacing.
S - Aroma is massively hoppy with grapefruit and pine out the wazoo! Mango and other tropical fruit aromas are included and complemented by a sweet bready caramel malt backbone. Great aroma
T - Such a perfect pale ale, I am floored. Bready and sweet malts meet up with intense citrus hops. The malt profile presents you with rustic bread, toasted grain, and sweet caramel just starting to burn. Hops include grapefruit, mango, and a touch of pineapple. The toasted grain finish is beautiful.
M - Medium body, perfect degree of dryness in the finish. Envelops the entire mouth and engrosses the drinker.
O - This beer is a revelation. I went into this beer thinking it'd just be an IPA with an APA label on it. I was wrong. IT is very much an APA with a more hop-forward profile, but retaining not only a balance with the malt, but also a strong and flavorful malt presence overall. 1,145 charactersgreenmonstah, Feb 11, 2012
4.82/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a pint glass an enjoyed on 2/10/12. Bottle courtesy of Treebs.
Appearance: Light orange color with a one finger head that recedes fairly quickly to the top of the pour. Still, lacing is top notch. 
Smell: So much hop freshness on the front end. Piney scents mix with tropical and citrus notes for a potent scent. Literally can smell this one from a foot away. 
Taste: Similar to Gumballhead in taste with lots of citrus and tropical flavors. There has to be a significant dosage of piney hops in there too because it's a resiny and sticky finish. Hop profile is complex and unique. Delicious. 
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, oily, and really no sign of alcohol. 
Overall: Not really sure why you can't call this one an IPA. In any case, this is one of the best self-described APAs I can remember drinking. Totally drinkable, flavorful hop profile, and thirst-quenching. 881 charactersmfavoino, Feb 11, 2012

Pours a light golden wheat color with an orange hue. Half inch egg shell white head that quickly dissipates into soapy bubbles. Leaves an oily lacing in it's wake.
Smells of pure hoppy goodness including citrus rind, grapefruit, pineapple, mango a real tropical cornucopia. I also detect a bready malt quality.
Tasts of everything mentioned above as well as some tropical flavored teas. A well balanced beer with earthy pine notes.
Mouth feel is full. It leaves an oily coating in the mouth with just the right amount of carbonation fore me. Also light and refreshing

That's a good start in my book. I purchased the six pack at the brewery the day that batch was offered to the public. This is a four day old Zombie Dust....
It pours tangerine orange with excellent clarity. The head is a robust mound of uneven sticky eggshell foam. Retention and lacing are excellent. 
The aroma is loaded with fresh tropical citrus hop flavors. It seems similar to Gumballhead, so perhaps Amarillo hops contribute to the massive pineapple, mango, and grapefruit tones. The IBU's have to be on the upper edge of what's detectable with this much resiny, vinegary, soapy presence. The grain in the backbone is evident, but only to support the bold hop bill. 
Flavor exemplifies heavyweight balance. Huge grain flavors of grape nuts, real nuts (almonds), oats, and wheat bread have a surprisingly bold presence, especially in the finish. Hop profile leans more on grassy and resinous than the nose, yet fleeting blasts of sweet citrus tones come and go. 
No doubt about it, the mouth feel is big. It's sticky, viscous, and chewy. Carbonation is mild and the finish isn't as dry as many. It's considered a pale ale, but drink it fresh and you'll consider it delicious. It's nearly as ominous as it's label. 1,334 charactersclimax, Feb 09, 2012

4.52/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A huge thank-you to my friend @rickyleepotts for picking up a case for me while he and his girlfriend were up in Chicago this past weekend. I've had a ton of incredible, highly rated beer since the last review I wrote (including Pliny the Elder, Hopslam, Consecration & Supplication, Ten Fidy, etc.), but for some reason this beer inspired me to write another BeerAdvocate review.
Incredibly fresh bottle poured into my new fat-bottomed Bell's tulip.
Zombie Dust pours a beautiful, slightly pale golden color that's brilliantly clear with a mild effervescence and a small creamy eggshell-white head that dissipates to a thin film. Spotty, clingy lacing adorns the glass. Aroma is like sticking your nose in a freshly-opened hop bag. If you're not a homebrewer or have never sniffed fresh hop pellets, this beer is essentially exactly that same aroma. Huge, raw, green (both in vegetal quality and young-beer-freshness), citrus and pine and grass. A liquid monument to the Citra hop in a glass. The flavor is more mild than the nose would suggest, but is still a total hop bomb. Incredible hop flavors that mirror the nose, if not slightly more floral. Creamy, full mouthfeel that's just spectacular with the perfect amount of carbonation. Finish is a quick flash of earth, orange & grapefruit rind, grass, with a mild, biting bitterness throughout.
This is truly an epic beer, and it pairs with spicy food beautifully. But contrary to the normal mantra regarding hoppy beers, I honestly think the green hop characteristics will mellow out and improve with a few weeks of age and turn Zombie Dust into a much more balanced beer, instead of the I'm-Drinking-A-Raw-Hop-Cone that it is right now.
Ultimately, I think @yourefragile sums it up best:
"Aroma is green, fresh and raw. Citrus rind, grapefruit pulp, mild pine, and light caramel malt. Medium thick, chewy body with moderate carbonation and a slightly wet, thin finish. Strong biscuit malt and earthy body with resiny and pulpy citrus hops buttering the finish. An exceptional, citrusy APA..."
The Cimmerian Sabertooth Berserker of the APA world. 3Floyds does things with hops that is just on a completely different level, and they've struck gold again with Zombie Dust. 2,231 charactersmachostacos, Feb 07, 2012

Pours a chilled golden orange with a slow stream of carbonation supporting an initially thick cream head. Fades to a thin layer with extensive sheets of lacing. Aroma is green, fresh and raw. Citrus rind, grapefruit pulp, mild pine, and light caramel malt. Not quite as aromatic as some of the HF APAs, but very well balanced and nuanced. Medium thick, chewy body with moderate carbonation and a slightly wet, thin finish. Strong biscuit malt and earthy body with resiny and pulpy citrus hops buttering the finish. An exceptional, citrusy APA, but a little too much alcohol presence for the style and not quite Hoppy Birthday or Edward. Regardless, I will seek this out every time it is released. 758 charactersyourefragile, Feb 04, 2012

12 oz bottle into a grand bordeaux wine glass.
A: Orangey amber in color with a finger of bright white head on a gentle pour that recedes but sticks around the edges for the entire drink. Great lacing.
N: Great nose, very complex for a pale ale. Sweet malts up front with honey, tea, citrus, pretty great hop character behind the gentle sweetness. 
T: Quite good. Very well balanced between hop and malt characteristics. Bitter citrus hops up front with a brief intensification of the bitterness mid palate, then some bready malts behind that, rounds itself out with a subtle refreshing bitter aftertaste. 
M: Good. Appropriate carbonation, smooth. Refreshing. No alcohol heat.
O: Wow, this is probably the best pale ale I've had. I was expecting something à la Sierra Nevada (which I like) but this is so much better. Very well balanced between hop and malt, very approachable and not overly bitter. Would be a great intro to craft beer as well as a special treat for the seasoned BA. Highly recommend. This is my first experience with Three Floyds and damn, I'm impressed. 1,115 charactersbeerbiatchMD, Feb 03, 2012

S - Citrus, mango, pineapple, orange. This smells like a tropical heaven!
T - Citrus hops abound such as pineapple, mango, orange, balanced nicely with a slight malt backbone.
M - Medium bodied with good carbonation.
O - Fantastic APA from FFF. This one lives up to the hype and may very well leave Alpha King in the dust with this one. Great pale ale that drinks very similar to an IPA. 493 characterspigc, Feb 03, 2012

Pouring a clear orange with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and lacing, this beer looks great. The nose is just a great expression of the Citra hops. Fresh, vibrant, citrus hop character with some tropical fruit, orange blossoms and pine. Mildly floral as well. Not much malt character is present, but as it warms up, there is a little bread, caramel and a touch of sugar.
Like the nose, the palate is quite the riot. Exceptional balance between bittering and flavor hops, there's a wonderful amalgamation of tropical fruit (mango, papaya), ripe oranges and just a touch of pine. Just enough resin too, to amplify the fruity hops. Mild malt character is present, with a little bit of caramel and bread. As it warms up, the malt character comes out a little bit more, with a little sugar. Medium light in body with moderate but creamy in carbonation, this beer has a wonderful long-lasting finish with excellent balance between a clean bitterness, plenty of fruity hop flavor and a mild resin character. However, there's just a touch of chalkiness on the palate, especially on the finish, that makes the finish not quite as clean as I'd like. I wonder if it's the water profile or hop grassiness, but it does stand out. Quite quenching, this is a thoroughly enjoyable beer, though the alcohol is a little bit higher than it needs to be. 
Not quite as good as Hoppy Birthday or Parking Violation, but this is very, very close. Exceptional, especially when this fresh. Highly recommended. 1,690 charactersDefenCorps, Feb 02, 2012
4.48/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a brilliant orange amber that is complete see-through. Nice, puffy 2.5 finger head that dissipates so slowly and leaves a good amount of wavy lacing.
S - Full nose of grapefruit, orange, and even a touch of pine. Actually a little kick of zest in for good measure. Just so slightly some bready malt. 
T - It's a very full taste, but not especially hoppy like an IPA. It's interesting they were able to pull this off so well. Very floral and grassy with a good bit of grapefruit and citrus before it finishes with a final kick of resiny bitterness. Again, the taste isn't "in your face" like an IPA or DIPA, it sets in the background, lets the malt play a role, and provides a good hop balance.
M - Leaves the mouth a bit dry from the hop kick, but actually very full and robust.
Overall - Superb. Among the very best, if not the best, APA out there. I was wondering if someone would be able to pull off such a bold APA, but Three Floyds did. Simply delicious. 973 charactersBeerBuckeye, Feb 02, 2012

A: Nice hazy orange hue with an IPA appearance. A little more hazy than the last APA I drank. Two finger creamy white head.
S: Unbelievable! So much citrus and floral notes. Smells hoppy, yet balanced. 
T: Once again, FFF hit a homerun with this beer. Hops at first, followed by citrus, pine with a nice finish. Very drinkable!
M: Smooth and medium mouthfeel. Goes down very easy with a wonderful finish. Extremely light finish.
Overall one of the best beers I've had the chance to drink. My new favorite FFF beer, taking Alpha King's spot. Reminded me of a single American IPA, but not overly hoppy. One of the best of all time! 776 charactersbsu2005, Feb 02, 2012

Appearance: Golden, amber hued with a small cream head after a moderate pour. Luminous and inviting. Certainly errs more towards the appearance of a DIPA over a APA.
Smell: Bouquet blossoms with citrus and hoppy grass notes. Slight hint of light malt but primarily citrus, pineapple, grapefruit.
Taste: Initial taste is bitter, astringent citrus, grapefruit juice followed by creamy grass and pine notes. Copious amounts of hops, and an evident balance of lighter malts. The citrus resounds in the forefront exceptionally. The finish bitter, yet refreshing.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, full, astringent, no alcohol heat. 700 charactersTrystero, Feb 01, 2012

Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Pint glass
Zombie Dust has a glowing orange appearance. The head quickly dissipates and less than a millimeter of foam is left around the edge of the top of the beer. 
The scents I've picked up from this beer include lots of citrus fruits, lemon, grapefruit, orange. 
Taste is pretty good with only a slight touch of bitterness that doesn't linger long enough to throw off the overall taste of the brew. All the citrus components in the scent are there with the taste as well. The alcohol is hidden very well also.
Mouthfeel is easy going down, very smooth and velvety for an APA. 
Overall- I enjoyed this brew but I didn't really find anything too incredibly special about it. I enjoy most of the beers this brewery puts out but all the hype I've heard about Zombie Dust just didn't live up to my expectations. 933 charactersDoodlesby, Jan 30, 2012

Poured a dark amber gold that was fairly non-translucent and appeared to be totally filtered. A thin bone white lacey head faded to an inconsistent ring around the glass. First smells are amazing! A citrus punch with aromas of grapefruit, mango, tangerines and more! No malts in sight! The tastes reflect the smells with a nice citrusy bitterness. All hops! It's hard to believe this is only 6.2% abv. It seems a bit heavier... in a good way. It's crazy to think that this was even better when it was fresh because probably a year later it's nothing short of awesome! A must try.
Enjoy!

Updated 3/16/2012
With a fresh bottle of this brew in hand (2012 bottling), I noticed it poured a light/medium amber color. The great citrus hop flavor is definitely intact! Amazing. Haven't have a PA yet that beats this one.

4.92/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big review #10!
In a year dominated by a ton of absurd releases this is the 2011 beer that really stood out in my mind.
a: Sexy. Nice head, nice copper/orange color - looks like a killer IPA. Shocking, that.
s: I prefer citrus forward IPAs, but this has kind of a balance of citrus and flower and really stands out as a nice middle of the road (in a good way) IPA aroma. Orange peel, apricot, some sort of flowers... all good.
t: boom. So damn good. As a person who prefers other styles over IPA I'd drink this all day long. It delivers on the promise of the aroma in a big way with nice citrus and floral components . It's not the big bitter I expect from the west coast and it's not the big cirtus that I associate with Ohio, but it balances the two and makes a great all-around IPA taste that I just love. Little bit of pepper, just the right amount of sweetness to balance the bitter - the details just round out the package.
m: damn near perfect. An American IPA should excite the taste buds and tingle the tongue. This does both. It is easy drinking - I'd go as far as TOO easy drinking. I wouldn't think much of drinking four of these in a night though that is way more beer than I'm likely to consume in the average night. The mouthfeel is a huge piece of that. It tastes great, but if it doesn't feel good going down I'm not going more than one. And each night I've opened one I've gone for a second. Drinks so damn easy.
o: THE American IPA. Best of class. Done. Three Floyds strength seems to be in the IPA realm and this is yet another jewel in their crown as one of the Kings of midwest IPA power. 1,616 charactersnormyk, Jan 23, 2012

A. Pours a beautiful orange color, almost the same as the McDonalds orange soda from when you were a kid. Light foam head, about 1mm thick, settles to a light thin ring.
S. Smells of sweet citrus, fine northern pine, and lots of orange peel
T. Tastes of sweet orange peel, wonderful citrus and trangy fruit, with a hint of pine
M. Medium body, slightly water, a little bit coarse with a nice light finish.
O. This is a very good beer. Tangy and sweet, not as much like a normal IPA, but still very goo. I would suggest everyone try this at least once. 595 charactersMBrausen, Jan 17, 2012

m - slippery, almost coating; medium carbonation with a very light mouthfeel overall

Appearance - Clear light copper colour with a large size fizzy white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation and there is some great lacing. The head lasted for over 5 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Malts, caramel, hops, grapefruit, lemon, apricot
Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and most of the taste is made up of caramel, hops, and malts. There is also some grapefruit, lemon, and apricot flavour mixed with a touch of pine. It ends with a very hoppy citrusy aftertaste.
Overall - A delicious beer that has a fantastic balance of flavours. It really drinks more like an IPA than a APA. It reminded me a bit of better made Flying Monkeys Smashbomb IPA. Worth seeking out and I'd drink it again anytime. 807 charactersspinrsx, Jan 16, 2012

Tastes amazing, a little bitter floral hop, citrus and malt work together balanced perfection
Crisp beginning and smooth all the way through, 6.2abv nearly undetectable drinkability of this is dangerous
Overall - an instant favorite! It's one of those beers that give you an involuntary/uncontrollable smile with the first taste.

The pine aroma really kicks you right in the face; I got it when i first pulled off the cork. Aggressively dry hopped, this one is. 
Pour is a nice orange color. Initial head was very fizzy and off white. Very nice carbonation.
The first thing that comes to mind is Boston Lager, but more assertive. Dried West Coast Hops are running rampant. Grapefruit, lemon zest, and orange peel come to mind. Subtle sweetness in the background. Very complex on the nose.
Its actually very balanced. A sticky honey malt is highlighted by a good bit of fruity hops. Grapefruit, lemon zest, and nice touch of orange peel. A nice bittering presence is actually a lot less than the nose leads you to believe, but thats actually a very good thing. Slightly metallic. Sits very light and all the flavors fade away leaving the hints of bitter and metal. 914 charactersVncentLIFE, Jan 14, 2012

A- Pours a medium amber color with a 1/2 inch of white head. Plenty of lacing as the head unwinds to a 1/8 inch ring around the edge of the glass and spotty surface foam. 
S- Sweet, fruity, yet pungently grassy hop aroma AND cereal grain sweetness in the tail-end. Also known as having your cake and eating it too.
T- Intensely grassy hops smack down on the palate and cause tingles of bitter to spread out across the tongue. Definitely a powerful taste but has that restrained quality that other stellar IPAs have in common (Two-hearted to name one). As sweet as it is hoppy with the just-right amount of malt presence holding everything in place. Notes of pineapple and grapefruit.
M- Prickly and active with medium carbonation. Also quite full in body and wetness.
O- Now I see what all the hype's about. One of my new Top 5 IPAs for sure. Definitely cannot improve anymore. 1,012 charactersImmortale25, Jan 06, 2012

A: 2+ fingered khaki colored brew that has good retention dissipating to a thin soapy film atop this golden edged, orange cored brew.
S: Fresh pine a floral hops are at the forefront, but are followed by subtle tropical fruit notes and candied malts.
T: As the smell indicated pine and floral notes dominate the front. Biscuity malts and passion fruit follows and took me by surprise since I didn't detect them in the smell, truly remarkable combination. Bold bitterness rounds it all off and persists in your mouth long after each tasting.
M: Silky smooth and well carbonated medium bodied brew.

No dating info on bottle but my buddy bought at the brewery just after the release. Was a hazy, orange amber with moderate carb streams.

The aroma was exceptional. Really loving the citra hop. Bold citrus aroma with grapefruit and tangerine leading. Can get a little of the malt backbone but this a marvelous hop show. The taste follows the aroma with big, bold citrus flavors with enough malt to keep it smooth. Could drink this all day. Medium mouthfeel with good carb and aftertaste. 
Overall, this is one of my favorite releases over the past several years. Lives up to the hype and beyond. Most highly recommend. Not avail here in TX so got from ummagum - many thanks! Rotation - if available near me it would be a constant presence in my fridge and probably would get a keg if available. [H;Y] 967 charactersTexIndy, Jan 03, 2012
4.89/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got this in a beertrade. very excited! Poured from bottle into Bruery tulip. Appearance is a bit cloudy but otherwise golden. Vigorous pour yields good carbonation and a decent head which quickly fades to a thin ring. 
The smell. Dear god the smell. It's dank. It smells of wet, piney, resiny hops. My mouth is watering. The taste is outstanding. This is a beer for hop lovers. I can't believe this is just a Pale Ale. It absolutely blows everything out of the water.
Mouthfeel is great. Easy drinking. I really wish this was distributed. Overall, this is simply outstanding. Believe the hype. This is a damn good beer. 621 charactersUnknownKoger, Jan 02, 2012

Poured into a Mother Earth Snifter
Pours darker than I was expecting for an APA
Smell is nice, citrus and pine fresh hops
Taste is very assertive and big for an APA
taste more like an IPA but not overpowering at all.
Mouthfeel is surprisingly full, almost chewy
Overall a great APA from a World Class Brewery! 347 charactersHopDiggityDawg, Dec 31, 2011

Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Mother Earth pint glass.
A ~ Orange/Hazel look with a 1 finger white head, no lacing.
S ~ Strong citrus scent, but really not overpowering. Pleasently greeted by pine, hop, orange notes.
T ~ Peppery burnt grapefruit start that fades into a citrus after taste. Carbination is good, but a little strong up front. Surprisingly piney with a hint of orange as well. 
M ~ Thick and surprisingly creamy but I can't get past the carbonation. It's thicker than I expected, which catches you off guard since the look is more clear than a traditional American Pale Ale.
O ~ I love hoppy beers and to be an American Pale Ale, this one is hoppy! Reminds me of an IPA that isn't as overpowering with floral if that makes sense? Good overall beer that would be a go to if it were distributed to NC.
Cheers! 909 charactersUNCCTDawg, Dec 31, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks UncleJedi!
A- Body is a translucent orangish color. Pours with a 1-2 finger head that eventually fades to 1/2 finger or so. No lacing is left behind in the glass.
S- Nose is pretty bright and hoppy. Bright grapefruit and citrusy hops. In the background is a mild spiciness.
T- Flavor is very similar to the nose. Lots of citrus upfront with a hint of spicy hops underneath. The finish is suprisingly dry with a mild hint of spices.
M- Medium carbonation and a smooth dry body.
O- Overall this is a good beer. Lots of grapefruit and hops with little accompaning bitterness and a suprisingly dry finish. Very happy I tried this beer. 643 charactersPittBeerGirl, Dec 31, 2011

Served chilled in an over sized wine glass.
Thanks to pittsburghkid66 for this amazing extra from the top of my want list! 
Appearance: Wow, quite a bit darker than I was expecting; this looks quite like an IPA. Lightly clouded apricot orange body topped by a good sized white head that displays reasonable retention and leaves good lace. 
Smell: I have no experience with Citra hops so this should be interesting. Wow, from the second the cap was cracked I could tell that this is going to be a great beer! The nose is all hops - Orange, grapefruit, mango, peach, under ripe guava (wtf!!!), mild pine, grass and a leafy herbal quality basically sums it up. Closer inspection reveals a very light caramel note. I know this is my first experience of Citra, but it is already up on my list of favorite hops! 
Taste: Hmmmm, this tastes quite like the single hop (Amarillo) IPA that I made last year... Maybe my true calling is as a brewer and not as a mathematician - well at least I hope it is!
The initial flavour is sweet malt, but this is quickly overrun by citrus, tropical fruit and strong grassy notes. Solid bitterness and lasting flavour. 
Mouthfeel: Bang on for the style; medium body, lightly oily with moderate level of carbonation. Easy drinking and super refreshing. 
Overall: Great beer, I would drink this throughout summer if I lived near FFF. One thing though; why do FFF bottle their huge IPA's like Apocalypse Cow in bombers and their refreshing pale ale in a 355ml? 1,518 charactersThehuntmaster, Dec 30, 2011

Appearance: Shiny copper like new pennies. Head is creamy, bright white and clings. Carbonation is present, but not overwhelming. Head retention is insane. A nice cap lingers throughout the duration.
Smell: Tropical fruit laced with some pine and grapefruit. Nice malt compliment is slight bready with a good touch of caramel. Very delicate nose, but full at the same time. None of the aromas are overpowering. Big juicy tropical fruits - mango, pineapple, and some fresh orange. So much juicy hops, but the malts actually balance it. 
Taste: So much tropical fruit. It's all there. Mango and pineapple in abundance. Some grapefruit flesh and juice mixes with orange. It's fruity and delicious. Slight floral edge. Malts are in perfect balance, adding some nice sweetness to the whole thing. Biscuits and tropical fruit. Slightly earthy and is that a touch of mint I encounter?
Mouthfeel: Nice moderate body with a smooth, crisp carbonation. A touch dry on the back. Drinks clean and clear with a slight lingering bitterness.
Overall: Yup, hype is on point. Tons of flavor, but nothing overbearing. Surprisingly balanced and incredibly drinkable. Also, Citra single-hop has to be once of the best ideas on the market. Bonus points. 1,283 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Dec 28, 2011

Pours a hazy light orange color with a big bubbly white head. Great head retention, surprisingly little lacing.
Aroma is great. Citrus and tropical fruit (mango etc). Very strong, very nice.
Tastes great as well. A full blast of citrus and tropical fruit flavors without a harsh or bitter "bite". This is an APA not an IPA and it shows. Just enough bitterness to satisfy a hop head. Very drinkable.
Mouthfeel is rich with a good balance between bitterness and drinkability. Goes down easy. No hint of alcohol.
Overall, an outstanding beer 638 charactersJayQue, Dec 26, 2011

4.84/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Light orange and gold pour, a pretty decent appearance head wise despite the hoppiness. Aroma is luxurious. Massive citra hop aroma. Big big big, even before you pour it. 
Taste, plenty of pineapple flavor to the beer, pale malt, moderate sweetness creeps into the mouthfeel, but this is just about the hoppiest pale ale out there. Reminiscient of the Jupiter XPA and Bruery Humulus xpa, but this is has a little bit more alcohol and sweetness noticeable, less sessionable. 
Overall, a phenomenal display of what a pale ale can be like with the citra hop, a softer touch to it than the SN Torpedo citra or Kern river, much less in the malt department to let it stand out, it just has a more flowery and delicate aura to it here. Big points for keeping the bitterness down and the hop mouthfeel very high. 806 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Dec 25, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a nonic pint glass, an apricot golden orange hue with a bright chunky head just barely off white in color. Fine even lacing lines the sides of the glass as the head dwindles down. Aroma has a super citrus grapefruit nose, hints of crushed aspirin, tropical fruit with a underlying biscuit malt character. Flavor is crazy with Citra hops bringing out tropical fruit marmalade it's pretty awesome, nothing else like this creates the same flavor. Bitter citrus peel, pineapple notes, and a mellow biscuit malt sweetness matches the bitterness. I keep getting a really green peppermint tone in both the nose and the flavor, crazy but it works with the beers flavor. The palate is coated with hop oils ample carbonation rolls everything perfectly across with each sip. Overall a classic pale ale that could be most breweries, IPA really unleashes the perfect wave of Citra hops equating into a easy drinking pale ale that we all wish was more readily available. Thanks to the great trader, Ryan aka Schlais, out of Minnesota for this early Christmas gift. 1,062 charactersWVbeergeek, Dec 24, 2011

Pours golden orange with a nice head that leaves some serious lacing as the glass is emptied.
Smells of straight up tropical fruits. Gotta love those citra hops!
Taste follows the nose, very little malt presence here, mild bitterness that fades faster than the juicy tropical fruit hopyness.
Mouthfeel is just fine for an APA.
More like an IPA than an APA, this is right up there with Dreadnaught in my favorite FFF beers. 457 charactersbastu, Dec 23, 2011

T: More sweet, delicious citrus up front. Super smooth, creamy almost. Almost nothing past the aftertaste. 
M: Medium body, smooth and clean as mentioned. Cannot be understated, feels amazing in the mouth.
O: Hard to describe this one. It's not a super hoppy DIPA or a big roasty RIS. It's just right. It has to be the most drinkable beer I've had. Just smooth, clean with some nice citrus and enough malt backbone to balance it out. I thought Alpha King was the best APA I've ever had but I think FFF has broken their own highwater mark. 668 charactersDope, Dec 19, 2011

A: A lazy, hazy orange gold color. A finger and a half of bubbly cream colored head quickly settles to a spotty quarter finger. Nice, thick gobs of lacing. Head dissipates rapidly, a little disappointing.
S: The hops are apparent from a foot away. Pine, grapefruit, and orange zest. Just a citrus bomb. Fan-freakin-tastic.
T: Grapefruit, pine, candied orange, pineapple, a slightly resiny bittering finish that lingers nicely. A bit of creamy malt provides a nice backbone for the drying hops. Super juicy APA here. Flavors just explode but it's not sticky or cloying in the least. Wow is this good. 
M: Moderately carbonated, flavors are all there and very well-balanced. The finish is crisp and refreshing.
O: This would be a staple in my fridge were it readily available. Just an outstanding APA from start to finish. So packed with flavor at a relatively low 6.2%. The interplay between sweet citrus and bitter resin plays out very nicely. Just fantastic. 990 characterssiege06nd, Dec 18, 2011

Pours a nice cloudy orange. Nice solid one finger head or so. Tiny bubbles continue to rise to the surface, seems to being light to moderate carbonation. Nice lacing all around.
Aroma is how all hoppy beers should be. Great balance of hops and malt. A really vibrant citrus, grapefruit, and mango aroma is there at the front. While it stays there throughout, there is a touch of sweet caramel malt that creates the perfect balance. 
Absolutely delicious. Very similar to aroma, but slightly subdued. I remember the citrus really bursting through in the flavor on draft, but it seems held in check here. Still excellent. No lingering bitterness. Hop flavors come through first, followed by a complementary malt.
Spot on mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation, right between light and moderate. Medium body and absolutely drinkable. This stuff goes down very easy. 
Awesome beer. All I can really say is if you get the chance to try this you really should. It is probably the best pale ale out there. 1,115 charactersahq514, Dec 18, 2011

This beer has a wonderful hop aroma that continues into the overall taste. A very well made beer that has a citrusy, floral, and refreshing quality that suits a nice summer day.
The intensive hopping provides tremendous bitterness without overpowering the beautiful refreshing subtlety of this brew.
Overall, I prefer this to a SN Pale Ale as my favorite. The only drawback is it is not as widely available as the SN. I highly recommend seeking this out. 617 characterspmoore311, Dec 16, 2011

poured into a snifter
appearance: i got a huge white fluffy head with this pour, prolly 1-2". otherwise pours a dark translucent amber color
aroma: great nose on this beer. huge tones of pinneaple and pine, great hop forward scent!
palate: oh so smooth for a pale ale. i prefer pretty bitter brews, but man oh man can i appreciate how good this one feels in the mouth
taste: more smooth character, this one goes down easy. heavy on the pine flavors, and perfect on the citrus. the only thing keeping this from perfect is that i thought it could have had some more hop to it, but the thing is so darn smooth so its ok
overall: this one lived up to the hype. its nice to have a rare, top 50 beer that's reasonably priced too. very glad i got to try this, and thanks again to kalvarez for the trade! will be happily drinking this over the next 2 weeks!! 889 charactersmobius387, Dec 16, 2011

Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a huge fluffy white head that displays great retention and lacing. Smells of citrus, pine and resin mostly with hints of green onion and garlic. If there is malt in here I can't find it. Taste is citrus, pine, resin, and green onion with maybe some bits of bready malt if I squint a bit. Long lingering onion hop bite in the finish. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation with a sharp resinous mouthfeel. I'm glad I got the opportunity to try this brew, but to call this a pale ale is quite a stretch, we could safely call this an IPA. That being said, this is a great IPA. 697 charactersjohnnnniee, Dec 16, 2011

One finger high, slightly off-white, foamy head. Head sticks around for a bit, decent lacing too. The beer is slightly hazy with a burnt golden color.
The aroma is exploding with hoppy, fruity, and citrusy goodness. Plenty of sweet grapefruit, citrus, some mango or papaya, almost some light floral notes as well, and sweet light malt in the background.
Lots of juicy citrus and sweet grapefruit, other tropical fruits, piney notes, some lighter bitterness, caramel sweet malts and maybe a touch of bready malts. Great flavor profile, though not quite as strong as the aroma leads me to believe.
Consistency is smooth, carbonation is creamy, the body is light bordering on medium, and the finish is actually quite long and wet, leaving me with fruit, citrus and light bitterness. Really nice mouthfeel.
Overall this is one of the top APAs I've had. It walks the line between an APA and an IPA very well. And for as wonderfully hoppy as it smells and tastes, I don't know that it can be beat. Good reason why it's the number 1 rated APA at the moment. Had again recently and I had to up my score from 4.0 to 4.5. It's just that damn good. Though I think I prefer Alpha King just slightly to ZD, it's still wonderful. 1,286 charactersmatttttYCE, Dec 13, 2011

A-Pretty standard pour for a pale ale. Dark orange body with a creamy 1 finger head that hangs around for a while.

T-Bitter grape fruit with some pepper and orange peel almost. Quite the bite from the hops.
M-Pretty drinkable overall. A little too bitter to session but nonetheless a classy pale ale. Very creamy and carbonation is a little much for my taste. 
O-Zombie Dust is an awesome beer. Great art, good price and tastes nice. It is probably one of the best pale ales out there but I found the bitterness to be overly accentuated. 704 charactersbeerhan, Dec 13, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on 12/2. Reviewed from notes.
Very clean, with an amber, almost red, body. Head is a crisp white and lacing is brownish and temporary. This is a shade darker in color than your usual IPA and it implies additional flavor and maltiness.
Scent is piney, floral and sweet. The fresh earthiness is evident, as is the acidic orange and malty caramel.
Flavor profile opens with a nice creaminess and citrus sweetness, ending with a grassy, slightly savory taste, which is appealing, since it's well balanced with that subtle opening. Hop profile is big and I can feel the dry bitterness linger on my tongue in a pleasant and non-confrontational fashion. There's also a spicy smokiness left behind, which is rather nice.
As for the mouth, it's a slow incline from soft and sweet to resiny and bitter and the progressive allows both sides of this coin to resonate.
An extraordinarily impressive effort from Three Floyds. I like it much better than Dreadnaught and it's really amazing to find a brew team that can manage to perfectly combine two different flavor profiles into one beer.
Is this really a pale ale? Well... I'm blown away. I initially reviewed this assuming that it was an IPA and the hop profile certainly reflects that. This is by far the hoppiest pale ale I've ever had and I'm sure it would be bombastic on tap. A must try. 1,346 charactersdeapokid, Dec 12, 2011

A- Pours murky brown in color. White fizzy head, doesn't stick around very long at all. What is left of the head clings to the edges of the glass.
S- Very hoppy aroma. Citrus and grapefruit jump out the most from it. Some pine, grassy hints mixed in. Fades at the end, but still the big aromas up front make up for it.
T- Tastes and drinks like it wants to be a dipa. Lots of hop flavors come through. Citrus, lemon, grapefruit hit first. Piney flavors there too. Doughy malts towards the end sweeten it a bit, but still lots of hop bitterness to it. Great mix of flavors. 
M- Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Juicy, oily feel to it.
O- Very good beer to drink. I wish I could pick up a six pack of this anytime. The one bottle left me wanting more. Hope they start making more and distribute it. Thanks Evan for the beer! 939 charactersHosP, Dec 11, 2011

A: Poured a very murky, carrot orange color, with about a finger and a half sticky, icky, mildly off-white head that stuck around throughout the session.
S: Citra hop bomb, with FFF signature profile (I always describe it as pomegranate -esque). More orange than grapefruit, and with mild candy malt bill.
T: Imagine a west coast IPA such as Kern River Just Outstanding with FFF man-candy bill on it. Ta - Dah!... and Zombie Dust is born. Lots of orange husk, Citra hops, and a nice fruit component that lingers (much more than the hop bitterness).
M: There was a bit of splotchy lacing but not too much. I'm in awe of how the fruit lingers without being syrupy; the hops sting without being too bitter. 
O: I really would like to try this one on tap or from a growler. Perhaps when I visit Chicago in a few days I'll get my chance. Nearly flawless! 944 charactersChaney, Dec 10, 2011

4.53/5  rDev 0%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A 12 ounce bottle from inlimbo77; thank you very much Bill! Poured into a Deschutes tulip glass.
Pours much darker than anticipated for a pale ale, being a burnt orange, copper color with darker brown/gold hues. About an inch of fluffy, bubbly white head develops, but dissipates slightly faster than anticipated; minimal lacing, but nice legs in the surface of the liquid. 
It smells of heaven, if heaven were laden with hops (which I believe it is). Pine, earth, grapefruit, lemon, orange, touches of coriander and spice, straw, various golden grains, and a bouquet of floral aromas all great the nose in the most appealing thing I've encountered in some time. I wish everything I owned smelled like this; I wish I smelled like this. 
The taste does not dissapoint. A brief introduction to citrus precedes a near immediate blast of bittering hops, bringing forth the pine, earthen, and floral notes subsequently. Aftert the hops, the citrus reappears in front of the aforementioned grains. Notable traces of the spice from the hops are detectable throughout. 
Mouthfeel is spot on; crisp and light on the tongue, a refreshing, invigorating swallow, and clean finish. 
Overall, this is much more hopped than I would expect an APA to be (I think this is more aptly labled an IPA). Regardless of how it's labeled, however, this is a damn fine beer that deserves recognition. Make any and all efforts to acquire this one if you enjoy hops. 1,442 characterseclipse54, Dec 08, 2011

From a bottle into a snifter. 
APPEARANCE: Pours a fizzy, thin, loose off-white head with horrible retention. Very loose and fizzy head. Pathetic. Fizzes down to a bubbly ring and half wisp. Slightly hazy tenne orange with no carbonation evident. A bubbly ring remains but leaves no real lacing down the glass. Color is nice, but the head is embarrassing. 
SMELL: Very nice nose for sure. Pale malts, honeydew melon, lots of nice citrus and a touch of soapy notes. Lemon, light orange and grapefruit for sure. Bold and fruity, and the soapy notes don’t get in the way. 
TASTE: Pale malts, honeydew melon and lots of citrus again. Lemon and grapefruit through the middle and lots of bitterness on the finish. Bold and lingering aftertaste with lots of citrus, touches of soap, and a good dose of hop bitterness. Though a little empty at the beginning, the flavors really come out at the swallow and the soapy notes never detract from the experience.
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Light on the palate, but still creamy enough, goes down smooth and finishes slightly dry on the palate. A little too light, even for the style, but otherwise pretty solid. 
OVERALL: Despite the pathetic excuse for a head, this is a pretty solid brew. Definitely not a huge fan of citra hops, but the malt base was strong enough to keep the soapy notes that citra hops are so well known for in check. Obviously not worth all the exaggerated press it gets on here, but one to check out if you get the chance. Would drink again. Definitely worth the 3F Zomer I traded for it. Thanks again Claaark13! 1,770 charactersJeffo, Dec 07, 2011

A - Pours a hazy orange-gold with a fluffy white head that settles to a 1/2 inch cap, leaving lots of soapy lacing clinging to the glass. Quite nice.
S - Insanely pungent, Citra-forward aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, and mango with a very slight toasted malt profile. I love this, gimme more CITRA!
T - Pretty close to the nose, not as intensely flavored as the nose would suggest but still delicious. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange, and mango with just the right amount of bitterness in the finish. This walks the line between APA and IPA so closely, perfectly combining the drinkability of the former with the hop explosion of the latter.
M - Smooth and slightly creamy, with a medium body and excellent carbonation. I only wish this was a touch lower in the ABV department so I could drink it all day!
O - Hands down the best Pale Ales I've ever had, I could go through cases of this stuff. Amazing! 976 charactersjsanford, Dec 07, 2011

S- monstrous pungent hop aromas scream from the glass with resin, juicy citrus and an over the top aromatic leafy eucalyptus characteristic. The slightest hint of biscuity malt barely comes put on the finish.
T- again hop nirvana arrives. Juicy citrus tones blend with notes of mango and tropical fruit. Floral touches in the middle with hop resin comes out in the middle. Finishes very dry with a solid hop bitterness and the slightest touch of pale malt.
MF- slick juicy mouthfeel with a medium body and soft fine carbonation.
D- drinks like aqua! 
Overall a world class pale ale that brings any hop lover to tears! Amazing. 752 charactersViciousknishs, Dec 07, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.512oz bottle into a wide flute
A: Pours a light orange color with three fingers of dense white head. Beautiful lacing and wonderful retention. A bit darker than what I'm used to for the style, but i won't fault it there.
S: Lots and lots of fresh citrus smells. Almost like smelling fresh lemon and orange peel. I get a bit of floral hops in the background, but this one is a dry smelling citrus bomb. Simply amazing.
T: Fairly significant bitterness starts off with faint floral and citrus hop flavor. Slight sweetness and bready malt flavors work in with the hops. While this flavor is by no means bad or even average, it is a huge disappointment from the aroma. Having subsequent bottles I find the taste a bit more intense.
M: Light, good carb - great for a APA.
O: Interesting. The aroma is very enticing but the citrus hop flavor just isn't strong enough for me. The bitterness is there, but I was hoping to taste those delicious citrus hop aromas I smelled. This is a solid APA for sure, but it's not world class IMO. 1,028 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Dec 07, 2011

The second I popped the cap on this beer, my nostrils got hit with a huge whiff of hops. Pours a slightly-hazy, golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very heavy with the Citra hops. Lovely citra aroma with a bit of pine and somewhat earthy notes. Taste just has so much hoppy goodness going on, it's ridiculous. I haven't had Alpha King in a long time, but I remember thinking the same thing: "How do they get such intense hop profile into a pale ale?" Great citra hop flavors with lovely citrus fruit and just the slightest hint of malt. Not sure if this is a fresh hop ale, but it sure tastes like one. An all-citra fresh hop ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat resiny, with a crisp finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic pale ale. I would love to do a side by side with Alpha King and Daisy Cutter to see who gets crowned supreme pale ale. 952 charactersDovaliHops, Dec 04, 2011

The smell here is simply phenomenal! It is like walking into a flower shop, the hops here sing. Very fresh citrus scent with a bit of freshly cut grass mixed in there. Among the best smelling beers I can say I've ever encountered.
Taste on this is excellent as well, on the slight downside is that it comes extremely close to but doesn't quite match the impact of the smell however you still capture all of the hoppy goodness in it.
A beer you can drink all day long that is packed with wonderful flavor.

4.37/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Dan3279 for yet another amazing trade.
Poured from a 12 oz. capped bottle (No Date) into a pint glass.
A moderate pour yields a 1-finger cream-colored head that slowly settles to a thick dusting. The body is a hazy honey amber with a strong amount of energetic carbonation bubbles. Sheets of lacing cling to the edges of the glass throughout consumption.
The nose is so vibrant and complex, it may be simpler to list what is not noticed. Grapefruit, mango, orange rinds, pineapple, lemon, grass, and flowers are all easily discernible aromas. I'm sure there are more lying deep within but I can't just sit here smelling this beer all day.
Sweet honey and mild citrus fruit flavors start each sip with notes of mandarin oranges and grapefruit and a slight grassiness in the background. As the beer is swallowed, huge flavors of grass, flowers, and pine come out. A dry pine bitter aftertaste ends each sip.
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is has a great mouthfeel for an American Pale Ale. The body is refreshing and easy-drinking without being sticky or coating. The carbonation is only barely noticeable and is probably doing more in the background than I can give it credit for. 1,219 charactersoutput01x, Dec 02, 2011

Pours clear bubbly amber with a small creamy beige head that recedes to a thin collar. not much lacing.
Whoa, this thing packs a serious punch in the nose with grapefruit, pine resin, lemongrass, pineapple. Some light biscuity malts as well. Without a doubt, the best nose I've come across in a pale ale.
Taste doesn't quite match the standard set by the nose but it's still great. The initial taste is juicy citrus with grapefruit and floral pine and grass - really showcases the Citra hops. There is a light bready malt in the background but the taste is all about the hops which leave a tangy bitterness in the finish.
The mouthfeel is light, well carbonated and really crisp and clean.
This is probably the best APA I've tasted. The Citra hops are certainly the dominant player and it works really well. Excellent beer. 863 charactersgford217, Dec 02, 2011

A: The beer has a very pretty orange color, thats mostly clear (you can see through it more or less). Leaves some nice lacing and has only a ring of head once it settles. Solid look.
S: This is special. Some super amazing smells all packed into a tight, aromatic package. the citra hops appeal to me with the citrus and grassy aromas that play well with the dry biscuity malt that is not sweet at all, makes for a beautifully hoppy platform and smell that is just about dead on for what I enjoy in APA's/easy hoppy IPAs. 
T: Taste follows suit, it's super juicy and amazingly hoppy, the sweetness and bitters and dryness are all just about just right. I also get some tropical fruits and some candy like tastes as well, this is quite complex and tasty. It's hard to believe how awesomely integrated the hops and malts are in this, it all just makes sense and drinks shockingly well.
M: Nice feel, great carbonation, easy over the palate and just overall slides right down the hatch. Right on FFF&gt;
Overall, this and Dreadnaught and Bourbon/Vanilla Bean Dark lord could be the only 3 beers I take to a desert island and I'd be just fine. I just love FFF, I may be biased as they got me into craft beer, but they just know how to make beer. Right on. 1,421 charactersDreadnaught33, Dec 01, 2011

A-- Poured a hazy orange mustard color. Good looking bright white head, two finger height. Good staying power to the head. Lots of spotty lacing as drank through this and great head retention. 
S-- Just the nose of this was unreal. One of the best noses I have come across. Very IPA like nose. Candied pineapple, passion fruit, candied lemon and lime. Lots of fruit and a very good malt backbone. 
T-- Excellent taste. Lots of grass, pineapple, pine, passion fruit and lemon and lime. Far more complex than other APA's around.

O-- I consider myself lucky to have some good APA's in this part of the world with LC and Stone and Wood Pacific Ale, but this beer blows the heck out of anything I have had in a long time.

Overall: An excellent example of an aromatous pale ale which stays true to the pale ale genre in the taste. 523 characterskylehay2004, Nov 29, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - pours with two fingers of white foam on top of a clear, golden body. The head settles at a moderate pace and leaves nice lace.
S - pungent, fruity hops with notes of mango and pineapple. Toffee and sweet, bready malt in the background.
T - lightly sweet, bready malt up front with pine hops. Some more soft malt in the middle and a hint of the fruity character of the aroma. Finishes with subtle malt, fresh hops, and moderate bitterness.
M - medium body, moderate carbonation, and a somewhat dry finish.
D - very nice, it has the aroma of a full blown ipa, but the flavor profile is subtle and balanced as a pale ale should be. 636 charactersnickfl, Nov 29, 2011

Poured a hazy golden orange colour with a nice white head that retained well and dripped with lacing as it went down.
Smell was incredible. Candied grapefruit, candied citrus, candied passionfruit. All working in wonderfully well together. I was smelling this for minutes before even considering taking a sip.
Taste backed it up, as the grapefruit, citrus and passionfruit all melded in well together in a beautifully refreshing beer.
Delicious body, not too highly carbonated and a bitterness level that suited the style perfectly making it highly drinkable but with enough bitterness to keep you well entertained. ABV was super well hidden!
Hands down the best beer i have had this year. Amazing! First beer of the tasting and we were proclaiming this as beer of the night and beer of the year all in one. 920 charactersMrKennedy, Nov 28, 2011

Smell: Very piney, floral-citrus hop bitterness. Grapefruits and lemons. Very fresh aroma, like a spring day. A little honey sweetness in the nose as well. Smells like an excellent single IPA. 5/5
Taste: Aggressive citrus hops bitterness. The main flavor that comes to mind is grapefruit. A little lemony as well. Some earthy pine and floral flavors. An underlying honey sweetness. A little tart and malty-sweet on the midpalate, but a very dry, bitter finish. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium-high carbonation. The carbonation really makes the bitterness of the beer pop on the tongue. 5/5
Hard as it is to believe that there might be a better pale ale than Alpha King on the market, let alone one from the same brewery, Zombie Dust delivers against all the hype. 955 charactersjegross2, Nov 28, 2011

4.17/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On-tap at Bavarian Lodge on November 26th, 2011. Served in a pint glass. Been anticipating coming across this one for months. 
A - Attempting to overcome the Lodge here - the restaurant is dark as hell. Looks very much like a pilsner, with a transparent light yellow coloring and a nice two-finger eggshell white head. Okay retention and awesome lacing around the edges of the pint glass.
S - This is more west coast than any other IPA/DIPA offering I've had from FFF. Pine tree on top of mandarin orange-sweetness. Slightly nutty. Grapefruit seeds underneath. Very light malts.
T - Unadulterated (and awesome) Citra hop resin and oil. Honey-roasted peanuts. More pine and quite a bit more grapefruit than was present in the nose. 
M - Excellent. Light-medium body, good carbonation for the style, and a really nice dry finish that leads into a lingering Citra hop, bitter aftertaste. 
D - Best APA/IPA I've come across. Easily beats Daisy Cutter in aroma and the hop quality is better in the drink. Makes Alpha King seem pretty average. Can't wait to grab a six-pack.
Update - Returning to Zombie Land once more, finally was able to by a sixer straight from the brewpub. I love this beer, feel is perfect out of the 12 oz. bottle and the taste seems to have more complexity. Probably the most crush-worthy beer I've had since joining BA.
Update 2 - I'm not sure if this was me or FFF, but over the past year or so I've not really been happy with ZD. And I've had it a lot. The taste really went downhill, so I need to dock this a few points for inconsistency. 1,567 charactersAuracom, Nov 27, 2011

A: Pours a lovely bright gold with just a hint of yeast haze. A thick and bubbly two finger layer of foam popped up on top before settling down to a thick collar that left a ton of lacey patterns behind.
S: Glorious, tropical Citra hops. Mango, pineapple, tangerine, and apricot with a bit of pine for good measure. Malt is pretty subdued but I was able to pull out a bit of marshmallow when it came up to temp.
T: See above. More pine in the taste than the smell. 
M: Not terribly thick but coating. This thing plasters its' spicy hop oils everywhere in my mouth. Lovely peppery hop spiciness.
O: An absolutely wonderful beer. Heather and I were lucky enough to have tried this back in the Cenotaph days and have had it as Zombie Dust on draft and out of the bottle.

Pours a crisp golden orange with 2 fingers of frothy bright white head. Solid retention and sticky lacing.
Pungent, oily, citrusy hops. DANK!
Taste follows the nose.. sticky icky hops, juicy citrus. Clean and crisp.
Medium bodied, with a solid amount of carbonation. Drying hop aftertaste and some serious hop dragon breath.
Overall, I wanted this beer to not be good with all of the hype. This beer is like the Yankees or the Lakers. You want to hate them but all they do is win... Just like zombie dust. Amazing, simply amazing. 600 charactersdcloeren, Nov 26, 2011

12oz bottle at fridge temp poured into a snifter.
pours out a deep golden orange color, a slight haze, with about a 1 finger of white head, faded to a nice kind of thin retentive layer with some lace that sticks around. 
holy aroma! wonderful citra hops! raw and dank, resinous, super juicy orange citrus, and juicy tropical fruits. it seems to change each time i smell it. bits of a grainy/ yeasty character are sometimes noticed as well as a dank, oniony, vegetal character.
again, full of big, dank, juicy citrus and tropical fruit. all kinds of fruit, oranges, mangos, pineapples, papaya, its like im biting into a piece of juicy, ripe fruit, then a nice kick of bitterness. not much balance to this, just a bit of grains maybe noticable. slightly vegetal at times, but it works well with this beer.
flows over the palate super smoothly, medium to light bodied. hopped to an ipa level, but has the body and feel of a pale ale. 
an awesome beer, all around. citra hop, my new personal favorite thanks to this beer. it just seems to have every kind of hop flavor. "juicy" being the key word i like to use to describe this hop. definatly super sessionable, any hop head could easily down 6 packs of this. 1,321 charactersdogfishandi, Nov 24, 2011

Had a fun argument with thearkhammonk about the everyday drinking beer you want for the rest of your life. He said Zombie and I said Boulevard Tank 7. After trying the first time and truly analyzing it, he may (i said may) have a point.
Pours a dark gold color with white as snow foamy head. It has a wonderful hoppy nose with some citrus. Mouthfeel is not overly remarkable, being the APA that it is. Taste is just a party in your mouth with citrus, hops, sweet and some kind of NW woods kinda thing. Finish lingers with sweet, which would make this a perfect beer to pair with anything from BBQ to fish. Super great APA, this coming from a kid who grew up in STL and cut his teeth on AB beers....(arent they all the exact same with some food coloring???) 906 charactersgbbass16, Nov 24, 2011

M - full body with medium carbonation

Huge thanks to BA cadaugherty for sending this as an extra in a recent trade; I've been on such a Citra hop kick recently that I was considering trying to trade for this beer anyway.
---
Appearance: Free pour yields a one and a half inch fluffy white head that dissipates slowly leaving thick lacing. Pours a very hazy orange-y yellow (marigold) and leaves some streaks and spots of lacing.
Smell: Before putting my face to the glass I can smell the hops. Tropical fruit, some mild onion, pine. With time, tangerine-like citrus becomes a dominant aspect of the consistently strong aroma. 
There's not much to write, but there's lots going on. This is everything I associate with Citra hops, potent, complex, inviting, and it doesn't let up. Maybe some malt background could help, but I love what's here.
Taste: Very similar to the nose: smooth, juicy tropical fruit up front, then some malt character and onion, with a really citrusy (orange and tangerine) finish. Note on the "onion," of course it's not onion, it's hops; it's the oniony, vegetal flavor that comes along with Citra hops, and with everything else going on, it is not jarring in the slightest. 
The malt backbone here is characterless, which could be called a flaw, but works really well to highlight the hop flavor. Mild bitterness. Wonderfully attenuated; no unpleasant sugary sweetness, just refreshing, pungent hop flavors. Passion fruit and tangerine are dominant. Mango, orange, pine... this hop has a lot of depth, and the beer is brewed perfectly to showcase that. 
Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied. Great bitterness and carbonation levels, the former just enough so you notice it, the latter moderate enough that you don't. Semi-dry finish.
Overall: Competitive for the best American Pale Ale I've had, and at the moment I like APAs better than (D)IPAs. This is a single hop beer that justifies the simplicity of its recipe by proving the full depth of Citra hops. Great stuff. 
As a hop vessel, this beer is all 5s. I'd love a nice, flavorful malt backbone (as exemplified in fresh NEBCO Gold Stock Ale) to push it over the top, but as is I'm pretty in love with this beer. 2,336 charactersPahn, Nov 22, 2011

Pours a beautiful shade of very light orange. Strikingly translucent clarity. A one-finger white head just won't quit, and lasts throughout my experience enjoying this beer. 
The aroma is phenomenal. The brightest, most vibrant citrus I've ever gotten out of an APA. It almost smells like a freshly-cut lime, the citrus is that alive. Sticky, resiny pine notes, like being in a forest. I get a little touch of biscuit in the back end. It's nuts. 
Oh Three Floyds, how endearing I find your over-the-top, abrasive hoppiness. The hop presence in this beer is absolutely huge, it totally coats the palate. In the middle, I get a little hint of graham crackers for some nice counterbalancing sweetness. But really, this is all about those beautifully piney, resiny hops. This is ultra-floral, and so smooth. 
Carbonation is a little low for my liking, but not too far off the mark. To call this drinkable would be a tremendous understatement.
I drank this bottle while watching one of the penultimate episodes of the most recent season of Breaking Bad. Suffice it to say, Zombie Dust is becoming my Blue Sky. I want to drink this on tap and from growlers. I'm not sure I could ask for more, taste-wise, from an APA. 1,341 charactersamphion1065, Nov 21, 2011

N: Citrus hop bomb up front, tangerines, hop oil, resin, some toasted bread with a slight honey-ish twang.
T/M: Clean spritzy, citrus hops, dominant tangy hop flavors, lemon peel, almost wheat like and refreshing but with a great hop resin that strongly sticks on the palate. The hops eventually give way to more of that great toasted honey-ish character that I find in a lot of FFF beers; subtle notes of fresh pears, pineapple and tangerine.
D: Would make a great lawnmower beer if you're in the mood for a little assertive hop character to go along with that refreshing, spritzy quality. 651 charactersbiga7346, Nov 20, 2011

A: SRM is harvest yellow. Head is off white, 1/2 in with normal pour, dissipates to line the rim of the glass. Medium/heavy carbonation. Light lacing.
S: Hops come right off the top, emparting grapefruit/citrus notes. 
T: Hops hit perimeter of pallet initially, but much more subdued than the smell suggests. Light malt notes are present on the middle of the palate and creates a balanced overall taste. Aftertaste is slightly bitter hops, but just in the back of the palate.
M: Hop/malt balance along with carbonation and medium/light body give a mf that is very easy and agreeable while still challenging the palate.
O: Very good beer. I did not think that 3F possessed the restraint to so delicately craft a beer like this. Truely an APA, but this is not suggested by the nose. Big hops, but when you drink this beer is balanced and mellow, yet still hoppy. Well done. 916 characterstsauce2, Nov 19, 2011

I feel like most are not worthy of this beer. Poured into New Belgium snifter with a quarter-inch of white foam head and decent lacing. Color is a ruby-amber.
Smell is immediate citrus with grapefruit, lemon, and most importantly pine. So much pine. As weird as this sounds, i smell a tad bit of dark roast, bitter coffee.
Taste is all kinds of floral and citrus hops. Pine, earth, lemon, orange, caramel, and that bitter coffee i was talking about.
Mouthfeel makes you happy that you didn't know what kind of expectations to have for this beer. Carbonation is perfect for a floral pale. Aftertaste is unlike anything ive ever tasted.
Can't wait for this beer to gravitate to the central part of our state. Three floyds has a magical hop garden that is unmatched. 850 characterszep9865, Nov 19, 2011

4.75/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - In between Alpha King and Lagunitas Sucks in terms of color. no cloudiness like Alpha King. Lacing disappears surprisingly fast.
S - More citrus and less sweet than Lagunitas Sucks. So good. Smell is awesome. Minimal hops. Smells makes me want to drink it so badly.
T - I was thinking this as I finished smelling this beer: IT is not complex. It tastes somewhat one-dimensional. However, that one dimension is really quite near perfect. Maybe this is why people love it so much. Aftertaste has some bite, but it's pleasant... lingering but pleasant. Mouthfeel is great. Love the bitterness.
O - Really nice. This is my gfs favorite beer which maybe makes me love it too. It really is great.
EDIT: Had this alone tonight. Bottle was maybe 90 days old. I. loved. it. Definitely a 5 for taste. Changed my review to reflect my new feelings. 844 charactersdlello2, Nov 19, 2011

Aroma was hops, citrus and biscuit. Very nice. 
Taste was bitter hops, biscuit, grain and grapefruit. 
Dry finish. Really full and enjoyable beer. I could drink quite a few of these. 353 charactersdrumrboy22, Nov 18, 2011

4.82/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I first had this beer when it was called Cenotaph. I thought the beer was pretty good but when I had it again at the Three Floyds Anniversary Party I was pretty much blown away. Hands down the best American Pale ale I have ever had. You could say I was pretty bummed when I went to pick up my beers and this was sold out. Glad I got to try it on draft and hopefully will have some here in AZ soon. 
Appearance: Served in my plastic cup this had a nice golden yellow color to it and a slight haze to it from what I could tell. Great color! Nice white capped head that stuck around right to the finish. 
Smell: As soon as I took a whiff of this I was in heaven. Didn't expect to be treated with such a tremendous smell. All kinds of citrus going on. I detected mostly orange and mango followed by some pineapple and a little peach and grapefruit. Has a nice biscuit note on the end.
Taste: Aside from the wonderful smell the taste followed the nose completely. Lots of Citurs --mainly orange and mango. So easy to drink. Has a great cracker/biscuit quality on the after taste which I love in my IPA's and Pale Ales. Hardly any bitterness to this one at least compared a beer I drink regularly --Stone IPA. I think the recipe was definitely changed since Cenotaph because I do not recall loving this beer nearly as much. This beer brings it all-- smell and easy drinking, tastiness.
Mouthfeel: Has the perfect amount of carbonation. Had just the right amount of carbonation to deliver an awesome tasting experience. They nailed this one pretty much perfect. 
Overall: I cannot say enough about what a great beer this is. I look forward to try it in the bottle. I can pretty confidently say that not only is this the best pale ale I have had but probably my new favorite beer in the ipa/pale ale category that Three Floyds produces. I used to think Daisy Cutter was the best pale ale out there but this one beats it and beats it solidly. It helps that my favorite hop being Citra is used in this one. I couldn't get enough of this beer when i was at the party and look forward to getting as much as people will trade me. If anyone reads this and wants to do a trade hit me up and I will definitely make it worth your while. 2,224 charactersRampage1, Nov 17, 2011

4.12/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a Stone Imperial glass. Bright golden orange color. A bit on the unfiltered side. Large carbonation bubbles lead to a small, one finger, barely off white, cream colored head. Lace is kind of minimal right now and stays that way to the end.
Smell is fantastic! Huge citrus and pineapple smells. There is some pink grapefruit and tangerine. The hops really take a shotgun seat. Pine resin and leafy hop cones really make this a complete and wonderful nose.
Taste is similar to the nose but different. The really citrus flavors aren't at all as prominent and almost turn from a hop bitter to a malt bitter. There is a real earthy/grassy flavor that isn't detectable in the nose. I also get some malted sour apple candy taste. 
Mouth is crisp and creamy. With a medium body and an average to long, wet finish.
Overall I really enjoyed this, but am over it. I have heard such great things about this APA, that maybe it coming from FFF I was expecting an IPA profile like Alpha King. Maybe I'm being way too hard on FFF, because I expected that. Rambling I may be, the point is. This is a fantastic beer. If you hold FFF to an ultra high standard, like I do, then you will be a bit disappointed. With this being said I am happy. Thanks to TIMMYJ21 for this extra. 1,273 charactersazdback, Nov 17, 2011

Freshness: Not indicated
Packaging: 12 oz. brown bottle
Glassware: Globe glass
Purchased: Received in the US South LIF
Color is a hazy dark yellow/orange. The head is off-white and frothy, of maybe 2 fingers in height. Retention is good and lacing is very good.
Aromas are of hops, hops and more hops, featuring floral, grassy, citrus and tropical fruit characteristics. 
Taste is crisp, clean and very bitter, with little malt presence. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky in the body and highly carbonated. Aftertastes are of hoppy, citrus bitterness.
As a vehicle for highlighting the Citra hop, this beer delivers well. Not a style I'm crazy about, but execution is excellent.
Thanks to Janderson91 for this one! 736 characterssommersb, Nov 17, 2011

4/5  rDev -11.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a clear deep golden orange with a light tan head and some large bubbles sitting on top. The nose has a light grain profile, a touch of doughy malt, citric bite and notes of mango. The flavor follows the same path but a bit fruitier and more integrated. The grain and dough malt balance pretty nicely on the assertive fruity hop flavors of citrus and other tropical fruits. The bitterness is assertive but not overpowering on medium body with a clean semi dry finish. Another solid hoppy offering from FFF, if only they could get sugars eaten in their stouts. 564 characterscpetrone84, Nov 16, 2011

Pouring into an Old Rasputin nonic pint glass. Hazy, medium golden with a slightly rocky off-white head that's holding firm and leaving lacing behind. 
Big, juicy nectarine and peach fruit in the nose. Dried mango. Hops are first and foremost but a very subtle toasted malt lies in wait for a patient nose. 
Large and in charge fruitiness, loaded up with hop flavor. Like biting into a yellow peach, perhaps a nectarine, very inviting. Mostly clean malt is in a strong, dual supporting role keeping order and making sure you come back for more. Dry finish with a lingering fruity hop. 
Medium-light in body, moderate carbonation. 
Overall this is one hell of an American Pale Ale. Aggressively hopped with a wonderful fruity hop character, super-drinkable. 958 charactersBrewerB, Nov 16, 2011

A - Pours golden orange with 2 finger creamy/frothy head. Bit of hop haze - gorgeous.
S - Where this beer shines. All fruit - peach, mango, orange, grapefruit, pineapple. Incredible. Minimal malt background.
T - Doesn't quite fulfill where the nose leads. Fruitiness up front, bitterness and resin in the back. Really great pale ale but isn't nearly as fruity as the aroma.
M - Creamy, moderate bitterness, dry finish. Perfect for the style.
O - Wish I had more of this beer. Probably the best pale ale I've ever had, just wish the nose didn't lead me on as much. If I could have it daily I would. 660 charactersbballmj2k, Nov 15, 2011

The smell is fresh, juicy, tropical fruit; mango, tangerine, and orange. 
The taste is also juicy citrus hops. There's a little support from some bready malt but make no mistake, this is all about the hops. 
Mouthfeel is medium light with good carbonation. Slightly dry on the palate. 
This is a terrific pale ale, one of the best around. 432 charactersVonerichs, Nov 15, 2011

T: Kind of bitter with a citrus profile. Very pleasant aroma. At 6.4% its teetering on the edge of IPA, but whatever, just a classification anyway. Very well rounded with bitterness, aroma, hops, and caramel flavors.
M: Highly carbonated and stings the tongue with a medium body for an APA. Absolutely love it.
O: Overall this is a solid APA, strong and well flavored. After all the commotion this beer has caused in the forums for the past year or so Its definitely good, and I drink it all the time probably because of convenience but still it is one of my favorites. 748 charactersGBallHead, Nov 14, 2011

4.12/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412oz bottle received in a recent trade with immobilisme poured into a Bruery tulip.
A - Pours a near perfectly clear pale amber gold color with a cap of fluffy white foam that stands a solid finger high with good staying power. Head falls slowly and leaves a thick sheet of lacing on the glass.
S - Smell is dominated nearly completely by thick citrusy grapefruit - strongly reminiscient of that first whiff of fresh fruit as the fruit is peeled. Mild hint of pineapple, light earth, sugar. Very hop forward APA.
T - Sweaty and grapefruity, some peach and pineapple. Fairly bitter overall, especially for an APA. This really has a majority of its character fitting into the IPA category. Dirty, dank, full of hops - citrus mostly with some earthy hops underneath.
M - Pretty heavy feeling, full bodied, syrupy, sweaty bitterness, green hoppiness...tastes fresh. Carbonation is high and quite prickly on the tongue.
O - This is quite good overall. I think it is a bit heavy overall and (can't believe I'm saying this) maybe a bit over-saturated on the hop flavors - probably just a particular aspect which I associate with armpits. Glad to try this one - don't think it's really an APA...it's a good IPA for me, worth seeking out, but definitely not my favorite either. 1,273 charactersportia99, Nov 10, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5-pours a very opaque amber color with a tall white head. there is some great lacing and retention involved as well
-very citrus forward hop nose character. i am getting tangerine, orange and some pineapple. there is also sting type sensation in the back of the nose
-there is a real flavor blast right up front and then it really mellows through the middle and end. the initial blast is tangerine and cuties. right after that there is a bit of a bitter rind type taste which will linger through the finish. it is a real quick flip of flavors that seems weird on the palate, but not necessarily in a bad way
-i posted a bit on the feel in flavor with the flavor flip mouth sensation. there also seems to be some very tight carb bubbles here. there is a bit of oily feel towards the back of the mouth
-this is very good. i would even call it great in the sense that it seems like it is going to be one of those IPA's with the mislabeled PA on it based on the smell, but the flavor isn't too hop forward, just really nice and balanced 1,035 charactersjuhl31, Nov 09, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Gravity pour out of a fresh cask at Fountainhead in a pint glass.
Appearance: A beautiful cask pour; a lightly hazy, mostly clear golden tangerine color with a rocky off-white rocky froth casually resting on top, an obvious reminder of the serving type. 
Smell: The aroma is a little bit muted compared to the bottle or tap versions, but it is still full of hoppy goodness. The pale malts give a soft sweet and bready back, with aromatic mango, pineapple, and grapefruit hops shining through.
Taste: Somehow, the flavor is even better than the regular tap version. Softly sweet bread and light grains cannot contain a sweet, juicy hop explosion that builds, peaks, and finishes without a single wasted IBU. The mango, pineapple, and papaya flavors work well with the sweetness, with a flash of tart and bitter grapefruit kick near the end. The most amazing thing is just how smooth this flavor is.
Mouthfeel: The carbonation is obviously on the very light side, there is just enough to excite the taste buds. A hop bitterness leaves a bit of hop residue behind my lips, and the overall sensation is creamy and smooth.
Overall: As a hophead, I love any version of this beer. It is even better on cask, and I am slowly realizing I might be a cask IPA fanatic. 1,262 charactersKickInTheChalice, Nov 08, 2011

Appearance: Pours a nice golden with a 2 finger white (slightly buttery) crown that displays good retention and lace.
Smell: Nice citrus with a hint of melon citra profile. Very little malt profile other than minor bready notes. West Coast all the way.
Taste: Same as nose.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with good carbonation.
Overall: Sessionable great tasting hoppy brew. 427 characterskoopa, Nov 08, 2011
4.13/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Got a sixer at the binnys accross the street from GI brewpub. Had it on tap ~6 mos ago, but I suspect the keg was not quite as fresh as it should have been. This is much more lively than I remember. 
Bright golden color with a nice white head with good lacing and good duration. Aroma is very citrus hop forward kind of juicy. Grapefruit, clementine, tangerine. Very nice. Flavor is clean nice citrus hops with similar citrus notes as the aroma. Mouthfeel is ok. Could be a touch drier, and there is not enough carbonation for me. Overall its a damn good beer. Great offering by FFF. 584 charactersAgold, Nov 08, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Shout out to mtunnel and zimmerbloke for sending some of these my way. Thanks Matt's. Poured into a pair of New Belgium globes and shared with tulipsnifter. 
A: Nice orange-caramel color in the glass with a fluffy three finger off-white head. Ridiculous sheets of lacing. 5/5
S: I don't have the strongest sense of smell, but I was met with a great orange zest aroma the moment the crown went "pfft". Upon closer examination I get more great citrus aromas and even a little pineapple. I don't typically get tropical hop character from citra so I'm wondering if there are some other hops in here as well. Make no doubt about it, the hops are on full display here and balance has gone out the window... Not that it's a bad thing. 5/5
T: I was promised citrus in the nose and wow, did I get it in the taste as well. Clean navel sweetness with a long bitter finish works just fine for my liking. Some pinesap helps wrap this thing ip nicely. Let it warm up, and you'll get some light biscuit. Some more balance with more of a malt backbone would bring this more to style, but the beer is really damn good regardless. 5/5
M: Full and creamy with a crisp finish. They simply don't get any better than this. 5/5
O: One of the best beers I've ever had regardless of style. I'm unsure if I've been so taken aback by any beers quite this much lately. Worth the accolades it gets, and then some. If this was available near me, I'd have a case tomorrow. 5/5 1,450 charactershopsbreath, Nov 06, 2011

4.54/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle into my Ithaca glass. It poured a hazy, pale amber color with a frothy, white, half-inch head to it. Good head retention and lacing as I drank it. 
The aroma is amazing. It has some huge, fresh, tropical fruit flavors that really jump out at you. Notes of pineapple, peach, mango and orange all come out and mix wonderfully. I'm a Citra lover, and this beer is pretty much as good as it gets for me personally on aroma. 
The taste starts out showing more of a bitter, citrus rind, grapefruit like profile to it. As you progress more of the juicy, bright notes of pineapple, peach and mango all start coming out. The finish leaves some sweeter, juicy flavors lingering. 
The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it's a fantastic beer. I love Citra hops, so this was right up my alley. It was so juicy and bright and so drinkable at the same time. I loved it overall and only wish I could buy it more easily. 958 charactersbillab914, Nov 04, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Cheers to rmalinowski4 for sending this my way
Consumed 11/3/11
Appearance: A hazy, light golden orange - kind of a tangerine color, very pretty - little white head, fades to some good lacing
Smell: It's like I'm being punched in the face with tropical fruit - so, so good - orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango - very ripe, very juicy, not harsh in any way - citra may not actually be a variety of hops but rather some kind of magical substance (seems to be the most likely explanation) - some pale, earthy malts underneath
Taste: Despite the absolutely ridiculous aroma, this does taste like an APA, not an IPA - hops are still remarkable, though - orange, grapefruit, pineapple, some pine, and perhaps some apricot - a nice malt base - earthy, bready, but not too dirty - mostly a nice pale, light biscuit flavor
Mouthfeel: Medium body, nicely carbonated, very smooth, very crisp
Overall: If I'm ever turned into a zombie, I hope that I can be ground into dust that magically turns into this beer
This another beer that actually lives up to the hype. This is so ridiculously good. I would keep this in my fridge at all times if I could get more of it. Cheers to rmalinowski4 for sending me two bottles. 1,223 charactersangrybabboon, Nov 03, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a SA perfect pint glass
Initial pour was a nice muddy honey orange color with massive 3" frothy bone white head that hung around for a good 15 minutes before settling to a soapy ring. Lacing was very heavy.
Smell is probably the best aspect of this brew. Tons of ripe citrus just busting out of the glass. Citra hops and a touch of a malty undertone. Mostly smells of bitter hops and grapefruit.
Taste is good. Solid citrus tones, orange zest, mango, grapefruit that go along with the nice hop bite. 
Mouthfeel is also great. Slick with hop oils and bitter tingling on the tongue that lingers well into the next sip. Malt presence that leads to a dry finish. Good carbonation and excellent drinkability. 
Overall I'm glad I was able to attain this brew because it is not easy for me to get in PA. Great offering from FFF and I hope to be able to try it again in the future. As good or better than the other APAs out there. 938 charactershaywire77, Nov 02, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Moderate pour into Stone IPA glass produces a three finger frothy eggshell colored head. Retention is respectable, the head working its way back slowly leaving splotchy lacing clinging to the walls of the glass. A half finger cap remains atop for the duration. Body is a slight hazed pale orange color. If I wanted to nitpick I could complain about the clarity but this is a good looking beer and there is no reason to pick apart like that. 
Citra may be the trendy hop but it does not take much thought to figure out why. There may not be anything on the planet that smells as good as Citra hops. Huge tropical fruit aroma oozes fromt he glass. Mango, Guava, Pineapple and Tangerines. There is a bit of resin lying underneath. Very soft malt can be noticed buried benath.
The flavor is very similar to the aroma. Huge hop flavor dominates the palate. Three Floyd delivers this massive hop explosion while keeping the bitterness quite low. Slight pine and resinous flavor provides a bit of contrast keeping the sweeter fruity hop flavor in check. The malt is slightly more noticeable on the tongue. Sweet bready malt provide a subtle, clean base that allows the hops to shine.
The mouthfeel is on point. Medium bodied pale ale, carbonation is moderate, keeps the beer light on the tongue. Soft, almost oily texture on the tongue. The finish is rather dry, very crisp.
Zombie Dust is easily one of my favorite beers of the year, certainly my favorite Pale Ale. The aroma and flavor is just explosive without being overwhelming. Dangerously drinkable, there would not be an issue putting down a fair amount in a night. Flat out awesome beer. 1,643 characterskzoobrew, Nov 02, 2011

A - Pours a cloudy orange amber with a 1/2 finger beige head. A thin head and collar remain after initial dissipation. Lacing clings to the side of the glass.
S - Tropical fruit salad. Orange, grapefruit, pineapple and mango. One of the best smelling beers I have ever had.
T - There is a flash of honey sweetness and a hint of bready malt on the way in that is drenched by a tidal wave of citrus and tropical fruit sweetness. Loads of grapefruit and orange. Just a hint of pineapples. A mild piney hop bitterness that lingers long past the finish tops it all off.
M - Medium bodied with a finely bubbled carbonation that is aggressive for just a moment then fades pleasantly. No alchohol warmth.
O/D - This is the second time I've had this beer and I still can't find the words to express how good this is. Three Floyds is dead on with this one. Yeah, I just dropped that lame pun. 973 charactersLaCoursiere, Oct 31, 2011

S - Wonderful aroma, with citrus, both grapefruit and some orange pulp, tropical fruits, some nice florals, a bit of pine and some biscuit malt. 
T - The Citra hops provide not only the nice bitter grapefruit, but give a very juicy citrus taste as well, which is very enjoyable. Taste is also quite floral, with a nice biscuit malt presence. Very nice.
M - Medium mouthfeel, with a good amount of creaminess.
O - This is an excellent pale ale. The Citra hops aroma and taste profile are outstanding. 586 characterswarnerry, Oct 31, 2011

Playing: Stevie Wonder–Songs In The Key of Life (yes, I see the irony...)
A: Pours a well-filtered, bright golden copper. About a finger and a half of off–white sticky, lacy head forms and sits a while. 
S: Three Floyds really knows how to showcase Citra hops. This is a wonderful citrus bouquet–super peach and apricot forward. Some vanilla and sweet honey with a very light biscuity malt base.
T: Juicy, rich and quenching tropical fruits. Peach, mango, pineapple are at the forefront, with some piney, grassy bitterness balancing out the profile. 
M: Light to Medium-bodied, smooth and consistent carbonation showcases many levels of the fruity flavors in this beer.
O: This was a very hyped-up beer from the beginning, and it didn't disappoint. The approachable nature of Zombie Dust warrants the fanfare. It's reception, drinkability and subsequent market availability is reminiscent of its FFF comrade, Gumballhead. In fact, while I was drinking this, I felt as if I was drinking the zombie offspring of Hopslam and Gumballhead. Dangerously enjoyable–I feel like I could definitely enjoy six of these in a session. 1,195 charactersRHCP313, Oct 30, 2011

A- a cloudy golden color slightly orangish. Nice head with some lacing.
S- the smell hits you from go, its amazing and powerful. Its a blend of fresh hops with tropical fruit that just errupts from the glass. 3 Floyds should make this aroma into an air freshner. 
T- the hops and tropical fruit is back to play again along with some piney notes. Just a beautifully balanced taste.
M- Medium bodied beer with great carb
O- Overall this beer is Exceptional. The aroma is a thing of beauty that fills the room and gets you excited for your first sip.

had 2 pints it was so refreshing. the uber extra pale ale. well hop and cloudy. very dry hopped and a bit nougat sweet fruit. english yeast. cloudy yellow. with a nice protein sticky head. a bit exotic and a bit power house resilient hops... mid west favorite...due to the fact that it avoids the usual core hoping of amarillo, centennial , or cascade there for differentiating it. a nice accent and unique local note but also a very solid national beer to seek out. have it on tap though. i imagine its not that gold in the bottle after about 1 month. 607 charactersrtepiak, Oct 28, 2011

After pouring, the nose is absolutely gushing with aroma, ala signature FFF. Ton's of sharp pine, dank nuggets, mango skin...an amazing nose that I could smell all day. 
In the mouth, the balance is shocking. I mean, as a homebrewer, I know that there has got to be a shitload of hops in this beer, but with such balance, i'd bet the malt-bill is a bigger than you'd think. Perfectly carbonated. 
I don't think I need to say anything else. Just an amazing drinkin' beer from FFF. Ton's of complexity, yet something you could just kick back with. Highly recommended. 771 charactersvespahulb, Oct 28, 2011

Menu says 50 IBUs, but it packs a much bigger punch. Grassy, earthy nose that sings of hops, light fruit, and bitterness up front on top of caramel sweetness. Not a big beer, but doesn't taste light or watery at all--just not heavy. Smallish beer that showcases the hop bite for those with a zombie like craving for hops. 412 charactersFightingEntropy, Oct 26, 2011

Smell & Taste: The perfect pheromone. Blast of citrus, grapefruit, lemon, and pine accompanied by hints of malt. Slight hoppy bitterness in the finish, but in a very good way. Holy shit.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and spot-on carbonation, something FFF has mastered in my opinion.

4.64/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Big thanks to paco1029384756 for this gem.
Wow, just cracking the cap I can smell the awesome hops floating outwards into the world beyond the bottle. Pouring into the snifter just makes it even stronger. it does pour a fizzy almost 1 finger head that fades semi slowly and leaves a nice almost soapy spotty lacing that makes it look like a foam war just took place. The beer is a super hazy bright nectar orange color, barely any light getting through that fog.
Nose is just awesome before I even put my nose in the glass. It's like a wedding of Citra and Simcoe super fresh hops and they're spitting out babies into my nostrils. Going deeper brings so much fruit, tropical fruit mostly. A big citrus kick in the face with a slight orange zest, fresh squeezed grapefruit, waves of tropical fruit with some pineapple, guava, mango, and a big passion fruit kick. Damn! As I stuck my nose in deeper I get a bit of the beer on my nose and mustache, forcing me to lick it off, what a shame... back to the nose, a slight musty fresh wet hop resin comes through but lightly, and more of the tropical fruits with some nice tangerine and an overripe clementine. That's just the nose!
Taste also comes with fresh tropical fruit and deliciously delicious hops. The citrimcoe hop babies are having a party in my mouth and shedding hop oils everywhere. Awesome tropical fruits like I tried to say before my mind wandered. Anyways, tons of tropical fruits... and citrus. Nice orange rind, grapefruit, juicy tangerine, a really nice pineapple flavor. Then brings more of the guava, mango, and tons of passion fruit again. I can't tell if this beer is just ridiculously juicy or my mouth can't stop salivating, probably both. A light bitterness overall, which is nice so you can just enjoy the awesome tropical fruits of my labor. A slight fresh wet hop comes through bringing a slight musty resin but not much. Oh yeah, slight touch of malts as well, with a touch of sweetness and a nice backbone to prop up all the awesome hops so they can dig in deeper into the taste buds. I can't stop sipping this and I'll probably be done before this review is even finished. Finish comes with a bit more bitterness, a nice tropical fruit long finish, some light citrus and resin, such a long delicious finish as well that seems to last forever. Also drier on the finish.
Mouth is med bodied, decent carb.
Overall holy shit, I didn't think an APA could taste so awesome! So much fresh tropical fruit and awesome hops, like all the best parts of the hops got together and replicated until they couldn't anymore, and this is the byproduct. Bravo 3F, Bravo! 2,634 charactersjlindros, Oct 25, 2011

It pours a slightly hazy orange yellow with a 2 finger head of foam. Tilting my glass, I see some nice lacing; I *had* to do that right off the bat, without actually tasting it, as the foam is not shrinking one bit.
The smell, well...the brewer should be arrested for making an APA smell *this* good. lol. Loads of grapefruit with more than a hint of tropical fruits; not much of a malt profile in the aroma but I'm really not caring at this point.
The first sip is marvelous. As is the 2nd, and the 3rd. The flavour of grapefruit permeates my every taste bud but it does not come over as overly bitter. I can *just* sense a bit of the malt; a calming influence on that citrus blast, I reckon. Again, as in the smell, I get a hint or 2 of tropical fruity goodness. My oh my, I get it now..
Medium bodied with a light bit of carbonation, the mouthfeel is slick and quite nice. In the time it took me to type this, I now only have a couple of ounces left in my glass. Damn, this is good. 1,048 charactersBitterbill, Oct 25, 2011

Smell is big and luscious tangerines, citrus, orange pith, mangos and pine.

Medium bodied and creamy with tongue tickling carbonation. Juicy, refreshing. Finishes clean. 
Overall no surprise.. another great beer from 3Floyds and certainly one of the best APA's I've had. I would definitely seek this one out but would need restraint it's very very drinkable. 583 charactersJackieTH, Oct 24, 2011

Huge thanks to Kzoobrew for this awesome extra!!
App- A dark orange with some yellow running throughout. A bit clear with a 1/2 in pure white head that just stays put as the beer falls. Huge webbing and cling.
Smell- A nice soft but assertive aromatic profile. This has a large amount of tropical citrus but yet retains a good hop note with only a touch of bitter and a bit of malt backbone.
Taste- Taste the follows the nose but just tastes a little better. This is a bit more in line with a bigger "Hoppy Birthday" from Alpine. A good amount of flavors but just brewed a bit bigger. Floral, Citrus, a little bitter. 
Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonation. A very clean profile.

S: Floral, pine, malt, and bread aromas. Smells hoppy as can be. 
T: Piney and floral hops make their citrusy/grapefruit presence known early. Slightly sweet malt middle followed by a clean, dry bitter finish. 
M: Medium-bodied with medium carbonation. Well balanced beer.
O: Very aromatic and flavorful brew that is very enjoyable and worth repeating. 478 charactersPaincane, Oct 23, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to funkyaudio for the bottles!
A: Pours a light gold with stubborn white head. Leaves plenty of lace, but it's hard not to reach in for a sip after every swirl when it unleashes an aroma like this...
S: This beer is bursting at the seams with fresh, sweet hop aromas. Pine, malt, and bready undertones are all there too, but the fresh hops exhibited here are unmatched by any APA.
T: I don't like most APAs. I dislike hoppy beer in general, but this is incredibly good. Taste is full of hops, bitterness is kept in check by the strong malt backbone. Slightly sweet through the middle, then fades mildly bitter to finish dry. Best of style; superb!
M: Thin and light; properly carbonated. Everyone knows Zombies crave a big, creamy body, though. C'mon guys!
D/O: A refreshing beer with high drinkability. Wide appeal on this one -- it's a fantastic introduction to the world of craft brewing for your non-beer-geek friends. Can't wait for the day when FFF starts shipping to NYC! 990 charactersbrystmar, Oct 23, 2011

S - very nice tropical fruit aroma.
T - whoa, this beer is good! Tropical fruits upfront with a solid malty background finishing dry and slightly bitter.
F - medium bodied with smooth drinkability.

4.85/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cheers to czoch for this beer in a trade. Pours with a good head that settles down slowly. Nice lacing. Smells of citrus hops. Wow! This is extremely tasty! Smooth hops all around. Mouthfeel is really smooth. ABV is low so I could drink this all night. More of an IPA than Pale Ale but regardless of the classification, it is outstanding.
It's been a while since a beer blew me away but this one did. Seek it!

4.64/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Fantasyroach for kicking in a brace of these 12oz bottles as extras in a recent trade. Drunk as quick as possible. Great artwork, no bottled-on date that I can see.
A. Deep dull copper orange. Beauteous tight foamy head, big lacing... nothing wrong here.
S. Great mother of hop cones! Supremely "right on" nose... bold bright Citra hops, bucketloads, nay, TRUCKLOADS of tangerine, mandarin orange, peach candy, sweet sticky malt, a touch of kumquat, tropical! smooth, candy-like... and yet, you know there are real hops here.
T. Oh heavens... sweet, succulent, soft, creamy, marriage of hops & grain sugars, yet not syrupy or cloying. Everything here just blends so much into the other that the fruity hops and sugar-kissed malt are the same flavor. Citra delight. I don't know what magic FFF has worked here, but it goes together so well that it is immediately iconic. I hate sounding like a shill, but there it is.
M / D. Thick, creamy, soft. Powder-dry finish, but until then, this is simply so soft and silly to drink as to be delightful; it practically gallops down your throat. Could be a touch less dry, maybe? There is a (very) minor metallic note here that only bears mentioning because you have to find fault somewhere. You can drink Zombie Dust all day. I sure would... the finish is a minor mirror of the flavor, but isn't too bitter, or sweet, but just fades... away.
Dark Lord bless Three Floyds. Sometimes their schtick of huge, malt forward beer doesn't really work for me, but this thing... is... great. Is this the best American Pale Ale? Too soon to say, surely, but Zombie Dust makes a compelling case. Ugh, what am I going to do with my remaining one? 1,691 characterskkipple, Oct 22, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Picked up a sixer from the brewery. 12 ounce bottle poured in a pint glass. 
A - Pours a golden amber. Cloudy with lots of little carbonation bubbles. Fluffy 1 1/2 finger white head that recedes slowly and leaves lots of sticky lacing. 
S - Strong piney hopes. Earthy and floral tones. grapefruit and other tropical fruits (bit of pineapple, mango). Hops are on full display here and they smell delicious. 
T - Wow. This is incredible. Orange and mango citrus compliment a huge hop bouquet. The hop profile is quite a bit more pronounced than a standard APA. The malt backbone really carries this for me. Just incredible Supremely balanced. Tastes like an IPA without the heat, and high ABV.
M - Medium bodied and oily. Carbonation adds a slight tinge. 
If only every APA could be this good. This is phenomenal. Well done FFF. 831 characterslangm12, Oct 22, 2011

Look: See through orange with a 1/4 inch head and no real retention

Taste: To be honest based on the nose I really expected more from this beer. The flavor matches the nose just in a more muted form
Mouthfeel: Medium body and medium carbonation and goes down incredibly smooth

The citra hops and fruity nose are fantastic on this beer.
A really nice balance of of grapefruit and fruit taste with the hops being much more subtle than I expected. This is just a really well balanced and delicious beer.

4.54/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This label is amazing, but with Three Floyds you typically get some pretty awesome label designs. The beer itself looks good, but not quite as cool as the label. It's a slightly hazed copper-sunset-gold sort of color, various shades running throughout depending how the light hits it, and the head is fluffy and just slightly off-white.
Aroma? Just freaking amazing. A big, cool, shiny blast of extremely bright and zippy hops. Fallback descriptors like "piney" and "citrusy" just won't cut it here. It's a ton of both, but quite a ways beyond. It's magical, that's what.
Flavor brings things slightly down to earth (or at least, not as far out into the galaxy as the aroma), with prickly yet pleasing doses of mango-like spiciness, grapefruit peel, lime zest, sticky kind bud, dryer sheet, and a certain rye-like graininess that adds its own spicy twist and makes sure some malt character nudges in to the spotlight that shines on the big, bold hops. But with all this "yeah, yeah, hops!!" talk, it's a really well-balanced and even approachable beer. I can see why it's classified as an APA: virtually no alcohol heat, and nothing over the top on either the hop or malt side...just an extremely flavorful and hop-centric beer that happens to have a relatively low ABV. More magic, more magic.
Feel is decent enough, very much true to style, buoyant and lighter body with ample and just-right carbonation. But nothing more to report in this department.
I'm so freaking glad I picked this up during a visit to Three Floyds. They better keep this one on their roster as a permanent deal. Seek it out!!! 1,605 charactersMetalmonk, Oct 18, 2011

Nose is amazing. Hugh whiffs of pine and resin. Than the grapefruit peeks through followed by some tropical fruit. How is this not an IPA?
Citrusy hops shock the taste buds right away. Big grapefruit and orange zest. A true hop showcase. Malt does enough to help the drinkability. Finish is dry and bitter with hops sticking to the taste buds.
Overall..the best pale ale around. 502 characterschicano4craft, Oct 18, 2011

A- Pours a golden orange with a one-finger sudsy white head. Visually, the carbonation is highly present.
S- Grapefruit, mandarin oranges, pineapple, citrus peel, and a muted pine aroma
T- Grapefruit, some orange and tropical fruits with remote pine at the finish
M- Light to medium mouthfeel. The carbonation is much more present in the appearance than it is during consumption, although it does seem to make it a little more creamy.
O- This is an awesome pale ale. The proportion of the flavors is amazing. It goes down so smoothly that I could see drinking a six pack with no problem. 630 charactersUngertaker, Oct 18, 2011

I've been getting a bit down on the beer scene lately (I don't have much time, I need to get some beers out to people, yada yada yada). I was hoping he'd send me a bottle, and unsolicited he sent me a whole package. Thanks dude. 
Pours a slightly orange golden yellow. Surprisingly hazy. White foamy crust with some bubbling. 
Smells like mandarin oranges, some grapefruit rind, some nice sweet grapefruit, and a bit of tropical pineapple/papaya. Basically, this is a medley of hops and smells fucking great. 
Taste is surprisingly sweet-forward. This isn't your typical pale ale, I'd say the tropical/orange flavors take center stage and the grapefruit is as much sweet as bitter, and not much pine to be found. Wow. Just great.
I would buy this every day if available around me. I suppose could use a bit more carbonation for the abv, but a great brew. 904 charactersOverlord, Oct 18, 2011

Acquired via trade
Thanks dannyfrost!
Deep orange and amber with an inch-high off-white head--spiderwebs of lace left down the glass. Gorgeous.
Wow! What an aroma! This is a tropical nose from the Gods. Heavenly aroma of smashed nectarine, apricot, mango, and guava. This is pure tropics! I'd, literally, wear this as a cologne (is that weird?).
More tropical fruit flavors dominate, more than I've had perhaps in any beer ever, and certainly more than in any other pale ale. Low to moderate bitterness makes this one incredibly drinkable. This is about as perfect as an APA that exists--it almost takes the crown from Alpine's Hoppy Birthday and The Bruery's Humulus Wet (but not quite!).
Medium bodied with somewhat high carbonation per the style.
This is one of those beers that makes you say silly things like "I'd trade for this beer just so I could dump it on my head." 895 charactersehammond1, Oct 18, 2011

Poured to Half Acre pint glass. 
Pours slightly darker than mustard and glows beautifully. A nice egg shell white head forms that has really nice retention. I expected a map of lacing drawn out for me, but instead I was greeted by none. It doesn't change the fact that this is a beautiful beer. 
Vivid tropical fruit notes that get muted by some sweet malt and beautiful Citra hops. 
Taste follows the nose, but is amplified tremendously. Juicy, juicy pineapples and slight lemon come forth in the mouth. It has that nice malt that makes this an APA and the nice Citra hops. 
Mouthfeel is spot on with a nice medium body and a slight creamy feeling. Very smooth and goes down nicely on a warm day. 
The perfect beer for an afternoon spent watching football. I could session these things all day. I'm really glad I liked this one so much too, since a lot of FFF brews have been letting me down lately. 982 charactersDearthVader, Oct 16, 2011

4/5  rDev -11.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is a very good beer. It pours nicely, a cloudy orange color with a very fluffy head. It smells floral and strong. This brew has an interesting taste. It is more like an IPA (those looking for a more mellow APA should stay away), but it is quite complex. The flavors accentuate flowers and grapefruit at first, and then finish with a strong IPA-like bitterness. It is a nice balance. The mouthfeel is also very unique. It is almost creamy, like warm milk with slight carbonation, and it somehow works pretty well. A nice job on this one. 541 charactersmentaltraveller, Oct 15, 2011

T: Sweet citrus/tropical fruits, lots of floral perfume-y notes; basically tastes just like it smells
M: Light-bodied, medium carbonation; crisp and refreshing

T.Wow! My first thought was that this was the fresher lighter brother of Hopslam. I enjoyed the lower alcohol and the insnely fresh citra hop flavors.

A - Pours a burn orange with a pen width white head. Lots of carbonation and good lacing.
S - citrus hops and some piney resin, followed by some biscuitty malt character.
T - Very similar to the nose. Loads of citrus and tropical fruit flavors. The pine notes that were on the nose are a little more subtle on the palate. The malt sweetness creeps in at the back end giving this a nice balance.
M - Medium body, medium carbonation. Resiny hops are left on the palate.
O - I'll definitely be seeking this one out again, it's crazy good. Really like the low ABV as I can see myself kicking back quite a few of these. A very nice APA. 689 charactersJefe73, Oct 13, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It's hard to say anything bad about this beer. I think it's world class in almost every way. When I think about a beer I could drink everyday, this is it. It pours a golden, near orange color with delicate carbonation bubbles and a sufficient head. The aroma is intoxicating, due to grapefruit and other citrus notes rather than alcohol. 
The taste has just the right amount of everything. It's hoppy enough to let you know care went into the hop profile yet sweet and slightly earthy at the same time. The citrus from the nose doesn't betray the palate. I wouldn't call it rich but rather drinkable. I could certainly make a six pack enjoyably last through a full sunday of football. I haven't had many APAs and maybe this is setting the bar high but the balance is exactly what I wish I found in more IPAs. 809 charactersrobboyd, Oct 13, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is like the tenth time I've drank Zombie Dust but only the first time that my pallet/brain have been unfried enough to give it a proper evaluation. 
I poured it and made a gross little noise, like a dude in gay porn. Then I smelled and made another gross noise, although it was less gross because it was louder and less nebbishy. Then I tasted it and flat out moaned, like a female porn star, and that shit's hot because it's something a woman would do.
There's nothing I can say, really, aside from that this is a damn near perfect APA. The hop profile is medium-strength citrus, the malt is of the perfect strength, and the aftertaste is a wonderful tang of alpha acids against the pleasant stultifaction of yeasty bread dough. It's one of those truly great sessionable beers, like Masala Mama or Red Racer, that exceeds the sum of its parts because it so perfectly balanced. 
 L-let this be a lesson to all you kids out there: if you're gonna review a beer, do it right. The first few times I had this I thought it was real good, but I was in no state to pass final judgment. 1,086 charactersmynie, Oct 12, 2011

Pours a bright, clear copper with a nice foamy white head. 
Smells of very floral and citrus hops with some wet grain in the middle with almost a skunky, burnt rubber aroma to it. Oddly pleasant from someone who loves a good burnout.
Canned pear, pineapple, floral and citrus notes, mild bitterness, and wet pale malts. The fruit notes come back in the finish.
Light to medium bodied with even carbonation.
I am looking forward to trying this on a different occasion with a clean palate. I would pick up Daisy Cutter before this if they were side by side but this is FFF, so its worth a grab as well. 668 charactersphiberoptik, Oct 12, 2011

S: Amazing citrus notes!  Over ripe peach for sure.  Orange.  Pineapple.  Maybe some mild bready malts behind everything.

4.47/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Azurescens for sending this as an extra in a trade. 
Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy orange color with moderately high carbonation. About 3/4" of off-white head forms that has nice retention and lacing. 
Smell: A hoppy pale ale. Lots of citrus, orange rind, grapefruit. A nice amount of caramelly and biscuity malts to accompany. Very nice.
Taste: A nice malty, caramel sweetness up front, followed by excellent orange and grapefruit rind and other citrus notes. Extremely well balanced, but does lean towards the hops side. And the hop character in this beer is very tasty.
Mouthfeel/Overall: Between light and medium bodied, with nice fine carbonation. A bit fuller than many pale ales out there. Overall, the best example of this style I've tried. Really reminds me somewhat of Gumballhead as far as hop character, but unlike that beer, this has a nice malted barley presence to balance that wheat doesn't provide. Very impressed. 953 characterszhanson88, Oct 09, 2011

4.63/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Hazy orange color with a modest white head that leaves good lacing.
Pineapple and tangerine on the nose lead to a big citrus flavor. One of the biggest hop punches at a relatively low abv - the hops are on par with a dipa. Unlike other lighter hop monsters, this one is well balanced and seductively smooth.
There is a sweetness to the malt but it is well hidden - the malt provides an almost transparent foundation for the hops showcase. Good round mouthfeel with a dry finish that just seem to make this beer seem better and better and then, much too soon. it is gone. 
Thanks to immobilisme for the bottle. 612 charactersCliffBrake, Oct 09, 2011

First had this on tap at FFF last November when it was rolled out as Cenotaph.
Honey-gold, clear elixir poured into SA glass. Thick one-finger white head, tightly grouped tiny bubbles, abundant lacing.
Wow those hops really stink up the room--in grand fashion.
Fresh grapefruit but more sweet mango, lemon and subtle pine backing. All you could hope for in an APA and really more like a finely tuned IPA.
The taste does not disappoint. Tingling hop bitterness on the tip of the tongue, smooth pine and citrus exploding everywhere else.
The classic experience that all devoted hopheads search for.
Nicely carbonated, medium body, sweet, hop lingering aftertaste. Love the relatively low ABV which allows for a few more "tastings". Really can't overstate this fact, as to me, having a "session" IPA/APA of this caliber shows the artistry of the brewers and their ability to create such a fine brew and not need to jack up the alcohol. Giving additional weight to the above facts tips this brew into the rarified air of Exceptional. 1,132 charactersCaptCleveland, Oct 08, 2011

A - Pours a slightly hazy nice orange color with some nice copper hints. There is a nice 1 inch off-white head that is very dense and sticky. Very nice looking beer.
S - Wow. Sweet mango and tangerines and some nice citra notes. There is some slight pine notes and resiny notes. Aroma is soo attractive. There is some slight malty and bready notes. Very nice toasted grain notes are present. 
T & M - Flavor starts off with some nice citric qualities. Very nice orange peel notes with some tangerine and slight mango sweetness. The beer is nice and refreshing. Very light yet flavorful. There is some nice toasty malt grain notes mixed in with the citrus notes. There is some nice slight pine notes in the flavor as well but its mostly a delicious citrus bomb. The finish is nice and bitter with some slight sticky sweetness and resin notes on the backend. Very good brew. Mouthfeel is nice and light with some crisp carbonation. 
O - Very good brew. The Citra hops really shine. Good FFF brew. 1,030 charactersJoEBoBpr, Oct 08, 2011

*From notes
-- A BIG thanks goes out to both brydeen and Señor Lopez for hookin' a white boy up with some Three Floyds deliciousness. --
A: Unfiltered dark amber. Quite dark, in fact, for an APA which I really dig. A generous pour (split with ol' Johnny Boy) yields a killer two finger head and lacing so epic it's makin' Roland Emmerich jealous.
S: I'm goin' coo-coo for Zombie Dust. The nose here is wicked - there's a menthol, vapo-rub essense to it that's just incredible. Piney. Floral. Juicy. Wow.
T: Is this an IPA? Beacause it certainly drinks like it. The citra hops explode onto the palate, creating a tropical, juicy and scrumdiddlyumptious APA. And like the best in style, there's a well structured and solid, golden malt spine that keeps the beer perfectly unbalanced.
M: Hellaciously creamy. This monster is over the top frothy. The carbonation is spot-on, and the texture is like a Michael Jordan after party: off the chain. This APA is luxurious and insanely approachable.
O: Three Floyds Zombie Dust changes the APA game. Who knew you could have your hops and (reasonably) low ABV all wrapped into one majestic package? This is crazy good. Seek it out at any cost.
Oh, and the label is pure badass. 1,274 charactersRhettroactive, Oct 08, 2011

Pours with a finger of fluffy thin head that falls to a thin cap of foam that stays for the duration. The lightest haze is present in this orange/gold colored beer. Some strands of carbonation escape. Just a splotch of lace.
Aroma is bright and fresh. A blast of citrus, but the more you enjoy the light toasted malt comes through. Smells a bit like a Grateful Dead concert.
Nice APA. Fresh flavor, bright. Toasted malt beneath the green grassy and citrus hops. While very hop forward, this is still definitely an APA vs. IPA. Some nice fruit mid palate.
Body is still fairly light and bright. Refreshing beer.
Really good. Not a Daisy Cutter classic, but very very good. 761 charactersReagan1984, Oct 08, 2011

A- Nice orange/amber color with two fingers of snow white foam. Head recedes slowly leaving a thick coaster and some very nice lacing. 
S- Huge citrus presence in the nose. Pine and a bit of malt squeak through, but notes of orange, tangerine and grapefruit overpower them. Smells great!
T- Opens with mild grapefruit, apricot and hemp. Signature Citra hop flavor. Nice bitterness mid-palate, followed by subtle, biscuity malt balancing things out momentarily. Finishes with a mild bitterness. Bittersweet aftertaste lingers a bit.
M- Medium body. Medium carbonation. Smooth, creamy texture. 
O- I really enjoyed this. The nose combined with the citrus and hemp flavors are remeniscent of a good IPA. The nice biscuity malt bill smooths things out, and the creamy feel make this a refreshing, insanely drinkable brew. I'd have this regularly if it was available in Cali. Recommended. 1,014 charactersSideswipe, Oct 07, 2011

Poured from the white/green labeled bottle w/ Zombie Dust in Green & a Zombie wearing a crown on the front into a Crown Royal Shaker Glass. No freshness date since its a FFF brew.
Aroma- A refreshing and strong grapefruit aroma starts out this APA. Malts are evident too in a medium fashion, and then citra hops evident. 
Appearance- Pours a 1 finger head that stays for appropriate time. Has a semi-hazy, golden body but then there is no lacing afterwards. 
Flavor- Awesome FFF hop blend used! Citra and grapefruit are the biggest characteristics in here and the hop bitterness is medium. Very enjoyable all the way through as well as balanced.
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, and leaves hop on the palate but not much else. 
Overall Impression- Simply fantastic! This was tough to compare to Alpha King but have to say I enjoy this one more (from memory). Will be looking back @ my Alpha King review and seeing how it compares. This one definitely had some malt aroma/flavor that helped balance out the taste and make more characteristics happen. Will be getting this one again, and hopefully in a 6-pack or more! 1,232 charactersDCon, Oct 06, 2011

T: Excellent malty base over milder hops. Perhaps they've faded a little. This is a quality APA that would have been a little better if it were fresh.

Definitely fresh; should be after standing in the carry out line for almost an hour as this had turned out to be most popular after its recent release. 
A - Very nice amber color with moderate carbonation. Poured a one inch head with nice lacing. 
S - Nice fruity aroma with grapefruit and floral coming through. 
T - Excellent and smooth; tastes great, less filling. The grapefruit, orange, and citrus are up front. Very nice finish with some hoppiness but definitely not a tongue bruiser. IPA and pale ales are my favorite styles and this one is probably the leading contender for my new favorite. It seems smoother and more tasty than this brewer's very excellent Alpha King. Consistent with the style, the bitterness not as pronounced as an IPA.
M - Very clean with that very smooth citrus lingering at the finish.
Thanks to rjhami for the reminder to stop in Munster to pick up this excellent example of a pale ale. 1,011 charactersBluetrekrider, Oct 06, 2011

4.56/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pale golden in color with just a little haze in it. Slightly foamy white head but doesn't last too terribly long. Just a wee bit of carbonation as well.
S/T - Pretty much confirms why I love citra hops. Even from the very beginning of the pour the scent of citrus fruit fills the air and just intensifies when sniffed. The taste follows suit with a huge chewy hop flavor which is dominated by lemon zest, grapefruit, and tangerine. Leaves a nice resin aftertaste but not too drying or bitter.
M - Medium body with plenty of carbonation. Not too sticky on the palate and aftertaste lasts and lasts. Very easy to drink.
O - A pretty awesome APA, if not one of the best. Definitely worth seeking out and nothing bad to say about it. 736 charactersVaTechHopHead, Oct 04, 2011

Served in an imperial pint glass with 2 finges worth of creamy dense white head. Clear pale golden body, it was kind of dim in the pub to get a good color comparison. Great lacing and good head retention as I consume this hyped beer.
Smells very good and it does live up to the hype here. It smells like a citra and simcoe hopped beer. Citrus and mango, some pine, cat pee yet in a good way. This smells amazing!
Tastes some what similar in the big citrus and mango like fruit flavor. Some sweet and bready malts help keep it balanced. A fairly complex piney resinous undertone keep it interesting. A firm citrus, piney oily coating finish round out the taste.
Mouthfeel is medium, with a nice carbonation to compliment the oily finish. 
Overall this beer was worth the drive, even though we had a few others after this one, I liked this one the most. The smell and taste are very good in every. I may hunt some more of this down in a trade later on, after the hype dies down.

4.77/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy gold color with a huge 2 finger foamy beige head that had tons of bubbles in it and faded very slowly, leaving a creamy layer on top and excellent lacing coating the sides. This beer was so murky that it looked like ocean water with bubbles racing up all over the place.
Smells of huge hops up front, with a wet hop aroma lead by citrus hops that had grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, orange peel, pineapple, piney hops/pine cones, floral hops, flowers, herbs, coriander, caramel, brown sugar, butter soaked toast, crackers and some faint spices the seem like the hops were wrung out and dripped citrus fruit and hop oils into this brew. This does not have an classic APA aroma, and is more like a DIPA, which was a very pleasant surprise. This smells like a wet hop cone is floating in the glass, with a whiff of buttery grainy biscuit before more fruit kicks in. One of the best smelling APA’s that I’ve ever encountered as this beer would fool most people into thinking that they were dinking a massive IPA.
Tastes like it smells, with huge hops up front including citrus hops, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, orange peel, pineapple, mango, piney hops, pine cones, floral hops, flowers, herbs, fresh cut grass, hay, coriander, brown sugar, caramel, sweet malt, butter, crackers, biscuit and just enough grains to really neutralize any spice bite. This beer is all about the hops and the balance may be off a bit for an APA, but the grains and malts play just enough of a part to make this incredibly drinkable and succulent. 
Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with very light mild carbonation that borders on thin and watery; it has a medium chewy body and a slick oily feel as it slides across the tongue; the alcohol is very well covered up and there is only a little hop heat that goes well with the sweet fruity finish that’s on the bitter side. After the swallow my mouth was dry with a slight sour pucker and a lingering fruity hop sweetness. 
Overall this was a great beer that went down real easy for me. The massive hop flavors and aroma may indicate that this beer could be classified as an IPA, but who really cares what the style is because it was delicious. Thanks to my friend Justin for hooking me up with some kick ass Three Floyds straight from the brewery. I highly recommend this beer and will be seeking it out again as it was ridiculously smooth and outstanding overall. An absolute session beer for me that I could drink anytime and all the time. 2,488 charactersCHickman, Oct 03, 2011

Beer pours a hazy dark orange/copper color with a finger and a half of soapy and foamy off white head. Head recedes quickly, leaving a lot of sticky lacing, to a thin film over the surface and a collar of small bubbles. Very hazy beer, but you can still see a few shadows through the beer, with a good amount of small slow bubble carbonation near the edges of the glass.
Nose is pretty good, light grapefruit peel, dank pine needles, a little touch of floral like hops. A nice caramel malt presence comes through as well. As it warms, I get a little bit of stone fruit, and tropical fruit aromas, fairly muddled though. 
Taking a sip, there were more tropical fruits on the tongue than in the nose, sweet stone fruit and lighter tropical fruits, grapefruit. A touch of pine and floral hop flavors as well. Mid tongue, a nice caramel and grain malt presence, continuing into a nice and dry finish with a balance of light hops and malt. 
Light body with a crisp and refreshing carbonation that's perfect for the style. While not quite a light ABV beer, I wouldn't mind having a few of these. Very nice beer. 1,142 charactersnataku00, Oct 02, 2011

4.56/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally having this again after drinking at Dark Lord Day, thanks to a trade with claaark13 - it was amazing then, so let's see how my memory holds up . . .
Yeah, it's still pretty amazing. Once you crack this bottle open, the room is instantly filled with that fresh hop aroma (someone should make candles out of Citra Hops), and the pour just brings out more fruity hop notes.
While the appearance is a little less than to be desired from a pale ale (looks more like a DIPA, honestly), the taste is so clean and crisp that you drink it so fast you can barely look at it. Loads and loads of clean hop characters - pineapple, lemon, peach - all the usual suspects are there, with just a touch of bitterness.
For pale ales, and IPA's and DIPA's for that matter, I prefer the clean fruit over bitterness - if you're looking for the opposite, this may not be for you. However, if you're looking for an almost perfect, unique, and super clean American Pale Ale, look no further.

A - Pours an almost perfectly clear yellow-amber, with a billowy three fingers of head. Outstanding retention and lacing. This looks as good as I imagine is possible. 
S - Peachy, citrusy aromas come bounding out of the glass on the pour, along with a slight candy sweetness. Man I love Citra hops! The nose isn't overly complex, but what is there is outstanding and plentiful.
T - It reminds me a lot of fresh Blind Pig, with lots of fruit-forward hoppiness, but without the overwhelming bitterness in the finish. Peach, mango, and grapefruit in there, with a touch of pine. Very, very nice. 
M - It's by no means a lightweight beer, but it's very crisp and also slightly dry. It would be great on a warm summer day (too bad summers here are oppressively hot).
O - I've been a little hard on FFF in the past -- their DIPAs just haven't really done it for me -- but this beer is the real deal. They've managed to pack a lot of the aspects that I enjoy in an IPA/DIPA into an APA. I love it, and I'll be trading for as much as I can manage in the future. 1,226 charactersdjmichaelk, Oct 01, 2011

M- Very high carbonation and some very nice acidity, finishes very dry, almost champagne like

The flavor is a tremendous party of glorious hops! There is a lot of citrus flavor, pine and that bitter twist of lemon peel. The flavor has this sweet, delicate finish. I don't know how that can be after all the bold flavors. 
The beer is actually quite clean for mouthfeel. The flavors end with adelicate and clean finish. 
This is a tremendous beer. Hop head will love it. The hops are on parade in ways the are both bold and subtile. Three Floyds is not available in my area. I will be looking for more excuses for road trips! 733 characterswampahoofus, Oct 01, 2011

T-as expected, grapefruit. Tangy citrusy hoppyness galore. It really does taste like grapefruit lambic without the sour character. I had always heard citra hops added a lemon flavor, which is somewhat there, but this is very grapefruity. Just the slightest hint of caramel malt in the middle. Average bitterness for an american pale.
M- thin and sticky. Bubbly enough where it is light and drinkable but that hop lupulin makes it reeeally sticky. Yum.
O- a great pale ale. Standard to high on the bitter factor. Its a little one dimensional in flavor, but that's not to say it isn't verrry good. Think straight citrus. I'll have again, if I can find it... 961 charactersznichols, Sep 30, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Acquired from decadance in our recent trade, so a big THANK YOU goes out to him!
Poured in to a pint glass.
A: This beer pours a hazy light copper color with a one finger of foamy bone white head. Head recedes nicely and leaves wisps of lacing on the glass. 
S: Nose is very fruity at the forefront, pineapple, mango, lemon and grapefruit.
T: Taste starts with pineapple and mango at the forefront. Middle has a bit of grainy, bready malt presence. Finish has a nice lemon, grapefruit zest with some left over pineapple flavoring in the aftertaste.
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, oily body with a dry finish.
O: Goes down easy, very tasty, not too filling, decent kick, a bit more IPA than APA, but a fantastic beer that I would absolutely hit up all the time. 770 charactersJayli, Sep 30, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from 12oz. bottle into imperial pint glass.
Obtained bottle in trade w/ Barfwin. (Thanks Mike!)
Aroma: Mmmm, sweet, pungent citrus and tropical fruit notes. Grapefruit, lemon, and pineapple. Light brown sugar malty sweetness.
Appearance: 1 finger off-white head falls very slowly. Body is a hazy orange-bronze. Nice Belgian lace washes onto the inside of the glass with each sip.
Flavor: Tropical mango and pineapple fruity sweetness. Light grapefruit. Malty cereal grain, followed by some mild, but not overwhelming/harsh, bitterness from the middle through the end.
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and body. Hop tannins do not come through as being drying.
Overall: While I was a bit skeptical about whether this one could live up to all the hype, it turned out to be the best APA I've ever had... Another EXTREMELY well-done showing by Three Floyds. Do yourself a favor and get a bottle of this one! 912 charactersmdvatab, Sep 30, 2011
4.71/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Three Floyds Zombie Dust is a good crisp American Pale Ale. Great, in fact. Fruity and hoppy on the nose and up front in the taste. Crisp at the back. A touch drying, but clean, and well-balanced by caramel and bready malts. Lace hangs all over the glass like lingerie in an early morning hotel room.
Hazy copper, the taste is bold without being over aggressive. It doesn't beat up your palate and you know it's still an APA. Not one of those super-hopped Indian ones.
Big thank you to Dan out in Chicagoland for sending this my way. It's truly a fine product.
And this is a much shorter review than normal because I'm headed up to Vermont to compare this to Hill Farmstead's Edward. They're in the same league. 714 charactersafksports, Sep 30, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is by far the best IPA I have ever had. I was excited to learn that Three Floyd started to bottle it. Although it is a rare find, I got my hands on some at Whole Foods in Chicago. I poured the beer into a stemless wine glass to appreciate the foggy golden color and offers a heavy mango aroma with hints of pineapple, floral and miscellaneous citrus scents. The first sip bites your tongue with the sting of hops like other IPAs, however the aftertaste doesn't linger, it finishes clean leaving a delightful taste behind. The carbonation floats down the side and reflects the light to shimmer, it such a way that it looks like it could be zombie dust! It is a very refreshing brew, and offers interesting comic artwork by Tim Seeley. I highly recommend if you can find it! 777 charactersStevenSpringer, Sep 28, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured into a sniffer, thanks to who ever brought this to the tasting.
Appearance: Hazy golden-yellow with a thin white head that clings to the side of the glass.
Aroma: WOW! Basically like sticking your nose into a bag of hops! Citrus, pine, and pineapple are assaulting my nose. 
Taste: Pineapple, citrus, pine and peach are the flavor I get from this beer. It's surprisingly light and has a nice malt backing.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium-high carbonation with a dry lingering finish. Very drinkable.
Overall: This is the craziest pale ale I have ever had, it's hard not to call it an IPA. Easily the best pale ale I have ever drunk. 647 charactersjamescain, Sep 28, 2011

12oz bottle poured into Stone IPA glass.
A- The beer pours a hazy golden color with a white frothy/bubbly head that resides to a ring and clings to the glass.
S- I'm picking up major hops with citrus notes as well as a very faint crayon type smell that is very pleasant in this. My wife takes a big sniff and says "mmm smells like sweet georgia peaches"
T- Big hops, grapefruit, orange, fresh cut grass and once again my wife informs me she tastes sweet and sour peach candies.
M- Fairly sticky mouthfeel with good carbonation.
0- This is a fantastic Pale Ale and my wife claims it is the best smelling beer she has experienced, which is actually saying a lot.
Thanks again Carleton. 745 charactersBdubleEdubleRUN, Sep 28, 2011

A- Pours a beautiful golden hue with nice 1.5" head and decent lacing.
S- This is how an APA should smell. Very hoppy with sweet citrus undertones.
T- Very hop forward but in a good way. Sweet citrus backdrop just like the smell. Leaves the palate nice and clean
M- Nice carbination without feeling pop-like and a smooth dry finish
O- Amazing APA and probably my current favorite beer. Not a huge FFF fan (I know, weird right?) but this one is certainly a winner. Go find this right now and drink til your heart is content 567 characterspschul4, Sep 27, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 412 oz bottle. Generous extra from dougofthefuture. Thanks Doug. Pours a cloudy golden amber with a small white head that has good retention and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is wonderful. Huge mango, light pineapple, light grapefruit, and some light honey. This is definitely a Citra hopped beer. The initial taste is some sweet mango that goes into a light breadiness with a bit of pineapple. The finish has some biscuit, more mango as well as a light bitterness. Light, slick mouthfeel and a relatively low carbonation. Great beer. I would love to be able to drink this regularly. 608 charactersjethrodium, Sep 26, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into my DFH Snifter. Really excited to finally get to try this!
A--Poured a dull orange with lots of light coming through it. Eggshell head that was fluffy on the pour and dissipated slowly. Tons of lacing throughout the beer.
S--Hop-forward. Then comes the citrus. Papaya, mango, pineapple, lemon peel. There's also some funk on the nose. Perhaps from the hops, also like that of a pine cone or fresh-cut grass.
T--Fantastic citrus on the palate. The mango and pineapple are at the forefront. The hops are present, but not overpowering. Bitter aftertaste.
M--Medium bodied with little-to-no-carbonation. Thick head at the beginning. A little bit oily.
O--This was an amazing offering from FFF. It reminds me, honestly, of Gumball Head. This would be my everyday go-to pale ale if it were accessible to me. Fantastic. 845 charactersMosley1212, Sep 25, 2011

Pours a nice golden orange haze with a big sticky off white head. The lacing on this one is sticky and hangs around. Smell is an absolute knockout. Huge pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine notes. Citrus goodness just dominates the aroma. I feel like I'm at an outdoor farmers market selling only tropical fruit. Taste is only a slight notch below the smell with the bulk of that citrus hitting you square in the palate. The tail end of the taste has a hint of grass included with the citrus. Mouthfeel is solid though a bit dryer at the end than I expected. This beer really goes down easy though. This is another winner from Three Floyds and one that I will always have on my wants list. 779 characterssmokeypeat, Sep 25, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Mark for this bottle in our recent trade. Bottle art is ridiculous and shows an armored hammer wielding zombie wearing a cape and kings crown. One of the most bad ass labels I have ever seen. Poured into Duvel tulip at 50 degrees.
A: Strong pour down the center of the glass produces a two finger off white head that recedes very slowly. Beer is a beautiful golden color and pretty hazy. After two minutes there is still a very pillowy head on top of this. Looks beautiful in the glass. 4.5
S: The nose on this is very good. Tons of super fresh heady smelling hops....some of the best ever. Lots of grapefruit maybe even coconut. This one just smells super fresh very floral and piney, incredible. 5.0
T: I'm completely blown away by this beer it is great. Tons of hops with a very nice bitterness but not too over bearing. Picking up a sweetness of pineapple, apricot flavors a little malt. Great tasting beer. 4.80
M: Mouthfeel is very nice good carbonation level. Super slick on the teeth leaving an oily coating. Again this beer is on point with a very nice mouthfeel. 4.5
O: Overall I am thoroughly enjoying this beer. The hype around this beer is justified and this comment will lead to that hype but this one really will not disappoint. Although this is an APA it hangs with pliny, sculpin, abner, etc. without question. If you have a chance to try this definitely don't miss out. 4.5 1,406 charactersslentz, Sep 24, 2011

A: Golden wheat colored and fairly hazy, I can barely see through it. Minimal head. Good amount of sticky lacing.
S: Lots of citrus, but really pretty sweet. I smell some honeycomb. Clover? Lots of bready malts as it warms. Pineapple. Very light and refreshing. Nicely balanced
T: Whoa, this is not what I expected from the nose…really not sure what's going on at first. Very sweet. Watermelon, strawberries. Once I pinpointed the watermelon, which took awhile, it was the main thing I could taste. Pretty grassy finish that's much more bitter than the rest of the taste.
M: Refreshing, smooth and crisp, not much of a lingering aftertaste.
O: Well this is interesting. Not like anything I've ever really tasted before, and a really fresh take on the style for me. I really like the change of pace. The disparity between the nose and taste is a little bit confusing, but that's about the only complaint I have. 969 characterstsatem, Sep 24, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- 1 finger white head that turns foamy and bubbly and little lacing. The body is orangy in tue middle of the glass and a paler yellow around the edges. 
S- real big citrus scent thats awesome. Orange, pineapple and mango are all over the place with a sharp slight bitter hop toward the end of the scent. Kudos FFF.
T- quite surprised to run into this much malt upfront. After that theres citrus but not really like thw nose. Slight lemon pucker some sweeter stuff comes through but stays more along the bitter end. Nothing over the top bit extrenely well balanced 
M- medium mouthfeel that has lots of carbonation. Relatively dry finish.
O- good stuff. The smell was unbelievable and tasts although wasnt anything like the nose was still good. 748 charactersGushue3, Sep 24, 2011

A: Pours a orange color with a one finger off-white head with decent retention. Little bits of sticky lacing form on the sides of the glass. 
S: Extremely aromatic. There is a massive citrus/tropical fruit explosion in the aroma. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, and a bit of guava even. A bit of pine is mixed in as well as some faint graham cracker malt. Extremely fresh. 
T: Certainly citrusy, with some grapefruit, pineapple, and a bit of orange. It does not taste as fresh or come off as tropical as the aroma did, though I wish it did. Very hop forward for an APA, which I am a fan of. 
M: Medium bodied, a bit of the thick side for an APA, but drinks smooth and crisp. 
O: A very nice beer, but I think I like Alpha King more. I definitely want to give this beer another go though and would love to drink them side by side.

I have had this beer three time, this being my first bottle experience, and it has not disappointed once. This beer might not top my favorite list, but boy does it smell like my former favorite beer (Founders Harvest Ale pre-2010 batches). 
A: Pretty much as expected here for an American Pale. No too much head. Orangy golden straw color.
S: Enough of the looks, this is where this beer flies off the charts. Gorgeous, explosive citrus. The nose alone makes me think I've just got my daily allotment of Vitamin C.
T: Not as phenomenal as the smell, but it's hard to compete. This is a pretty damn tasty beer. A little more malt is present than I was expecting. Not super bitter, but a little reminiscent of slightly backed off version of Alpha King.
M: Not heavy at all, but a good amount of body here for the style. Still finishes clean. So refreshing. 
O: You want this beer. 
Give me this, Oracle and 2009 Founders Harvest Ale every day, please. 1,067 charactersmystikyle71, Sep 23, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Pours a dull, orangey-straw color with a perfect creamy two finger head with fair retention. Lacing is sticky and hangs around random streaks are hanging around for the duration. Looks great in a stone levitation glass.
S - The hops smell so incredibly fresh - bright lemon, sharp grass and a nice combination of grapefruit and pine. The malt (cracker) sweetness is peeking through ever so slightly. The aroma overall is not big, but it does smell fantastic. 
T - Opens with some tasty fresh citrus - lemon, orange, a little pineapple, then hits with some light caramel and bread malt action. The hop profile finishes with a low, but steady amount of pine, dank grass and grapefruit. It's reasonably bitter for a pale ale and drinks like one; I'm not assuming this is an ipa like I did with my first Alpha King. Strong where it needs to be and subtle where it needs to be; well done.
M - perfect. The body is substantial and satisfying. I'm borrowing "pillowy" from Cavery's review below; astute observation, my friend. The carbonation is incredibly crisp without shadowing flavors. 
O - This will be my regular drinker. I'm a huge fan of pale ales and this one tastes wonderful, drinks easily and doesn't overwhelm the palate. 1,235 charactersdrewba, Sep 23, 2011

Big pine hops are the first aroma, then citrus, mangoes, peaches, then sweet pineapple. Smells juicy and promising.
A juicy tart taste. Pine and grass are equally present with citrus hops and fruity sweetness. Very sweet and refreshing. Great balance of tart and sweet. Interesting to have so many pine/grass hops with such lush tropical fruit flavor.
Denser than it seems from the sweet taste. Leaves a great sticky film in my mouth. 506 charactersbirderbeerer, Sep 23, 2011

Aroma: Blood orange sorbet. Citrus smell just explodes from the glass. Very slight bit of breadiness and not much pine. This is a blood orange, ripe pineapple bomb!
Taste: expertly balanced. The malty sweetness and the hop bitterness are so well balanced here. You really get the fruity, juicy hops. No alcohol. Slightly bitter, crisp finish.
Mouthfeel: Light/Medium body. Just a perfect amount of carbonation. 
Overall: Wow. I literally could drink this beer all day, every day. Three Floyd's never disappoints. This one is just so drinkable. Perfect beer for warm weather. One of the best beers I've ever had. 731 characterskdmcguire10, Sep 23, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Fresh bottle sent to me by SpdKilz, big thanks for this surprise. After having had Hoppy Birthday, I can't help but want to put that up against another top notch APA. Onto the review!
A: Pretty looking amber caramel with some slightly off white coffee cream foams. Lacing up and down the glass is as thick as a jungle. Sticky spiderwebs hatch the circular interior of the glass. 
S: Smells almost like a resinous grassy gummy. Some unusual tropical fruits that burst with a fresh but not-quite-ripe greenness. It's like going through an orchard just before picking season. A tropical fruit cocktail of the more unusual variety. Light guava, passion fruit, and prickly pear. Thick pulpy melons at the rind. This really does make me think of cactus fruits. 
T: Crisp pineapple cores, melon flesh at the rind, and a smoothie of passion fruit with edible flowers/grasses. Man what SUPREME flavor, just amazingly juicy hop forward flavor with a soft mellow green melon bitterness. The balance on this thing is so phenomenal, unbelievable flavor in here. This seeps juiciness out of my pores, unique tropical gummy flavors that instantly make this a tip-top flavor performance. resinous but with notes of pure tropical purees. 
M: Soft cushioned pillow of a medium-light feel that's just spot on for the flavors. When I have this in my mouth, I believe that there is some pulpy tropical goodness wading midst the beer. An ultra fancy bitterness that primes the palate to perceive fruity textures and flavors. 100% pure flavor inception in the mouth. 
O: I always try to make sure I don't gush on a beer when I try to give it a review, but this one really just makes me happy. I always want to leave room for another beer to come along and blow me out of the water, but you also have to pay your respects when you have a beer that does just that. This one has rocked me to the core, and I can't believe what a sensory experience this is. It's a Pale ale with an infectious personality, and I can see why this would be called zombie dust. If i had enough of it with me, I'd drink this till I was a zombie myself. Put this on your wants, and get a full pack. I have to admit, I think this is better than Hoppy birthday -- sorry Alpine. It's the juiciness, I still love the pine nutty malt on hoppy birthday, but damn this juiciness. 2,328 charactersCavery, Sep 22, 2011

a: deep gold w/orange highlights with a thick, persistent white head and lush lacing coating the glass.
s: citra hop aromas explode out of the glass-a bigger nose than most DIPAs. lemons and tropical fruit come to mind. pale malts in the background. aroma is far better than i can do justice to. i could just smell this all day long.
t: superbly balanced between the light to medium doughy/honey-like malt sweetness and the big, smooth hop bitterness. the thing that stands out the most is how juicy and fruity the hops are mid-palate. more juicy hops even than broodoo, hopslam, etc. loving the citra. hops get a slight grassy/resiny aspect in the finish. finishes dryish and clean with lingering juicy hop flavors. the malt/hop balance in this is impeccable. each sips begs another. 
m: medium-bodied and softly carbed.
o: this can satisfy as a warm weather 'having a few' beer, or as a sipper-the flavors are much bigger than the abv would suggest. this is the only beer (gumball is close) that i can just drink over and over and over and not tire of it...it's all i want to drink and i have been struggling to consume some of the other standbys in my beer fridge. 1,549 charactersMrMcGibblets, Sep 22, 2011

A: Bright to dark orange, depending on how the light hits it. Almost one finger, slightly off white head, with great retention and beautiful lacing.
S: Wow. Big citrus hops. Just a combo of everything at once. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange, tangerine, mango, apricot, you name it. Light floral, earthy, and piney hops coming through also. Just the faintest hint of a malt backbone... this is one spineless beer!!
T: Not much sweetness upfront, just a touch. The hops come through in every form. Citrus, earthy, floral, and pine mix and mingle with class. None taking anything from the other. Just the slightest hint of bitterness, but also not really sweet either. Weird how hops and malts cancel each other out and just let flavors shine through.
M: Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Probably the driest beer I've ever had. Great mouth coating.
O: All I can say is WOW! Blown away. Easily the Best Pale Ale I've had. It's like an IPA with out the bitterness or sweetness. Hops shine through without wrecking your palate. Truly an amazing well crafted beer! 1,158 charactersdoughanson78, Sep 22, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to hawks10 for this delicious bit of 3rd coast hop artistry
Pours a cloudy golden with a finger of white head that takes a dive down to a lasting skim. Some righteous lace arms hug my tulip.
Smell is a medium aroma featuring C-hops for sure, beautiful tropical and citrus, some nice neutral sweet. even some floral notes and a beautiful balance to it. As it warms some lemon rises into the nose as I drink a sip.
Wonderful taste, beautiful presentation of tropical fruit/citrus hops and tasteful bittering on a blanket of light sweet that is just grainy enough to give the flavors a great showing. It has a very blended taste, nicely balanced despite being almost completely hop driven. It's a balance of the many delicious flavors I find in the hop profile that gives this beer its appeal. The sip ends with some very tasteful bitter rising up to dry the sip perfectly.
For style this is at the upper limit of viscosity, but has beautifully low carb., and a finish that could easily define this style. 
One day I hope to brew the equal of this beer. Until then we have Zombie Dust from FFF to drink. Get this if you can, it is staggeringly delicious. 1,167 characterscavedave, Sep 21, 2011

S: i had just barely cracked the seal on the cap of this bottle and i could already smell the great citrus hop aroma, so strong and sweet, just a great smelling brew, honestly might be the best smelling beer i have ever had, citrus hops but they're backed by something else that just gives it such depth and resonance, perfect
T: great hop taste, not too sweet nor to strong and citrusy, great depth, before the citrus backs out something a bit funkier that i think is reminiscent of peaches works its way in that gives it great depth and really helps it to finish smoothly
M: medium carbonation that backs out and slides away gently, smooth through the middle, leaves the mouth....dry and yet somehow wet and salivating, really interesting here
O: really the most complex and delicious Pale ale I've ever had, not too hopped, heavy, or malty, just balance in its purest sense. i need to get my hands on a case of this stuff 1,125 charactersBigPlay1824, Sep 21, 2011

Start to finish in the aroma this one is full of grapefruit and citrus hops. Pretty much straight shooter on the aroma; just slightly bitter with tons of citrus. The taste is much like the aroma, lots of citrus grassy hops with some grapefruit being the most noticable of fruits. Finish with dry and bitter.
The body is light and the carbonation is good. Like I previously stated, a little dry on the finish. Overall great stuff. About as good as hoppy pale ales get. 668 charactersBendurgin, Sep 20, 2011

The beer is light, well carbed, and prickly feeling with a dry bitter finish that lingers, presenting huge citrusy grapefruit notes in the process. 
The clear, dark golden body sits beneath a three finger frothy cap and looks stunning. Amazing retention and gorgeous lacing are the proverbial cherry on top. 
The nose holds faint dry malts and ginormous citrusy hops; oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, etc. The beer tastes fantastic-- American pales are my top drinking style of beer, my go to daily drinker, and this is easily amongst the finest made. I can, and will, drink the hell out of this beer.

I've seen that this beer has been getting a lot of buzz lately, let's see what all the fuss is about...
Pours a hazy gold color with a pretty nice white head.
Aromas are phenomenal, this is easily one of the best beers I have smelt in quite a while. Really floral, with a bunch of citrus notes, some orange, tangerine, peaches, mangos, and also a touch of stinky resin.
Taste is a bit of a let down, but I have to say, that is mostly because this beer smells so good, not because it tastes bad. Soft creamy malts, light cream and bread up front. The beer then settles into some light citrus bitterness, some lemon, oranges, and hard candies. 
Mouthfeel is good, full, and smooth with nice carbonation.
Overall, this is an excellent pale ale. Like I said, the taste didn't quite live up to the nose, but that's mostly because this is such a nice smelling beer. Well done 3 Floyds, I actually prefer this to Dreadnaught. 968 charactersflexabull, Sep 19, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle generously donated by Bendurgin. Thanks! Poured into a tapered pint glass. The color is light straw and hazy. The head is poured with about a quarter inch of white foam.
The aroma is full of spicy hops with a dash of citrus.
The taste has honeydew and cucumber, with a nice bitter piney finish.
The mouthfeel is light with some nice crisp carbonation.
Huge fan of this very hoppy, very drinkable pale ale. 416 charactersandrewinski1, Sep 18, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Thank you homebrew311, this is truly a gem of a beer. 
A – Beautiful golden color, a little on the lighter side. Nice fluffy white head that dissipated pretty quickly. Leaves a nice lacing on the sides of the glass. 
S – HOPS, and I mean HOPS, its right in your face from the start. The hop gives you a nice amount of grapefruit, pineapple and citrus, malt doesn’t want to come to the party in the nose. 
T – Citrus primarily grapefruit, also some pineapple and a small amount of pine resin, but this is a HOP BOMB and there is a great bitterness to this beer. I can’t speak for the malt, because they didn’t seem present. 
M – Perfect balance of carbonation, this is awesomely balanced brew not to thick and not to thin. 
O – I think this is the best beer of the year, or one of the highest I have ranked this year. I wish this was distributed into my market or I could obtain a keg of this stuff because I would only drink this. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking some up. 1,010 charactersMrTopher, Sep 18, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Clear pale-orange body. Large white head upon initial pour. Quickly receded. Moderate amount of sudsy lacing left on the glass.
S: Bright grapefruit, orange, pineapple and just a tad bit of resinous pine. Assertive tropical fruit blast -- reminiscent of fresh Sculpin.
T: Like biting into a fresh grapefruit -- with almost none of the bitterness. Amazing tropical fruit component that shines in a fresh, vibrant way, but not super-bitter like most IPAs/dIPAs that pack this much flavor per sip.
M: Smooth, medium bodied, with assertive carbonation (but not over-carbonated). Refreshing, clean finish.
O: A wonderful "APA." Like Alpha King, its hard to call this "just" an APA, but whatever it is, its damn tasty. Speaking of Alpha King, I'd love to try this head to head with fresh Alpha King. 800 characterscallmemickey, Sep 18, 2011

S - Hops, citrus, very lively. Not overwhelming per se but just nice and light. 
T - Citrus without overwhelming sweetness. It is sweet but I just didn't get overwhelmed with it. Lots of hops and some bitterness at the end. 
M - Nice lightness with moderate carbonation. Very crisp and lively. 
O - I'm trying to not go overboard but this might become one of my favorites. I was fairly impressed with this. Time may weather my opinion but right now I highly recommend this. 575 charactersmpcrump, Sep 18, 2011

Smell - lots of tropical fruit, oranges, pineapple, and tangerines. some wheatlike and grain characteristics. Hops are very pleasant to the nose 
Taste - Follows the nose really well, tons of tropical fruits. oranges, pineapple and GRAPEFRUIT. HUGE GRAPEFRUIT!! It has a crazy aftertaste like a i had a glass of grapefruit juice. very well done. Hops play very well with the grains in this one. 
Overall - worth that hype and man do i love this aftertaste of grapefruit. Its very refreshing and easy to drink. 606 charactersbadboyrsl84, Sep 17, 2011

S-piney citra hoop aroma, super heavy hop aroma, enough to make me salivate. I could sit around and smell this beer, for hours on end.
T: Sweet citrus hop profile is prominent. Malts are light but help in the sweetness. This is all about the hops as are many 3F beers. A fantastic and drinkable pale, not a session beer but close.
M-good body given the profile of the beer. Smooth mouthfeel, easy to drink.
O: very tasty, the hops are the main attraction. But are mellowed by the wheat and malt profile. One of my favorite beers. 566 charactersonefmatt, Sep 17, 2011

an onslaught of tropical fruit and citrus. lots of mango, peach, tangerine, grapefruit, etc.. very dominating through out. malt presence is weak and i mean that in a good way

Appearance: Mostly clear dark golden with two fingers of fluffy white head that hung around for a couple of minutes.
Smell: Very nice aroma on this. A lot of musty hop aroma from the citra hops mixed with tropical fruit (mango, tangerine) and bitter tart grapefruit. Very in your face. 
Taste: Getting the tropical fruits from the aroma in the taste of this, sweet without being overly sweet and the hops are not overpowering in the taste, with a bitter, somewhat earthy taste.
Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied. Very, very smooth.
Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, much like most of what I've had from Three Floyds. I will be seeking this out again. 732 charactersAxic10, Sep 17, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -7.7%look: 2 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to claaark13 for this one. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Heady Topper pint glass. Shared with schen9303. 
Pours a 1 finger frothy white head with low retention. Beer is a cloudy pale copper-peach. Lacing is spotty and stringy with moderate stick. Lower than average due to lack of head retention, clarity, and sparse lacing. 
Nose is peach and papaya. Very robust and fruity with a great pulpy character. Citrus hop aromas linger in the foreground but don’t dominate the experience. Very nice. 
Opens orange, lemon, papaya, and peach. Great sweetness with a nice balance of citrus hop bitterness in the background. Cane sugar and more papaya towards the middle. End is more fruit and citrus hop notes. Finish is a fruit bouquet with a lingering hop bitter finish. Really solid and surprisingly complex for an APA. 
Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Bubbly, crisp, and refreshing in the mouth and light and spritzy going down. Finish is quiet with a lingering, filmy aftertaste. Very quaffable and easy to drink. 
I originally wanted this beer for the kickass artwork but after getting my hands on it, I think this might just be one of the best all-around pale ales I’ve ever had. Refreshing, complex, and very drinkable, it has everything you’d ever want from the style. 1,298 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 17, 2011

Super Fresh! So pumped!
A- Pours a beautiful light orange with less than a finger head but you wouldn't believe it due to the lacing it leaves. Tons of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. 
S- Wow. Tons of resin and dankness, sweet orange, tropical fruits, tangerine, citrus, and a good combo of grassy notes. It's hard to get past the hops in this one but there is some sweetness from the caramel toffee of the malts. Smells like what 3 Floyds knows how to do best, overly super hop a beer! Amazing. 
T- Super bitter hops up front with a nice bready sweet caramel background. Tons of flavors coming from the hops like mentioned in the aroma, that FFF standard flavor. Resin and Dank grass, oranges, pineapple, citrus, and other exotic tropical fruits. Sweet caramel malts come through quite a bit and create a nice body for the beer and base for the hops to mix with. Really awesome APA no doubt. Matters well be an IPA. Or DIPA with all these hops.
M- Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a nice strong bitter finish. 
Overall this stuff is off the chain good. If you can get it, get it.

A. Pours a somewhat murky yellow orange with a two finger creamy off-white head that dissipates leaving some residual lacing.
S. Lemon zest, subtle orange, lemongrass - a nice herbal lemony scent, and a nice subtle malty sweetness.
T. Grapefruit is the most apparent flavor on the tongue with some lemon and a biscuit malty sweetness.
M. Fairly thick and creamy for a brew like this.
D. I enjoyed this beer, but not quite as much as my another Chicago-area pale ale - the supreme reign of Daisy Cutter continues. (It's a shame too since I'll be able to pick this up locally.) 607 charactersBeerAndBourbon, Sep 16, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to SpdKilz for a couple sixers of this delicious nectar. Bottled ~2-3 weeks ago. Enjoyed on 09/15/11.
A - Pours just slightly hazy bright orange color with a one finger white head. Leaves very nice lacing around the sides.
S - Whoa, this is going to be good. Classic FFF pale ale aroma. HUGE citrus aroma on this one, these Citra hops are really the star. Some sweet malt in the background, but it smells like a freshly sliced orange with a hint of grapefruit.
T - Absolutely perfect on the taste. It's like a more balanced, APA version of Kern River Citra. Very nice sticky sweet malts are present throughout with a pleasant bitterness up front. Then through the middle is a big punch of citrus and grapefruit flavors. Finishes balanced with a very nice, clean, bitter, hop flavor on the tongue. Great stuff.
M - Mouthfeel is excellent. Medium bodied, pretty low carbonation for an IPA which helps leave the hop flavor on the tongue for just long enough.
O - Overall, this is my favorite APA I've had. Big and flavorful, yet easy to drink. A+ 1,059 charactersJanderson91, Sep 15, 2011

The appearance is a cloudy light gold color with a small but noticeable head that went away quickly. The smell is out of this world, reminds me of Gumball Head on steroids. The same fruity notes come out in both with this i get more floral tones than with the Gumball Head but very similar. Once I got past the formalities and actually got to taste it what I got in the smell carried over to the taste as far as it being similar to Gumball Head. This beer to me is a heavier more tasty version it. I enjoy drinking this and could see myself drinking multiple of these. This has a very good mouthfeel and is very pleasant to drink. Overall this is my 2nd favorite FFF beer but that puts it into the top 10 of all beers. 816 charactersTheTot, Sep 14, 2011
3.83/5  rDev -15.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412 oz bottle, courtesy Chicago BAs, poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours hazy golden with a thick off white head. Good retention and lacing.
 One of the better smelling APAs out there, this one has me convinced that Chicagoland brews the best APAs, with the possible exception of Alpine. Never had Hoppy Birthday. Grassy and weedy as promised with some malt sugars coming forth in the aroma.
 Taste is fairly simple with both, flavor and bitterness, on a decent malt backbone. More dry hopped than bittered methinks. Initially it seemed very easy drinking and quenching but the body is pretty decent, with good, but not crisp carbonation. I like it, but I still think that the ABV could have been lower.

A: a slightly cloudy golden brown (think golden teddy grahams) with a thick - and I mean THICK - creamy white head, about 1/2 an inch thick, and it is staying. the head's not going anywhere. even more, it looks slightly bulbous as if there is yeast still eating away... needless to say, it is both amusing and slightly unsettling.
S: clean hops of a candied grapefruit variety, a mixture of sweet and bitter.
T: delicious. this is delicious. the hops are front and center, similar to the smell - candied grapefruit fading into a taste I can't quite place... it is something from my childhood, maybe a flavor in fruitloops? the taste is very clean with a slightly mellow edge, i could down quite a few of these.
M: only a bit residual, this beer has a clean but not exactly crisp quality to it that lets me feel as if i am simultaneously drinking a strong APA and working through a slight malt body.
Overall I am in love - this may be a new go-to on hot days, and certainly is a step above Alpha King. blasphemous? go try it out. i can't wait for the bottles to appear! 1,106 charactersfvernon, Sep 13, 2011

Pours a cloudy pale orange with huge amounts of foamy off-white head. The enormous cap of head sticks around forever, leaving chunks of lacing behind...
Powerful aromas of bright and juicy tropical fruit, sweet, very nice...
Tastes as sweet as it smells, big juicy tropical hops explode on the palette, a slight bitterness hits at the end and slowly builds into a full presence. Smooth and creamy feel, but could probably be a bit more lively in the mouth. Overall a fantastic APA, but I still think I would take Daisy Cutter over it most days of the week... 684 charactershawks10, Sep 13, 2011

Served in New Belgium globe glass
A: Pours clear gold with two-inch head that hangs around for a couple moments and then recedes leaving nice lacing. Medium effervescence. 
S: Ton of citrus fruit: grapefruit, lemon and orange. Distinct aroma of cat pee. Additional aromas include citrus peels and crushed white grapes. 
T: Incredibly, taste builds on smell, with citrus, especially lemons, becoming more intense. Medium bitterness steps in, inviting another drink. Relatively clean finish with lemony edge.  Other than a slight note of tea, malts are nowhere to be found. 
M: Medium to medium-light body and medium carbonation. Silky mouthfeel resulting from blanket of tight bubbles. 
O: Three Floyds packs a west coast style IPA featuring the delicious Citra hop in a pale ale package. Big flavor and low abv always rates well with me.  938 charactersWadsey, Sep 11, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Picked up a couple cases from the FFF brewpub ($30/cs bot, $10/6-pack)
Zombie Dust, bottled, is paler in color than I remember from the growler, with just a little bit of carbonation that yields a soft white head that leaves sparce lacing.
This beer smells glorious! Like the freshest hop aroma I've ever smelled in a beer. It's like crushing green Centennial hop cones. The grapefruit rind is the dominant aroma, with hints of sweet, tropical mango and papaya. This is just a fantastic smelling beer.
The beer is very hop-forward with good sticky, resinous hop flavors that also has crisp lemony tang. The bitterness is very clean and not overpowering. It's amazing to get such a tasty, complex hop profile from just a varietal. The kiss of sweet malt is just there to make the fruity flavors taste just sweet enough.
Carbonation is a bit lower than I would've liked, but this beer is the best APA, I've ever had, probably because it's a great IPA marketed as an APA. Considerably better than HF Citra and KR Citra imo, I've sampled both fresh from a just tapped keg and opened growler. Could not recommend this beer more! 1,127 charactersSoonami, Sep 11, 2011

A, consistent with most all quality apas. Clear, golden, nice one finger head with light lacing in the glass.
S, one of the best parts of this beer. Amazing citrusy nose. If youre familiar with 3 floyds youll recognize this smell.
T, 3 floyds best apa yet. The hop flavor and bitterness are perfectly balanced and the malt takes shape at just the right moment. Almost a dreadnaught light.
M, very good. Suits the beer pefectly and lingers on your tongue just the right amount of time.
Get it as soon as you can. This is one outstanding apa. 557 charactersjthahn, Sep 11, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle given to me by backfat. Poured into my Unibroue Maudite Snifter.
Appearance: Pours a crystal clear, yellow-orange color. Fat inch of off-white foam that reluctantly recedes to a thin layer of teeny bubbles. Incredible lacing sticking to my glass, as if parts of this beer are too good to be consumed. Brilliant.
Smell: Citrus fruitiness wofting out of the bottle pre-pour, and just intensifies once it is in the glass. Inviting aromas of Grapefruit rind and Pineapple erupting from my snifter. Hint of malt hiding in there as well, but this beauty is leaning heavily towards the hoppy side. 
Taste: Starts out like I'm chewing on a healthy chunk of fresh grapefruit. A quick flash of sweet maltiness dances across my tongue, and then my tasters are consumed by more resiny hops. The taste of citrus rinds has the final dance here, lingering on my tongue and the back of my mouth for a good long time. 
Mouthfeel: Light and airy, with a velvetine smoothness that is breathtaking. Phenominal.
Overall: I must start by saying that I am not a big fan of the "HypeTrain." Time and time again, I am let down because I let Hype tell me that "x" beer will be insanely amazing. This beer lives up to the hype. Easily. I think Three Floyds raised the bar on this style for sure. Definitely gotta grab some of this if you are given the chance. This beer is absolutely fantastic. 1,379 charactersnewrbrewr, Sep 10, 2011

T- Very similar to nose, sweet caramel malts and perfect amount of citrus hops to balance the malt and leave a nice bitterness.
M- Medium to light bodied. Nice creaminess with lighter carbonation. Very easy to drink.
O- Probably the best pale ale I have ever had! Could easily drink a 6 pack of this in a night or day, which I never do. Very easy drinking crisp beer to enjoy frequently. 565 characterskawilliams81, Sep 09, 2011

This beer, for me, sets the new standard for a hoppy APA. The citra hops are completely enveloping, both in aroma and taste. Unlike a comparable IPA, however, you can have a couple of these without feeling like you're starting to over do it. This beer blows the doors off of pretty much any APA I've ever had, and even rivals some IPAs. A fantastically drinkable beer that I think will give Gumballhead a run for it's money. Look out Alpha King, this Zombie is gonna eat your brains, and then crap them out on your throne!!

4.77/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Serving Type : 12oz bottle poured into a 8oz tasting glass. Just picked up a case today at FFF so I'm sure it's super fresh.
Appearance : straw yellow in color. A nice foamy head forms after a vigorous pour. Head has medium retention and fades away leaving a white ring behind and some lacing.
Smell : strong sweet piney evergreen aromas abound. This is what I really appreciate about this beer. Best nose ever for this style that I have come across. 
Taste : Big bold flavors here that linger on you palette . Tons of citrus and pine . Not alot of bitterness for my taste I'm going with 50 IBUs but I like to scorch my taste buds with 100 IBU beer routinely. If this beer had a tad more bitterness I would give it a 5.
Mouthfeel : light to medium body with medium carbonation
Overall : this is my favorite beer to date. Easy to drink and big in flavor. Lots of hoppy goodness and IMO subtle hop bitterness . A beer drinkers beer. I'm so glad they finally bottled this beer and can enjoy it 12oz at a time instead of trying to smash a growler in one night. 1,061 charactersBUNZILLA, Sep 07, 2011

Pours slightly cloudy golden yellow, small pale head. Smell is delicious, very citrusy, very floral, very appealing, very strong.
Taste has a lot of straw, a lot more of the citrus, honeysuckle sweetness, the hops are there but doesn't seem like it's super bitter. This is really nice.

A: At first glance looks awesome with a great color. Poured with a great head with lacing that hangs around.
S: In one word... heavenly. If they made car fresheners with this id buy the whole stock.
T: I'm a few sips in and I feel like this will be one of my favorite beers when it comes out bottled. The citra hops just make this thing so damn enjoyable I can't hardly stand it.
M: solid once again. Not too overbearing and easy to drink
Overall: I don't think I can really do this beer justice. Possibly one of my favorite beers of all time and just one I could put down every single day and be happy to do it. 721 charactersShagtastic, Sep 06, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Clear orange body with a nice stiff white head. 
Tangerine and fruit punch mixed with some heady in the aroma. Damn this smells good. Thankfully the taste delivers. I was scared that the 50 IBUs as listed wouldn't be enough but this beer came through with the citra hop flavor. Lots of dank bitterness and more tangerine flavor. Closing in on Hill Farmstead status but a little unrestrained and wild which is FFF style. 
This is the best beer I've had from 3 Floyd's. The major problem I have with this beer is that it's very high in alcohol for a pale ale. The taste totally works but for what it's labeled as I want that sessionability and the abv is just too high. Comes through just a little bit in the taste too. I have to knock it in the overall points because of that. 777 charactersBearsOnAcid, Sep 02, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to malty who lugged this from the brewery to our cooler at the Great Taste of the Midwest, from whence it traveled back to the Twin Cities. Now, finally, two weeks later, we get a chance to crack it open after I forgot to bring it to a tasting (doh!). 
Cap twists off with a soft but satisfying hiss: carbonation intact! Pour is clear pale yellow with mild revving carbonation & a head that proves the beer still lives. Smell leans heavily on the hops, citrus on the fruit plate mingled with all manner of tropics. All hop, no malt. OK by me. 
Zombie Dust stomps all over the chalk outline delineating India Pale Ale from American Pale Ale. This beer is all about the hops. There is still a pale malt character underneath, but it's second fiddle. The hop flavors are lovely: plenty of pine, citrus, pineapple, with a follow-up nip of bitterness that's aggressive enough to chew my palate up. Not sure if it's the malting or not, but this gives off a lighter 'feel' that your typical IPA, & goes down like cool water. Tasty cool water. If this came out of drinking fountains...oh, sorry. Almost got lost in my fantasty world. 
Not quite the life-altering experience I'd hoped for, but easily one of the top five pales ales I've ever had, clearly behind only its brewery-mate Alpha King. Excellent beer. This is going to be a good evening. 1,351 charactersmaximum12, Aug 28, 2011

A: clear gold, thin white head to start, not much hanging around, decent lacing
S: citra hop heaven! Juicy grapefruit,papaya, mango,and peach come through. All fruit, not getting any malts, but that's okay because this smells amazing.
T: bright fruity hops, peach and mango return with a bit of a bitterness towards the end, a slight touch of pine along with fair amount of bread and caramel on the finish. Impeccable balance. 
Mf: light carb, light bodied.
O: delicious. Best APA I've tried to date. Can't wait to see this in 6 packs! 571 charactershomebrew311, Aug 27, 2011

4.55/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Finally got to have a couple of pints at the Tomlinson tap room. I've been looking forward to this one! Firstly, it's a beautiful beer. Orange-amber color with a good, whitish head. The aroma could only be better if there were more of it. Awesome citra hop, juicy, grapefruit goodness. The flavor has some caramel malt early, then the juicy hop flavor and finally a dry, slightly bitter finish. I wish it was just a touch smoother, but it's so good as is. Mouthful is nice. Overall, one the best I've had in quite a while. Lives up to my expectations. 551 charactersAaronHomoya, Aug 26, 2011

A - dark golden with a monster frothy head. Awesome lacing
S - tons of fruit (mango, peach) and pine. Slightly dank in the background. This is just am awesome bouquet of aromas I want to smell all day.
T - nice sweetness then an awesome piney butter finish. Lots of earthy notes on the finish
M - solid body and light carb. Little oily on the finish
O - just a ridiculously awesome apa. Super drinkable and tons of flavor. This is even better than I expected. Possibly the best apa I've ever had. 518 charactersChrisPro, Aug 25, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a standard pale color - golden yellow with a large foamy white head. Lacing is solid. 
The aroma is detectable once it was placed in front of me even though it was 1 foot away. Tropicle pineapple, mango, with some pine notes.
Tropical heaven with tons of hop presence without a lot of bitterness. They must have loads of late addition hops in the brewing process. The malt backbone is a wonderful compliment to the hop bouquet.
Medium full mouthfeel.
This is a wonderful APA. I would love to settle down to a 6 pack of this as the drinkability is great. 563 charactersTCgoalie, Aug 23, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Growler poured into a Duvel tulip.
Golden yellow with a nice white head. 
Smells fantastic. Tropical fruit notes, a little dank resiny hop aroma, a hint of pineapple like sweetness. The description here for this says this beer showcases Citra hops and that is no lie.
Taste follows the aroma. Big tropical fruit flavors, pineapple, grassy hop notes but then at the finish is this nice pale malt backbone. Not really bitter but this is an APA not an IPA so it really works for the style. A really easy to drink beer. I could put away gallons of this if given the opportunity.
medium bodied, a light carbonation, probably would be better on tap than in a growler as far as mouthfeel goes but still is fine the way it is.
I really really like this beer. I can easily say this is the best pale ale I've ever had. The flavor is simply phenomenal. If you have a chance to try this then go for it you will not regret it. 917 charactersjpmclaug, Aug 21, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Enjoyed as one of my first beers of DLD. 
Pours a nice orange color with white a white head. Simple but effective. You bring this beer near you and you get huge orangey hop smell. One dimensional in a fantastic way. The taste is huge orange hop flavor with a medium bitterness. Holy cow, this is fantastic if you like citra. The malts are there for only the smallest amount of balance and the citra hop gives off other, much smaller tropical fruit notes. Again, simple, but effective. Better than Daisy Cutter and equal to Hoppy Birthday, where hoppy birthday has less malt balance and a different type of hop flavor (pine). Good body and good carbonation. Wow, this is fantastic. Hopefully it holds up when they bottle it in the same way it comes off from the tap. Tied for the best APA I've ever had and lightyears past a local throwaway APA. 845 charactersseeswo, Aug 20, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Deuane for picking me up a growler of this one during his recent trip through the brewpub.
A - Pours slightly hazed golden orange with a nice one finger tall white head leaving 
S - HUGE amounts of grapefruit throughout this one. Tons of oily citra hops dominate the nose with a bit of lightly toasted sweet caramel malt hiding in the shadows. The second we cracked this growler I could smell it from across the room.
T - Starts off with a huge, oily, citric hop bite quickly giving way to a mix of strong tropical fruits like grapefruits, pineapple, and oranges. Once the hop resins die down you get a bit of the chewy, lightly toasted, caramel malt but this one really is all about the hops. The alcohol is nearly undetectable, only coming through at the very end of each glass. The finish is a mix of citric hop oils and some light chewiness, lingering for some time.
M - Medium-Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Lots of hop oils and some light chewiness in the feel, lingering through the finish. Even with all these hops it remains quite light.
O - Well that growler disappeared pretty damn quick. I could drink this one all day, every day, it is that good. The citra hops are the perfect choice for this beer and this is easily one of the best hop-forward pale ales I have ever had. 1,322 charactersorangesol, Aug 18, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to brewslut for delivering a growler of this from the FFF brewpub. Several Imperial pints poured and consumed on 8/16/11.
A - Poured a slightly hazy amber/orange liquid with traces of slow-rising carbonation bubbles and a finger's worth of foamy white head that receded to a thin, wispy retention and deposited a sticky smattering of lace around the glass.
S - Whoa! Tropical fruit galore with citrus notes not too far behind. Malt character is sweet with hints of caramel and toasted grains. Possibly the freshest, hoppiest pale ale I've ever smelled!
T - Flavor is dripping with hop nectar - tropical fruit and citrus at the forefront, as well as traces of grass, faint catbox and leafy hops. Complex hop profile to say the least. Sweet and grainy malt balances things out, especially in the backend, resulting in an extremely well-balanced pale ale that retains amazing hop character. 
M - Light to medium bodied with a very oily texture and minimal carbonation. Lots of hop oils in this sucker! Finishes with a light lingering bitterness on the palate.
D - Ridiculously drinkable, insanely balanced pale ale... perhaps the best straight-up pale ale I've ever had. Amazing. Reminds me of Alpine's Nelson. 1,219 charactersffejherb, Aug 17, 2011

Bartender pours beer into nonic pint glass.
Appearance: glowing yellow golden colored beer. White head with great lacing clings to pint glass!
Smell: Smells of fresh citrus and light bready/biscuit malt.
Taste: Mild hop bitterness that is all citris. This beer is fresh and tastey! Citris notes of huge oranges. These hops taste super fresh.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied thats at the far end of the spectrum; almost medium bodied. Medium levels of carbonation thats near perfect. Really drinkable.
Overall: great session beer if you love citrusy hops. Went down way too easy! Great value when you can grab a case for $35 at 3 Floyds. 696 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 15, 2011

A- Cloudy orange body with a large, fluffy head that sticks around for a bit. Leaves lots of lacing throughout the glass as you drink it.
S- Phenomenal. The star of this is the loads of tropical fruit that overwhelm your senses. Can't get enough of this.
T- Juicy, tropical fruit hit first followed by a slight touch of bitterness that gives the beer a crisp, clean finish. Faint, underlying citrus notes. Lots of fruity hop flavor balanced perfectly by some sweet malts. Very refreshing and easy to drink. 
M- Medium body with decent carbonation. FFF are usually spot on with the mouthfeel of their ales and this is no exception. 
O- This is an elite APA. Tons of tropical hop flavor delivered from those amazing citra hops balanced perfectly by the malts. Very refreshing, easy to drink, smells/tastes great...what more do you want? Dedicated my avatar to this beer, cannot wait until they bottle it! 1,019 charactersSimmy7000, Aug 13, 2011

A: Light orange, mostly clear. Small amount (1 finger) of white head with great retention. Brief spotted lacing
S: Definitely citra hops in this one. Subtle grapefruit. Light underlying pine. As it warms, I start to detect just a little bit of scallion/onion, but it doesn't detract from the overall scent
T: Lots of citrus flavors, blended nicely. Doesn't have the big hop bitterness though. Juicy melon, orange, grapefruit. There is a touch of bitterness in the background, but again, not a dominating presence
M: Medium bodied. Appropriate amount of carbonation at first, but ends smooth. Lingering bitterness on the palate
D: Big hoppy pale ale. Super easy drinking, could sip on this all day. Just another reason why I wish I lived close to this brewery 810 charactersBrez07, Aug 13, 2011

A: Great off white head, good amount of lacing on this one. Very pleasing. Nice sun burnt orange color. 
S: WOW! Probably the best APA I've ever had the pleasure to whiff it's pleasurable aroma! You got tons of pine, grapefruit, and a really astringent-dank hoppiness to it. Incredible. 
T: Just as good as the smell, very exciting once you actually taste it. Incredibly drinkable and so over hopped it makes me want to shed a tear. This beer is no joke, GOOD! Incredibly piney with a nice sweetness to it that makes this beer Slammable. 
MF: Smooth as hell with medium carbonation. Very nice to say the least for this style and tast. 
Overall, I want more, all the time. Enough said. I can't wait until this bottles so I can avoid paying $24 for. Growler. Try this beer. 815 charactersGlassFreeek, Aug 10, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Chris for sharing his growler of this one.
A: Pours a cloudy orange/amber color, darker than I expected it to be.
S: Wow, what an incredible aroma! It's just tropical fruity hops hitting you in the face. It doesn't get much better than this.
T: Taste follows the smell and does not disappoint at all. Citrusy hops are definitely the dominant flavor, but the beer has a stronger malt backbone than I expected, which leads to some great balance. Very easy to drink and packs a TON of flavor.
M: Light-medium bodied, nice carbonation with some great hop stickiness and a little bit of dryness in the finish.
O: This is a hell of a beer, and fits right in with others like Alpine's Hoppy Birthday and The Alchemist's Holy Cow in the trend of low ABV, super hopped delicious pale ales/IPAs. It's so ridiculously easy to drink and flavorful. I can't wait for bottles, because this could so easily be my go-to beer for a long, long time. 949 charactersstarrdogg, Aug 10, 2011

Smells of grapefruit and lots of tropical fruits along with a nice malty sweetness.
Tastes is similar to the nose. I fall in love with this beer every time I have it. Loads of tropical fruits and grapefruit. Taste starts off a bit sweet rounding into a nice clean bitterness on the finish. Very well balanced beer as some malt presence is there, but the citrusy hops are the star of the palate.
Fairly light beer with a good carbonation level, but still a slight bit of stickiness.
One of the best pale ales I've ever had. I can't wait until they start bottling this. We got a growler to go and ended up finishing it in the hotel room. I could drink this beer all day. 736 charactersjmarsh123, Aug 09, 2011

 I get big hop floral smell right off the bat, orange and other fruits mixed in there as well, the most floral smelling pale ale to date for me.
WOW! Amazing candied fruits on front of pallet with a nice bitter ending down the throat. This is the hoppiest pale ale I have had and best in its class I must say, still need to try out Hoppy Birthday. 
Overall if I lived in Chicago 3 Floyds area I would be there every weekend getting some of this goodness. Hands down mastery of hops and malt balancing. Now I have killed my growler and am both happy to have had this and sad that will be awhile before I can quench this hole it has left in my heart :( 791 charactersMiloHoP, Aug 07, 2011

A: Pours a vibrant light amber with yellow hues intertwined. Nice pure white lace that subsides in a great frothy film. Wonderful webbed lacing followed me down the whole glass.
S: The brew popped. Big citrus notes with nice tropical fruits peaking though. Pineapple and mango give an idea of what these hops are giving off. Just a pleasant smelling in every way.
T: The first thing that hits my tongue is that nice fruity citrus blast. The makes way for some light grassy hops and then it finally settles on nice light caramel malt backbone. Amazingly balanced.
M: This is how a beer is supposed to feel. Light crispiness with a wonderfully balanced body. Medium carbonation. Leaves a a nice palate coating twinge of fruity goodness.
O: I waited a while to try this and I'm so happy it didn't let me down. Not only that, it completely blew me away and exceeded all expectations. A perfectly balanced beer and I can't wait until the bottling rumors become true. 1,030 charactersTreebs, Aug 07, 2011

LOL God DAMN what any experience. The moment I cracked the growler, I was amazed. This is the first beer I would describe as smelling "dank" in the pot aficionado manner of speaking. Poured a beautiful hazy orange with a rather meager head, which I attribute to the growler. The mouthfeel and taste are off the charts. This is easily one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had the good fortune of enjoying in all my beer drinking days. I can't wait for them to bottle this stuff.

Aroma is a lot like my homebrew pale ale. So I'm gunna say some cascade hops and centennial? Nice and citrusy. Nice malt aroma too.
Taste is great. Nice citrus hops and a nice malt flavor. Nice smooth hop flavor. Very tasty.
Lower on the carb side. I blame the growler but it's nice. Smooth.
Overall maybe the best pale ale I've had but it's not a revelation. I've had some beers that were a revelation and this one is just maybe the best of it's style. 646 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Aug 03, 2011

Served in a pint glass.
A: The beer arrives a golden orange color with killer clarity. There is a one finger white head with decent retention and lacing.
S: No question that citra is the culprit in the aroma. I am greeted by a monstrous wave of tropical fruits; mango, pineapples, and grapefruit. The malt is pretty much buried, but I am not complaining.
T: The nose did not lie. Citra hops are front and center with mango and pineapple notes taking over. This beer is unbalanced to say the least, but that is pretty much the point. I love it.
M: Medium bodied with some prickly carbonation. The beer finished dry with obviously good attenuation. 
O: This is a pretty rocking APA if that is what you want to call it. It reminds me of some of my home brews that I dump way more hops in than I should, but at the end of the day I like 'em that way! 909 charactersNeffbeer, Aug 02, 2011

taste: very hop-forward, Citra being the flower of choice here. really lovely - bright fresh grapefruit, fresh lemon, tangerine, pineapple, guava. Fantastic APA, but when 3F is involved, style guidelines take a backseat and the hop showcase gets top billing.

Comes in an imperial pint glass looking cloudy and golden. Big head that leaves some nice lacing. Nice looking beer.
Smell is all Citra--crazy pineapple/mango fruitness.
Taste is similar to the nose. No malt flavors here, just lots of tropical fruit tastes. A hint of a musty character I find in Citra beers. Not bitter at all, nor much of a citrus/pine/floral component. 
Medium mouthfeel and nicely carbonated.
Glad I got to try this. If you're a fan of Citra, you'll love this. It's a strange hop. If you've never had it, this is a great example. 593 charactersmusicforairports, Jul 25, 2011

A: Pours a clear golden orange with whitish head that leaves lots of nice lacing around glass.
S: Fantastic, packed with sweet citrus and tropical fruit and some pale malt hiding behind all the fruity hops.
T: Perfect blend of citrus and tropical hop flavors that mingle incredibly well with the pale malt backbone. All the flavor you would expect from a top notch IPA without all the bitterness and a bit more malt.
M: Super smooth medium body with low-moderate carbonation.
O: I am very impressed to say the least, this is exactly what I would like to see more breweries creating. A sessionable pale ale with the hop aroma and flavor of a world class IPA without all the IBUs. Drinkability is off the charts. 784 charactersAzurescens, Jul 23, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Just got back from FFF. I was lucky enough for them to have this on tap today. $5 for a full pint. I have tried most of the other FFF, and was highly anticipating this one. The wait was worth it.
It poured a light amber color. One finger of head, which quickly dissipated. The aroma was fantastic. The hops have an huge aroma of citrus, and the grapefruit smell overwhelmed me. Loved it. As for the taste, after the first sip, I needed a private moment in that I laid Dreadnaught to bed as my once favorite beer. 
I couldn't help but swirl the beer in my glass so I could keep drinking it. I can't wait until later in the year when they finally bottle this. 659 charactersDangQuesadilla, Jul 23, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to enelson for this. Poured into a pint glass.
4.0 A: Moderately hazed golden color. One and a half fingers of pillowy white head. Retention is about average and a good sized, full ring of lacing is left behind.
4.5 S: This APA has the hop aroma of a DIPA. Strong mango, followed by pineapple and orange. Grapefruit and pine after that. Sugary cake icing. No hints of any malt. Pretty clean overall.
4.0 T: The taste isn't as crazy citrusy as the nose. Still there's a good bit of pineapple, mango, and orange. More pine and grapefruit than the nose suggests and not even close to as sugary. Moderate bitterness. A bit of malt this time in the way of breadiness and a light yeastiness. A little less clean than the nose.
4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation, especially for a growler. Reasonably creamy and smooth overall.
4.0 D: This is a pretty good beer. It reminds me a lot of Selin's Grove IPA that I just had a few days ago, but a less intense version of that. Still, I would have no problem drinking this to get a citrusy hop fix. 1,062 charactersDavoleBomb, Jul 21, 2011

A - Pours a light burnt orange color with the half finger's worth of head taking a few seconds to make it's way to the top of the glass. Pours beautifully!
S - Smell begins almost pure citrus, with orange/tangerine being the dominant scent off the bat. Also a nice blend of piney scents to help accentuate the hop profile. Also some lemon in the background.
T - Taste is more hop-forward than the smell, with the bitterness hitting you right off the bat as well as lingering in the aftertaste. The citrus that dominates the scent is more of a background flavor in the beer, and it's not necessarily a bad thing, though I personally would have preferred the same intensity as the nose. Still a very well balanced taste.
M - A little undercarbonated, which may be my fault due to the few days since buying the growler. Still very pleasant on the tongue. 
O - Overall an exceptionally well done APA. Another grew brew from the Floyds! 1,021 charactersMarkIntihar, Jul 21, 2011

Pours a nice light orange with a consistent, multi column stream of tiny bubbles, a frothy cover, and plenty of sticky muckage.
Smell is all Citra: fleshy, white, juicy nectarine, sweaty, dripping tropical fruits on the beach, tangerines, just so damn delicious. 
Basically, this is a Citra delivery vehicles. Touch of honey sweetness and light non salted cracker provides a platter where the tropicality sits poised to entice and inspire. There is a store in town that has samples of all their fat, ripe summer produce available while you shop. This beer has managed to cram much of summer's bounty into a 6 percent package. Bra-fuckin-vo. 
Mouthfeel is lush and natural fruit sugary fresh. Juicy throughout with faintly bitter finish.
This is far and away my favorite beer from a brewery that frustrates me more often than not. Very, very nice. 1,004 charactersBarrytheBear, Jul 21, 2011

Appearance: Served in an 8-oz glass, the Dust comes with barely any head, and what's there dies almost instantly, leaving only a white rim around the glass. Very transparent amber/orange color. reminds me of Nugget Nectar (but not as good). Low carbonation but great lacing. 
Smell: Enticing mild sweetness, floral. Honeysuckle. Some malt, dripping honey. Barbeque ribs and a faint savoriness. A bit of tropics (mango?). Nice enough, but far from amazing. 
Taste: Again, rather uninspiring. Thin, watery finish. Alright bitterness all around, with some stinging hops here and there. Dry, tart at the end of the sip. The Citra hops are mellow, hard to discern. A bit of warm orange juice and bread- breakfast beer!
Mouthfeel: Medium-to-low body, low carbonation. Balanced but on the boring side, unremarkable. Booze does come through when warm. 
Overall: Drinkable, crisp, refreshing. But... whatever. This sure ain't the best APA I have had. As far as single-hop beers go, I have had better. For an outstanding APA, check out Hill Farmstead's Edward.
---Note: Had Zombie on tap at Three Floyds. Much better, fresher, rounder. Still, not the best APA I've had. 1,213 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Jul 19, 2011

Zombie Dust? Hell. Yes. Anything that has anything to do with zombies, count me in. They'll take over the planet one day so why not laugh about 'em now?
A - Poured lightly hazy golden yellow in color with a persistent white head. Dense foam and thick lace are left on the glass. It's pretty good looking for an undead beer!
S - Big citrus hop aroma of mango, pineapple, lemon, and grapefruit. Faint biscuity pale malt backing. Explosive aroma that smells like Citra hops and definitely smells better than rotting flesh...I assume...
T - Bold citrus in the flavor mirrors the aroma with pineapple, lemon, and grapefruit while adding pine needle and resiny sap. Biscuity pale malts back up the hops and remain out of the way. Something just seems off though. Maybe it's the braaaiiinsss.
M - Medium-light bodied and citrusy with a good, dry hop kick and moderate bitterness to the finish. Refreshing! The body of this beer is held together much better than the grotesque flesh of the undead nearly falling off the bone, that's for sure.
O - When the zombie apocalypse comes, this'll be the first refreshing beverage I reach for after I massacre a hoard of zombies only to be overtaken and subsequently forced to out-run them for miles and miles. Seriously though, is this beer unique? No. It's been done plenty of times. But putting that aside, Zombie Dust is another brew which proves Three Floyds certainly know how to use and balance their hops. 1,576 charactersBeerFMAndy, Jul 19, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub while hanging with fellow BA Luk13 and a couple of his friends who drove all the way down from Québec. Cheers!
Appearance – Served in a pint glass. A warm orange color radiates from the glass, with about two fingers of bright white head that dissipates somewhat quickly, leaving spotty lacing on the sides of the glass.
Smell – This honestly blew me away. The aroma was emanating from the glass as it was placed in front of me. Just a massive tropical fruit aroma punches you in the face with the first sniff. As the beer warms you can honestly pick out the mango, pineapple, and guava aromas. The citra hops used are also quite evident and has a slight caramel scent at the end.
Taste – As the nose would lead one to believe, juicy fruits mixed with the hops. The pineapple and mango are up front with the guava kicking in a bit later. As the beer warms it actually becomes a bit more bitter and I pick up more pine and grapefruit. The beer ends with some bready malts and an ever so slight malty backbone.
Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, carbonation to style, creamy, finishes a bit dry/bitter.
Overall – I give crap to FFF often, due to their prices, the fact I can’t find some of their classics ever (i.e. gumballhead), and because they don’t date their bottles. But hot damn if they didn’t get this beer right. I had two glasses of this and can’t wait for it to be in bottles. A fantastic beer that reminds me why FFF is held to such high regards by so many people. 1,519 charactersSpdKilz, Jul 14, 2011

4.97/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well Ladies & Gentlemen....we have a new favorite beer...replacing previuos fav....Two Bros Cane & Ebel. I had this beer at Moe Joes in Downtown Plainfield....excellent restaurant. 
The beer's appearance was downgraded slightly because I would have like to see a bit more head than what was present. Even with the small head...it laced perfectly. The color was golden and clear.
The scent was perfect as far as I was concerned. Beutiful balnce of subtle pine and citrus neither were overbearings that included hints of spice/floral aromas. The taste was incredible a perfec t taste that was not puniched or bolstered by high abv, which made this beer unbelievably drinkable. The smooth taste starts with pine hints then converts to citrus prior to teh swallow and lastly it comes of the pallete clean. I could session this beer all day....all night....wonderful. No question this beer is worth a try!!! 904 charactersWoodBrew, Jul 11, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a growler into a pint glass. Growler 1 day old.
A - Golden yellow with nice frothy white head that lingers. Noticeable carbonation and lacing on the side of the glass.
S - Has that wonderful 3 Floyds hop blend aroma very prevalent in the nose. Have they patented that hop blend by now? Citrus hops and some bitter, but wow, very pungent and a delight to smell. The nose makes this beer very inviting and exciting to taste.
T - The bitter hops hit with that citrus flavor rounding out the taste and giving it a smooth rounded taste. Malt/barley flavor is light in the back but noticeable to give this a full flavor. The hops are right on though, making this beer delicious without being overbearing. The great hop blend, full flavor, and refreshing taste probably make this one of the best APAs I've tasted.
M - This is amazing mouthfeel for all the hops. Quite smooth with just some bitterness giving heaviness. Carbonation is just right to make the flavors pop. Very easy to drink.
O - Great APA. I can't state enough how great that hop blend is in this, just right and delicious. Would definitely seek this out again. I will have no problem making sure this growler disappears. 1,196 charactersScrumtralecent, Jul 11, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was my first trip ever to the Three Floyds brewpub and Zombie Dust was my first choice! This was the beer that I was looking forward the most to drinking and I didn't get my hopes up too high after the letdown at DFH a few weeks back. I was very excited to see Zombie Dust written on the chalk board!
Anyway I had this on tap and it was served to me in a pint glass with a great hazy golden body with an inch and a half white lead that left some nice lacing. The aroma was fantastic, a ton of citrus and grapefruit coming out with plenty of hops and hints of malt and pine.
The taste was outstanding, goes hand and hand with the aroma with a decent amount of bitterness yet at the same time you get a bit of a dry tropical fruit notes at the end. 
The mouthfeel was great, medium bodied, and smooth, easy to drink with a dry ending.
This is a fantastic APA, a ton of hops combined with a ton of flavor, I wish I lived closer than five and a half hours away to enjoy this beer more often. 996 charactersDan3279, Jul 10, 2011
4.71/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got a few pints at Pony Bar NYC, thank god somehow they can get FFF kegs or else I this wouldnt be possible.
Only drawback 8oz pours at this bar, wrong glassware?
A- Pours hazy golden yellow with white fluffy head that just sits there and doesn't move. Awsome. Great retention and lacing that sticks to the glass. One of the few "5" appearances I've seen
especially for this style.
S- Smells like APA keeping IPA hostage. I can get the fruit notes, floral and piney hops a bit but its very muted. I can tell they'res something there but not overpowering, possibly result of glassware.
T- Damn. Poof. Pow. Insert adjective here. I wish every APA tasted like this. Citrus up front, with nice fruit notes pineapple, mango as well. Good balance. The unfiltered character comes through in the finish, hence the dust.
M - Slightly leans away from lighter body, which is good for me. Slight bitter finish that lingers just long enough to be appealing and leave you wanting more.
D - I downed 2X 8oz pours in about 10 minutes. Could probably down a growler with no issues here.
Definitely best APA I've ever had. Tie for best FFF brew with Arctic Panzer Wolf. If they had this as their flagship APA I think they'd be more famous than they already are, get yourself some bottles of this stuff. 1,291 charactersbeenitty, Jul 09, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at the brewpub, several pints of it at $5 each. This is a seriously tasty pale ale, I think it might be my very favorite of the style.
The beer is a clear light golden color, SRM of 3-3.5 or so. Several fingers of frothy white foam, with sheets of lace on the walls of the glass as it emptied. Big citrus aroma, pungent fresh hops evoking tropical fruits and lots of citra character. Some nice malty sweetness gives a bit of balance but the hops are the highlight.
Waves of tropical fruit flavor, pineapple and grapefruit, some mango and tangerine, everything. It's initial sweetness is tempered by a lingering bitter aftertaste, along with some mild pale malt breadiness. This is so hoppy I might consider it an IPA, a very good IPA at that. But it's called an APA on the board so it therefore is my favorite take on an APA.
The carbonation is on the light side, halfway to a cask feel, excellent. It makes me wonder how much more I might like it if it was served on cask. Excellent, I bought 2 growlers to take home. Delicious stuff, very highly recommended. 1,070 charactersTurdFurgison, Jul 08, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The first time I had Zombie Dust I was told I HAD TO HAVE it by the server at FFF. So, of course, I had it.
And I'm glad I did. I think it is as advertised, and I have become a zombie, but instead of craving braaainnns, I just crave more Zombie Dust.
The brew is the color of pineapple juice, but more opaque. Aroma is of tropical, fruity hops. Both times I've had the beer, there was not much of a head at all. 
The flavor, though, that's what it's all about here. As a previous reviewer said - this seems more like an IPA than an APA. In fact I'd always ass-u-med it was an IPA. Then again styles have so much overlap - plus FFF doesn't really hold to strict styles anyway. Super strong grapefruit/pineapple hop flavor. Nice bitterness. Not much malt character, but it's there... well in the background.
This is a good one - you've got to try it if you get the chance. I prefer it over the Cow. 900 charactersModemMisuser, Jul 06, 2011

4.7/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Draft served in a pint glass
A: Dark yellow in color and has just a little bit of fizzy head. 
S: Smells spicy and a little bit hoppy along with some tangerine.
T/M: Taste is extraordinary, predominantly oranges mixed with a medium amount of hops and good carbonation. It’s very refreshing and I’d love to keep a few bottles around when I’m in the mood, if they come in bottles. 
If I were Three Floyds, I’d make it in bottles. Maybe have a combo pack that includes a baseball bat with exposed nails in the top, you know, to prepare you for the inevitable zombie apocalypse. 586 charactersTheBeerAlmanac, Jun 29, 2011

20oz. into a Nonic Pint.
A- Pours a nice hazy golden yellow-amber color with about a 1 finger brilliant white head that sits atop for a good amount of time before dying down to a thin rim. Great retention and lacing that sticks to the glass.
S- Absolutely bursting with citrus hops, orange, pineapple, and sweet malts. A touch of floral hops and piney notes come through as well. Simple by design, yet flawlessly executed. I smelled this for a good couple minutes before diving in.
T- Bold citrus hops come through with some pineapple, grapefruit and mango sweetness, followed by a solid malt backbone that showcases the hops. There's a bitter pine hop presence at the back as well. Beautifully integrated flavors here.
M- Lighter body with perfect carbonation. Great bitter finish that lingers just long enough to be appealing and leave you wanting more.
O- This is a simple beer that does something simple exceptionally well: showcase Citra hops. It's also extremely drinkable, as I had to 20oz. pours in about 30 minutes. I'm thankful that Three Floyds has decided to bottle this, as it's about the only beer from them that I will consistently have stocked in my fridge at all times. 1,270 charactersJoshVandy, Jun 27, 2011

Pale golden-amber body capped by an inch of frothy, sticky head. Fantastic juicy ripe fruit aroma, melon coming to mind initially, followed by pineapple and guava. Not much malt character to speak of on the nose. Crispy, light, bready palate. Big hop flavor, pineapple and grapefruit up front, guava in the background - very juicy stuff. A very slight note of diacetyl that softens up the texture in a nice way. Mild, clean bitterness in the finish. 483 characterslargadeer, Jun 26, 2011

Thin lacing lasts throughout nicely. Aroma is redolent of all types of citrus - mango, grapefruit, lemon peel, pineapple, and maybe a hint of green apple and honey. Taste is an utter hop bomb mango and grapefruit. Mild caramel dominate the palate. Body is medium with lower than average carbonation, oily on the tounge, and finishes extra dry with a very long lasting bitter citrus aftertaste. This was a really interesting APA. Glad to have tried this one out! 563 charactersCuriousMonk, Jun 25, 2011

4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a tapered FFF glass.
High clarity orange, slowly rising trails of carbonation. Creamy cap of dense foam, about a half inch at first that recedes after awhile, leaving concentric rings of lace. Skim across the top eventually breaks, but lasts for a bit.
Pungent citrus, grapefruit and tangerine, rich with citrus-heavy Citra hops. 
Fruity hops hit first, more tangerine, sweet orange and grapefruit notes upfront. Resiny sticky hops linger into the pale malt middle, clean and a little grainy. Dry leafy green bitterness in the finish, hints of aspirin. Feel is relatively light, creamy and soft at first, drying out into the bitter finish. Good malty balance to the hefty dose of hoppage, approaching IPA territory for sure. Can't wait for the bottles, this is basically FFF's 1-up to local classic Daisy Cutter.
2015 and beyond: 3.9-4.0 Bottles have been consistently disappointing. 897 charactersemerge077, Jun 18, 2011

Small creamy beige head. Medium carbonation. Slightly hazy golden brown. Aroma is citric with a faint aspirin undertone. Lots of grapefruit initially with a touch of tropical fruitiness. Some maltiness for balance, then it is right back to citrus and grapefruit hoppy bitterness. Not over the top mouth puckering but plenty to let you know what the focus of this beer is. Citrus and grapefruit throughout. Medium creamy body, alcohol seems less than 6.2%. Finish and aftertaste are lingering citric bitterness, but not overpowering.
Seems to lean more towards an IPA to me. 637 charactershtomsirveaux, Jun 15, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5(Served in a stemmed pint glass)
A- This beer pours a hazy golden yellow body with a thick creamy beige head that last for a good bit. There is a gentle carbonation of big bubbles gliding to the surface.
S- The full green hops have aromas of white grape juice and cat pee with a fruity pine finish. 
T- The smooth full hop flavor changes as the beer opens up. It starts with tropical fruit flavors and blends into white grape juice and pine with a mellow pungent flavor at the finish and just a touch of bitterness that lingers after each sip. 
M- This beer has a medium-light mouthfeel with no alcohol heat noticed. 
O- This is a full flavored hop monster with a soft bitterness but even for this big beer it is very sessionable. The depth and character of the hops really work together wonderfully. 805 charactersrhoadsrage, Jun 14, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From notes.
Appearance- Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a very frothy white head. Good retention and lacing left down the pint glass.
Smell- Loads of citrus, as expected. Mostly grapefruit.
Taste- Citrus again, surprise! Zesty grapefruit, lemon, some mandarin orange, and mango. A slight grassiness as well. Fairly bitter overall, but balanced by a slightly bready malt presence.
Mouthfeel- Medium body and carbonation, very smooth.
Overall- I was very excited to finally try this. It is obviously very very good, but perhaps a bit over hyped. If they ever do get around to bottling this I will definitely have to pick up a six pack every now and then, but I still think I prefer Alpha King. Either way, another very solid beer from the boys at Three Floyds.

A: Slightly hazy pale orange body under an inch of solidly frothy ecru head. Nice retention and lacing. Lovely.
S: Hugely hoppy, with grapefruit and pine to spare. There's an herbal hop note that resembles the basil in pizza crust. Crazy.
T: Herbal hops dominate, leading to a cleanly bitter finish. Simple and terrific, but I expected more fruitiness - isn't this supposed to be all Citra hops?
M: Soft medium body with ample carbonation.
O: Great APA, but why not just call it the IPA that it clearly is? I'm sorry I spilled the last third of my plastic cup when I went outside, but since I did so in my hurry to get a pour of Melange #1 I can't cry too much. Zombie Dust was awesome, but I'm kind of surprised that it's a Top 100 beer.

Poured into a Half Acre pint glass. Clear, light-orange body with about a fingers worth of white foamy head. Good lacing all the way down to the bottom of the glass.
Could smell this one right away as I cracked the cap on the growler. Juicy, fresh, hops, lots of citrus and some sweet malts lingering in the background of the aroma. Piny, grassy, hops and dry orange wedge.
Orange-lemon citrus on the tongue with a good helping of grassy hops. Malty-bready notes beneath. Has a good hop kick to it for an APA, but the base beer keeps it true to the style. Touch of pepper from the hops on the finish. Very easy to drink.
Mouthfeel is smooth and chewy up front, but still manages to finish crisp and clean on the finish. Nice weight to the body. No sign of the 6.2% ABV.
Overall, this is an excellent APA. Definitely one the best I've had. Right up there with Hill Farmstead's Edward. Really easy to drink with lots of flavor. A great summer beer. Highly recommended for the style! 1,015 characterssisuspeed, May 26, 2011

Tastes very bitter up front in a tongue-tingling way. Tons of flavor in every sip. Decent citrus rind character, not zesty but solid. Bitterness gives way to a nutty, malty and slightly meaty finish. Carbonation is small, tingly and comes in waves. Medium-bodied with a silky, voluminous mouthfeel. Slightly dry, just slightly. Pretty drinkable.

This pours a nice looking pale gold with a small white head that dies leaving a little lace. On the nose, it feels like shoving a freshly peeled orange skin into one's sinuses. It's a gigantic citrus hit, totally fresh, totally refreshing. In the mouth there is more of the same, not really a lack of a malt backbone because I didn't miss it, but just enough to provide a frame for some intense peeled citrus. The orange takes center stage and if there is much else, I missed it while enjoying the orange so much. The body is medium light and there is a long finish, striking a good balance between being interesting enough to drink but not too overwhelming to drink again, and again, and again.
Overall, this is an absolutely amazing brew. For me it blows Alpha King out of the water. The citra hops are just so vivid here with little to get in their way, but it's never unbalanced. A great, great beer. Please bottle soon. 1,002 charactersEricCioe, May 13, 2011

Aroma of huge Citra hops. Lemon zest, mango. And caramel maltiness providing a nice background.

4.42/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.564 oz growler into a pint glass. Huge thanks go to Stakem for grabbing this for me on a recent trip out to the brewery for Dark Lord Day. 
Pours a clear copper in the glass, topped with a couple fingers of eggshell-white head. This retains with a soapy ½ finger, which drenches the sides of the glass with rich sticky lacing. The aroma pops in the nose, with a fresh and floral feel that carries a sticky mix of ripe tropical fruit, sweet grains, and more bitter smelling grapefruit notes which cut through the center of the nose. Maybe just a smidge of alcohol warmth hangs on the edges here but it mostly serves to give this some presence in the nostrils. 
The taste mirrors the aroma, with a fresh and biting grapefruit character that controls this with a zesty bitterness that spreads out into the mouth. This is balanced along the back by a sticky sweet blend of tropical fruitiness and sweet malts. This finishes with lingering dry notes of pine and bitter pith, which while aggressive, still manages a fresh and bright feeling itself that hangs in the mouth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a firm prickly creaminess that blows up in the mouth but then gets slicker on the sides as this heads towards the swallow. That 6% ABV feels spot on in the mouth, giving this a touch of assertiveness on the palate but without any warming alcohol flavors to speak of. 
This is a just another in a long line of awesome hoppy beers from Three Floyds, as this stands right up there along such other fantastic APAs from them as the Alpha King and Pride & Joy. There is a LOT of fruity sweetness to this from those Citra hops, which took me a bit to wrap my palate round, but once more of that balancing grapefruit bitterness came out to play, I was fully on board. I hope rumors of the eventual bottling of this come to fruition. 1,831 charactersKegatron, May 09, 2011

I've had this many times over the years, and every time it's been better since that DLD. Super easy to drink and one of my favorite APA's ever...bumping it up a bit. 706 charactersmdfb79, May 09, 2011
4/5  rDev -11.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Deep orange color, mercy and dense looking. A one finger white fluffy head, based on the tap pour I think the growler is a touch flatter than the tap version. Very nice lacing is starting to form as well.
Just straight up citrus grape fruit from the second the growler is opened. 
Sharp citrus opening, blast of grape fruit with perhaps a bit of lemon zest. The malt here adds weight at the start, but perhaps the least impact I’ve ever noticed. I just can’t describe any flavor from the malt, just the sugary weight of it. At the same time there is a decent amount of weight from the malt the finish is surprisingly watery. Warmer the watery flavor is less noticeable and the malt/hops just linger longer. Still no real complexity. 
The mouth feel and the taste go hand in hand. A bit more weight than some of the cleaner IPAs out there, but a surprisingly void of flavor finish leaves me almost thinking I just finished a glass of water. The hops then come back to linger, but this is an odd mix. The carbonation is a touch low, but I think again this is an impact of the growler and not the beer itself. 
This would make an amazing 6 pack style regular release IPA for three floyds. It isn’t over powering or overly intense, but it has that wonderful grape fruit kick. I’m torn on this one unlike any beer I’ve had in a while. The flavors are amazing, but they lack the intense notes I want. The finish doesn’t excite me and the carbonation doesn’t add anything helpful. 
Since this is called a pale ale, I'm not sure what to say there. In many ways it is more pale ale than IPA but the hops are just so in your face.... 1,642 charactersbobhits, May 07, 2011

A: Deep burnt orange color. The pour dropped a finger and a half of cream colored head that left great sticky lace.
A: Intense sticky hop nose. Notes of pine sap, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. There is a hefty malt backbone to balance out the hoppy nose. Also get some candi sugar for sweetness.
T: I obviously get the hops up front, the citrus and pine sap are prevalent. This is followed by a carmel malt backbone. It finishes dry, bitter, and creamy.
M: Rather thick for an APA. Creamy, but good carbonation.
O: Really nice. I don't think this is an APA, way more of an IPA, but nonetheless, very nice brew. I hope they bottle this. Skal. 729 charactersGtreid, May 06, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Rated on tap at Three Floyds on DLD Eve, but enjoyed all DLD as well. This glass of the good stuff was consumed in the company of the Founders of Founders, love those guys. Served in an Imperial Pint glass for around $6.
Zombie Dust has a great look going on - it certainly has nothing in common with its namesake, actual Zombies or dust. The beer is a bright orange copper color with some streaks of gold and honey swirling around. The beer is cloudy, not clear, or really maybe just hazy - point being, there's little if any clarity and no noticeable carbonation. A white head sits on top then fades quickly, leaving some nice lace.
The smell is where this beer starts to shine. The citra hops have lended their unique citrus notes to the nose, and the luscious fruit scents are incredible. Ripe pineapple, lemon rind, orange pith and grapefruit are all present and accounted for. The malt is nowhere to be found. This is a tropical hop lovers dream and, were it just a touch more expressive, would be the perfect APA nose.
The taste is also very, very impressive. The start of the show is again the hoppy citrus and tropical notes. Some wonderful orange, grapefruit and lemon notes aren't overly bitter, but, instead, add enough juicyness to make my mouth water and never taste abrasive. A touch of sweetness from the malt helps too. The base is just a touch bready, but has a nice sugar sweetness like powdered sugar. A touch of yeast is also noticed mid-way through. This may seem a bit unbalanced to the purists, but, for me, this is a perfect hop-forward, almost "West-Coast" APA.
The mouthfeel was nice but perhaps the only weak link in the armor of a solid offering. It wasn't bad, but the light body was a touch grainy and, while the carb was perfect, the finish was a bit dry and bitter. Overall, Zombie Dust is the real deal - a beer every lover of hops, citra, and APA's should have on their radar. I'll be sure to grab some bottles if they come out, but, in the meantime, I'll be asking for growlers from anyone passing by FFF. Awesome beer, perhaps a bit overhyped, but solid nonetheless. 2,107 charactersjampics2, May 05, 2011

On cask at Pizza Port Real Ale 2011.
A: Translucent light orange with a large and impressive creamy white head which shows remarkable retention. Nice color.
S: Light tangerine with some grassy and herbal notes. I get some peach and orange. Expressive citrus. No malt influence. Very nice.
T: Malt is slightly grainy but not real influential. Low bitterness with a lot of hop flavor: tangerine, orange, and a little grapefruit. All flesh, no rind. Exceptional flavor.
M: Upper light in body with nice upper low cask carbonation. Smooth, dry, and sticky mouthfeel.
Overall: Outstanding stuff. So damn drinkable. I had 3 pours of this. 648 charactersHopHead84, May 05, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5on tap during DLD
Pours a hazed golden color with a thicker fluffy white head. Plenty of wispy film along with spotty curtains of lacing. 
Strong scents of floral hops, swirled with fruit sweetness and citrus. Lighter notes of doughy malts smooth out the scents with a hint of spice. 
Whoa, an explosion of juicy hop deliciousness up front! Citrus and floral notes with a tempered amount of sweetness. Notes of tropical fruits with apricot and pineapple. Soft malted backbone with lighter toasted biscuit and faint caramel. Some more spicy hoppiness towards the finish which is somewhat bitter and dry. 
Medium bodied, slightly higher carbonation, smooth and easy on the palate and ultra drinkable. This was absolutely fantastic - I like it more than Alpha King. 766 charactersxnicknj, May 04, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I had this on-tap at the brewpub, poured into an imperial pint glass.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy yellow golden color with a half finger of fluffy white head that fades quickly and leaves a ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Sweet citrus hops with hints of tangerine and pineapple, nice and refreshing.
Taste: There is a lot of bitterness, but it doesn't completely kill your tongue. Mildly sweet malt and some nice hints of citrus fruit. This is a very nice beer.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with aggressive carbonation. The finish is very dry.
Overall: Another success from 3 Floyds. The balance is great with just the right amount of bitterness that dominates but doesn't crush the other flavors or your tongue. 720 charactersoline73, May 03, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served at FFF pub into Imperial Pint glass...
A- Very orange color that sits in the glass with a slight haze; inch of foam atop. As the beer is drank it leaves a tiny bit of lacing here and there.
S- Holy hell. All citrus. Oh my goodness this is just incredible. I want a million air fresheners of this scent with me at all times. It is just so prounounced and crisp I can't get over that this might be the best smelling beer I have had to date. If you can think of a citrusy fruit- that fruit is in this aroma!
T/M- This is where I cry; in a good way. I almost had an emotional breakdown when this beer first touched my lips. Again, this beer is all citrus/all the time. Orange/Tangerine and pineapple take the forefront but backed up by a complexity of other fruits associated with Citra hops. There is also a nice tiny sweetness that plays peek-a-boo on your palate that is some sort of a gumball-y flavor. Its nice to get a malt presence in a beer that isn't the same old caramel/toffee/biscuit. IBUs on the high said for an APA, but I like it like that. Balance is spot on and mouthfeel is great. Nice medium body and moderate carbonation with a decently dry finish make this an awesome and refreshing beer.
O- Seriously, this is the best APA I have had to date and I don't know if it can get much better. I also had the 3Kings on this trip to the pub and though that was also an A beer, this one just rocks; its unreal. I ended up buying a growler to go of both ZD and 3Kings because these APAs made me have an out of body experience. Thank you FFF for creating Zombie Dust... 1,586 charactersTheGordianKnot, May 03, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Enjoyed from the tap at the Three Floyds brewpub, poured inside a nonic pint.
Very hazy honey color, with only a shadow of a finger visible behind. A fluffy, one-finger head of pure white sits atop, and great sticky walls of bubbles grip the sides as I descend through the glass. 
Crazy-good citrus hop aroma. Incredible, actually. Pine, grass, dank weed, onions, honey, crackers and a light earthiness.
Not as bitingly hoppy as nose would suggest. Fresh grass, onions, hints of citrus and honey. Pale cracker malt sweeps in at the clean, crisp finish. Very hoppy for a pale ale, but the balance never gets out of whack. 
Lightly prickly carbonation, amidst a hefty, silky-smooth medium body. Alcohol numbs the tongue just a bit, as do hints of micro-bubbled fizz. Crisp, clean finish keeps you coming back for more, and quickly. 
I hope Three Floyds does what everyone around me was suggesting and puts this on their regular rotation. Incredible complexity for a single hop IPA. Citrus hops are much more versatile than I thought. 1,036 charactersPhelps, May 02, 2011

A: Pours a golden yellow with a touch of orange, has a 1 finger white foam. Good retention.
S: Citrus hops all the way, which give way to lemon, grapefruit and pine. Smells great.
T: Follows the nose. The citrus from the hops lends its way to lemon, grapefruit, and mangos.

Taste: Hoppy but mellow, It bites but not that bad.

On tap at Three Floyds on the day before Dark Lord Day. Served in an imperial pint.
Appearance
A glowing apricot orange with a very dense head, the consistency of cask ale pumped through a sparkler tip. Lots of heavy lacing.
Aroma
The nose is bombed by pineapple fruit. Grapefruit comes in to round it out with a little bit of a rind-like bitterness. But in all its a sweeter smelling beer, concentrated with hops. 
Taste
Very in line with the nose, in that there is a huge burst of pineapple, edged with grapefruit. Very juicy and tropical. This is how I like my hoppy beers. Peripherals of mango, peach and orange build the juicy body of this beer. I'm not totally convinced this is an APA, but its too good to make any arguments that are that meaningless. 
Mouthfeel
Drrryyy, dry-dry. It gives this beer a nice abrupt, cleansing finish that keeps this beer going down quickly. Even though the alcohol is high for the style it makes not much of a showing. 
Overall
A tropical fruit, pineapple bomb, and I love it. I can't wait for this to find its way into bottles. When it does I will be making some trades. 1,140 charactersMbpBugeye, May 02, 2011

Appearance: a hazy orange/ golden color, an unfiltered appearance. Well carbinated with great head, really helps out teh beer. 
Smell: Curt grass, grapefruit and orange. 
Taste: Big hop body without being too over the top. Something new in the taste here its its own thing. The grapefruit shines through but in more of a sweet vs. sour way. 
Mouthfeel: Carbonation rocks the flavors all the way down.
Overall: High in ABV but I sessioned the hell out of it yesterday. Probably why I feel like a zombie today lol. Very impressive, I am not an IPA APA guy and loved this. Please bottle this!!!

This beer reminds me of a growth-stunted little gymnast from a former Soviet bloc country. 
Clad in a spandex onesie that clearly shows a hormone-hobbled anatomical development, it mounts the high beam. Flipping and twirling, defying gravity, somehow finding perfect footing after every stunning movement. Balance. A sense of one's place in the universe that bestows a quiet confidence and peaceful mind. Zombie Dust has this kind of balance.
Hops balanced with malts balanced with sweet balanced with bitter. This beer should have been called Zen Rock Garden. I cannot wait to buy it in bottles. 713 charactersjohnbjaeger, May 01, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a bright slightly hazed yellow/golden color with a half inch white head.
Great aromatics. Very reminiscent of an New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Cat pee galore, gooseberry, obviously loads of citrus mainly grapefruit and freshly zested lemon, light biscuity malt aromas in the back but mainly just that citra hop.
Tastes very much like it smell. Has that character Floyds minerality, flinty flavor and feel to it from the house yeast? Or water? Great acidity in the middle and a long drawn out finish. Again cat pee, citrus, dominate very juicy, oily hops not to bitter on the finish but oh so tasty. 605 charactersmcallister, Apr 29, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a shaker pint glass at The Firkin.
Missed this one before, but now I get to try it on cask. Second chances rock. It pours a clear, bright, lemony straw topped by a finger of cream-white froth and populated by some minor floaties. Were it not for that last bit, this would probably look damn near perfect. The nose comprises orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, apricot, very light leek, and mild caramel. The taste holds notes of orange zest, orange rind, lemon peel, grapefruit (both red and white), light pine, mandarin orange, and some even milder caramel than before. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light carbonation and a rich, smooth feel. Overall, a very nice APA. I probably didn't think as highly of it as many, but it is a damn fine beer, let me tell you. 792 charactersTMoney2591, Apr 25, 2011

Appearance: Hazy golden color with medium carbonation and a nice thick white head. Laces on the glass. First pint I got was poured up to the top so I was wondering where the head had gone...
Smell: Really wonderful aromas from the hop: grassy/floral, but mostly citrus - grapefruit, and a nice sweetness which reminded me of either honey or peach.
Taste: Big hop body without being too bitter. I didn't note any real malt taste. Tart, tangy, and crisp on the finish. 
Mouthfeel: Carbonation leaves a nice tingle in the mouth, and the beer doesn't seem thin or watery.
Overall: Enjoyable APA: too boozy to be a session beer, but one that really lets you enjoy the hop flavor without making your mouth pucker. I was really impressed by the tangy sweetness of this beer, and I'll definitely look for it as the weather warms up. 979 charactersEORS, Apr 20, 2011

S:Amazing smell coming out of this. Big tropical notes, citrus, grapefruit, with a little sweetness as well. I could not keep my nose out of the glass.
T:Get slight sweetness up front before the citrus attack comes on full force rolling across the palate in all of its glory. Slight bitterness and hop juiciness hangs around after the sip is long gone. Absolutly great!!
M:Body is smooth and fairly light, sweetness on the lips and hops on the tongue equal out very nicely.
D:Extremely drinkable, had my first imperial pint down in the matter of 15-20 minutes while still talking to a fellow patron. Ended up having another one and wanted to keep going after that was done but unfortunatly had to go.

This beer pours a slightly hazy pale color, there is but only a slight head on the surface. The smell is great citrusy hops, there is really not malt in the aroma, but there really doesn't have to be with this beer. The flavor is the perfect combination of hops with the slightly sweet malt background. It's so simplistic and so well done. It goes down so smooth, there isn't too much bittering, this is the most perfect beer for this style. I really really like this beer. It's too simplistic to have much detail into this citrusy wonderfully hoppy APA, but damn if I don't love it. 641 charactersVdubb86, Apr 14, 2011

Aroma: Big floral hop aroma and citrus
Appearance: Nice hazy golden color with a foamy white head that dissipates quickly leaving sticky lace clinging to the side of the glass
Taste: Citrus, Tangerine, great hop flavor and just the right amount of bitterness, balanced slightly with sweet malt
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and body
Drinkability: This brew is extremely good, at 6.2% ABV, it's not meant to be a session beer, but it is so delicious that I don't care, I'll drink the entire growler in one sitting
Notes: Zombie Dust is a single hop (Citra hops from Yakima Valley) American Pale Ale, one of my favorite styles. Rumor has it that 3 Floyds is going to start bottling Zombie Dust within the next few months, a move that I fully embrace. This brewery was already in my top 3 before; Zombie Dust makes them #1 in my book. I can't say enough about this beer... drop what you are doing, drive to Munster and get some. If they don't have it on tap when you get there, camp out until they do.

4.62/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with a slight orange hue. There are two finger of white foam that recedes and leaves a small ring on the glass.
The smell is tropical citrus, Orange, Tangerine, and notes of floral sweetness. I could smell the citrus as soon as the growler was opened, very entoxicating and wonderfull.
The taste is much the same as the smell. Tropical fruit and orange, followed by bitter pine. The malt backbone is very smooth and really lets the hops do their magic. The finish is slightly dry, crisp, and very refreshing.
The mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Carbonation is spot on, just right.
Overall this is one fantastic beer. The more I drink of it, the more I love it, and I thought it was fanastic to start with. 751 charactersrmalinowski4, Apr 03, 2011

I had nothing to take notes with so this is all from memory. It poured a pale yellow / straw color and has a great, citrusy, orange smell. The nose on this beer is amazing. It didn't have a lot of head but the lacing was spectacular.
The first sip goes down oh so smooth. It is very crisp and juicy. I get lots of orange citrus taste that was so present in the nose. It is a little dry but not overbearing. I want more! Alpha King is a great beer, especially for a flagship brew, but this APA is several notches above it in my opinion. I can't wait for this to hit bottles and I can't even get them here when it does! 726 characterswalteez, Mar 28, 2011

The color of this beer was a nice hazy golden color with a nice ring of foam around the top.
The smell of this one was very citrusy. It smelled like lemons, orange peel, and to my nose a little like apricot.
The taste of this was fantastic and included an opening salvo of citrus hops and lemon peel with a nice amount of hop bitterness that really came together to make one of the best brews I have ever tasted. The flavor on this one was really unique to me.
The mouthfeel of the zombie dust was a crisp dry feeling that I found refreshing, especially when combined with the beer's actual flavor.
Overall this is an excellent choice and I was ecstatic to see it on tap, definitely will get this one whenever I see it available. 778 charactersIchabodcraneIpa, Mar 19, 2011

4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Wadsey for the growler.
A - Deep orange hue with a beautiful fluffy white head and very nice lacing
S - Grapefruits, oranges, citrusy and piney hop notes. Not as floral as KRBC Citra, but that's an unfair comparison.
T - citrus and pine, light body Bitter, resinous after-taste (but in a positive way).
M - medium-high carbonation. great mouth-feel. As expected from a APA, IPA
D - Let's say the growler was pretty much dusted solo. Very quaffable and refreshing. I wish it was a warmer evening in LA. 516 charactersteamizm, Mar 13, 2011

Grapefruit pith and a range of tropical fruit esters fill the nose: grapefruit, mango, pineapple, guava aromas. Medium bodied but pale, substantial lacing and rich feeling; creamy. Murky straw towards wheat brown. Delicious.
Missed the hand-pull cask by one pint and was disappointed when they brought me a porter. Thankfully they did not charge me for it, but I had been looking forward to a side-by-side comparison of Zombie dust cask with the tap. That dream must wait. As I await a bottling of this amazing beer. 611 characterssalvo, Mar 12, 2011

A- Is slightly hazy orangish gold (though the brewpub is so dark it was hard to determine). Three finger frothy off-white head that typifies a cask pull. Head dissipates into a thin film. Plenty of lacing on the glass. 
S- Subdued due to the cask pull (had the draft after), still lots of hop smell. Citrus overtones with orange peel and grapefruit. Not much of a malt tone.
T- Smooth. An explosion of citrus notes on the tip of the palate followed caramel backbone that leaves the palate wanting more.
M- Light to medium body with correct amount of carbonation for cask, but not necessarily the style. Did not linger in the mouth.
D- I liked both the draft and cask, but in the end preferred the subdued quality of the cask more. I enjoyed this beer when it was called Cenotaph and continue to enjoy it as Zombie Dust. Would gladly buy in any format that is produced and sold. 966 charactersbetsona, Mar 11, 2011

Review # 600. Boo yah!
A- Nice snowdrift-white head on an orangey, glowing body. Pretty good pour here, sticky head with moderately heavy lacing. 
S- Big sticky hop goodness. Nose is full of citrus fruit, sweet and inviting. 
T- Citra! Oranges and tangerines. Very fruity. It's amazing how tasty these hops are.. def. one of my favorite varieties. Like biting into an orange. Malt is indistinguishable, this one's all about the hops. Not terribly complex... but I'm OK with it.
M- Spectacular carbonation, perfect balance, no off-notes, nothing out of place. Pretty damn impressive. 
D- Very high... killed the growler and still wanted more. I think this beer would be better with a few more hop varieties to round out the citra, but as a single-hop beer it's pretty stunning. 
I have been infected with the zombie dust and I am now craving CITRA... MMM CITRA... CCIIITRAAA.... 982 charactersShogoKawada, Mar 11, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The single-hop parade continues its march throughout the Three Floyds camp with, this time: Citra hops. As the name suggests, the citrus flavor and aroma proclaims a pungent, ripe (sweet) tropical character for smoothness and roundness unlike any that I've ever tasted!
This golden-amber Pale Ale carries a rich cloudy appearance that's a signature look for aggresively dry-hopped beers. A foathy lather of foam blankets the beer and doing so with stubborn retention, while medium lace leaves its imprint on the glass with each sip as the beer falls.
An overwhelming plethera of citrus and tropical fruit flavors dictate the nose with a unwaivering balance of light caramel, bready, sweet-scented malts. The ripe citurs/tropeial characer from the signature Citra hops are becomming of the very best hoppy American beers.
Citrus flavors of ruby red grapefruit pulp, tangerines, and a slight lemon acidity is accompanied with tropical flavors of fresh pineapple, mangos, appricots, and papaya in a musty and resiny taste. Complexity is defined as promoting a new flavor with each sip, so it's unusual to see this level of complexity with a beer that only employs one variety of hops. Lightly bready, slightly caramelly, and with a mild powdered sugar sweetness; the malt flavors fall timid to the smooth bitterness and supple support of rip citrusy hops that garner respect. The pronounce hop character questions whether the balance of this beer favors the proclaimed Pale Ale or the stronger IPAs...? 
Smooth and with a delicate weight on the mouth, the beer starts with a semi-sweet and creamy malt complex but has an even fade to allow the malts to reduce and the hops to rise, creating an impression of smooth bitterness and a crisply dry finish.
Zombie Dust is a very smooth American Pale Ale with exquisite citrus and tropical fruit flavor. While some prefer the more intense pang of bitterness in the throat, this ale is much more delicate and soft than more conventional hop-forward beers- making a standout that has no competition! 2,043 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 11, 2011

A: Pours an opaque orange/marigold body. It pours with 1" of off-white foam, with excellent retention, great lace, and a good cap on the beer. 
S: Orange pith, tangerine, apricot. It has a beautiful variety of citrus flesh, with very little rind / pine. The malt character is a simple biscuit note. It doesn't have as much tropical variety as Citra (kind of my gold standard for Citra-hopped beers -- and yes, I realize I'm comparing a DIPA to an APA, but dry-hop pickup should be relatively comparable, no?). 
T: This is good. As mentioned above, it has no tropical citrus flavors, but rather straight 'continental' varieties, if that's a distinction that makes sense. There isn't much malt flavor, though there is some heft to the body. There's a little rind-like bitterness in the aftertaste. 
M: Medium-bodied. There's a very light burn / astringency at the finish. 
D: This is very drinkable, and very tasty. I think I put away most of the growler on my own. Fantastic stuff. 1,069 charactersArbitrator, Mar 09, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Zombie Dust (awesome name) pours a pale, slightly cloudy yellow color with a beige head. The slick looking head melts slowly into the beer and leaves quite nice lace. It has a slightly cloudy look to it that is especially evident when compared to my fellow BA's Cortez.
The aroma is very fresh and bright with a load of sweet orange, white grapefruit and pineapple. There is also a little bit of fairly neutral sweetness and... well, really not much else. Citra hops are the main player in the aroma.
The flavor is more complex than I had imagined. Along with the fresh citrus hops described in the aroma, there is a very nice cracker like malt sweetness with a bit of toastiness. The hoppyness has a dry peppery character and some white grapefruit that mingle well with yeasty flavors that manifest themselves half way through each sip.
The mouthfeel is between medium and light with a finish that is very dry, but not aggressive like some super hoppy APAs. The finish leaves plenty of citrusy flavors on my pallet.
This is definitely a crushable (makes beer chugging gesture) beer that I am now really regretting that I did not get a growler of. I found it to be very similar to some of the super hoppy west coast APAs that I have tried, but with just enough of that more balanced Midwest feel to make it that much more enjoyable. 1,336 characterszoso1967, Feb 21, 2011

The taste reminded me of Double Trouble from Founders which is a bit random, but it's what immediately came to mind. Maybe not as complex a taste but still really strong. Great hops presence, good sweetness but not to cloying. This is extremely drinkable and the growler flew by. I hope 3F's makes this a regular, I would love to have this to drink during the summer months. Just when you start to wonder if 3F's can bring something new to the party, they drop this delightful treasure. 658 charactersSwiftyMcBeer, Jan 10, 2011

It pours a a pretty standard APA looking light orange, slightly hazy and a medium bone colored head. Minimal lace coats the side of the glass.
The hop presence is big and beautiful. Huge orange, grapefruit and pineapple fill my nose. It's just a tropical party of hop aromas, geared exactly to my preference. I am absolutely in love Citra hops and don't mind at all the surging popularity of them.
The flavor keeps almost the same hop intensity and adds just a touch of a malt sweetness at the end to counteract the hop bitterness.
The mouthfeel is pretty light making this APA very approachable and drinkable. 683 charactersweatherdog, Jan 10, 2011

I heard about it from a couple friends who couldn't say enough about it. I would definitely agree it is a great beer and was a nice surprise (that's a biased statement, I'm a big 3f supporter). It is a very clear light golden color. The smell is great with a very fresh hops dominance. The taste is good, and very light on the malt presence. I was expecting something closer to alpha king, but it doesn't have the richness. It's unusually smooth, light and refreshing. Definitely has a potent hops presence, with lots of citrus spice. Seems like a great session beer and would be great with some spicy food. I hope it becomes a regular. 747 charactersbheilman, Jan 08, 2011

s-nice strong citrusy aroma from the hops. sweet undertones of caramel malts. surprised by the whole burst of lemony citrus overtones.plan and simple but this is a single hopped beer.
t-citrus blast that comes through at first which was very nice. there are some undertones of a caramel malt with some light toasted qualities to it.once again simple and easy but fantastic.
m-light mouthfeel. carbonation is great. citrus over and over on the palate and long into the aftertaste. light drying on the palate from the alcohol. flavors are very well balanced with malts and hops. almost too perfect.

Beer is hazy and dark yellow with a nice head of medium and large bubbles that leaves some lacing on the glass. Carbonation is moderate to low.
Aroma is a little weaker than I had hoped but I can totally smell the tropical fruit bomb that awaits me.
Beer is relatively light in body with a very mild sweetness lead off and an explosion of hop character in the midpalate. The finish of the beer is mildly bitter but it is a wonderfully rounded beer with so much hop flavor. It's lighter than I expected and not quite as bitter but I suppose this is an APA and not an IPA, I would have more of this anytime. 764 charactersdrabmuh, Jan 06, 2011

pour was a nice light amber with a smooth capping of white foam on the top that went over quite nicely. reached around an inch in height before setting back down and leaving great streaking on the glass. aroma was one of the best i have ever come across. tons of grapefruit, so ripe and fresh with the perfect amount of sweetness to balance it, no lie i was in heaven here. sublime flavor. rich, sweet, mouth watering bitter and juicy hops dash across the tongue and just really open up as it starts to warm. just incredibly impressed here by the entire profile. light dryness and an effortless flavor. quite simply one of the best beers i have ever had by anyone, and possibly the best pale ever.

Pours a nice orange color with a two-finger head. Quite bubbly at first and eventually falls down into a light cap. Slight lacing on the edges of the glass. The nose is nice with a bit of citrus as well as the usual tropical suspects that come with a Citra brew.
The flavor really takes off on what was present in the nose. There is quite. Bit of tropical fruit, some orange, and then quite a bit of nice bitterness. Really nice how the flavor and bitterness interact here. Feel is bitter.and a bit light with really nice cabontion. Thrilled that this was still here and am very glad I got to try it.

Appearance -- Pours a bright amber hue with a finger of sudsy beige head. Exceptional lacing for an APA.
Smell -- Grapefruit pith, juicy citrus, ripe drupes, and caramel malt. The smell of Citra is unmistakable.
Taste -- Juicy tangerine, apricot, peach, and grapefruit pith stand at attention. A caramel malt backbone lets the citrusy bits sing.
Mouthfeel -- Medium body with milder carbonation. Very smooth, drinks easy.
Drinkability -- A damn tasty APA, though the single-hopping has made it a bit one-dimensional. It all depends on how much one likes Citra hops - great aromatics and fruity flavors, but is somewhat lacking in earthy bitterness to counterbalance the caramel malt sweetness that this varietal is always paired with to make those juicy citrus, apricot, and peach notes sing. All in all, absolutely worth a try. 864 charactersyeahnatenelson, Dec 19, 2010

S - Citra hops. Just pure unadulterated Citra hops - huge citrus zest, light cat pee and pine. Negligible malt character.
T - Bit citrus hop flavor, yeasty mid-palate, and a bitter finish. This is one of the few times I think a hoppy beer could use more malt character.
M - Light body, slightly gritty texture, lower carbonation. Finishes extremely dry. Was surprised to see this was 6.2% - thought it was a percent or two lower.

Poured from growler into DFH pint glass. Dark golden in color with bright off white head about a half finger thick... noticable lacing but not heavy. This beer bursts with citrus aroma including my favorites such as grapefruit and orange.. and the piney notes balance well. 
At first taste the hops hit the palate fairly square. The taste is of course fantastic with tangerine, pineapple and grapefruit being the most prominent (they call them citrahops for a reason...). Again, the tastes also reveals the pine quite nicely....
Great beer here. The carbonation is perfect, and I could sit and drink way too many of these if 3F were down the street. As much as I enjoy Alpha King, I would rate this one even higher with better drinkability. The common trait they share in my opinion is that neither really drinks like an APA, but a great IPA.

A basic looking beer. A nice light orange color. Small eggshell colored head. A decent amount of lacing left in glass.
S.
Incredible citrus smell. I'm getting grapefruit, peach, mango, orange, etc. It reminds me of a combo of Gumballhead and Dreadnaught. 
T.
Citrus hops, with a subtle bitterness. Like my previous example, almost like a cousin of Gumballhead. I could use a little bit more bitterness and malt in there, but still a decent tasting beer.
M.
About medium bodied but a little on the thin side. From the growler there could've been more carbonation. (Had this on tap earlier today which had a great amount of carbonation). Beer has a great finish however.

A - Appears amber and filtered (non-hazy) with a nice two finger head. Pretty standard appearance for an IPA or APA.
S - Incredible. Fresh, juicy, citrus hops. Not much else, but not much else is needed. 
T - This is just outstanding. A perfect combination of citrus and piney hops through out - sustained from the start to the finish. Tastes like a mixture between the biscuittiness of Gumballhead and the sharp hops of Alpha King. 
M - Appropriate for the style. Moderately carbonated with just a touch of thick elixir. 
D - Here is where this one shines. Crisp, fresh, and very easy to drink. This might just be the most drinkable beer I've ever had from FFF.

T: I absolutely love the hop profile in this beer. I haven't had any of the other beers that are made exclusively with citra hops, but this stuff is amazing. There's a bit of semi-sweet grapefruit up frunit, then some orange in the middle and the finish if of bitterness and earthiness at the finish.
M: Perfect. Nice carbonation, good viscosity, and a great aftertaste.
D: Fairly high, although the earthy/bitter aftertaste may get to be a bit much after a second glass. Still, there is great balance in this beer. Overall though, I was very impressed with this beer.
