4.24/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A: Pours an impenetrable brown with a thin cap of dark brown head that dissipates almost immediately to a thin persistent ring. 
S: Dark chocolate, a bit of cinnamon, nuts, earth, vanilla bean, light roastiness, and moderate bourbon.  
T: Very bourbon and cola forward, more so than the aroma and also not quite as complex, along roast that is overshadowed by medium sweetness, light vanilla bean, and some lingering coffee on the finish.  
M: Medium-full bodied with light carbonation.  Mild alcohol warmth but not boozy or hot.  
O: Solid effort, but a few notches below top tier.  Reminds me a bit of the less elegant BB stouts (like CW BBBW, Arcadia BA Shipwreck Porter).  Pretty bourbon and cola forward and not quite balanced enough by the vanilla or base beer. 771 characterspmarlowe, Apr 06, 2017

Smells great-wonderful mix of Bourbon barrel and vanilla with slight chocolate notes in the background. Taste is strong vanilla and mild chocolate roast with an almost perfect barrel presence-starts slightly hot with an alcohol burn, but then mellows out as the taste spreads through my mouth. Sweet, boozy, a little of the oiliness one can get from this style, just a well balanced flavorful beer. Yum! 504 charactersmschrei, Mar 22, 2017

Definitely lots of bourbon and vanilla notes, with dark chocolate in the background;  I can almost get a bit of cognac too which is surprising.   The taste is sweet and smokey.  I was expecting more vanilla, but chocolate is more dominant here with vanilla playing a supporting role. The barrel complements all of the flavors nicely to create a complex dessert of a beer.   As others have noted, it is a bit thin with more carbonation than the head would imply, but it makes it pretty smooth and drinkable rather than sitting heavy. 
Overall, it's probably the best beer of this style.  If it were more readily available, I'd drink a ton of it, but it's something I can get by with drinking 1-2 bottles of a year. 811 charactersnawpnawp, Feb 17, 2017

On its own, this is a very good barrel aged vanilla stout, perhaps the finest use of vanilla flavor in a beer that I have had (even above more hyped beers.) There are some nice chocolate and sweet vanilla notes with a mild touch of bourbon from the barrels. 
The viscosity of this beer is the only reason why it is not a more sought after release. 477 charactersrodmanfor3, Oct 24, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75yeah, this is about as good as anyone has done one of these vanilla bourbon huge stouts. its so much more vibrant on the vanilla, less boozy on the whiskey, and not anywhere near as sweet as a lot of them, despite intentionally being a sweeter stout, it has balance and resolve, and i loved every drop of it. not quite black on the pour, but a very dark almost inky looking brown, shiny and viscous, with red wine legs on the edges of the glass and a short mocha colored head. it has an intense vanilla aroma, fresh beans, like sliced and scraped pods, almost like it was added to an already finished beer, its first for sure. the oak and bourbon come next, really complimenting that vanilla aspect, but adding a little corny sweetness, toasted wood, caramel, and nutty properties to this. the roast of the malt brings coffee elements, bakers chocolate with bitterness, and finally back to the fresh vanilla, its pungent and intense and amazing. the even cooler thing as that this evolution of flavors is exactly the same in the flavor as it is in the nose, driven mostly by vanilla, intense, but oddly balanced. the wood is strong, the whiskey is flavorful without being hot, and there is a great low end here with coffee notes and balancing bitter roast and char. its also not too strong, sometimes these work their way up into the 12% abv and above range, and in my opinion thats just too much most of the time. smooth in feel, very little carbonation but none is needed. its nice to slow this down not speed it up. let in linger. an amazing complexion of flavors, huge vanilla, absolutely incredible beer. when do the bottles come out??? id love to acquire one for the cellar and share this with my friends here. tip top! 1,725 charactersStonedTrippin, Jun 23, 2016

4.06/5  rDev -9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Enjoyed out of a 22 oz bomber from Batch 3 (2016) and reviewed from notes after drinking it on 5/4/2016. Poured into an oversized brandy snifter.
Appearance (4.0) - A pitch black body topped by a fleeting half finger head that disappears almost immediately. Just pinstripe-thin ringlet of tan suds around the edge of the glass and a single dollop of film in the middle of the surface of the liquid. No lacing or legs to speak of. 
Smell (4.25) - Pretty nice aroma wafting out of the glass, with the sweetness of lactose and vanilla beans hitting my nose first, followed by some bittersweet chocolate and light bourbon caramel sweetness shortly thereafter. As it warms, the vanilla and bourbon become a little more prevalent, creating a nice sweet aroma with a pinch of astringent booze on the finish.
Taste (4.0) - I have to admit, I'm a little underwhelmed here. I know this bottle is now about four months old, but it's just not as decadent or rich as I was hoping/expecting. The flavors are all there--vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, light bitterness--but in the end it's just a good barrel-aged stout with vanilla bean. On the taste, the vanilla isn't quite as dominant as it was in the aroma, which allows the base milk stout to come through a little more, and gives the barrel-aging a little more leeway as well. Slight alcohol astringency on the finish, but overall, the taste is sweet.
Mouthfeel (4.0) - Medium body, although it seems light to my palate, given the style of beer. Carbonation is moderate to light. I think the body may be where my issues with this beer are rooted.
Overall (4.0), it is a very good beer, but I can't help but feel that it fell short of what I was looking for. I'll fully admit that my disappointment may come from chasing this beer for a year before finally happening upon a bottle in a pretty easy trade, but there are simply other vanilla bean imperial stouts (and no, I'm not talking about VR) or even porters that I'd take ahead of this one. I can think of about three off the top of my head. That said, I do want to reiterate that this is far from a bad beer. It's actually quite delicious and if someone offered me a pour or bottle in the future, or I randomly came across it on tap, I'd drink my fill and enjoy it immensely. 2,273 charactersLambicPentameter, Jun 09, 2016

4.53/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 ounce bottle into a snifter.  
Pours very dark and opaque, thick looking, with a short head and minimal lacing.  Wow.  This smells incredible.  Cocoa, vanilla, malt, light bourbon- more as it warms, chocolate.  Smells like malted milk balls.  Taste follows the nose with the cocoa and vanilla, more chocolate than the nose, malt, light bourbon, a little oak.  Pretty much tastes like malted milk balls.  Smooth, creamy, great body, well carbonated.
This is one to look for.  The vanilla is outstanding, the rest of the flavors are intense and well blended.   The bourbon was subtle in this bottle, but it still had a positive impact.  Price point was reasonable for the quality.  Will definitely buy this again. 716 charactersstortore, Jun 06, 2016

A- pours a deep black color with a bit of light creeping in on the edge, small foamy white head that leaves a few patches of lace behind  
S- charred malt up front brings aromas of chocolate, followed by burnt marshmallow, vanilla bean & sugar cookies.  Barrel notes are subtle but give aromas of bourbon, vanilla & toasted oak.  Slightly smoky close with milk sugar sweetness  
T- marshmallow and vanilla open up followed by dark chocolate and vanilla whipping cream and milk sugars.  Light barrel character gives hint of bourbon and toasted oak in the mid-palate, along with a trace of coconut.  Finishes with more marshmallow and chocolate with a sweet linger
M- medium body and low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel that continues to the finish 
O- the sweetness of the base milk stout compliments the vanilla addition very well, with the barrel character balancing the sweetness.  One of the best milk stouts that I've had to date. 989 charactersTreyliff, Mar 28, 2016

This is an incredible beer. Unlike most milk stouts it's sweet but not overly so. Bourbon reins it back and the quality vanilla likewise provides a great flavor rather than an extracty sweetness. 478 charactersHootie159, Feb 27, 2016

4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Deviating from my normal review notes because I was so captivated by @smakawhat's review - this awesome BA captured the essence of everything I thought. Batch 3 is a decadent treat and infinitely complex with its depth of vanilla, bourbon, cocoa, and marshmallow flavors. It feels lame mailing in a review like this, but I read that review and found myself agreeing with every sentence - 4 Hands should pay royalties for tasting notes! 
For what it's worth, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Too many bourbon barrel-aged stouts get overpowered by a jarring alcohol taste and this batch of Madagascar deftly avoids that and presents a refined and nuanced flavor profile that keenly plays on a rich milk stout complemented by robust chocolate and vanilla notes. A phenomenal brew for sure.
TL;DR:  This is a glorious bourbon-soaked s'more replete with milk chocolate and sweet marshmallow flavors. Do everything in your power to get a bottle! 940 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 07, 2016

4.83/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle into a large snifter glass.  Vintage 2015.
Deep walnut brown body with a hint of clarity around the edges.  Small basic tan head, with little retention and can't quite make a finger.  Settles to a creamy but even bubbles collar, and a little bit of lacing.
Aroma is quite impressive.  Huge thick chocolate notes, and Duncan Hines cake batter.  There's a hint of coffee roast in here, a bit of char as well as the roast character really pipes out just a little bit as well.  Extremely impressive nose, with a bit of powder cocoa mixing in as well.  Like a warm inviting bakers chocolate cake even with the matching icing, and a small cup of coffee.  Very impressive.
One word.  Wow.  Where do I start?  For a brew that seems to be fairly straightforward this is incredibly diverse on the palate.  Thick rich and balanced, the light bodied quality opens up tremendously on first sip.  Coffee light acid then a thick mixing cake like milk chocolate and vanilla sweetness fills the palate.  Blasting char roast on the finish, and even in the mid palate as well, with some great amounts of dry roast porter like tones, and coffee bean grinds.  Nice wonderful toned lactose sweetness with cream and vanilla complimenting perfectly, each of these roast, dry, sweet, and chocolate notes are just all paired together wonderfully.  Aftertaste takes more of the sweetness away perfectly, almost cigar breath and coffee like quality.  Oaky whiskey notes really seem to have just sat in the dust and given all their power to the other elements in sweetness and vanilla.  There's no booze on this whatsoever either.
This doesn't even taste like a milk stout, and it's absolutely flooring.  Drinks so incredibly easily, a great creation. 1,749 characterssmakawhat, Feb 05, 2016

Dark (but not pitch black) appearance, no foam head.  Just a nice ring around the edge as you drink.  Load of vanilla smell.  Very vanilla forward and loads of marshmallow beat up the palate with a smooth ending.  Bourbon note is there but not overpowering.  The taste and feel is really dominated by vanilla.  Overall a great stout, and one of the better vanilla ones out there.  Would happily drink again, if I could ever find it. 457 characterseifster82, Jan 31, 2016

Pours deep mahogany. Head is minuscule and soon disappears.
Nose is gracefully complex. Rich, deep vanilla that is not overwhelming. I must disclose vanilla as a dominant note tends to be a negative for me, but this one is rounded and smooth, yet ever present. Also, gentle bourbon, hints of cocoa, and maybe marshmallow. 
Taste is sublime. Like the nose, the vanilla is a constant yet it sashays with numerous partners. The cocoa is the strongest, and alludes to deep buttery brownies. The bourbon takes turns, especially in the swallow, bringing sweetness infused with slight char. And marshmallow hovers and retreats and taps in shyly. Madagascar is gently "warm." No burn, just a warn hug to the back of the mouth. The flavors really go back and forth. As it warms, the bourbon approaches parity with the cocoa. 
Mouthfeel is perfect, creamy yet some heft.
Glorious Drink. 932 characters2beerdogs, Jan 16, 2016

T: big vanilla, then slight bourbon.  This is fantastic!  
F: very smooth, supremely drinkable for a ba stout.  Medium thickness and better than average coating.
O: this is a ba vanilla imperial milk stout, and my best comparison is this is vanilla rye's little brother.  It's a fantastic beer, a real treat for sure. 474 charactersyesterdayfaraway, Jan 12, 2016

Big vanilla on the nose.  Not as medicinal as VR, but about the same level - Vanilla turned to 11, but not much else from the base beer.
Big thump of Vanilla milk shake, then nothing.  No barrel, no base beer, just vanilla
Thin, almost watery mouthfeel even when at room temp
Overall I put this in the same category as Funky Buddha adjunct stouts - really nice, if you are into the kapow! over the top adjunct flavor, but that is all you are getting.  Huge nose, but not much else to back it up 579 characterspagriley, Jan 09, 2016

Aroma of vanilla, cocoa and bourbon.
Tasted of cocoa, marshmallow, vanilla, bourbon and oak. Some boozy warmth in the finish from the 9.3% abv.
Medium/Full bodied and creamy with a lighter carbonation.

Look - Motor oily thick and extremely impressive lacing for a 9% milk stout.  This is a quite nice start to this beer.
Smell - vanilla marshmallow at the forefront.  Also some nice notes of chocolate and cocoa with a little bit of roast, toffee, and coffee as well.
Taste - love this.  The vanilla is excellent but not overpowering.  The bourbon really comes out more and more as it warms, but the balance continues to get better and better.  The oak comes out nicely after a little warming too.  Some sweet dark chocolate adds to the mix, but nothing overly complex.  A very enjoyable mix of flavors.
Feel - very creamy.  Not super thick, but this goes down very easily with minimal booze.  A little heavy on the carbonation, but impacts more as it goes down and not on the flavor profile.
Overall - a great beer.  Had this at FOBAB and sought out some bottles from this release and extremely glad I did.  It's certainly no FO or VR, but it's a very strong vanilla stout and I will seek this one out annually.  Love 4 Hands more and more every beer I try of theirs! 1,134 charactersrabbott2, Dec 30, 2015

A: Black body, reddish highlights; half-inch head of dense tan foam; decent retention, good lace. Attractive.
S: Plenty of vanilla, but it's not overpowering or one-note. There's also substantial chocolate, bourbon, and oak. Really nice.
T: Follows the nose: sweet vanilla up front, rich barrel character closing things out with caramel, bourbon, and toasty oak. Long, bittersweet finish with lingering vanilla and dark chocolate. Tasty.
M: Not too thick, not too thin. Moderate carbonation.
O: Excellent beer, but not as memorable as it might have been. At least it wasn't as cloying as some other vanilla stouts I've had.

4.07/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4A- This beer hits the glass in a thick, black pour that kind of looks and feels like chocolate milk. A small head of about a centimeter forms and is medium tan in color. Most of the head ends up sticking around a good while and leaving a solid amount of lacing on the glass.
S- Sweet lactose sugar and chocolate greet the nose first on the beer. Just a hint of vanilla sweetness mixes in next before the barrels lend their flavors to the scent. The oak and char are more prominent on the end of the smell. Overall impression of the scent of the beer is sweet upfront with balancing burnt malts and barrel on the back end.
T- The beer starts you off with a mildly bitter bang of burnt malts and chocolate right up front. The semi-sweet nature of the chocolate takes over for a brief moment before the barrel characteristics move in and give a bit of oak and char spiciness. Right after the barrel on the very end of the drink, the vanilla sweetness kicks in more noticeably. The lingering flavor on the tongue is what I imagine licking the inside of a bourbon barrel to be like, with spicy char and oak mixing in with vanilla sweetness.
M- Thick and creamy is the best way to describe this milk stout. The lactose sweetness in the beer lends itself to thickening the flavor up and making the body heavy and smooth. Outside of the bourbon barrel flavors, there is no detectable alcohol or warmth to be had.
Overall, this beer feels like it should when you drink it, but the flavors are a little less than I was expecting. The vanilla is definitely a subtle flavor that mixes with the barrel and malts rather than being a standout flavor. This is a very good imperial sweet stout, but I was hoping for something a little stronger in the vanilla department. 1,757 charactersboilermakerbrew, Aug 23, 2015

4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Tried this at Great Taste of the Midwest.  Tons of vanilla in the aroma and flavor. Taste is slightly boozey, but there is a lot of vanilla here. Medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. The beer feels a little thin on the pallete and the booziness makes it feel a little bigger so they kinda cancel each other out.  Glad to try this at a festival. Hype train is going on this beer. 387 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 10, 2015

One of the few "dessert beers" with this flavor profile, it definitely impressed. 241 charactersTastyIsBeer, Aug 09, 2015

Tastes good? Solid. I think the vanilla is a bit overly sweet and it leaves a sticky sweet, somewhat medicinal taste in the finish. Nice bourbon heat and a great thick, mouthfeel. But... Solid. Not exceptional. 407 charactersZaximus, Jul 31, 2015

  Wow, just wow. This beer is off the chain complex. The vanilla is very apparent, but not cloying.      Lots of roasted character, with a big chocolate and coffee punch.   And sure,  the bourbon is there, but it blends nicely with the other flavors.  The finish is velvety smooth.    Despite being over 9%, the alcohol is virtually undetectable.
 As Kevin explained to me, " we buy the best  vanilla beans we can get.  And we skin, disinfect and split every bean by hand before it goes in to the fermenter".    The attention to detail and dedication to perfection is mind blowing. World Class? Oh Yeah! 765 characterscrazyfoMostout, Apr 11, 2015

This one pours a fairly dark black, with no real head or lacing, maybe a few spots here and there.
Smells so richly, strongly, and wonderfully of vanilla beans, there's a ton here, clearly. I also get chocolate and bourbon tones pretty strongly.
I think this one possibly beats out Vanilla Rye. It's got a less syrupy, molasses-like flavor, and more just pure vanilla and barrel character. There's some oak, chocolate, and bourbon, but the main story is all about the vanilla. Delicious.
This is thick bodied, but not syrupy in the mouthfeel, luckily. There's a lower level of carbonation, and a really nice drinkability.
This was definitely one of the stars of the weekend, super tasty. 721 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 23, 2015

Milk chocolate, lactose and soft bourbon. The flavor is pungent vanilla. Genuine vanilla bean. Creamy milk chocolate candy bar. Milky lactose. The bourbon character really rounds out the flavor well. This one isnt necessarily the most complex and that's fine when you really nail the intended flavors. You want vanilla, bourbon and chocolate? Here it is. Actually now that I think about it, this was a pretty complex beer so I retract that previous statement. Nice, creamy feel. One of the best EBF beers I tried. 605 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 22, 2015

A: Pours a rich black color with over a finger of khaki head that reduces slowly and leaves a thin collar.  Lacing is minimal.  Viscosity seems right no par at just below 10%.
S: I get vanilla up front as the most dominant.  Bourbon next, with just a slight bit of coffee.  The chocolate gets lost in the mix.  I'm a huge vanilla anything fan, so I really enjoy the aroma of this beer.
T: Vanilla up front which drives a very sweet flavor, with the bourbon coming in right at the end to leave a semi sweet and semi dry after flavor.  Again, coffee and chocolate are more afterthoughts.  As the glass warms I pick up a bit more chocolate notes, but not it is still a complementary flavor to the vanilla.
M: So creamy.  Carbs is low, which lends to just how creamy this beer is.  Slightly dry on the end, attributed to bourbon.  Yet enough sweetness that the dryness is very mellow. 
O: Granted not a lot of Milk Stouts are barrel aged, this is easily the best Milk Stout I've had to date.  The vanilla and bourbon additions are very welcomed, I only wish that the coffee made it through more - a possible sign of not having fresh.  I love this beer, and love even more that a fairly unknown brewery can nail a style like that and redefine what a Milk Stout can be. 1,311 charactersroger617, Mar 12, 2015

Aroma brings it with the vanilla.  A lot going on, but bottom line there a tantalizing marriage between the bourbon, oak, and vanilla beans.  The vanilla just smells so pure and so damn good!  I'm usually let down with the flavors of vanilla stouts that smell divine as they can come off as too artificial, but not the case here.  Delicate, refined, smooth, balanced, and in no way artificial.  Hint of bitterness on the back end ties everything together.  Body is light, yet creamy.  So freaking drinkable. 
Overall...incredible.  A harmony of natural vanilla and bourbon barrels that is on another level and matched by very few.

4.43/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The comparison to Vanilla Rye is inevitable but I think a bit misguided. We're talking about a 9.3% milk stout versus an almost 14% imperial stout. Cue up the comments of "Madagascar is too thin" ... absurd considering the impressively creamy, almost marshmallowy body, close to perfect for the style. And, again, comments "needs more bourbon" ... when the bourbon marries perfectly with the beer and serves to highlight the incredible vanilla flavor rather than overwhelming it, which would turn this into a souped up version of vanilla extract. 
If there is one "critique" I have it's that the base beer does get a touch lost under the vanilla. But, then, perhaps it's just married so closely that the two become indistinguishable. The purest expression of real vanilla I've come across in a beer. I'd love to see them amp up the base a bit to an imperial version and give it the same treatment.
(B1 review; subsequent batches haven't quite impressed me as much.) 967 charactersKurmaraja, Feb 21, 2015

Vanilla Rye wins a head to head vs Madagascar but this is very very good. Not enough bourbon and kind of thinner than I expected. Lots of sweet vanilla smell and flavor. This would be fantastic if bourbon barrel aged for a longer time to give it more barrel flavor. 319 charactersGetalegup, Feb 17, 2015

A- Dark brown body, opaque and close to being pitch black. One finger offwhite head, nice retention, no lacing.
S- Vanilla ice cream. Seriously, this smells like authentic vanilla with a nice dose of bourbon and lactose. Some milk chocolate sweetness, a small bit of oak. Sweet smelling enough but not over the top. This is perfectly beyond what I expected it to be, and I knew its reputation going into this. Wow, the vanilla balance in this is perfect. Surprised there wasn't more barrel in this, but honestly, I really don't care- it adds more vanilla to the overall flavour than anything else.
F- Vanilla ice cream flavour, milk chocolate, a bit of roasted malt, slight espresso, slight smoky bourbon flavour. This is phenomenal and drinking better then BCBVR is right now. Perfect amount of vanilla that is genuine and not extract-like at all.
M- Medium bodied, nice silkiness and moderately creamy; does not reach the mouthfeel of BCBVR but not a lot of beers do, anyway. Drinks great, easy to drink and zero heat.
O- This beer is drinking better than BCBVR is right now, and reminds me a lot of aged BCBVS. It hits that sweet spot of perfect vanilla goodness without being boozy at all. Seek this one with prejudice! 1,345 charactersStevedore, Feb 14, 2015

The aroma has milk chocolate, bourbon, and liquor. There is some faint vanilla notes after swirling the glass.
The taste starts with big vanilla notes nicely combined with a little bourbon. The finish has lots of milk chocolate and a little charred barrel.
The feel is a solid medium with some slickness.
Overall this is a very enjoyable BA vanilla stout. None of the flavors are cloying, but the vanilla is definitely pronounced. Luckily the backing flavors of chocolate and bourbon are able to come through on the finish. The question of aging always comes up and I feel like I must strongly recommend against. Drink this now, because there is no alcohol to mellow and no flavors to subdue. 781 charactersTotallyHosed, Feb 03, 2015

I haven't had some of the big BA vanilla beers (BCBVS, BAVDL, etc.), but of those that I've had, including Vanilla Rye BCS, this is probably the best. The taste of vanilla bean is very strong in the beer, and the combination of barrel-aging + vanilla give the beer a really pleasant creaminess, without any sort of bitterness or alcohol heat. Great stuff. 374 charactersSeanBond, Feb 01, 2015

22oz bottle poured into a Jester King Teku
A - Shiny black color, minimal white/tan foam head, minimal to media lacing, good ring retention 
S - Huge vanilla nose upfront followed by milky chocolate and hints of coffee and bourbon on the back end. Really decadent vanilla and chocolate though
T - Taste follows the nose here, huge amount of vanilla chocolate and coffee up front, highly drinkable with a touch of bourbon on the back end. The 9+% makes this relatively easy to drink and crushable. Vanilla is definitely the dominating taste here. 
M - Mouthfeel is actually pretty full, smooth creamy light mouthfeel that drinks smooth
O - 4 Hands hit a homer with this beer. Really nailed what a vanilla stout can be, there aren't too many vanilla BA stouts out there that go toe to toe with this one, looking at you 2010 BCBVS. Cant wait to do a side by side with this and 2014 Vanilla Rye 1,007 charactersdrmcleod10, Dec 31, 2014

Aroma is vanilla first and then bourbon and milk chocolate.
Dominant flavor is vanilla followed by bourbon.  Some chocolate and heavy cream.  Mild sweetness which increased as the beer warmed.  Very smooth drinking and alcohol seems less than the listed 9.3%.
Has the traditional creamy feel of a milk stout though not as thick as some I've had.  Low carbonation.
Overall, an outstanding beer which is drinkable enough to get you in trouble at 9.3%.  I had 1 22oz bomber and could have easily gone for another. 632 charactersleroybrown10, Dec 31, 2014

4.18/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Imperial milk stout aged in bourbon barrels with vanilla beans
The beer pours a dark black (not inky/oily) and has a razor thin head of tightly packed small tan bubbles that fades into nothing quickly. The nose has vanilla sweetness upfront, dessert like, with some chocolate and bourbon in the background, maybe some donuts too (?). It seems a little biting and spicy, but it's predominantly overpowered by the beer's lactose sweetness. The taste has a smooth, chocolatey sweetness upfront followed by a woody, caramel, and (slight) booze in the finish. The beer has a medium-heavy body, not as thick as expected, bold vanilla and lactose, with more subtle barrel characteristics, very little carbonation, masked booze, and is rounded and drinkable. This is a solid offering from 4 hands, reasonably priced, but disappointed with the limited production...would definitely drink again. 885 charactersThePorterSorter, Feb 15, 2014
