L: dark brown/black, mocha colored head that stuck around a bit then slowly faded.
S: Holy sh#*, I wish they made perfume that smelled like this. I'd buy it for my wife. Actually, probably a good thing they don't.
T: Indescribable. A little boozy (I put the bottle back in the fridge for round 2 and that helped a little), coffee was pronounced but not overdone. A very nice example of the style.
F: Creamy, not over carbonated but there was some carbonation there (not so much that you felt it, but it was there)

4.5/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Using the spicy, earthy and robust delight of Vietnamese coffee, the intense yearly stout of AleSmith sees greater heights.
Vietnamese Coffee infused Speedway Stout pours much like any other in the series- with a jet black opaqueness and with a creamy mocha froth. Its scent however is bolder than ever with the strong overtones of dark roast coffee along with the same molasses, dark chocolate and natural coffee character that's common to the standard stout. Burnt marshmallows and espresso roll onto the tongue as its roasty cream, chocolate, coffee and black walnut maltiness intimidates the senses with the very first sip.
The middle palate shows more of a coffee balanced tilt as the malt sweetness slowly lifts and the coffee and roasted grain character starts to saturate the tastebuds fully. Creamy roast borrows a silkiness from heavy whipping cream with hints of vanilla and smoky char. Earthiness of coffee presents a spicy soil character similar to turkish coffee and black pepper. Baker's chocolate and walnut offer a brownie-like taste even as the finish comes in drier and toastier than initially thought.
Full bodied, lavish and full, the beer's creamy upstart is broken on the finish with the spice and earth of coffee along with the sharp alcohol warmth and a certain roast derived astringency- all helping to dry the palate and create a sense of drinkability beyond relegating the stout as only a sipping after dinner beer. 1,446 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 17, 2017

Jet black with a light, brown head.
Excellent nose, bursting with coffee, chocolate and vanilla. 
The taste is huge! Sweet and roasted, with so much coffee and chocolate it feels like I'm drinking a cake. Pretty much no alcohol, and some terrific vanilla notes in the finish.
Mouthfeel is just right, thick and oily, but not overly so. 
Alesmth is my favorite brewery, and this is another great take on the Speedway. Huge in both smell and taste, it ticks every box I want a stout to tick. I want more.... 546 charactersJamFuel, Feb 05, 2017

Appearance: Color is jet black. Moderate amount of bubbles and a solid finger of tan head that settles into a thin creamy layer. 
Smell: A very roasty and rich dark malt driven aroma with a scent of coffee beans and chocolate. Big upfront scent of Vietnamese coffee beans. Dark roasted malt notes of dark chocolate, toast, biscuit, caramel, nuts, and smoke with yeast. Sweet scent of molasses and vanilla. Subtle hints of dark fruit. A really great roasty aroma. 
Taste: Like it smells, a roasty and rich dark malt driven taste with notes of coffee beans and chocolate. Big upfront taste of roasted Vietnamese coffee beans. Dark roasted malt notes of dark chocolate, toast, smoke, biscuit, and nuts with yeast. Sweet taste of molasses and vanilla. Light undertones of dark fruit and tobacco. A really great taste. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nicely roasty and chewy. Very smooth for a 12% beer without feeling thin. Alcohol is hidden very well. 
Overall: A really great Coffee Imperial Stout. Great Vietnamese bean and chocolate flavor with a perfect balance of roast bitterness and sweetness. 1,203 charactersMattyG85, Jan 19, 2017

Smells of sweet cold brew coffee, lots of milk chocolate and just a little hint of roast. Molasses and spicy licorice mingle into this foundation, producing a milk chocolate powder aroma.
Has a thinner, velvet mouthfeel, with flavors ranging from sweet to dry, without a lot of nuances in between, tied together by a lower carbonation. 
Tastes of rock sugar and hot chocolate, molasses, surprisingly thin on the palate, with a slowly evolving coffee dryness. Once the coffee takes over, this begins to taste interesting, bringing flavors of dried herbs, earth, wood bark and sugared espresso beans to the palate, pungent and harmonious. Finishes bitter, bready and rustic, with its initial silkness.
If it wasn't for the thin mouthfeel, with just a little more complexity to it, the beer could become mighty fine. As it stands, there is quite a bit unused potential to be found in here. 953 charactersaleigator, Jan 15, 2017

A - Pours black with a thick tan head.
S - Aroma is very muted, just a little coffee.
T - This might be the smoothest, least bitter coffee stout I've had. The coffee flavor, and a bit of chocolate, is perfectly integrated into the stout.
M - below average carbonation, above average thickness. Very smooth mouth feel.
O - This is an excellent, well balanced coffee stout. 429 charactersspacecake9, Jan 02, 2017
4.49/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a growler via The Growler Stop in Newtown served in a snifter.
This beefy beast pours an rich obsidian with a nice head of light brown 
foam that settles to a thick ring, thin pool, and features nice sudsy lacing.
Nose of rich cocoa, decadent coffee, dark sweet malts, subtle char, sweet
booze, and subtle char notes.  Flavors nail the WOW factor.  Delicious 
rich coffee notes coalesce with dark bakers chocolate and mild cream notes
awash in heavy booze and dark sweet malts to balance out the bakers chocolate
with touches of char.  Excellent mouth feel; smooth as velvet, rich, subtle cream,
light carbonation, and a bitter malt and coffee aftertaste.  
Overall-----I think I am in love.
Thanks to the Growler Stop for some decadent fresh beer!

I love AleSmith, but reg Speedway has never done it for me, and Vietnamese, while tasty enough, sadly follows suit. A bit of dark fruit alongside the dark, roasty notes of the coffee, decent body, a bit wet, not coating, touch of nuttiness in the finish. Again, a perfectly respectable coffee stout, but I still just can't figure out what everyone else is getting in Speedway(s) that I'm missing. 499 charactersbreadwinner, Dec 28, 2016

It's dark, with a nice head, and huge lacing that completely coats the glass all the way down, and lasts and lasts.  The aroma is coffee, as you would expect, no surprises here.  The taste is an excellent balance of wonderful coffee with traditional stout flavors (dark roasted malts).  Unlike some folks here, I'm not noticing chocolate.  It's pretty much a coffee stout all the way, and that's just fine with me.  Surprisingly enough, the 12% ABV isn't noticeable.  Uh-oh. 493 charactersVashonGuy, Dec 01, 2016

Black with a dark brown head, this looks solid. Big, creamy coffee with moderate sweetness, dark chocolate bitterness, mild hops. Heavy roast. Mildly oily, creamy, and for a first with Speedway, a little unctuous and flabby. Solid beer, though I prefer the base beer. 285 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 06, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served on tap.  Pours a gorgeous pitch black color with a 1 finger mocha head.  The nose is bittersweet chocolate with a hint of cream.  Vietnamese coffee notes are present on the nose.  The palate is analogous to speedway stout, but with a sweeter cream-and-coffee-like undercurrent.  An impressive Vietnamese Coffee note is present in the palate that, while not overpowering, accents the outstanding base beer beautifully.  The mouthfeel is appropriately thick - much in line with the original Speedway.
A perfect example of a measured variant.  AleSmith does an incredible job building off of an exceptional foundation without unduly distorting it.  This beer is distinct from Speedway Stout - not better, not worse - a worthy equal. 737 charactersLAp, Oct 22, 2016

4.22/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On-tap at Surly Goat served in a tulip.
Impenetrable blackness with a cap of khaki foam that leaves nice specs of lacing behind.
Smells just like dark chocolate covered espresso beans, dark roasted malts, hints of vanilla.
Taste is much of the same.  Dark chocolate covered espresso with toasty malt and sweet vanilla.  Really clean and concentrated flavors, very little alcohol presence.  Minimal astringency, and just the slightest touch of salty minerality.  Basically a chocolate and coffee in beer form.
Mouthfeel is big and bold.  Low to medium carbonation. Alcohol hides itself very well.  Big, but not heavy.
Overall this is similar to the original Speedway Stout with some additional sweetness, which must be from the different coffee in this variety. 765 charactersbillshmeinke, Oct 08, 2016

jet black in color, with brown head.  very nice coffee aroma - earthy herbal notes, not just all roast.   taste is dark chocolate, espresso, a little nuttiness. a bit acidic.   medium bodied, could be a little thicker.  overall a very nice coffee imperial stout. 290 charactersjmdrpi, Oct 02, 2016

Incredible on the palate. It starts roasty and boozy, but quickly becomes a liquid coffee-infused dark chocolate bar.
Full bodied, but not quite chewy.
Speedway Stout is one of the true benchmarks of the style; this variant truly raises it up another notch. Tremendous brew! 325 charactersRoguer, Sep 29, 2016
4.5/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Just when you think Speedway can;t get much better, the addition of the Vietnamese coffee elevates it further.  The thing I love about Vietnamese coffee is it's intense dark roastiness but not in a bitter or burned kind of way but a slightly sweeter, more chocolatly/Oreo kind of way.  Being in Houston I'm no stranger to Vietnamese coffee, and this beer is certainly a great representation of how delicious that coffee can be. 427 charactersWayne17, Sep 28, 2016

Pours an opaque black with half a fingers khaki creamy head, that sticks around and has minimal spotty lacing. Very nice looking. 
Smells of dark roasted malts, cocoa nibs, very creamy fresh coffee, hazelnut and sweetness. Maybe some fudge brownie as well. smell is very balanced and creamy. super fresh coffee. great smelling. 
Taste of Dark roasted malts, Dark chocolate, very fresh and creamy coffee, some hazelnut and a very balanced sweetness. Chocolate fudge and maybe a tad of oak. great tasting beer.

The nose is toasty with plenty of coffee. The mouthfeel is full and sticky and the roasted malt in the flavor profile is deep and hearty.
The alcohol pokes through a bit too obtrusively on the finish but that is a small gripe.
By far, the best Speedway variant that I have had the pleasure of sampling. 434 characters57md, Sep 26, 2016

Still, this was a nice experience.  Typical Speedway look.  Smell is classic SS, nougat, roasted dark malts, slight smoke, sweet brown sugar.  The Viet coffee makes this one jump off the page with coffee flavor.  It feels like you are chewing on some high quality beans.  The coffee element is almost dank, sticky, semisweet, super resiny coffee.  Taste follows.  I may have to fo back tomorrow for further inspection if this is still flowing.  Good stuff.  My first Speedway variant!  Hope I can try them all. 606 charactersChcshammonde, Sep 23, 2016

On tap at Rustico Ballston. Poured into a small snifter.
I drank both the regular and the Vietnamese side by side. Almost two different beers. 
The Vietnamese version is easily my pick between the two. Less bitter than the regular as there is more sweetness. That said and even though I like it so much the Vietnamese may still be a bit too sweet. 4.25
A - Pours a pitch black with a thin beige head. 4.25
S - A lot of chocolate. Maybe a bit too much. 4
T - Toasty malts, dark chocolate, rich, lots of coffee, average bitterness balanced by the sweetness of the malts. A hint of cinnamon or other heat-like spice. 4.5
MF - Heavy bodied, slick with a semi dry finish. 4.5 1,276 charactersSludgeman, Sep 08, 2016

A: Served a very dark coffee brown, near black, with a very thick and dense cap of creamy dark tan colored foam that took forever and a day to fade into a dense quarter inch of foam. The head is so thick it looks like melted coffee ice-cream, and it left sheets of lacing down the glass with every sip. 
S: Rich Vietnamese coffee on the nose with hints of vanilla and a touch of chocolate and roast. There's a slight earthy raisin scent as well from the coffee. 
T: Huge Vietnamese coffee flavor up front and throughout along with hints of thick chocolate syrup and fudge bringing up the rear. Potent and very rich flavors but very smooth and easy to drink with less coffee bitterness than many coffee stouts on the market. Smooth and slightly sweet coffee lingers in the aftertaste long after the swallow. Nice spicy complexity to the coffee, and a bit more depth than regular coffee beers.. 
M: Extremely thick body with a chewy mouthfeel and creamy and smooth carbonation. Drinks very well overall with a mouthfeel of a beer with half the alcohol. I'm not getting even the slightest bit of alcohol warmth. Very smooth. 
O: Better than the original, with more depth and spice to the coffee flavor. Overall an exceptional coffee stout. 1,264 charactersscottfrie, Aug 22, 2016

Look, smell, taste, a whole lot of Speedway Stout. Less bitter perhaps? Not sure as it's been awhile. Got some sweetness and vanilla, but again, not sure how much that distinguishes this from the regular. 275 charactersONovoMexicano, Jun 11, 2016

L: Onyx and deep jet black hues with a generous sandy/cinnamon head that provides ample lacing
S: Rich and decadent coffee on the nose with subdued hints of toffee and caramel
T: A huge requisite wave of complex dark roasted coffee subsides into welcomed bitter dark chocolate, hazelnut, and cocao notes that finishes with a mild espresso flare
F: Silky and moderately chewy mouthfeel - not quite as thick as BAVSS, but a healthy medium bodied mouthfeel with minimal carbonation
O: This is an excellent coffee stout. Despite being about 1.5 years old the coffee flavor profile is still robust and well integrated. Overall this was a pleasant Speedway variant and certainly a standout amongst coffee stouts. 718 charactersFireman_RK, Apr 28, 2016

Drove out of my way after seeing Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Speedway Stout was on tap downtown at Monkey Paw. Turns out it was just the regular version. Still might have made the trip regardless. Really looking forward to this one as the taster I tried over the summer at AleSmith was really good.
Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of dark, khaki tan, frothy head when I got it. Great amount of circular spiderwweb lacing on the sides of the glass. Above average retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 4.25)
Smelled dark espresso, toffee, caramel, chocolate milk, smooth coffee malts, dark chocolate and some cocoa. (Smell - 4.25)
Tasted smooth chocolate, roasted coffee beans, so much smoother than the Kona variant, Mudslide cocktail, vanilla, dark espresso, chocolate milk, hot chocolate, cocoa syrup, caramel and toffee. Tasted nowhere near 12 percent alcohol. (Taste - 4.75)
Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.50)
This was just as good as I hoped with a full review. Can’t wait to try the barrel-aged version. Probably my favorite Speedway Stout variant, although I need to try a non-hot BBA version. (Overall - 4.50)

A - Very dark, chalkboard dark, there must be carbonation in there because a lovely mocha cap resides.
S - Coffee, dark chocolate, heavy roast notes, a sharp edge to the nose, a bit of alcohol rises with time.
T - Bakers chocolate, cold brew coffee, not very subtle here, a big presence. In time warming the palate 
relents to some darker fruits and more coffee, 
M- Full in body, delightful oily complete submission cannot be resisted.
O - A beautiful big stout, the coffee variant was a bit spicy, surprisingly dry and quite a nice match.

Pours a brownish black with a thin layer of cream-colored head that mostly, but never fully, dissipates.   Nose is roasty deliciousness, with hints of dark chocolate and some booziness as it warmed.    Taste is heavier on the chocolate than the nose, plenty of roasted coffee.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin,  carbonation fine, and the finish slightly bitter and hot from the ABV.  Tasty brew indeed, but I like the Hammerhead slightly better. 488 charactersjakecattleco, Mar 19, 2016

Not a beer that disappointed at all, it was strong & dark with coffee & vanilla balanced well. It was silky smooth & went down easy for the strength whilst still having a nice kick to it. Full bodied & filling but very enjoyable; I'm looking forward to trying the original even more now. 341 charactersflyingpig, Mar 01, 2016

Served up an inky black color with a thick pillow of tan foam on the surface.  Aroma is dark chocolate forward, a tad syrupy like I find the regular version to be...hazelnut coffee, vanilla cream, molasses, and bread crust.  Flavor is coffee and cream, dark roasted malt goodness, cocoa, and an initial woody spice that decreases as it warms.  Not super coffee forward, but certainly has a mocha-like quality.  Light berry fruitiness and vanilla sweetness.  Surprisingly not too sweet or boozy though - not boozy at all in fact, which is impressive.  Pretty heavy feeling and very soft with some lingering bitter roast.  Good stuff - especially as it warms up. 673 characterswedge, Feb 17, 2016

I don't find much of a difference between this beer and its original, but both beers are exceptional. In addition to Bourbon County and all of its varieties, I think Speedway and all of its respective varieties are defining beers within this style. Dark, robust, smooth, silky, and loaded with coffee and chocolate, you can never go wrong with either of these beers. 472 charactersBiggtriksta, Jan 12, 2016

Beer poured black with a beautiful brown head that is leaving lacing behind.
Nose is coffee forward with notes of chocolate and roasted malts.
Taste is very good.  Coffee comes forward as the beer warms towards room temperature.  Dark chocolate along with the roasted malts provide a wonderful base line.  Hopping is sufficient enough to provide an IPA dry like finish.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth.
Overall this is a wonderful brew, definitely worth the price of admission! 574 charactersarizcards, Jan 09, 2016

Rich bourbon barrel aromas with lots of vanilla sweetness on the nose.  Coffee is noticeable but understated.
On palate more of the same pronounced coffee but not overpowering, rich sweetness from the barrels,  Rich and roasty but hoppy for a stout which balances the sweetness.
Really plush smooth mouthfeel. 384 charactersZonk, Jan 07, 2016

Looks like a good imperial stout - thick, viscous, black with a small tan head that fades quickly. Nothing special there. Smell is very subdued coffee and sweet chocolate with no alcohol presence at all. Stronger coffee and chocolate taste than smell. Significant alcohol burn on the swallow, but not too distracting. Mouthfeel is as expected from watching it poured - thick and creamy but with a strong burning finish. Overall I think this beer is well balanced but mild in flavor of coffee and any other notes that should be present in a beer like this. It's fantastic as an imperial stout, but my expectations were maybe too high. I'm left wanting more complexity and more flavor. I would certainly buy a bottle if it were on the shelves, though! It's definitely good. 837 charactersNominoe, Dec 21, 2015

Smells like coffee ice cream.
No bitterness or fruitiness whatsoever, just straight up old school coffee at first. Then amazingly delicious vanilla and chocolate come forward somehow. A huge roasted malt presence arises as it warms.
Creamy as fuck. This is so damn smooth. Where does the alcohol go?! Don't worry, even if you don't notice, someone else will shortly after you finish a glass of this. 471 charactersSabtos, Dec 20, 2015
5/5  rDev +12.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at Lake and Irving. L: A pitch black pour supports a long lasting, tight, finely bubbled light tan foam cap that clings to the side of the glass. 
S: Rich coffee aromas dominate with traces of bourbon, hints of chocolate, vanilla and rich malts. 
T: This is a much more luscious drink than the regular Speedway Stout. Layers of Vietnamese coffee, Bourbon, oak, alcohol and malt flavors all play very well together. 
F: It has an incredibly creamy texture. There is alcohol warming but it is mild. The carbonation is very soft. 
O: This is an extraordinary beer with nothing harsh or overstated. 609 characterspat61, Dec 20, 2015

4.31/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25On tap at the Buzz Hive in Santa Barbara.
Look: super deep brown, with a light brown head that disappears but leaves good pacing. 
Smell: pretty mild, but chocolate and fruit is evident.
Taste: initial taste is pretty harsh, to be honest. Almost burnt, and very bitter. But after that passes, considerable depth comes out. Tons of fruit, including more citrusy fruit. Also chocolate, nutmeg, roast.  As it warms, cherry/raspberry really starts to assert. 
Feel: thick, chewy, fairly dry.
Overall: the complexity that emerges as this warms is great. It's a sipper, but the alcohol is well masked. Not sure it quite lives up to its reputation, but definitely quite good. 673 charactersneurobot01, Dec 19, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25A - growler from vintage estate in Boardman Ohio poured into a snifter. Thick and geletanous looking very, very dark brown with thin mocha head. The head is frothy but not perculating and fizzing like most beers, this may have something to do with it coming from a growler. Lacing is thick and very uniform. No "sags" in it.
S - a ton of coffee and a ton of alcohol on the nose. Very, very roasty smelling. Slight charred notes. Overall smells very sweet and milky.
T - excellent beer. But immediately not congruent with the hype to me. Taste like the nose. Maybe more like burnt coffee than just coffee though (which I'm actually a fan of with beer). Heavy, heavy alcohol comes through. Finally it finishes more bitter than expected.  I'm not sure of the ibus but this one seems >50 which is just about my cutoff of where I enjoy high abv beers.
M - they knocked it out of the park here. This beer is creamier than heavy whipping creme and thicker than a girl locked in with a freezer full of hagen dazs. If I could rate this beer 5.5/5 here I would.
Overall - quite good... but is the hype warranted? It has some great attributes to it but is this really better than a regular founders breakfast stout? For some it may be and I respect their taste. However for me, this is not world class beer and seems more a product of limited supply that has produced over zealous appreciation. 1,387 charactersrypkr, Dec 11, 2015

A- Motor oil black pour from the draft to a small goblet with a medium mocha brown cap. The frothy head dies down to a ring and several small sheets of lacing are left behind.
S/T- Massive Speedway base with a heaping amount of heavily roast grains as well as a touch of dark fruits. Seems to have more of a milk chocolate feel here for whatever reason with plenty of luscious coffee throughout giving a touch of fruit and espresso tones.
MF- About as big as they come with massive thickness on the palate and a creamy, slick consistency. Moderately high carbonation and the slightest hint of warming; impressive for 12%.
Ol' reliable Speedway series delivers another great brew. This one is a blast of chocolate and coffee all around and for some reason I personally get more cocoa than usual in this variant. 851 characterscbutova, Nov 26, 2015

Pours out completely pitch black. Oily, inky, no light getting through.
The aroma has this intense coffee smell up front. It's earthy, espresso notes, black coffee, just layers and layers of different types of coffee. Dark chocolate, slight vanilla, roasted malts as well.
The taste is huge on the varying layers of coffee too (especially once it's warmed up). There's a really nice bittersweet dark chocolate note too that combined with the coffee is like a dark chocolate covered espresso bean. The coffee is big and extremely complex, but it's not acidic or bitter either. Nice vanilla notes, some roasted malt notes too.
The alcohol is very well hidden, full bodied and the mouthfeel is super creamy.
Awesome beer that lived up to the hype!! 823 charactersJohnnyMc, Nov 05, 2015

3.35/5  rDev -24.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 2.75On tap at Pizza Port in Ocean Beach. Near black with a fine beige foam in the tall tulip. 
Coffee is the main flavor, not surprisingly, but it's more of an intense espresso taste. Which would be okay if it wasn't so goopy and sweet and bitter at the same time. There's a cream flavor plus bitter spice, like old cinnamon. As you sip the bitterness emerges. Very hoppy, very charbroiled, very sugary, and deeply, madly coffee flavored.
After a few sips the whole over-sexed concoction becomes undrinkable. Strictly for those for whom too much is never enough. For me this is one whale I'll leave rotting on the beach. 618 charactersmactrail, Oct 29, 2015

A- Pour is a thick, viscous black, with a finger or so of frothy head that lasts about two minutes. It leaves behind a nice lacing.
S- Amazing!! The cocoa and coffee coming off this is fantastic! 
T- Bitter cocoa melded with coffee. Simply delicious. 
M- Medium bodied with good carb. Wanted this to drink like a milk shake but it didnt. That's really my only gripe. 
O- Fantastic beer. Really glad I got to try this on tap prior to seeking out a bottle, which I will promptly do! 515 charactersRAlmeida77, Oct 29, 2015

Served in a snifter
The beer poured a murky brown/black and was topped by a thin, frothy, caramel colored crown that quickly dissolved. A bit thin in body for the style. Multiple rings of drippy lacing trickled along the glass.
The aroma was solid but contained absolutely no coffee. Really malty and robust. Dark chocolate notes were quite apparent. Rich and fudge-y. Good amount of brown sugar sweetness too. Stone fruits also came through strong. Raisins and plums were most noticeable. There was a subtle, pleasant booziness as well.
Rich dark chocolate notes lead things off in the flavor profile. Somewhat spicy with loads of vanilla. Perhaps a touch of cinnamon too. Malty and robust. Moderately roasty. Bit of coffee in the center, but the coffee was rather subtle. Lots of roastiness on the back end. The beer finished with bitter, earthy hop notes, more roast and a good amount of alcohol warmth. All in all, a bit rougher around the edges than I would have preferred.
The mouthfeel was thinner than expected for a beer at this magnitude but still solid. Rich, creamy and frothy on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence that gave the beer a nice fluffiness.
I was not a big fan of the original and bourbon barrel-aged Speedway Stouts, as I found both of these to be overly roasty and boozy, and thinner in both flavor and body. Unfortunately, the Vietnamese Coffee variant had many of these same issues. I am glad I had the opportunity to try this beer, but I definitely would not seek it out again. 1,589 charactersDamian, Oct 28, 2015

As expected it pours deep black with khaki colored head and very nice lacing. Honestly I'm not overly impressed with the nose but it is what it . . . Coffee, roasted malts, some random spices thrown in there as well. Taste is just delicious and it might be just me but this is similar tasting to KBS but with a much, much better and thicker feel.

4.34/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I was given notice that a keg of this was coming so it was with anticipation of something great that I bought this. It did not disappoint. 
It's black with a weak head and little fizz. The aroma is beautiful coffee and ashes but somewhat subtle.
The taste is a malty, bitter-sweet. Coffee dominates but it is joined by everything from hops and roasty malts and very faintly some yeast. 
This is a great brew. It's balanced, in it's own over the top way, and very drinkable. The booze is not to be noticed, unlike the regular. I am sure I will feel it once I finish this half growler. It is a fairly civilized humongous brew - maybe a little harsh on the throat. It can overpower any food. I am eating a spicy sandwich with raw scallion on it and this cuts right through and goes well with it. 
It is not a great value, but who cares! Recommended. 850 charactersschoolboy, Oct 15, 2015

While it was certainly a delicious beer, I must admit, I thought it would be better. After letting it warm, the flavors one would expect to erupt, lay dormant. I didn't taste much coffee flavor at all. Still, it was medium bodied and went down smooth. I'd drink it again. 358 charactersDolphinsmarlins1, Oct 13, 2015

Poured black with a thin brown head, not much in the way of retention or lacing.  Big nose of dark roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, molasses.  The taste follows with a big grain presence, lots of coffee, some vanilla, a touch boozy but really nicely balanced.  Full, thick and round on the palate.  Delicious!! 358 charactersmtomlins, Aug 07, 2015

3.99/5  rDev -10.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Two year old bottle I believe, having been cellared at home since purchase at the brewery.  Poured into a snifter showing a deep black and a light mocha cap.  Brief retention and light lace follow.  
Aromas of rich chocolate malts and a hint of ethanol as expected given the robust character and ABV.  Coffee notes are quite blended by now and express themselves mostly as a level of bitterness to balance the sweetness of the base beer.
Taste is classic speedway but with a drier finish and a more complex mouthfeel , as the coffee again cuts the one sided finish of the base beer.  Overall quite solid though I think I would have preferred it fresh. 653 charactersHalfFull, Jun 15, 2015

Appearance - Served in an 8 ounce snifter with a broken layer of surface suds, this brew is black with cola brown edging. Streaks of lace down the sides as the brew is consumed and exhibit nice stick.
Smell - Lush chocolate notes along with lesser vanilla and molasses sweetness. Boozy. Hints of roast coffee sit beneath.
Taste - Follows the nose to an extent. Predominant chocolate flavor and a big, boozy bite. Vanilla, brown sugar and molasses notes hit mid-taste, adding to the layered complexity. Coffee roast hits in the finish along with a numbing anise quality.
Mouthfeel - Full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Silky texture with a touch of sticky syrup. Goes down nicely despite the big ABV.
Overall - Yeah, this is nice. Amazing complexity packaged with a smooth, drinkable delivery. I'm not sure if it's better than the standard Speedway, but that's because it's amazing too. Well recommended. 961 charactersTheSixthRing, Apr 12, 2015

The smell was Halls menthol eucalyptus.  The taste followed that smell.  Tried multiple pours from the bottle at different temperatures.  Shared with a friend that got the same taste.  Neither of us detected any coffee flavor beyond typical stout roast.  Other than that, it's a tad on the thin side compared to alternate stouts. 442 charactersPHBoiler, Mar 15, 2015

There was an overwhelming dose of coffee, oak, and dark chocolate in the nose. Comes down so easy in the flavors along with that delicious Vietnamese coffee, however, it was not as bold as it was in the aromatics. Lots of roasted oak and dark chocolate. Thick mouthfeel with a slightly bitter back finish. Well put together! 383 charactersCuriousMonk, Feb 06, 2015

Smell:  Dark chocolate and coffee tones, supported by roast, Saigon cinnamon, caramel and vanilla
Taste:  Roast and dark chocolate, up front, with the coffee, Saigon cinnamon and caramel building; after the swallow, the vanilla and a hint of hazelnut arrives; the finish is rich and balanced
Mouthfeel:  Full bodied with moderate carbonation; slight warmth in the gullet
Overall:  Another great Speedway variant; this one is very reminiscent of a Vietnamese coffee

S  chocolate covered raisins, plums, burnt brown sugar, fudge, chocolate syrup, sweetened cream, not as much coffee as expected but that still leaves a fair amount, no clue where the 12% is hiding 
T  much more coffee in the mouth, some charred wood, more coffee, heaps of chocolate of all kinds, and just a little spice I can't place, once again I'm struggling to find booze 
M  thick and bitter,  a little gritty, enough bubbles to please, sticky on the stash, no heats impressive for a beer this big, coffee and char on the finish 
O  well rounded and drinkable for such a big beer, the coffee plays a major role but I was almost surprised that it wasn't complete overkill

5/5  rDev +12.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look-Pours a rich, espresso brown with an impressive two fingers of dark brown head that retains very well.
Smell- A very complex, smooth, coffee dominates the aroma, with notes of chocolate, cinnamon, nutmeg.
Taste-Toasty malt flavors quickly followed by the sophisticated Vietnamese coffee, classic, fine coffee taste blended with cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.
Feel-Medium bodied. not thin but surprisingly crisp, high carbonation, finishes slightly creamy. very unexpected feel in the best way.
Overall- one of the best stouts i've ever had. 544 charactersSteveB24, Jan 01, 2015

S - Benefits greatly from warming a bit.  Anise, malted milk balls, plum, milk chocolate, and medium roast coffee.
T - Delicious, sharp, dark roasted coffee with dark chocolate, molasses, and caramelized barley.  Dry latte, caramel, oak, and burnt toast through the finish.
M - Medium-full body.  Mildly slick with a creamy finish.

4.75/5  rDev +7%This may be the best speedway variation I have ever tried.  Chris from Belmont Station was kind enough to bring several coffee variations, as well as the bourbon barrel aged version.  Everything was delicious and amazing, but this beer seemed to have a light creamy flavor profile that the others lacked.  
This is definitely right up there with some of the very best coffee imperial stouts I've ever tried.  Very, very impressive. 432 charactersJohn_M, Dec 15, 2014

4.66/5  rDev +5%Opaque black with a dark tan foam that drapes the glass in lace.  Huge walls of sweet coffee and chocolate in the nose.   Intense layers of cocoa and chocolate accompany roasty, aromatic coffee and citrusy hop bitterness.  Milkshake thick mouthfeel.  Very complex and impossibly drinkable for the ABV.
World class stout.  So delicious.  A must try, like the original Speedway Stout. 383 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Nov 16, 2014

Consumed: 11.15.13
A: 4.75 Pitch black and looks very thick, perhaps a bit thicker than regular speedway. The two-finger tan head is dense, yet creamy and frothy looking, and lasts about three minutes.
S: 4.5 Aromas are a bit more aggressive than regular speedway, particularly the coffee. Initially, there’s an interesting grassy aroma, but that backs off after just a couple minutes. The coffee smells quite a bit different than the regular; less dark roasted characteristics, while having a pretty earthy quality too. Vanilla, chocolate, spice (cinnamon and maybe even a bit of nutmeg), come through as well. Overall, it seems a bit more balanced than the regular.
T: 4.5 The flavor seems to be a pretty big departure from the regular version. There’s a bit more sweetness up front followed by smooth coffee flavors (nothing too dark or harsh), lots of vanilla, and a bit of spice. Light bitterness is on the finish pairing well with dark chocolate flavors. 
M: 4.5 The body seems like it is a slightly thicker than regular speedway, though, like the regular, not as rich as I was expecting. The carbonation is just about perfect and there’s a slightly dry finish. Very satisfying and leaving you wanting more.
O: 4.5 I was skeptical to think that this version could be substantially better than the regular. While it’s not head and shoulders above its regular cousin (which would be nearly impossible, considering how good the regular version is), it is quite a bit more balanced and interesting. It is very satisfying and has some of the same complexities as a bourbon barrel aged stout, only without the bourbon flavor. 1,659 charactersTele, Nov 16, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7%Shared a bottle with my son, poured into Snifters. Oh My God! This is amazing...
A- Pour is a thick, viscous black, with a finger or so of frothy head that lasts about two minutes. It leaves behind a nice lacing.
S- Wow! The cocoa and coffee coming off this is fantastic! Just perfectly balanced and oh so pleasing.
T- I am taken back to childhood when I stole a piece of my moms baking cocoa thinking it would be sweet chocolate, boy was I wrong. Thats exactly what I get here (in the best way ever!). The darkest most bitter cocoa joined by a slightly sweet coffee. As it warms there's just a hint of alcohol and some dark fruit adding just a touch to the sweetness while never actually becoming sweet. I know that sounds strange but I couldn't describe it as sweet, even though there's a bit of that going on.
M- Medium to full. Slight carbonation that feels velvety smooth. Leaves a wonderfully enjoyable bitter cocoa on the finish.
O- Just fantastic. I can't really think of anything I'd like to see that's not already here. May have even picked up a bit of vanilla somewhere. This makes me want to get some Vietnamese coffee! So glad I have another bottle in the cellar... 1,183 charactersdeford, Nov 11, 2014

Pours a dark and inky black, with a small mocha-colored head, and a small amount of lacing. Looks uber inviting.
Smells just insane. Creamy, iced coffee, hazelnut, vanilla, chocolate and roasted malt. So amplified, and strong smelling.
I don't really even drink coffee on it's own, but this makes me want to try Vietnamese coffee. The coffee flavor on this one is undoubtedly the strongest, bold, and warmest coffee flavor I've ever gotten out of a beer. It's got an almost condensed milk flavor, with vanilla cream, hazelnut, walnut, chocolate, big roasted malt flavor, lactose. The coffee is nutty, creamy, milky, freshly roasted, and slightly bitter, and just unbelievably rich and complex. Get the picture? Amazing.
This has an amazing mouthfeel, rich, with a deadly amount of creaminess and silkiness, almost feels like velvet melting in my mouth. It's sweet, but not cloyingly so, with a lower level of carbonation. It's drinkable and crushable, but you don't really want to, because you never want the glass to end.
This is honestly one of the best stouts I've ever had. I'm speechless, this is the definition of next level. 1,205 charactersGreesyFizeek, Oct 16, 2014

A - Jet black pour with creamy thick head that slowly dissapates.

T - Fantastic! Everything blends perfectly. Coffee mixes well with the chocolate and alcohol is very hidden... sneaky sneaky.
M - Slightly overcarbonated, but it was shipped from San Diego.. so I'll let it slide.

4.48/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle (bottled 8/5/13) poured into a CBS snifter.
A - Pitch black on the pour with a thick finger plus cap of frothy cappuccino foam with very good staying power. Several minutes pass before it significantly fades and the glass is coated nicely with thick webs of lacing over almost the entire surface.
S - I get a rich coffee aroma up front with a firm complement of berry aroma along with it. Plenty of roast all around. Hints of caramel and molasses and a bit of anise for good measure. Milky chocolate completes the picture.
T - Milk chocolate up front, a touch of burnt/charred malt, lots of roasted malt, and some mild caramel. Coffee comes thru quite well especially as the beer warms a bit - smooth, slightly acidic. There is a thick creaminess to this beer, semi-sweet notes further smooth out this beer quite well. Light hop bitterness, a bit of a green, grassy hop component, but at a low level. Alcohol is well hidden but is not undetectable - light warmth can be felt on the swallow and found on each inhale. Each inhale also brings the berry-like, estery character noticed in the aroma.
M - Medium/full bodied with a lower level, creamy carbonation. Estery, roasty, coffee-centric, chocolately imperial stout - complex describes it. Mild alcohol warmth that lets you know this is a 12% beer, but smooth enough that you completely forget that fact while drinking it.
O - Very, very good imperial stout. Regular Speedway is great by itself. This Vietnamese coffee version takes it up another notch. Not quite the religious experience I've heard others describe this as, but certainly upper echelon material. I think this is the 3rd bottle I have had and happy there is still one left in the cellar - will be happy to revisit this one again at least one more time. 1,787 charactersportia99, May 31, 2014

Nice dark and rich pour with a fat mocha crown. Smells rich and decadent...a very inviting and luxurious twist on a solid base.
Coffee shows greasy and oily if that makes any sense at all....odd and while not entirely unpleasant, I'm not sure this coffee agrees with me. 
Finishes oily and watery despite a nice body and heft through the middle.
A disappointing beer to be sure. While I enjoy the base and most variants, something here just didn't sit well with me. My only similar comparison was a coffee used in one of the older BCBCS that I really felt displayed an unsavory oily bean quality.
I'm sure I'm a dipshit, but my tastes are my tastes. 738 charactersBarrytheBear, May 27, 2014

A - Dark just like all the others with a solid half inch mocha foam head
S - Huge notes of milk chocolate and coffee with hints of vanilla
T - Taste follows the nose as I thought this blended really well and brought out the milky chocolate flavors that blended perfectly with the coffee. Lack of bitterness was fine for me and with ten months this was tasting fantastic
M - medium body medium carb 
O - Overall this was better then JBM by a good bit. This really is more than I expected. Fantastic coffee stout 584 charactersdrmcleod10, May 24, 2014

Grumbler to Alesmith Snifter
32oz
Purchased at AleSmith Brewing on 5/17
App- When I think back on stouts its hard to not just rate a 5. I mean if its dark and deep pitched brown/black with some head and a little bit of cling. I mean this beer has cling for days. Quite a sight to see. Layered and sticky.
Smell- When I think of iced coffee. I think Vietnamese from Lees sandwiches. This is a mix of a stout and coffee. Blended and rich with a bit of sweetness and grainy coffee. The stout portion takes over with a grainy malt bill and then lends with a bit of vanilla and creme from say a liquid coffee sweetener. Very rich on the nose.
Taste- I love speedway stout. I cant lie. For a base stout with coffee. Its what other beers achieve to aspire to with coffee. This takes the base beer to a whole other realm. The other coffee brings a certain sweetness with a rich milk flavor with a bit of sweet chocolate and a bit of vanilla. Creamy and rich and decadent. 
Mouth- A very medium body with a medium carbonation level. Silky, velvety and rich like a melted chocolate with a bit of espresso for days. The residual flavors are a bit of bitter hops with a rich roasted coffee flavor.
Drink- I posted this on IG. I am like Cosmicevan. I am ZeroF'sgiven. Ill take this grumbler down for my birthday and not think twice. Cant wait for Kopi or BA Kopi on tap. 1,383 charactersFosterJM, May 19, 2014

A- pours pitch black with a small fizzy light tan head that has good retention as the head remains bubbly long after the pour
S- fresh roasted coffee aroma up front, followed by ripe banana and melted milk chocolate. There's a slightly smoky charcoal character, finishing with some fruity notes
T- fresh coffee up front, perhaps the freshest coffee flavor that I've experienced form a beer and very coffee-forward. Beyond the coffee, some chocolate notes begin to kick in followed by some slightly smoky notes. More coffee on the finish that continues to sit fresh on the palate
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slick mouthfeel and finish
O- one of the best coffee flavors I've ever had from a stout, the freshness of the flavor is just ridiculous and meshes very well with the chocolate flavors, alcohol is also hidden very well 919 charactersTreyliff, May 13, 2014

32oz mini growler pours a pitch color with an inch of frothy medium brown head. Lots of spotty lacing. This one smells great. The aroma is a nice mix of espresso, vanilla, caramel, and chocolate syrup. The taste is a mix of espresso and chocolate syrup. Roasted malts, earth, vanilla and caramel. More coffee flavors towards the finish mixed in with chocolate syrup. Very noticeable alcohol presence. Slick mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. This beer made the long trip to CT no problem and I am very grateful for that. Overall, an amazing beer that improves on an already great one. 639 charactersPicoPapa, Mar 28, 2014

4.42/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Big bottle from trade dated 8/5/13. Huge thanks for a big want of mine. Pours pitch black with a big brown creamy head on top. Aroma of roasted grains, sweet dark fruits, some chocolate and fudge, and nearly no coffee on the nose. Flavor is big fudgy chocolate and some lightly spicy coffee, some vanilla and smooth espresso, roasty and lots of milk chocolate. This is extremely creamy bodied with low medium carbonation. I have not had Vietnamese coffee before, but this blend comes off with more smooth and creamy sweet sugars--almost like a lactose addition, though I know it has been confirmed there is not lactose added here--and vanilla than big bold spicy coffee notes. I assume this is due to the different coffee variant. I don't know if maybe the coffee faded already in the nose and elsewhere, but altogether a beautifully smooth stout that I find different from the other variants I have had. Everything about this is extremely well done, I just wish there were more to the aroma. 992 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 18, 2014

Aroma consists of deep roasted barley malt with notes of dry coffee with some hazelnut nectar which rounds off some of the rough edges. Taste is a mix between some deep dry roasted malt notes with dry coffee notes and some hazelnut notes which helps rounds off the flavours. Body is quite full with good carbonation and nice creamy body and no apparent alcohol. I liked this version better than the Koppi version. 520 charactersPhyl21ca, Feb 17, 2014

Appearance: Pours a viscous looking black color,with a solid 3/4" tan head, which has good retention and lacing. Nice start. 
Smell: Smells of dank coffee, semi sweet dark chocolate, and vanilla. Really not quite as much dank coffee on the nose as I had anticipated. More sweetness than I was expecting. 
Taste: Like the smell, coffee bitterness up front, with more prevalent dark chocolate and vanilla sweetness. Warming alcohol bite on the end.
Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is full, with a great level of fine carbonation. Excellent. It drinks right up to its ABV. Overall a nice stout. Was kind of expecting the coffee to be a bit danker and in my face, with a touch less sweetness. As it was though, still very nice and an improvement over the base beer. 784 characterszhanson88, Jan 28, 2014

Score: 97
Bottled 08/05/13. Served in a Surly Darkness chalice and enjoyed on 01/23/13.
Appearance: Jet black in color. Pours two fingers of khaki head that recede to thin, coating layer and thick ring around the glass. Great lacing and retention. This is a beautiful looking stout. 5/5
Smell: Milk chocolate, high percentage cacao dark chocolate, vanilla, cake batter, molasses, raisins and dried dark fruits. There are undertones of coffee, but they are much subtler than you would expect from a coffee stout. A little cinnamon comes across too. The doughy cake, vanilla and cacao notes are surprisingly prominent relative to the coffee character -- I was expecting roast and a big blast of coffee based on the last time I had this beer -- but the heavy dose of cacao and vanilla is welcome surprise. Everything here is in perfect balance, and the dark fruit character mixes in seamlessly unlike regular Speedway Stout. This nose is absolutely incredible. 5/5
Taste: There's the coffee I was expecting! Upfront hits a big blast of smooth, bitter roast and chocolatey coffee flavor that lingers long. Delightfully creamy, not that acidic. There's a big dark fruit character on the back half that's not nearly as neatly integrated as it was in the nose at first. Notes of bakers chocolate, oak and molasses too. The dark fruit mellows out and blends in to the rest of the beer much better as the brew warms up. In fact, by room temp, all the flavors blend wonderfully and more chocolate notes come through. No booziness; I would never guess that this is 12% ABV. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Not quite full bodied, but nicely viscous. Carbonation level is spot on. Very creamy mouthfeel with a dry finish. Has some sweetness towards the finish, which counterbalances the upfront bitterness nicely. Can't ask for much more in the mouthfeel department than this in a stout. 5/5
Overall: A really excellent stout from Alesmith that is better than any of their barrel aged projects, and a major step up from the base beer, in my opinion. While not quite up to the level of the Kopi Luwak variant, this twist on Speedway Stout is excellent in its own way. The bitterness here is quite appetizing, and the dark fruit, molasses and chocolate mix well balancing the sweet and bitter characters. My recommendation is that you drink this one on the warmer side. Proceed with caution, however, as this beer is dangerously dome-able.
Cost: $18 for a 750 ml bottle. 2,555 charactersjegross2, Jan 24, 2014

A - Pours jet black with a nice one finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace down the sides of the glass.
S - Smells of intense fresh brewed coffee, bit of bakers chocolate, dash of vanilla extract, molasses, dark fruits, plenty of dark roast and some light booze. The coffee is intense and yet it doesn't completely overshadow the supporting aromas.
T - Starts off with with a huge blast of fresh brewed vietnamese coffee that never really fades away. Hints of vanilla, molasses, bakers chocolate, dark fruits and plenty of dark roast help round it all out. Booze grows as it warms up but never really gets in the way of the flavors. Finish is pretty roasty with a bit of sweetness, lingering long after the finish.
M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Heavy, roasty feel from start to finish. Pretty easy to consume all things considered.
O - I have wanted to try this one for a long time and I am really glad it lived up to my expectations. The coffee was stronger than the Kopi version which was a pleasant surprise, yet it was still pretty easy to consume. After mixing some of this with the BA speedway we drank right after it it's safe to say that I would love to see a BA version of this. 1,355 charactersorangesol, Jan 19, 2014

Pour is Banner of Mordor black with only a flash of head, then, still. My wife makes a blasphemous (but positive) exclamation at the smell: yes, she's a coffee junkie. I get less coffee than I expect (I am not an addict, or even a drinker of, coffee, so that's good) & chocolate so milky it's turning off-white. Bit of creamer. 
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee should have been sampled right beside a regular bottle: because to me, coffee is coffee, since I know no better. This is my kind of coffee: more creamer than bean. First impression is of sweet cream & malts, & only then does a mild bitterness intrude (pleasantly) along with a roast more decadent than Caligula. No alcohol in my glass. In the shadows are a faint nutty twist, vanilla, chocolate. It all comes together with a thunderclap of smooth that's so silky it belongs on a Victoria's Secret model. Preferably Jill Goodacre. Wait, sorry, my age is showing. I'm already more than halfway through my portion of the bottle. 
Smooth. Like, wow, smooth. I arrived here expecting a coffee bomb & instead was greeted by a coffee seduction. Smooth, delicious, rich, this is one excellent beer. 1,362 charactersmaximum12, Jan 03, 2014

Appearance: not quite black as night, more like the color of black coffee. A nice brownish head built up which dissipated quickly to a shiny smooth surface like motor oil. 
Smell: picked up some dark fruit, coffee of course, some chocolate, alcohol as it warms up, as well as some leather. 
Taste: interestingly it almost tasted as if this was barrel-aged, I can pick up the notes of bourbon. The coffee is strong and intense, just a bit astringent but not in a bad way. There is the sweetness coming from the beer but than the bitterness from the coffee shines through. This is a rich one with the flavors becoming more in depth as it warms up. As opposed to other coffee stouts, this is appropriate for sipping like cognac. With all these rich flavors, it almost like umami. 
Mouthfeel: its heavy bodied and as it warms up there is a slight burn at the back of the mouth. It also starts to become creamier at room temp. 
Overall: outstanding beer! Hard to believe this is not barrel-aged, but thats just me thinking. The flavors are so rich and it's one of those beers that great for sharing as opposed to other coffee imperial stouts. 1,186 charactersBenish, Jan 02, 2014

The beer pours a deep jet black color, super opaque, touches of cola brown when held to the light, with a thick, firm caramel head that has poor retention and leaves only a spot or two of lace behind. The aroma is of heavy coffee, one of the more beautiful beans at that, lightly roasted, loads of fruit character with nice toasted cocoa, vanilla and rich malted grain and just a trace of hot alcohol. The coffee is on full display here and it really comes across on the tongue, just a subtle roast with sweeter fruit and cocoa that is also lightly bitter, vanilla is really nice with a bit of creaminess and a lot of sweet, hearty rich grain. Alcohol is well hidden on the tongue, the beer is certainly sweet, but the earthiness of the coffee helps cut that down nicely. The bean is showcased so well against the backdrop of a big stout. The mouthfeel is fantastic, rich, silky and coats the mouth superbly well. The finish is super creamy and soft with a light warming sensation. 
Verdict: A great coffee stout and a really great adaptation on the base stout. The fruitiness of the bean, along with some earthy qualities really shine and the subtle roast is wonderful. I still struggle with how sweet this beer is, but it's a joy to drink in smaller quantities. 1,403 characterskevanb, Nov 19, 2013

4.78/5  rDev +7.7%The beer reminds me of what a coffee stout should or if Founders Breakfast Stout was actually deserving of its rating.
The beer offers more than the base beer with a huge amount of coffee and almost a creamy flavor. Lots of chocolate balances out the bitterness of the coffee. A full mouthfeel, but the beer is still quite drinkable. The beer drinks under 10%.
One of the best non-barrel coffee stouts. 404 charactersdar482, Oct 07, 2013

Pitch black and opaque with a one finger beige head that quickly settles into a thick, lasting ring.  Good retention considering the style and ABV with streaks of soapy lacing left behind.
Absolutely ridiculous nose on this beer.  Tons of perfectly roasted gourmet coffee along with lactose cream, condensed milk and sweet fudge-y chocolate malt.  Deeply roasted with tons of coffee character but never approaches smelling burnt or acrid.  Holy shit this beer smells good!  
Medium bodied with slight viscosity and really nice roasted black coffee/espresso bean flavor countered by sweet lactose creaminess and dessert like chocolate malt.  Burnt toast and robust gourmet coffee flavor with oatmeal and bittersweet dark chocolate. That lactose presence is really, really nice and is very reminiscent of the condensed milk on the bottom of a cup of Vietnamese coffee.  Well balanced but still roasty as hell.  Delicious beer that perfectly captures the elements of Vietnamese coffee without taking away the stout characteristics of the base beer.  Highly recommended! 1,099 characterscorby112, Oct 07, 2013

A - Pitch black, not even a ruby hue on the edge (like a good stout should be). Mocha head leaves good lacing.
S - Milk chocolate, a very dark, acidic coffee scent, dried cherries.
T - I read that they added lactose to it to mimic the sweetened condensed milk in normal vietnamese coffee. I can definitely taste it. Blends nicely with the dark, strong coffee, and dark chocolate and dried cherry flavors. Very rich, not much alcohol burn.
M - Rich, full, and creamy. Low carbonation.
O - Awesome beer. Had at the tasting room when I picked up my bottles and instantly regretted not by buying as much as I could have. 711 charactersjeff1973, Sep 19, 2013

The look is a nice dark brown to black with some excellent lacing and a decent frothy ring of tan-off white head. 
The smell is nice but thin in its complexity, plenty of bitter coffee grinds along with some vanilla bean and cocoa beans to round it out. The smell is a bit astringent which departs from the nice aromas. The taste follows suit in many ways, but it is filled in by a hefty malt bill and some deeper sweet and savory flavors that make the coffee tastes richer. A very complex palate that seems to open up as it warms and deepens with each taste. 
The feel is a nice medium feel with little burn. It goes over smoothly, and caps off a very nice brew overall. 798 charactersDreadnaught33, Sep 17, 2013

The beer has a finger tall foamy dark mocha head that slowly reduces to a medium sized patch of medium thick film surrounded by a large patch of thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate to significant amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Moderate to strong aromas of roasted malts, freshly brewed coffee, and dark chocolate. Light aromas of vanilla and caramel with a hint of cream.
T: Upfront there is a moderate to strong flavor of roasted malts with a moderate amount of lactose + caramel sweetness. That is followed by strong flavors of dark chocolate and freshly brewed coffee. Light flavors of vanilla with a hint of cream. Light to moderate amounts of lingering roasty bitterness in the finish.
M: Just shy of full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with a hint of alcohol warming in the finish.
O: This beer has an amazing, great coffee aroma and really enjoyable coffee + chocolate flavors. Very enjoyable and hides the 12% ABV quite well. 1,222 charactersdbrauneis, Sep 07, 2013

Pours a pitch black with a slight beige head. The smell is amazing...its like a blend of vanilla and coffee that seemingly makes a whole new aroma i've never had the pleasure of enjoying before now. The taste is also, thankfully, just as it smells. Real creamy and that vanillay/coffee/chocolate blend just works wonders on my palate. Full bodied but the alcohol is completely hidden. real treat to drink.
Overall possibly my new favorite imperial stout that i've tried. I really, really dug the blend of flavors on this one.

Raul was picturing rice fields; Raul was picturing himself getting lost in the beauty of Vietnam... Speedway Vietnam Coffee Stout though...not so much. Don't get Raul wrong, this is a great beer; but subtle, it's subtle like Miley Cyrus' brainwaves. Not much on the coffee here. Very good, but not the "yep!" status that Raul was hoping for. 399 charactersRaulMondesi, Aug 12, 2013

This beer looks amazing. I say that big stouts look thick and black, but this is especially so. It is deep abyssal black with a nice fluffy mocha head that was still there a half hour later. The lacing is ridiculous on this beer, and as the beer goes down, the glass is pretty much stained brown by the oily traces. It looks like I'm drinking carbonated black coffee!
The smell is mostly an intense bitter black coffee flavour with a ton of roasty malt sweetness. Its not incredibly different from Speedway in this regard although I definitely get a bit more of the sweetness. Its as if the coffee is less intense but more complex.
Now the taste is where it separates itself from the regular Speedway. Chocolates, cocoa, lactose, hints of marshmallows and dark fruit. Heavy on the chocolate and lactose. It is incredibly sweet yet balanced out very well by an intense coffee flavour that isn't too bitter yet the flavour is still incredibly strong. That's the major difference between this one and other coffee stouts- you still taste intense coffee flavours but without that bitterness.
The mouthfeel is great as always. Thick bodied, viscous, creamy and smooth. Very enjoyable to drink and there is absolutely no hint of that 12% ABV even as it gets to room temperature. That aftertaste is that bitter yet mellow sweet coffee flavour accompanied by the roasty malts and chocolate.
Regular Speedway is incredibly delicious yet this one is a nice twist on it. I would absolutely go out of my way to drink this one again. This will probably end up being one of the best coffee stouts I've had and this includes a lot of barrel-aged coffee stouts out there. 1,781 charactersStevedore, Aug 08, 2013

Appearance - Inky black. Good dark khaki head. Settles to a collar.
Smell - Intense coffee. Initially seems to be the same a regular Speedway, but it has a lighter almost fruity characteristic to the coffee. 
Taste - The coffee has a much lighter and intense flavor than the other variants that I've had. This one is less earthy and more fruity. Roasty malts and bitterness at the end. Light, but present, caramel malt flavor.
Mouthfeel - Roasty and bitter. Well carbonated. Medium -heavy body. As heavy as it should be.
Overall - The coffee is interesting and a surprisingly unique flavor. I figured this would taste the same as regular Speedway. The perceived delicacy of the coffee flavor means the depth of the coffee and malt flavor suffers a skosh, but I enjoy it just as much as regular Speedway. 867 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 22, 2013

Not impressed. 280 charactersArrogantB, May 06, 2013

Pours a ring of dark, rich mocha head. A swirl gives a luxuriously thick head that dissipates quickly. Nice surprise given this was a week-old-shipped-across-the-country growler. Beer is rich, thick, and pitch black. Lacing is spotty and stringy with average stick. Thin, oily legs. A solid looking beer for the style and serving vessel.
Nose is chocolate, cocoa, and lactose. A slight bit of roasty bitterness complemented nicely by fudge and molasses sweetness. Overtones of light booziness. Moderately aromatic and nice balance.
Opens mocha, dark chocolate, lactose and coffee. Some almond and nuttiness towards the middle with more lactose sweetness. Molasses, fudge and coffee at the end. Finishes slight roast, cocoa, and more coffee. Aftertaste of chocolate, roasted malt sweet and tartness and fudge. Very, very nice. 
Full bodied with low carbonation. Thick and oily in the mouth and goes down smooth and silky. Finishes messy with a sticky, lingering aftertaste. Leaves your lips sweet and sticky. Nearly perfect. The overall lack of carbonation actually helps the feel a good deal. 
I haven't had any of the other non-bottled Speedway variations but if they're all like this, I'm officially hooked. This beer has great complexity and an incredible feel. A real sipper but not boozy at the same time. If you get a chance to try this, grab it! 1,502 charactersSpeedwayJim, Apr 30, 2013

A: Pours a beautiful one finger rich tan colour head of amazing thickness and retention. Excellent cream. Body colour is a solid jet black. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. 
Sm: Rich java/coffee, heavy refined dark chocolate, roast, dark malts, caramel, vanilla, and delightful malty sweetness. Roast emerges both from the coffee roast and from roasted barley. 
T: Amazing. Perfectly balanced chocolate and smooth roasty coffee notes. Excellent caramel and cream. Perfect dark malt foundation. Complex and subtle. Divine. No yeast character or alcohol comes through. I actually prefer this to Barrel Aged Speedway. 
Mf: Smooth, wet, rich, and of perfect thickness and carbonation. Feels custom tailored to the flavours, complementing them excellently. 
Dr: Obscenely drinkable at this high an ABV. A damn near perfect example of the style. I'll definitely hope to revisit this for a more in-depth review. Simply delicious.

12/24/13 bottle review. I'm excited to revisit my current 10th highest rated beer; I only got to try a sampler at Alesmith's tasting room. I'm curious how it holds up after almost a year of age. 12% ABV. Reviewed as an imperial stout. Served cold and allowed to warm. 750ml brown glass bottle with grey-black foil side-poured into an EKU 28 stem-snifter.
Bottled: 08/05/13.
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. 
Pours a one finger wide head of gorgeous rich khaki/light tan colour. Nice creaminess an thickness. Lovely even smooth consistency and soft complexion. Head retention is good - about 6-7 minutes. Even lacing clings to the sides of the glass initially but fizzles out.
Body colour is an opaque solid jet black. No floating yeast particles are visible.
Overall, it looks like an imperial stout should. I'm craving it.
Sm: Abundant coffee/java notes - roast, earthiness, bitterness, cream, and even some espresso/cappuccino notes too. Dark malts. Dark chocolate. Milk chocolate. Caramel. Cream. Hints of roasted barley. Coffee dominates, as it should, but the aroma has definitely receded with age, to its detriment. It's a great aroma for an imperial stout - just a bit timid. Below average strength for the style. 
It's quite clean - no yeast character or boozy alcohol presence is noticeable. 
T: Multidimensional coffee character - earthiness, bitterness, roast, java, cappuccino, espresso, etc. All the coffee elements are well integrated and balanced, and coffee is allowed to dominate over the dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cream, dark malts, chocolate malts, and caramel. As it warms, I'm also getting hints of cocoa powder. Some fudge. A kiss of mocha. Very pleasant but restrained lactose - a bit milk stout-esque. I don't really find the condensed milk of Brazilian coffee. I'm not finding the vanilla other reviewers have noted; maybe they're confusing it with the complex malty sweetness? A damn tasty brew across the board. 
The subtlety is incredible; this is not a heavy-handed or overwhelming imperial stout by any means. I do pick up light traces of a burnt/ashy character, which lends it still more complexity. Certainly a nuanced and intricate build for an imperial stout; I'd even call it gestalt.
Great depth of flavour. Above average duration of flavour. Below average intensity of flavour; it's bold, but not overwhelming.
Mf: The creaminess is fantastic, and lends the mouthfeel an amazing comforting softness which really takes the edge off the strength and boldness of the flavours. Smooth and wet. Perfect thickness and body. It's not too filling or heavy, but is rather silky and fleeting. Chewy. I'm amazed that at 12% it's not hot or boozy. Perfect carbonation. It does have a hint of acidity which suits the coffee but isn't ideal. 
Not oily or gushed. 
The texture is a near-perfect marriage to the taste, and feels custom-tailored specifically to it.
Dr: Obscenely drinkable for the ABV and style. I'll easily kill this bottle alone. I'm glad I got to revisit this brew. I'd definitely buy it again in spite of the high price point. It's an incredible beer every beer enthusiast should try. Perhaps Alesmith's best beer, and that's saying something. I don't know that it's as tasty now as it was fresh, but it holds up to age a lot better than regular Speedway. I stand by my A rating, but I don't know that it's quite worthy of being in my top 10. It lacks the delicacy and fragility of the absolute best beers I've ever had, but it comes damn close. They executed the premise of this beer almost perfectly. I'm impressed.

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, and a creamy coffee aroma. Taste is much the same with a slight fruit flavor and an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is really tasty and one of the best coffee aromas in a beer I have ever smelled. 627 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 21, 2013

I'll freaking tell you who... anotherjoe. Such generosity; endless thank yous are owed to you my friend. Poured from a 32oz growler into a snifter, the brew appears dark brown with a silky brown topping of froth that is rich and thick more than 2 fingers strong. The cap slowly dissolves leaving a full wall of lace sticking to the glass that fades to spots and a webbing pattern. When held up to the light, the brew shows some ruby clarity faintly around the edges. A swirl revives a half finger of froth back to the surface composed of super tiny, tight bubbles that are almost reminiscent of nitro.
The aroma is classic speedway but with a pretty hefty dose of super earthy and roasted coffee included. A seemingly exaggerated amount of leather, tobacco and hints of citrus that are commonly found in some fresh coffee beans is also present mingling with some dark fruity alcohol esters similar to prunes/raisins. There is a bit of a musty to almost mineral or metallic/carbonic inclusion also present towards the backend. As the brew reaches room temperature, the first indications of something like cocoa emerge. After the brew goes beyond ideal temperatures, when swirled the brew shows off some hints of sulfur and a hint of cheese which is strange but the pleasant aspects certainly outweigh the negative. Also, it seems as though the warmer this brew gets, the more a bit of herbal or vegetative hops start to show themselves.
The taste displays a solvent surge of alcohol upfront blending into a dry roasted almost acrid feel that strips the moisture from the tongue. The coffee is strong and bitter with plenty of roast, earth, leather, char, tobacco and some citrus components. More sips reveal a bit of anise flavors with traces of minerals and almost a carbonic quality. At times, there is a bit of fruity alcohol esters that make for dark prune or plum flavors that fade off to a bit of a hop presence that is herbal and almost vegetative. Just like the aroma, this brew starts off really solid and enjoyable and starts to take a strange twist as it warms up.
This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a silky smooth feel and moderate amount of carbonation. The feel of this brew is awesome for 12% and the carbonation is pretty much spot on. The coffee inclusion here starts off strong and is certainly an improvement on the normal speedway. However, as the experience continues, it starts to get a little awkward and I don't know if that is from the coffee inclusion or otherwise. Regardless, I am very much appreciative of the chance to try this and it has perked my interest to try the others if the opportunity ever presented itself. 2,753 charactersstakem, Jan 10, 2013

4.5 A: Black color. Two fingers of mainly cream, minorly frothy tan head. Retention is pretty good given the ABV and plenty of lacing is left, which is impressive given the coffee.
5.0 S: This smells amazing. I can't really remember what the regular Speedway smells like at the moment, but I'm just going to say that this is different and better. The coffee is sweeter and more chocolatety. Supple roast, caramel, light molasses, chocolate, sweet neutral maltiness. Big pithy coconut, vanilla, and a lactose-like creaminess. 
4.5 T: Tastes mainly like the nose, but isn't quite as powerful and impressive. Chocolate, roastiness, neutral maltiness, caramel, molasses, coconut, lactose, coconut, vanilla. Coffee is tangy, super smooth, chocolatety, and wonderfully roasty. Quite tasty.
4.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Super smooth and goes down incredibly easy. My only complaint is that it's not quite creamy enough. Still good here though.
4.5 D: Definitely a winner. I love the original Speedway, but wasn't impressed with the barrel aged version, but now I'm all about trying variants of this again. 1,210 charactersDavoleBomb, Dec 25, 2012

32oz growler poured into a pair of snifters.
Appearance: dark black bodied beer with 1 finger of thick and creamy medium tan head. Drops down to thin cap and spotty lacing is noted on the side of the glass.
Smell: Fresh, bold, and roasty expresso beans. You also get the lactose note in the nose and it adds an awesome sweet note to this beer. 
Taste: Very coffee forward. Big expresso coffee beans that taste really fresh and roasty just like it smells. Its not very bitter the coffee is very well balanced with the stout. You get some nice sweet notes of milk chocolates, coffee creamer, and vanilla . The beer finishes with a roasty coffee bitterness that mixes with more vanilla sweetness. I was really surprised just how much vanilla flavor was found through out this beer.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Cant believe this beer is 12%; not even a hint of booze at all. It drinks like its 7%abv (Beware this beer will creap up on you fast). The beer is silky and creamy. Carbonation level is just right in this beer. 
Overall: Honestly its the best non barrel aged coffee stout that I have drank to date. I love Speedway Stout and the different coffee beans and the lactose sugar make regular Speedway Stout even better! Bravo Alesmith keep up the great work! 1,352 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Dec 17, 2012

This was a nice surprise and one of my favorites of the night. 32 oz. growler into a tulip. Sampled side by side with a fresh normal Speedway Stout.
a - Pours a dark brown, almost black color, with one inch of dark tan head and low carbonation evident. Looks great.
s - Smells amazing, smells of super fresh coffee, vanilla, sweet chocolate, coconut, roasted malts, cream, bakers chocolate, caramel, and some toasted malts. Amazing nose; the coffee smells wonderful and sweet, and there was a very nice mix of sweet vanilla and chocolate to it as well. Perfect nose for me.
t - Tastes of fresh sweet coffee, cocoa, vanilla, sweet milk chocolate, roasted malts, toasted malts, espresso, cream, and light coconut. Taste has less coconut than the nose and is a little roastier, but still great.
m - Medium body and low carbonation. Easy to drink beer that doesn't feel like it is 12% ABV.
o - Overall a fantastic beer and an amazing improvement on the already great Speedway stout. While I still enjoy BA speedway more, I liked this one more than the Kopi Luwak version I've had in the past. Ton of awesome fresh coffe mixing with sweet vanilla and chocolate. Would love to have this one again and finding that pretty much any variation of Speedway seems to be awesome. 1,371 charactersmdfb79, Nov 19, 2012

Beer smells like coffee, roast, a little sweetness.
Beer is roasty and bitter on the finish, big bodied, especially compared to the regular Speedway stout served side by side to it. Beer has a great finish and a medium body.

Pours a viscous chocolate brown with a mocha colored head. Nose of fresh ground, earthy coffee, cocoa, and powdery chocolate. Rich, creamy body, soft carbonation and smooth roasty finish. No acidity or acrid notes in the flavor, just overload of baker's chocolate, fresh ground coffee, earthy and light roast, vanilla and cocoa. I expected this to just be regular Speedway with a slightly different coffee flavor but this greatly exceeded those expectations. 488 charactersyourefragile, Nov 18, 2012

Initially didn't post the review as I thought it was the same beer I had before, but after having it, and thinking about it and reviewing notes, I'm pretty sure the beer I had before was the Brewers Reserve Speedway with Vietnamese coffee.
Dark thick creamy rich 1 finger head fades slowly with nice lacing, pitch black beer, nice legs on the sides, etc.
Nose brings typical Speedway malts, cocoa, some roast, little creamy like characters with a little milk chocolate, mild toasted notes and chocolate, etc. Then some nice coffee, not a ton of coffee, but nice freshly roasty coffee, earthy, nutty, fresh roast, etc, not nearly like the other Vietnamese Speedway, but still nice.
Taste is similar to the nose, fresh toasted and roasted coffee right out, again that earthy nutty dusty woody coffee flavors, freshly roasted beans and fresh grinds, like coffee was just steeped in the beer. Then again that Speedway base, dark malts, toasty, roasted malts, creamy flavors with a milk chocolate and cocoa, little caramel, nice vanilla, etc. Finish is sticky and sweet, mild booze warmth which is hidden fairly well, little more roast and toasted notes, plenty more coffee lingering too.
Mouth is still very heavy bod, thick, rich, velvety and creamy, sticks all around the mouth, nice carb.
Overall quite nice, a step up from the base speedway with so much great coffee, the Vietnamese coffee is very unique and quite tasty, but pales in comparison to the awesomeness of the Brewers Reserve version we had before. 1,617 charactersjlindros, Oct 28, 2012

A - Poured into a stone ipa tulip glass a wonderful black ebony hue with a one finger mocha head that leaves tons of side lacing huge leggy lacy lacing and khaki blanket.
S - Aromas of outrageous vanilla and coffee beans Soooo much special Vietnamese coffee and chocolate. The melding of huge vanilla and chocolate ans coffee is so rich ans inviting. No ABV at all.
T - Taste is earth shattering amounts of vanilla here. Beans and extract with rich bitter coffee notes with super rich bakers 85% cocoa. So so much vanilla here ans barrel coffee chocolate. Gaaaahhhh!
M - Mouthfeel is a velour bedspread. Zap Branigan asks "boy lay out my formal shorts"...I would have so much snusnu if I could get a bathtub of this.

A - Light tan foam settles to a wispy, partial cap and spotty lacing. Body is pitch black.
S - The coffee is front and center, and it's definitely got that condensed milk flavor you get from Vietnamese coffee. In the periphery there is a hefty dose of dark bread and semisweet chocolate.
T - Flavor is quite similar, with a nice mix of iced coffee, creamer, vanilla sweetness, and semisweet chocolate. Sweeter than you'd expect from a coffee beer, with a slightly fruity flavor when it warms up.
M - Smooth, medium-full body, with lower carbonation. Dry and tannic cold-press coffee texture to it. Not much obvious alcohol here.
D - A really excellent beer, that was shockingly easy to drink. There was a touch of alcohol present when the beer fully warms up, but nothing shocking for 12%. Surprised by the low reviews, but maybe this batch was an improvement over previous ones. 963 charactersMasterSki, Oct 10, 2012

Pours an inky, viscous blackness with a thick tuft of browned head resting on top. Nice retention, leaving patchy bursts of lacing left behind on the taster.
Rich, fragrant roasted coffee beans erupt from the nose, balanced by soft chocolate sweetness. Heavy malts and roasted hints with caramel, molasses and prevalent coffee. Soft boozy glow as well, but well-tempered. 
Avalanche of coffee, nuts and chocolate land on the tongue upon first sip. Potent roasted coffee beans, but still remaining mild and pleasant. Semi-sweet chocolate notes with cocoa powder and caramel. Thick, bruising malt backbone with roasted notes and layers of rich flavor. Finishes with coffee and warmth. 
Fuller body, milder carbonation, fluffy, creamy and silky on the tongue. I'm already a huge fan of the base beer, so having the opportunity to try this variation was really exciting. 893 charactersxnicknj, Aug 01, 2012

On tap at Alesmith.
A: Black with an inch of creamy foam that leaves scattered lacing on the glass. Looks like Speedway.
S: Cocoa, dark chocolate, and burnt malt. Pronounced earth and acrid robust coffee. Light licorice and molasses.
T: Intense dark chocolate and strong licorice notes. The coffee profile is somewhat acrid and charred, reminiscent of over extracted coffee. This is pretty boozy and there's an upper moderate bitterness.
M: Full body with a silky, sticky, and chewy mouthfeel.
Overall: Too boozy and acrid. Not one of the better Speedway variations.  584 charactersHopHead84, Mar 31, 2012

Mouthfeel: Full body and low carbonation

Night of a Million Zillion Speedways
O'Brien's Pub
San Diego, CA
Dark as night black with brown edges, thin head but the body of this beer is just spectacular. It's thick and oily and leaves the glass absolutely covered in sticky lace. Thick as can be and dark as night. Spectacular. 
This is a far sweeter variation than typical Speedway Stout. The roasted coffee elements seem actually subdued in this one; the Vietnamese style coffee pushes through, and it seems a bit syrupy and sticky. The aroma resembles that of a sweet coffee liqueur. 
The flavor follows the nose as well. This was certainly the sweetest of the variations and seemed a bit syrupy.
Medium to thick mouthfeel with low carbonation.
A good variation, but a touch too sweet overall for my personal preferences. 793 charactersehammond1, Nov 14, 2011
