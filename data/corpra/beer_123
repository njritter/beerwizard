Aroma - Roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and oak. There are also hints of cinnamon and spices. All of the aromas are so subtle but you can pick everyone out.
Taste - Lots of ground coffee, oak and bourbon. I am also getting some spices, vanilla and cocoa. The flavors are really well balanced in this beer.
Feel - Full bodied creamy so smooth and warming from the bourbon.
Overall - This is a great beer, well balanced flavors nothing overpowers super smooth and just a great beer. 547 charactersDragginballs76, Apr 30, 2017

4.46/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5L - label is on point. As seems to be the norm with Jackie O's stouts, it pours thin-looking and with minimal head. Bubbles like cola. A gentle thin head forms and quickly dissipates, leaving large bubbles behind. Color itself is pretty damn black. 
S - bourbon and barley. Faint black coffee overpowered by booze and barrel. Wood chips, vanilla smoke, and lactosey chocolate. 
T - robust and chocolatey. Thick, full, milk chocolate and iced coffee. Heavy on the cream. There's an oaky bourbon bite and burnt embers. Light cinnamon and spice. Vanilla bean coffee and water chestnuts. Leaves a surprisingly bitter numbness in the mouth. The flavor is so rich and decadent that the biting hops and what I presume is booze burn come out of nowhere. 
F - smooth and rich, although not as thick as 11% would suggest. Almost seems light and dainty, making this worryingly dangerous. 
O - one of the more balance and tame JO stouts I've had. Seems to be their highest rated probably because they don't do crazy shit with this one. Authentic barrel flavor and beany coffee. 1,069 charactersagreenman19, Mar 25, 2017

4.61/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours viscous with almost no head to speak of; yet after that viscous pour, it sits cola brown in the glass with a fair amount of light passing through around the edges. Smell is heavily chocolate forward balanced nicely by a robust barrel character. The coffee comes through as the third most distinct smell. Slight hint of vanilla from the barrels along with some nice balanced roasted note. Taste follows the smell for the most part. Slightly sweet up front and the coffee comes through in the middle much more prevalently than in the nose.  The overall taste of the beer is very bourbon county esque with a slight roasty coffee note. Not a coffee bomb at all, though it still manages to peek out independently.  Also get some floral spicy notes that is a nice touch. It feels deliciously silky, but it is a tad too light. Something about the beer gives you a watery impression Tonito body but it objectively speaking rather thick and full bodied. Overall this beer is excellent but there is a lack of balance in the mouthfeel that prevents it from being truly world class. 1,076 charactersAmguerra305, Feb 12, 2017

Served in a snifter
2015
This beer pours black and is topped with less than an inch of mocha head that leaves very little lacing.
This beer is a year old so the coffee is faded but still present. The bourbon is faint and comes through with caramel and vanilla. 
I get coffee right away with some caramel and vanilla. The bourbon is subtle. The flavors combine wonderfully. 
Full, smooth mouthfeel
This is a fantastic beer even though some of the elements have faded due to me aging this beer for over a year. I have a 2016 that I will have to try soon to compare and update my review. Jackie O's never disappoints with barrel aged beers. 660 charactersbuschbeer, Jan 09, 2017

Taste is super smooth, roasty, nutty coffee with a great barrel complement.  Oak, vanilla, a hint of char, cinnamon and bitter chocolate notes.  Feel is low carb, and even a bit thin, but it definitely pushes all of the flavors up a notch.  Great beer, one of the best I've had in a while where all facets of the beer come together quite nicely. 455 charactersSaisonRichBiere, Dec 25, 2016

Appearance:  Pours pitch black with a tan film that fades to a ringlet; leggy, with spotty lacing
Smell:  RIch tones of Bourbon, chocolate, oak, walnut and coffee, of course
Taste:  Roast, Bourbon and chocolate, up front, with dark fruit and coffee tones developing through the middle; after the swallow, the heat builds, with the Bourbon (and to a lesser extent, the coffee) dominating the finish and lingering into the aftertaste
Mouthfeel:  Full bodied with low to moderate carbonation
Overall:  A bit boozy but filled with chocolate, coffee and Bourbon flavors; quite nice

4.68/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Bourbon barrel-aged Imperial Coffee Stout, with Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee from Stauf's Coffee Roasters in Columbus, Ohio. The pour is black, not too viscous, and sports a finger of brown foam that quickly dissipates. The smell is amazing. I get lots of chocolate and coffee, bourbon, toasted oak, cake batter, and freshly-baked cookies.
Full body with a creamy feel and a perfectly balanced flavor profile. Up front I taste toffee, bittersweet chocolate, and caramel cream. At mid-palate the roasted malt and coffee bitter things up a bit and bring with them the barrel character. The coffee is not in your face, but rather blends in with the other flavors. You know it's a coffee stout, but nobody is going to mistake this stuff for KBS or Big Bad Baptist. The barrel character, however, is quite prevalent. Lots of vanilla and toasted oak and just enough bourbon character to make the flavor nice and rich. You do get a little boozy heat, but nothing that overpowers the flavors or detracts from the drinkability. The coffee carries through to the back of the palate and lingers on the finish along with a fair amount of bourbon and alcohol warmth.
Overall, a phenomenal beer with no traces of oxidation or too much dark fruit or anything else that detracts from the bourbon, chocolate, and coffee. It is easily one of the best ``new beers'' I've purchased in quite some time. I think if the booziness could be dialed back just a bit, you'd have a masterpiece of a beer. I may let my other 2 bottles sit a while to smooth out some of the alcohol (the coffee isn't super strong as it is, so I'm not worried about it losing any punch). This is not a coffee stout aged in bourbon barrels. This is a big, beefy bourbon-barrel-aged stout with some coffee character. 1,768 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Dec 14, 2016

Pours a thick, viscous black body with a light brown small head that reduces to leave a ring of retention and no lacing. 
Aromas are heavy bourbon, vanilla, and coffee. On the tongue is sweet bourbon, smooth milk chocolate, freshly roasted coffee, and delicious roasty coffee aftertaste. Super drinkable for 12%. Medium heavy body with low carbonation. 
Extremely easy and tasty, perfect balance of coffee. 489 charactersgcamparone, Dec 06, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Celebrating my 1900th review with this one.  Poured into a Duvel tulip.
A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/4 inch tan head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves large clots behind.
S- The usual excellent synthesis of aromas I've come to expect from Jackie O's BA beers, this time including milk chocolate, coffee, nuts, vanilla and of course bourbon.
T- Chocolate is surprisingly the dominant flavor here, specifically milk chocolate which I attribute to the vanilla sweetness from the barrel.  The ABV is dangerously hidden from this beverage since this is something I could sip and sip and sip with reckless abandon.  The balance of this is stunning since the sweetness of the malt and barrel slide seamlessly into the roasty, charry finish.  Chocolaty aftertaste.
M- Robust and semi-creamy with medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- Amazing beer as usual from these guys.  My only criticism is the body isn't quite as decadent as hoped.  The coffee is well integrated into the flavor profile while not particularly standing out, which is fine given the high quality drink that was produced. 1,217 charactersImmortale25, Nov 29, 2016

Mouthful is medium to a bit thin but smooth.  Carbonation is low.  Finish is semi dry.
Bourbon and coffee and oak.  Balance and drinkability.  Very nice.  The downside is the mouthful being somewhat thin - very surprisingly for a BB stout.  Regardless, super enjoyable. 500 charactersSlack, Nov 12, 2016

long time want
poured into a perfect stout glass
completely black with a mocha head
coffee is in full force with this one as expected, comes across fantastic. deep roasted coffee, slight vanilla and burbon in the back
big roast and coffee upfront and center and all the way through. vanilla barrel sweetness in the back that cuts the coffee bitterness a little bit but the after test is still a bit bitter. was really hoping for more barrel tho, especially since label says it's been in the barrel for 11 months
feel is nice, thick bodied with a nice amount of carbonation.
overall this is an excellent beer, very well made. coffee comes thru completely. if your a coffee lover this is a must! not the as good as cycle coffees or bcbs but much better than most 800 charactersKevSal, Oct 30, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Description: No head or lacing to speak of and only a small amount of legs.  Dark black appearance, almost inky.  The smell was more wood/oak and bourbon than coffee, which I really only picked up a hint of.  No that that's bad, but just wan't what I expected.  Also some dark fruit (prune?) in there.  The coffee was much more apparent in the taste, both up front and on the back of the palate.  However, the coffee didn't overwhelm the beer as with some coffee stouts, which I appreciated.  Bourbon and oak were also noticeable as might be expected.  Feel was more creamy than syrupy and maybe a little thin but still very good.
Suggested food pairing: Dark chocolate
If you like this beer then you should also try: Bourbon Barrel Black Maple
Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again)  Best coffee stout I've ever had.  Really nice that the coffee was certainly noticeable and the star of the show without drowning out everything else.  Along with BBBM and Oro Negro, JO's has built a pretty impressive lineup of stouts/porters.  I'm already looking forward to what they'll come up with next! 1,131 charactersSHDoyle, Oct 23, 2016

Taste is everything you'd expect from the nose, refined coffee with strong barrel flavor without the spicy bite. Feel is a bit on the syrup-ie side but overall AWESOME stout and worth seeking out! 317 charactersBeantownBrews, Oct 16, 2016

Both bottles so far have had the faintest of hissing so I'm guessing very under carbed. 281 charactersfredmugs, Oct 14, 2016

4.21/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25The natural affinity that stout has with coffee is highlighted in Jackie O's collaboration with Stauf's Roasters, resulting in an imperial stout with a bold coffee lead. To top it off, a nice long bourbon barrel slumber softens the roasty edges but offers an opulent, savory taste throughout.
Savory and decadent to the nose, its fragrance billows over with nutty, soilish Jamaican coffee, oak, caramel, molasses, vanilla, dark fruit and chocolate. Dark brown and layered with a delicate coffee-like creme, its tawny crimson hues are off-black while its taste is toasty, cocoa, sherry-like and savory.
As the flavors develop across the middle, the beer's body is lighter than expected but its flavors are complex and bold. A delicate weave of date, fig and plum with a cherry-like balance to add richness and a pleasant acidic tang to the savory molasses, maple, chocolate and brown sugar. Earthy coffee rises as the stout continues to dry and its finish is roasty, oaky and spicy with peps of caramel, coconut and vanilla.
Full but relaxed, the bold flavors close with a dry, spicy and bouron-esque taste and texture. Lightly tannic to promote a powdery oak, and peppery, woodsy finish with the warmth of sherry and bourbon aligning on the after-palate. A long finish of coffee and molasses ensures a most dessert-like end to any session. 1,342 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 11, 2016

Served in a Jackie O's snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half tan head that stayed around for a while.  There's also a good amount of lacing.  I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like coffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak and chocolate.  It tastes pretty good too, there's lots of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, nuts, oak, chocolate, caramel, and a bit of coocnut flavors.  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation.  I thought this was a pretty good bourbon barrel aged coffee stout.  I know I'd like to try this one again in the future.  But then it is Jackie O's, so more often than not you know it's going to be really good!  $11.99 a bottle. 755 charactersbluejacket74, Oct 09, 2016

Smell: Beautiful. Oak (and I mean a lot of oak), some coffee, some bourbon, and some dark chocolate. Can't ask for more here.
Taste: Wow. This is the best Jackie O's I've had so far--and they have some really, really good dark beers. The coffee is out in front, but the bourbon and chocolate are strong. 
Mouthfeel: Alcohol well concealed. Smooth. Way too drinkable. Can't believe this is 12%. Reminds me of KBS, but maybe actually better in this area.
Overall: This is expensive, but I'm not at all disappointed. This is near perfect and my only disappointment is that the store had a one bottle limit. Absolutely incredible. 708 charactersDeFaz, Oct 08, 2016

3.67/5  rDev -18.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Body is black varnish, topped with half finger of tan, creamy head that quickly dissipates to leave a wine-like surface.
On the nose I get maple roasted nuts, chocolate syrup, and some vanilla as it warms. It's not terribly complex here, as there is some bourbon that is itching to take hold. I'm having this very fresh on draft and wondering if time will alter this. Older reviews on previous iterations of this beer are citing a bigger coffee presence, but normally coffee fades with time--maybe the barrel treatment produces the opposite effect.
Taste has a strong boozy heat to it, but it's not quite at the level so as to be overwhelming. The bourbon is cut by a sharp coffee element, but that woodiness just keeps coming on in waves, and the coffee is not as assertive as I'd like. However, flavor improves greatly as it warms--do not serve this too cold, which even the brewery is doing right now. Let this sucker warm up before even thinking about pouring it, let alone drinking it. Nuttier, bitter coffee emerges as it reaches temp, with a touch of roastiness and something sharp like sassafras root. 
Up front, the feel is extra dry, with lots of barrel oak. Body is thin yet oddly crisp and fizzy, but with the unusually dry intro, this is pretty drinkable. I can see how this is a big hit with a certain crowd, but beware of my review, I'm pretty fickle when it comes to BB beers.
Update: I've let this sit in the bottle a month and a half, and it does seem to be improving as someone else on here recommended.
Smell is better, with an essence of vanilla cream dollop stirred into some nice smooth coffee and a little melted chocolate. A little nutty barrel emerges as it warms, similar to BB Oil.
It's tasting less harsh and boozy, with some nice, softening, slightly sweetened chocolate milk mixed in to the rest of the elements I originally got when "fresh."
Still, it's surprisingly thin, like really thin, verging on watery.
For those that prefer liquor to beer, it makes sense for this one to have such high regard, but I like beer with a substantial mouthfeel, especially the big ones. 2,112 charactersSabtos, Oct 03, 2016

A- pours opaque black in color with a small foamy khaki colored head that reduces to a ring around the edge of the glass
S- aroma bursts with Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee, imparting floral notes, along with a distinct nuttiness & some dark chocolate.  Bourbon barrel pokes through, giving aromas of spicy charred wood, caramel, toasted coconut & vanilla bean.   Char and a bit of alcohol close out the nose
T- the floral and nutty character of the coffee follows the nose and comes out up front, along with some earthy notes.  Bourbon barrel kicks in mid-palate, with plenty bourbon, as well as caramel, vanilla & coconut.  The finish brings dark chocolate and some alcohol, with lingers of nutty coffee and alcohol
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel that continues into a warming finish
O- the coffee really comes through on this one, JMB imparts great nutty and floral notes and works well with the barrel aging 993 charactersTreyliff, Aug 07, 2016
4.16/5  rDev -8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Best part of this beer is the aroma. I get Lots of chocolate with some roasted coffee along with big bourbon notes including vanilla, toffee, and toasted coconut. Mouth feel is medium and carbonation is aggressive, but overly so. Most Jackie Os beers are too boozy for me so the taste doesn't quite follow the world class aroma. I don't Ned a very large pour of this, but I'm glad I got to try it and will keep an eye out for more Jackie Os. 441 charactersdanh53, Aug 04, 2016

Flavor is luxurious. Cocoa dominates, with bourbon accenting.  Coffee adds a modest bitterness to counter the slightly sweet malt bill. Very candy-like, with a bit of dark fruit mid palate. Finish is fairly hot, so I think another year of age would do this well. 448 charactersbarczar, Mar 11, 2016

Looks pretty average. Nice lace. Nose is one of the more unique ones I've come across in a coffee stout. Notes of roast, smoke, bacon, maple, chocolate, fudge and oak in the back. Strangely, there's some hash in there also. Pretty awesome though a bit mellow. Flavor is of chocolate, roast, maple syrup, molasses and espresso in the back. Sweet booze and fudge too. Chewy with a nice bit of heat at the end. Delicious! The feel is spot on also. Slick with just the slightest tickle of bubbles. Rich and heavy on the palate without being overwhelming. 
I'm a huge fan of coffee imperial stouts and this one's right up there with the best of them for me. Definitely worth seeking out. 789 charactersSpeedwayJim, Mar 05, 2016

Pours black, minimal head. Aroma is very intense coffee, some bourbon, alcohol. Taste follows with the addition of some dark chocolate alongside smooth coffee and some vanilla notes from the barrels. Aside from the coffee, not much roast characteristic. A bit boozier than expected. 
Mouthfeel was on the medium side of the spectrum. Well carbonated, perhaps a bit too much for my tastes with this style.
Overall, very good beer but a tad disappointing given the hype for me. 563 charactersinvertalon, Jan 21, 2016

Oh boy, big coffee, big barrel, reminds me initially of bcbcs - I'm salivating. Sip is soft at the beginning with huge coffee notes, a bit bitter from the cocoa/coffee beans.  Would not call this sweet, and even a bit thin but I'll wait for it to warm up to see if this changes at all.  Feel is soft as mentioned previously, coats the tongue with coffee and cocoa.  Now that it's warming up I was hoping it would thicken and sweeten but not much has changed. Overall an excellent beer, right up there with some of the better coffee stouts I've ever had, Jackie O's does barrel aging with the best of them, will definitely seek this out again! 753 charactersM_chav, Nov 20, 2015

A: Pitch-black pour with a tall and fizzy black head. Color drains quickly, as does the head itself. No lacing.
S: Heavy, heavy, heavy bourbon. Extremely bold caramel and toffee and oak notes. There is some sweet chocolate underneath but I don't even get any coffee in the aroma. It basically smells like pure bourbon but without the heat.
T: Again, extreme bourbon levels. Loads of caramel primarily. But now the coffee kicks in. Loads of fresh coffee beans with a crapload of sweet milk chocolate (probably more bittersweet but I think the bourbon is sweetening up the whole thing). Some roastiness and then into the finish you get another taste of that coffee, this time much more bitter along with tons of dark, decadent chocolate. Lingering caramel and oak with plenty of alcohol sting. 
M: Heavy, thick, lower carbonation. Syrupy as a result.
O: Another sensational Jackie-O's stout. HUGE stout flavors loaded with coffee, chocolate and bourbon. It's very sweet and very syrupy - drinkability does suffer a bit but the strong booziness helps cut it quite a bit. Flavors are bold and sharp and in-your-face. Not for the timid. Tremendously tasty stout. 1,177 charactersDope, Nov 13, 2015
4.92/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to thebouch01 for this bottle, which I’ve been looking forward to ever since it landed. And now that my wife is off having fun in D.C. - OK, she’s working - I’m busting it open. 375ML bottle split with no one. I hope she doesn’t read this. 
The pour is dank black, right up to the edges, with minimal head. The smell is cold-hearted coffee, with a bump of chocolate. The bourbon slips up on me only after several whiffs, but it’s there. What a relief. I find myself with a lot of coffee, bourbon, & chocolate beers of late. I hope it’s a trend that lasts longer than 21 Pilots. Or whatever they are. 
Champion Ground is more aggressive than a taunted pack of piranhas. I have to shake my head like Ash to clear it. Holy shit. There‘s more coffee in here than your average Nicaraguan county, & I can feel my bedtime ticking further into the future. I start to twitch & move faster. The bourbon sticks roots in the beans & lays down a field of boozy fire. Rich chocolate comes in & somehow overwhelms the other two mid-palate, & keeps running sweet right through the finish. Other notes: belly-warming alcohol, coffee, touch of spiciness, espresso, vanilla. And listing the ingredients is like stating that you had a hamburger at Mickie D’s vs. another at a Michelin-rated restaurant. They ain’t the same. Rich & creamy, with a drink ability that I could makes me wish I had three, or seventy, more bottles. 
There’s only one word to describe this beer: holy mother of all that’s holy. This is hands down the best Jackie O’s beer I’ve ever tasted & could hold it’s (quick vanishing) head high in any company. A stellar beer that's run me right out of superlatives, & one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Sorry, hon. 1,759 charactersmaximum12, Nov 13, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow!! For my 500th review on YouTube.
Pours out completely pitch black with a dark mocha looking head.
Aroma is coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, caramel and roast. Layers of different types of coffee.
Taste is layers and layers of espresso, dark roasted coffee, bourbon, dark/milk chocolate, vanilla and caramel. Bit of oak dryness and roasted malt notes too. Very complex with different notes being highlighted with each sip.
Body is lighter side of full and the mouthfeel is creamy. ABV is VERY well hidden and dangerously makes for a drinkable beer.
Another insane barrel-aged beer from Jackie O's! 610 charactersJohnnyMc, Nov 08, 2015

First whif is a bourbon booziness. Subtle coffee can be found behind. This is one of the best balanced bourbon stouts I've had. Like I'm drinking a fresh ground iced coffee with a bit of chocolate added a hint of oak and a shot of some quality bourbon. Very smooth rich feel. A tiny bit of water and oil going on, otherwise I'd push higher. Fantastic beer. 465 charactersHootie159, Oct 31, 2015

Aroma is plenty of spicy earthy coffee and a nice vanilla bourbon sweetness in the background. Bourbon and coffee are strong here. Flavor is lots of rich chocolate and bourbon, plenty of earthy delicious coffee, more oaky bourbon, light roast, lots of sweetness. Really smooth beer with a body that's a bit lighter than I'd usually expect from an imperial stout, but this is what seems to happen with JO's and it doesn't take much away. Still a big and rich beer with a strong bourbon influence. Good stuff.
Tried this again. Body seems beefed up a bit. Awesome! 661 charactersBMMillsy, Oct 07, 2015
4.2/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.252015 version. Very coffee forward beer. Some bitterness on back end. Some medium barrel aging comes through in taste and smell with mild alcohol notes. This became more prominent as beer warmed above 60 degrees. A stellar coffee beer. I prefer BCBCS though that's not really a knock against this brew.
Drank again. 2016 version with about 9 months age on it. Unimpressed this time. Coffee and stout flavors could both be stronger. Tastes more like a coffee brown ale to me without barrel aging. 495 charactersKevinpitts, Oct 06, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours black and thick almost like used motor oil with a short light brown head. It's as beautiful as any stout I've seen.
Smells sweet and boozy of course, but it also has plenty of exotic coffee aroma. I don't know much about coffee but for me this is smelling like walking down the coffee aisle at a fancy grocery store. I love that smell, although I'm not much of a coffee fan.
Tastes like it smells pretty much. The bourbon doesn't add a lot initially, I found it more in the lingering after taste, although it certainly feels boozy. It tastes especially creamy, Jackie O's knows how I like my coffee. There is just the right amount of coffee bitterness, too. Some chocolate coming along for the ride, too.
Feels pretty heavy and boozy, which is what I look for in my BA stouts, but it still manages to be very easy to drink. The bourbon is also a little noticeable in the lingering taste and warmth in my mouth and throat. Very relaxing.  
Overall, this is the best barrel aged coffee stout and the best Jackie O's offering I've ever had. Easiest five stars I've ever given. 1,083 charactersBeef_Curtains, Sep 13, 2015

Summery: Mega smooth, rich tasty BBA coffee stout. Tons of complexity going on, yet is smooth and pleasant on the palate. I have been a critic of Jackie O's BA stouts due to their price. This one is worth every penny hands down. The last 3 Jackie O's bottles I have had (Wood Ya Honey, Oro Negro and this one) have just really knocked my socks off. The coffee, barrel and  base stout that went into the barrel play well off each other. It's fantastic and worth seeking~ 660 charactersClePaul, Sep 11, 2015

Lots of chocolate, vanilla, coffee, bourbon and some nuttiness with the roasted malt. Everything comes through balanced and not "too much". Reminds me of the balance of added flavors that BOMB! has (one of my favorite flavored stouts). I will be seeking this out again. 368 charactersKSOZE, Sep 10, 2015

Overall one of, if not the best, beer I have ever had.  
Look was black, head resembled chocolate milk in color and consistency.
Smell of caramel and coffee
The taste of bourbon, coffee and chocolate are well balanced.
The feel is smooth and finishes exceptional smooth.
Overall this beer is nearly perfect. 350 charactersmkessler, Sep 06, 2015

The beer looks great - a fleeting brown head over a body dark as a dubplate spinning in a dim dancehall on a Kingston night. The smell is coffee driven, along with the barrel, and has just a hint of vanilla as well. The taste is off the hook - just a great blend of coffee, chocolate, bourbon and just enough sweetness. Booze is well hidden; mouthfeel is luscious. Just a hair off the mark from being the perfect coffee stout...great blend of flavors. Collie, we want someting..really and truly and truly high grade. 627 charactersjampics2, Sep 06, 2015
4.73/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 375 bottle into a Jackie O's snifter. 
It is oil black in color, and somewhat in consistency. There is a decent amount of khaki colored head for a barrel aged beer. It also retains a nickel thick ring the entire time. 
Smells mainly like a straight up Russian Imperial Stout. Deep roasted malts, chocolate, and a subtle coffee in the background.  The bourbon is noticeable, but doesnt jump out of the glass. Vanilla like sweetness and wood. 
It smelled excellent, but it tastes just as good. Crazy good. Initial chocolate, vanilla, and caramel along with molasses/brown sugar all dance together in front of a backdrop of oak and expresso like coffee. The coffee really creeps in toward the end, and shines more and more as it warms. The coffee is very, very smooth and I wouldn't say subtle, but mellow (seems fitting given the theme).
 I don't think I can overstate how well balanced the bourbon and coffee flavors are. They really allow the base beer to shine on it's own, only adding a complement. Just a touch of heat to let you know the alcohol is there. Aftertaste is reamrkable though. No bitterness at all. Which is crazy considering the lingering dark chocolate flavor with the roasted coffee beans. 
It is not chewy thick like a Ten Fidy, but above average. A nice slick viscosity. Carbonation is moderate. 
I give this one a near perfect score in taste based on the near perfect balance I believe they achieved. If you are at all hesitant about the coffee, or the bourbon barrel aspect, I strongly suggest giving it a try. Nothing is overpowering at any point. This one would be behind Bourbon County Coffee, but as good or better than KBS, Big Bad Baptist, or Weyerbacher Sunday Morning for me as far as barrel aged coffee beers go. If you are looking for something more along the lines of coffee bombs, you might not enjoy this as much as I did though. I think this is definitely one of Jackie O's top 3, if not their best, and that is impressive on it's own. 1,992 charactersWesMantooth, Sep 06, 2015

Scents of chocolate, espresso, bourbon. Smooth, well balanced flavors. Sticky vanilla mouthfeel, infused with Staufs roasted coffee. I'm a dark roast coffee kind of guy, so would have preferred an even stronger coffee flavor. Very curious to try BCBCS now and compare. 386 charactersSwettenham_Shire, Sep 06, 2015

Taste follows nose with sweet barrel caricature of vanilla caramel and oak, coffee is soooooooo smooth, opposed to that bitter grounds taste you get form some others. It's clear that using Jamaica blue grounds made a difference between a good coffee stout and a great coffee stout. The barrel is a great compliment and does not take center stage. Texture is awesome, thick without being chewy and silky smooth. Overall this is a phenomenal beer. This is one of the best BBA coffee stouts I've ever had (including. Bcbcs, coffee cake, etc)  because all of the flavors are standouts without being overpowering. They made a concious decision to use some of the most expensive beans and made sure not to crush those flavors with a barrel, everything just balances so well. One of the best 375s they've put out. 908 charactersbrewtus, Sep 04, 2015
4.56/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5L: An opaque black. Minimal head, and most of what there is clings to the sides of the glass. 
S: Magnificent. Begins with a soft, rich bourbon character which gives way to coffee near the end. 
T: A lot of flavors are present, but not so much that anything is muddled. The bourbon sits nicely atop the stout base, and the usual flavors of oak, vanilla, and toasted coconut are present. The coffee is perfectly integrated with the other flavors. There isn't the excessively roasty flavor that you can get with some less expertly-blended coffee stouts. Sweetness is kept nicely in check and alcohol is not present on the flavor.
F: Rich and silky. There's no doubt this is a big beer, but it moves smoothly through the palate without fatigue setting in. 
Overall, this is either my favorite bottled Jackie O's 375 or, if not, is a very close second to BBBM. Seek it out if you can. 881 charactersmasterofsparks, Sep 04, 2015

S: smells of nice bourbon and a light hint of coffee. 
T: a direct BCBCS competitor. Tastes of roasted malt and slight, not overbearing bourbon. Obviously coffee is a big flavor here, as well as oak and mild hints of vanilla. While drinking I honestly forgot it was 11%, it goes down that smoothly. 
F: Silky smooth and rich, but still has a good thickness to it. 
Overall this might be my favorite BA stout, and definitely my favorite coffee stout I've tried. A spectacular showing from those guys down in Athens 584 charactersEvanMaldonado, Sep 03, 2015

4.78/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Nailed it!  The best way I can describe this is a good middle ground between bourbon-heavy coffee stouts (bcbs or Sunday morning) and the more coffee forward like kbs.  
It starts like a mellowed out iced coffee and transitions to a quick flash of chocolate before it finishes with subtle bourbon heat.  By comparison I would take this over kbs, Sunday morning and a coin toss against bcbcs.  
We'll with tracking this down, jackie o's continues to crush it with their stouts and barrel aging program. 503 charactersBuckeyeBeers, Sep 03, 2015

T: Reminds me of Bourbon County with less booze.  Bourbon is spot on, but not so much that it mutes the coffee.  Oak, vanilla, roasted malt, and cholocalte present as well.

Pours a dark black with a minimal beige head.
Very stong roast coffee aroma with some dark choclate and a slight bourbon nose.
Dark chocolate seems to dominate with a good compliment of Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee that gives way to a nice bourbon barrel finish.
Smooth chocolately mouthfeel that is surprisingly easy to drink.
Overall this is one of my favorite BA coffee stouts that i've had.  Not overly sweet and this is definitely a beer to drink right out of the cellar or let it warm up a little.  Enjoy now for the coffee but this will definitely be a great cellar dweller as well.  Well done again Jackie O's!! 656 characterswhitenads, Aug 30, 2015
4.79/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a pitch black with a thicc fluffy light brown head. The nose is slightly muted, but has aromas of dark malts, chocolate, bourbon and nicely roasted coffee. The taste is a bomb of dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, loads of bourbon and loads of coffee. Stauf's is an excellent roaster and Jackie O's is an amazing brewer. Put the two together and you get a top line barrel aged coffee stout. One worth seeking out and having whenever it's available. 458 characterszimm421, Aug 30, 2015
4.71/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This might be one of the best bb coffee stouts I've had. As a result, I'll give it a proper review. This beer is a blend of BB Oil and BB Dark App with Stauf's Jamaica Blue Mountain. 
L: Pours dark, pitch black motor oil. I feel the abyss looking back at me. It has a tan head that dissipates quickly, to leave some lacing. 
S: Coffee. Not muted, not overdone, perfect. It works in symphony with the bourbon perfectly. They aren't in competition as I often feel is the case with many of these beers. There is a strong oak presence which takes the form of vanilla, toasted coconut, and caramel. 
T: Follows the nose, this beer is big and it knows it. Are we sure there isn't vanilla added, because this tastes like bourbon vanilla coffee dark app in a barrel. Fudgy chocolate is there on the taste that isn't present on the smell. There is no acidity from the coffee, which I get from many other big coffee stouts. The coffee and bourbon are smooth and work in harmony. The only reason this beer is not perfect is that toasted coconut isn't super there on the taste. But I'm not sure I'd want it to be with the vanilla coffee goodness. 
F: Pours like motor oil, feels like motor oil. This isn't thin. 1,203 charactersBWCampbell, Aug 29, 2015
