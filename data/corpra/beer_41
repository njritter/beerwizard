The nose had a lot of citrus fruit with pine and spices. The flavor has a ton of citrus fruit with a splash of tropical fruit, earthiness, and finishes with the slightest bit of pine. The feel is medium, well carbonated, and slightly resinous. This beer is outstanding! Well worth all the praise it gets and I will definitely seek it out again. 424 charactersMeyers1023, Feb 09, 2017

4.59/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Finally able to track this thing down and had massive expectations.. double citra (when fresh) is one of my all time favorite beers that I've ever had the pleasure to sip on so when they describe this and double citra meets double galaxy - you know it's gonna be an instant favorite. "when fresh" as mentioned above is important as I live in New Mexico and have only ever been able to try HF hops through the means of trading and I very rarely am able to try them within the recommended drink by date that HF prints on their tags.  I had an incredible pour of double citra the first time I got to it, the next was from a growler that had a marked "drink by" date from a 8 days prior (so probably 13 day old growler by that time)... and was really bad.  So in my experience, the hoppy beers in growlers from HF fall off extremely fast.... that said, if you are lucky enough to enjoy any of their hoppy beers within the recommended time, I envy you. HF is the best in my opinion. Rant over, now lets drink:
January 16th, 2017 - shipper didn't want to send out until a tuesday because of low temps in the NE - which I completely understand, but this meant I wouldn't receive the ground shipping until 6 days later and after a weekend. Recommended drink by date on this tag was Jan 13th
L - light golden hazy look with a frothy top and sticky lacing showing the 8% abv
S - there is it, the fresh hopped grapefruit and papaya, the danky galaxy is dominant but the tropical citra is seducing as always.
T - delicate candied orange and grapefruit, danky resin and a lite bread backbone, this is great.
F - super soft, without already knowing this was an Imperial IPA I would have probably guessed at an abv closer to 6%, its way too crushable.
O - and outstanding offering from HF and one that I will absolutely seek out once again, I can only imagine that this may be slightly better when enjoyed from the tap, instead of 9 days removed from the pour date. 1,950 charactersM_chav, Jan 17, 2017

Appearance is a murky, yellow-orange, with a tall, thick, creamy head that coats the glass.  Aroma is a medley of tropical fruits with a hint of herbal/spice hops, not super aromatic.  Taste is delicious.  Mango, pineapple, orange, a hint of spice, a soft, muted bitterness on the finish.  Mouthfeel is about perfect.  Overall, an incredible DIPA, a little pricey, but glad I had it. 442 charactersFFreak, Dec 05, 2016

4.41/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery 11/02/16. Served in a tulip.
Pours an opaque golden-pear colour with a finger-plus of ivory suds. Retention is good for a few minutes and leaves a thick ring of foam and generous amounts of lacing.
Smells of limes, clementines and vanilla sugar cookies.
The taste upfront is a melange of bitter citrus, lemons, both juice and pith, limes, orange peel and grapefruit juice... are there any citrus fruits I missed? Them, too. After the initial citrus assault, there's papaya, lots of pine sap and sugar cookies. Earthy and resinous, finishing with a long, lightly-lingering, tongue-coating citric bitterness.
Feel is light-to-medium-bodied, crisp, with bright carbonation and a dank zippiness.
Overall, as straightforward, bad-ass, full-on, high alpha citrus NEDIPA as they come. Totally forgot about the whole 8% abv thing until I tried to get up off the sofa. 908 characterspapposilenus, Nov 04, 2016

An orange pale yellow color. A little over one finger white head that faded slowly leaving some lacing. 
The smell is fruity citrus with some spicy scent. I taste more tangerine in this one. 
Some acidic body and more carbonated than necessary. 
The tangerine and hops goes great together. A world-class beer with a great bitter finish. Hill Farmstead is becoming one of my favorite breweries. 491 charactersKdouble, Oct 20, 2016

3.55/5  rDev -22.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.25On-draught @ Torst in Brooklyn at $13 per 14oz pour.
APPEARANCE: Frothy off-white creamy head atop a hazy orange body. Retention is good - about 10 minutes. 3-4cm of head. Leaves nice even coating on the sides of the glass as it recedes.
AROMA: Resinous and floral, with blossoming citrus. Pale malts even out the hops. 
Average aromatic intensity.
TASTE: Bends a bit into the new world hop tropical camp, evoking orange creamsicle, tangerine zest, and even a bit of pineapple - not a flavour I'm a fan of in a beer. The mango and papaya are nice. Resinous and floral enough to satisfy, but the prominent tropical fruit flavour isn't really up my alley. 
Slightly imbalanced, but the pale malts do a good job fighting the hop bitterness. I'm not dazzled by the hop profile, but it's nice enough.
TEXTURE: Slightly scratchy and dry in the third act and finish, but otherwise smooth and wet for the most part. A bit overcarbonated. No booziness or heat here.
OVERALL: Not a dazzling imperial IPA like its reputation suggests (I hoped for more flavour), but certainly an enjoyable one. I wouldn't buy it again at this price, but I'm glad I got to try it. Drinkability is on par with the ABV.

L-nice clarity, thick white head, nice lacing
S-earthiness really stands out, certainly some unique citrus notes too...some grapefruit, but i get a lot of mango, papaya, orange, and melon too
T-the complexity and balance of the earthiness, pine, citrus really comes through in the taste.  All of the same from the smell comes through and comes through exceptionally well
F-creamy, kind of heavy, but so smooth and easy to drink...nice bitter back end too
Overall-one of my favorite of the HF IPAs, probably second or third after Abner and maybe Double Citra.  I really enjoyed this.  Very unique, especially when considered how the style is changing these days.  This is a Classic East Coast IPA and one of the best out there.  Thanks Shaun! 779 charactersrabbott2, Aug 29, 2016

I wasn't as impressed with this as I thought I'd be, there are others in this style I liked better. There was a background dankness I couldn't get my brain to move past. But it's a great beer and I had no problem finishing the growler with a friend during a ski weekend. 514 charactersGeeL, Aug 23, 2016

It pours a milk pale yellow-orange tone with a modest white head that fades to a ring. Leaves lacing.
The aroma is alive with citrus, fruity and spicy characters. Cantaloupe and tangerine.  Light toasted bread under currant.
The body is medium to bold but there is an acidic fuzziness to it.
The taste is a hop heads delight with all that tangerine and cantaloupe juiciness mixing with a citrus cleanliness leading to ma juicy, yet crisp and bitter finish.  Another topnotch offering from this Vermont brewery. 598 characterspuboflyons, Aug 21, 2016

Pours a very hazy light golden orange color. Almost looks like sludgy orange juice with a nice fluffy off white head. Smells like oranges and tangerines. Very explosive aroma. Tastes like orange and citrus juice. Also has a candy like or maybe a creamsicle flavor. Crazy good. Almost no bitterness to be found. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy. The other HF IPA's and IIPA's I've had seem restrained. This one is not. The hoppiness is unapologetic. What an awesome brew! Wish I could drink it all the time. 681 charactersdaudelin2000, Jul 17, 2016

Tangerine, melon.
Absolutely pops, nothing subtle about it. Orange juice-esque and not even a tad dry. Was there a bittering hop in this beer? Better than any single hop galaxy or citra I've had, the combination is perfect. Guilty of being one note but still incredible.
Carbonation feels right. 325 characterspants678, May 12, 2016

4.99/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.
Pours a murky golden straw color with a generous white head. Leaves lots of clingy, soapy lacing. Excellent retention. 
The aroma is mindblowing. I get loads of citrus up front; orange and grapefruit, a touch of tangerine, followed by some tropical fruit notes. There's a subtle pine needle aroma that sticks out just enough to let you know it's there. The pale malt is sweet and doughy, and subtly present. 
The taste follows the nose perfectly. Sweet orange citrus, bittersweet grapefruit, tangerine, some mango and peaches, all balanced out by a bitter pine flavor that is gone as quickly as it hits your palate. Bright and juicy. Just amazing. 
The feel, as with most HF IPA's, is soft, creamy, and smoother than Billy Dee Williams. Medium-light carbonation. The finish is not too dry and has just a faint lingering bitterness. 
Overall, Hill Farmstead has now brewed my two favorite beers. Double Citra, and this masterpiece. It's pretty much the perfect DIPA, in my humble opinion. It's juicy and fruity, but has enough pine and malt to balance out the sweetness and add depth to an already delicious beer. I have yet to give out a perfect 5, but this is as close as it gets. 1,231 charactersScaryEd, Apr 20, 2016

A= A light orange hazy pour with a foamy head that is just barely off-white.  Sticky lacing.
S= Big citrus aroma, mostly orange juice, zest, and pith.  Some tropical notes in the background but orange is quite powerful.
T= Tons of juicy fruit goodness.  Orange juice still strong in the flavor, mango, tropical fruits, some grapefruit hints.  Super tasty.
M= Moderate carbonation, medium body.
O= This may be my new favorite from HF.  So fresh and inviting.  Aroma and flavor are top notch.  Juicy as can be. 564 charactersjhavs, Jan 30, 2016

This one pours a hazy, murky and turbid looking mess, bright and sunshiny and so inviting. There's a one inch head, and lots of lacing.
Smells so inviting, just a fruity bomb of a beer, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, orange, and melon. I can pick out each hop pretty well in the aroma, which is cool.
This has gotta be up there with the juiciest beers ever. There's just so much here- it's like sucking the hops straight off the branch. There's tons of fruit, as described the atoroma- they're all there- with orange and pineapple being the leaders in dominance. There's a hint of catty and piney bitterness at the end, with some slight earthy flavors too. This is just near perfect.
This has a really creamy mouthfeel, with a super juicy finish, mostly juicy but slightly dry with a little bitterness. It's an drinkable it's just stupid.
Unbelievable. One of the pinnacles of American hop mastery, in my humble opinion. In my top 5 IPAs of all time. Within Hill Farmstead, only 2nd to Abner. I am in awe. 1,062 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 27, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look:  Straw yellow with hints of amber; totally cloudy, completely opaque.  Pours with a thick, 2 finger, white cloud-like head that dies down very slowly leaving a thick, uneven layer of foam on the surface of the beer and large amounts of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  Perfect!
Smell:  Fresh cut grass, loads of citrus (think grapefruit), slight aroma of pine, acidic finish.  Smells delicious and inviting.
Taste:  Slight grassy-start, followed by a bold, citrus middle (grapefruit), with a mildly tart lemony citrus finish.  No dry-bitter taste at all.  Awesome!
Feel:   Heavier-side of medium body.  Rich, velvety feel to start; then a mild fizzy sensation from the carbonation, ending with slight pucker at the end.  Refreshing - almost zero dryness at the finish. 
Overall:  I believe this is the best DIPA that I have ever had.  Love it!  I could drink this one over and over! 901 characterssprat1960, Jan 25, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in an opaque gorgeously sunset golden orange.
The aroma jumps out of apricot, nectarine, mango, passionfruit, tangerine, dried tropical fruit, some dank quality.
The flavor follows with tropical fruit gum, dried mango, dried stone fruit, candied tangerine, a white bready malt in the middle, lingering fruit along with a soft herbaceous bitterness, along with a dank aftertaste.
A true masterpiece of a DIPA. I could never get tired of this. 459 charactersdar482, Sep 09, 2015

Taste is bright orange and citrus with a crisp bitter finish.  Nice bitterness on the back-end with a peppery mouth-feel.  The citrus washes out with a hoppy bitter feel stays for a bit.  Really, really excellent showing from Hill Farmstead.  This is world class. 373 charactersanteatr23, Sep 08, 2015

Served in a snifter
Outstanding appearance. The cloudy, yellow ochre liquid was topped by a one-finger finger tall, frothy, bright white head. Drippy sheets of lacing trickled along the glass. The head dropped to a thick, bubbly, lasting ring.
The aroma was phenomenal. Uber hoppy and fruity with loads of tropical fruit notes. Passionfruit dominated. Peach and apricot also came through strong. There was an intensely dank, marijuana-like quality as well. Semi sweet. Juicy tangerine notes were apparent. Touch of citrusy tartness.
The flavor profile was similar to the nose and just as stellar. Peach and mango notes hit hard right off the bat. Incredibly fruity and tropical. Passionfruit again came through super strong. Good dose of mango. Really juicy. Tangerine was detectible. There was a slight lemony tartness on the back end. The beer finished with just a touch of grapefruit rind-like bitterness.
The mouthfeel was pillowy soft and fluffy. Creamy and slick on the palate. For the style, a bit lighter bodied than expected yet so smooth.
Just when I thought I had tried the best that Hill Farmstead has to offer, another beer comes along that makes me rethink just how amazing their beer really is. Society & Solitude #4 is possibly the most tropical fruit-forward double IPA I have ever encountered. This beer definitely ranks up there as one of my all-time favorites. 1,429 charactersDamian, Sep 04, 2015

Appearance: Hazy yellow-gold. Head is bright-white, pillowy, and dense. Minimal retention. Leaves a couple chunks of cap with a small dense collar. Splotches and ropes of sticky lacing. Moderate carbonation on the pour.
Smell: Juicy tropical fruit explosion. Tons of peach and nectarine. Solid push of pine needle, grapefruit and orange zest and juice. Green onion and weed. So much peach it's actually a bit nuts. Juicy and macerated peach flesh. Sweet in good measure. Malt base offers a touch of a bready element with some pale malt sweetness. Resin. A touch of lemongrass thrown in the back. Incredibly dank under the sweetness. 
Taste: Peach flavored weed. Super dank and super tropical. Peach flesh and juice in abundance. Oily and resinous pine. Pine needle. Touches of lemon and pineapple as well. Malts offer up a solid backbone with a slight biscuity sweetness with some bready elements. Pale malt. Some green onion. Bursts of grapefruit juice and zest. General citrus juice. A spicy and floral hop runs throughout. Tons of white nectarine as well. Fruity to the point where it's almost a candied sweetness. Lingering bitterness that almost hits aspirin. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Juicy and a touch creamy through the sip. Relatively  high astringency with a decent dryness overall.
Overall: Double down every time.
These two hops always play well together and this is absolutely no exception. It's intense and almost overbearing but not quite. It might be the most peach forward thing I've had that didn't have peaches in it. 1,578 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Aug 29, 2015

Consumed 8/29/15
A: Medium tangerine, with some golden honey - glows in the light - hazy, cloudy, with some clarity around the edges - medium sized, fluffy, off-white head, fades to a mostly solid, wispy cap, leaves some streaks and blobs of lacing
S: Stunning? Paralyzing? Magical? I have been smelling this for a while, and I can't get over it - fresh squeezed, ripe tropical fruit juice - bright, bright orange, tangerine, and grapefruit juice, flesh  floral citrus - tons of stone fruit, ripe peach flesh, peach juice, apricots - massive tropical push, with mango, pineapple, and passion fruit - fruity - straight-up hops, hop resin, pine, and a touch of mint - herbal notes - pale malts at the base, extremely clean, no hints of alcohol
T: Juicy, fruity, big - massively hoppy, which is not a surprise - orange, tangerine, grapefruit, ruby red grapefruit - citrus, juice, flesh, and some oil, zest - an array of stone and tropical fruits - peach flesh, apricot, pineapple, mango, passion fruit - hop resin, pine, and some herbal flavors - moderate bitterness that tastes a little more herbal and grassy than expected - clean. pale malts, lightly sweet, touch of caramel, finishes clean
M: Medium body, very smooth, excellent carbonation, finishes clean
O: Can I actually drink this with my nose?
I'm slightly confused by some of the other reviews I am now skimming through, as they suggest that the aroma is not potent. Maybe this quickly fades over time, or maybe this batch is just hyper fresh. Regardless, this is one of the best smelling IPAs I have had in a long time. It's magical. Even compared to other Hill Farmstead DIPAs, this is notable. The taste does not quite fulfill the promises of the aroma, but it's still very lovely. 1,809 charactersangrybabboon, Aug 29, 2015

T: Meyer lemon, grapefruit and pineapple shine. Very well balanced, with a bit of sweetness up front but finishing dry and hoppy.
F: Soft but crisp feel. Nice full body, but not too full. Little to no booziness.
O: This is a world-class beer for sure. Not my favorite from the brewer, but I already can't wait to drink it again. 535 charactersCayseyW, Aug 29, 2015

A - The same as all the rest.  Seriously, every HF IPA looks exactly the same.  A pale, hazy yellow-orange with a bright, pillowy white head.  Nice.
N - Hmm, I like these hops.  The nose is tropical fruit and citrus, with no bitterness at all.  And that's my favorite kind of IPA - hoppy but not bitter.
T - Good!  Definitely a tad more bitter than the nose, but I get the bright, juicy floral hops, plenty of citrus.  A very nice example of the style.
M - HF always nails it here.  Frothy and coating everywhere.  Always impressive.
O - I pretty much give all of their IPAs the same grade, and I'll do the same here.  Another great one. 724 charactersCraftFan5, Aug 27, 2015

S- tropical notes, mango, lemon zest, orange, and grassy notes. Smell isn't so powerful, but very present.
T- perfectly balanced with just the right hop flavor. A truly excellent beer. I get more tropical notes, grapefruit, pineapple, pine.
F- creamy, if not pillowy. Mild carbonation, just enough to make my taste buds dance.
O- I can't say enough positive about it. The flavor is just impeccably and precisely on point. It's delicate yet aggressive and definitely sets a high bar. 596 characterspja786, Aug 26, 2015

T-  very fruity and juicy.  Very enjoyable and all the citrus from the nose has not disappeared on the taste.  This one was a little different than the other IPAs on tap, as it had a slight bitterness at the end, but it was an enjoyable bitter.  Almost a little tart, but very smooth and refreshing.
M-  medium bodied, a smooth light creaminess with medium carbonation.
O-  another really great IPA from HF.  I feel like this brewery can't mess up a beer.  I could drink this or any if their beers all day, every day. 731 charactersEveningCordial, Jul 11, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A - Hazy golden-orange body, essentially translucent.  Big, persistent white head, big lacing.
S - Smacks the nose around with all kinds of hop wildness.  Dank, cat, tropical notes, bodies, all mingled together.  Some notes attract, some repel, but definitely interesting, and not surprising given the hop bill.
T - But if the nose is all over the place, the taste dials in on the pure hop dream of citrus.  Orange juice, grapefruit pith, zest.  It is powerful stuff, but the tightrope is walked, and it lands clean.  The close is surprisingly mild, crisp, without the stinging bitterness one might expect.
M - This is shockingly clean, crisp, with only mild drying right in the tail end.
O - Rock solid, a double I'd drink any time I could get it, for certain.  The only detraction is a wildness in the nose, which fortunately is still largely appealing.  The taste and feel are simply amazing.  Awe-inspiring work. 920 charactersTsar_Riga, Jul 10, 2015

I had it the day after Double Citra and found many of the same notes (the sweet, ripe citrus and tropical notes in the nose and taste) but also with a bitmore of a bittering hop bit in the finish.  These guys have the Midas Touch right now! 341 charactersmtomlins, Jul 08, 2015

Most breweries would kill to be able to produce a beer this good. Yet, at Hill Farmstead, it's not even a Top 3 beer. 
My only complaint is that when I mixed a growler of Double Citra with a growler of Double Galaxy, it tasted even better than S+S #4. 
That being said, this is still a beer that is worth buying every time it is available. 370 charactersrodmanfor3, Apr 19, 2015

Nose is a bit subdued - citrus zest and a hint of spice and sweet citrus towards the back.  Taste follows nose - even and drinkable with a little rind at the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to light, with an even, mild carbonation.  All and all, a dangerously drinkable beer, but not my favorite hoppy offering from HF. 459 charactersJwale73, Apr 03, 2015

A: Pours a very hazy apricot and leaves a fluffy couple fingers of white head which take a while to fade, leaving some white atop the beer. (4.5)
S: Juicy citrus, tropical fruits, some floral hops, a touch of spruce, and some creamsicle. Full of delicious fruit flavors, no off flavors at all. (4.75)
T: Big grapefruit, pineapple, apricots, a bit of spruce, some grassy/earthy notes. Very drinkable, full of hoppy deliciousness. (4.75)
M: Medium, slightly creamy body, medium carb with some juiciness in the body. (4.5)
O: A really well done, aggressively hoppy (especially citrus and tropical) IPA that is very drinkable. Hopheads will definitely enjoy this one, as did I. (4.75) 789 charactersResuin, Mar 12, 2015

Pours a deep orange, hazy unfiltered body with a generous white head, reducing fairly quickly but leaving blotchy white lacing. 
Bright, fresh, tropical aromas shine through the foam - pineapple, fresh citrus, raw hops, slight buttery aromas come through at times. 
On the tongue is an explosion of fresh hops, a nice combination of juicy tropical fruits and delicious dank, resinous zing. Citrus, grapefruit, pineapple. Malt backbone is there -this makes for a nice, medium body with medium-low carbonation. 
I didn't expect anything less from HF - where some of the best IPAs in the world are brewed. Perfectly balanced, super flavorful, and an absolute enjoyment to drink. 786 charactersgcamparone, Mar 09, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +4.8%Reviewed from notes, fresh growler shared by Liam.
Pale orange colour, 2 fingers of white head with some lace as well. Smell is hoppy with a nice mix of juicy tropical and citrus flavours, honeydew melon and tangerine with a light crackery malt closer. Taste has lots of honeydew melon and fruit, tropical, moderate bitterness mixed with hop flavours, dry throughout and into the finish. Lightly carbonated, medium-full body, fairly oily. Exceptional, probably the best DIPA I have had to date. 495 characterspeensteen, Sep 17, 2014

Appearance: cloudy and glowing yellow bodied beer with a large 3 fingers worth of creamy bubbly white head that leaves thick lacing everywhere on the side of the glass. Head has great staying power and drops down to a clumpy and uneven cap on the beer.
Smell: Orange and tropical fruit bomb. Hint of pine. Extremely juicy and slightly dank hops. 
Taste: Mild to moderate hop bitterness. So much oranges flavor its not funny. Tangy and sweet oranges. Mango, papaya, and a hint of pineapple for good measure. Bready malts balance the beer nicely while still allowing all that hop goodness to be the main event.
Mouthfeel: Almost, but not quite a medium bodied beer with low almost moderate carbonation. Very creamy mouthfeel with this DIPA. If I didn't know any better, I would have sworn that I was drinking an APA. Extremely drinkable DIPA.
Overall: This beer is just like blending my favorite attributes of both PsuedoSue and Double Sunshine into one fantastic hoppy beer. I prefer this ever so slightly over Abner, but S&S4 is my favorite DIPA thus far from Hills Farmstead. These Hill Farmstead hops are among the best in the nation. This is the best hoppy beer that I have ever drank. To this point when I talked about my favorite DIPA it was always Double Sunshine; and that's been long standing for several years. Now, my new favorite DIPA is definately S&S4. I gotta say that my first trip to the east coast has opened my eyes to the fact that the east coast hoppy beers are the best in the nation. Between Hill Farmstead and Lawsons they have hoppy beers perfected. And Toppling Goliath hops are of the same world class caliber. 1,683 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jul 17, 2014

This beer pours a beautiful hazy golden. The smell is of rich tropical fruits, with a hint of pine. 
The taste? Unreal. Beautiful hints of tropical fruit with just a touch of pine, a touch of sweetness, and perfect carbonation. The bitterness is there, but it is very low.... much lower than I am used to for this style, and that is perfect. 
I could drink this beer every day for the rest of my life. This is one brewery that actually lives up to the hype. 600 charactersJsmick, Jul 15, 2014

4.41/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a nice, frothy snow-white head. Retention is good, and very nice long lines of lacing persist. Brew is a pulpy, almost completely opaque light orange color.
Peppery hop notes first greet my nose (similar to NZ hop varietals), carrying tropical and light citrus notes as well. There is a sweet but understated malt presence; very much there, but not allowing itself to upstage the hops.
Flavor indeed follows the nose: very soft and subtle tropical fruits, peppery spice, and a long, muted citrus peel finish. Just a tiny hint of dankness at the end. Malt balance throughout is soft, creamy, and superb; very light biscuit and bread. Brew is intensely bitter, but incredibly approachable despite.
Long, long finish; very lively, with no sting; minimal foaming; juicy. I think medium is right about on for feel, with a huge, juicy, sticky lingering finish. The bitterness really cleanses your mouth on the finish, leaving you begging the next sip. Absolutely no hint of alcohol.
This reminds me of all the rare, sought-after new-hop-varietal big DIPAs made on the West coast, but with the soft, creamy mouthfeel that, to me, makes HF special. Fruity and peppery hops are showcased, somehow both bold and upfront, yet subtle and balanced with the malts.
Yet another superb beer. My favorite S&S? I'm thinking no, but absolutely delicious, nonetheless. 1,359 charactersRoguer, Jul 11, 2014

Smells amazing when the growler is popped. A very sweet fruit smell.
The taste is a lot of tangerine and mango with sweetness up front and then a long lingering bitterness on the end with a pine aftertaste. Some sticky-ness at the end.
It was pretty heavily carbonated out of the growler at first (assuming from transport), but generally a lighter carbonation, decent head, just clinging to the glass.
Wish this was more readily available. 478 charactersJandJMD, Jul 09, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've heard a lot about Hill Farmstead and the beers that I've had from Hill Farmstead prior to this have been great to oh my god fantastic. I was in Vermont for the weekend and I have Everett, Edward, and Walden. While I though all were good, only Everett was amazing to me. Now, I barely got three growlers of HFS at the brewery because I overlooked the fact that they were cash only. Anyway, I got three smaller growlers and I'll review Susan and Abner when I have then. 
I'm not going to do a full ASTMO review, but this beer was incredible. While a lot of IPAs get that citrus grapefruit-y flavor, #4 gets more of oranges. It's sweeter and tangier. It's got a little more of that creamy IPA goodness you'd get from an IPA that has more of that banana/guava goodness. Overall, Society and Solitude #4 will leave you wanting more because it is so damn good.
I thoroughly enjoyed my trip, but this makes me feel grateful to be home and enjoy such a great beer.
Upon revisiting this beer, it's as good as I remember. It's like orange soda without so much sweetness. It's a brilliant feat in the DIPA game. The aromatics, the taste, the feel, it's just so perfect. Considering the two influences, Double Galaxy and Double Citra, are so good. It should be no surprise. This is my favorite DIPA. 1,295 charactersSheppard, Jul 05, 2014

A - Hazy IPA, strawberry blond. Pillowy head and intricate lacing.
S - Passion fruit, pine oil, grass. With some warmth, lemon drop and a kiss of heather.
T - fragrant fruit, sharp hop snap. Tight oily resin. The citrus and conifer seem at odds.
Warmer the citrus fades and the pines win. Actually quite interesting.
M - Carbonation is perfect, lemon drop recedes to tight spruce, a dance across the palate. No conflict there. A dry finish hides the alcohol nicely. A slight linger on the tart side, asks for another sip.
O - Another fine hop centric brew from Hill Farmstead. The profiling is exceptional. Be ready for a challenge though!.

The beer pours a super hazy, murky, unfiltered apricot color, hues of orange and honey with a thick, white, soapy head, easily 2 fingers high with very nice retention that yields a lovely network of sticky lace. The aroma is nice, dank yet juicy, citrusy and piney, grapefruit, hop resin, mangos, pineapples and some grassy weediness that brings out the floral qualities, very pungent, with light, doughy malt. The flavors line up very well, huge pine that brings out the earthy, grassy character, big juicy citrus and tropical fruit with some more rustic wildflower flavors, much stronger bitterness than the nose suggested with the signature hill farmstead malt character, chewy and very doughy without being too sweet, just supports the hops while also imparting a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice, very juicy while coating very well, lively but creamy and soft at times with a very dry finish that lingers nicely.
Verdict: A very nice Double IPA from Hill Farmstead, per usual. Excellent showcase of hops that are both juicy and dank but at times they fight for attention and the bitterness is a bit high and kind of puts a damper on the brightness and delicate nature of the flavors, more aggressive than I'm used to seeing from Hill Farmstead. 1,327 characterskevanb, Jun 28, 2014

Poured from a fat growler into a plastic cup. (We were camping right after getting it in Greensboro).
Beautiful deep yellow/amber color, light frothy head.
Delicious aromas of citrus fruit and resiny hops. Couldnt wait to taste this.
First sip blown away. Hoppy, citrusy and floral with the right amount of bitterness.
A touch alcohol forward as well which I enjoy in a double IPA.
As another reviewer said, such a clean finish, so impressive.
This is a flat out world class beer. I like it much more than S&S #5. 568 charactersBoldRulerVT, Oct 11, 2013

T: Also high on the awesome scale. Sooo juicy and clean. So happy. After a few beers from this brewery I'm noticing a pattern. Clean and juicy. Dank, fresh, very well blended, very delicate. Fruit, fruit, fruit, floral, pine, and grain. Extremely drinkable, and just the kind of double IPA I like. Not too heavy feeling but big nonetheless.
M: Fluid and smooth. A touch resiny with fine carbonation that is worked in so well that you forget about it. This I'd juice meets beer, and I mean that in a 'it's awesome' kind of way.

Really juicy, authentic, pulpy citrus just like I've experienced from all of the HF beers I've tried thus far, but also kiwi, peach, passion fruit, and melon all over a sticky bed of pine needles. Medium-plus bodied, almost chewy in nature as it begs to be swished around. Drying and bitter, but delightfully smooth and dangerously drinkable. Oh man...they harness the pure flavor and aromas of the hops so well. Fantastic! 688 characterswedge, Oct 07, 2013

This poured a hazy gold color with a foamy, thick off-white head that stays for a long time, leaving lacing down the glass as you go.
The aroma on this thing... wow. After my pour I was sitting back in my chair playing on my phone, a good 3 feet from the glass, and the smell was overpowering. Incredibly mango and citrusy hop and fruit smell. 
The taste is an ever-changing complex arrangement that leaves you wishing the bottle was bottomless. At the forefront is a pleasant mango and fruit that tapers off to a biting grapefruit. The way this changes in your mouth is incredible. 
Medium mouthfeel with perfect carbonation (even after spending a week and a half in the growler). 
I wouldn't change a thing about this beer, except make it available more often. 
A must have. 870 charactersjbdpsu82, Sep 30, 2013

4.84/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A - Served on tap at the Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. The beer arrived in a Hill Farmstead wine glass with a creamy two-finger head and a color that is difficult to describe. It's something of a muted orange with a golden glow. The beer is uniformly cloudy. It almost looks like a mango smoothy. Can't wait to try it.
S - Totally blown away by the smell here. It's all of the citrus elements that one might describe in an IPA, wrapped up with that distinctive fresh smell.
T - Follows the nose dead on, but with a rounded, balancing bitterness that lifts the other flavors up on its shoulders. Truly a wonderful mix of flavors. No alcohol detectable.
M - Can't imagine better. A little fuller than medium bodied, but with carbonation that pushes the flavor everywhere in my mouth. It's pillowy, and not the least bit fizzy.
O - I could have just kept ordering these. Well, until I fell out of my chair. Wonderful beer. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it. 962 charactersAndrew041180, Sep 23, 2013

A- murky ultra HF yellow an excellent off white head of foam. Spider-Man like lacing reaches to the side as the brew completely glows in the glass. The most vibrant look you can ever expect. The body screams DIPA
S- there it is.... Papaya, mango, citrus, pineapple, tropical oasis in a glass! Citra and galaxy accompanied by a prickly pine scent that is combined to create something you can only find from HF. This is what is meant by the terminology tropical bouquet. The scent is viral as it bursts into your nostrils and literally clings there. It's perfect... A utopia of DIPA's if you will
T- a cascade of smooth pineapple and mango glides over the tongue while some fresh waves of grass and mild earthiness dust along. So clean and full of a citric hop bouquet. Waves of prickly pineapples coate, sting, and consume the entire mouth. This is the real deal. Massively clean and constructed to dominate with a shade of bitterness
M- HF creaminess and carbonated flavor blasts the palate. Absolutely wicked.
O- I never thought I could have a beer that topped Double Galaxy. Well... Society and Solitude 4 just tied it! This tropical apocalypse just manifested itself as the best beer I have ever had (tied with DG). Unbelievably clean and full of the best hop profile one can ask for. Shaun Hill is the best brewer in the history of mankind. I'm serious 1,409 characterslovindahops, Sep 21, 2013

Best smelling ipa. Ever. This smells so good. Juicy fruits, straight up. Papaya, mango and pineapple. A complex, well-crafted juice, if you will. Well, not quite...
Tastes a lot like the smell. This is a super complex, fruity, tangy ipa. All the same fruit flavors that come in waves after each sip. There is some bitterness in the flavor, but it serves only to balance, not to overwhelm. I don't mind an overwhelming bitterness, but that isn't what this beer is about. I don't know how it's possible to achieve such a unique and distinct flavor profile in an ipa, but I'm sure it's some brilliant combination of the galaxy, citra, and well water. 
Mouthfeel is again typical of HF IPAs; and by typical I mean perfect. Creamy, rich, medium-full bodied. Insanely drinkable. 
This is my second favorite ipa only next to Ephraim. The flavor profile between is is very different, but all the stand out features remain consistent between each brew. Shaun knows which elements to highlight and which elements to leave alone. Can't wait to try more and more. 1,192 characterslunarbrew, Sep 17, 2013

It pours that typical Hill Farmstead hazy golden colour.. with that typical 2cm white head with awesome retention. Not going to lie, this is like the 5th Hill Farmstead IPA I've ever had, and I'm thinking I've been so spoiled by this one.
Now, no question that this is the best DIPA I've ever smelled. It has so much papaya, mango, orange and tangerine I've ever smelled in a beer. It is just so pleasant, citrusy and smooth that I could sniff this growler forever. Of any IPA/DIPA I've ever had, if you ever made a perfume out of this, this is what I would do. It just smells so sweet, complex and fruity all at once.
Flavour on this one is just so great. I'm just trying to figure out if this hop profile can beat Ephraim's. In the end, its very close but no cigar. But no question, there is just so much citrus and tropical fruit in this one that it unseats Abner. And that's saying a lot. One of the best DIPAs I've ever had. Thank you Doug, for sharing this one!
Mouthfeel is typical Hill Farmstead. So full bodied, creamy and refreshing. I honestly wish all brewers would talk to this guy and incorporate his advice into making their beers this creamy and full bodied. The whole world would be better off for it. Its not dry at all, its bitter but yet so flavourful and drinkable that this beer disappears so soon. 
Okay, so this is great. Its crazy to think about it though, if you're a total DIPA head, Vermont is the one state out of the 50 states in the Union that you would want to live in. This is the one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, and I cannot question the use of Citra and Galaxy hops in this. Wow! 1,755 charactersStevedore, Sep 15, 2013

A- Bright golden cloudy hue with a pillowy soft head, looks incredibly inviting
S- Great, mango, passionfruit, papaya, some bitter grapefruit,
T- Initially soft burst of citrus bitter akin to more of a tangerine/orange rind that turns into waves of passionfruit, mango and then kicks in with a more defined grapefruit like bitterness, amazing how many different flavors you get in this...no alcohol and some light cracker malt keeps the bitterness from being overwhelming
M- perfect, not too dry, still a touch of body to carry all the hop flavor
O- One of my favorite beers, dangerously drinkable, even more so than Heady; may be my favorite HF IPA 687 charactersGonzoHomebrewer, Sep 14, 2013

Appearance: Vibrant, glowing pale orange with an effervescent bone white head. Beautiful.
Nose: A bit subdued, surprisingly, but still excellent. Big juicy citrus: oranges, lemons, grapefruits. Some sharp apple and overripe mango. Tons of fruit. The galaxy adds a nice floral grassiness to everything.
Taste: One of the juiciest double IPAs I've tasted. Rich orange juice, fresh mangoes, lemon zest. There's a good bit of fresh-cut grass and white flowers mixed into the middle and a crisp, light toast backbone. Finishes sticky and lightly sweet. 
Mouthfeel: Just about perfect. Full, sticky, maybe a hint too carbonated but its really hard to complain. 
Overall: This may be my favorite IPA that I've had from Hill Farmstead. The juiciness is intense and the balance of it all is excellent. This is definitely in my top tier of double IPAs. I very much hope to get to drink this again someday. 935 charactersfdig23, Sep 09, 2013

Score: 97
A week only growler poured and served in to a snifter glass and enjoyed on 08/02/12. This is a backlogged review from notes.
Appearance: Pours a slightly dull, unfiltered orange-peach color with two fingers of off-white head that settles to a thin layer atop the glass. Good oily lacing and retention. 4/5
Smell: Fresh tropical citrus and pine. Loads of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, orange rind and grassy hops. Oh boy! 4.75/5
Taste: Aggressively hopped grapefruit, lemon, and pineapple upfront, which slowly washes away as more of the piney/grassy hops comes through towards the finish with only a hint of lingering tropical flavor on back of tongue. Touch of dirtiness/earthiness on the midpalate to balance out sweet citrus favors too. A near perfect balance is struck here between the sweet and bitter elements, with growing degrees of bitter, slightly dank qualities in the finish as it warms up. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied with a low amount of carbonation that lets the bitterness sit heavy on the tongue. Juicy on the tongue. 4/5
Overall: Yet another knockout IPA experiment from the master. This imperial IPA gives Heady Topper a serious run for its money. 
Recommendation: Absolutely seek this one out if/when rebrewed again, unless you hate IPAs.
Pairings: Hawaiian pizza.
Cost: $25 for a 2L growler (including the cost of the container). 1,556 charactersjegross2, Dec 17, 2012

Pours a moderate peach color with a nice white head and some spotty lacing. Nose has heavy citrus and tropical notes. Mango big in the flavor, followed by heavy bitterness. Touch of passion fruit. Really bitter, but still crushable. I would have liked a little less on that for more focus on the flavor blend of Citra and Galaxy. 414 charactersThorpe429, Dec 16, 2012

Appearance is golden honey with 1 1/2 fingers of a bright white head. It looks very inviting. The nose on this comes through with pine, mango, grass and hops. Meanwhile the taste, has grains, biscuit, more mango, hops, very nice. It is a tasty beer to be sure. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, rather bitter.

Pours a fairly hazy peach color with a great fluffy white head with great retention and lacing. 
Lovely nose full of tropical fruit, pineapple, apricot, mango and citrus peels. 
Flavor is fantastic. Amazing light citrus. Fantastically balanced with a slightly fruity sweetness up front and finishing with a lovely citrussy and mildly bitter hop back end. 
Mouthfeel is phenomenal. So light and crisp. So good on this un-godly hot CA summer day. 
Overall, God I wish HF was in CA. I've had this and Abner as far as their ipas and both are just phenomenal! 577 charactersMrVonzipper, Sep 13, 2012

APPEARANCE
Let's face it, IPAs almost always look sexy. This beer is no exception. It's a hazy orange juice color and sits under a rather large slightly off-white head. It had beautiful lacing throughout the (too short) drinking session. This is the kind of beer that would make even the most prude chap get all hot and bothered.
SMELL
This beer filled the room with hoppy goodness when I opened the flip top. Tons of Citra yumminess, which brings tropical fruits like pineapple, grapefruit, and mango. The Galaxy brings passion fruit and more citrus. There is a bit of a grape-like aroma as well. For being 8%, there's no alcohol to be found on the nose. This. Beer. Smells. Great. 
TASTE
This is bonkers. It seriously tastes like a blend of freshly squeezed grapefruit and orange juice. I almost expect a little pulp while drinking this. There is a very good amount of tropical fruit character, like mango, a lot of pineapple, blood orange, etc. It's not as bitter as other IPAs I've had. Usually, when an IPA isn't bitter I get disappointed, but in this beer I don't miss it at all. It actually tastes less bitter than grapefruit juice while leaving all of the wonderful sweet fruit flavor. No alcohol to be found in this fella. The only negative thing I have to say about this beer is that there is the absolute SLIGHTEST dank/grassy flavor, but that's only because I drank my Haterade earlier. Overall, the Citra and Galazy are playing together so wonderfully in this beer you'd think they were soul mates. 
MOUTHFEEL
Slightly under carbonated, which I can probably attribute to the 830+ mile trip that this beer had to undergo in the growler. That being said, this beer still has a wonderful mouthfeel. There's just enough residual sugar to keep this beer from going down exactly like water but is by NO means a struggle to drink. The body is medium-light, which is just about perfect for an IPA. There is a tiny bit of hop resin that lingers after the swallow, and it feels more like a grapefruit pith. Yum!
OVERALL
Hill Farmstead has been gaining a ton of respect lately, and beers like this are the reason for it. This is stupidly delicious and a triumph of brewing. I don't want to sit here and fan the flames of all the Hill Farmstead hype, but in my experience they totally deserve it. For me, the amazing thing about this beer is that it has the one thing that I don't like about Imperial IPAs - it's sweet, not bitter. I generally don't like IPAs unless they are tongue-splitting bitter. But this beer makes a fool out of me, and proves that you don't need an IPA that destroys your taste buds to be amazing. Whatever they are doing at Hill Farmstead they're doing right. 
Cheers. 2,802 charactersMaxSpang, Sep 09, 2012

A: Cloudy pale orange body under a finger of large-bubbled white froth from a vigorous pour. Not much internally-produced head, but for impact bubbles they stick around well. Very light lace. No better than average.
S: Lovely hop dominance. Quite dank and herbal up front, with citrus and tropical fruit following close behind. Just a hint of toasty malt. Excellent, but not quite room-filling.
T: Spicy, piquant hoppiness right away, with mango, grapefruit, and spruce resin dominant on the middle part. Huge herbal bitterness pounds the back of my tongue throughout the slightly malty finish and persists to the end of the citrusy, almost eternal aftertaste. Super flavorful, but a little shy of truly dynamic.
M: Medium body, light carbonation. Very soft and delicate, but a touch too close to lifeless.
O: Excellent beer, but I enjoyed both Double Citra and Double Galaxy significantly more. Thanks again, Patrick!

I'm fearful for the day when a google search of "Society & Solitude" brings up Hill Farmstead beers instead of Emerson, but according to Greg Currie, literature can't give us insight into the mind and its workings anyways, so I drink Hill Farmstead when I could be reading Emerson. 
Pours a cloudy tangerine yellow-orange. A finger of resilient, creamy white head sticks around. 
Riper-than-ripe juicyfruit nose. Unbelievable tropical fruit, mango, tangerine, lemon citrus, pineapple, maybe a hint of green leafy bitterness. Bright, bitter, and brilliant.
More of the same. A citra bomb on the front of the palate, beaming citrus and pineapple, playing right into galaxy's passionfruit/tropical fruit brilliance. Mango juice. This beer sweats more juicy, fruity bitterness than other beers are made of. Resinous finish. Just enough sweetness to pull this back from the too-bitter. 
Creamy; medium, medium light bodied. 
At this point I'm convinced Shaun knows something other brewers don't. One of my personal favorites from his repertoire of IPAs/DIPAs, and playing right into my weaknesses, S&S #4 is a nearly perfect showcase of what citra and galaxy can do. 1,209 charactersVerecund, Sep 06, 2012

Served with a .5 finger white head which dissipated quickly. Spotty lace with good stick. Beer is cloudy honey. Clarity hurts, but solid on all other fronts.
Nose is honey, citrus, sap hop bitterness, papaya, peach, and other tropical fruit. Moderately aromatic. Very good.
Opens citrus sweetness. Papaya, tree sap hoppiness packs a bitter punch that's balanced out by a tropical fruit malt body that emerges towards the middle. Citrus comes out even more towards the end. Finishes with a hop creaminess that fades into a bitter aftertaste. Perfect.
Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Abrasive and lively in the mouth and smooth going down. Messy finish with a lingering aftertaste. Complements the flavor profile amazingly.
Another outstanding hoppy offering from Hill Farmstead. Solid if not near perfect on all fronts. 927 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 03, 2012

Appearance: Cloudy straw yellow in color. Pours a nice full, three finger head. Leaves a really nice lacing up and down the glass.
Aroma: Huge citrus aromas upfront. Lots of tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, and some resiny pine. A really pleasant and aromatic hop profile.
Taste: Cirtus and tropical fruit notes really shine here as well. The bitterness is not overpowering at all. Tons of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. Some pine comes in near the end, but any of the bitterness is offset by some of the sweetness of the alcohol and malt, which adds a touch of light honey. Really balanced and tasty. Completely drinkable. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and very crisp. Really refreshing and easy to drink.
Overall, another spectacular Hill Farmstead IPA. Definitely one of my new favorites and one I would like to have them revisit soon. Really tropical, balanced and refreshing. Considering the ABV, this is really easy to drink a lot of. A definite winner. 1,108 charactersGosox8787, Aug 29, 2012

Mildly hazy orange yellow with a dense white head that falls off to a disk. The nose? JFC. Big fruit - citrus, stone fruit, bright, redolent and resplendently hoppy. Not grassy at all. Beautiful aromatic. The citrus is more orange and tangerine than grapefruit. Fantastic stuff.
The palate opens with a great balance between bitterness and fruitiness, with the brightness of Citra front and center, while the tropical notes from Galaxy play a secondary but crucial role. Delicate but firm, there's pineapple and mango coupled with a very enjoyable citrus note. Malt character is mild, a little doughy, even. That said, this is all hops. Drying, mildly fruity and a touch resiny on the finish, this has great balance between the fruity flavors and bitterness. Medium light in body, moderately carbonated, this is fantastic stuff. 913 charactersDefenCorps, Aug 27, 2012

A slight dull lemony yellow body, but some nice faint green hues here also ever so slight. Opaque. Easily one to two finger rich creamy white and merringue head, thick clumps of lacing, big retention, lots of staying power. Wonderful looking brew.
What a great nose on this. Citrus and tropical hob bomb, without the mushy sweetness. Smells like fresh tropical fruit from the island. Mango, faint peach, incredibly fleshy, with warm earthy hop tones, and even a grain fresh ripping malt sense. Unreal.
Taste brings pure magic. Juicy palate and wonderful tropical fruit punch body, with a good thickness. Hop juice finish, mild resin, with big hints of mango and soft baguette dough french bread on the aftertaste. Full, rich, luscious.
Overall just and amazing creation, flooring. Just a stunning brew. Reminds me of a superior Odell Myrcenary. 956 characterssmakawhat, Aug 23, 2012
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I made the pilgrimage to the Hill Farmstead Brewery in early August and picked up a 2 liter growler of this particularly fruity Imperial IPA brewed with Citra and Galaxy hops. Why 2 liters? Let's just say I couldn't resist. Beer was poured from the growler into my St. Bernardus chalice. Review is from notes. 
Appearance (5/5): A medium strength pour from the growler produces a luxuriant 2 finger, white head of foam that sits atop a body of opaque, peach orange colored beer. A significant amount of sticky lacing lines the sides of the glass. This is one of the most picturesque IPAs I have seen: it has the signature HF peach orange hue and opaqueness due to its being unfiltered and demonstrates ample head and lacing. Everything you want to see in a beer, nothing less. 
Smell (5/5): Notes of pineapple, tropical fruit, some pine. There is a distinct earthiness to the S & S #4's aroma that I really like. There are faint hints of malt that push back, albeit gently and, ultimately, ineffectually against the tidal wave of fruity hop aromas. 
Taste (5/5): The first thing anyone notices about this IPA is the absurd level of fruitiness going on: mango, pineapple, orange, passion fruit, grapefruit, and cantaloupe. A little piney flavor is worked in there as well. The bitterness is medium-ish, to put it technically; hop astringence is less prevalent than hop sweetness and fruitiness. S & S's bitterness grows as you consume and the hop oils saturate the tongue, however. A nice biscuity malt provides a nice bit of token resistance. Minimal alcohol presence in the back does not distract at all from the wonderful hop flavor experience. Legit perfection here. 
Mouthfeel (5/5): Society and Solitude #4 has a medium body and good medium-light carbonation. This is a very smooth beer. Unlike many IPA's, this one doesn't have much prickliness to it. It is highly drinkable and never feels thick or cloying because of body, poor carbonation problems, or resinous-ness. 
Overall (5/5): Hill Farmstead Society and Solitude #4 is, simply put, incredible beer and is one of my favorite Imperial IPAs. It is a beautiful, exceptionally fruity, mildly bitter, and immensely drinkable beer that begs to be had fresh. Whenever you see it on tap or at the brewery in Greensboro Bend, VT, make sure to snag some. I hope all you hop-lovers enjoy it as much as I did. 2,366 charactershagbergl, Aug 23, 2012

Thanks for sharing this with me, corregidore!
Hazy yellow and light golden with a moderately sized near-white head eventually leaving lines and spiderwebs of lace down the glass. Pretty.
There's a huge assortment of citrus/fruity hop elements in this: grapefruit, mango, nectarine, and orange; sensing a theme? There's enough bread/biscuit to backbone this nicely.
The flavor is similar to the aroma as the citrus and bright fruit/hop notes stand out, though balanced nicely enough by biscuit and mild caramel. Moderate bitterness; remarkably drinkable.
Medium bodied with high carbonation.
My favorite on a night that included many fine beers. 658 charactersehammond1, Aug 19, 2012

Huge thanks for the generosity. Much appreciated. 
A: Hazy pale yellow with an inch of soapy white froth that lingers for a minute before settling to a thin layer of sea foam. Sheets of lacing coat the glass. Pretty hazy.
S: I'm immediately struck by pineapple, followed by nectarine, pine, papaya, and a floral-like spiciness with a dash of lemon. There's a light cracker and biscuit malt presence that's dominated by the grim and unyielding hop aromatics.
T: A juicy blend of nectarine, orange, stone fruit, and grapefruit rind with a light spiciness. There's a light crackery malt presence that's overwhelmed by a smooth upper moderate bitterness and a plethora of hop flavor. The finish is pleasantly clean and crisp without a hint of alcohol.
M: Lower medium body with upper medium carbonation. Dry and sticky mouthfeel.
Overall: Another excellent Double IPA from Hill Farmstead. Thanks again. 914 charactersHopHead84, Aug 18, 2012

S - Big aromatic nose that wreaks of big ripe juicy mango, pineapple, sweet grapefruit, all resinous and drowns out the malt base. There's also an alcohol effervescence that's noticeable.
T - Matches up with the nose: Lots of resin and tropical fruit oils with a pepper spice - sweet ruby grapefruit bitterness, mango, bitter oranges, and is hop forward but as the glass warms up the light malt comes through a little more to help balance things out.

A - Pours hazy golden orange with a dense two finger tall white head leaving sticky rings of lace down the entire glass.
S - Smells of fresh citric fruit zest, pungent hops, fresh cut grass, pine needles and some light caramel malt sweetness.
T - Starts off with a ton of hop bitterness that lasts through the finish. The galaxy and citra hops work well together but they are hard to tell them apart at times. Hints of citric fruit zest, grass and pine as well as some sweet caramel help round things out. The finish is quite bitter, lingering on the palate long after the finish.
M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Lots of bitterness throughout with a dry finish, no alcohol detectable at all.
O - A very good DIPA yet again from Hill Farmstead. Not as good as some of their other hoppy beers but it was still a very enjoyable, easy drinking beer. 934 charactersorangesol, Aug 14, 2012

Pours murky apricot orange with thick white foam that sticks around for quite some time. The nose really opens as it warms - peach, mango, dank, some pineapple and resin. Nice nose - not too sweet, which is norm as of late. Flavor is bitter and grainy with plenty of nuances. Pine, grapefruit rinds, some lemon and grains. I'm surprised and refreshed at how bitter this is. Medium bodied and moderated carb. Nice beer, I'm betting this is a step higher up at the brewery fresh as possible. I think the peach and mango would be stronger and really make this one. 575 charactersharrymel, Aug 14, 2012

Appearance - Very hazy orange. Small white head. Light, but almost contiguous layer of foam remains atop the beer. Surprisingly leggy as I swirl it.
Smell - A two-faced smell. First aroma is a gigantic pineapple and mango flavor. Almost like there's mango juice in it. Sweet smelling. Behind it is a distinct grapefruit pungency. Almost as if there are two glasses of beer in front of me and I'm smelling both at the same time.
Taste - The flavor lacks a bit of the depth the aroma has. The flavors blend better, but they are also a touch diminished. The grapefruit is more dominant than the tropical fruits and the grapefruit becomes much more dominant in the finish. Builds to a strong bitter grapefruit finish.
Mouthfeel - Low-ish carbonation. Probably due to the growler. Medium body. The bitterness is extreme, though, much like Society & Solitude #3. Like chewing on a grapefruit in the end.
Overall - Everything is great except the finish. Still an extremely enjoyable IPA. Maybe not something I could drink 5 of like Heady, but still excellent. Please continue these hop experiments, Mr. Hill, but cut back on those bittering hops, please! 1,205 charactersAlieniloquium, Aug 11, 2012

Citrus notes dominate the palate with a nice array of grapefruit and orange. Bitterness is there to give a little kick but does not abuse your tastebuds like many DIPAs do. Finding this to be rather sweet with just enough malt backbone to help round things out. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice lively carbonation. Overall, S&S #4 truly is a top notch DIPA that really shows how some of these newer hops like citra can be used. 633 charactersKinsman, Aug 10, 2012
3.63/5  rDev -20.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Growler into a snifter. Thanks go to Jonathan for picking up several growlers at the brewery and bringing them to my house to share. The brew pours a clouded golden yellow. A finger of off-white head fades leaving thick patches of lace sticking to the glass. A light swirl effortlessly brings a finger back to the surface.
The aroma of this brew has quite a bit of straw to dry grain or wheat quality. Citrus is there with some grass and cheese quality. When swirled it gets almost footy with a smell of floor malted pilsner and gets even more like funky feta. Faint tropical notes are there intermingled with some alcohol esters. The smell is somewhat like grapefruit but instead of the flesh, it concentrates more on the pulp or rindy elements. A cut above the other HF hoppy brews I got to try lately.
The taste brings the bitterness with an oily resinous cling. Just like the aroma led on, there is a very strong grassy and straw to wheat element. Some sulfur and cheese flavoring mid palate. The alcohol is fairly evident with a solvent kick that warms the back of the throat. At times this brew feels quite tannic and almost astringent. The bitterness is quite pulpy like grapefruit rinds and it persists long after each sip with an herbal to grassy feel to it. Some sips mildly hint towards some residual sweetness but that is short lived as the bitterness is quick to swallow that up.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest snappy level of carbonation. For 8% it is astoundingly crisp and easy drinking. I just dont know what the deal is with these Hill Farmstead offerings. It is like every single one of them utilizes a strikingly similar grain bill with the same bittering/flavor hop additions. Other than the alcohol/body fluctuating and a minor twist and turn in the aroma, I am hard pressed to find distinguishing qualities among many of these. I hate to be ignorant or rude here but I almost feel like if you had one of their hoppy offerings, you had them all. 1,982 charactersstakem, Aug 10, 2012

I didn’t notice any major differences. Appearance: Deep opaque orange with thick white head. Aroma: Tropical fruits (orange, pinneaples) at first, then there is a rustic touch, wood, dank and grass. Taste: Very bitter, some spicy hops, a nice citrus tartness cuts through the bitterness and accentuates drinkability. Full bodied and very dry. Nice mix between rustic and fruity, quite complex. An average Hill Farmstead double IPA, which means a world class DIPA. 576 charactersLuk13, Aug 06, 2012
4.05/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Sean for sharing this growler. Served in a Hopleaf tulip.
A - White foam settles to a thin cap and splotchy lace. Hazy golden body.
S - Big Galaxy hop aroma, with some zesty citrus in there as well. Lots of tropical fruits and bit of dankness, but this is a true double IPA with a good amount of sweet malts as well.
T - The flavor is also heavy on palate-numbing Galaxy hops and bruising bitterness. Again, lots of tropical fruits, citrus zest, as well as some sugary malts and toasted grains. Gets quite bitter after a few ounces.
M - Medium-full body, moderate carbonation, super dry finish, and well-hidden alcohol.
D - While this seems like a great idea on paper (Double Galaxy + Double Citra + ? = Profit), it's a little too bitter to enjoy in large quantities. I'm with Thorpe429 on this one - merely good, and probably my least favorite beer in the series. 879 charactersMasterSki, Aug 06, 2012

Growler to HF Stem
750ml
Thanks to RudZud & Jlindros for sending this.
App- As soon as the cap was popped on the growler I was excited. Pours out a deep orange with a bit of a unfiltered haze to it. The head was pure white with a great amount of cling to it.
Smell- Awesomely hoppy but not over done. Not boozy. Rich notes of creme come up with deep notes of tropical fruits. Guava, mango, pineapple. So lush you just smell for a while. I get only small amounts of pine coming up as well.
Taste- OMG, like Guy Fieri says, "Welcome to flavor town" This is a great example of a well made DIPA with huge hops, great citrus and incredible balance. Not overtly piney or boozy on the flavor. Great layers of creamy hops and dank citrus.
Mouth- Incredible smooth and lush with a low medium body and a paired well bubbly medium carbonation. The creamy notes just stay with you and at the same time entice you into drinking this way too quickly.
Drink- I think I finally have something to suggest to people other than HT. This is like HT's little brother that is slowly going through a growth spurt ready to kick big bros ass. 1,143 charactersFosterJM, Aug 04, 2012

Pours a hazy golden orange with a finger of bright white bubnly head
Big citrus and pine notes on the nose. The smell is extremely enticing.
The taste is an explosion of orange citrus and pungent pine hops. An amazing tasting brew for sure. I wish I could have had this straight from the tap.
Medium bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation. Very easy drinking if you can handle hop bombs. Drying citrusy pine aftertaste.
Overall, this is a top notch IPA. Can't thank jlindros enough for the trade. The perfect brew for IPA day without a doubt. 600 charactersdcloeren, Aug 03, 2012

Beer pours a hazy orange color, nothing visible through it, with a finger of soft frothy off white head. Head dissipates after a few minutes, leaving heavy lacing on the edge of the glass, to a collar of frothy bubbles. Really nice lacing.
Nose orange fruit and peel, mango, pineapple, pine, dank herbal and grassy hops, and light caramel sweetness. 
Taking a sip, citrus peel bitterness, orange and grapefruit, and sweeter hops, orange, mango and pineapple. Mid tongue, more dank pine and herbal flavors dominate with continuing light sweet hops and a bit of caramel malt to help balance the bitterness. Finishes dry with lingering citrus and dank herbal and pine flavors. 
Light to medium body, with plenty of carbonation despite the growler fill, light and zesty bubbles. My first HF DIPA and it's very very good. 908 charactersnataku00, Jul 29, 2012

Pretty standard HF IPA appearance: cloudy, milky pale amber body with two fingers of lasting head. The nose is a cornucopia of tropical fruit, with papaya, mango, pineapple and a touch of stone fruit. Really impressive hop aroma that nearly overwhelms the malt backbone. The palate offers more of the same, great pineapple, stone fruit and mango flavors that lead into a clean but assertive bitterness. There's a touch of crackery malt beneath. Really impressive stuff. 478 characterslargadeer, Jul 29, 2012

Look: Pours a yellowish orange color with a 1/2 inch white head good retention and some nice circular lace
Smell: Tropical fruit galore here pineapple mango come to mind due to the Citra hops. 
Taste: Again there is some tropical fruits mangos, peach and pineapple are all present. But I must say that I was not a fan of the way the Citra and Galaxy hops blended together it created a weird flavor that I can't really explain
Mouthfeel: Medium body and good amount of carbonation and slightly dry
Overall: I wanted to really like this beer because I absolutely love citra hops but in the end it just ended up being a solid DIPA and nothing overly special 694 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jul 28, 2012
4.7/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml growler purchased from the brewery 6 days ago. Poured in to HF stemmed tulip glass.
A - Completely cloudy medium yellow with some orange in the middle of the glass. A thin layer of white head formed and reduced to a ring around the glass. Some spotty lacing. 
S - Massive grapefruit aroma up front with some peach, mango and a touch of pine. A mild malt sweetness is present as well. Very juicy and fresh nose. 
T - A sharp bitterness up front that is assertive without being palate-wrecking. Grapefruit, peach and passion fruit flavours are dominant with some lighter mango notes. A fairly sweet malt backbone provides a good balance, more so than the nose indicated. As I continue to drink this one, the galaxy hops come to the forefront more so than the citra. 
M - Medium body with a really big chew. The amazing and typical HF dryness is present. Full of tongue-coating hop oils. 
O - Another great effort from HF. 931 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Jul 28, 2012

Super special thanks to TheSevenDuffs for this one. Your generosity never ceases to amaze...
A- Hazy sunset hued pour with a two finger, large white bubbled head. Slowly fades to a thin cap leaving gobs of lacing around the sides of the glass.
S- Huge amounts of grapefruit, it's as if it has grapefruit juice in it. That sour, citrusy pulpy flesh thrown right in. Bitter pine and than it sweetens out with pineapple, mango and a touch of mandarin and strawberries. This truly is a remarkable smelling beer. Super citrus forward just the way I like it and the way it should be!
T- Grapefruit, mango, mandarin oranges, mango and pineapple. Very tropical but still bitter enough with the citrus and pine hop profile to make any hop head savour every sip. Lingering grapefruit finish.
M- Heavier side of light bodied, good carbonation.
O- I think I found the perfect (if not top 2) IPAs ever produced. It's literally perfect in every sense, the grapefruit is what does it for me. I used to hate grapefruit years ago but now I can't get enough, and having it jammed in a bottle of beer from a highly regarded brewery makes it even better! 1,181 characterskorguy123, Jul 27, 2012

Served out of a growler (sorry Shaun...not really) into a Hill Farmstead tulip. Don't believe me? Check my twitter. This beer was really good. It was a little sweeter than I expected but a great mouthfeel and a nice finish. 
Beer is orangish yellow and mildly hazy with a soft white head, small and large bubbles and some lacing nice retention steady carbonation. 
Aroma is light, mildly malty, tropical fruits and sweetness. Nice hops. Very good aroma. 
Beer is medium in body and creamy, mildly sweet with a nice finish. Mildly bitter in contrast to the hop profile of tropical fruit and papaya. Mango and other pineapple. I love the beer and has a great finish. 785 charactersdrabmuh, Jul 27, 2012

A - cloudy copper orange
S - Awesome. A lot of tropical fruits but mango really stands out, some pine notes. 
T - Tropical fruit, passion fruit and mango stand out amongst the impressive salvo of fruit flavors, some pine. There is an impressive amount of hop flavour without being over powering and annihilating your palate for anything else you might eat/drink 
M - This is the one of the most impressive things about the beer, very dry mouth feel. Lowish carbonation. 
O - An amazing beer. Full of delicious hops, fantastic mouth feel. This is one of the best beers I have ever had the good fortune of having. 666 charactersWeebay, Jul 26, 2012

A. Large foamy white head with really nice lacing. Body is a hazy orange with some carbonation bubbling up. Looks pretty nice.
S. Big time sweet fruits. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango and orange and a subtle earthy green bitterness. 
T. Obviously very hoppy. Sweet citrus melds nicely with the bitterness from front to back. Sweet pink grapefruit gets me initially along with an array of nice tropical fruits. Next comes a quick jab of bitterness that packs a punch. The finish is a nice balance of hops and sweet fruit that leads to a lingering citrus and pine taste. Awesome IPA. 
M. Mediumish mouthfeel which is nice. Many of the big DIPAs ive had lately have been big thick and syrupy, this feels nice. Carbonation is smaller bubbles and a low to medium low amount. Feel is pretty much spot on.
O. This is a fantastic IPA, the flavor really takes the cake with this beer. Perfectly balanced between bold sweetness and bitterness. Everything else was spectacular as well. Another top notch brew from Hill Farmstead. 1,086 charactersGushue3, Jul 26, 2012

A - Pours a a mirky golden orange color, white frothy head, sticky lace, thick collar, and some wisps on top.
S - Big mango & tropical fruit sweetness up front on the nose along with some citrus and pine that quickly follow. The hops are there, big time, but the fruit & citrus help balance things out very nicely...not overpowering (which I prefer).
T - Grassy, tropical fruit sweetness, some earth, pine. A little more dank then the nose and the hops are showcased here a bit more. There still a nice orange citrus peel note here as well. Alcohol is there, ever so slightly for 8%. Finish is super-bitter pine & resin.
M - Medium body, good carbonation, oily bitter finish.
O - A really nice DIPA that makes two special beers combine into one. I have to say, I'm a fan of the Galaxy DIPA over this beer, but prefer this one over Double Citra. That said, it's all meaningless chatter because this beer is very enjoyable and I will be drinking more in the very near future. Cheers! 1,023 charactersSean9689, Jul 25, 2012

a - Pours a hazy golden yellow color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks pretty good.
s - Smells of citrus hops, pine hops, grapefruit, oranges, floral hops, and some fruity malts. Just a ton of wonderful fresh citrus and pine hops. The nose is just about perfect and what you'd want in a big hoppy DIPA.
t - Tastes of citrus hops, lemon, grapefruit, oranges, pine hops, and floral hops. There is more orange and lemon than the nose and less pine hops, with some moderate bitterness, but not a ton. Amazing taste again, though the nose is a tiny bit better.
m - Light to medium body and moderate carbonation evident. Body has some moderate bitterness.
o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic DIPA, and it is probably my favorite Hill Farmstead beer, which is saying a lot as I love this brewery. The nose is perfect and the taste is great, both with a ton of citrus and pine hops. Easy to drink two glasses of, would love to get it again. 1,116 charactersmdfb79, Jul 24, 2012
4.59/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Made a special trip to the Pony Bar on the Upper East Side so I wouldn’t miss the very brief NYC appearance of this beer. Other kegs seemed to kick in a single afternoon and this one wound up lasting less than a day so it seems I wasn’t alone. Simply put this is as good as any highly hopped beer I’ve ever had. I don’t know how to rank these beers anymore; it simply is a matter of what hop combination one prefers at any given time, because this one and things like Abner, Pliny, Double Sunshine, the best of Alpine, Heady, the best of Surly and Three Floyds, etc. are all just fantastic. Holy crap there are some terrific hoppy beers being brewed these days.
S & S #4 pours light hazed, apricot/gold; with a small, slowly settling head and nicely clinging lace. Super vivid hoppy aroma leaps from the glass, packing tons of tropical fruit, citrus, pine, and resinous notes. The flavor follows suit; there’s no maltiness muddling things up; just lots of tropical and citrus fruit, with lesser pine and floral notes bringing up the rear. Some very light fruity sweetness and a dry finish. Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. The bitterness is assertive but doesn’t get in the way of the hop subtleties at all. Booze is totally masked. 
Medium body, moderate carbonation; smooth and slightly creamy, drinks clean but leaves the hops lingering on your tongue for a long time. Bravo, extremely well done. What a beer. 1,433 characterstobelerone, Jul 24, 2012

A - Familiar HF hazy, golden, orangeish-yellow, straw color with three finger head with great lacing and retention. Beautiful.
S - Sweet, hoppy, fruit juice with some mellow tropical mango, pineapple balanced with sharp grapefruit citrus. pretty amazing. Hint of malt, but that's it. 
T - Wow! wonderful flavor profile. You get fresh, juicy hop notes from orange & grapefruit to pineapple, mango and even banana! I've never tasted a banana like note -- delicious! Really nice balance of bitterness and sweetness throughout with a lingering finish. There is a slight pale malt presence, but easily outshined by the glorious hop juice! 
M - Incredibly drinkable, especially with a medium to full body. Very robust, bursting with flavor. Great carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. As each sip lingered on the palate, it left great anticipation for the next. 
O - Delicious and most enjoyable. Having sampled many of HF's DIPAs, I have perhaps even unrealistic expectations when I taste a new one. This beer delivered. It's high on the top favorites list for me. I enjoyed #4 more than either Double Citra or Double Galaxy on their own. A world class beer. So drinkable, fresh and refreshing, you could enjoy outside on a summer day, lazily passing conversation, pour after pour. Yet so equally delicious and interesting, you could savor each sip as if it were the last. I feel this is where Mr. Hill solves the Double IPA equation. Achieving the perfect combination of wonderfully interesting, unique and delicate flavor profiles that are equally as approachable, inviting, and drinkable. Well done. 1,648 charactersdurrrr, Jul 22, 2012

S-Such a concentrated grapefruit aroma. Literally wreaks of ruby red grapefruit. Coarse and ridden with deep tropical fruits. Pine is also stressed. I wouldn't call the nose 'bright'. It's more of an intensely concentrated aroma. Either way, the nose is world class. Wreaks of hoppy fruits.
T-Brilliant flavor! Ruby, ruby, ruby, ruby red GRAPEFRUIT. Citrus and tropic fruits. All of the fruitiness is covered in a shell of rigid pine hops. Malt is built into the flavor but I stands no chance against the ridiculous hoppiness of the beer.
M-Medium-to-heavy body. Has that 'Hill Farmstead' carbonation level. Feel drawn from a cask. Resinous. Feels Iike a muscular DIPA.

Looks like a HF DIPA - a hazy golden-orange with a thin white head. All DIPAs should look like this one. Smell is awesomely fruity - you can barely even tell it's hops that you're smelling here and not a fresh fruit juice with a slight hint of spice. I've never had one quite like this before. The flavor here is also quite interesting - not exactly what I was expecting, but super impressive. Obviously it's hoppy, but the flavor is nicely complex - there is a quite noticeably an orange peel thing going on where you get both the sweetness and the bitterness at the same time. It's more on the bitter side than most of the HF DIPAs. Mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, another big hit of a hoppy beer from Hill Farmstead. This one is certainly a little unique and stands on its own.
Edit: Opening up a 2nd growler, this beer is not nearly as bitter and is significantly more drinkable than the first growler was. It's a hell of a beer! Bumping flavor from 4.5 to 5. 1,136 charactersstarrdogg, Jul 20, 2012

A: Poured a deep golden color with an apricot-orange tinted hue with about a finger and a half of white head. The head receded into suds and a thick rim around the walls of the glass. 
S: The aroma on the beer reveals hints of orange, grapefruit, and tangerines. The beer holds a very "clean" smell. One of the better smelling DIPAs I have head (reminds me of Abner). 
T: This is what an IPA should taste like; bright sweet citrus quality engulfs my palate (notes of sweet orange and sugar sprinkled grapefruit) upfront. Out the back is mild sweetness that is over taking by a lingering bitterness. 
M: Light/Soft carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. 
O: A very well crafted IPA. The aroma is an excellent foreword to the taste. The taste is extremely balanced and full of flavor. On par, if not better than Abner (and I loved Abner). 1,017 charactersxenjoiii, Jul 16, 2012
4.33/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at DeCicco's Brewster. Appearance is a hazy medium golden yellow with a puffy white head. Smell is not as strong as some other DIPAs at first but seems to be stronger after a taste, which is smooth and mellow without any alcohol aftertaste. Overall, another solid brew from Hill Farmstead. My only complaint is that I could not get a growler as they are not permitted to sell anything but in-store servings by the glass. Bummer. I see a road trip in the future to get growlers of HF beer at the brewery. 510 charactersotispdriftwood, Jul 16, 2012

4.62/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml HFB swing-top bottle filled at the brewery. 
First HFB glass pours with a 1/2" off-white head, over the cloudy golden amber brew. Head promptly fades and drifts to the rim, with slow-falling lace. Aroma is tangerines and sweetness. 
Taste begins sweet, tart citrus in the middle, closes with pine bitterness that lingers. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is excellent for the style. Nice brew from start to finish. 436 charactersppoitras, Jul 15, 2012

4.38/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5First tried a sample of this at Drink Craft Beer's Summerfest last night in Sommerville. This review is from a 750ml growler filled at the bottle release earlier today. Poured into Hill Farmstead glass.
A- Pours a hazy opaque yellowish orange with a finger of nice fluffy white head that slowly recedes. About average carbonation. Leaves nice layered lacing.
S- A nice aroma of citrus hops and tropical fruits of lemons, oranges, grapefruit, papaya balanced with some subtle spices and some faint booze in the background. Definitely above average aroma strength, hit with the smell while pouring from the growler.
T- Oranges, a little bit of lemons, grapefruit, some light spices. Finishes with a semi-sweet citrusy fruit flavor that lingers for awhile. Definitely not that bitter.
M- Medium bodied, very well balanced, high drinkability, goes down very smoothly, average carbonation, has a very nice full-bodied well-balanced feel for a DIPA.
O- This was another awesome beer from Hill Farmstead, right up there with the rest of them. Very nice balance between citrus fruits and spices and having a very high drinkability without being overly bitter or citrusy. Drinks much lighter then a 8% abv beer. Unfortunately Double Citra kicked before I got the chance to try it, would have loved to compare the two. Wish I could get weekly growler fills of this! 1,360 charactersjaasen64, Jul 15, 2012
4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On draft at Blackback pub in Waterbury. I also drank a 750 mL of this last week.
The beer appears hazy and golden hued with a half inch of white head. The aroma offers a delectable bouquet of citrus and hops. Malt presence seems minimal - seems very promising so far. OK I'm back...just went to a different universe when I tasted this. To say this is delicious and smooth doesn't begin to do this beer justice. Light bodied without being thin. Dangerously drinkable. Will report back after I come back down from this... 520 charactersHuhzubendah, Jul 15, 2012

4.45/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On draft last night at Brouwerij Lane.
Beautiful golden pour with tons of white head. Plenty of lace adorns my glass. Strong aroma of fresh hops, grapefruit, mangos, citrus, sweet malt, and more piney hops. Love it!
Strongly hopped, yet the ominous malt backbone provides balance. Fruity and delicious up front with piney hops playing rhythm guitar. Perfectly carbonated, and honestly just sublime.
HF comes through again with another world-class DIPA! 455 charactersbrystmar, Jul 14, 2012
4.05/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured a hazy orange with a small head. 
Smells of light citrus and tropical fruits. 
Taste is slightly bitter with a tropical fruit sweetness. 
Feels really rich in the mouth without being cloying or too heavy. Finishes with a slight dryness.
Another awesome HF offering. 276 charactersDaveHack, Jul 13, 2012

Pours a hazy orange/yellow color with a small white head and some nice thin lacing. Nose is fruity, citrus, and a bit piney.
Taste is bitter, but well balanced, very chewy and creamy with a nice full hop character- fruity and rich on the start and bitter and sweet on the finish. Excellent. 419 characterskingcrowing, Jul 11, 2012

Pours a very nice head from a growler, big fluffy 1.5 finger head that fades pretty slowly and leaves bits of lacing, over very hazy peach-orange colored beer with a light rosy hue.
Nose brings plenty of hops, fresh fruity citrus hops, with a tropical fruit bringing a bit of grapefruit, light musty almost resin but not quite resinous, a hint of clementine and tangerine, and even touch of pineapple. Just a touch of a light amber pale malt underneath it all. 
Taste starts with a hint of sweetness and some amber malts with a touch of a reddish malt flavor. Then hops, it doesn't get too bitter but a nice hop full flavor. Hops bring mostly citrus and tropical fruits, with a nice grapefruit flavor, hints of citrus tangerine and clementine like flavors again, touch of a pineapple and even slight spicy hops. Mostly clean and a light musty fresh hops. Juicy light tropical fruit juice. Finish is drier with a fairly bigger hop bite, hint of spiciness of hops and some light citrus and tropical fruits. Just a hint of what could be seen as booze but barely.
Mouth is med to slightly bigger bodied, fluffy, with decent carb.
Overall quitegood, nice hop character without a big bitterness, quite drinkable, booze hidden fairly well, just a light malt to attempt to balance it, and lots of tropical fruit juice flavors. 1,417 charactersjlindros, Jul 08, 2012
