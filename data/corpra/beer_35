4.59/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a 16oz can, dated 06/20/17... let it grow. Served in a tulip.
Pours a full-on murky, dull yellow grapefruit juice colour with two fingers of super-soft, ivory-coloured suds. Slowly settles to a thick, foamy cap and a thick curtain of bubbly, webby lacing.
Smells weedy, oily, herbaceous and dank. 
Tastes like bhang water and lemonade, all greasy and sexy. Herbal tea, pine needles, grapefruit peels and spunked-on blue jeans. Resinous, earthy, oily and dank with a long, lingering, dry, piney and pithy bitterness.
Feel is smooth and creamy, medium-hefty bodied, very well carbonated and drying.
I'm not sure why I haven't rated this before, I've had it several times, but I don't remember it being this utterly masterful in the past. Maybe the least Tree House-like of all the regular line up so hard to say 'better than this' or 'not as good as that' but, sweet merciful Dionysus, it left me with hop oils leaking out the corners of my eyes and a slight erection. 976 characterspapposilenus, Jun 22, 2017

A:  poured into a tulip to a deep yellowish orange that is hazy as all hell and topped by a dense two finger white head that has good retention and lacing
S:  Smells of oily and juicy citrus hop notes with a little tropical fruit and pineapple.
T:  Taste is juicy hops with citrus, some herbal notes and tropical fruit with some hints of pineapple.  Slight malt sweetness but mostly just fresh and juicy hops.  Swallow is more juicy citrus and tropical fruits with some slight lingering herbal bitterness balanced by slight malty sweetness
M:  This beer has a moderate mouthfeel with a creamy texture. Decent carbonation is just under prickly.  The swallow on the beer is oily and resinous so it coats the mouth well.
O:  Overall this is a tasty beer.  Definitely different from what I am used to with some very nice and bright hop notes.  It seems to represent the style well but I think there are some better IPAs out there.  Tree House has a lot of hype behind them but hype is not a flavor note. 1,017 charactersSHODriver, Jun 17, 2017

4.44/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was one of those beers that I've been lucky enough to sample multiple times in the line at Other Half. Many probably consider this to be the standard for IPA's from this neck of the woods, and it's quite easy to see how! Tasty, smooth, and easy to drink, it's nearly impossible not to like this once the initial hit of the hops and citrus takes hold.
Such a fabulous pour and look to this beer as the beer had an extremely opaque and dank pineapple hue to it with a bit of sediment floating around the bottom. The date was partially hidden on the bottom of the can but this was from this year and smelled and tasted fresh as ever. Loads of citrus, melon, stone fruit, and Mosaic hops in the nose with all of those present in the taste as well. Smooth, juicy, and dank in the aftertaste, this beer slid right now and hid the alcohol well at the same time. Orange cream and stone fruit sweetness kicked in later with *tons* of rings of lacing left on nearly all of my pint glass as I worked my way through this. Has any beer I've ever had looked and tasted this impressive, in equal amounts? 
Even with a bit of sediment floating in it, this beer was so beautiful on so many levels. I only felt a mild warming effect once I finished it off and it only added to the allure of the creamy, slick, and smooth mouthfeel of this brew. While not the best IPA that I've ever had, this may be the best of it's kind and the local equivalent of the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Worth it's lofty ratings on here, this may be the best the Tree House has to offer, which is saying a lot given their current portfolio. This was something that I can't ever get enough of! 1,655 charactersJerzDevl2000, Jun 07, 2017

3.88/5  rDev -15.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to DustinGalvin for this 16 oz. can. The can is green, too. I would love to see a green batch of wort. Canned date 4/26/17. Practically dusty. 
I was hoping the beer would follow suit but alas, no shamrock IPA for me. Looks like pureed banana, peel & all. Smells tropical without any specifics, like standing in the middle of a Dole plan. Dead middle. Without leaning towards any specific fruit assembly line. 
Green leans towards the fruit/vegetable category than IPA. Lots of fruit: I get the tangerine & pineapple, along with a slurry of other stuff, much of it pulpy. Drinks more like a smoothie than a beer. Bitterness is moderate mid-palate, plus fresh-mown right field grass & a parting shot of mango. Thick, & the high point is the drink ability; this should come in slop buckets.  
Tastes like it should have an umbrella in & be served on the beaches of Varadero. A very good beer, but, really? 913 charactersmaximum12, May 13, 2017

The nose on this beer is so tropical and floral that I'm sure the unsuspecting would never guess they are smelling a beer. Green taste like a tropical mixed drink.

Just a glorious hop explosion that is some of the finest nectar the world has to offer coats the palate and rides out gracefully with the malt and yeast backbone.  This may overtake haze as my favorite treehouse beer and is easily the best regular American IPA I have ever had, by a wide margin. 519 charactersVeejuh, Apr 22, 2017

Smell is juicy and lovely. Most of the citrus family is prominent here, and I love the lime.
The taste is very much like the nose, all citrus all the time here. Adds a bit of grass to the finish.
Just like all Tree House, very soft and smooth. Great to drink.
Overall, a superb beer, huge on the citrus and really easy to drink. 372 charactersJamFuel, Apr 19, 2017

Pours like pulped orange juice with a loose frothy head. Nose is sweet and resinous with some nice mango notes in there. Very tropical and very juicy. The taste has a nice hoppy bite to it that really gives this beer depth (something I couldn't find in Julius). Nicely balanced between hop bitterness, juicy tropical fruit, and a light malt bill.

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Snagged Julius and Green at the brewery yesterday. Cracked Green the same day it was brewed, after 2-3 hours in the fridge to chill. Pouring it into a pint glass I immediately catch the rich aroma of hops and fruit, which is remarkably potent. Once in the glass the beer is completely opaque.
The taste of the beer very closely follows the smell. It is rich, incredibly flavorful, complex and yet smooth as can be. Unlike Julius, which I found to be a tad subdued for my liking, Green packs an intense burst of hops that fills your mouth with each sip and then fades without any bitterness whatsoever.  It is truly remarkable.
Green is as good or better than anything I have previously drank.  I have nothing to criticize, except that I cannot buy it at my local beer store.  Find it and enjoy. 796 charactersDaggs911, Mar 30, 2017

4.41/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very hazy muddled orange color. The orange is quite bright and almost glows in the light. Thin off white head dissipates quickly leaving plenty of white lacing and some spotty residual head. 
Smell has notes of orange, tangerine, mango, pineapple and some grass. Nice fruity aroma, but there is clearly some bitter hop notes on the nose in the grass notes. 
Taste follows the nose with lots of tropical fruit - mango, pineapple, orange, and a bit of white grape - giving way to a nice orange rind bitterness mixed with some grassy notes. Definite bitterness with this one - its not straight fruit juice. 
Feel is very full bodied and super smooth. Almost creamy mouthfeel. 
Overall a really well crafted outstanding brew. Im not sure I think it warrants a perfect BA score, but its still an outstanding beer. 820 charactersFBarber, Mar 26, 2017

Darker than I was expecting. Muddled hop juice, just the way I like it.
Smell isn't powerful. Little citrus and tropics coming off.
It's good, not what I was expecting, but good. Sweetness and tropics up front followed by the faintest bitterness. I think it's the way the malt plays with the Galaxy. Just not a huge fan. It's a solid beer though, reminds me of Focal Banger. Also, drinking this next to a Swish and DDH Congress St makes it harder to compete with than against a Heineken. Looking forward to trying more from the Beer Advocate powerhouse. Haze and Bright w Citra are up next.
Great mouthful. Smooth and I just want more despite the taste not being my favorite.
Overall, a pretty delicious beer. Not a 100 by any means IMO, but I'd drink it all day long if I could.

He said the same thing about the two he had...There was something wrong with the beer and I love this style- juicy style IPA. The beer was so flawed I dumped both after a couple of sips. It literally tasted worse than my worst homebrews so there must have been a one off issue with this batch. No legible date stamp on the cans except for a 17'. Hopefully I get to try this one again as it clearly is a great beer, just not the case with the batch I had though. 579 characterswskee, Mar 12, 2017

Aroma has a lot of pineapple and orange and grass. There's a little bit of bubble gum, pine, and stone fruit in there too.
Taste is a combination of orange, grass, and bubble gum. Not excellent but good. There's quite a bit of peach mid palate which melds into a solid but subdued grapefruit bitterness. Hints of pineapple and orange rind and passion fruit along the way too.
When they say Tree House beers are creamy, this one is the cream of the crop. Medium bodied, incredibly smooth and creamy, low to moderate carbonation.
While this is definitely a very good beer it's not my favorite flavor profile. It is however, the best example of a creamy smooth mouthfeel in NEIPAs. What matters: I'd never turn one down. 853 charactersHoppy_Time, Mar 08, 2017

A: The body is glowy yellow, having a perfect color and on top, a half a finger thick white head with lots of retention and lacing.
S: The aroma has some small citrus tones followed by a giant resinous and hoppy profile. It's promising.
T: The taste is very simple and straightforward, yet, tremendously good - it begins with a pineapple/mango sweetness, getting also some tangerine sweetness, suddenly turning to a bitter basis, coming from hops, pineapple and citrus, specifically tangerine. It's very good to see a simple taste like this being brought to beer these days.
M: Body is medium to medium high. Carbonation is perfect. Bitterness is high.
O: Probably my favourite IPA so far. Not fruity as Pliny but tremendously 'human'. 761 charactersjoaopmgoncalves, Feb 21, 2017

Taste is great citrus upfront with great hoppy flavor throughout. Feel is full and round what you want in this style. Uncertain why other's don't emulate this? Not the best beer I have ever had but close to it. I would say I would get it again but that is a whole other story. Hopefully with their expansion availability becomes less of an issue. 456 charactersRugg315, Feb 12, 2017

L: Hazy orange, thin head of foam, good amount of lacing.
S: Strong hop aroma as soon as you crack the can.
T: So hoppy up front with a good dose of bitterness, but quickly fades to tropical fruit a la so many of the Treehouse IPAs. Noticeable booze taste at the tail end, to be expected for 7.6%.
F: Dry compared to other "juicy" East coast IPAs, but I like that! 
O: Not as intriguing as Julius but satisfies that hop-packed IPA desire. Challenges for top 5 IPAs I've had up til now. 513 characterstonybonvechio, Feb 09, 2017

S: aromas of cotton candy , pineapple, orange, orange rind
T: I was greeted with mostly naval orange like flavors blending with light pineapple and cotton candy sugars lightly caramelized.  The beer is pretty balanced for an 8% not too sweet or too bitter which is somewhat strange since I possibly was expecting a sweeter mixture / blend of hops.   As it warmed a little more, some more flavors became a little more detectable.  
M:  medium body  with a mild carbonation
O:  overall, this is a solid American IPA.  Not oberbittered and not too sweet, which see,s to be what I am enjoying more often than not rather than the earlier IBU wars which were too bitter and not as well dry hopped. 739 charactersalpinebryant, Feb 07, 2017

Appear: A hazy dense citrus look with a 1-2 finger amount of thick white foam. As soon as you see it you want a drink
Smell:  A piney smell with a super blend of citrus. There seems to be some tropical notes in there with slight grapefruit. Again the smell says hurry and take a drink.
Taste: Has that West Coast flavor with more grapefruit flavor than the smell led me to believe. Really hoppy flavor that blends nicely with the citrus. There is some orange in their with the pine and other citrus notes. Great blended taste consistent through the glass. 
Feel: Smooth with a hoppy bitterness thrown in. Not really thick but not leaning that way. 
Overall: Fantastic complex brew. It has the hops I really like with a citrus blend that make it so drinkable. Another great Tree House brew. 838 charactersKdouble, Jan 28, 2017

Appear: poured a beautiful hazy light citrus with about a fingers worth of off white dense foam.  gorgeous.  
Smell: DANK.  maybe obvious but damn that smells nice.  IT's a nice blend of citrus and piney notes.  A little grassy there's some grapefuirt pith going on.  some tropical notes but they're subtle.  I'm getting much more green herbal notes 
Taste: alot of grapefruit pith on the palate.  bitter.  THis is definitely the "hoppiest" NE style brew I've had.  It has all the NE style characteristics but with an almost West COast flavor.  More piney citrus notes.  I don't get alot of orange or mango flavors that you normally get from some NE stlyes.  Can notes that Galaxy is the main hop here.  Creamy bitter yummy.  
Feel:  Smooth delicious feel.  Not too creamy just a nice amount.  But it's like a creamy bitter.  
Over:  INteresting brew.  I really like it.  It's only my second by TH but I like it.  It has alot of notes from well made West Coast IPAs that I kind of miss since I've gotten more into NE style brews and so to find those notes in a creamy mouth is nice. 1,158 charactersGumbo_gravy, Jan 08, 2017

S: Incredible, super juicy.  Has mango, peach, light citrus, and a little pineapple.  Also has a little creamy aroma.  As noticeable to me is a bubble gum like sweetness. 
T: Upfront is bitter, grapefuit pith.  Mango comes through here as well.  Even a little citrus sour notes as well.  Malt is biscuity, somewhat like a cracker.  Present on the finish and rounds out the flavor.
F: Very smooth, and easy drinking.  Definitely full bodied though it doesn't take away from drinkability.  Crushable, though I'd rather save this.  Bitterness is pretty high, not sharp but sustained.  Mildly astringent.  
O:  Great beer, fruit on this one is insane.  So easy drinking.  Aroma is out of this world and incredibly complex 880 charactersedward_boumil, Jan 08, 2017

Pours into the lightest haze of the Tree House beers I've had. Smell is crispy hop with fruity hints. Tastes less bitter than expected and more juicy, like a subtler version of the fruitier TH brews. The hop backbone is a bit more obvious though, with the hop-volume turned up a bit. Feel is thinner on the palette – so I have to chase the flavors a bit more as they dart between subtle orange to spruce gum. Like other TH offerings, it's smoother drinking than you'd expect. A terrific beer. 592 charactersSicilianDefenseR, Jan 01, 2017

Aroma is quite impressive with fruity citrus qualities that are a little tropical before getting herbal and almost minty. 
Taste is not as bright and pungent with hop flavors as the aroma suggests but its still quite good. Citrus pith, rind and a little herbal.
Medium in body with modest carbonation. Pretty much a chuggable brew with fantastic hoppy depth to the nose and low-key bitterness. 571 charactersstakem, Dec 21, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I know this is going to sound cliche, but I want to drink this in a tree house...preferably with Dale and Brennan.
Appearance: Thick, golden/orange, hazy, perfect
Nose: Piney, dank, underripe tropical fruit, some sweetness, literally the beer to be consumed in a forest on a summer day
Taste: Do I really need to continue? Okay fine, twist my arm I'll have another sip and keep writing. The taste is initially pineapple and underripe mango (tastes in a very real way--well--green), hops come on strong with that class NE subtle bitterness that just sort of hang out in a nice way, very unlike someone who has overstayed their welcome.
Green and Julius are in a never ending struggle over my beer drenched heart. 715 charactersaac5269, Dec 19, 2016

4.7/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Tree House Green
A: Like all Tree House beers, this pours completely opaque, letting no light through. The pure white head is about two fingers tall and has excellent retention. Lacing is also great. There is no visible large particulate, but it is so comically murky as to be off-putting. If not for the head, one could easily mistake this for a glass of pulpy orange juice. It is not quite to the ridiculous Juice Machine or Doppelganger level, but it is too much even for the substyle. 4.5/5
A: "Green" is not what comes out of the aroma at all. Sure, it is less overtly fruity than other TH offerings,  it this still screams tropical, juicy fruit; in fact, it actually smells quite a bit like that titular gum. There is lots of orange, melon, and peach up front. Pineapple and a little grapefruit play supporting roles. Guava is notable as well. There is a hint of vegetation toward the back, but it is hardly obvious. Sugar cookie malt underpins the hops, as well as some yeasty bread. Thankfully there is no noticeable "unfinished" aroma that so many Tree House beers suffer from. Aside from a misleading name (yes, the story behind it has nothing to do with actual tasting notes), this is a very good smelling beer. 4.5/5
T: Though Tree House tends to eschew bitterness almost completely in their hop-forward beers, this one definitely has some of that much-needed balance. The Australian hop alluded to on the can is almost certainly Galaxy, which contributes loads of orange juice, melon, tangerine, pineapple, Juicy Fruit gum, guava, and finally its signature simultaneous piney, spicy, pithy, grassy bitterness, which lingers on and on and on. There are also notes of ruby grapefruit, mango, and lime. The malts are slightly sweet but mostly bready and hidden, a platform for the intense hoppiness to stand on. The one flaw is a weird classic pink bubblegum flavor that crops up here and there and throws the palate for a loop. There are no obvious yeast flavors or that off flavor that is present in other Tree House beers. This is a tour de force of hops and is perfectly balanced. What more can one ask for? 4.75/5
M: Typical Tree House creaminess and fullness, plus a very welcome bitterness that keeps the palate from fatiguing in the wake of juicy sweetness. The finish is actually moderately dry. Carbonation is soft and pleasant. No detectable alcohol even at 7.6%. Beers like this are so enjoyable to drink. 5/5
O: Do not listen to the hype on Julius, Juice Machine, King Julius, etc., as this is the Tree House beer to seek out. It is balanced in a way that the rest of them are not. It does not have off, unfinished flavors. It does not come off more like fruit juice and less like beer. This is Tree House's masterpiece, and do not let anyone tell you otherwise. As a result of standing in the shadow of its brothers, this one is easier to acquire as well. No, it is not the dank, "green" beer that perhaps one would expect based on the can and name, but it is a near-perfect example of the NE IPA style and comes closest to dethroning Trillium and The Alchemist's Focal Banger as Tree House has to this point. Pair with the partially ignored gem (by the masses) in an otherwise overrated discography, "Kid A" by Radiohead ("OK Computer" is also excellent, however). 4.75/5 3,301 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Dec 01, 2016

This beer looks just about perfect. Super, super hazy medium gold/yellow with tight compact head. The aroma reminds me of Julius with awesome orange candy flavors. Overall aroma is super tropical, lots of Pineapple. Flavor translates over to the palate really well but with a strong citrus pith bitterness. Mouthfeel is dead on perfect. This beer was super hyped for me and I'm happy to say that it meets those expectations...but it's not better than Julius. 98.5 points! 574 charactersMikeyMcD86, Nov 28, 2016

Treehouse Green 
Pours a hazy orange,  thick lasting head that leaves a heavy lacing on the glass and surface of the beer.
Aroma is citrus rind, grapefruit, orange peel, underlying sweetness highly hop floral tones.
Taste follows aroma floral hoppyness initially, citrus peel bitterness, grapefruit, orange, light underlying sweetness slight grassy notes on the finish...Bitterness lingers on the swallow.
Mouth feel is quite full,  velvety, moderate carbonation. 509 charactersazurel, Nov 20, 2016

Smells of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, biscuit, tangerine, floral hops, lemongrass, faint caramel, fresh cut grass, pineapple and biscuit with some more orange at the end to make it light and airy.
Tastes of potent bitter orange juice, lemon, pineapple, clementine, guava, toasted grains, grape soda, piney hops, fresh cut grass and a mix of weed and caramel sweetness. Really well balanced and pretty damn close to perfect in it's complexities. Great stuff.
Mouthfeel was crisp yet creamy and smooth, with a slight bitterness, lots of toasted grains and a semi-clean finish with lots of hops and grains as it fades. A simply delicious beer, thanks Chris D for sharing. 891 charactersCHickman, Nov 18, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours like OJ (typical). Almost 0% transparency. Beautiful golden hue.
Nose is tropical. Pineapple and orange stand out. Followed by some light earthy undertones and a light to moderate maltiness. 
Taste follows the nose almost exactly. It is a unique profile for an IPA. The combination of flavors is like  tropical cucumber melon - if you will. 
MF is on point. Expertly balanced. So velvety smooth. On par with the other Tree House heavyweights (King J, Juice Machine, etc.)
One of my favorite IPA's. One worth seeking out that is semi-regularly available, relatively speaking. 580 characterssmitty2282, Nov 03, 2016

4.17/5  rDev -8.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This is the muckiest and murkiest beer I have ever seen. No filtration whatsoever, and I think they added in some more particles to it cause there was a large mud slick at the bottom of the can. Regardless, the beer is very good, but I am not huge on this one due to it's being a bit off the beaten path for me. But, I suggest you try one as it is a thoroughly enjoyable experience as I will in the future.
This is an excellent beer, but I find it to be a hair lower into the Outstanding category. 498 charactersSuperChugLosAngeles, Nov 02, 2016

Hop resin, orange, and generalized citrus character is present as well. Definitely juicy. Taste is sweet and citrusy up front with a dry bitter on the back end. Classic NE IPA but just a touch too bitter for my own taste (not overtly so however).  Feel is kind of thick for the style as the haziness is an indication of the particulate floating around. Excellent beer overall that is a touch too bitter for my own tastes but most would not find anything objectionable about it. Treehouse for the win; again. 569 charactersAmguerra305, Oct 26, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A nuclear blast of fresh cut pineapples, sweet tangerines, and the fabled tropical fruit cocktail of papaya, guava, and mango dominate the nose upon first whiff. Behind the initial bells-and-whistles lay a solid foundation of bitter grapefruit peels, and sure enough, the "orange sherbet." Tree House's signature yeast combination of white pepper, earthy spice, and grass surface toward the back as the brew warms up. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As expected, the palate follows the nose admirably. Pungent tropical fruits, canned pineapples, and pink grapefruit juice is the initial sensation on the tongue, followed by a supporting cast of lemon rinds, sweet bread-like maltiness, and the Tree House yeasty spice. After the firework display of fruit-derived flavors subside, a tsunami of bitter resinous pine and grass wash over and linger on far after they've been extinguished from the palate.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Thick, creamy mouthfeel with a gorgeous full-ish body, verging on purée; feels slick and oily around the tongue and sticky on the lips, sip after sip. The brew sports a gentle, tongue-tickling carbonation, making it the perfect sipper -- like the two other Tree House beers I've tried, however, I can't imagine drinking more than one of these at a time or a different beer after drinking this without constantly being reminded of this one the entire time (hoppy burps ftw) 1,408 charactersamano_h, Oct 17, 2016

4.77/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Okay, now this is a tasty IPA but a bit odd as it's got a lot tropical notes but they pair better with the hops than the Julius does. This was kegged on September, 27, 2016.
The color is hazy goldenrod with a nice yellowish white head that has great retention and lacing.
The nose is that of orange, pineapple and a floral bouquet. Citrus heavy, though and smelling like you about drink Sunny-D. Very interesting nose It could use more character in the floral hop arena in my opinion but a nice nose nonetheless.
Well balanced flavor however, like the nose, still not traditional. The citrus fruit is strong but is equaled by the hope character giving it a strong grapefruit flavor. Orange and pineapple at the start but a strong grapefruit finish. Slight hints of pine.
Mouthfeel is perfect for this style. The right balance of body and carbonation. The body is Light-Medium with crisp carbonation making it a very drinkable IPA.
Overall, I would drink this beer... when I'm in a tropical mood. 1,000 charactersTheBeerCarl, Oct 02, 2016

The beer pours with a murky dark yellow appearance, thick lacing on the sides, and a long lasting bubbly head. Aromas include some sharp hop spice mixed with a nice balance of tangerine and grapefruit. Taste is bitter with piney citrus hops mixed with fruits like the grapefruit from the nose. Carbonation was decent with this drink, but its heavy flavors were made approachable thanks to the medium body of the beer. Overall, excellent appearance with great characteristics overall. 525 charactersfitzy84, Oct 02, 2016

Slightly more than one finger of dense white head.  Becomes a bit soapy as it recedes, but there's solid retention and excellent lacing.  Hazy, pulpy, translucent body.  Deep orange, the color of overripe cantaloup flesh.
Aromas of pineapple, citrus, fresh-cut grass.  Picking up a lot of honeydew melon.  
Follows the nose.  Honeydew melon and bubblegum underlying the entire sip.  Tropical fruits dominate the start while the grassy and citrus (tart lemon flesh) notes dominate the finish.
Mouthfeel is typical of a Tree House IPA.  Fuller-bodied and medium carbonation for the style.  Soft.  Slightly prickly finish.
Overall an excellent IPA, but a bit sweet for my taste.  The honeydew and bubblegum notes linger  and make this beer a sipper. 852 charactersAirBob, Sep 26, 2016

4.65/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into Tree House snifter.  Hazy gold with one inch off white bubbly, foamy head that slowly dissipates to a nice ring and thin cap.
Aroma is citrusy with notes of pineapple, tangerine, orange, and a hint of grapefruit.  The citrus aroma is followed by some earthy/dank and pine/resin notes.
Taste is similar to the nose with lots of citrus flavors and finishes with piney and dank flavors.  Taste is very hop forward.  Malts are somewhat hidden but provide a creamy base.  The aftertaste is a nice mix of sweetness and hop bite.
Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy feel.  Light carbonation.
Overall an excellent IPA. 629 charactersmecmd, Sep 20, 2016

4.63/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Great IPA. Review below mine is almost my exact thoughts. Strong alcohol content but doesn't taste it, and one of the least bitter IPAs I've had. I'm not going to pretend like I can taste every note or flavor, but it's fruity, and smooth. I let someone who's doesn't typically like IPAs try it, and they loved it. Another great Treehouse beer. I don't think it's quite as good as their Julius, but it's pretty damn close. 421 charactersKrishmish, Sep 19, 2016

4.8/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75It is an exceptionnal IPA. The only one I've tasted that came close to this was from Maine Brewing Co. Green is a fresh, very fruity yet complex beer. Very balanced, I'm not gonna bother detailing all the aromas, it's just amazing, that's all you need to know. I had doubts about the hype surrounding Tree House, no more though.  I disagree that this is a hophead beer, this beer isn't very bitter nor is it challenging. Everyone should be able to enjoy it, you don't feel the 7.6% ABV at all. 493 charactersHallu, Sep 13, 2016

Look:  Pours more clear initially and then as it settles in the glass it turns into an opaque golden orange with a nice white head
Smell:  Smells of cantaloupe, pineapple and orange with hints of petrol and rubber
Taste:  A lot more cantaloupe on the palate with pine and grapefruit – my only complaint is there is a touch of heat from the 7.6% ABV
Mouth Feel:  Nice weight with a long finish that ends with some nice sweetness to balance with the bitterness of the hops
Overall:  A delicious beer that is incredibly drinkable.  I’m very impressed with the quality across the Tree House beers that I’ve had the chance to try.  This is not the best of the line-up, but still a very high quality IPA that stacks up against most other IPAs. 816 charactersyacobove, Sep 07, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had most of TH's lineup. Including a few of the rare ipas. Green may very well be my favorite. IMO it may be the most balance ipa that they put out. Its malty yet crushable. Seriously, this is the beer that I tend to get carried away with. Its very juicy, I get the pineapple juice comparison like crazy. It also has a very nice hoppy aftertaste. It is a little dank and I love it. I can almost find julius and alter to be a little thin. Green really skirts the line between an ipa and a double. Like all tree house ipas the smell is obviously great. If anything this is one of the better ones. It'll lace a glass like no other.  If I could get only one tree house brew regularly, this would probably have to be the one. Its just so well balanced and always scratches the itch no matter what mood I'm in. 809 charactersBababooeyHTJ, Sep 04, 2016

A - It's a Northeastern IPA alright; turbid and murky. Off-white foam settles to a thin cap, thicker collar, and splotchy lacing. I'm still not a fan of drinking milky looking IPAs, but I realize this is 'to style' as well.
S - Passion fruit, guava, pineapple grass, citrus peel. Pretty hoppy, juicy, stuff. Some light sugary malt in the periphery to support things.
T - The taste is a bit sweeter and punchier, with great tropical fruit, citrus, zesty flavors mixed with sweet sugar cookie malts. I normally don't like Galaxy hops but whatever else Treehouse has mixed in as tempered things. Quite a nice IPA with the balance of flavors and bitterness that I prefer. Aftertaste is very...green.
M - Oily and resinous, with lingering stickiness on the palate. Surprised that this almost 8%. Drinks more like 5-6%. Good heft, on the heavier side of medium in body. Soft, medium-low carbonation.
D - Just a really well made IPA. Really appreciate that Greg was willing to brave the lines to grab some cans. I miss the good old days when Tree House was under the radar. Would happily drink again on any occasion. 1,229 charactersMasterSki, Sep 02, 2016

Reviewed 8/31/16
Pours a light straw color with two inch foamy head. Hazier than most Tree House brews if you can believe it.
Smells sweet, tropical, fruity
Taste of Grapefruit, Pineapple, some lemon. Juicy taste, makes me salivate just remembering
Creamy on the tongue with adequate carbonation. Dry
Another excellent offering from Tree House, though they don't need my approval. Probably my favorite after SAP 431 charactersmusicsherlock, Aug 31, 2016

Pours opaque and cloudy pale orange with a thick khaki head that remains as wisps on top and leaves thick strands of lace. The smell is of bitter grapefruit juice with hints of tropical fruit and pine. The taste follows with a full texture and medium carbonation. Aggressively hopped and bitter up front and settles to a refreshing citrus bomb. 364 charactersFurlinator, Aug 26, 2016

This beer pours murky like pineapple juice, but a shade darker. It is topped with three inches of off white head that leaves behind some nice lacing. 
I get some pineapple and pine aroma.
It starts out with some pineapple and tropical fruit. Pine comes in the middle and in the finish. 
Medium to full mouthfeel for an IPA.
My first Tree House beer. It reminds me of Hoof Hearted's Roller Blabe. It is good, but it does not match the hype for my palate. I am grateful to have tried it by the generosity of a fellow beer enthusiast. I need to do more research of this brewery. 615 charactersbuschbeer, Aug 20, 2016

Turbid deep yellow/light orange haze appearance with pillowy white foam.  Smell is tropical with just a faint hint of pine. But, mostly pineapple, tangerine and other exotic fruits really deliver on the flavor with the noticeable Galaxy hops.  Creamy mouthfeel and very easy to drink.
Yet another phenomenal beer from Tree House.  As far as IPAs overall, it's between this and Julius (which has a distinctly different taste and aroma). 460 characterseifster82, Aug 09, 2016

I think it looks cool.  Smell:  Whoa!  It smells like you're opening up a can of dole cut pineapples.  Nice hop aromas around the edges of the fruit-splosion.  Just smells super fruity.  Crazy.  Taste is a really nice mix of pineapple, papaya, nice very slightly sweet malt, enriching and balanced hops.  Feel is very nice, rich, smooth, perfect carbonation.   Overall:  A must-have! 480 charactersChcshammonde, Aug 07, 2016

As the beer is consumed the head leaves bands of sticky lacing. There is a lot of pineapple and other citrus fruits in the nose. Perhaps a bit of melon and some pine as well. The taste is pineapple, a bit of sweetness and a spectacular bitter hop finish. This beer is medium bodied and creamy. This is a truly balanced and delicious beer with a great mouthfeel. 421 charactersFriedSlug, Aug 06, 2016

Looks like a hazy juice bomb.  Some lacing, but it sticks.
Smells like tangerine or oranges, but lighter on the fruit than their normal beers.  More hops on the nose.
Taste is amazing.  It's hopped up for sure.  Nice bright fruit, balanced, and juicy.
Mouth feel is medium bodied with a smooth Finish.
Overall. Love it.  They don't disappoint.  This brew was juicy with hops, and a nice finish.  Wish I had more but I only got one of these. 497 charactersJay_P22, Jul 24, 2016

3.45/5  rDev -24.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Looks like all their other beers: cloudy and yellow-orange. It smells great, but tastes unbalanced. I thought it was too cold, so let it warm a bit. No, still out of balance. Mouthfeel is like their other beers too: thick and the flavor lingers. Overall, not their best beer.
HOWEVER: I had one that was a bit over a month old (5-6 weeks, I think) and it was much better. This beer needs to sit a bit to balance out. 417 charactersGeeL, Jul 19, 2016

3.97/5  rDev -13.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Appearance is pulpy OJ with a large, foamy, bulbously lopsided eggshell colored head that leaves thin, sporadic lace.
Smell is pineapple, bright green freshly cut Christmas tree, orange, white pepper, and kiwi. It sounds like a strongly vibrant nose, but I think in this brew the aromas are subdued a touch, not sure why.
Sweet vanilla, peach, orange, with a lot of same yeast spiciness found in some Hoof Hearted beers Ohio locals tend to complain about when ultra fresh. There is also a bitter but bright element, like lemon rind.
This is a super soft beer, like bubblegum juice, and it goes down all too quickly. 618 charactersSabtos, Jul 11, 2016

   He told me, the line of people waiting for canned take home pours was long.
   Galaxy hops, man o man. Righteous hop. Herbal, dry earth,  sweet fruity layers in both aroma and flavor. Reminds me very much of the mega complex Heady Topper.  Seriously, the layers of flavor just keeps riding in. Giant, earthy, spicy, citric tropical blend of hop wonder!! The malt is also in perfect balance and very bold.
   Seriously enjoyable quoff. Easier on the pallet, but Still, each gulp held something new. The hop/malt balance being in the Heady topper region. Top shelf quality....what a sweet surprise.
   Balance is amazing and the drinkability is very high. Complexity is multi layered but easy breezy..... Tropical fruits but hig earthy tones as well. Major league complexity with multiple layers of flavor that just keeps coming!
  I had never heard of this brewery until today. Sweet surprise. Massive enjoyment. Thanks pops!! 1,072 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Jul 08, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5UPDATED REVIEW: Canned 7/12, consumed 7/17.
A: More than any other beer I’ve ever had, this beer pours like freshly squeezed orange juice. Incredibly turbid and vibrant in the glass. Puffy head of tiny bubbles sticks around for a while, leaving a thick lacing up the glass.
S: Straight up perfectly ripe, sugary sweet citrus fruit. Orange, tangerine, pineapple, peach. Subtle notes of freshly cut herbs. Doughy, sugary white bread. Ripe banana. Bubble gum. Insanely tropical and appetizing. 
T: Tropical fruit explosion. Right off the bat, Green hits you with some powerful hop flavors. The Tree House tasting notes are spot on—I definitely get the orange sorbet and pineapple. Some peach and yellow grapefruit as well. It’s initially extremely juicy without much sweetness, which allows you to really hone in on the explosion of flavor. The tropical burst transitions into the typical Tree House sweet bready yeast. Finishes with perfect level of bitterness over herbaceous notes of pine.
M: Unbelievably creamy and drinkable for a 7.5% beer. Tropical fruity flavors coat the mouth before being overtaken by a medium bitterness that accompanies the rich, piney, herbaceous aftertaste. 
O: This is my second time having Green, and I can definitively say that it is my favorite IPA (from a list that includes Julius…). The initial tropical burst is perfectly complemented by the soft, doughy mouthfeel that follows. The transition to a substantially bitter, resinous, almost vegetal herby finish is one of the most unique and enjoyable aspects of this beer. I could drink this everyday. Totally deserving of my first 5/5. 1,633 charactersavas, Jul 07, 2016

Finish stays strong and beautiful. You have no idea you're drinking almost 8%. Definitely top 20 all time brews. 392 charactersBmoylan1618, Jul 03, 2016
4.46/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.2516oz can, stamped 06.29.2016, poured into a Treehouse Teku glass.
The beer pours an expectedly turbid, cloudy and hazy golden color, orange hues with a foamy, thick, taut white head that has very good retention and yields incredible soapy lace. The aroma is very nice, citrusy, juicy with assertive bitter rind, pineapple, hop spice, resinous pine, very earthy with lots of grassiness and some light wildflower. The typical New England yeasty sweetness and light maltiness is totally an afterthought here, pure hoppiness. The flavors are amazing, really powerful tropical fruits, pineapple galore, tangerine and grapefruit juice leads to intensely bitter grapefruit peel and earthy pine sap, grassiness and wildflower again make up the finish with a really nice lingering hop spice flavor with just a touch of mineral water. The mouthfeel is fantastic, full bodied, coating, moderate carbonation, smooth and gentle with a punishingly dry and bitter kick. 
Verdict: An absolute gem of an IPA from Treehouse. Certainly one of the more bitter IPAs I've had in a long time, but it has so much flavor that is really complimented by the bitter qualities. This beer certainly lives up to the Treehouse hype, a stunner. 1,214 characterskevanb, Jul 02, 2016

Flavors are more subtle than the other Tree House brews I have had.  Medium bodied, slightly bitter, and juicy.  Heads and tails above most beers I have had, but behind Julius and Haze in my Tree House order.  Worth seeking out and an amazing IPA.  Really beginning to realize in my world, IPAs are like rauchbiers.  There is one brewery that is heads and tails above the others and Tree House is in a class by itself. 516 characterstigg924, Jul 01, 2016

4.11/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Treehouse is a very hyped up brewery and since they're only 45 minutes away, I mad it a point to check out some of their brews. Green was recommended to me I think galaxy hops are the stuff of legends when brewed right. I heard green was one of the best beers Treehouse makes, and that leaves me a little worried. It a good beer no doubt, but its not what its cracked up to be. I taste lots of peaches and a general IPA kind of taste. Overall, its a good beer, but not worth the hype.

L: 1F head, hazy straw, very pineapple juice looking thin ring
S: Pineapple and citrus all the way, light cracker malt 
T: Pineapple, orange, mango, light cracker malt. 
M: Light to medium body, light to medium carbonation. Well constructed and balanced. Long slightly bitter finish. 
O: My first TH. Very good but I am not blown away. I know, I know, it is supposed to be a religious experience or something. It's very good. I was dead exhausted Saturday night and this was after sampling two other beers, so if I get another can and the experience is different, I will update. 745 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jun 28, 2016

Retention is excellent and there are sticky, hanging rings of lacing all over the glass. Smell is pineapple, tangerine, mango and citrus pith. Taste is similar with a moderately bitter finish. Feel is medium and so so soft. Legit almost delicate, until the bitter slightly resinous finish. Overall another world class beer by Treehouse. I have it ranked slightly below the other offerings I've had from them, but it is still spectacular. 540 charactersCNoj012, Jun 24, 2016

Best of the bunch. Really outshined the others I had tonight including Haze, Julius, and Jjjuliusss. It won't be the only TH beer that I look for in the future, but it will probably have to be part of every TH trade going forward. 271 charactersLloydDobler, Jun 22, 2016

Feel: light and airy, no nasty after taste, it's extremely crisp and clean.
Overall: this is the single best IPA I've ever had.... well worth the drive to the middle of nowhere. 422 charactersFutbolmanby, Jun 16, 2016

Canned on: Apr-6-2016
A:
Pours a cloudy peach-colored orange that almost looks green-tinged if you hold it right  with a couple fingers of solid, creamy, big-bubbled head that is always there and beautiful sheets of lacing; great retention.  (4.5)
S:
Big and pungent earthy hops with light juicy fruit.  Orange creamsicle, dank hops, juniper, tart/crisp citrus, and a touch of biscuity malt in the background.  (4.5)
T:
The flavor is really layered with a wave of hearty, earthy resin that soon becomes light, tart citrus and juicy mango before dulling to a lingering, green hum of hop essence. (4.5)
M:
Medium bodied with a slight creaminess and prickly light carbonation, extremely drinkable.  (4.5)
O:
Wow, this is a great IPA.
A combination of everything that is great in the really juicy Treehouse beers masterfully mixed with the thing I kind of always felt was missing from said beers.  Pretty juicy, really resinous.  Tropical fruits and citrus are unmistakable, but the real star seems to be the sticky, oily hoppy bitterness that comes through in every part of the beer.  Also one of the prettier Treehouse beers I've had.  
Really good!  (4.75) 1,176 charactersTheDoctor, Apr 24, 2016

Pour is a beautiful murky golden orange. Very hazy and milky like pour. Small head with great lacing.
Smell is everything you can want in an IPA. Very tropical upfront, tangerines, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, more pineapple,citrus zest, lemon peel, orange.. The list goes on. Very tropical nose and not much malt or bitter presence.
Taste is a burst of what the nose offers, plus more. Insane amount of fruit here with a very subtle hop backbone, very sweet malt backbone. 
Mouthfeel is creamy, light carbonation. Almost a dole or orange juice mouthfeel with all the bursts of juices going on.
Amazing beer.. First tree house and does not disappoint. So flavorful, juicy, and tropical. 783 charactersMateo2699, Apr 10, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Green is another spectacular offering from Tree House, which may very well be my favorite brewery. It is turbid as usual with an impenetrably bright yellow orange hue. It smells very tropical as if you were taken to Jamaica. The taste reflects the smell with significant pineapple. There is some sizzling of the hops on the tongue at first, but then this beautifully pillow-like, super smooth creaminess takes over. It is hard to tell if I like Green or Julius more, but I think Julius has a slight edge. World Class Brew. 522 charactersTrevor11, Apr 02, 2016

L: Pours a beautiful light gold with a thick haze from the flaked oats and oddly, almost no head. 
S: Smells incredible. Certainly grapefruit and hops. I can smell the tangerine they mention on the can as well. 
T: Taste is absolutely delicious. Very fruity with grapefruit and tangerine up front. Piney hops (but not overloading) and maybe a touch of peach and pineapple in the background. Invigorating and juicy as if there was fresh fruit in the glass.  
F: Feel is juicy and refreshing with a bit of over-carbonation, probably to accommodate for the flaked oats. Finish is dry and crisp like you just took a bite of an apple. Almost finishes like a hard cider.   
I would drink these in the summer and probably choose it over Bissell Bros Swish to be truthful. 827 charactersStringsAreWings, Mar 26, 2016

L: Super hazy. Looks like murky pineapple juice. Wonderful thick head.
S: Very, very tropical. Like Dole tropical fruit juice. As it warms up, it has this interesting spice like quality that I get out of saisons. It's very unique and good, but I think for me it just holds it back from being perfect.
T: Exact same as the smell. 
O: Fantastic IPA, one of the best I've had. Like I mentioned, the only thing holding it back from 5's across the board is that spicy, saison like quality. Kind of resembles clove or hay.
I just want to mention that TH beers, while very intense in their own way, have this subtleness to them that doesn't make the beer overpowering. It's different, but makes the beers so incredibly drinkable. 785 characterscultclassic89, Mar 25, 2016

Look: Julius aint got nothing on this beer being hazy. This is nearly opaque. I hate the whole "look of a beer" debate going on right now but it isn't that golden haze that appeals to me. Granted, don't base the score of the look of the beer. More on that later.
Smell: Pineapple. WOW PINEAPPLE. That is all I am getting from this. A little orange and a good bit of that hop aroma, but pineapple is straight in my nose. Good smelling beer again.
Taste: Delicious. This is a "where did my beer go" kind of beer. It has a good upfront hop profile that dies a bit quick, but it isn't a palate wrecker like some beers out there. The malt backbone is nice and sweet. I could drink this beer constantly though. The alcohol is covered to a point I don't notice it at all, and the beer itself is quite refreshing. This is a fantastic beer. I will say I liked julius better, but this beer is a great beer. 
Feel: This has a good mouthfeel. The hops don't overpower you and kill your mouth, and the sweetness of the malt is there on the aftertaste. 
Overall: This is my third beer from Treehouse and they are straight killing it. I have a couple cans of Julius to confirm my opinion on that beer and lucked into getting one of the Green cans. I really enjoy this beer and will say this is a fantastic IPA. I love how it doesn't overkill my tastebuds, but rather gently massages it over the course of the drink. Again, quite jealous at the folks in MA. 1,491 charactersNhens0016, Mar 25, 2016

Aroma is very tropical with lots of pineapple, some citrus, and mango. The taste is straight juice and is heavy on the tropical fruits; mango, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and peach. Medium-light body and moderate carbonation yield a pillowy mouthfeel. Overall a good beer and an excellent representation of a New England style IPA but I just wasn't feeling it. 454 charactersmnj21655, Mar 23, 2016

Smells like a combination of all the tropical fruit juices you have ever smelt.
Tropical juice flavors forward, with mango, papaya, guava, pineapple, lime and orange; stone fruit flavors as well.
Green is perfection. A text book New England IPA. 404 charactersskeeterloveshops, Mar 20, 2016
4.74/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer is magical. Canned on 3/15, it produces a cloudy orange appearance with significant head and plenty of lace from start to finish. It smells like sex on a platter. Pineapple and clean sweat. Imagine making love to Elisha Cuthbert and all you can smell is her hair, and that Victoria's Secret body spray she uses, liberally. This is that smell. Fresh, over ripe and bursting with aroma. Mango lassi in beer form. The taste follows but with different layers of tropical goodness, and that tongue smacking bitterness that you expect and deserve from an IPA. Seared peach skin, orange rind, gentle coriander, grainy cracker, faint pear. All of that. The feel is Hayden Panettiere on the tongue. So smooth, so soft, so gentle. It lays on the tongue just long enough to remind you how good Tree House does what they do best - IPAs. Believe the hype; this company is the upper echelon of IPA. They never fail to disappoint. All scores warranted, all pours are the shit. Larrrrrrrrrrrge. 988 charactersTheIPAHunter, Mar 19, 2016

I have reviewed several TH beers already.  This beer is like most of other TH beers.  Start at a 4.25 on everything and go up from there.  Color is like every other IPA from TH.  Smell is like a cousin of Sap as it is more "green".  The taste can be compared to Sap but has that more earthy back end I like. 
Overall just trade, but, hunt down this beer.  It's a must try as it is one of the more constant offerings at TH. 549 charactersBEEPOP, Mar 11, 2016

I am not a fan of IPAs but these guys intrigued me as I heard they are juicy as opposed to bitter and all the acclaim and hullaballoo is well-deserved. Looks thick and hazy like apple juice/cider color. Smells like tropical, citrus juice and mango nectar.  Thick silty mouthfeel.  I taste pineapple juice and lemon-lime Gatorade with additional citrus notes and some wheat.  None of that west coast Cali bitterness that attacks the throat which is why I do not care for IPAs.  This beer opened my eyes to the world of the Juicy East Coast IPA. A JPA - Juice Pale Ale. Excellent beer! 602 charactersJAStheAce, Feb 29, 2016

This beer can not be seen through at all. its so thick and pulpy looks just like grapefruit juice.the aroma is out of this world one of the best aromas on a beer I have ever smelled. So much going on I picked up,tropical orange juice,grape fruit juice,rainbow sherbet,a little green onion grassy flavor.the aroma is AMAZING!!!!!!
 The taste fell a little short for me, if it followed more along with the aroma it would have been flawless. It was mostly a pure grapefruit juice bomb. at times I forgot I was drinking beer I thought it was juice. There were small amounts of mango and pineapple flavors finishing with a earthy green onion grassy finnish. Overall this beer was fantastic!!!!!!! 810 charactersdertyd, Feb 27, 2016

I made a trade a while back that included either you or Dr. J and I feel I would be lost without either of you.  Green is a dank, delicious, juicy, treat, that packs just a little bit more punch than Julius, but also drinks like something you could have in the morning with your bacon and eggs. 392 charactersSilkyGJohnston, Feb 24, 2016

4.62/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the 16oz can dated 02/16/16 into a snifter glass last night, 5 days old. Comes out this beautiful hazy bright gold with some orange hues, nice off white head leaves lacing.
Smell is just dank, wet carpet, tropical fruit, tons of hop juice. Flavor is much sweeter and fruitier than the nose implies. Sweetness right off the bat, decent malt bill provides a slight resistance to the hop onslaught. Notes of pineapple, mango, orange sherbert. Finishes with a ton of hop oil, lingering. Smooth creamy mouthfeel, decent body for an IPA, maybe a bit heavy. Overall one of the better beers I've had, super yummy. 618 charactersBranfordBound, Feb 23, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Purchased on 17Feb 2016 and imbibed 18Feb2016.  Poured from can to Duvel tulip.  This was a must visit as it was only 45min out of the way from my trip from Milford, CT to Winooski, VT for Heady Topper.    
A: Hazy, almost glowing orange-yellow; completely opaque; thick pure white head overflowing the glass.  Beautiful!
S: Peppery, hopped, pineapple and tangerine… very well balanced.
T: The orange really comes through here… beautiful citrusy, sweet hops with a nice, bitter finish.
M: On the thinner side with medium carbonation, but the flavors and aromas just hold on…
O: I got well over a month supply of Heady on the 9hr drive, but will make it a weekly Wed. can run to Tree House based on this beer.  In comparison to Heady it is difficult to compare.  We almost need a straight hoppy and citrusy, sweet hoppy category with Green being the latter.  Heady would slightly edge out Green, but I will wake up craving this one when it is gone 952 charactersjoezak5, Feb 20, 2016

The limit was 6 and I bought them up. Some people were even bringing their non beer drinking friends with them so they could get more...it's that good.
Pours a hazy gold/orange (looks like juice). Smells crazy!!! Like tropical fruit bubblegum/mango and pine, fresh almost to the point of being ridiculous. The taste is explosive and juicy with just the right amount of bitterness. Perfect in every way. 532 charactersMcGee666, Feb 18, 2016

Canned yesterday (2/16)
L - Perfect cloudy orange/yellow with finger of foam
S - Perfect orange pineapple
T - Perfect balance of citrus and just the right amount of bitterness.  
F - Perfect

01 26 16
Served in a pint glass
Totally opaque, orangey-amber appearance. The body looked exactly like orange juice. With an aggressive pour, a creamy, frothy, off-white, one-finger tall head topped the liquid. A bit smaller than I anticipated. The crown fell rather quickly to a clingy film. Streaky, splotchy lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was insanely hoppy and fragrant. Initially, the beer smelled like pure guava juice. Super fruity and bright. Later, a mix of overripe tropical fruits came through strong. Mango was noticeable. Really dank and weed-like. This reminded me a lot of fresh bud. As the head died down, the aroma became a bit more subtle. Peach notes however came forth. All in all, intensely juicy and sweet.
The flavor profile was mesmerizing. Perfect mix of citrus and tropical fruits. Loads of sweetened white grapefruit and overripe mango. Big zesty orange and tangerine presence. Peach notes also came through strong. Candied grapefruit peel appeared in the finish. Bit of pineyness. Amazingly well balanced. Dank, herbal, weed-like notes also came through big time. I definitely did not find this beer to be as resiny or as bitter as others have noted.
As impressive as the aroma and flavor profile were, the mouthfeel was even better. Insanely soft. Super creamy, smooth and supple on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, frothy, moderate effervescence that made the liquid feel like a pillow. Simply put, flawless.
I have absolutely loved every beer that Tree House has released to date, but Green might just be my favorite overall. This is a ridiculously flavorful and well crafted Northeast-style juice bomb that contains just enough bitterness to be insanely crushable. Proof once again that Tree House Brewing crafts the best hoppy beers on planet earth. 1,882 charactersDamian, Feb 04, 2016

While I appreciate that Green is different from Julius, Haze, Alter Ego.  I feel that all 3 are superior to Green.
That being said,  Green is a very good-great beer.
Look- little lighter than the Julius orange.  Not quite straw.
Smell-  Dank, musty hops
Taste-  like earlier state,  Very good to great
Feel-  Little less creamy than Julius, but still very well done
Overall-   My 6th fav TH IPA (Behind  Julius, KJ, Alter Ego, Doppel and Haze) 479 charactersjcflorian, Feb 01, 2016

Hazy and murky apricot colored with a white head that rises up minimally and settles out quickly, leaving lots of legs and lace.
Aroma of citrus and scallion, some tangerine and grapefruit.
Flavors of hops burst out, matching the nose well.  Lots of citrus, some scallion, grapefruit and subtle mango, but also solventy, some alcohol vapors mix in.  Not overly bitter.  A honey malt balance rides beneath.
Full mouthfeel, but a bit slick, finishes tingly.  Very good beer, but not sure I'd drive two hours round trip and wait in line another hour. 587 charactersfar333, Jan 31, 2016

It's not as aromatic as I expected it to be. Flavor is wonderful. Little to no bitterness. It has that Treehouse papaya-y malt base, but fortunately, the Australian hops provide a nice contrast. I really like the mouthfeel. It is chewy, gummy. I think it plays better in this beer than a Julius, if I am picking up a similar malt bill/flavor. 448 charactersSheppard, Jan 28, 2016

The look of this beer is not that great, kind of a murky brownish/orange-ish liquid with a nice white head that leaves a ton of lacing. The smell is very good for an IPA. Nothing outstanding but you can tell from the nose you are about to drink an IPA. The flavor is outstanding! great orange sherbet, pineapple, orange juice bomb with a slight bitterness. the mouthfeel is very good as the beer is a little light on carbonation. Definitely feel that light carb adds to the flavor profile. 597 charactersshmorf, Jan 14, 2016
4.79/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.7516oz can dated 1/5/16 poured into Teku glass on 1/14/16. 
Look: Pours  identical to orange juice. One finger of small, tight white-yelllow bubbles with sparse larger bubbles towards the center of the glass. Excellent head retention and lacing. Uncanny ability to rouse a thick, luscious head with agitation no matter how long it's been sitting in the glass. Seriously. Give it a try. 
Smell: Pine, papaya, mango, guava, citrus. 
Taste: Citrus initially. Tangerine, orange, clementine. Distinctly un-grapefruit-like, which is a nice change from what seems to be a growing trend amongst other similar offerings. Followed strongly by pine which lingers between sips.
Feel: Moderate-low carbonation. Surprisingly thick and creamy mouthfeel initially, but finishes dry and crisp. 
Overall: Another fantastic offering from Tree House. Drinkability is fantastic, 7.5% is hidden well. Enjoyed thoroughly the balance of pine vs. fruit. 931 charactersPCole, Jan 14, 2016
4.88/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a super hazy opaque orange yellow. Smell is super juicy hops with a powerful mixture of citrus fruit, and a touch of melon. Mouthfeel is impressively full while drinking juicy and smooth.
Taste is pure hop art. Lots of punch from the hops with many layers of flavors. Super citrus bitterness...however it's accompanied with a juicy melon flavor. The intense hop flavor lingers on the tounge.
One of the best beers I've ever had and my favorite I've had thus far from treehouse. It's truly a wonderfull IPA and a true experience of a beer. 546 charactersWhimpers, Jan 13, 2016

L:  Hazy, but bright with color.  Medium head with good lacing and white in color.
S:  Fresh squeezed orange juice, quava, mango, ecstacy.  I want to smell it as much as I want to drink it.
T:  Delicious, fruity, sharp, a hint of spice.  Unlike any other beer I've had before.

4.44/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Canned on 12-1-15 and poured into my Goose Island nonic pint.
A- Pours just like the other Tree House beers I have had so far, extremely hazy and almost looking like juice in the glass. A sizeable, 3-4 finger head forms and retains for days with amazing lacing. It quite literally looks like a glass of poured, carbonated orange juice in my glass.
S- Even in the can just over a month, the big, juicy, citrus hops still hit the nose with a vengeance. Fairly prominent are orange and other citrus notes, as well as the tangerine mentioned on the can. The back end of the scent is a tad bit more piney than the front end, but the citrus and bright tones still outweigh the pine and cedar notes.
T- The first flavor to hit the tongue is a melange of citrus fruit and moderate bitterness from the hops. Right after the initial hop bite, the citrus fruit flavor profile kicks in a little stronger and displays a light orange and tangerine flavor to accompany a mild bitterness. The back end of the drink is much more resinous and pine-forward in its bitterness. These same, late-drink flavors are the lingering notes on the tongue.
M- Just as the look follows the trend of other Tree House beers, the feel is much the same as well. The body is a tad thin, but not terribly so, and the carbonation level is slightly on the low end of the spectrum for an IPA. It drinks incredibly smooth and is very easy going down.
Overall, this is my second favorite Tree House can to Julius. The addition of the slightly more bitter and piney Galaxy hop is a good addition that brings a little more traditional IPA bitterness to the drink. In the end, another solid Massachusetts offering. 1,674 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jan 13, 2016

4.38/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a completely clouded grapefruit juice color with a big, spongy head. Actually, this beer looks pretty neat in its own, headstrong, dirty way.
On the nose, a blend of resin and prickly lemon pulp creates the foundation of the aromas in this. An oat sweetness, together with a bready malt appeal provides a subtle, but well integrated balance, maintaining the focus almost entirely on the hops. Fruity lemon zest settles on top of this, blending into sweeter, not yet ripe, exotic fruits.
While not being too vivid on the carbonation, the mouthfeel  completely soothes out any possible harshness from the profound hops, establishing an astonishing softness on the tongue, which tends to turn almost creamy during the finish.
Tastes of a soft aqueous quality up front, already establishing the beers gorgeous mouthfeel, with juicy lime cutting through in a very refreshing, playful way, allowing the flavor foundation to unfold its silkiness peaceable. Citrus blends into fruity, sweet sorbet, somewhere between woodruff jello, ripe orange and fresh cut grass in a cloudburst. Finishes with its already mentioned, yet defining, soft mouthfeel, mellowing all other flavors of the beer down to a minimum, only to invite a water melon accompanied hop dryness to the tongue, which lasts for decades.
Doubtlessly this beer is green. That is due to its unique sorbet-like middle part, as for its initial lime dryness and late grass dankness. These three flavors create a highly enjoyable synergy, guided by the world class mouthfeel in this, opening up the term softness to a whole new level. The more the beer warms up, the more obvious becomes its uncompromising hop onslaught, getting balanced by the beers smoothness instead of creating a malty backbone, preventing a hindering, hop decreasing sweetness. 1,809 charactersaleigator, Jan 09, 2016

4.17/5  rDev -8.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Probably the ugliest IPA I have seen in a while. Murky orangish, greenish, brown with a dense white head. Aroma is intense hop presence of tangerines, lemons, and pale malts. Really impressive smell.  Flavor starts of as strait fruit juice come at you in waves of orange rind, grapefruit, and some dank, grassy flavors. The finish though is somewhat off for me. Some astringency is there or possibly even some burnt notes that comes in about 10 sec after each sip. Body is creamy for the style, but I can dig it. 
Overall, I wanted to love it, but ended up really liking it. Really appreciate the uniqueness of this one though. 627 charactersBosoxfan20, Jan 08, 2016

Pours a super hazed-out orange beige hue, nice looking head and lacing. Smells of clementines, stone fruit, honey dew, & pineapple skin. Pungent hop flavor, ample bitterness. Ripe kiwi, fresh cut grass, orange rind, faint green peppercorn, & subtle pine on the palate. Not sure if you can pack anymore hop flavor into this beer. Love the pushing of the boundaries here, glad to see that the brewer's intention gives us a reason of why it looks the way it does. Cheers to that. Instant hop fix, drinkable for only the hardest of hopheads. A lot of fun knocking this one back, kiss of alcohol in the finish helps keep the hops in check a bit. 670 charactersJason, Jan 08, 2016

I am fortunate enough to have had  the best east coast IPAs ( Heady, Focal, Sunshine, Session 2, G Bot, Lunch) and this is my absolute favorite. It was fairly easy to get as well. I drove to the brewery this evening, they where open 12 to 6 for cans only. I arrived at 5:15 and had a line of about 15 or so. Very well organized, moved quickly. 8 can limit on Julius and Green, so I grabbed the max. $60 for 16 is a steal for this quality. Color is freaky awesome orange haze, nice thick white head. Smell is super pineapple and citrus smell. Taste is even more intense if pineapple and citrus. Nice sweet malty taste, a thick and rich finish. Each taste gets better. Thank you Tree House! Amazing beer. You have another loyal customer! 779 characterstconlon69, Jan 07, 2016

Smell - Citrus, pineapple, mango. I've said this before, Tree House brews have a very distinct and pleasant scent to them.
Taste - one of my favorites from Tree House. Nicely balanced and smoooooooth! An initial pop of piney hops, followed by orange and pineapple, with a nice swish of maltiness at the end, which I'm a sucker for. Now that I'm finishing this can, I'm noticing some grapefruit as an aftertaste as well.
Feel - medium body and carbonation which is perfect for this beer (Tree House nails the mouth feel with all their IPA's). 
Overall - this is a home run for me. The extra little bit of malt really balances this one out. I have nothing negative to say about this beer... other than I wish I had a lot more. 868 charactersBillErickson, Dec 31, 2015

4.83/5  rDev +5.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a very turbid honey golden orange color with two fingers of an off-white head. Looks like grapefruit juice. One of the best looking beers I've seen.
Aroma is insane. Get lots of juicy fruit gum (sounds crazy but that's the best I can describe it), orange sorbet, tangerine, peach, pineapple, and mango. The name lends itself well, as I get a good amount of herbaceous dankness and green herbal hop notes as well.
Tastes starts juicy as hell, as I get overly ripe mango and pineapple with an undercurrent of that dankness. Once again very reminiscent of juicy fruit gum. Middle layers on top of the juicy tropical notes orange sorbet, tangerine, and some sweet grapefruit. The finish is semi-dry, but leaves a good amount of lingering juicy fruit sweetness. Still getting the orange sorbet, pineapple, and mango long into the finish. There's some soft orange peel/dank and green bitterness too.
Medium body. Smooth carbonation. A very pillowy and soft mouthfeel. Relatively clean finish.
This is yet another outstanding IPA from the guys over at Tree House. I think I may prefer this one over Julius because of the green hop (dank, herbal) quality it provides in addition to the juicy fruits. A mind-blowing experience drinking this one. 1,246 charactersbrewskis, Dec 30, 2015

Pours a cloudy, almost muddy grapefruit. Powdery white, 1.5 finger head with excellent retention. Lacing is layered and thick with great stick. The unfiltered IPA looking is really growing on me. 
Nose is a bouquet of fresh cut grass, citrus, pineapple and kiwi. Big malt presence with an even bigger fruit component. Excellent and fantastically aromatic. 
Opens pineapple, grass and a light resiny, sappy  presence. Orange juice and tangerine in the middle mixed with pineapple and other tropical fruit flavors. Juicy towards the end with a pungent, aromatic tropical fruit hop bitterness that finishes dry, filmy and sappy. Lightly hop forward aftertaste with plenty of citrus and pineapple. Fantastic!
Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and goes down juicy and messy. Finishes dry with a lingering, filmy aftertaste. So drinkable!
Between this and Julius, its not even fair, the quality of IPAs that Tree House is putting out. Unbelievably good. 1,022 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 28, 2015

4.49/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received this can as part of a trade thanks to BA MVB1121. I've had Green once before, but it was about a year ago and I didn't take any notes, so I was happy to get another shot. Enjoyed on 12/19/15 out of a 16 oz tallboy that I'm pretty sure was canned on 11/26, if memory serves. Poured into a IPA-friendly Speigelau glass.
Appearance (4.25) - Like so many of Tree House's IPAs, this one radiates from the glass, with the healthy dose of particulate reflecting all the light. It's an inverse black hole. Green glows a bright orange marigold that serves to complement the vibrant lime green of the can. The body goes well beyond being simply cloudy and can only be described as turbid, with the marigold hue persisting throughout--no variance in the color whatsoever. The head is high and tight, growing to a massive four fingers of foam consisting of tons of creamy microbubbles that begin to expand and burst as I let it sit. After some time, the head has dissipated to massive swaths of lace on the sides of the glass and a persistent pillow of bubbles across the surface of the liquid.
Smell (4.5) - To be honest, it's hard not to compare this one to the other offerings from Tree House, but I don't think that's completely fair given how much of it boils down to personal preference. I will say this: it may be the name of the beer playing mind tricks on me, but there is definitely a fresh, green element to the nose like what you expect from wet-hopped beers. It goes beyond being just hoppy and into the realm of walking through a corridor of hop bines right after a light rain. The characteristic fruit notes are certainly present--orange zest and light pineapple--but they serve to partner with the fresh, almost vegetal undercurrent.
Taste (4.5) - It's a little difficult to dock this one on taste, because I'd pick it over probably 95% of the IPAs that I could easily go grab off the shelves right now. But I have to admit being a little let down that the wonderful impression of fresh hops that I perceived in the aroma aren't quite as present in the taste. Here, the primary players are the fruity pineapple and citrus zest, but it lacks the herbal complexity that I love so much about Julius. Still, there is a nice bit of baby green bitterness on the finish that reminds you that Green is, ultimately, still a beer and not fruit juice. As with the nose, the malt presence that I know is required to create a beer is non-existent--it's present in the same way a water cracker might be used to carry an overwhelmingly flavorful salami and sharp cheddar--you need the cracker, but all you taste is the meat and cheese.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Medium bodied and moderately carbonated in a way that presents a juicy mouthfeel that has a creamy twinge to it. Finish is dry.
Overall (4.5), another outstanding offering from Tree House and definitely one of the breweries has certainly earned its hype--especially on the hoppy beer front. I do wish that they could ramp up production and distribution to make it easier to get, but it's hard not to wonder if with that ramping up, do they lose part of what makes their beer so great. Unlike many IPAs, I've yet to drink any Tree House that was older than one month, and that kind of freshness will certainly have an influence on quality. 3,295 charactersLambicPentameter, Dec 28, 2015

A: Cloudy orange body under two fingers of dense off-white foam. Good retention and clingy lace. Excellent.
S: Luscious hop extravaganza. Dankly herbaceous and brightly tropical at the same time. Wave after wave of hops, with each inhalation bringing a new aroma. Splendid.
T: Follows the nose, with a beautiful balance of fruitiness (pineapple, mango, grapefruit) and dankness (more straight hop-leaf than pine). The hops carry right through the mid-palate, and the finish is fruity, mildly bitter, and just a hint chalky - the beer's only flaw. Incredibly delicious.
M: Soft carbonation, medium body, and lots of resinous stickiness. Intense, and great.
O: Definitely up there with my favorite IPAs. I think I prefer Julius and Alter Ego, but I'd have to have them all side-by-side to be sure.

Juice tropical fruit, pineapple, and orange, followed by a bit of piney dankness and just the right amount of bitterness on the finish. And the creamy feel is just perfect for me.

4.33/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Pale orange in color, dense haze, tons of lacing, and  a three finger tall fluffy/pillowy head.
Aroma- Intense aroma of citrus, sweet oranges, pineapple, and biscuit malts.
Taste- Follows the nose closely with sweet oranges and juicy citrus upfront which comes with a soft mouthfeel.  Towards the middle pineapple shows up and adds a hit of acidic bitterness, but that quickly fades back to the soft juicy flavors and feel along with a mildy bready malt that helps balance the sweetness.
Feel- Medium bodied, medium carbonation, soft, minimal bitterness, and super easy to to drink.
Overall- This is pretty much has everything you'd want for this type of ipa: juicy hops, soft body, and minimal bitterness.  My only knock would be that sometimes the flavor gets muddled from what I assume is the yeast/sediment.Other than that its an excellent ipa, a unique ipa, and while not the end all be all of ipas (as hype has it for NE ipas) its well worth seeking out. 976 charactersCTbrew32, Dec 23, 2015

Pours beautiful hazy gold with a nice solid white head. Tropic fruit with prominent mango at the nose with perhaps some light honey, dank grass, and lemon zest in the backdrop. Amazingly balanced. The flavors bang out juicy citrus which I love to discover in any IPA or DIPAs - pineapple, mango, grapefruit, the whole shebang along with some mild bitterness. Additionally, there was that surprise caramel element to it. Very clean beer here and medium to thick mouthfeel which is amazing for the style. Just to show that there is more to the beer industry than Heady or others that just drive us mad into the hype sucking marketing machine. Beautiful beer and one I will definitely seek any day and any time. 782 charactersCuriousMonk, Dec 18, 2015

The first thing that hits is a juicy smell, but when I'm done filling the glass there's an amazing sticky dankness that frankly made me start salivating. There's a cannabis (the good stuff) scent as well. Color is hazy light orange/maple wood color, nice head but not overwhelming. taste is mango papaya goodness with a creamy mouthfeel and piney bitter goodness in the aftertaste. I feel the beer's finish working through my palate, and adding a tingly weed-like awesomeness to my sinuses while my tongue has a luscious coating of green goodness picking up sweet sticky flavors on the finish.

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First perfect score I've ever given an IPA. I just think it's absolutely flawless from the time you pop it open until the very last drop.
Pours super cloudy, with a beautiful yellowish / orange hue. First aroma is a ton of what I'm guessing is a Mix of Galaxy and Citra (maybe Amarillo too?) followed by that typical Treehouse yeast. First taste explodes over your tastebuds. And it never falls off. Full, refreshing and clean. Perfection.
Watch out, this one will ruin all other IPA's for you. 496 charactersBrentLepping, Dec 11, 2015

A: The beer is a cloudy yellowish gold color, with a large foamy off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a very thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is an excellent combination of strong floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with a strong burst of piney hops bitterness. Then some sweet flavors of fruity citrus and some caramel come in. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and provides a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent IPA to drink for a long time. 877 charactersTheManiacalOne, Dec 02, 2015

Held up to the light, this is a divine kiss of inspiration, and I immediately started reciting poetic verse, backwards. I also inexplicably started doing jumping jacks. 
S: pretty subdued. Getting a lot of creaminess, orange bouquet, lemon peel. A warm night in Marrakesh, basically. Alternatively see: Jerusalem spring at sunset. 
T: this made me seriously question the reality of my existence, sending me into paroxysms of Truman-show-level existential crisis. How can a BEER taste like THIS?! Cold, it tastes like an improved version of grapefruit juice--with the same mouthfeel, but a more harmonious balance between sour and sweet. As it warms I get orange creamsicle, tangerine zest, some pulpy pineapple. Nary a sign of booze. 
F: cream. 
O: this is tops. I think it trumps Julius. Tree House clearly has a style that is utterly unique, making it hard to compare to any of its other New England ilk. Don't walk, run. 1,006 charactersNizzleEGizzle, Nov 30, 2015

As with all the Tree House beers I've had so far, this is hazy with a dense white head with decent retention and lacing. The nose also has the typical TH character - sweet and messy hop juice on a gritty, hop particulate heavy texture. Aromas of fruit - pineapple, pulpy peach and mango, are present. Malt character is minimal, though a sugary sweetness is present. The palate opens with a blend of sugary sweetness and plenty of hop flavor. Fruity pineapple, pulpy orange juice, pulpy peach juice, pulpy mango juice (you get the idea...) are all present. Sweet on the mid-palate with some honey and simple syrup, this beer finishes with a weird chlorophyll-like astringency that's rather unpleasant. Enjoyable fruity flavors are also present, though. Chewy, pulpy, gritty, this is a little disappointing on the palate. The high level of fine carbonation only amplifies the texture. Messy. 957 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 29, 2015

So fruity with pineapple, oranges, mango and stone fruit! This is what air fresheners need to be! The body is extremely juicy and drinkable. Could go through can after can of this stuff. There is a restrained bitterness in the finish that balances the beer out perfectly. Perfection. 391 charactersW_Des, Nov 25, 2015

One inch white head, tight bubbles.  Slightly creamy.
Very cloudy/hazy.  Looks like i poured a big glass of fruit juice.  
Has hints of pineapple.  Exotic/tropical fruit scents.
Tastes like pineapple/orange zest, and a bit of grapefruit.
Very good palate feel, medium.. has body.
Surprised by the lacing, very good.
Amazing IPA.
No alcohol in taste whatsoever. 391 characterskalosjakar, Nov 24, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look - Looks like mango/pineapple juice in the glass. That killer signature TH look. Haze for days!
Smell - The aroma that comes out of the glass is unbelievable! A complete tropical juice bomb. Pineapples, mangos, tangerines, and limes with a slight dankness underneath all those glorious tropical fruits. 
Taste - A heavenly hop assault on the palate. Insanely tropical, citrusy, herbaceous with some piney/pithy/rind bitterness on the back end. 
Feel - Smooth, creamy and mouth coating. No clue where the 7.6% is.....
Overall - Completely blown away by this one. Ranks up there as one of my favorites....if not my favorite! Was a pleasure drinking this from start...to finish. 680 charactersTonyjenlasc, Nov 23, 2015

A: Among the cloudiest IPAs I have ever seen (seems to be a trademark with Tree House) - hazy and cloudy... high turbidity, to put it scientifically - golden orange in color, more or less looks like an extra pulpy orange juice - pours with a medium white head that fades to a small, creamy white cap - leaves some nice streaks of lacing
S: Massively juicy and leafy - big, bright citrus notes, with orange, tangerine, and grapefruit flesh and oily pith -  tropical notes, mango and fresh pineapple - big amount of herbal, leafy, and spicy hops as well - prickly and sappy pine, mint, and a touch of green onions, maybe chives - hints of white wine - resinous - floral and spicy, definite Australian hops (a touch of Ella, perhaps?) - lightly sweet and doughy malts
T: Borderline punishing, which is truly impressive - this is a hop puree - juicy, leafy, floral, and spicy - juicy and fleshy orange and grapefruit - citrus zest and rind in abundance - tropical as well, with pineapple, mango, and passion fruit - white wine - leafy, herbal, dank, and spicy - loads of sticky pine, mint, and some green onions - yup, fruits and vegetables - malts have a moderate amount of sweetness, with some light bread and bread dough, maybe a touch of honey - some light dryness in the finish
M: Medium body, very smooth, fuzzy, and creamy (again, it's a hop puree), lightly sticky, but there is some dryness - low carbonation
O: It ain't easy
This beer is insane. I've reviewed over 1000 beers on this site, and I'm struggling to make sense of Green. I should also note that this is my second can. The amount of hops involved in the creation of this beer must be truly astronomical. This should be absolute chaos, but it somehow works. It's not my favorite from Tree House, but it's beyond memorable. I may have more to say after can #3. 1,848 charactersangrybabboon, Nov 19, 2015

I've been chasing this for some time after having Julius for the first time earlier this year, and I think it's better than Julius, so juicy and dank, looks like a double dry hopped beer, and drinks so smooth. Worth seeking out. 356 characterstroupos40, Nov 18, 2015

T: This is pretty great. Lots of citrus while never getting too sweet at all. Green papaya, orange, tangerine and grapefruit pith, a smooth pink grapefruit middle and a finish that leaves just a kiss of bitterness. A very delicious IPA. Digging it. 514 charactersnotchucknorris, Nov 13, 2015

4.73/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 7 day old 750ml swing top bottled at 7.5% ABV. One of the most remarkable aromatic experiences I've ever had with any beer, not just IPAs.  Tree House seems to have made a deal with the devil in order to hit one home run after another. The sweet orange and pineapple aroma is off the charts good. 
As hazy as they come in the glass. I don't know if the canned version is this rich in appearance but I absolutely love unfiltered IPAs so I was on cloud nine. Flavors are citrus dominant, perfectly drinkable and bitterness is just totally on point. Alcohol is hidden well, as in you don't even notice its there. Unbelievable lacing, and head formation/retention is the best I've ever seen in an IPA bar none.
Very creamy mouthfeel, between the pulp-like haziness and explosive fleshy orange qualities. I could drink this forever. I don't know if its coming across that I like this beer but just in case, it's really an incredible drinking experience. 964 charactersdd43, Nov 07, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Got this in a trade. The hype is real with Tree House. They arguably make the best hoppy beers in the country right now. And many beer geeks would argue that they make the best stouts as well. All this with only being about four years old as a brewery.
With that said, this MIGHT be the best IPA I've ever had. I liked it better than Julius (even though that has the perfect score here on BA and Green only has a 99). I guess to each their own.
The look is beautiful in a glass. Hazy, opaque, bright tangerine color. So NE style.
The smell is truly glorious. So fruity. Pineapple, oranges, orange cream soda even. How does Tree House achieve this? Pure magic.
The taste is so smooth. Fluffy, even. Creamy mouthfeel, almost milk-stout like. Crazy for an IPA.  Pineapple, orange, orange sorbet, orange cream soda. Tree House also has this unique, bubble gum like flavor that is so unique and special. There's a medium bitterness on the back end with a nice hoppy, herbaceous, fresh greens taste (hence the name of the beer, I'm guessing). Don't let the name fool you, though. This beer is a massive tropical fruit bomb. 
Overall, this beer is a 100/100. 1,156 charactersstarclassic21, Nov 06, 2015

Appearance: Orangy-yellow and hazy as can be, with a puffy white head. Leaves tons of spotty lacing on the glass, along with tons of lingering retention on the head.
Aroma: loads of citrus, with a slight edge in bitterness over Julius. I get a lot of ripe peach here too.
Taste: Begins with some soft peach and mango flavors, and subsequently evolves into pineapple and some citrusy flavors. Finishes with medium bitterness, and leaves a really long-lasting smoothie type flavor on the tongue. So so good.
Feel: Medium body, with a creamy and smooth feel. Not very sticky, but leaves plenty of flavor on the palate.
Overall: an excellent, delicious IPA. I'd drink it again and again. And again. Another fantastic brew from Treehouse. 830 charactersTheElectricOne, Nov 03, 2015

Tropical fruity aroma. Taste is full of tropical fruit and hint of grass at the end.  Pineapple and orange dominate, some peach. Wow this is tasty. Citrus peel and grassy bitterness just at the right level. Nice dry finish. Very soft full mouthfeel. Top notch IPA! 364 charactersNolaHopHead, Nov 03, 2015

This one pours a turbid, chunky looking vivid orange, with a half inch head, and a good amount of lacing.
Smells like orange juice, peach, melon, grapefruit, and some fresh cut grass.
This is a super intense, hop-forward beer. It feels like I'm drinking straight hops, right off the vine. It's got a fairly thick taste to it, almost feels like hop particulates are still in the beer. Huge amounts of orange, pineapple, melon, and grapefruit, with super bitter pine and freshly mowed grass. No malt character at all. I love Galaxy hops.
This is fairly thick bodied for an IPA, super turbid mouthfeel, with a lower level of carbonation.
This beer is definitely super green. It's also super tasty, and one of the best IPA's I've ever had. 768 charactersGreesyFizeek, Oct 28, 2015

L - Pour reveals a muddy, burnt orange appearance with moderate head and lacing.
S - Smells strongly of citrus fruit. Grapefruit specifically. Nice.
T- Taste follows the nose. Big time grapefruit. Bitter. Really bitter. Reminds me a lot of a west coast IIPA. If you like hops, these will melt your face. Not overly balanced which is my one complaint. Alcohol is present too.
F- A sipper due to the hops and alcohol, which even at only 7.6%, is present.
O - A good IIPA. If you're a hop head, you'll probably very much enjoy. For me, it's a bit one dimensional. 587 charactersZaximus, Oct 25, 2015

4.88/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 16 oz can into a Tree House snifter. 
Pours a murky, bright golden orange color with a large fluffy off-white head. Leaves a f*ckton of lacing and the head sticks around for a while. 
The smell is a bit more subtle than expected, but still extremely pleasant. There are tons of notes of pineapple, as well as some orange rind, and basil. Has a soft bubblegum note on the finish. 
The taste is very tropical, with notes of grapefruit, melon, and a surprising amount of pineapple. Sweet up front and bitter on the end. Not getting a lot of malt flavor on this one but the hop flavors are fantastic and more than make up for the seeming lack of balance. 
The mouthfeel tho. Holy crap. This is an unbelievable amount of creaminess and smoothness. Has just enough hop bite at the end to let you know you're a man and you need to go change your oil and cut down that tree in the yard. Quite possibly the best feel I've ever had in any beer ever, and that's saying a lot. 
Overall, not my favorite beer from Tree House but it's right up there. This one is a bit more bitter than some of its counterparts, but still retains that juicy, tropical sweetness that makes TH IPA's so great. 1,195 charactersScaryEd, Oct 18, 2015

Nose is that of cantaloupe and peach with green herbaceous quality. Taste resembles the same with an addition of orange and pineapple dancing around finishes with a soft bitterness. Orange sorbet is spot on with this one mouthfeel is just as creamy as I remember it being. Thank Goodness for green! 403 charactersPapaSwaguilar3, Oct 17, 2015

S: Pineapple, kiwi, melon, cut grass. Orange pulp. Green and leafy. Cracker and dough malt base.
T: Melon rind and kiwi. Gritty, green, earthy, leafy, and dank bud hop tastes build. Juiced orange flavors eventually come to dominate all of these. Bitterness is stiff and builds front to back. It hits its apex with a puckering burst of citrus rind. Cracker and dough malt base underneath. Green and oily hop flavors close things out on the finish.
M: medium bodied. Fluffy and creamy feel. Sharp, fine-bubbled carbonation cuts through the body.
O: It ain't pretty to look at, but nobody will complain once they taste it. Sip after sip it grows on you, and before you even realize it you're in love. 874 charactersryan1788a5, Sep 30, 2015

4.5/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Getting its name from the tinge of green that had shown through the late stages of the brewing process, Tree House resists shying away from those heavy hopping rates, staying true to the beer's roots and now gracing the tastebuds of New England hop-heads with unabashed apology.
But not quite that compost-green color, but the beer's viscous haze ebbs and flows into the glass taking instead the appearance of grapefruit and orange juices- perhaps with extra pulp. As its seductively creamy head builds, its juicy, tantalizing and irresistible fruit aromas spring forth with the vibrancy of exotic citrus and tropical fruit punch- but however with its own curious herbaceous bouquet. Creamy, surly and tangy in taste, the fructose-laden initial taste offers a fruity tartness that evokes teeth-churning behavior in the very first sip.
And as the taste blossoms across the middle palate, its secrets reveal, layer by layer. Fruity sweetness begins to drift while the tropical fruits rise to the forefront- first the pineapple, mango, apricot and passionfruit. With full hoppy saturation mounting on the tastebuds, the acidity of ripe tangerine, lemon, lime and gooseberry turn to a dry sherbet flavor for complexity and charm. Not to be outdone, the throat-gripping bitterness is smooth albeit sharply acidic with an undertow of chive, fresh grass clippings, shallot and cannabis.
Working both the creamy and dry segments in mouthfeel, the beer remains juicy while trending crisp, clean and oh-so deeply resinous. Finishing with a sappy pine flavor, the beer's overwhelming hop complexity completely seduces the palate and easily makes the palate forget about the preferred bone-dry character that world class IPA should garner. Green does this anyway. 1,754 charactersBEERchitect, Sep 08, 2015

A - The same bright, hazy orange as the rest.  You know, maybe this one is a bit of a darker orange, and doesn't brighten up the room as much.  The tight off-white head is still lovely and not really moving.
N - Ooo, tons of juicy, bitter hops.  This is much more complex than the Haze I had last night.  Peaches, apricots, pine, a little bit of citrus.  Plenty going on here.
T - There's just something about Australian hops that strikes me the wrong way.  I mean the taste here is an explosion of flavor; this is a truly impressive beer.  It's just not MY preference for an IPA.  There's just that certain something I get from Nelson hops that I can't describe.  Ah well.  This is extremely dank and piney.
M - TH really nails this every time.  I'm sipping a liquid, and then all of a sudden it's a gas.  Like M&Ms, this melts in your mouth, except it's a different part of the phase diagram.
O - Not my favorite flavors in an IPA, but definitely a well-crafted brew. 1,061 charactersCraftFan5, Sep 04, 2015

Aroma really pops with bright citrus, like juice from a freshly peeled orange. Also get pineapple, grapefruit, guava, papaya, and lime. Taste reveals a hop bomb. Not much malt at all. It has a bright lemon-lime kick with peach and stone fruit on the front end and grapefruit pith on the finish. There's pineapple too. This is really fruity as it warms without getting too sweet. Hops really shine through from start to finish. The mouth feel is medium to full, coating the mouth with hops, yet it remains crisp and pops with lively carb. World class IPA. 639 charactersdanh53, Sep 02, 2015

Again find myself scratching my head as to how these guys produce beers of this quality over and over again.

Look - Golden, Hazy with a slight orange hue.
Smell - IPA HEAVEN! Citrus with a little tropical fruit and tons of dank pine.
Taste - Hop Nirvana! Tons of fresh citrus, more specifically juicy grapefruit accompanied by bitter piny hops. A true hop lovers IPA, a beer with no restraint very bold and very delicious.
Feel - Nice carbonation, mouth covered with bitter hops leaving my lips smacking for more. Not for the faint of heart. For those that appreciate this style, Green is a World Class beer - my new favorite beer (period).
Overall - World Class. It doesn't get any better for a hop lover - I highly recommend this beer to any/all hop lovers. 699 charactersMatthewHopHead, Aug 18, 2015

A lot of Tree House fans seem to hold this one above Julius, and I believe they're right. Enjoyed a 16oz pour on tap at the 11th Annual Hophead Throwdown. This beer is super fruity, dank, and even has a bubblegum-like sweetness. Super smooth mouthfeel makes this beer disturbingly drinkable. Loved it. 350 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Aug 15, 2015
3.95/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Pour is cloudy light orange with a good bit of tight off white head, solid retention. Nose is heavily hopped, has a light grain backbone, tons of bitter grapefruit, lots of citrus, gets almost plastic like aroma its so hopped and has that musky rind their others have had. Full bodied, well carbonated, very silky on the tongue, high bitterness through the very dry finish.  Flavor is super hopped, citrus, tons of bitter grapefruit, almost overly bitter. 455 characterscpetrone84, Aug 15, 2015

4.5/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a can two weeks old into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Turbid orange to tan. Kind of a peachy color.
Aroma: Tropical fruit (grapefruit, pineapple), peach, and a little cut grass. Smells like juice.
Taste: Follows the nose. Right upfront you get juice: pineapple, peach, and grapefruit. This is followed by some pine, grass, and bitterness. There is also a slight alcohol fummyness. The finish is bitter with some mild fruit notes coming back (I'm getting the peach again). 
Feel: Great mouth feel. Bready and it leaves you smacking your lips for more.
Overall is this a great IPA right there in contention with TH Julius. 630 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Aug 14, 2015

Thanks to marino13412 for the awesome trade.
This one tastes like a great balance between east coast/west coast IPA. Super juicy and creamy maltiness with a grassy, zesty hop profile and a bittering finish. The finish was a little to bitter and salty for my taste. 
Overall, preferred this one over Haze and Julius (both are still excellent). This is the beer I'll be most looking forward to if and when I'm headed to MA. 504 charactersRollzroyce21, Aug 14, 2015

L: Cloudy, light orange pour with a solid head.
S: Smells like a bag of fresh hops. Holy cow. Pine, citrus, a hint of tropical fruit (pineapple), along with freshly cut grass.
T: Great complexity of flavor. Pine and slight floral notes on the open, followed quickly by hits of tangerine, pineapple, and resin. Like drinking a hop smoothie.
F: Light and creamy, especially for the flavors.
O: An impressive IPA from Tree House; it's easy to tell that this is loaded with hops. Where many IPAs taste like a hoppy beer, this tastes like pure hops using the beer as a delivery vessel. Looking forward to trying some of their other offerings. 673 charactersRistaccia, Aug 14, 2015

First couple of sips had a surprisingly bitter taste at the mid-palate and on the back end, but this bitterness almost completely disappeared just a couple of minutes later.  Moving forward after the first couple of sips, just five minutes later this beer completely smoothed out almost entirely, and just became another great, crisp and smooth IPA from Tree House.  Gives Julius a run for its money, no question about it... 535 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Jul 29, 2015

S: Hop bomb, tons of piney, resiny smell, with some citrus and fruit on the back
T: Just like the nose. Holy mother of hops. You get a real nice dank, hoppy, piney, resin taste at first. Then some fruits/citrus on the mid, then the end is right back to hops with a nice semi bitter finish and some hop oil.
F: Slight downside i felt it was a little to thin. Looking at it and its cloudy and lacing i  wanted it to be a little thicker. But perfect carbonation and that perfect resin oil sticks to your toungue.
O: Another amazing beer from tree house, I think it's there more bitter IPA with a good bite to it 682 charactersGinjaSlice, Jul 26, 2015

It's fruity, smooth, and mild.  Does not betray it relatively high ABV.
Smells lightly peaty with large nodes of tangerine.  Tastes bready and yeasty up front, juicy tropical fruits in the back.  Very nice, but not noticeably nicer than tropical-hopped beers being produced by a dozen other brewers in the state. 392 charactersmynie, Jul 25, 2015

A=Straw but slight orange hue, super hazy, glowing, thick frothy white head, lacing that won't quit.
S=Hops, Hops, Hops, so much fresh hops, makes my nose feel moist with hop oil (all of this is good IMO)  Citrus and pine are most noticeable with a dank and resinous follow through. 
T=The flavor of fresh hops is strong with this one.  Citrus and grass, resinous, dankness, pine.  Super strong hop flavors but surprisingly balanced and not overpowering.  A bitterness keeps trying to overpower you, but it never did, must have enough malt backing to keep it smooth.
M=Moderate level of carbonation with a full bodied presence. 
O=After trying Julius (Tree House) earlier in the week for the first time, IMO this is superior.  They are both great world-class IPA's but this one had some real pop in flavor and aroma that I found irresistible. 900 charactersjhavs, Jul 24, 2015

Smells of delicious citrus and juice with some subtle pine, sticky hops.  Taste is a splash of fruit juice, orange, very bright followed by bitter.  Very crisp and refreshing.  Finish is dry and peppery. Mouthfeel is frothy and pillowy, perhaps only slightly on the light side. The first sip of this beer is really like a blast of fresh tropical air.  This is really an exceptional IPA.  Easy to drink, and wonderful color, smell, and flavor.  This beer is so good that it deserves to be sought after on its own. 571 charactersanteatr23, Jul 04, 2015

4.02/5  rDev -12%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 416oz can from Steve000 (thanks man). No canning info. Served in a goblet. 
Pours a deep, opaque orange amber with almost two fingers of white froth on top. The head gradually fades to a surface haze and a thick ring around the edge that leaves copious lace. It's a hazy mess with glorious lace. 
Aromas are incredibly juicy. Orange juice, peach, pineapple and an almost honey-like sweetness. 
Flavors are danker than the nose forecasted. Over ripe orange, peach purée, faint garlic, hints of pine, mild bready malt and traces of alcohol. This is a smooth, easy drinking IPA with a great blend of hop flavors. 
Medium body with moderate carbonation. Nice bitter notes in the finish with a good bit of citrus pulp and slightly tropical with some dank hops creeping in. 
Green is the second tasty IPA offering I've had from Tree House and it seems to be a style they do well. This comes from the school of IPAs that understands flavor is more important than appearance. Green is some good stuff that I'd happily drink again. 1,027 charactersThickNStout, May 26, 2015

Hazy, cloudy yellow body with an orange hue, two finger white head, lots of lacing, good retention. Smells of tropical fruit, spices, oranges, a bit of grapefruit. Mild resin, nice mellow caramel. Flavour is moderately juicy tropical fruit, orange, grapefruit, even a bit of pine, pale malt caramel sweetness, moderately bitter grapefruit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, soft, good carbonation, easy to drink, bitter but pleasantly so. Overall, a very good IPA from Treehouse that is one of their better beers overall. 553 charactersStevedore, May 18, 2015

T: Similar to nose with a strong taste of melons.
M: Extremely balanced with a mild hop kick combined with malty sweetness. Almost no bitterness or dryness.

A - Pours completely opaque.  Almost looks like blended fruit juice in a glass.  Incredible.
S - The best nose on a beer I've ever smelled.  Explosive juiciness, grapefruit, oranges, there is an awesome herbaceous note (think fresh cut basil).  Bubble gum is there (think Fruit Stripe from the 80s) too.  Awesome.
T - Mind blowing.  The creamiest IPA I've ever had.  The mouth feel is ridiculous.  I've never had a beer like this.  Crazy citrus, passion fruit.  Intense.  Oranges, grapefruit peel, orange pith, pineapple.  Awesome bitterness middle of the mouth, but that sweet fruit juice comes back on the back end to make it stupid balanced.   Dry finish.
O - This is hands down the best IPA I have ever had.  For me, it doesn't get better.  I need more Tree House beers.  This beer blew my mind. 867 charactersjow_42, May 01, 2015

We had the Sap right before this and we've moved on to the Green. Amber in color and so cloudy that you can't see your fingers on the other side. Aroma is awesome, the kind that keeps you going back to smell the beer more often than you actually drink it. Tons of pineapple, orange citrus, and tropical fruits. Medium bodied despite the somewhat strong ABV. So smooth, juicy, and delicious. A stellar IPA from Tree House! 514 charactersJacobob10, Apr 15, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16 oz can into a Tree House tulip glass. Purchased at the brewery 2 days ago.  
Pours a raw, super unfiltered hazy honey colored body with a 1 finger white head that reduces to a ring of foam, leaving spotty lacing. 
Aromas of citrus, tropical fruit, fresh hops, juicy fruit, pineapple, some butter in the background. 
On the tongue it's slightly sweet upfront, citrus and pine  on the follow through, with a super fresh hoppy zing on the finish, kind of piney/resinous. Not very bitter on the aftertaste, super smooth with medium body and carbonation. 
Very good IPA, drinking it fresh was amazing, it's very raw, fresh, and hoppy. 650 charactersgcamparone, Mar 22, 2015
4.1/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4In talking to many of the Tree House faithful, Green gets mentioned in the "favorite beer" conversation quite often, edging out even Julius on multiple occasions.
My experience, however, spanning three batches over 2015, points to a different beer, one that lands in the "good" but not quite "great" category, with something missing in the ingredients to elevate it to an elite beer status. 
The good news is that Green has become my beer to share with others. 462 charactersrodmanfor3, Mar 21, 2015

Appearance - Looks like freshly poured juice, hazy golden yellow color with dense white foam.
Flavor - Border-line fruit beer.  Love the juicy tropical fruits in here--maybe some guava as well?  A bit of a green onion hoppiness, but only as it warms up.
Mouthfeel - As thick as a lighter stout.  Super creamy and no prickly carbonation.
Overall - West coast IPA bomb of fruit flavors.  Drink this with an umbrella. 525 charactersadnauseam007, Mar 17, 2015

Pours yellow and hazy, 1 finger of fluffy white head. 
The smell is packed with tropical fruits and a very light cracker-like breadiness.
Taste follows much the same, citrus fruits and succulent sweetness balanced beautifully by a strong hop bite. There is some of the onion-like flavor you find from Simcoe, I think, but it mellows nicely over time. 
Medium mouthfeel, exactly as one would expect. Nearly sour residues coat your tongue on the back end and makes you enjoy the time in between sips almost as much as drinking it! 
Overall, a juicy, delicious IPA, another huge win for Tree House 619 charactersrebel-fist, Mar 02, 2015

Smell: very juicy hop aroma.  lots of citrus ranging from tangerine to orange and grapefruit. tropical fruits including papaya, mango and cantaloupe. light malts, may some lemon bread or biscuit like sweetness.
Taste: opens with huge tropical fruit taste. melon and cantaloupe, mango and papaya. citrus fruits come in next with orange, a small amount of grapefruit and some lime. malts are very subdued. possibly some lemon bread, some light biscuity sweetness. finishes with just a little bit of hop resin.
Mouthfeel: nice light and refreshing. a little bit of dryness. bitterness is initially moderate to strong but a small amount of sweetness comes through towards the end. slight lingering bitter. 
Overall: this one is a super juicy hazy and tasty ipa. just the way I like them. great hop flavor without being overly bitter. 1,017 charactersSportsandJorts, Feb 07, 2015

4.64/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Second or third time around with this one thanks to generous friends sharing it in the past. Filled 9 days ago and kept in a very cold fridge since.
A- 750ml swing-top opens with a small pop and in TH style it is filled to the absolute brim. A murky golden apricot bodied ale pours to my tulip promoting a one finger creamy white cap. Good head retention and tons of lace in the form of sheets.
S- Fruit nectar aromas blast out of the glass with citrus and tropical varietals leading the way to some stone fruits. Juicy tangerines, melons, mangoes, grapefruits, cantaloupes and oranges come to mind. More juice in the citrus elements rather than zest. Malts and yeast reside but are hardly worth mentioning, light and clean.
T- Some shifting in the hop character overall but most of the same key players from the aroma carry over here beautifully. The bitterness accentuates some pine and herbal tones but the main show is still the citrus, which now has a bit of zesty pith to it, and tropical fruits. Orange juice, grapefruits, papaya, mango, apricot, slight passion fruit, dank mint and ripe cantaloupes and melons.
MF- Light-medium bodied, closer to the latter with a creamy and silky smooth consistency on the palate. Carbonation on the high side adding a bite that promotes the fresh, clean hops. Finishes with a moderate bitterness.
No particular reason in saying it here but perhaps the high quality, bold flavors of this beer did something to my subconscious: I have probably reviewed hundreds of IPAs now but I never get sick of it. Particular things I love about this one is the mixture of a fairly aggressive bitterness with smooth, juicy fruit nectar flavors. It brings the citrus bitterness along for the ride with the fruit pulp. Tree House is world class once again. 1,787 characterscbutova, Feb 01, 2015

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy yellow orange color with no vision of anything 
Smell:  Juicy hop aroma.  Tropical, citrus, lemon, herbal, pungent, grassy, and floral hops followed by caramel, toasted, and bready malts.
Taste:  As good as it smells.  Balanced and mild bitterness in the rear.  Really juicy and delicious hop flavor.  
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, a little chewy, and mild tingly bitterness.
Overall:  Nice juicy hop bomb.  Might not look to pleasing due to bring somewhat hazy, but don't be misled by the view.  Tasty and delicious. 682 charactersFlounder57, Jan 26, 2015

T - delicious citrus and fruit flavors come through with some of the onion, only slightly bitter on finish

First THB glass pours with a 1/2" off-white head, over the cloudy burnished gold brew. Head deflates slowly, with leggy lasting lace. Aroma is citrus and pine. 
Taste starts sweet, promptly overpowered by citrus and pine, which power through the close, with moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is super soft and smooth, and drinkability is easy.   Another nice one. 413 charactersppoitras, Dec 06, 2014

Love the murky look (I know others knock that). 
The aroma is off the hook. Pure pineapple. Some slightly sweet malty breadiness behind it. 
Flavor follows suit with pineapple, melon, grapefruit, and a touch of onion on the extreme finish. The taste of onion or chive does become more prominent as you finish it but it's not a deterent. 
Mouthfeel is silky smooth. 
Just fantastic. Might be my favorite IPA right now. 499 charactersjbertsch, Nov 10, 2014

The beer comes in a hazy deep gold, pale amber color. Completely hazy. A sexy beer.
The aroma is orange sorbet for days, pineapple, hints of Juicy Fruit, passionfruit, dough malt, orange zest, bright pine air freshener.
The flavor follows with as described, tangerine, orange sorbet, citrus candy, pineapple, yellow grapefruit. Waves of doughy malts and a creamy mouthfeel. Then onto an herbaceous bitterness, green vegetables of escarole and kale.
Up there with In Perpetuity as the Best Tree House IPA, and possibly the best IPA ever.
The beer comes in a completely opaque peach color. A very unique and beautiful brew.
The aroma smacks of Juicy Fruit, pear juice, citrus peel, pineapple, lots of citrus and tropical candy/gum aromas.
The flavor follows with that Juicy Fruit gum, pear flavor. More orange, tangerine. Lots of doughy yeast flavor. There's a drying with some pine and herbal/tea bitterness on the back end.
This beer explodes out of the glass with intriguing hop flavor, a perfect malt bill and mouthfeel, and bitterness to balance the brew out. It beats Julius and is up there with Susan as best IPAs. 1,144 charactersdar482, Oct 14, 2014

Moderate head formation to start drops to a wispy cap, chunky loose collar, and lacing for days. Super sticky notches and ropes of lacing.
Smell: Tangerine. Skin, juice, oil, and zest. It's all there. Deep citrus with some solid grapefruit elements as well. Solid push of bitter and oily pine with some backing tropical elements. Pushes peach and mango as well. Hyper fruity with enough of a backing bitter edge to keep it in check. Malts are nicely sweet with a touch of caramelization and a solid bready component. Solid push of pineapple as well. Super tropical with a huge bitterness. Some lime and fresh-baked bread.
Taste: Bitterness rides the front with a solid push of tropical hops. Pineapple in abundance as it warms with some solid peach and tangerine as well. Malt backbone runs decidedly bready with a touch of caramelized malt sweetness. Some raw hop leaf with some aggressive pellet thrown in as well. Ever so slightly dank. A ton of orange and grapefruit flesh. Absolutely loaded with tropical hop. Obliterated and blended in to a hop smoothie. Some fresh bread flavors as well. Pithy bitterness coupled with a solid sticky and oily pine resin. Fresh orange juice. A touch of lime juice in the back as well. 
Mouthfeel: Creamy initial sip on a medium body. Slight astringency with a moderate carbonation. Slightly dry on the finish.
Overall: Quite the young whipper snapper.
This beer is insane when it's fresh and drops off a bit after a few weeks but never falls apart. It's aggressive and assertive and pushes the boundary of acceptable hop flavor. With all that said, it's damn good and one of my favorites from Tree House. 1,748 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Sep 14, 2014
4.5/5  rDev -1.5%Sept. 13 dated 750ml growler poured into a Tree House tulip. 
Appearance: Pineapple juice golden. Small, fast diminishing snowy white head.
Smell: Made-from-scratch bread dough; lemon-lime, hints of tangerine. 
Taste: Citrusy, doughy goodness. Tangerine and and a sharp, but comforting bitterness equally attack the palate. Pure un-squeezed orange juice on the back end, along with a convenient lingering bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Medium body. Perfect amount of carbonation. Highly down-able, but fragile enough to sip.
Overall: Only my second time to Tree House --in two weeks. Being an hour and twenty away, the brews & atmosphere are insanely worth it. The four brews I've had all live up to the already-set high expectations. A beautiful, elegant American IPA. 767 charactersBelimo3102, Sep 14, 2014

The color is a deep yellow gold with two fingers of pillowy white head and some really nice lacing left on the glass.
The smell is fruity with a grapefruit aroma and a juicy fruit gun smell there as well. A leafy/fresh cut grass aroma tickles the nose a bit.
The taste has a sweet juicy citrus flavor that is like biting into a tangerine rubbed with hop resin. A tangy fruit flavor with a sticky bitterness that bites but levels out toward the middle let's the passion-fruit flavor and ruby red grapefruit flavor come out.
The feel of this beer is lighter then expected for a 7% IPA. The bitterness has a way of growing and a nice smoothness instead of being abrasive. The great drinkable feel of this beer is delightful and packs a whole lot of flavor into this well crafted IPA. 852 charactersDuhast500, Aug 08, 2014

t: A nice citrus flavor, moderate hop bite lingers slightly on the sides of the tongue. Sweet/tart orangy aftertaste. As it warms, and/or as I get towards the bottom of the bottle, I get a few pretty strong grassy notes that remind of Heady Topper. No kidding! But they don't linger and persist as much as Heady's do.
m: Medium to full. "Chewy" comes to mind. Body to burn, Smooth.
o: The nice fellow who filled the growler said he prefers this over Julius. I have been to Tree House twice now when Julius was supposed to be available, but because I was there on Saturday afternoons it was out both times. This was worth the trip and the money I spent though, and it's the third excellent non-Julius TH brew I have tried out of three. Great to be able to get top quality fresh in my general area. 991 charactersscotorum, May 12, 2014

Hazy blond color with all the foamy accoutrements of a fine IPA. Aroma is farm stick your nose in a bag of hops fresh peppery citrus. Very grapefruit juice flavor with more peppery, moss hop spice and a distinctive farminess not unlike Hill Farmstead beers. Dry and resinous. So good.
For what it's worth we had Green and Sap back to back and I like this a lot better. 451 charactersdonkeyrunner, Apr 20, 2014

4.89/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5L - the best looking beer I've ever seen. Hell, it's practically named after how good it looks! Beautiful turbid, murky tangerine color with an almost mystical aura surrounding it. A glowing orb of deep orange with radioactive green-hued fringes at the edges of the glass. Amazing how it conforms to any shaped glass and makes it work. Gorgeous. 
S - orange sherbet. Pineapple tangerine. Lemon. Both fresh and not-so-ripe fruits. Hit all the notes. 
T - monster juice bomb. Orange creamsicle out the ass. Doesn't even taste like beer. Oranges, pineapple juice, satsumas. Anything and everything citrus. So incredibly smooth and balanced. Hops kicked up a few notches, something Tree House doesn't do that often, giving it a nice bitter bite in the finish. Truly a spectacle to behold and as much of an adventure as possible while drinking beer.
F - liquid velvet. A soft, yet buoyant feel breathing life into every sip. 
O - might be my favorite Tree House brew. Julius is the ultimate in drinkability, but this one packs more flavor and more punch. It is so incredibly well-rounded and goddamn juicy. Very strong flavor that muscles its way to the front of the flavor line even when I've got a stuffed nose or my palate is otherwise wrecked. 1,246 charactersagreenman19, Apr 14, 2014

A - The beers pours a very hazy gold with a solid inch head that lasts for a minute or so. The lacing left behind is think and covers the whole glass and lasts for a long time as well.
S - Holy fruit punch literally, this beer has a huge nose with pineapple, mango almost a candy like sweetness to it.
T - The flavors explode on the palate, all those different fruits are dancing on the tongue, pineapple, mango, kiwi with a slight bitterness at the back of the tongue.
M - Very smooth with almost a mild bitterness, the aftertastes lingers nicely, you can still taste this beer minutes after your last sip.
O - Overall the beer is as fruity hop forward ipa as the come, if you like your ipa's to be heavy on the tropical fruits and I mean heavy then this ipa is for you cause it's sure for me. 838 charactersBoomblaze, Feb 18, 2014

The beer is a beautiful orange-copper, with (and maybe this is in my head) a subtle tinge of green in it? A little hazy. The head is creamy and leaves inconsistent buy distinct lacing on the glass.
S - Wonderful aroma of pine and tropical fruit. Just the right strength. Maybe a tiny bit of bready malt.
T - Lives up the smell! Very complex with flavors weaving in and out. There is a light, rounded bitterness that compliments that pine and tropical citrus nature of the hop flavors. Little bit of bready of biscuit flavored malt.
M - Very nice. Juicy and refreshing. Medium-full body.
O - Another fantastic addition to the Tree House family of IPAs. Can't recommend this place enough. These beers stand up against the best of all the IPAs I've had. 817 charactersAndrew041180, Nov 10, 2013

Growler &gt; Tree House Tulip
A - Pours a hazy gold with a slight orange tint 1.5 finger of white head, medium lacing.
S - Aroma is outstanding, orange, big lemon and lime juice aroma, pineapple, dank pine, biscuity and some slight caramel malt. Just lush juicy citrus and tropical fruits.
T - Massive citrus, lemon and lime juice and zest, orange juice, pineapple, mango, papaya caramel then transforms to biscuity malt. At the end you get a nice crisp dank pine bitterness, a slight oniony aftertaste, a touch of pepper.
M - Clean, crisp, bright and refreshing, not too bitter, a slight warmth.
O - This is hands down one of the best IPA's I've ever had, better than Heady, and Pliny for sure, the lemon and line in this beer is just exploding, its so delicious. 853 charactersOmnium, Oct 25, 2013

Pour is orange with some clarity. White/yellowish head retains as a thick, partial cap through most of the duration leaving bits of lace behind. Excellent fruity hops scent. Very nice citrus, mango, tropical fruits. Well-balanced with sweet malts.
The taste still has plenty of tropical fruit mango peach wonder with a good dose of earthy and grassy hops as well. Nice sugar cookie and biscuit malts very present but letting the hops shine. Mouthfeel is fine, lowish carbonation with a big creamy feel and low-medium bitterness. Average drinkability.
Really great tropical fruit flavors coming out of this one with a big malt balance. I kinda wish it was a touch less sweet/more bitter but pretty damn alright as it is. 803 charactersChico1985, Sep 08, 2013

I can't think of a better time to drink this, Sunday afternoon, waning days of summer, heavy thunderstorms reign down outside, with torrential downpours. It was the kind of rain that forced a 10 mph drive home from the supermarket as the rain poured in sheets over the windshield making it almost impossible to see, as well as a flood of water cascading down the street almost making it possible to swim the car home.
Cracking the growler, again filled to the tippity top as Tree House usually does, pours into my Tree House tulip glass with a stream connected to the side of the glass, and forms a decent 1 finger foamy bubbly head that has a tough time staying at first, but then seems to settle on a nice head covering, with some decent lacing, not as great as Julius does these days, but still a nice head and decent lacing. The beer is a mostly hazy apricot wheat orange blond colored beer.
Nose erupts out the gate, as soon as i popped the swing top, those perfumey aromas started to trickle out, but then the pour just released the beast of aromas, great hop presence, a cross of mostly citrusy slight tropical fruit hops, with a touch of a grassy pine and aromatic floral hop presence. The hops first bring that citrus note, layers of tangerine, orange juice, as well as light stone fruit like an apricot and peach aroma, nectarine, etc. A hint of a tropical fruit comes in behind that, you really have to look for it to find it though, a touch of a papaya and guava. Then, the citrus and fruits seem to disappear and give way to light resinous musty fresh hop resin, bringing a hint of pine and earthy forest, but not a lot of that. Then finally a light malty sweet kick attempts to balance it all, with a touch of an amber sweet malt.
Taste is like a fistful of hops melting in my mouth. The creamy malt base really does it justice as it balances and melts the hops all over the tongue so it seems to get a nice representation everywhere. The hops again present themselves in waves, and once again with the citrus. An orange julius flavor, or creamsicle like flavor thanks to the creamy malt feel, with again that big juice tangerine flavor, big time tangerine in this like a tangerine bomb went off in my mouth. Then into tropical fruit again, light with hint of grapefruit pith, papaya, just a touch of musty passion fruit and guava even. Some nice pineapple hidden in there too. Then again into stone fruit, just keeps coming with fruit, light apricot, peach, nectarine, and even a touch of melon, quite nice. And following a similar pattern to the nose, a final push of spicy piney hops comes in as if to say, "don't forget about us", with an oily hop resin and little musty hop cone like sucking the sap right off a hop cone, with a nice dank resin. As I mentioned before, the malts bring a nice slightly sweet balance to offset the fairly big bitterness and what should be a touch of warming booze but it seems to disappear, and bring a nice creamy taste and touch of an amber malt flavor. Finish is drier too but sticks to the mouth a bit thanks to a mild sweetness and the creamy feel, with a nice long lingering bitterness that seems to be just the right amount, light pine and spicy hop presences, a bit more citrus and fruit but not a lot of either, more just a hop presence.
Mouth is med bodied but a nice creamy feel, the carbonation is a bit on the lighter side, but still nice and goes well with the creamy feel.
Overall what else can I say, this is an awesome IPA. Just a touch below Julius, but really up there, a different beast than Julius. This brings some of the tropical fruit, citrus, stone fruit, etc, but blends in a nice piney resin, slight spicy earthy touch, and that nice creamy malt base with an almost perfect balance. I really wish you guys would make more of this! 3,924 charactersjlindros, Sep 01, 2013

A - Poured a slightly hazy, light amber/gold color with a foamy, cream-colored head. After the head dissipated it left foamy bubbles on the sides of the glass and on top of the beer.
S - Smells fantastic! Definitely one of my favorites that I've experienced. Getting lots of tropical fruits...mango, some pineapple, and some tangerine. I'm also getting some hints of pine mixed in as well. There's also a solid malt background that I can notice once I get past the tropical fruits.
T - Oh man, this is wonderful...so complex and drinkable. Lots of mango, pineapple, and citrus up front melding into soft pine at the finish. Very well balanced with strong, bread-like malt presence throughout. The 7.6% ABV is hidden surprisingly well...I don't notice it other than the slight warming effect I'm experiencing as I'm enjoying my glass.
M - Creamy and silky smooth. Carbonation is a bit higher than some of the other Tree House brews I've had, but it's far from over-carbonated. Very easy to drink, possibly the easiest IPA to put down that I've experienced thus far. 
O - Hands down, this one of my favorite IPAs. I, personally, love this beer. A must try for any IPA lover. 1,253 charactersCJRubes, Sep 01, 2013

A - Pours an orange hazy hue with a one finger white head that fades to leave a soapy blanket with nice lacing and halo.
S - Dank citrus pops out of this along with nice wet hops and light tropical mango/pineapple. Light malty sweetness and pine resin as well.
T - Bitter hop oils and resins. Lots of the tropical fruits are gone sadly but replaced by a bitter pine forest. Nicely done but a bit deceiving.
M - Mouthfeel is solid. Nice, oily pine bitter finish with nice carbonation. Well done.
O - Overall this was a delicious fresh IPA. Wish the tropical hops were on the flavour instead of just the nose but still, enjoyable. 725 charactersrudzud, Jan 23, 2013

A- Pours a slightly golden hazy brown with about a quarter finger of white frothy head that recedes fairly fast leaving some light lacing. Not too much carbonation.
S- Nice floral presence with green hops balanced nicely with a light matly backbone. Notes of pine, slight sap, light citrus, a bit of pineapple, and light sweet malts. Nice pleasant aroma that has a decent aroma strength.
T- Fairly floral presence of green hops mixed with pineapple, light tangerine, sappy pine, finishes fairly bitter with a nice lingering hop presence. Nicely balanced.
M- Medium bodied, very drinkable, fairly low carbonation.
O- This was a nice IPA that had a fairly strong floral presence to it. It definitely wasn't my favorite IPA and I liked Eureka considerably more, but I think Tree House definitely achieved what they were trying to go for. The thing I liked the most in this beer was the balance- the hops and malts blended very well to provide an interesting and fairly tasty IPA. 1,075 charactersjaasen64, Jan 12, 2013
