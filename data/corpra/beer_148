Almost no head to speak and not a bubble that lingers. Smell is very boozy. Very strong vanilla barrel notes.  Roasted undertone with caramel notes. The taste is roast forward with a hint of an anise note. Strong boozy back end. Not caramel in the actual taste but the smell of it kind of carries through along with the vanilla. Feel is thick and coating. Overall an excellent example of how a great RIS gets even better with barrel aging. 525 charactersAmguerra305, Oct 31, 2016

Cork released without a pop....inky, oily black with a think caramel head that quickly disappeared
Nose has molasses and brown sugar. Prunes and plums as well.
This site lists ABV as 11.5%, but my bottle is labeled 13.9%. It's a big beer for sure, but it doesn't come off as boozy as that number would suggest.
Vanilla and fudge appear after a few sips.
Smooth without a bite. Has a bit of chew to it.
Really an excellent offering from Stone. 480 charactersTrojanRB, May 09, 2016

BATCH No 01
Served in a snifter
Review #1175
The cork came off with no noise and the beer wound up pouring what appeared to be a nearly still, dark brown/black. Medium-full bodied. Oily and shimmery in the glass. Quite ominous looking. The liquid was topped by a thin, frothy, mocha colored cap that quickly dissolved. No lacing whatsoever.
Amazing aroma. Super fragrant and robust. Bourbon came through big time. Vanilla and coconut notes practically smacked me in the face. Loads of molasses and brown sugar. Fairly chocolatey. Rich, smooth, fudge-y, dark chocolate. Dark fruits were also apparent. Raisins and prunes came through strong. Touch of booziness. As the beer sat, the aroma really intensified. The vanilla and coconut notes became especially potent.
The flavor profile was also big and bold but not quite as smooth as the aroma initially. Huge bourbon presence. Loads of coconut and vanilla. Intense roasted malt notes. Fairly sweet. Brown sugar and molasses were quite apparent. Strong dark fruit notes. Definitely some charred raisins. The beer finished with a moderate, boozy/bourbon-y kick and a bit of lingering roastiness. As the beer sat, the flavors intensified and the roasty notes subsided. More sweetness came forth. The vanilla and coconut intensified. Milk chocolate notes also appeared. Some caramel as well.
The beer contained a very fine and mild carbobation that frothed up nicely on the palate. Slick snd smooth. Just enough effervescence to keep the liquid moving along the palate. Interesting and fairly unique for the style.
Fyodor's Classic is a big, bold, complex, bourbon-forward imperial stout and one of the better examples of the style I have yet to come across. I am typically not a huge fan of Stone's original Russian Imperial Stout, but the bourbon barrel treatment and year of age on this bottle transformed it into an entirely different entity. Fans of vanilla and coconut forward beers should especially seek this one out. 2,098 charactersDamian, May 02, 2016

Drinking a 2008 with a 11.9% abv at stone
Look - it's aged so it's thin, it's black so it's a imperial stout.  I don't usually give something a 5 but it's impressive.
Smell - sweet bourbon Carmel smell
Taste - boozy Carmel with a slight dark chocolate.
Feel - smooth light body as expected for a aged bba beer.
Overall - great but better without bba. 356 charactersdrdiesel9483, Feb 09, 2016

Smells initially of strong booze but that smell dissipates as the glass warms and the beer opens. Tastes of bourbon, with slight hints of chocolate and oak. Incredibly smooth. My bottle is marked at 13.9% and the beer tastes at half that abv. Mouthfeel is thin, especially for the style. Overall it is good, but might be better fresh. Would definitely like to try a newer bottle. 459 characters_RL_, Jan 23, 2016

4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I picked up a bottle of this at the brewery when I visited the brewery for the third time in my life back in July of last year.  This bottle is 2015 Series Batch # 1.  It was bottled in March of 2015 after being barrel aged for 7 months.  Comes in a 500 ml bottle with a cock in the top.  This batch also clocks in at 13% AVB, which is 1.5% higher than what is listed for this beer in this beer's data base, so evidently this beer's ABV % changed at least in this batch I have a bottle from.   Poured into my tulip glass, this beer pours a very dark brown, almost black color of course that is not at all interested in letting in any light whatsoever.  Has a tan head that's about an inch thick when first poured before settling to a very thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with a big cluster of foam on the beer's surface.  Has decent lacing.  Aromas of dark roasted malts, hints of licorice, dark fruits such as plums and raisin, very toasted bread, and bourbon are present.  The taste is pretty much the same, with a toasted, bread like maltyness upfront that gives way to hints of licorice and plum and raisin sweetness that gives way to oak and vanilla, a hint of chocolate, and a bit of bourbon.  All the different flavors really blend together extremely nicely.  This is also one of the least hoppy beers I have had from Stone, and one of a very few if not the only one I think I've ever had from them where I can say that there really is no discernible hop presence at all in the flavor profile.  And for this beer that is just fine indeed.  This one really needs to sit and warm up a bit for all the flavors to really make their presence known properly.  Has an extremely smooth, just slightly crisp, smooth and frothy, slightly chewy and oily, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with light to moderate carbonation.  This one really coats the inside of my mouth and the flavors linger for quite awhile after each sip.  Has a fairly dry aftertaste.  A damn fine beer from Stone.  This fantastic beer is yet another reminder of why if I had to narrow it down to one single brewery out there, Stone would have to be my number one.  This is an exceptionally good beer!

Pours almost black, opaque, with no head, some soapy lacing.  Smells of bourbon, malts- not a heavily roasted aroma, a little oak, some vanilla.  Taste brings more of a roasty malt flavor, bourbon, oak, chocolate, some vanilla.  Smooth, full bodied, well carbonated.
Even though the aroma leads with bourbon, this is a well balanced and blended beer.  Well worth a purchase, but I'm thinking the base beer, overall, is better. 473 charactersstortore, Nov 15, 2015

Bottle batch 2014: the label states beer was brewed 1/29/13, then barrel aged on "American Oak Bourbon Barrels" for 12 months
Aroma of leather, dark licorice , raisin, whiskey, over-toasted dark bread
Tastes as it smells plus dark, chocolate malty roast,bourbon very present but well integrated. Light pleasant char. 
Mouthfeel is distinct from other 'super stouts' - dry finish and slight chalky char ( very slight) work well to keep it smooth, not sweet. Still a tad thin for the category, but definitely not lacking. Just different than viscosities presented by BCBS or Eclipse.
Superb, but not better than the 2 aforementioned RIS. Drier, less sweet, and well put together.  A year has done well on this. 753 charactersJjski, Oct 01, 2015

S: Roasted malt, Earth, coffee, and a strong alcohol scent, I'm assuming this is from the barrel aging
T: Roasted malt on the nose, fades into an extreme booziness, but its accented with a nice touch of vanilla and dried fruit
F: Silky smooth, has that big stout feel
O: An excellent stout, it's a big beast and not for the faint of heart. The Bourbon aging adds a complex alcohol taste and texture that seems all so fitting with a nice stout as the base. 546 charactersZakFaruki, Sep 29, 2015

Aroma of light roasted malt, black chocolate with some strong vanilla and bourbon notes with some woody notes also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by strong bourbon notes and vanilla which mix in well with the black chocolate and light roasted malt notes. Woody notes and residual sugar notes re also perceptible. Body is full with nice creamy texture with low carbonation and some warming alcohol is present. World-class barrel-aged stout! 555 charactersPhyl21ca, Sep 21, 2015

Strikingly similar but this was superior, though not by much. Barely any carb, just a hint. Jet black. Nose is what excels here over the Parabola. Just one man's opinion. Bourbon, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla. Beautiful. Taste is bourbon and oak on the front. Followed by a smoky chocolate with a great bitter coffee finish  Feel is viscous. Coats the mouth and lingers for almost a minute. Overall this is the best BBA RIS I've ever had and the highest rating I've ever given as of this review. 611 charactersLADaveBN, Aug 25, 2015

4.54/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the bottle into a large snifter glass.  2015 series Batch 1.
Deep black walnut body, a half finger tan head, dissolving to a simple puck with very fine bubbles and a whispy start tanned sheen top.   Pretty basic, simple and solid without fault.
Real nice subtle aroma.  Mild and soft char with a deep piping roast.  Thick bodied malt, almost smokey, has a deep herbal woody tone to it hinting somewhere between black licorice and fruity dark qualties.  Soft.  Not boozy.  Licorice notes comes out chewy and thick on the nose after some time.  Very nice.
With that first sip, the slow creep comes, with utmost surprise and a big creeping palate.  Excellent mouthfeel, deep and chewy with big round feel and mouth coating.  Sweet dark malts slightly in the mid palate, a bit of sweet char and tobacco, but the finish is where this excels.  Aftertaste grows and grows like a perfectly planted big aromatic licorice tree.  Soft anise qualities turn to a deep thick chewy licorice note, black, bold, dry tannic finish but tolerable and rich, slowly growing with each passing second after the swallow.  
Rich, luscious, the licorice angle on this is impressive and totally unexpected and as a black licorice fan I am loving it.  Body jumps in and out with light character char, and silky roast, but all the great qualities have percolated to the top.  Not going to be everyone's cup of tea I think, but works wonders for me. 1,434 characterssmakawhat, Jul 31, 2015

Pours pitch black with 2-finger tan head (Delirium Tremens glass). Retention is average. Smell is rich, bourbon, coffee, chocolate, rye bread. Flavor - roasted malts, chocolate, licorice, bourbon notes, woody notes.  Smooth, silky, low carbonated and surprisingly drinkable. 306 charactersDentist666, Jun 30, 2015

More hot chocolate than coffee flavors to be sure. What is really impressive is how well it maintaims both richness of flavor and integrity to its mouthfeel to the last drop. A lot of vig stouts weaken after sitting in the glass, but this one is consistently great all the way through. Considering I'm not too keen on the ashey notes of most Stone stouts, this one has flavors that over-ride those notes yet still have a hint of them there. Best Stone brew I've ever had. 561 charactersCasanovaCummins, Jun 28, 2015
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Not much else I can say but soaringly fucking glorious.  Wire-to-wire this is an incredible beer.  So glad I could find and share with my friends.  This BA stout is without question in a class by itself.  I don't like to compare beers head-to-head, but this special ale is probably the best BA stout I've ever had.
Ok decided to add some "constructive" character to this.  The reason I was so delirious over this beer is because I thought it was a thrill to the senses.  The smell of the beer is incredibly rich - I smelled toffee, bitter chocolate, roasted malts, and a perfect bourbon smell.  Other BA stouts I've tried didn't quite hit on the bourbon like this one did.  The taste backed up the smell 110%.  The beer is layered perfectly.  You get the rich, thick mouthfeel that all great stouts have, and your taste buds are lathered with roasted and semisweet malts, caramel, chocolate, a bit of dry bitterness, and the perfect bourbon compliment to finish off the flavor profile.  I just thought it was so well put together.  Really going to look for this the next time they release it.  I'll be buying 3 bottles at least. 1,129 charactersChcshammonde, Jun 27, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.752015 Series, Batch No. 1 (2014 Stone RIS aged 7 for months in American Oak Kentucky Bourbon Barrels - 13% ABV): Pours pitch black with a small creamy tan head that was full of tiny bubbles, fading rather quickly and leaving decent spotty lacing.  
Smells of vanilla, molasses, toffee, caramel, bakers chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, dark chocolate bar, bourbon, toasted coconut, Whoppers candy, oaky/woody notes, red wine, charred wood and brown sugar. The nose is very sweet and boozy, but does not cross the line into cloying and too sweet. There are more complexities to this nose, but all of the aromas above are so pronounced and evenly distributed that it is simply wonderful to inhale with the bourbon, char and earthy/oaky notes making the base beer smell even better. A perfect nose for a bourbon barrel aged RIS, I love the way this smells - it's exactly what I hoped for, nothing more to say. 
Wow, the flavor picks up right where the nose left off with rich vanilla, dark chocolate bar, bourbon, molasses, toffee, caramel, bakers chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, toasted coconut, Whopper's candy, Carvel hot fudge, oaky/woody notes, red wine very much like an oaky merlot, charred wood, maple syrup, light piney hops, mild licorice, some dark fruit and brown sugar. Like the nose the taste is sweet and boozy, but the booze is not hot or offensive, it's just present. Flavor also does not cross the line into cloying and too sweet, as the battle for attention shifts from bourbon to chocolate to char to sweet malt and then back to chocolate milk and then to coffee, then vanilla...etc., you get my point. It's dynamic, it's very complex and it's all over the place like a hyper toddler, but throughout this ADD drinking experience this beer really stands out as a delicious and better version of the base beer. This is a slow sipper that hides the 13% ABV very well, but I found myself drinking this faster than I should have because it was so damn smooth. I had Founders KBS a few times on tap this year, as well as Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout, Goose Island Bourbon County Vanilla Rye, Central Waters Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout and Lagunitas ScareCity #3: High West-ified Imperial Coffee Stout and Fyodor's Classic is right up there with them at the top of the class. Outstanding beer. 
Mouthfeel is slick and creamy smooth across the tongue with some heat that warms your belly, a medium chewy body that's a tad thin but still nice, and a nice charred, sweet aftertaste that's slightly bitter but full of rich, complex malt, chocolate and bourbon flavors. The lingering sweetness is a little ashy but the vanilla and roasted dark chocolate wash away any questionable flavors and leave a wonderfully complex coating that fades as good as the brew tasted.
World class indeed, I highly recommend this beer and plan to order another bottle online ASAP if there are any left. One of, if not THE best, RIS's of all time. 3,003 charactersCHickman, Jun 13, 2015

Light brown hues along the edges of the glass and even after an aggressive pour only a couple bubbles rise to the surface.  No lacing.  Heavy bittersweet chocolate dominate the aroma with bourbon also detectable.  Ridiculous flavors of baker's chocolate, vanilla, possibly some oak, and whiskey tantalize the palate.  Medium bodied, though close to full, brew with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel and perfect sweetness balancing the bitterness.  Wonderfully crafted bourbon barrel aged russian imperial stout by Stone that will satisfy those with a desire for well hidden big bold alcoholic stouts and those with a sweet tooth.  Well done!  Awesome! 739 charactersdpgoblejr, Apr 19, 2015

Look: light-eating black with barely any head. Beautiful like a precious stone.
Smell: sweet chocolatey Jesus. A hint of bourbon, maybe some astringency, but mostly just chocolate.
Taste: chocolate, bourbon, oak, and tons of bitterness. Not overly sweet, and really no alcohol heat.
Feel: silky, thick, and medium-dry.
Overall: for me, the bitterness is a bit overwhelming in the taste. I do like that the sweetness isn't overbearing. Good, but not great. 521 charactersneurobot01, Apr 15, 2015

From a 500ml bottle into a snifter
2013 Imperial Stout aged in Kentucky bourbon barrels for 12 months
Brewed 29 Jan 2013
Bottled February 2014
IBU: 38
Quingenti Millitre 2014 Series batch 3
APPEARANCE: A transparent black pour yields a 2+ finger, medium looking, bubbly tan head with good retention. Black body with no carbonation evident. Head recedes to a full cap. A ring remains until the end leaving some falling dots of lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla, coconut and cream on the nose. Toffee and butterscotch are there as well, with milk chocolate tying it together. Lots of barrel here, though a very nice barrel at that. 
TASTE: Bourbon, oak and coconut up front. Lots of barrel again. Coconut, vanilla and milk chocolate at the swallow with a bold and lingering finish of bourbon, vanilla and coconut again, oak, toffee and milk chocolaty sweetness, some bitter, pure chocolate and a hint of burnt malts as well. Very flavorful. Really like the barrel flavors here. Some alcohol lingers as well. 
PALATE: Medium-thinner body with medium levels of carbonation. A bit abrasive on the palate, goes down with a bit of a scratch and finishes rather sticky. Some heat lingers. 
OVERALL: Loved the nose and flavor profile on this. The barrel is strong, but the character it imparts on the beer is really enjoyable. The look is okay and the feel could be fuller and less abrasive, but this brew is a whopping 14% after all. Not as boozy as others at this ABV. Overall, this is a good beer I was happy to sip on for an evening. If you can get one, give it a shot. Thanks again ScottO. Recommended. 1,831 charactersJeffo, Mar 05, 2015

A - Thick, deep espresso black body.  Dark mocha head pours 1/2 a finger high with ok retention and lace.
S - Outstanding nose.  Rich and thick with milk chocolate, brandy, oak, tons of vanilla, touch of nutmeg, and almonds.  Great integration. 
T - Medium roast latte, milk chocolate, warm scotch, hazelnut, vanilla, oak, caramel, toffee, and soft cream.  Fantastic balance and integration.  A shade boozy.
M - Super smooth, creamy, medium-full body.  Almost perfect.
O - An awesome beer.  Stone RIS is one of my favorite stouts, and I'd argue it's one of the best bombers you can buy for under $10.  The BA version is an absolute treat, and is more than worth the hype. 728 charactersvfgccp, Jan 11, 2015

Nutty, vanilla, dark chocolate, prunes, roasted malt, a fruity bourbon with a heavy wood character. The flavor is delicious. It's very chocolaty with the bourbon in the back. There is a slight heat from the alcohol, but it is in no way boozy. It's insanely well balanced. This beer was bottled in Feb of this year making it ten months old. This is the oldest bourbon barrel aged stout I've had. It's perfectly balanced, but I wonder if that is because of the age. Either way ba da ba ba ba...I'm lovin' it. 594 charactersBenwayPHD, Nov 30, 2014

4.55/5  rDev +1.8%Given how rich and intense IRS is, very excited to get into this one.
Appearance is very similar, maybe a bit thinner looking and very minimal head.
Subtle but enticing aroma of barrel char, vanilla, bakers chocolate, chalky cocoa, hints of dark fruit and touch of coconut. 
Slick body, though thinner than the reg IRS.  Intense flavors - bitter espresso and chocolate - barrel char.  The finish is relatively short.
Very happy to have finally tried BA IRS - great beer.  Would like to see some with age and side-by-side with a 2013 reg. 541 characterstimc100, Nov 15, 2014

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Fyodor's Classic was the best BBA beer that i've had. By the time it had been a good while after the release of it (last one in the shelf). 
Appearance of it was pitch black, not one ray of light could pass. Very low carbonation, which I prefer. Even as I was pouring, you could tell it was incredibly smooth. 
Smell - I could definitely smell a lot of vanilla, oak, and hints chocolate. While the vanilla and oak smells were overpowering, I was still able to get hints of the chocolate. You could distinctively recognize each smell. There is also a good smell of bourbon towards the end of the whiff. 
Vanilla (strong), Oak (strong), Chocolate (mild), Bourbon (strong).
Taste - It was definitely very smooth, got mostly vanilla, and some oak. 
At the end, you get a real nice kick of bourbon which went really well with the lingering vanilla taste for me.
Vanilla (strong), Oak (mild), Chocolate (weak), Bourbon (strong)
Mouth - Full bodied and the bourbon aging really makes it hit you. Definitely a bit sticky from the BBA. 
Overall - Fantastic RIS, you don't miss out on anything in this beer, really hits the spot. 1 will definitely do the trick (at least for me it does). Nice and high ABV. Cannot wait to have another. 1,230 charactersGabrielBelm0nt, Aug 13, 2014

A black with a thin cola edge, a finger of foam hangs around for a sip leaving no lace, some color left behind on the glass and wide legs after a swirl 
S chocolate fudge, vanilla, lots of bourbon barrel, plenty of booze, coconut, licorice, faint coffee and more booze
T more of the same, heaps of bourbon barrel, very boozy, vanilla, coffee, not much of the coconut and licorice I was smelling, it tastes great just with lots of booze
M full bodied but not quite chewy, booze hits you all over, going down, my chest, stomach and brain, slick in the mouth and just a little sticky on the lips, booze and barrel on the finish 
O shes a big beer and doesn't keep it a secret, in your face bourbon barrel, booze all over, lots of flavor, I wish I had another to age
I liked it a lot but preferred the espresso version Mikhail's Odd, great beer but could use a few years of cellar time too mellow out 1,001 characterswordemupg, Aug 04, 2014

Pours pitch black with a small mocha head on top. Beautiful aroma of anise, vanilla, roast, bourbon, oak, some chocolate. Oh yea. Reminds me a bit of Black Note. Flavor is roast, bourbon, dark fruits, oak, chocolate, anise, light booze, and long lasting vanilla. Really beautiful finish on this one with definite whiskey tones. The mouthfeel is medium--only slightly lacking in body in the style and would love to see the thickness ramped up a tad--with low plus carbonation and a smooth bourbon vanilla warmth down the throat.

The smell is of dark chocolate, pipe tobacco, dark fruit and vanilla. 
The taste is of dark chocolate, sweet dark fruit, black coffee and earthy, herbal oak.
The texture is heavy bodied and creamy with low carbonation. 
No aging necessary. This beer is absolutely world class as-is. Huge dark chocolate, sweet dark fruit and subtle bourbon. Underrated because of its availability, this one will go toe-to-toe with any bourbon barrel imperial stout twice its age. 577 charactersFurlinator, Jul 20, 2014

Appearance - Deep black body. Nearly inky. Small khaki head. Thin collar and a few wisps.
Smell - Dark chocolate. Fudgy. Bourbon is secondary, but quickly becomes dominant. Sharp oak. Lots of vanilla.
Taste - Bitter chocolate right up front. Oak amplifies it. Bourbon builds. Slight sweetness, but it's overpowered by oak and bitter chocolate.
Mouthfeel - Thick. Medium carbonation.
Overall - A step above other Bourbon stouts. The quality of the base beer truly impresses. 613 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 08, 2014

S: Tons of chocolate, booze, bourbon, some anise, tobacco, caramel, and vanilla. This beer makes its' presence known once you pop the cork! The best part about the aroma to this beer is that it is strong and does not fade, most other stouts have a smell that becomes faint after a minute or two of pouring, but this one is brash and in your face the whole time! It's superb!
T: Woah... Upfront there is loads of bourbon mixed with a perfect amount of booze, in the middle you get an awesome amount of chocolate, vanilla, a little anise, and caramel, then on the finish you get everything from the beginning and middle all perfectly mixed together with an addition of a hint of tobacco and hop bitterness, as it goes down you get a nice warmth from the booze. This beer is pretty well balanced with the characteristics that can make it unenjoyable, but for things that it needs plenty of to make it outstanding, and it has plenty of those ingredients! Superb transitions of flavors, and it gets even smoother as it warms as well! Definitely one of the best barrel aged stouts I have had!
M: Very thick, slightly oily, and a slight creaminess to it, fantastic, the feel suits this beer perfectly, makes you sip it, and enjoy it!
O: Phenomenal beer from Stone! I wish I can get my hands on more of these! You have to try this! 1,541 charactersKnowYourCraft, Jun 08, 2014

The beer is near black with a thick, oily, beige head. Sparse lacing. The aroma offers big bourbon and oak notes, with chocolate and roast. Sweet chocolate with a grandiose bourbon presence. Sweetness is calmed by a graceful alcoholic warmth in the finish. A delightful beer to sip. At near 14%, I can make this last the duration of the hockey game (Blackhawks vs. Kings game 7). Go Hawks! Overall, an outstanding beer and top notch example of the style. 639 charactersHuhzubendah, Jun 02, 2014

A- Pitch black, thinnest of lacing with no legs. This poured with little carb; but it drinks just fine. 
S- Tons of chocolate upfront, toffee caramel are in equal proportion. The bourbon barrel isn't totally hidden, but for a 14% ba stout, it is amazingly hidden. 
T- Big chocolate upfront followed by toffee then a nice malt backbone. The barrel is noticeable, but not 14% noticeable. For those who think BCBS is too hot fresh, this is your brew at the same ABV.
M- Pretty smooth, somewhat creamy but not crazy noticeable. The only know is the lack of carb that I stated above shows just a bit too much here, which doesn't make sense. 
O- A fantastic BA stout! The complexity of the chocolate and how this is drinking at 14% is why I rated this so high. I love the base, and Stone nailed the BA version 895 charactersgueuzedreg, May 02, 2014

Appearance: Pitch black, with a tan creamy head that dissipated fairly quickly. A little lacing and some tiny bubbles that remained around the edge and some in the middle. Looks great in the glass.
Smell: Heavy bourbon smell, getting some alcohol, but surprisingly for a 13.9% ABV, the alcohol smell is not prevalent. I am not getting any other aromas on the nose. A little dark cherries, has a great aroma.
Taste: You get the woody, bourbon flavor right up front, some dark fruity flavor, the alcohol is on the back end and lingers in the aftertaste. Great flavor! 
Mouthfeel: Like motor oil but not as thick as some other barrel aged stouts I have tried. Some carbonation, the alcohol warms the palate and the belly. 
Overall: I have tried several BA stouts and this one has to be the smoothest. I was surprised at the quality because Stone has not greatly impressed me with their beers. This one is world class. What a great beer worth the $20 I put down. I am going to get another bottle to cellar. 1,070 charactersBrolo75, Apr 26, 2014

4.91/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - 4.5 - dark brown black beer with a nice mocha head that doesn't stick very long
S - 4.75 - huge bourbon and barrel notes, background is definitely chocolate, coffee and caramel. It's a little harder to pick up some of the dark malt notes in this one because the bourbon/booze is so strong. 
T - 5 - Huge chocolate, coffee with bourbon barrel, smoke and toasted wood flavors. Burnt marshmallow, smores. It's one hell of a complex beer. 
M - 5 - This is one thick beer when you drink it through the initial head. Wierdly, as the head dissipates the body of the beer seemed to as well, probably due to the dryness from the high alcohol content. Nonetheless, a damn good beer. Alc is present and a little in your face, aftertaste is chocolate, coffee, mocha latte, and roasted malts. 
O - 5 - What a good beer. Parabola or Big Bad Baptist fits my own tastes better, but this beer is damn close to being just as good. I think the bourbon barrel qualities go great with the stone RIS flavors, and the aging helps everything meld together even better than it does in the original beer. 1,083 charactersISmith87, Apr 14, 2014

A: Pitch black body capped by an espresso brown head that recedes quickly. Some spotty lacing left on the glass.
S: Bold bourbon notes of caramel, vanilla, and oak. Hint of coffee, chocolate covered cherry, and bourbon soaked dark fruit as it opens up. Glorious.
T: Boozy bourbon and espresso upfront, caramel and bourbon soaked vanilla follow. A bit of dark cherry as well. Very low levels of residual sweetness for an RIS. Not as potent as the nose, but still fantastic.
M: Medium bodied for an IRS with medium/low carb levels. Flavor compounds are extremely palate coating despite the lack of viscosity compared to other examples.
O: Exactly what I should have expected when one of my favorite RIS was bourbon barrel aged. Fantastic offering from Stone, I can't wait to see what some age does to my extra bottle! 848 charactersMore_betterness, Apr 01, 2014

S: Right away, you're smashed in the face with bourbon, charred oak, and roasted malt. There's really not hint of sweetness to be found here. The barest trace of vanilla and toffee is quickly chased away by a mob of bourbon, anise and wet earth. 
T: A huge wave of roasted malt and bourbon crash over your palate right away. Burnt coffee, charred wood and unsweetened baking chocolate hit in the middle, leading into a burnt fudge and bourbon finish that lingers and gives a pleasant warmness. Mouthfeel is velvety and a touch slick. If you don't enjoy bourbon, forget about this one. But if you do, this is money. Stone absolutely destroyed it with this and Mikhail's Odd. 803 charactersnotchucknorris, Mar 27, 2014

A: pours a midnight black with a light brown head. Dense and fairly large head for a BA stout. 
S: mostly whiskey and oak with some chocolatey notes. 
T: improves greatly as it warms. Milk Chocolate, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and a quality bourbon flavor that is very well balanced and doesn't mask the taste of the base beer. 
M: Thick, fairly low carbonation, no heat from the barrel. pretty ideal for an RIS. 
Overall, it's not the one of the few best BA stouts I've had but it's definitely near the top of that next tier. 630 charactersPerderick, Mar 25, 2014

An ineffably generous friend sent me this long-time personal white whale out of the blue a couple of weeks ago (thanks Mike!). With one of my close beer drinking friends having a baby in less than a month and the other leaving town for a couple of months on business, now seemed as good as a time as ever to share this brew.
Score: 97
2008 vintage elixir from a 1 liter growler, served in a Hunahpu's snifter and enjoyed on 03/15/14. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Pours a deep brown cola color with ruby-caramel highlights and a finger of khaki head that settles to a ring around the glass. Poor lacing and retention, but good oily legs. 4/5
Smell: Dark chocolate, whiskey and figs. A little bit of dark cherry, and a kiss of lovely oxidation. Not overly complex, but extremely pleasant smelling. 4.75/5
Taste: Tastes like dark chocolate and whiskey, with a touch of fruit! No booziness, not sweet, not very bitter; just balanced and with a lasting finish. A delicious cocoa powder flavor develops in the finish as this brew warms. The taste, like the nose, is very straightforward, but it marvelously delivers in a no frills, no nonsense way. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-plus bodied, good carbonation. Incredibly creamy mouthfeel with a light dryness to the finish. Almost perfectly balanced -- not too sweet or too bitter. 4.75/5
Overall: For a beer I have long sought after, there is little more I could have asked for here. I was not in the least bit disappointed given my high expectations and this beers reputation. What this one lacked in depth and "evolving flavors" as it warmed up and breathed, it more than made up for in sheer deliciousness. This was one of the easiest to drink barrel aged stouts I have tackled in a long while. Just wish I had more than 1 liter to go around. Thank you again Mike for sending me this treat. Prost!

A: Black with a dark brown head; moderate carbonation
S: Pretty even split between dark fruits and bourbon, not much else
T: Big dark fruits followed by subtle bourbon/oak/vanilla/roast
M: Full bodied, but not too thick. It's pretty typical for the style
O: A very interesting offer from Stone. It's definitely tasty and I'm quite surprised how fruity it is. I enjoyed it quite a bit more as it warmed up and highly recommend it if you see it on tap. I do prefer the non-BA version, but this is still a very good beer. 573 charactersDrucifer, May 22, 2013

A: Served in a goblet, BBL RIS was dark black with a very small brown head on top that dissipated quickly. No lacing on this beer, not overly surprising. 
S: Plenty of bourbon right away, it really dominates the aroma, a bit surprising after 5 years. Some chocolate with a little bit of caramel and brown sugar. 
T: Similar to the aroma, lots of chocolate (sort of like brownies) and bourbon. It was on the sweet side, with only some light roast. There was a bit of wood as well. 
M: Full bodied with low to medium carbonation. Fairly smooth and surprisingly easy to drink, though that could have been because it tasted so good. 
O: Been waiting to try this beer for a while, glad to have finally had the chance. 766 charactersmdaschaf, May 21, 2013

T - Bourbon up-front. Subtle chocolate, malty background.

Pours a jet black opaque color with a modest chocolate brown head that dissipates fairly quickly.
Chocolate, bourbon, and oak are accentuated by roast malt and coffee in the aroma.
Sweet and rich throughout, there are huge chocolate and soy flavors upfront, accompanied by deeply roasted malt that lacks the acrid character sometimes present. The aftertaste is fairly toasted and nutty. Bourbon weaves its way into the flavor throughout.
Body is fairly full, with low carbonation and significant alcohol heat.
Wonderful improvement to a wonderful beer. Not as much roast dominance as in the regular version. 626 charactersbarczar, Feb 11, 2013

Tan bubbles cling onto the sides of the glass but no head forms. Aroma is beautiful buttery bourbon, coconut, vanilla, oak, rich smokiness. Taste is a giant smack in the face of unsweetened, bitter chocolate, smoked malt, hot bourbon moving very quickly to silky chocolate, coconut, vanilla ice cream. Palate goes from soft to chalky and bitter cacao powder. About six seconds after tasting this I knew exactly why it is in the ratebeer Top 20. Everything is there: the aroma, the body, the palate. It is like Bourbon Country Stout with a little less richness and less of a superlative palate. 10/24/2010 8/4/9/4/16=4.1 718 characterstarheels86, Nov 13, 2012

2008 Vintage.
Pours thick and coating.. the head is dark brown and frothy... lasts forever.. the brew stains the glass with each swirl.
Aromas are awesome... brownie batter... Tootsie Roll.. oaky bourbon.. scattered chocolate covered toffee.. 
The flavor delivers big time!! Vanilla and chocolate battle things out... never any real "bourbon", just the elements that make bourbon fun! Very integrated.. burnt.. bitter.. so yummy.
Much better than I expected... I don't give Stone a fair shake... I need to re-up my cellar and normal expenditures.

2008 vintage.
Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is exceptional and is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, cookie dough, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. There is also a slight port aroma that emerges as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a fantastic nose and a great flavor. 718 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jul 08, 2012

Look: Black in color with not real head no retention but it does leave a small film on the glass when you drink it down
Smell: Bourbon oak roasted malts vanilla and chocolate. Pretty straight forward
Taste: Again bourbon upfront backed up by quite a bit of roasted malts. Finishes with touches of vanilla and chocolate
Mouthfeel: Full body low carbonation
Overall: I can't believe how much bourbon is still present after all the age that has been put on it. I would like to try a fresh batch if they do it again. Good beer from stone but not great I thought the alcohol was just a bit distracting 648 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jun 05, 2012

This one was 2008 vintage - so awesome!
A: Black with half finger mocha head, not too much lacing.
S: oh man... HUGE bourbon smell - even after 4 years of aging. Oak, vanilla,chocolate aroma, Some nutty scent, roasted malt. 
T: It reallyl follows the nose - Bourbon, oak, chocolate, sweet brown sugar, believe it or not, it was still a bit boozy, but not too overwhelming. 
M: Still had some carbonation remaining, thick, syrupy, and sticky. You can still feel the alcohol burn. 
O: I am glad I got to try this one. This one is 100x improved version of Stone's regular RIS - but then again, I love bourbon aged beers in general. Maybe not for everyone, but man, this one was amazing. I wonder though how this beer would have tasted fresher - probably not as good and too hot and boozy. Anyway 2008 vintage was near perfect.

(A)- Pitch black color with some tan froth & lace.
(S)- A rich caramel body with some dry vanilla, cocoa, licorice, and oak.
(T)- Very similar to the smell. Lots of licorice, but is balanced well with a deep oak and vanilla with caramel and raisin.
(M)- A good carbonation level and balance. Not over-the-top but showcases the barrel aging well.
(D)- The regular version of this is always fantastic, but this definitely ups it a notch in strength and body. Excellent. 542 characterssweemzander, Apr 16, 2012

A - Black beer with a bit of a tan head that rose up a finger and faded to a tight ring. Didn't stay around for long but looked nice.
S - This is nicely smoothed out with some impressive bourbon. I've never felt like Stone RIS was the biggest of stouts, but it's held up pretty well in the barrel. 
T - Bourbon, chocolate, roast. Taste is quite nice, and very smoothed out. Really no heat on this with all the appropriate flavors.
M - Medium bodied, could be a little bit fuller, with some moderate carbonation.
O - Really nice beer. Stone RIS is very nice brew, and it did well in the bourbon. Could drink a lot of this one. 650 charactersAgentZero, Feb 20, 2012

Draft to 4oz taster
WinterStorm 2012
2008 Vintage
App- A pitch black pour. Very chocolate syrup in appearance. A 1/2" of head formed and then fell to about an 1/8" of bubbles with maybe at most a couple dots of cling.
Smell- Smelled really divine. A lot of rich bourbon with that booze not wofting up and had touches of oak and rich vanilla all over it.
Taste- The booze on this one is still very hot. The barrels still need some time to mellow which I thought was odd. Very prickly booze and then after comes a bit of creamy RIS malts and some vanilla and oak char notes.
Mouth- A medium to low body on this one with a medium prickly carbonation. Residual booze and a bit of creamy vanilla.
Drink- Overall, this wasn't as smooth as I would have hoped but it was a nice BBA RIS with good flavors, just lacked a little balance. 852 charactersFosterJM, Feb 06, 2012

2008 Stone RIS bourbon barrel
Pours jet black, blacker than black, not even the sun can more than barely light the very edges of this black as night imperial stout. A decent head pours though the weight of this (and the growler factor) quickly kills it. Just a jet black, opaque milkshake of a beer is left over here.
Aged RIS through and through, dark burnt molasses, coffee, faded floral hops, and yes bourbon goodness from start to finish. 
I like a bit of heat to my bourbon barrel aged beer. I like a strong bourbon flavor there as well. To put it simply this is heaven on earth! I doubt these were good bourbon barrels, there's a certain sour/heat effect that reminds me more of heaven hill and Jim Beam than a pappy or pogue quality bourbon, but that almost seems to be a perfect contrast to the RIS. A 2008 RIS right now is an over the top sweetness attack that frankly I'm not overly fond of. My fear was that instead of getting the amazing flavors that a fresh RIS from stone has, this one would be overly sweet and the bourbon barrel would add enough vanilla notes to just take things over the top. Instead this beer is a true flavorful master piece. Chocolate and molasses do a dance on the tongue battling for dominance while the oak and vanilla flavors from the bourbon coat every second of the experience. 
This beer is hot. There's no nice way to put it and at the supposed 10-11% range this claims it's too hot for the age. Still milk shake thick, enough carbonation to keep things creamy, and motor oil thick. It isn't bourbon county stout but it is really really trying to be.
The closest beer to this I have to say is bourbon county stout. Not just the body but the flavors as well. The difference is this tastes closer to a fresh bourbon county stout than an aged one. I had the 06 version of this years ago. It did not do it for me to say the least. This beer in contrast is simply great. Search it out at reasonable cost. 1,958 charactersbobhits, Nov 06, 2011

Just because the guy ordered sucky beers doesn't mean he needs to make the customer feel like a loser...anyways, a great bourbon barrel RIS overall, smooth, balanced, with glutenous complexity. 626 charactersccrida, Oct 20, 2011

The taste is really, really good, whiskey, wood, roasted grain, so different than the regular IRS which is already a good beer.

Taste is awesome, bourbon, sweet dark chocolate, alcohol is there but not overwhelming its rich and flavorful. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy but still smooth and very tasty. Finish is sharp and oaky. Very nice beer. 528 characterskingcrowing, Oct 16, 2011

Sweet and malty, bourbony with chocolate and vanilla. Nice...
It tastes just as good, insane. Move over BA Speedway, this is pushing to become the highest rated BA stout from the San Diego area. Thickish but adequately bubbly, excellent stuff. 546 charactersTurdFurgison, Sep 03, 2011

3.5 A: Black. Pour yielded no head.
4.5 S: The barrel aging is done extremely well. The bourbon portion is perfect. Incredibly smooth with leather, melon, prune, and plum. However, the underlying stout can't stand tall alongside. Some chocolate and roast, but does not seem to have the subtleties that the regular has at this age. Still, bourbon forward or not, smells delicious.
3.5 T: I have no idea where the Stone IRS went. This tastes a bit like watered down bourbon rather than a bourbon enhanced stout. There's just a little chocolate and a little roast. However, the bourbon itself makes this still taste great. Leather, melon, prune, and plum. Alcohol is very well hidden.
3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Could be creamier though.
3.5 D: Decent, but stout that can't stand tall above barrel treatments should not be put into barrels. I'm completely shocked that Stone IRS is one of these. 1,063 charactersDavoleBomb, Sep 01, 2011

Stoked that I got to try this rare treat.
Looks like your standard (delicious) BA stout. Inky black, thick, no head.
Whoa! Bourbon alert. There's nothing subtle about the BA on this one - super strong bourbon aroma right from the get go. If you struggle to swim through the booze you're rewarded with some dark fruit, anise, and chocolate.
Taste is also bourbon heavy, but not as much as the nose, especially as it warms. There's vanilla, quite a bit of anise, dark fruit, some oaky, coffee, roasted malt bitterness. Fairly complex.
Mouthfeel is dry and a bit thin from the oak aging.
Overall, bourbon is a bit overpowering on this. I have to say that I prefer the regular RIS (especially with a bit of age on it). Still, this is an awesome beer. 793 charactersreadbaron, Aug 31, 2011

2008 Stone IRS Aged in Bourbon Barrels
Dark black with a small brown head. Specks of lacing down the glass.
Rich aroma filled with chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, and a very mild addition of vanilla and wood from the barreling. Smells far more similar to the original than I would have expected, which, fortunately for me, is one of my favorite smelling beers of all time.
The chocolate sweetness is combined with a decidedly vanilla character from the barreling, along with roast, coffee, and dark fruits. The alcohol is exceptionally well hidden. Though this is divine, I think I prefer the original IRS. It's just so perfect, it doesn't need the barreling.
Medium to thick bodied.
A delicious barrel aged beer, though I actually still prefer the standard IRS. 873 charactersehammond1, Aug 30, 2011

4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this on tap at the International Beer Festival in Portland back in July. Served from a tap into a 4oz tasting glass. Apparently, this is the 2008 IRS aged in Elijah Craig barrels, for the record. $1 for a 4oz taster? I'll have one...or four.
Appearance: Doesn't get much more glorious in the stout department than this. Creamy, thick, viscous, blacker-than-black brew with beautiful lacing and a dense tan billowy, foamy head. Very inviting.
Smell: Strong notes of German Chocolate Cake, vanilla, smoked oak, light char, and somewhat-muted Bourbon. Suprisingly tame for such a huge beer, and the bourbon is more of a component, not the center-stage. The vanilla, however, simply become more rich and inviting as the beer opens up. 
Taste: In a word, stellar. Fantastically rich vanilla and cake-like chocolate notes are met with boozy-rich bourbon, oaky notes that finishes thick and chocolatey. Does not leave without a nice like of burning booze, and while many aspects of the beer became even more delicious as the beer warmed, there was an uptick in a bit of oxidation/soy sauce. Still, the flavor is overwhelmingly positive, and how a bourbon stout should be done in my estimatio, with the whiskey contribution being integrated and even rather than boisterous and heavy-handed.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, viscous, thick, chewy, fantastic. I wish all stouts were this silky and rich. Ain't no thin finish here, that's for sure. World-class.
Overall: Very, very impressed. The normal Stone IRS is delicious in its own right, and occasionally bourbon beers do the base beer a disservice by simply tasting like bourbon and losing the greatness of the underlying beer. Not here, and not by a long shot. Makes an outstanding beer better, and comes highly recommended. 1,767 charactersnomomentwasted, Aug 22, 2011
4.03/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served on tap in a snifter at Acre.
Appearance: As expected, this is pitch black with just a hint of mahogany and ruby in the edges.
Smell: The aroma is full of bourbon; it is in the forefront to the point where it kind of drowns out the other wonderful smells. Molasses, dark fruits, and a bit of anise and chocolate are pushed to the periphery. 
Taste: The flavor is again a bit strong on the bourbon for me, considering that the base beer is so good. It starts strong and stays on the palate through each sip. Behind that, some molasses and vague dark fruit sweetness start out, with vanilla, oak, and roasted malt rounding out the front. The roasted malt has a tinge of burnt character and flows into a coffee bitterness nicely as the sip progresses. The finish is lightly bitter with more bourbon.
Mouthfeel: This has a dry, woody, oaky feel, which makes it feel less full bodied than the original. Medium carbonation is on the creamy side. 
Overall: If I had this on its own, it would be a fine beer. The only issue is that Stone had the audacity to make IRS so good that drowning the flavor our with bourbon is a downgrade. Some people might like the bourbon treatment to be over the top, but I prefer it to be more nuanced. 1,236 charactersKickInTheChalice, Aug 22, 2011

A: Pours a very thick, opaque black color with a light brown head that is really dark, considering. The texture is viscous like dirty motor oil...it's absolutely beautiful. 
S: Aroma is equally amazing; sweet dark chocolate, heavy caramel, and a smooth bourbon accent. It's utterly enticing. 
T/M: Taste has some alcohol twinge up front but is quickly masked by chocolate and caramel notes with a bit of toffee and nut in the finish. There's very little aftertaste but it leaves a warming sensation. It rolls on your tongue and down your throat, like a liquid trapeze artist made of black roasted malts and bourbon. 
There are some apparent similarities with Sam Adams Utopias here, minus the complexity and overabundant strength, not to mention this one is actually carbonated, but it's the closest thing that comes to mind. It's like they took all the best qualities of Imperial Russian Stout and all the best qualities of a good bourbon and formed this monstrosity of a beer. I think I could drink this for the rest of my life, but I have to know which barrels they used... 1,128 charactersTheBeerAlmanac, Jul 14, 2011

Rich vanilla notes just percolating up, rounding out a beautiful bourbon smell. Some light chocolate and a tiny pinch of coffee in there, but this one is dominated by the barrel influence. As I take the first sip it is much more of the same. Rich bourbon notes just roll across the tongue with precision, rich notes of vanilla, a touch of woody undertone and a sparkling coffee induced finish just round this together wonderfully. Could have used a bit more carbonation, but still very nicely done with a big full feel and a long drawn out finish.
Overall this was very solid indeed. I really think it influenced and change the character of the irs wonderfully, making an almost complete transformation. I would have this one again any day and was thrilled to finally tick it 987 charactersmikesgroove, May 25, 2011

A - Inky black with a thin, mocha-colored head that recedes to a slight haze.
S - Sweet, dark roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, ash, oak, and high-quality bourbon. Phenomenal.
T - Very close to the nose, tons of dark malt, oak, caramel, vanilla, and bourbon. So smooth and drinkable despite the ABV, this one has aged wonderfully. Amazing.
M - Thick and creamy, with a medium-full mouth-feel and lowish carbonation. Slight burn from the bourbon in the finish, but that's fine with me.
O - Phenomenal beer, the highlight of my San Diego trip. An amazing take on an already legendary beer, I really want this bottled!&lt;hint, hint&gt; 674 charactersjsanford, May 17, 2011
4.26/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on-tap @ the iTap House in Chesterfield, MO. Poured into a Snifter and enjoyed only one as it was $5. This was the 2008 Version of this beer and in Bourbon Barrels (hence the name above).
Appearance- Dark Maple Brown color but almost black. Has a Half a finger of a Dark Tan Head and has sudsy lacing. 
Smell- Huge whisky smell with a deep alcohol scent, almost like rubbing alcohol. Very roasty and has many aromas I couldn't catch but possibly there will be a second time.
Taste/Mouthfeel- Has a rich flavor, very strong and profound! Let it be known that this is an Imperial Russian Stout! It has a beginning dark chocolate taste with a wood background. The alcohol is very warming and the bourbon is a bold characteristic that stays after the finish even. Has a Medium-Full Body, Viscosity of a Root Beer, and surprisingly smooth! 
Overall- While sampling the Chipotle Pepper Smoked Porter first (which I wasn't fond of), I went straight for this Russian Stout since it was very limited. Being aged in bourbon barrels gave it a great flavor and aroma characteristic. Could actually drink these all night even though it is a 11.5% stout. Will be recommending to friends and drinking again! 1,204 charactersDCon, May 07, 2011

2008 vintage poured into a small snifter glass.
A - Pitch black with little to no head.
S - A lot of bourbon followed by some roasted malts, chocolate, oak, and a hint of vanilla.
T - Very complex and tasty. Like the nose, there is a fair amount of bourbon here along with some vanilla and bittersweet chocolate. A few bitter hops are hiding in the back, but are easily overpowered by the other flavors.
M - Thick, smooth, and creamy.
O - An excellent barrel aged imperial stout. Big and bold and one of the most enjoyable barrel aged stouts I've had (and I've had several). I'd like to see this bottled at some point! 699 charactersratedz, Apr 29, 2011

S - There is tons of complexity in the nose. Starting with some boozy heat and sweetness from the bourbon. Mixes of burnt caramel, brown sugar, chocolate and some slight grassy hop. (4.0)

Some slight hop notes on the back end are felt but these definitely take a back seat. There is some nice roasted malt notes that blended well with the chocolate and the vanilla notes. Nice rich and creamy stout with lower carbonation and some good bourbon and boozy heat. (4.0)(4.5)

M - nice full body that goes down smoothly.
D - I can't believe this is an 08. Lots of molasses and lots of bourbon still lingering around. This could use some more time to mellow. However, I love heat and thought this was really good.

Served on tap at Waldo Pizza at the Total Tap Takeover. It was poured into a large snifter. This beer pours an oily India ink black with a decent 2 inch head that leaves just a bit of lacing on the sides of the snifter. The nose is big bourbon with dark chocolate and mild coffee. Little bit of oak and a bit of coconut. Heavy, heavy bourbon. The flavor is much the same with the bourbon playing front and center, drowning out everything else. Notes of chocolate and coconut with a bit of molasses play second fiddle. Too much Bourbon. The mouthfeel is nice and oily. Overall, this beer has just to much booze.

First, you might ask, why two glasses? When my limit was two glasses, & there were so many good beers? Well, I was convinced I was given the wrong beer the first time around. Turns out I was wrong. 
Black, of course, minimal bubbly excitement. The smell is a blast of smokiness that gets more & more pronounced as the beer warms, crowding out the malts & chocolatey sweetness that arrives initially. I swear, I was served the bourbon Smoked Porter, but no!
The second glass tastes just like the first. The bourbon is subtle, refined, restrained, just nipping around the edges of my taste buds & liver. Supremely smooth & creamy. But there it is again, the smokiness, creeping upwards, until at half-glass, it's dominating & crowding out the other tastes. WTF? After the second glass I really wish I'd have had something else.
Good beer, but in the company of other BA stouts this one would suffer by comparison. Glad I tasted it, but I'm going to stick to my beloved Oaked AB from now on, thank you very much Stone! 1,180 charactersmaximum12, Apr 01, 2011

Pure black in color with a frothy tan head that reduces to a collar, but leaves some lace.
Big bourbon smell up front with complementing sweetness from the malt. Very rich and robust smell.
Exceptional tasting. The bourbon is very prolific, but not extremely hot or boozy. The age on this is beautiful in this regard. The bourbon is followed with lots of malt sweetness. There are some woody notes along with blackstrap molasses. This is right there with Bourbon County Stout for me.
Full, soft and smooth feel. Very nice.
Overall, this has to be top three in terms of barrel aged RIS. Such a drinkable beer too. I hope I can come across this one again at some point. 748 charactersjera1350, Mar 31, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 411.5% ABV
Served in a 10 oz. Chalice like glass.
 Darkest of burnt browns upon close inspection, -bal IRS looks every bit a top notch American Imperial Stout. Came with a surprisingly good thick and creamy dark tan head that left a good amount of lacing as it dissipated, when it did.
 Smells decadent, full of chocolate and cream and hints of vanilla. No booze and no acidity. Very different from the base beer in many respects.
 Bitter chocolate and bourbon dominate the taste; in fact this is one of the most chocolaty beers ever and a worthy contender to BCBS 08. The roast has completely mellowed out and makes for a staggeringly smooth drink that gracefully goes towards a bitter heavy bittersweet finish.
 The finish is very clean, perhaps because the beer is excessively carbonated? Really, the bubbles are irritating after a point and the body seems thin as well. Even then I was digging this beer until it came to room temperature and got very very boozy. A very good beer that could have been exceptional had it been lower on carbonation, a little bigger on body, but most importantly less boozy.

Poured into a tall tulip glass a dark brown/black color with a dark reddish tinged mahagony brown head that left thick sticky lace all over the glass. The first whiff yields a strong dark chocolate aroma that fills my nose. Along with the chocolate, notes of molassess, vanilla, and slight bourbon are also evident. Medium velvety mouthfeel with ever so slight carbonation. Cocoa and chocolate are the dominant flavors along with the vanilla and bourbon. The bourbon is slight and doesn't overpower this beer. The alcohol is evident only by the warming effect it has as I drink this down. Nice, drinks way easier than it should. 741 characterskbutler1, Mar 30, 2011

2008 vintage.
A: Opaque black color with a fine ring of dark beige foam. Scant lacing remains on the glass.
S: Soft bourbon sweetness backed up by layer upon layer of chocolatey roasted malt. The bourbon is the more dominant of the components that make up this smell, but it is not harsh or particularly boozy.
T: Begins off-dry, solidly malty at first but then turning toward dark spice with an emphasis on cloves, caraway, and star anise. The middle displays a balance of chocolate, roasted grain, and bourbon, with a definite edge that is both acidic and alcoholic. The finish finds this beer turning relatively smooth and mild, with cooling herbaceous qualities.
M: Thick viscosity, coats the palate like paint early but is rapidly dispersed, with low carbonation.
D: With fluctuating flavors and a moderating smell, this beer is memorable--even epic--at its best, but it can also seem harsh on occasion. Still, this is the most drinkable version of Stone Imperial Russian Stout that I have tried to date--which seems remarkable when one considers that it is my first and only tasting of the stuff from the bourbon barrel. Those in other states that see this on more regular occasion will hopefully not take it for granted. 1,287 charactersbeagle75, Feb 12, 2011

Appearance is business as usual. Black. Some legs when swirled. A bit of a tan head that sticks around a while, which was a nice surprise.
Aroma: Huge chocolate cookie aroma. Bourbon is very present, very upfront, but also not hot - it is sweet. Reminds me a fair bit of 2010 Older Viz. Dark, dark chocolate. 
Taste: Delightful. The bourbon is well-integrated into the base beer, adding a great layer of complexity on top of the brew. Rich, dark, fudgy. No flaws to be found.
Mouthfeel is perfect for me. It's very full-bodied, a low-but-present level of carbonation, velvety. Excellent.
Drinkability was very good, considering the strength this beer was presenting.
Outstanding beer. Bottle this, please. 747 charactersdavod23, Feb 07, 2011

Taste is big, with the bourbon and chocolate up front, vanilla a toffee/brown sugar sweetness but not cloying, and char from the barrel in the middle, leading to bittersweet chocolate and a bit of resiny hops in the finish, yummy. Medium full mouthfeel, almost creamy, not a lot of effervescence. Dangerously drinkable at this ABV. This was a really good beer, one of the best I've had this year.

Listed as 10.80%, and coming out of a handle labeled as "Stone Smoked Porter Aged in Bourbon Barrels". Confusing! But I was told this is indeed the Russian Imperial Stout. 
Appearance: A very dark hickory brown, almost black. Very faint lacing, carbonated but thin head. 
Smell: Bourbon and more bourbon! Oak and vanilla. Some creamy chocolate. Gorgeous.

The beer pours the expected blackish brown color wiht very good head retention and decent lacing. On the nose, the bourbon is immediately noticeable, with hints of malt balls, dark chocolate, strong coffee and vanilla. This beer smells very, very good. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though there is some noticeable hoppy bitterness in the finish as well that helps to buoy the sweetness in this beer. There's a slight hint of alcoholic burn from the bourbon in the finish, but in a beer like this, it only adds to the attraction. Mouthfeel is full, rich and long. This is just very fine stuff. Drinkability is not this beer's best attribute of course, but this beer is so delicious, I'd still have to rate drinkabilty as fairly high.
Just an altogether excellent beer, and one very reminescent of the GIBCS stout, except with a bit more of a hop bite. Very, very nice. Might need to have a second glass of this beauty. 968 charactersJohn_M, Nov 07, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I was lucky enough to encounter this beer on tap at Brewzilla, the grand tasting of Cleveland Beer Week 2010. Served in several 5oz pours over the course of the evening. The first glass was handed to me by my friend Brian Wright, who smiled and said "enjoy". The seventh glass was handed to me by my friend Brian Wright, who frowned and said "you aren't driving tonight, are you?" For the record, no I was not, we stayed down the street!
Back to the first glass...if Steven Hawking was a beer aficionado, he may have written a book called "Behavior of particles in a 'Stone BA IRS' hole". I can almost hear his sweet robotic voice lecturing about how nothing can escape the darkness that is this beer. A beautiful cappuccino colored head is its first victim. It hangs out for a few minutes, and then gets sucked into the vortex, never to be seen again. Some lace is left behind as a reminder of what was and what will never be.
But an anomaly occurs that makes me question everything. Light has no mass, but it's still drawn into this beer due to the warping of space and time. However, apparently, the most amazing scents of roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, and coconut break free. Maybe the perfect smelling beers have no photon mass, or, maybe, the smell is more powerful than science itself!
To make this beer drinking experience even better, Mitch Steele, head brewer at Stone and a really nice guy, was on hand and served as my co-pilot on the first journey. We had a toast and I took my first sip, throttling full-blast towards the event horizon. I swear I could taste both the particles and the anti-particles; they were utterly exceptional. The roasted malt reminds me of dark chocolate and a touch of Sumatra coffee. Some caramel and dark fruit make an appearance. The wood has added touches of vanillin, coconut and just a hint of tannins. The bourbon is present but not dominant enough to eclipse any other element. The smoothness of the barrel treatment is elegant without being too weak. As it warms, it becomes a chocolate, vanilla and coconut dream.
The beer is velvet in liquid form. The body is full and the carbonation is creamy. The only problem with the mouthfeel is the touch of noticeable alcohol that breaks up the party for a split second. That being said, I enjoyed this beer more than anything I've had in the last 10 months of reviewing. That's over 415 beers since my last score this high. It's truly a stand-out and makes a legendary beer even better. I hope every beer lover has the chance to try this someday! Thanks and cheers to Mitch and Greg for sending this to Ohio and for Jay for his insight to put it at Brewzilla! Cheers, ya bunch of STONE-ers! 2,688 charactersjampics2, Nov 03, 2010

Very dark, thick black color. The Stone reps were pouring well, all of their beers had head on them which I appreciated. This one had a pretty tall dark cinnamon colored head.
Smelled like a bourbon stout all right. Decadently sweet, lots of vanilla and chocolate notes. Mild coffee. Slightly boozy in the nose. Mild oak notes and slight hints of the maltiness of the base beer.
Overall this was my second favorite bourbon stout (of the three or four) at the event. The bourbon asserts itself but balance is the name of the game here. The bourbon and oak lend lots of aid to the already wonderful IRS base beer (of which the '08 is drinking superbly on its own right now). Roasty, almost burnt maltiness with mild coffee flavors. Plenty of sweet chocolate and vanilla. Dry oakiness and bourbon flavors laced throughout. 
Slightly boozy, but not as much as 11.5% could be I suppose. Light, smooth carbonation. Drank really well, and I hope I get to have an encore tasting of this some time. 1,112 charactersSpider889, Oct 26, 2010

Smell: Big, beautiful bourbon presence on the nose marrying well with the robust dark roasted malts notes. It's altogether inviting.
Taste: From start to finish, it's a sweet, earthy roastiness stirred up with slowly melted barker's chocolate chunks, vanilla beans, burnt caramel sauce, dark brown sugar, oak wood (with some tannins breaking through), dark fruits, chilled coffee, shaved coconut and a fair share of burgeoning alcohol warmth. It's all quite bold, but it still maintains a quiet, easy-going mellowness.
Mouthfeel: Near-full body. Medium carbonation. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel.
Drinkability: Very nice. Look, I love Stone Russian Imperial Stone, but the deliciousness of the bourbon barrel version has been the highpoint of my beer drinking in the last several months. Oh, if only all the barrel-aged stouts could turn out this well. 949 charactersChainGangGuy, Oct 20, 2010

The flavor was of malt, chocolate, subtle coffee, dark chocolate, and subtle bourbon. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall it is my honest opinion that barrel aging did this brew a lot of good. The bourbon flavor mid-way through the sip pulled everything together quite nicely. Also the flavors on this one came in waves rather than just an explosion on your palate. This brew completely stole the show for me at this event and is currently my new favorite brew from Stone. Great job! 770 charactersthagr81us, Oct 12, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75From 10/04/10 notes. Had on tap at Churchkey at their Stone Total Tap Takeover event. This was the 2008 IRS aged for 12 months in bourbon barrels, and I tried it side by side with a 2004 IRS.
a - Pours a dark, dark black color with one inch of light tan head and low carbonation evident.
s - Smells of bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark fruit, roasted malts, and choolate. Smells amazing, like the normal version with some oak and bourbon. Luckily neither was overwhelming.
t - Tastes of smooth oak, bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate, and light coffee. A touch hot.
m - Medium to full body, and low carbonation. Easy to drink for the high ABV.
d - I loved this beer; I sampled 14 Stone beers and this was my favorite one. I like the normal IRS a lot, but liked this a little better. The smell was amazing to me. I thought the taste was a bit hotter than the normal IRS, but that's to be expected. Would love to try again sometime. 937 charactersmdfb79, Oct 05, 2010

Beer is black with a nice head that leaves very little lacing on the glass. Carbonation is low.
This beer only has a hint of bourbon to it and the rest is mostly sweetness.
Beer is nice, creamy, minimally bourbon but its still really good. The bourbon elevates the base beer well, I think the base is a 2008, its easy drinking and has this great sweetness to it on the front end. I would definitely have this again. 576 charactersdrabmuh, Oct 05, 2010
4.09/5  rDev -8.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Church Key today. This is the 08 IRS aged in bourbon barrels for 12 months.
Jet black with a dense dark brown head that falls off to nothing really quick. Dark brown highlights are present. The nose has great barrel character. Vanilla, bourbon and moderate heat are noticeable. Chocolate, fudge and a little cream are also present. Well integrated.
The palate opens with bourbon heat, flavors of bourbon with vanilla, almost too much, along with some oak, all of which whelm the base stout. Dry and tannic on the finish, there's more tannins than I care for. Medium-full in body with light carbonation, there's a nice blend of heat and vanilla on the finish. As I mentioned, too much tannin character for my liking, though. Solid stuff, I thoroughly enjoyed my pour 776 charactersDefenCorps, Oct 05, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4On draft at Rattle 'n Hum. I sampled only 4 brews at the 40 Taps and took review notes on three of them.
2008. 8oz pour into something between a small snifter/oversized wine glass.
The pour was a very nice dark color, minimal head and very little lacing. Bubbles at the edges of the glass. 
Aroma is overpoweringly bourbon. After letting it settle for 5-7 minutes the aroma rounds with more of the roasted malt, full bourbon, slight vanilla extract/alcohol.
The taste is similarly hot with bourbon out of the gate. There isn't much to do but let it sit for a bit and breathe (not a problem, just worth noting). I'm sure this could have breathed for a good deal longer and perhaps have warmed a bit in the glass but I didn't allow it to. The taste was exceptional. Solid bourbon flavors heavily compliment the malts. This brew still had a good deal of sweetness to it, but the bitter notes were enhanced greatly by the traces of alcohol (both obvious bourbon and faint vanilla extract). The finish was sticky but not sticky-sweet.
Mouthfeel was to be expected, very full, ominpresent on the palate from the begining of the glass through the last sip. 
It's hard to say this is highly drinkable in general. However, if what you're reaching for has to be a BBA IRS, this would certainly be one of the first I would reach for. Because I didn't allow it to breathe fully, I'm marking this a 4. However, initially it's closer to a 2.5, and with proper care it may well be a 5.

4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had on tap at the Rattle n Hum for the Total Tap Takeover Tour, so its a year 2008. Served in a wine glass.
look: jet black with no head and thin, red/brown highlights when held up to the light. There's no lacing in the glass.
Smell: the bourbon barrel vanilla and bourbon smell comes across heavily at first to the point of being almost overbearing. Behind that is the IRS smells that we all know and love... the chocolate, roasted grain and alcohol. 
Taste: probably the booziest beer I have ever had. The taste is overwhelmed by the bourbon flavor and this amplifies the taste of the alcohol. I feel as though I am drinking a black bourbon and not a beer. Behind the bourbon taste, you have hints of chocolate, vanilla, and roasted grains. The finish is the alcohol bite along with some hop bitterness but my mouth is left tasting like chocolate between sips.
Feel: medium in body, which was a surprise to me because I remember the bottled Stone Imperial Russian Stout being very thick. There's not much carbonation but just enough to remind you that this actually a beer and not really a liquor. 
Drink: I'm rating it high even though its very difficult to drink because I'm rating against the style and I have a hard time drinking any Russian Imperial Stouts and this is no exception. Its less drinkable than the regular RIS from Stone because of the bourbon flavors.
Overall, it was enjoyable but I probably wouldn't get it again. I don't think bourbon barrel aged stouts are really my thing but I'm not going to hold that against this beer. Its still very good and worth a try especially if you are a fan of Stone's Imperial Russian Stout. 1,652 charactersSkunkWorks, Oct 04, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5On tap at the Alewife for the Stone total tap takeover event on 10/1/10. 2008 Stone IRS aged in bourbon barrels. This was the beer I was most excited about trying from the list of 40 different offerings.
The color of this brew pours pretty much the same as the normal IRS; black with some lighter brown shown around the edges when held to the light. The head appears as a creamy darkly tan cap that receeds leaving leggy patches of lace along the glassware.
The aroma of this brew is sweet with a big oaky vanilla character that is so bold it is almost like a perfume. Behind the vanilla scent are notes of chocolate, roasty grain goodness and overall this is just one fine, sweet smelling brew. In the background is some mellow whiskey influence that tingles the nose with the presence of alcohol.
The taste of this brew is big and boozy with the normal presence of IRS' alcohol content being taken to the next level by the whiskey contribution. The alcohol warms the entire mouth and throat when swallowed. The heavily roasted grain comes across slightly bitter and roasty with a flavor of chocolate and some woodsy notes with a slight bit of vanilla throughout. Some bitter chocolate lingers in the mouth mingled with hops and the burn of the alcohol. It is surprising how much more concentrated the alcohol's presence is in this brew. The additional alcohol flavoring is welcomed but it hurts this brew by being outright dominating.
This is a medium bodied brew with a light, enjoyable level of carbonation. Drinkability is decent for a sipper. My initial impression of this brew was pretty much mind blowing. I absolutely loved everything about it right out the gate but as the experience continued it got to me. I would not be able to drink more than one glass of this which is difficult for me to admit because I love imperial stouts and usually enjoy barreled versions even more. I would love to try this again in a year or more to see if it calms down a bit to let the other flavors come forward. 2,009 charactersstakem, Oct 03, 2010

Pours a jet black color with a smallish tan head that settles into a light cap. The aromas are nice and quite mellow. I picked up some coffee, roasted malt, and a noticable but not strong bourbon note. The taste is the same as the aroma just better. The coffee, roasted malt and bourbon flavors mix very well together and are quite smooth and very drinkable, despite the high ABV. The stout is full bodied with some tingly carbonation; sweet all around but does finish with a roasted malt bitterness. A world class stout; great flavors in great balance. The aging worked very well with this brew. Highly recommended. 701 charactersGmann, Oct 01, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a very dark brown although not quite as dark as many imperial stouts. Pours with a creamy off white to tanish head. Not too much lacing. Smell is bourbon, oak, caramel, hints of vanilla, strong roast, and a bit of brown sugar. Quite a bit different than the standard IRS. Taste isn't quite as complex and I was let down a bit by the bourbon character that came through after a very promising nose. Feel was fairly full and seems about right; not too much heat. A nice barel-aged stout, but didn't quite live up to my expectations. 536 charactersThorpe429, Sep 28, 2010

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes, special thanks to Ineedabeerhere for bringing this to our ATSF tasting yesterday,
Appearance: Poured into a cigar city snifter, jet black with a small frothy head. Little lacing.
Smell: This is good, I get the sweet over roasted grains/soy sauce and an earthy component that separates the BA stouts from the "reg. stouts". Tons of chocolate, prunes, raisins, and a hint of licorice/anise. 
Taste: Opens with an earth and bourbon soaked raisins, the roasted malt profile is really smooth here and really brings out the dark chocolate and subtle coffee notes in the background. There is an subtle licorice profile that emerges at the finish that I didn't expect. Leaving a dark fruit and boozie aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel: I think this is what made this brew for me, medium bodied with such a complex flavor profile. Moderate carbonation and leaves a sticky film on the palate.
Drinkability: I would love to have this again, I recommend this to those seeking a solid BA RIS that doesnt carry the heavy body that most BA RIS do. 1,047 characterscapra12, May 31, 2010

A: Pours a .5 finger upward climbing mocha head with great retention. Beer is opaque and pitch black. Lacing is patchy and stringy with decent stick. 
S: Sweet soy sauce (It's been a while...), prunes, raisins, and other dry dark fruit. Barrels are apparent but linger in the background. Also chocolate, licquorice, and brownie. 
T: Sweet soy sauce and prunes. Hints of anise, chocolate, brownie, and licquorice. Bourbon barrel booziness backbone provides a great staging area for the complexities in this one. Cocoa powder towards the end with a messy finish. Aftertaste is soy sauce, chocolate, and booze. 
M: Medium to full-bodied, just the right amount of carbonation, and rather smooth and oily in the palate. For 11.5%, incredibly subtle on the palate. Finish is messy with a lingering aftertaste. 
D: Does bourbon barrel aging make everything better? I'd definitely argue against that but not in this case. Stone IRS is a great beer and this just seems infinitely better. Outstanding complexity and the barrel-aging adds a whole new dimension to this alread solid brew. A rarity but if you can, seek it out. Definitely worth the effort to try this one. 1,307 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 30, 2010

A: A jet black pour out of the growler with a sturdy tan head on top.
S: The amount of vanilla in the nose is absolutely astounding. The stout notes are still there--chocolate and roast, but the bourbon itself was somewhat muted.
T: Even more vanilla as the beer hits the tongue. Quite sweet, especially when compared to the base beer. A mild bourbon presence and some nice tannins from the barrel.
M: Quite medium to full bodied with a low, rolling carbonation. Not quite as thick and chewy as the IRS tends to be, but quite nice.
D: This one can catch up with you rather quickly. A pleasure to have been able to drink and I wish that there weren't so many beers to try so I could have enjoyed this one a bit more. 805 characterswomencantsail, May 24, 2010

Smells like the familiar background of chocolate/dark fruit/soy prune blend of IRS, with a bunch of vanilla added in. The bourbon is actually pretty muted in the aroma.
Tastes much as it smells. The Stone IRS slurry, nicely aged and blended with some bourbon and heaping amounts of vanilla. Mmm...good stuff, and clearly superior to the "regular" version.
Mouthfeel is good, though not as sludgy as some like in their RIS's. 588 charactersOverlord, May 23, 2010

Incredible aroma that is dominated by rich caramel and bourbon. The only negative is that this is a bit sweet and rich, but the molasses flavor was balanced incredibly well with the strong bourbon background and a touch of the hops. This is an incredibly smooth beer that goes down far easier than the 10.8% would indicate. An amazing beer. Doesn't get much better than this. 460 charactersChrisPro, Mar 28, 2010

A - Looks like Stone IRS. Big dark tan foam with excellent retention and lacing. Black body with a hint of brown at the fringes.
S - Milk chocolate, marshmallow, moderate bourbon barrel influence provides lots of vanilla and somewhat understated whiskey flavors. Very well balanced and integrated, with reasonably well-hidden booze.
T - The taste has more bitter dark chocolate, notes of vanilla, oak, and bourbon and the regular stout notes of dark fruit, coffee, and roasted malts. It doesn't have that slight metallic quality I pick up in the regular Stone IRS, and the bitterness is better attenuated. It's an excellent well-crafted barrel-aged stout, but didn't blow my mind like some others I've had.
M - Rich, creamy, medium-full body. A lower but sufficient amount of carbonation. Similar to the base beer and very good for the style.
D - This was an unexpected treat. It was exactly what I expected and not a disappointment at all. jw347 told me it was better when fresh, but it was quite good even after an indefinite period of time in Diego's fridge. Why don't they make more of this? 1,272 charactersMasterSki, Mar 16, 2010

Pours black with a small dark brown head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving solid lacing.
Smells of large amounts of bourbon, vanilla and butterscotch backed up by roasted malt and unsweetened chocolate flavors. They certainly didn't waste any time before throwing the beer in this barrel.
Tastes similar to how it smells, though not quite as intense. Smooth roasted malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by boozy butterscotch and lighter vanilla flavors. Midway through the sip the IRS portion of the beer asserts itself a bit more with dark chocolate and black malt flavors. Near the end of the sip the bourbon flavors take back over before a mildy bitter ending.
Mouthfeel is great. It's got a nice thickness with smooth and soft carbonation.
Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and went back for a few more. Very easy-drinking for such a big ABV.
Overall this was one of the beers I was most excited about and it didn't disappoint. Well worth a shot if you see it around. 1,052 charactersglid02, Mar 01, 2010

The color is a dark black with a finger or deep brownish head with some nice lacing left on the glass.
The smell is pretty strong and kicks right out with a deep bourbon flavor that leads into a toasty woody flavor. Some coffee and toffee flavor all seem to be just in the background.
The taste of this beer the same as the aroma. The Whiskey flavor lets it's presence known with a nice warm flavor that encases the maple flavor that tryst to come through. A nice Oak flavor is there is the flavor with a nice coffee or espresso flavor.
The feel of this beer is big, a heavy ABV gives off a very warm slightly deep flavor and mouthfeel. For a beer on the stronger side it does feel smoother than expected. 751 charactersDuhast500, Feb 25, 2010

Pours a nearly black color with an uber-dark brown foam. Moderate retention and lacing. Good looking brewski.
Smell is utterly ridiculous. Vanilla infused whiskey, peanut butter and Nilla wafers. Not much hops but still manages to be mighty complex. Chocolate drizzled Little Debbie Nutty Bars are what this mutha smells like...yea, with some shaved coconut topping! Great nose here.
Very tasty coconut-wood-vanilla flavor with some tannic bourbon in there. Bourbon/whiskey notes come out to play more as I sip upon the glass as opposed to fading more and more into the background. Hop bitterness and even a touch of hop flavor creeps in at the end. There is the omnipresent malt sweetness that is well balanced with the roasty malt aspect. Couple more years and this thing will most likely be pure bliss! Overall it is a pretty boozy, bittersweet chocoholic treat, isn't that what we want in a bourbon barrel aged RIS? 1,064 characterstwiggamortis420, Feb 21, 2010

A: Pours an opaque black color. A one finger tan head forms, and recedes to a ring that sticks around. Light lace is left behind.
S: Sweet vanilla is up front and dominate. Roasted malt and chocolate follows. Warm bourbon lingers. 
T: Sweet vanilla and chocolate again. Warm bourbon is a little to prevalent. Good but a little one dimensional.
M/D: A full body that is low on the carbonation. Smooth and creamy. Plenty of hot alcohol. A slow sipper.
A little one dimensional. One thing I look for in a barrel aged beer is a big dry oak character, and I really did not get any here. This seems like it needs at least another year to be great. Still very enjoyable, and something I would recommend if you find some. 802 characterschamp103, Feb 18, 2010

This insanely rich beer hold all of the greatness of the original, Pitch black, dense viscosity, and slow simmering carbonation. The beer patiently releases a very dense sheet of mocha foam that favors brandy-style legging over meaningful lace. The beer intimidates, just by its glare.
Rich and sultry aromas of Belgian chocolate, whipping cream, bold roast coffee, singed toffee, and walnut exude from the glass with mouth watering and calming effects. Bourbony alcohols accompany toasted oak, vanilla and caramel- all becoming more pronounced as the beer warms and unlocks its powerful scents.
And so go the beer's flavor... with its light carbonation, all the savory goodness of espresso, brownie batter, bittersweet chocolate, deep caramel, and malted milkshake seep into the mouth with awe-inspiring effects. Nothing short of amazing, the flavors trend toward walnut-type bitterness that links into oak, vanilla, cherry wood, light sherry, and unmistakable bourbon to round out the finish. Even notes of chocolate covered raisins introduce themselves with alternating sips.
Rich, dense and truly sultry on the palate, the stout's creamy viscosity delivers a pleasant weight that melds into the mouth and seems to seduce the taste buds. Warm alcohols balance its weight in finish to provide an extended finish and infinite aftertaste.
Of course this '08 version is now in its 5-years of maturation so the savory notes and low rate of carbonation are more prominent than when younger, but its incredible power in flavor and effects is something rarely experienced in the beer world. Its such a digestive that it will surely compare favorable with the best tawny ports, cognac, brandy, or scotch. 1,775 charactersBEERchitect, Sep 20, 2009

Pours like used motor oil with a dense one-inch brown head. Huge nose on this one with a big bourbon aroma to complement vanilla, chocolate, brown sugar and roasted malts. Bourbon hits even harder in the taste then eases into the roasted malts and smeet molasses and vanilla before finishing with a slight coffee bitterness and, of course, the bourbon. Mouthfeel is super smooth with the bourbon really making its presence felt on the tongue. This is one big mother of a beer and I am glad I was given the opportunity to try it. Definitely a sipper, but a damn fine one. 649 charactersgford217, Aug 07, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap at Stone Bistro for RBSG 08. Black color with black coffee highlights. Mocha head, moderate lacing. Brownie mix aroma with a huge, appealing bourbon note. Flavors of cocoa powder, dark chocolate, graham cracker, and smooth bourbon. No alcohol whatsoever. Very clean and surprisingly light on the palate. Mousse-smooth mouthfeel with a short burnt coffee finish. 368 charactersillidurit, Aug 06, 2008

Pours Dark black with a short lived tan head. Smell is bourbon, chocolate and a slight doughy-ness along with a bit of vanilla. Tastes is rich and chocolatey, with some bitterness. Light vanilla flavor and balanced light bourbon flavor too. Medium to full bodied with moderate to light carbonation. Solid mouthfeel. I liked this way better than the non-BA version. 433 charactersJDV, Jul 01, 2008

A careful pour produces a half-finger thick, brown tinged, darker tan colored head. The beer is pitch black and color and quite opaque. Ample, spicy Bourbon aromas are noticeable without completely drowning out the Stout aromatics. Roast espresso aromas, charred prune notes, bit roast grain and a finish dominated by deeply toasted grain notes that lean towards toasted, not quite burnt whole grain bread. The aroma has some sweetness to it, that is accentuated just a bit by the Bourbon-alcohol aromas. When intensely scrutinizing the aroma the Bourbon notes are big up front, but then disappear and allow that pure stout notes to come through, but then things start to meld together as toasted barrel notes of coconut , vanillin mix with dark, rich, sweet malty chocolate aromas. This has a very nice aroma to it, much better than I was expecting as the Bourbon barrel notes are quite well integrated; the Imperial stout aromatics are still allowed to shine here & really show quite well as they mix with the barrel notes.
Fairly thick and viscous up front, the beer gets a bit thinner towards the finish as some boozy, Bourbon notes kick in. Creamy feeling with a huge, richly, dark malt sweetened, chocolate flavors are accentuated by the barrel with flavors of vanillin, a light coconut note and a rich, burnt fruit character. This last reminds me of a mix of deeply roasted, burnt, succulent figs, moist prunes and raisins. While not overly thick or viscous this really has an unctuous, creamy fullness that just engulfs the palate; when warmed up a bit it even manages to over-power the thinning effect of the Bourbon booze in the finish. When cooler the hop and roast grain notes combine to give this beer a substantial, but sometimes overlooked, bitterness.
The bitter, burnt roast notes are what really define this beer; not necessarily in the way you might think though as these notes are very well integrated and never allowed to become harsh, sharp nor astringent. Instead the roast character plays an almost supporting role (if you can imagine such a thing in an Imperial Stout), creating a rich, roast malt depth & balancing act that provides touches of bitterness, a light roast acidity and a deep black coffee note that serves as a light foil to the sweet, concentrated, chocolate like, thick malt character that is so nice in this beer. The texture, especially, really starts to come in to its own as the beer warms up; the boozy Bourbon notes that thinned out the finish are tamed and this beer remains a creamy, viscous, palate enveloping experience from the start to long, lingering finish of each sip. Even the aroma gets increasingly better as it warms up; accentuating more of the chocolate, toasted coconut and vanillin notes.
This is far better than I was expecting; I had thought I was burnt out on Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stouts, but this shows I just need a nice, well balanced example to keep me interested in the style. Perhaps just a touch too boozy in the finish, this beer otherwise is a classic example of the marriage of Bourbon and Imperial Stout. I really did not expect to love this; I assumed that at most I might find it interesting and slightly enjoyable, instead this is just down right tasty & easily the best use of a Bourbon barrel in a beer that I have had. Stones Imperial stout requires some age on it to be at its best, this beer manages to display those characteristics as well as an added boost of complexity from the Bourbon barrel that was not overdone. I almost feel guilty for liking this beer as much as I do, especially since I was expecting to be able to easily tear it down. This really needs to be served on the warm side of cool; it started out at 50°F / 10°C, but still really becomes phenomenal the longer I wait. I have about a half ounce left and it seems to be at its best after sitting in my glass for the last hour and a half; damn there it goes, unexpectedly I am left wanting more. 3,994 charactersGueuzedude, Jun 14, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Hand bottle from thickerfreakness...thanks!
This one is right up my alley! It poured black in color with a think brown head that faded rather quickly. The nose is filled with crème, hazelnuts, coconut, milk chocloate, vanilla and some woodiness at the end. In the mouth it was full-bodied and quite rich with a sweetness that is wonderfully balanced by just enough grip. The finish lingers on and on with flavors of chocolate dipped hazelnuts. In fact, especially in the finish, this reminds me of a wonderful mignardises to end a great meal...and this can be treated the same! 579 charactersSQNfan, Jun 13, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this yesterday at O'Brian's... fresh from Stone. Served in a pint glass, dark licorice brown (near black) with a small cocoa-brown cap. Very low in carbonation ofcourse.
Smell was strong of liquour, prunes, licorice with some notable smokiness. The acoholic fumes disperse flavor aplenty, gotta taste it!
BIG, dark rich flavorsome maltiness fills the mouth. Black licorice, prune, dark fig, black grape, molassas, bit-o-chocolate, wood, smoke in a somewhat chewy, sweet concoction. The complexity is marvelous and the balance is unique, very sweet overall. This stuff has massive flavor that just makes you want more, no joke.
Big body, it's a sipper for sure. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and creamy and plenty of alcohol (10% ABV+) that warms your inside.
A very delicious stout that makes the bottled stuff almost seem bland by comparison (though it's far from bland). Another great BIG beer made even better (and bigger) from who else? Stone silly! Cheers to another great beer! 1,001 charactersscottoale, May 19, 2006
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.504/01/06- On cask at the Triple Rock 3rd Annual Firkin Fest in Berkeley, CA.
Presentation- 8 or 9oz sampler glass filled to the rim. What a pour! From the wooden cask straight into the glass. Not sure what year this is from.
Appearance- Deep chocolaty brown in color with a 1/4 inch dirty brown head. Large streaks and chunks of lace left behind.
Smell- This is one rich smelling beer. Notes of hard alcohol (assuming that's the bourbon), lots of chocolatly goodness, semi-bitter hops and deep roasted malt. Smells like dessert.
Taste- Wow! I wasn't thinking I was going to like this since I was told it had lots of licorice flavor, which I am usually not very keen on. Very smooth and creamy right off the bat. A big hit of licorice comes into play, but it works wonders with the other flavors. Large chocolate (both milk and dark) swirl and mix together. Very sweet in flavor. Nice heavy bourbon note as well upon the first sip. Hops are there and make themselves know quickly as well. But, the overpowering flavor is the wonderful chocolate, roasted malt and licorice. I had to have another pour before I left and thus am paying for it now with a headache.
Mouthfeel- Rich, smooth and creamy with the slightest of carbonation. This would be one kick ass after dinner drink!
Drinkability- I have no idea what the abv is on this brew, but assume it's gotta be at least 10%. So, glad I got to try this wonderful brew and hope it eventually comes back soon. 1,474 charactersGClarkage, Apr 02, 2006
