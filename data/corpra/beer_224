This one pours a light orange-ish, slightly hazy, with a small head, and lots of lacing.
Smells like soft peach, grapefruit, orange zest, and a little bit of pine.
This feels a tiny bit muddled, but it's still very taste. For comparison purposes, I liked the Apprentice better for sure. There's definitely some nice Nelson character here, with huge citrus and slight grape. There's a bit of bitter orange zest and lots of grapefruit, too. The flavors don't pop as much as I'd want, but it's still nice.
This is light bodied, pretty soft,  not quite as crisp as expected. There's a normal level of carbonation.
This is not the best of the small sample of beers I've had from this brewery. It's still very enjoyable, though. 792 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 24, 2017

A: Straw colored with some bright white persistent head.

Glass: Tall, clear, slender glass
From: Societe Brewing in San Diego, Calif. 
Price: $3
Purchased: July 8, 2016
Consumed: July 8, 2016
Misc.: N/A
Had this once before and thought it was decent (3.75 on Untappd), but nothing special. Snuck over to Societe after dropping something off for work and heading to a local hospital quick to review a quick one. Hoping this would be better than I originally had it.
Poured a golden yellow, clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of frothy white head when I got it. Lots of bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Good spotty lacing. Above average retention. (Sight - 3.75)
Smelled nice and tropical up front, specifically guava and mango. Also floral hops, Nelson-like and Citra. First part of sell was great, but it thinned out rather quickly. (Smell - 4.25)
Taste wasn’t quite as good as the nose, but still followed it. Got dry tropical hops mango, bitter tropical rind, guava, Citra, spicy (Simcoe or Amarillo), hints of Nelson, resin and lemon zest. (Taste - 4.00)
Light-to-medium body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt bitter finish. Goes down nice. (Feel - 4.25)
A very good IPA, even better than I thought it would be. (Overall - 4.00)

4.19/5  rDev -5.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes.
A: Slightly hazy golden with short cap of nearly white head with a few thin stripes of lacing.
S: Plenty of berry and tropical fruit with a soft pale maltiness that is slightly grainy.
T: Flavor is nuanced and complex with a controlled dose of berry, tropical fruit like pineapple and passionfruit along with some of the usual citrus suspects like grapefruit and orange. Lush without being heavy and accented with a straightforward pale malt grain flavor riding underneath. Bitterness is low-medium.
M: Light and refreshing despite its ABV heft. Medium carbonation.
O: A really nicely crafted WCIPA -- Societe should be proud of this effort. I would drink a lot of this if I lived in SD even with all of the good options around. Impressive beer. 845 charactersargock, Jul 02, 2016

Citra and nelson are two of my favorite hop varieties.
This brew gives thats tropical and citrus fruit notes but also the signature Australian zesty hop bite. Not overpowering with bitterness but bery balanced. So glad my local bbq spot has this offering! 288 charactersSaulFox, May 22, 2016

Light citrus and pine aroma with the aromas transfering to the taste but less so. Decent IPA, to bad for this beer I just came from Alpine Brewing. 212 charactersLXIXME, Dec 19, 2015

Taste just crushes your face with hop flavor without the bitterness.  Super dry and light malt bill, hence the yellow.  Citrus and tropical fruit, wave after wave come crashing in.   If I lived here, I would get a growler of this every weekend. 409 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 16, 2015

Served in a pint glass
Nearly crystal clear, brassy yellow appearance. The beer was topped by a one finger tall, frothy, bright white cap that faded to a lasting ring. Streaky, drippy lacing trickled along the glass.
The aroma was solid but a bit more muted than I anticipated. White grapefruit dominated. Lemon and lemongrass notes also came through. Bit of tropical fruitiness. Passionfruit was detectible.
The flavor profile was more punchy and interesting than the nose. Super hoppy with loads of white grapefruit and lemon. Lots of lemongrass as well. Fairly tart for the style. Moderately dank. Good amount of tropical fruitiness. Passionfruit again was most noticeable. Lemon rind appeared in the finish. All in all, really nicely balanced.
Solid mouthfeel. The beer was medium to lighter bodied for the style and contained a fine, subtle effervescence. Creamy, smooth and pillowy soft on the palate.
The Pupil is definitely an ode to Nelson Sauvin hops and, in my book, that is certainly a good thing. This reminded me a lot of Alpine Brewing's Nelson. 1,113 charactersDamian, Aug 17, 2015
3.98/5  rDev -10.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.75The aroma offers bready malt, pine, resin, grapefruit, very malty on the aroma. Reminiscent of some breadier IPA like from 3 Floyds or Pipeworks.
The flavor follows of grapefruit, lots of bready malt, a medium sweetness, drying pine and grass on the finish. It's a clean brew, but a relatively unexciting IPA from a bygone era. 328 charactersdar482, Aug 17, 2015

4.65/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75From the growler, which was filled the night before last. 
A: Transparent and yellow with a good amount of visible carbonation. There's also a good amount of lacing on the glass. It looks a little deceiving as the appearance resembles a lager with lacing.
S: I can smell a pleasant mixture of hops (smells like nelson-sauvon and citra). Some fruitiness mixed with dankness... I love it. 
T: This IPA tastes fantastic. The hop flavors come rushing forward without overwhelming the palate. This smells like it tastes, but more amplified. Wonderful!
M: A light, crisp, dry mouth feel that I love in IPAs (much like all their IPAs). A good amount of carbonation which goes perfectly with that dank, nelson flavor that I love. 
O: This is one of my favorite IPAs in San Diego. Every time I stop by Societe, I fill 2 growlers (their growlers are awesome, by the way). This beer is reminiscent of a few VT beers I've had, but slightly less juicy and more dialed down. I wish I could get this in cans, but I'm always happy to stop by the brewery to get my fill. If you're ever in San Diego, get this beer! 1,106 charactersfuhnoo, Jun 23, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. 
The pour is a very light yellow, like that big ball of fire in the sky we haven’t seen in weeks during a Minnesota February. Lacy, if you care about that sort of thing. Big tropical fruit & citrus nose puts me on notice: this ain’t no Midwest IPA. It whispers sweetly…nothings? Let’s see. 
The Pupil I wasn’t digging after a couple of sips, but opens up like a Silversun Pickups album after a few sips. Rough pineapple & mango assault the senses immediately, stunning the tongue into silence & confusion. After a pause to collect my taste buds, I go back in. The fruit is followed by a bracing bitterness that scours the mouthskin like steel wool. Good, loving steel wool. And the bitterness just builds from there, until I’m casting about for a palate cleanser. So good, this is the one Societe beer that I went back for more. Mmmmm. 
At first I thought this was a slow kid zone, but as it warmed, this beer gained mad respect. Anybody who can get the bright fruit & a wicked bitterness knows what they’re doing. Excellent & very close to world-class. 1,273 charactersmaximum12, Feb 21, 2015

Nelson Sauvin hops give the beer a settle rye like spice.  Strong citrus and floral notes. Beautifully balanced with a crisp clean maltyness.  If you are lucky enough to find yourself in the middle of the epic San Diego beer scene, grab one of these as a classic example of the West Coast Style IPA. You will not be disappointed! 400 charactersKelmcl, Feb 08, 2015

Big pungent tropical fruit and citrus nose, with a blend of pineapple, mango, ripe tangelos, juicy, tangy and fragrant, intense and pure in expression. The palate is rather devoid of malt, focusing instead on the resiny and pungency that hops can bring(yay!), intensely fruity and moderately bitter. Long, drying, resiny finish with really oily Minneola-like fruity, tangy, brightness. Most excellent. 448 charactersDefenCorps, Jan 01, 2015

About as clear a beer as you can have with a nice head that holds up well.  The nose is huge tropical fruit - in addition to the mango and pineapple notes, I dug out guava to go along with the fantastically balanced hops.  Clearly several hop additions going on with this beer given the complex yet subtle flavors happening here.  Mouth feel is perfect.  All in all a lovely beer. 449 charactersmschantz, Dec 27, 2014
4.99/5  rDev +12.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my first review and I'm starting off with a stellar beer from my current favorite Brewery in California. I'm going to keep this straight and to the point for now.
Appearance: substantially clear and transparent. You can see right through this clean, beautiful beer. Moderate white head. Thins out quickly.
Aroma: this aroma really does put you in a coma. The smell is pure ecstasy. Tropical as hell. I smell Mango, pineapple, fresh hops, some citrus. I'm not even sure what else but it's incredible. Best nose a beer can emit. 
Taste: Flawless. Balanced masterfully. I don't know how Travis and Doug do it. 7.5% ABV is concealed in an excellent fashion. This beer is utter bliss to my taste buds. I'm not going to lie, I don't know all the hop varieties that compose this beer but they are an incredible combination. I love the piney goodness and the bitterness level is hit right on the nail for this one. Of course there is some citrus and grapefruit notes. Not sure how the taste could improve much more.
Mouthfeel: oral orgasm. smooth. silky. yummy. dry crisp finish. 
Overall: I cannot say enough great things about this beer. It's overall the type of beer I seek and it's a shame its not very easy to find in Orange County, particularly Irvine where I reside. This beer has everything I look for in a quality craft beer: quality hop flavor, not so much weird maltiness that can distract from the hop and pine action and perfect medium carbonation and mouthfeel. The Apprentice is also ridiculously tasty and amazing but I feel the Pupil might be ever so slightly better. (pretty much a tie)
Go to Societe in San Diego pronto!!!
These guys and Alpine are the best breweries in SoCal. 1,703 charactersluisitoelmatador88, Dec 26, 2014

A- Clear yellow, with a hint of orange and copper hue, half finger white head with nice retention time and lots of lacing. It looks especially refreshing.
S- Clean pine and grapefruit aromas, very minimal pale malt dryness. Not grainy or overly sweet. Just clean hoppiness. Not complicated at all, which I appreciate.
F- Citrus, grapefruit, pine. Straight up hops, with a very basic pale malt backbone acting as a blank canvas for the hop additions. Bitter pine on the finish that isn't resinous at all. It is all hop flavour rather than hop resins.
M- Medium bodied, although on the thinner side. Finishes very dry, as expected of the west coast style. Bitter pine finish that is clean without the resinous nature that a lot of beers bring.
O- Very nice example of the West Coast style IPA. Clean hoppiness with minimal resin and high attenuation, leaving a bone dry finish that remains refreshing. Very nice IPA.

S: Bright citrus and mango up front, followed by a hint of pine. More nondescript sweet tropical fruit as it warms. Very well put together nose, not overly potent, but extremely well composed.
T: Sweet citrus and tropical fruit once again, layered with dry crackery malt. Gentle bitterness in the finish. Damn this is drinkable. No trace of the ABV.
M: Bone dry and light bodied with a soft carbonation. Perfect vehicle for the succinct flavors. 
O: A refined and subtle take on a style that generally is an effing sledgehammer in this part of the country. An exercise in balance and drinkability rather than blow your doors off flavors and bitterness. I could literally drink this all day and can't believe the ABV is as high as it is.

A: Served a light clear golden straw color with a greasy bright white head that faded into a faint scum. Great sticky rings of lace were left down the glass.
S: Passion fruits and tropical hop notes are strong. There's also some slight wintergreen mint and something more herbal. Very fruity smelling. 
T: Huge tropical fruit nectar hops follow the nose. Very juicy, sweet, and fruity. There's a touch of pale grainy malt in the finish, but not much. I also get flavors of mango, tangerine, and touch of pepper. The aftertaste is slightly herbal and maybe minty, but overall the fruit lingers all the way through. 
M: Very clean with a drying finish; medium body with a nice greasy hop oiliness to it. Smooth and subtle carbonation. Not especially bitter. 
O: An amazing ipa, and one of the better ones I've had in recent memory. I would love to drink this often. 902 charactersscottfrie, Oct 20, 2014

The beer pours a hazy, golden straw color, surprisingly opaque with a thick white head, about a finger or so with great retention and nice lace. The aroma is super juicy, plenty of tropical fruity hops, honey, citrus, mostly grapefruit peel with a bit of tangerine juiciness, bitterness is light and it has a nice floral character as well. The flavors are wonderful, big, juicy hops, pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, dank wildflower and grassy earthiness, not too bitter, not too dry, with a soft, doughy malt backbone. The body is nice, sticky, juicy and coats the mouth super well, perfect carbonation that finishes fairly dry, but not too bitingly so.
Verdict: A wonderful IPA from Societe, very reminiscent of a Hill Farmstead IPA, rustic, juicy and lightly malty that doesn't detract from the hops at all. It's refreshing, complex and very well balanced, a lovely IPA. 989 characterskevanb, Jun 08, 2014

App- Super light like a hazy wheat beer with a nice big white head. I am really surprised by the color on this one. A good head with frothy white bubbles. A good amount of sticky cling.
Smell- Tropical fruits and wheaty hops. The aroma is very light with the almost wheat beer esque aroma taking over. I get some pineapple, some wheat, some grass and a little bit of lemon peel on the nose.
Taste- I have noticed the last few IPAs I have had have been on the smaller flavor profile but wonderfully layered. I like how this has the tropical fruits with the pineapple, mango and lemon. The balance of the wheat and hops are striking to me. I like the flavor on this one. Different is definitely good. 
Mouth- A smaller medium body with a medium carbonation level on this. The residual flavors of wheat, pineapple and lemon peel are quite nice. A smaller grassy flavor remains as well. 
Drink- I can say this is one of a kind. A full growler IMO is the way to go. A glass just doesnt cut it really. I was very glad I made the trek back down to try this one. I will be sure to bring my growler back. 1,149 charactersFosterJM, Jun 01, 2014

A-Very hazy yellow straw with almost 1/2 finger head but yet leaves a nice lacing. 
S-Mango, light tropical fruits, and oranges. This carries a seductive smell but found it rather weak and you really got to work the nose. 
T-Oranges and mangos strike first, light cotton candy and a hint of pine bitterness towards the end. 
M-Light pretty much all the way around with a hint of bitterness.
O-Very excellent IPA they need I bottle this stuff! 471 charactersreebtaerG, Apr 11, 2014

Smell is slightly dank and grassy with some light fruityness. On the whole the aroma is mild but very pleasant. Taste again has that earthy, grassy hop character with some tropical fruit flavors mixed in. Bitterness is there, especially in the dry finish but it doesn't overpower at any point. Body is light but not watery at all. Overall an amazing IPA with a ton going on in the flavor department but one you can enjoy anytime without your palette being completely wrecked. Awesome beer! 597 charactersBreweryRun, Feb 18, 2014

S - Mostly pineapple and other tropical fruits. Some subtle sour grapefuit. Pine and Douglas fir as well.  Aroma is the best part of this beer.
T - Smooth, lots of interesting flavor, great interplay between the different hops. Slight welcome bitterness at first with a hint of sour and funk.  Gets more bitter and has an off flavor of onions as you drink it. Totally unique flavor profile though. No noticeable alcohol. 
M - Not a very full body but its perfect for this style of IPA. Just so smooth, perfect carbonation. No harsh bitterness anywhere. 
O - Very unique IPA. I was kind of disappointed in the appearance at first and again with the onion off flavor at the end. However, its a great beer overall.

Pupil is definitely one of my favorite IPAs and I was stoked at the opportunity to have it at my local spot. Pours a beautiful golden amber color with very thin white head that disappeared pretty quickly. Pure fruity hops on the nose with a subtle notes guava. Crisp and clean on each sip, full of complex hop/fruit flavors. No alcohol tings despite the ABV. 
No doubt I ended up getting three more pours. 471 characterscornejo, Dec 12, 2013

Served from 64oz growler (big thanks to Sarge3130 for sharing)
A - looks like a hazier pineapple juice, light head which faded quickly
S - unbelievable, huge citrus, mango and pineapple bomb. The pineapple stood out the most and I wish they would make an air freshener with this aroma
T - soft and incredibly smooth. Very slight bitterness without it punching you in the face. One if the best IPA's I've had
M - medium carbonation, just wonderfully crafted! 
O - i don't enjoy many IPA's in general, but this was incredible. Perfectly balanced with amazing flavor. I wish I had better access to these guys, and will certainly be seeking them out in future trades 727 charactersrhong187, Nov 13, 2013

Sweet and spicy, and I'd go so far as to call it rich. It tastes even stronger than the ABV, more like a Double IPA, and it seems more substantial than the usual thin and harsh IPAs. Amazing spicy notes keep coming up. The aroma is sensational and carries over into each sip. It does get rather bitter, though it's hard to complain too much as this stuff is so full of flavor. 590 charactersmactrail, Oct 30, 2013

Pours a very hazy, pale golden straw yellow color with banana hues and a 1.5 finger frothy, pillowy white head.  Nice retention, slowly settling into a thick, lasting ring.  The pint is left coated with streaks of soapy lacing. 
Dank floral hop aroma with grassy pine and a ton of tropical/citrus fruit.  Pale biscuity malt backbone with cracker, bread and light fruit.  Resinous oils, dank buds and pine followed by hints of grapefruit, pineapple and lemon peel.  The earthy and sweet hop notes are countered by biscuit, bread and graham cracker.  
Medium bodied with a crisp, spicy hop bite that lingers throughout.  The mouthfeel is perfect. Light enough to pound  yet a touch creamy with a complex hop profile and subtle pale malt presence. Dry, dank and bitter up front with a perfect fruit presence.  Not overly tropical/citrusy like some other WCIPAs but just enough for great balance.  Some pineapple and grapefruit sweetness along with subtle citrus rind.  Pale malt backbone with biscuit, bread and cracker flavors that don't interfere with the fresh hop character.  This is a great IPA that very refreshing and easy to drink without giving up any complexity.  I would drink this beer all of the time given the chance. 1,303 characterscorby112, Oct 23, 2013

a - brew poured a semi transparent yellow with a thin fizzy head that didn't last long...definitely carbonated though (which i was slightly concerned about since the growler leaked a bit in transit (when i opened it there was about an ounce of space, but opened with lots of pressure).
s - in a word dank. resiny. pine coney. tropical...thick and rich.
t - WOW! i mean !!!!WOW!!!! again dank freshness. tropical thickness. resin. pine cones. just fantastic. the definition of a west coast ipa. just amazing.
m - nice subtle bitterness and a rich body. fairly dank, but not overdone.
o - overall, this is impressive. this one hangs with the big boys. for a single ipa, i can't think of many beers that hit it as spot on as this one. 973 characterscosmicevan, Sep 08, 2013

Started with the stout which was fantastic and then moved on to the Pupil. 
Nothing to exotic on the color, nice yellowish mellow orange. Two inches of head and excitement all around me. The smell was a nice fruity tropical mellow pine. The taste.... wow, damn, holy smokes. There is virtually no malt and rich tropical fruit, mango, guava just lingering on the taste buds. Moderate/perfect carbonation and an incredible mouthfeel that leaves you begging for more. I just couldn't stop drinking it. It reminds me of Pliny mixed with the first generation of Sculpin that was heavy in tropical fruit.
This is something very special. When they start bottling I will unfortunately be making the 100 mile trek weekly. Must try for any IPA lover. 819 charactersOneBeertoRTA, Sep 03, 2013

A: LIght golden hazy color. Creamy white head. Tons of lacing left in the glass. No carbonation problems at all.

M: Medium/full bodied with a crisp, dry finish. Pleasant carbonation. 
O: One of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of trying. Nice use of Nelson, a hop that's quickly becoming one of my favorites. 583 charactersstandardcherry, Aug 27, 2013

A: Pours a light gold, slightly murky, with one full finger of fluffy white head. The foam takes forever to settle, and thee is a ton of lacing as this bee drinks. The look of this beer is stunning.
S: The nose is really nice. Fresh hop vegetal, pine, and lime citrus. Really nice.
T: It starts off wet and refreshing with some really nice fresh hop flavor. It's bright and crisp with muted vegetation. As it moves to the back end, it gets sweet while simultaniously bringing out lime citrus and pine notes. The finish is big hops, but nothing astringent or burning.
M: Light bodied beer. Light and refreshing to start, hoppy and assertive, but not overwhelming. Super drinkable IPA. You'd think the abv of this beer was significantly less than 7.5%.
O: I am a fan. This beer is super drinkable, packed with delicious favor, and it looks beautiful. This one is a winner. I wish I could have more of this in my life. 964 characterstrxxpaxxs, Aug 17, 2013

T: A nice dry, super clean citrusy note upfront with some tropical fruit, light dank and some pine needles. This beer is very fresh and immensely flavorful. It is dry from start to finish with a slight dry bittering hop profile. The booze is light and well masked, barely even noticed it. 
M: Lighter bodied, all hops here, well carbonated. The plate and mouthfeel is once again all sorts of fruits. No slickness here. This beer is very clean which makes it so enjoyable. 
O: This IPA was fantastic. Easy to drink and clean. One thing I always love about HF IPAs is the cleanliness and clarity of their beers. This beer has that just on a different coast. Well crafted! 933 charactersbarleywinefiend, Jul 01, 2013

Aroma is one of subtlety: the hops are front and center though not aggressive. Amazing nose is Hawaiian pineapples with a touch of pine needle. Perhaps one of the most subtle and mouthwatering aromas an IPA can produce.
Taste is of carbonated pineapple juice infused with fresh pine: a real treat in every respect. Quality hops are beautifully showcased here. Little to nothing to improve on in the taste department.
Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, impressive carbonation (particularly for being shipped cross country in a growler), fabulous bitterness rests on the back of the palate. Dry and crisp, no malty overload to get in the way of the hops. Never degenerates into that "crackery" session IPA aftertaste, and the 7.8% abv is masterfully obscured. This is one that every fan of "tropical tasting" IPAs should get their hands on, and considered to be a Southern Cali masterpiece in my book. 1,054 charactersHendry, Jun 23, 2013

T - One of a few IPA's where the taste actually exceeds the smell. Tons of citrus and tropical fruit along with some pine and bitter herb flavor. The bitterness is so well integrated. Probably the most balanced IPA I've had. 
M - Bitterness is present but not overpowering. Smooth mouthfeel and nice, lingering finish. 
O - This is the most enjoyable IPA I've had the pleasure of drinking. You can only get it on tap or to go in a growler so I've only had it super fresh. Simply the cleanest, purest flavors. I could easily knock back an entire growler just because it is so enjoyable to drink. World class. 792 charactersEliotRosewater, Jun 15, 2013

S: Awesome freshness that you look for in a good IPA. I cannot pick up the different hop types but there is a nice balance of freshness and depth. 
T: Surprisingly one of my favorite IPA based solely on the taste. I get a hit of pine, slight Belgium mustiness, and citrus. It was difficult for me to slow down to sip this one
M:It is a full mouthfeel with medium carbonation. It sits a little heavier than some IPAs but still stellar.
O: While on a Stone tour and talking about different Hops a few of the induction specialist said this brewery was a must go while in San Diego; It did not disappoint. This was my favorite of the 8 IPAs they had on the menu. Overall the IPA here were AMAZING and worth a visit if in the area since they currently are not outside of San Diego.

The pupil is everything that it wants to be, but unfortunately, isn't. On Raul's "aite scale," it's just straight up, aite. A lil hoppy, a lil fruity, a lil just aite. Hell, like Jennifer Anistan in a thong, yeah, I'll peep it, but in the end, meh.
*Re-Review*
Raul enjoyed this bad boy again at Toronado and he is going to call this the "Manny Paciio" of beers. Good, damn good, but he ain't no Floyd Mayweather. Think of this as Nelson's lil brother; super fruity and juicy, but he definitely ain't no FULL Nelson.

Taste - Bright resiny hop, a bit more citrus here. Some slightly grainy malts back there, almost no sweetness. Dry bitter finish.
Mouthfeel - Dry, medium bodied, low carbonation. That's probably the growler. I could drink a few glasses of this.
Overall - I don't love the hop profile, but I can't deny that it's a very well made IPA. 581 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 03, 2013

Golden with a slight haze, dense white head and sufficient lace. Aroma is a bit muted, tropical fruit with floral notes. Very non-West Coast flavor, guava, pomelo, citrus rind to start and an earth bitterness to finish. Lively mouthfeel with a medium body. Leans toward the dry side with a touch of alcohol present. 362 charactersLittleDon, Mar 13, 2013
4.67/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On tap at the Societe taproom. My only Citra-heavy beer before this was ZD, so I was looking forward to this one.
Half-inch of fluffy white head, yellow - orange hazy appearance. Very appealing.
Lots of citrus fruit and of course, hops jumping out at you. Honestly I was too eager to taste it than spend a lot of time smelling it - it just smelled good...
Still learning the different hop flavors, but the Citra is now recognizable to me, and stood out immediately. Very tropical, a light malt backbone, just enough bitterness to remind you its an IPA, no booze. Fairly clean finish. Very smooth - could drink a few of these.
Medium carbonation, pretty light body - nothing unexpected after the aroma and taste.
Wish I had more than one, but I was visiting from out of town and wanted to try their other offerings. Visited a few other places in SD, and this was definitely the best beer I had during a short 3-day stay. 924 charactershopjake, Mar 12, 2013

4.83/5  rDev +9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Drank this on tap at Churchill's in November 2012, then at the Societe taproom in February 2013.
Big time yellow pour, tons of haze, small 1/3" head on the top. Some of these mega hopped SD west coast ipa's now look eerily similar to a hefeweizen (albeit without the same head, lacing or retention).
Aroma, huge, the best of both worlds, you get the citra and the nelson hops in all their glory. Name the fruit, you can probably close your eyes and envision it in this beer. Mango, guava, pine, pineapple. Pretty much every tropical type of fruit out there, comes out in the nose (and taste, but more about that in a sec). I smelled the shit out of this beer, ramping up expectations until I could actually taste it. 
The taste is very smooth, for all the hop glory in this, it has zero abrasive bitterness to it. Extremely light and dry cracker like malt addition to just stay the hell out of the way of the hops. Juicy. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. Very light bodied, high hopped, low bitterness libation. Tangerine and mango just rolls off the tongue. Very reminiscient of Pliny and Alpine. 
This is the #1 beer you haven't drank. This is now a must stop spot when in San Diego. If it was anywhere else in the world, it would be the talk of the town, homerism effects etc. . . but since its SD, there's plenty of stuff to divide loyalties and keep these guys under the radar on the national scene. 1,407 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Feb 21, 2013
4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Average fluffy white head with a light orange body. Great looking beer, I bet it looks better fresh from the source.
Smell had an overall tropical aroma mixing mango and tangerine. Underneath were some wild berry and grassy scents.
Taste was smooth for an IPA. A punch of Kiwi hop flavor was there but the bite was quick and clean on the finish. Props to them for packing that much taste with little bitterness. Although Im not totally sure if thats a good or a bad thing. It definitely makes it go down like water.
Malt body was minimally sweet. Decent carbonation for the growler. This beer was awesome and I would definitely like to try more from this brewery. 666 charactersBearsOnAcid, Feb 21, 2013

A - Generous white foam settles to a thin cap, thick collar, and specks of lacing. Transparent golden body.
S - Citrus, lefty with dank herbs, touch of onion, tangerine, some sweet malts and tropical fruits, with a touch of buttered biscuit as well. Light alcohol note that's a surprise but I could be confusing a really sharp pine note for booze.
T - Taste is smoother, with a nice mix of citrus, sweet malts, tropical fruits, leafy herbs, grapefruit zest, and thankfully no booze or onion. There's an almost seltzer-y citrus juice quality to this one.
M - Smooth, dry, medium-full bodied, crisp and clean finish, pleasant carbonation, and minimal alcohol presence. Bitterness is surprisingly low as well.
D - A very nice beer that straddles the line between IPA and IIPA. Eminently drinkable, but didn't wow me quite as much as I expected. A few years ago this would have been a slam-dunk for Top 10 but these days it's merely a very good IPA from an area of the country that has a lot of killer options. 1,092 charactersMasterSki, Feb 18, 2013

4.21/5  rDev -5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A: Clear light amber. Forms a moderate sized fluffy white head. Good retention. Head leaves some minimal lacing on the way down. 
S: Very aromatic. Aroma is full of fruit, but not necessarily the types of fruit you'd expect from an IPA. Mostly grape, but some tropical fruit as well. Maybe a little orange citrus, but its faint. 
T: Very light malt base. Then the flavors I typically associate with Nelson Sauvigon hops. Green grapes and gooseberry. Again, just a hint of tropical fruits and just a very faint hint of lemon along with a little grapefruit pith. A bit sweeter than I was expecting it to be. 
M: On the lighter side of medium. Appropriate carbonation. Mild bitterness. 
O: A nice beer, though a bit sweeter than I was expecting for a San Diego brewed IPA. Otherwise, it brings the otherwise typical light malt body and heavy hops, though the hops used in this brew offer up a lot more than the typical citrus and pine notes. 942 charactersFlorida9, Jan 28, 2013

10oz pour
A: Pours a light hazy straw gold body. Call it blonde. Bubbly with a nice half finger of near white suds and some wisps of cling down the drink. 
S: Smells of white wine grape, gooseberry, pink grapefruit, mango, melons and pine. Light tropical flower with a nice lemony twist. A sugary sweetness to it but no real traceable malt or alcohol in the nose. Fine aroma with a nice influx of Nelson hops. 
T: Tastes leads with white grape and unripe berry. Supporting notes of grapefruit, melon, pine, and a prickly pear like punch. There is an upper moderate amount of perceived bitterness and an awesome charge of herb stems in the finish. Dry malt cracker provides just enough residual sweetness with no real alcohol evident. Super light and refreshingly hoppy. A really great IPA with Nelson’s playing a major part. So juicy!
M: Very light in body with an even upper moderate of carbonation. Lush and prickly. Big drying crisp finish. Oily bitters saturate the palate with some constricting action.
D: Very crushable. Malt is rather tame here with a slightly more assertive hop schedule compared to The Apprentice. Nice use of the Nelson’s without it becoming an Alpine clone. 
My favorite Societe offering thus far. These guys have impressed the most with the fine tuning of their recipes more than anything. A must try. 1,367 charactersNugganooch, Dec 12, 2012

S: nice piney floral hoppy profile with citrus grapefruit present, faint bready malts sweetness, pineapple fruit, hints of mango and slight grass aroma.
T: the hop profile was just as prominent on the palate consisting of earhty, grassy, piney, and floral traits, plenty of tropical fruit flavor, a good bready malty sweetness that balanced out this hoppy bomb, nice citrusy grapefruit that helped on the bitterness and pineapple accents.
M: the brew was medium in body with good amount of carbonation which had a fruity, hoppy, piney, citrusy, bready malty, bitter and oily finish.
O: very good IPA I must say. I didn't think it was going to be that good but was proved wrong. 822 charactersGobzilla, Dec 01, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.564oz growler from the best beer mule in SoCal, my sister! 
Pours a golden/orange color, thin collar, white head, spotty lacing. Aroma is tons of tropical fruit sweetness which includes mango, pineapple, oranges along with some bitter citrus peel notes as well. Flavor is a nice mix of sweetness and hoppy bitterness with mango, pineapple, light pine. Light body, good carbonation, oily sweet finish.
This is a really nice American IPA. I had a pour from the growler immediately after a pour of Hill Farmstead Edward from the kegerator, and while they were both very different, it was hard to pick a favorite from the two. Looking forward to visiting the brewery when I'm out visiting family! 693 charactersSean9689, Oct 01, 2012

Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and pretty refreshing after drinking a bunch of sours. 578 charactersUCLABrewN84, Sep 18, 2012

Looks sort of yellow but then it was nighttime at O'Brien's so I can't be 100% sure. Smelled quite interesting, a real melange of hoppiness, dank, west coast. Flavor sort of diverged from the aroma, very bitter though and as it warmed a bit of lemon goodness. Overall this was a good IPA, hopefully they bottle this in the future. 407 charactersArrogantB, Sep 17, 2012

I can't believe that we aren't gonna see this one again til September. Damn those unattainable Nelson Hops! Oh well, I will still enjoy this while I can. Although The Dandy and The Apprentice are wonderful IPA's, The Pupil has that little extra whack in the face that all of us in SD have grown to love. Thanks guys for making great beer and thanks Mark S. for keeping us in supply.

A: Hazy orange in appearance, slightly opaque, forms a fluffy head that's wispy yet sudsy. 
S: The nose is tropical at the front. Really tropical, like there's a large amount of Nelson hops added. Plenty of honey-sweet malts propelled by ample alcohol volatiles round the bouquet. 
T: Tropical-citrus up front, as expected, mango and guava and lemon. A touch of piny astringency meets a robust malt-backbone, chewy and honey-sweet. The alcohol isn't masked but doesn't overtake, as all of the flavors play supporting roles, leading to a somewhat singular 
flavor profile. The finish is refreshing, almost no aftertaste. 
M: Viscous and oily but light and effervescent on the palate
Living in San Diego, you can become a little jaded and skeptical of craft upstarts. Well, color me convinced - this is one of the best IPA's I've had. I cant stop thinking how much this tastes like Kern's amazing Citra. I'm gonna stop typing now so I can have another. 1,013 charactersrand, Jul 17, 2012

I've had this about 5-8 times now and it never fails to impress. It looks and smells amazing. The beer is brewed with Citra and Nelson hops and tastes like a Rye-less Nelson (from Alpine Beer Co.) A real stand-out beer. Good job Societe.

Appearance: Clear pale gold body topped by two fingers of frothy head.
Smell: Nelson seems dominant here, and that's perfectly fine with me. Notes of gooseberry jam, melon and white grape stand out. It's fairly catty and floral, too. Citra pops out a bit more as the beer opens up, lending it's signature tropical fruit bouquet. There's a slight biscuit-like malt character buried beneath layers of hops. Smells pretty damn excellent.
Palate: The citra/nelson blend is fantastic here, creating one of the more complex hop flavors I've come across. There's gooseberry, guava, grapefruit, white grape and melon, along with some floral undertones and a touch of spiciness. The mouthfeel is excellent - light and dry with no sign of alcohol. Bitterness is low-to-moderate, and malt is negligible beyond contributing body. This feels very Alpine influenced to me, which can only be a good thing. Can't wait to try more beer from this new brewery. 959 characterslargadeer, Jun 28, 2012

Churchill's Pub & Grille
San Marcos, CA
Clear yellow in color with a near-white crown that leaves lined lacing down the glass. The color is lighter than most typical San Diego IPAs. It reminds me of Alpine Nelson's appearance. A great thing to be reminded of. 
Nice balance of citrus, floral, and malty aromas, with some grapefruit character leading the way. There's a bit of juice-like sweetness present as well.
Citrus and floral hops are the most dominant flavors, along with floral and earthy hops, and a moderate level of bitterness. There's some cracker and sweet malt flavor as well and a juice-like characteristic that is quite nice.
Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Crisp. Incredibly drinkable. Obviously well-crafted. Perfect. 
A world-class IPA. I'm excited to try more from this group. 826 charactersehammond1, Jun 18, 2012

On tap at Society. IPA made with Nelson and Citra. That's all I know.
A: Yellow gold with an inch of white froth. Nice color and good clarity. Solid head retention and lots of scattered lacing.
S: Big white grape and gooseberry Nelson profile with mango, guava, orange, and grapefruit. Floral aromatics blend with earth and crackery malt. The hop aroma is outstanding.
T: White grape with mango, nectarine, gooseberry, and lightly spicy grapefruit. The fruit is mouthwatering and juicy. Apparently blending Nelson and Citra makes for an awesome flavor. Smooth moderate bitterness. Malt is crackery and lightly biscuity. The beer is dry with no alcohol flavor. Bitterness waxes in the finish.
M: Lower medium body with upper medium carbonation. Dry and sticky mouthfeel.
Overall: If you like Alpine's Nelson you'll love this. Excellent and highly drinkable. To me this is a step above The Apprentice. I immediately got a growler of this after my first glass.

7/20/12 - I guess I'm updating my score again. The second batch of this beer is even better than the first batch. Apparently they wanted to take the beer in a different direction and go heavier on the Nelson. I'm going to be conservative and just improve the nose, but this second batch blew me away. By far my favorite beer from Societe.
