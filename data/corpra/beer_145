Having this long after I've had the imperial version in Wide Awake, this original version with lower ABV is surprisingly more bacony, with more supporting flavors, as well as a more drinkable feel, yet is obviously thinner. I'm also finding it less sweet, still with that sticky maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, and lightly roasted malt. 
Hmm, I think I prefer this version more actually. 454 charactersSabtos, May 17, 2017

Tastes less maple syrup than smell, more coffee, roast malt. Followed by light chocolate and touches of smoke. Finish is semi sweet with a maple and light smoke linger. Fuller body and creamy medium carbonation. 337 charactersBlackop555, May 15, 2017

Who doesn't like a breakfast beer? First and foremost, this beer lands semi-dry which I really appreciate in a darker flavored brew. While I don't want it to be a bottle of syrup I also don't want it bitter or dry. Maple character comes at me in waves, sometimes I get suggestions of toffee. Roasted character from the malt and coffee are quite pleasant. Hint of smoke an some dark chocolate in the middle. Flavors are perfectly placed and base of this beer, the Porter, stays to style. Lots of fun sipping on this brew. 566 charactersJason, May 09, 2017

Flavor is coffee dominant, with a wonderful maple complement. Slightly woody from the maple as well, and touches of cola, chocolate, and brown sugar.
Smooth and balanced feel, lively.
This is a damn good beer, although I don't get much bacon. I love the coffee forward aspect, and the maple is potent without being overpowering. 450 charactersRoguer, Apr 29, 2017

I honestly was slightly disappointed with the lack of bacon flavor. Would probably have gotten a better review if bacon wasn't so prominently featured in the advertising of this beer. Still, very good especially if you're looking for a maple porter. 528 charactersAntg8989, Apr 17, 2017

The aroma on this beer is straight up, lights out. If someone stuck this in front of my nose while I was sleeping, I'd sit straight up and wonder who was making breakfast. This is so freaking amazing, the amount of fresh maple in this beer is nothing short of amazing. Behind that...chocolate...coffee...and yes, bacon. Five, five, five. 
Flavor is primarily coffee, and licking your lips after you've sopped up your last waffle with the remnants of bacon grease and maple syrup from your breakfast plate. It's got hints of burnt bacon grease where your lady got busy transferring the clothes from the washer to the dryer and let one batch burn a bit. This is painting a picture. How can a beer do that?
Feel is creamy, a bit on the light side, but again this is a porter not a stout, I have to remember that. Nice acidity on the finish from coffee. 
Overall, a work of art in liquid form. It's so impressive, I may save this bottle and keep it as a souvenier. Thanks Aggro2012 for this treat. 1,069 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Apr 07, 2017

It seems to have a medium viscosity. It is a dirty black with a moderate light tan head that settles into a fine ring around the glass soon after pouring. 
The aroma is insane! It just slaps you in the face with genuine maple syrup and smoky, crisp, candied bacon. There is coffee here, but it is the least noticeable aspect. I would go with 60% maple, 30% bacon, and 10% coffee. 
Flavor wise, I get the bacon up front followed by rich, sweet maple syrup amd molasses. There is a creamed coffee taste that is very smooth along side of some lightly charred barley. It finishes again with more lingering maple glazed bacon and a touch of smoke. I am tempted to go a notch higher with the taste score, but I feel like the base beer is just a little weak from a porter standpoint. It is a hair watery and I don't think the malts fight through quite enough. 
The body is about medium, but a lot in part too the hefty amount of syrup I believe. 
The aroma and lingering flavor will haunt me. I am admittedly a huge maple fan, but very few beers deliver a noticeable amount of quality flavor. The bacon probably surprised me the most though. It is very prominent yet restrained enough at the same time. This is a world class flavored beer that is just behind CBS as far as maple beers go. 1,322 charactersWesMantooth, Mar 27, 2017

A: Black in color with a persistent tan head. There fingers retain very well. Lacing is minimal.
S: Sticky maple syrup, Aunt Jemima style, is the top note. Roasty and nutty coffee underneath. Lightly smokey. Toasty and chocolate malt undertones. Wouldn't pick out the bacon readily, but there is perhaps a slight saltiness at play.  It's rather uncanny though, it smells like a pancake breakfast. 
T: Pancakes and syrup, nutty black coffee, cola and thin chocolatey malt. Mild roastiness. Bacon comes out more as a salty/smokey flavor. Quick flashes of dark berries. Syrup and coffee on the finish are again redolent of a pancake breakfast.
M: Medium bodied. Creamy-smooth with some slick and sticky syrup. Ample carbonation scrubs firmly with fine bubbles. 
O: Big flavors coming from a 6% brew, due mostly to the adjuncts and additives. The whole breakfast beer concept was really nailed, and the beer strikes a fine balance too. It's a ballsy idea that was executed to perfection. The nose in particular is one of the most memorable I've come across to date. 1,101 charactersryan1788a5, Mar 26, 2017

A: Pours nearly-black with a tall, thinly bubbled brown head. 
S: Oh wow. Maple aroma is off the chart. A touch of smoke and a bunch of chocolate, covered up mostly by the coffee aroma. But that maple is 90% of it, it is incredible. I scored it just based on the maple alone, it somehow smells BETTER than a bottle of maple syrup.
T: Yup, more of the same. Maple is here in spades but not nearly as sweet as the aroma (thankfully). It definitely has a distinct charred bacon flavor now as well, not just smokiness. Bitter coffee in the middle but it's pretty subtle under all the maple and chocolate. Hell, it's even slightly salty? Unless that's just my mind playing games on me now. Chocolate on the back end and plenty of it. A thick, dark chocolate that reminds me of ganache. Coffee kicks back in a little in the aftertaste, leaving a chocolate/maple/bacon lingering flavor. 
M: Medium bodied, very smooth. 
O: Stellar porter. Flavors are out of this world. Coffee is not dominant like I was expecting (like from many coffee beers), it integrates nicely instead. Very complex, very balanced, super tasty and incredibly smelling. That pretty much sums it all up. 1,206 charactersDope, Mar 26, 2017

Pour: dark. The nose is solid, with sweetness tinged with maple & an overcurrent of coffee. 
Maple Bacon Coffee Porter - has to be in the top 20 of beer names ever. Just copy & paste the name of the beer & you have a review; so considerate of the brewery. The maple is the only component I might be able to pick out, & lends a long, lingering sweet kiss to the brew. Bacon? Maybe a touch of saltine, slight smokiness. Coffee? Maybe a slight bitterness. Light & airy as befits its less-than-RIS ABV. Not interesting enough to drink much of. 
I recall having this at Huna Day in 2014 & thinking “what’s the big deal?” but figured it might well have been palate fatigue, or possibly herpes. Nope. Turns out this stuff just doesn’t do it for me. Pretty good. 885 charactersmaximum12, Mar 23, 2017

Pitch black dark liquid which generates a good bit of foam initially, but eventually becomes just a black liquid with no foam at all.  The smell has plenty of coffee and maple.  It reminds me of pancake with maple syrup breakfast.  Not getting much bacon, when cold or after it warms.  The taste definitely follows the smell: more coffee and maple syrup.  Impressive amount of flavor built into this 6.4% abv porter.  If there is one negative to this beer, it is that it can feel a bit thin... but the lips do get stickier over time.  Overall a very impressive beer. 597 characterseifster82, Mar 22, 2017

Smell is maple syrup, sweetness, roasted malt, coffee, biased toward maple syrup.
Taste is biased to the coffee sadly (I hate coffee) with toasted malt & the maple syrup restrained from the nose. 
Feels smooth over the palate & tongue,  approaching full bodied with a light effervescence. I'd love to try a version without coffee, bet it'd push 5 stars across the board for me. 416 charactersPorterLambic, Mar 14, 2017
4.99/5  rDev +11.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My coworker comes into work and has a few beers in tow. When he said, he had some fresh Funky Buddha beers from Florida that morning. I got giddy like a school girl about to play hopscotch on recess, I was just grinning from ear to ear. A gentle pour produced a two-finger head foamy creamy medium tan color and okay retention. The color beer is dark brown with some ruby highlights. The clarity of the beer is opaque and some carbonation bubbles are visible. 
Holy shit, it smells like pancakes and bacon, seriously pancakes and bacon with a side of coffee. Coffee, milk chocolate, smokiness, pig fat, biscuits, bready, huge maple notes, earthy, woody, and touch of citrus. 
A rich maple flavor, vanilla, wood, earthiness, smokiness, pig fat, bready, pancakes, medium roasted coffee, biscuits, citrus, touch of sweetness. 
A Medium body, medium minus carbonation and a full finish. 
This beer is ridiculous, stupendous, and outrageously tasty. Oh, how I wish I had more, this would be my breakfast in the morning. I was so surprised by this that the word I can only come up with is Stupid Good. I had to text my beer loving brother and said I found breakfast in a bottle. Absolutely a must try for any beer geek. 1,213 characterscolts9016, Mar 13, 2017

Wow, smell is like breakfast with the maple syrup hitting first and foremost like Aunt Jemima's syrup was spilled all over the table. Next up is roasted coffee, molasses, coffee grinds, brown sugar, roasted malt, charred wood, cocoa and a salty meat essence at the end which could be bacon or could be corned beef - no mater how you slice it (pun intended), the meaty finish just adds to the overall excellence of this aroma. So complex and strange, yet wonderful to inhale.
Tastes of bitter black coffee, vanilla, coffee grinds, faint piney hops, roasted grains and charred wood mixed with the sweetness of maple syrup, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, lactose sugar, heavy cream and then an odd salty meat flavor. Late additions of dark chocolate, toasted nuts, cocoa powder and more syrup tie it all up with an insane amount of complexities that kept me guessing and excited for every sip. This is craft beer at it's finest, bold, flavorful and very fun to drink.
Mouthfeel is between thin and average with little to no carbonation, a nice amount of bitterness and a spot on sweetness that could be summed up as this seemed like taking a sip of cold espresso and then a sip of cold black coffee to wash down a mouthful of maple syrup soaked pancakes, salty bacon and lox on toasted pumpernickel break. Funky Buddha porters are funking awesome, this was top notch and well worth seeking out. 1,578 charactersCHickman, Mar 03, 2017

Tastes the same. Maple syrup. No Coffee, definitely no Bacon.
I don't get the hype? If it was just sold as a Maple flavored Stout then its great, But as it is its a one sided beer with none of the expected flavors. 283 charactersKensWorld, Feb 22, 2017

This is just one of those beers you don't understand until you try. Fluffy, almost brown creamy head. Aromas of it's namesake. Oily, sweet pungent taste that coats your mouth with maple and coffee, light smoke and salt. It tastes just like it smells, and it is very fragrant, when you pop a bottle, everyone around you can smell it instantly. It is very balanced, easy to drink, and it's so smooth you would doubt there is alcohol in it at all. The taste lingers in a beautiful way. It's backed by a malty sweetness and slight roast malts that is rarely matched. This is a top 5 beer for me and I'll buy it whenever I see it. 697 charactersNedry, Feb 10, 2017
4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Drank from a 1 pint 6 fl.oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
Served in a snifter
The oily, dark chestnut colored body was topped by a super tight and creamy, inch-tall cap of khaki froth. Decent retention. The head dropped fairly quickly to a thin film. Minimal spotty lacing stuck along the glass.
Maple notes dominated in the nose. This was a total maple bomb. Loads of creamed coffee too. Fair amount of roasted and caramel malts. Vanilla was also apparent. Hint of smoke. I probably would not peg this for bacon however. The smokiness intensified later in the session.
The flavor was more subtle and less maple forward than the aroma. Malty up front. Nice mix of roasted and caramel malts. A touch biscuity. Moderate amount of maple in the center. Some milk chocolate too. Touch of vanilla. Coffee appeared as well. More roast on the back end. The beer finished with a nice mix of roast and sweet, lingering maple notes.
Medium bodied mouthfeel. Creamy and frothy. The liquid contained a fairly aggressive, large bubbled carbonation that initially seemed a bit too intense but settled down with time.
Most flavor-forward dark beers happen to be high ABV stouts and imperial stout. The fact that Maple Bacon Coffee Porter contains such interesting and intense aromas and flavors - yet registers in at a mere 6.4% ABV - is pretty remarkable. When it comes to creative, adjunct-infused beers, nobody does them better than than Funky Buddha. 1,465 charactersDamian, Feb 09, 2017

Smell is breakfast; maple is dominant early, but the coffee plays a more central role as it warms... not much roast/malt to pick up, but I don't think that's what they're going for.
Flavor is on point, all the adjuncts are discernible, but they don't come off as cheap or artificial, its really well balanced. 
Easy to drink and an approachable abv make this pretty sessionable. Can't wait to get more! 440 charactersGreatStoutman, Jan 27, 2017
4.94/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at World of Beer.2017 version.
Thick,creamy,light tan colored head,that stands 1 finger tall.The head gives way to a beautiful lacing on the side of the glass.Jet black in color,with no light showing through the glass.Light carbonation.
On the nose I get a HEAVY dose of maple syrup.This is backed by notes of dark roasted coffee,and smoked bacon.Heavy notes of smoke as well.
On the palate I get smoked bacon up front,followed by dark roasted coffee,and maples syrup.The maple syrup lingers on the tongue well after the sip,along with the smoked bacon.
The body is heavy with a sticky sappy feel.A little thinner than I expected,but still fantastic.
This beer is everything I expected and more.It looks great in the glass and smells and tastes fantastic.The body is a little thinner than I expected,but still has a sticky sappy feel.Funky Buddha does it yet again. 877 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, Jan 26, 2017

My review of MCBP 2017. Dranking it at 50' F.
Looks- Pitch black with very little light getting though. Nice finger and half head.
Smell- Fresh Espresso, Smoke, maple syrup. ( Maple seemed to dominate 2016 version)It reminds me of a Sunday breakfast at the mom and pop diner. Very nice.
 Taste- Fresh Coffee. Smokiness is very present. Maple is lighter compared to last year. But I personally like it. It taste more like a breakfast porter, and less like a dessert beer!!!!
Feel- Smooth and sticky. Well carbonated. 
Overall- I wish I would have tried more version of MBCP. The 2017 is just awesome. Last years was also great, but it was more sweet. I can drink this with out getting tired of it. Awesome Porter. Looking forward to see what they do next year 811 charactersLMO1190, Jan 15, 2017

4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52016 batch. Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Funky Buddha Snifter. Acquired in a trade. 
Pours a deep brown body that's clear on the pour but opaque once in the glass. Small tan head that reduces pretty quickly but leave a ring of foam retention. Little lacing. 
Aromas are thick and rich - tons of maple and coffee, that's about it. Maybe a tad bit of smoke and chocolate, but this is Sunday morning breakfast in a glass otherwise. 
On the tongue initially is lots of freshly roasted coffee, followed by lightly sweet maple, caramel, chocolate, finishes roasty with a touch of smoke. Mouthfeel is a tad thin with medium carbonation. 
FB definitely hit this beer on the nose. If you're looking for a maple coffee beer look no further. A little artificial but enjoyable nonetheless. 785 charactersgcamparone, Nov 22, 2016

Aroma of maple, light smoked notes, some floral coffee notes with some sugary notes makes for an enticing beer. Taste is a great mix of maple, light smoked notes with some sweet Aunt Jamima notes, light coffee with a side order of pancake. Body si about average with good carbonation. Well done and very enjoyable even some notes of artificial flavouring do become apparent over time. 497 charactersPhyl21ca, Oct 14, 2016

Edit : Way better fresh, 2017 bottle about a month old, and just opening the bottle let out an amazing aroma. such perfect balance of roasty coffee, sweet maple and salty robust bacon. Creamy and thick unlike the thinner aged bottle. Def drink fresh. Simply the best! 496 charactersGambyt20, Oct 13, 2016

Dark roasted coffee, with plenty creamy lacto. Taste has that same creamy coffee flavor. Big dark roasted malts, with hints of maple syrup. Subtle salty pop in the back end, wanna say it's reminiscent of bacon. But not too sure. Mouthfeel is thin as expected, pretty low carbonation. Slightly watery. Solid FB offering as usual. Wish I could've tried this fresh, I'm sure a lot of flavors died off. Great novelty beer nonetheless. 650 charactersMateo2699, Oct 04, 2016

Nose is strong maple syrup, a bit of coffee, and some cream.
Taste is a mixture of coffee, smoke, malt, a bit of underlying salt and sweetness.
Mouthful is medium and coating/smooth.  Carbonation is a bit low.  Finish is a touch sweet.
Super duper Porter.  A touch low on carbonation.  Sweet, smokey, hearty, smooth, and very very drinkable.  Seek it out. 424 charactersSlack, Aug 07, 2016

4.13/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to lifeuntappd for the bottle. Split with angrybabboon.
Appearance: Clear dark brown. Forms an initial coffee with cream colored head. Super creamy. Fades to a small clump with a decent collar. Minimal lacing. Head is super creamy with a soft, large bubble structure. Decent retention in the long run. Moderate to light carbonation on the pour.
Smell: Maple candy layered over fresh maple syrup. Slightly salty and meaty tang through the back. Sweet. Salted caramel chocolate. Fresh brewed coffee rolls through the back as well. Everything on the bottle jumps right out. It smells like a diner in full tilt. Deeply roasted with some underlying cocoa. Warming pushes some of the sweetness down and ramps up the bitter coffee edge. Just a ton of maple.
Taste: A bit more roasted and less sweet than the nose would indicate. Maple rides on the back and controls the finish. Deeply roasted. A ton of burnt coffee bean and freshly brewed coffee. The bacon is super hidden. A slight hint of salt creeps through the back and helps amp the sweetness. Salted caramel. Milk chocolate with some alkaline cocoa as well. So much coffee. Malts offer a touch of cooked sweetness. Slightly grassy and earthy as well. A bit of a let down after the smell. The coffee dominates and everything else is shunted to the finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Relatively clean.
Overall: I'll stick to the diner, but this is a nice touch.
This would probably be stellar with a big plate of diner breakfast. Alone it loses a little something and doesn't quite shine. The nose is impressive and sets up an expectation the taste doesn't quite reach. With all of that said, it's good and I'm glad to have tried it. 1,719 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Apr 30, 2016

Big thanks to Goblinmunkey7 for sharing this
A: Dark, deep brown - pours with a medium size, light tan head, fades to a few wisps, leaves some nice lacing
S: Remarkably accurate to the name of this beer - maple and coffee are more prominent than the bacon, which I think was a good choice - rich, lightly sweet maple - the maple sweetness is rounded out by the lightly salty, meat - roasty coffee, a nice dark roast - some malty sweetness, with hints of molasses and toffee - some creaminess, but I'm not clear if lactose was involved - overall, potent but well-balanced
T: Breakfast - roasty coffee and coffee beans - coffee with cream - nice amount of maple, where it doesn't dominate, but it makes its presence known - bacon is on the light side, but it's definitely there, with some light saltiness and meatiness - on the sweet side overall, with caramel, molasses, and toffee - some chocolate malts as well - lingering sweetness in the finish
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, a touch oily with some residual sugars in the finish
O: Worth getting out of bed
I usually don't eat breakfast. But I could drink this every morning. Unfortunately, I have a job, so I guess that dream is out of my reach. 1,228 charactersangrybabboon, Apr 30, 2016

S-Aroma is insanely great, straight breakfast, just need the pancakes to go with it. 
T-Taste is again maple and bacon with some coffee and vanilla. 
M-Mouthfeel is well balance, maybe a touch thin but it's a porter with a lot of stuff added to it.

L - dark brown with a nice thin white head.  Thin but solid for a porter
S - Coffee and maple burst out of the glass.  Minimal smoke/bacon until it really warmed.  A hint of milk chocolate
T - maple syrup, coffee, bacon, milk chocolate perfectly balanced after a bit of warming.  Really really enjoyable.  So unique that it's difficult to describe, but the beer name is very accurately described
F - thin, but super drinkable.  Very smooth
O - This would beat the hell out of any other breakfast drink.  The bacon/smoke addition is awesome when combined with the maple syrup.  I really enjoyable unique type of beer that is exceptionally well done. 685 charactersrabbott2, Apr 12, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%look: 3 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25A: First thought after the pour was that this looks like a glass of cola. Very little head to speak of, with a cola colored body that lightens further around the edges of the glass. Tiny carbonation bubbles continually rise to the top of the glass. This is a very average looking beer. 3.0 for appearance.
S: It might not look great, but it smells fantastic! One of the more fun smelling things I've had the pleasure to drink. I don't get very much coffee on the nose, but there is a distinct smell of maple sausage that takes me straight to Saturday morning breakfast. If the coffee were more distinctly there, I would give a 5 for aroma. As is, 4.75 will have to do.
T: I can clearly pick out the maple and a lingering saltiness that I would imagine is playing the role of "bacon". Coffee is there a little bit, but seems to be playing more of a complementary role than anything else, perhaps to balance the maple sweetness. Very tasty beer - 4.25.
M: Fairly thin, which isn't surprising given the style and ABV. That being said, the mouthfeel is holding this beer back from its true potential. Perhaps the BA or imperial versions have more of the body I'm looking for. Definitely an easy drinker, and combined with the lower ABV this would be an easy beer to drink in quantity around a campfire with friends. 3.75 for mouthfeel.
O: Very good, but didn't quite live up to my (admittedly lofty) expectations. The aromas and flavors are excellent, but the look and feel don't quite measure up. I would certainly drink this again, but I doubt that I'll be going through the effort of getting another bottle. 4.25 out of 5. 1,625 charactersKevinL, Mar 30, 2016

 Really good stuff. As a porter its a bit thinner but that makes it an easy sipper and at the lower ABV this can be a "summer night around the firepit" type brew also. Base is solid with a bit of saltiness from the bacon(?), but then tons of maple on the nose. The coffee is there but just to balance the sweetness. Great porter. 350 charactersSHerninko, Mar 29, 2016

4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured at 49°F from a 22oz bottle (2016) into a snifter. Consumed on 09Mar16.
LOOK: Pours with a fingers worth of cinnamon colored foam. At 20 seconds, the head changes color to khaki. At 50 seconds, the head has halved itself. Black in color with an orange tint. Rising bubbles are both small and medium in size and high in quantity. Lacing is thin and moderate.
SMELL: Strong aromas of sweet coffee and maple syrup entangle with mild sweet chocolate and hickory smoked bacon aromas. Subtle salt, vanilla, and bitter roasted malt aromas are also present. 
TASTE: Very strong flavors of sweet coffee first strike the palate and are immediately followed by mild maple syrup and sweet chocolate flavors. Mild hickory smoked bacon and bitter roasted malt flavors further unravel the taste complexity. Subtle salt and vanilla flavors enter last as all previous flavors continue pushing on. 
FEEL: Somehwere between medium-bodied and light-bodied. Carbonation is subtle. Goes down smooth, but is too thin to be creamy. Finishes with a mild and pleasant dryness.
NOTE: This was better than I thought it was going to be. I thought the smokey bacon flavors were going to be too much, but they were well balanced and allowed the syrup and coffee to dominate. Yet another spectacular brew from Funky Buddha. These guys do not disappoint. 1,328 charactersMyotus, Mar 10, 2016

The taste is mostly bitter coffee and a touch of artificial maple syrup on the end. No discernible bacon anywhere. 
The feel is thin. 
Overall, a pretty average beer. There are plenty of shelf beers that beat this one out. 
This used to be the beer that Florida traders relied upon to gain favorable trades outside of their market. For my taste buds, this beer is not one worth revisiting or acquiring in a trade. 460 charactersrodmanfor3, Mar 01, 2016

I honestly didn't know what to expect with the bacon, but I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor.  It was definitely there but not obnoxiously so.

4.87/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Opened and shared this with a couple of friends for game night. The moment you pull the cap off the bottle you know you're in for something interesting. That maple nose oozes out of the bottle reminiscent of a Looney Toons cartoon pie lifting characters off the ground through the physical forces of amazing aromas. Syrup covered pancakes all the way.
We pretty much all agreed that the midlevel ABV worked better than something in the imperial range. A huge ABV would have been distracting, and added unnecessary sweetness to a beer that's already well balanced. Interestingly, the coffee didn't seem all that strong in the taste. It was there, but certainly took a backseat to the maple. Similarly, the bacon wasn't at all overpowering either as you often find in "bacon" flavored brews. Overall, an outstanding balance from the tip of the tongue all the way to the backbone. 878 charactersAngerhaus, Feb 27, 2016

As soon as the top is popped the smell is evident from across the room. Straight maple goodness all over the place. Pours a deep black, thin lacing, small tan head. Again the smell is all maple with a faint bit of smokiness. Beautiful.
Mouthfeel is slick but thin, does not coat heavily and the perfect carb cleans evenly but not in a harsh way. 
Taste is all maple initially. As we warm up to 45-50 chocolate and coffee enter the picture and provide some balance to the sweetness. Again just an awesome experience. Sweet maple, coffee, smokiness all in harmony. 
If I were offered this normally I'd have low expectations but FB crushed it here.
Perhaps the perfect breakfast beer for a game day tailgating at breakfast time! 743 charactersMS22, Feb 24, 2016

The smell was amazing, full of maple syrup, coffee, and smoked bacon! The taste is like a full breakfast as the maple comes through first as it mixes with the coffee before finishing off with bacon. The feel was a little above medium as it had some thickness and creaminess to it and low carbonation. I never thought this beer would live up to the hype but it did. Definitely one of the best porters I've ever had! 479 charactersMeyers1023, Feb 18, 2016

4.68/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer pours a very dark brown with a one finger dark khaki head that dissipates quickly to a small ring around the edge of the glass. There are very few spots of lacing. The smell is seemed subtle at first pour, but as it warmed it became very strong and very complex. Sweet maple syrup, roasted malts, sweet chocolate, coffee, and a slight smokiness all intertwine wonderfully. Taste is similar, but even better. It does not start off nearly as subtle as the smell, but it also enhances greatly as the beer warms. All the flavors from the smell come through, but they are turned up all the way. The smokiness really comes through nicely on the finish and lingers on the pallete which mixes extremely well with the wonderful sweet maple flavor. Feel is medium and slick, but creamy at the same time. Overall this is an absolutely amazing beer. Each of the flavors come through so wonderfully and very rich, and yet it stays true to style by not being too heavy and stout like. Easily the best porter I have ever had. 1,020 charactersCNoj012, Feb 13, 2016

Taste is pure smooth delicious creamy porter with maple to boot.  Sweetness, but not overwhelming.  Breakfast in a glass is entirely accurate.  You could almost pour this beer on your pancakes.  Coffee, chocolate and syrup -- not overly done so that it's overwhelming... nicely balanced.  This is a fantastic beer that defines 'breakfast' style. 425 charactersanteatr23, Feb 07, 2016

Pours a beautiful pitch black with very slight tan head.
Aroma-  amazing.  I could literally just smell this beer for hours.   I get the whole breakfast experience with this.  Bacon, coffee and maple.  Perfection
Taste-  not quite as good as smell,  but damn good.  Bacon first, with coffee and maple coming in late.   Not a maple bomb at all,  much more subtle.
Mouthfeel  is medium bodied.   Perfect for the ABV.
Overall-  Prob the best porter I have ever had.   Really looking to drinking its big brother Morning Wood this coming weekend. 592 charactersjcflorian, Feb 03, 2016

S: Gorgeous sticky and sweet maple syrup on the nose with a secondary hint of dark roasted coffee 
T: Upfront maple flavors transition into bitter coffee and smoky, savory saltiness
F: A bit thinner than I would have hoped for, but still a very smooth mouthfeel with slight carbonation
O: Simply an outstanding porter and ranked highly on BA for good reason. The bottle describes this beer as a 'diner-style breakfast in a glass' and my experience evoked a similar experience. Given my sweet tooth, I actually wish they had emphasized the sugary maple notes a bit more and enhanced the creaminess and depth of the mouthfeel. These alterations would have made this perfect for me, but as it stands as a diner-style breakfast, this beer very much hits all the right notes with decided aplomb. Well done. 913 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 02, 2016

Smell just explodes from the glass, bit off coffee but mostly just amazing maple aromas.  really could have mistaken it for a plate of pancakes with bacon.
On the palate maple dominates with bacon smokiness.

Tons of maple in the aroma, as expected. Didnt get much else. Taste has alot of maple and some smokiness (bacon) but the flavors fade so fast, you can't enjoy them. Finish is porter roastiness and mouthfeel is very thin. 
I was somewhat disappointed in this and feel that it's overhyped. 384 charactersRAlmeida77, Jan 26, 2016

Really complex and addictive. Taste follows coffee sweet maple smokey bacon. Perfect balance. Medium carb and mouth feel. As it settles on my palette its like I ate pancakes and washed it down with Starbucks. As it warms the smokey bacon shines with a dry bitter finish. Each sip is a little different. Doesn't lose any character. Amazing how the flavors separate themselves, rotate and compliment each other. I can  definitely see why others mention dark chocolate, vanilla and coconut as well. Fantastic. This beer is a unique craft beer experience you want to share with friends. 696 charactersToastedB, Jan 18, 2016

A- pours a deep brown, almost black color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that reduce to a ring, leaving nothing behind 
S- breakfast in a glass. Initially pure maple syrup aroma gives way to freshly brewed coffee, followed by chocolate chip pancakes, smoky charred malt gives smoky aromas, reminiscent of smoked pork, more creamy dark chocolate aroma mixed perfectly with the sweetness of the maple. This literally smells like a plate of hot cakes with bacon and coffee 
T- initially fresh coffee hits the palate with some herbal and earthy notes, the maple plays more of an immediate sweetness to compliment the coffee. Mid-palate brings rich dark chocolate, along with some creamy vanilla & caramel.  As it nears the finish, strong notes of smoked malt bring flavors of charred wood, smoke and smoky bacon. The linger provides a long stay of smoke and coffee 
M- medium body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and a slightly creamy finish 
O- one of the most unique beers I've ever had, with distinct flavor profiles throughout the sip. An outstanding beer that I can't stop smelling 1,160 charactersTreyliff, Jan 07, 2016

4.95/5  rDev +11%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5WOW. This might just be my favorite porter of all time. As expected the mouthfeel was a bit thin as most porters are, but everything else was on point. Tons of smoke on the nose and taste from the bacon and lots of nice sweetness from the maple syrup. So well balanced and tasty. 279 charactersBeerSamurai34, Oct 28, 2015
4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The body on this supposedly fine beer has a deep brown body that looks semi-viscous as it flows from this fine looking bottle.  I especially enjoy that it has a Buddha shadow on it, since I practice the art of Zen.  The head is fine and foamy.  When the beer exited the bottle, the head was super reactive, foaming to a nice one inch head, that quickly dissipated into a thin mocha film that gathered around the edges.  Nice melt off the sides of the glass as I consume this porter.
Noice!  The smell is exclusive and unique.  The first distinguishable smell is of maple syrup.  Very distinct.  Behind that is smoke and roast.  No bacon for me.  I'm almost vegetarian anyways, so it does not bother me.  The maple syrup smell clearly dominates.  If the smoke and roast are in the back seat, the coffee is in the trunk.  A top notch, charming aroma.  
Noice!  This is definitely different.  Maple syrup, tacky porter, smoke and roast, medium malts, and I can imagine in my head a piece of vegetable matter bacon, along with a small spot of coffee.  With all of that going on in my chomper, this finishes quite nicely and clean.  No after tastes.  Not dry, but everything fades away cleanly.  I was expecting a sugary and tacky aftertaste, but nothing is left behind.  Clean.
Great bubble up throughout the drink and swallow, that is not only full and dense, but also delicate.
Overall, I would say that this is a superb porter that has earned a spot on my periodic beer menu. 1,478 charactersmabermud, Oct 27, 2015

L: Black with a tan head that dissipates quickly. Nice carbonation and some lacing. 
S: First thing I smell is maple. Coffee is present, but it seems to have faded significantly over time. Some smokey notes in the background. 
T: Starts off with a faded coffee/chocolatey taste up front, then it opens up to maple sweetness, some more coffee/chocolate notes and then finishes with a subtle smokiness.
M/D: Medium body with light to medium carbonation. Very nice. Some people say it's too thin, and I can see that, but I think the body is totally fine. 
O: An exceptional porter that has a lot going on the nose and the palette. It's got quite a bit of sweetness to it that, while not cloying, I'd still recommend sharing it with a friend. Cheers! 826 charactersrockernino, Sep 12, 2015

3.98/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4I enjoyed this at a share and my rating reflects the opinions of most that were there. But I want to say I was very fortunate to try it.
It certainly very dark, but thin and a poorly developed head (very coarse and sparse). The nose was mostly smoky and coffee. I did not get bacon nor maple. The taste was mostly smoke (very subtle which was good), and coffee. A little hop bite. No bacon or maple in the taste, The body was very lacking: very thin, light, and a little watery.
Now this was a good beer. Did it fit the description, no. I feel it is overrated and not worth the hassle of obtaining one. I felt this was a moderately well crafted porter with strong espresso and smoke - not over the top - but still strong. 723 charactersmacher0, Aug 23, 2015

Definitely interesting in that it definitely is a maple-y, bacon-y, coffee porter - just a little too flawed. 196 charactersthegerm87, Jul 04, 2015

Sweet maple syrup and coffee.
Harsh, grainy coffee and some smoke leaves no room for anything chocolate from malt. Not getting bacon or maple, disappointing in that regard. No where near as good as the smell.
Medium carbonation is a little much. 269 characterspants678, Jul 03, 2015

Pours a black color, turning dark red at the edge of the glass, with a decent beige, bubbly head.
Has an intriguing nose, featuring toffee, bready malts, cold pressed coffee, raisins, old, slightly skunky wood, and a whiff of syrup, together with salt. Smells complex in comparison to its lighter body, tied together by bakers chocolate. Not what I would expect from a porter, but quite unique and very pleasant.
Has a fitting medium carbonation among a lighter body, leaving a lot of room on the palate for bready coffee.
As well as the nose comes together, regarding its complexity, the taste is rather one-dimensional and thin. It exhibits raisins, toasty malts and an extreme overload of cold pressed coffee, rolling over all the other possible flavors, hindering the beer from developing more subtle notes, as featured in the aromas. The coffee though isn't very pleasant on the tongue, it includes no cream, but cold ash and a metallic, distracting flaw. Developes an unpleasant mix of metal, cold coffee and sticky sweet malts in the finish, leaving back a nice flavour of roasty hazelnuts at the very back end of the palate. 
Tastes more like a stout than an actual porter, due to its incredibly dominant coffee presence, opening the tongue to roast and earth, as well as old tobacco and cold ash unfortunately. Its sudden turn into a sweeter direction during the finish seems a little off, as it gets unpleasantly introduced by a bubbly, metallic carbonation, rather than more fitting cream or chocolate - basically plays both ends against the middle. Evokes an overall colder appearance, leading back to the coffee, while especially the maple syrup should be able to lend a certain warming quality to the beer - it does not, feels more like a gimmick than an actual necessary ingedient, forming the appearance of the taste. 1,850 charactersaleigator, Jun 20, 2015

4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bomber, Poured into snifter.
Look: Thin tan head, deep black coffee colour. 
Smell: Dominate Maple aroma with caramel toffee notes. Dark coffee aroma. Reminds me of coffee in a diner. Hint of bacon. 
Taste: Maple, dark malts, vanilla, bacon on the back end. Taste lingers through out from the beginning to the finish. Everything is balanced yet you get each individual taste.
Feel: Silky smooth, velvety mouth fell that coats your tongue and gives plenty of time for the individual flavors to rise.
Overall: Best flavored porter to date. The long finish is amazing. They linger for minutes after each sip. Like breakfast in a bottle. Recommend drinking as fresh as possible. 
Note: Wide Awake It's Morning, the imperial version, is even richer and fuller. 767 charactersFly_Moe, May 21, 2015

From a bomber into a snifter
Porter with coffee, maple syrup and natural flavors added
APPEARANCE: Clear dark brown pour yields a 2+ finger, medium looking, creamy, light tan head with very good retention. Clear black body with medium levels of carbonation evident. Slowly fades to a full foamy cap. 
SMELL: A bold maple aroma jumps right out of the bottle upon opening. Pretty impressive. Lots of maple syrup, cotton candy, caramel and piles of butterscotch, some coffee, a touch of roasted aromas as well, but really, this is a maple syrup and butterscotch bomb. Impressive stuff, though perhaps a little over done, believe it or not. Maple syrup is notoriously difficult to get to come through, and here it comes through in droves. 
TASTE: Perhaps not as impressive as the nose had indicated, unfortunately. Some caramel and toffee sweetness up front, with a touch of coffee flavor as well, but it all comes across a bit bland and muted compared to the onslaught of aroma. A medium but lingering finish of sweet maple syrup, butterscotch, some notes of bitter, creamy coffee and some lightly roasted flavors as well. It’s interesting and satisfying enough, but there’s not much in terms of the smoke you’d expect from the description, and unfortunately it’s not nearly as decadent or as satisfying as the nose. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. A little foamy and perhaps a touch watery on the palate, not creamy enough really, goes down fine and finishes rather dry. 
OVERALL: This is the second time I’ve had this beer and I hate to say that it’s the second time it didn’t quite live up to expectations, unfortunately. It is an enjoyable drink, but the flavor doesn’t follow the brilliance of the nose and the feel is a little weak, which doesn’t help the situation either. For me, the flavor would have to be a little more forthcoming and the feel smoothened out before I could really join in all the praise that this beer gets. For now, it’s just not quite as spectacular to me. In any case, I was really happy to see this one again, so cheers to 7clutch for sending one over. 2,320 charactersJeffo, Apr 29, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Super amazing awesome beer!  Most of these reviewers must have gotten a different batch than I got.   The aroma is amazing.   I didn't wash out the bottle just so I could smell it for days.  Maple upfront, lots of coffee in the middle, then light bacon smoke to top it off.   Best Porter there is (at least that I have found).  I have traded for two more since this first bottle.   By the way,  I drank the first within weeks of the annual release party. 454 charactersTravitten, Apr 20, 2015

4.95/5  rDev +11%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5A: Pitch black pour with a thin khaki colored head. The head quickly dissipates into a ring around my glass.
S: Smells of black coffee and strong maple syrup. A hint of smokiness is also picked up. Reminds me of breakfast, which is obviously the intention. I've had coffee beers and maple beers, but the medley of the two in the nose is divine.
T: Black coffee is first, followed by bacon covered with maple syrup. The saltiness from the bacon flavor works very well with the sweetness of the syrup. This is definitely one of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Sometimes with beers you're searching for the flavors within the beer, but with MBCP the flavors are very pronounced and straight forward. No guess work here.
F: A fairly heavy mouthfeel for a porter, but thinner bodied than a stout would be. The maple flavor lingers on my pallet until I take another sip. 
Overall: This is one of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had. The flavors are unique for a beer in the sense that it tastes like I poured maple syrup in a cup of coffee and dipped my bacon in it. I wish these were more readily available, especially in my neck of the woods. I'm definitely going to savor every sip of this. 1,200 charactersRichD, Mar 09, 2015

Appearance: Very dark brown, looked like a thicker porter, but a porter nonetheless.
Aroma: Its all there, oddly enough the aroma was more dominant right out of the bottle and faded once poured into a glass. Coffee was definitely more dominant, but the maple and bacon were definitely in there. Smelled like breakfast in a bottle!
Taste: Not too sweet, very well balanced. The coffee was the most prominent note, but on the back end there was a subtle note of maple and then the bacon came through even more mildly, but there nonetheless. 
Overall: Very well made porter, interesting concept, I just wish it wasn't so hard to get! Lucky I have a fantastic trading partner from Florida who hooked me up! 797 charactershumuloner22, Mar 06, 2015

4.49/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a dark, totally opaque black and without head formation/retention. The nose is initially spicy coffee-forward, but the maple sweetness comes through much stronger as the beer warms. The taste carries forward distinct maple sweetness, bacon smokiness, and coffee bitterness, while maintaining the integrity of a solid porter base - a very unique and enjoyable experience. Despite the heavy handed flavor profile and nearly-still body, I'm impressed by this beer's drinkability. The mouthfeel is rich with flavor, but isn't quite as heavy as a stout and despite the adjuncts, there is still some roasted malt in the finish that reminds me this is a porter. Pleased to have tried this and would definitely recommend it to others 740 charactersThePorterSorter, Feb 28, 2015

The aroma is where FB excels. It is literally breakfast in a glass. Maple sweetness, bacon smokiness, a strong roasted coffee, all covered in a touch of milk chocolate.
The flavor follows with the coffee up front, a bit of chocolate, very little smoked bacon flavor, and a medium plus porter quality.
An imperial version of this would be out of this world. 392 charactersdar482, Feb 24, 2015

Pours an oily and fairly dark black, with a quarter inch head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells intoxicating. You get every aspect of the name- I get maple up front, with bitter, roasted coffee beans, and some meaty smoke in the background.
I gotta hand it to Funky Buddha, they nailed this one. When you call something Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, you expect everything to be there, and it really is. The maple and coffee are the strong flavors for me- I get rich, syrupy maple and molasses up front, with a very earthy, slightly burnt coffee flavor, and some earthy smoke that really does resemble bacon. It's like a perfect breakfast. I get almost a cigarette flavor from this too, from the smoke. Other than the advertised flavors, I get some chocolate and roasted malt.
This is medium bodied, pretty thick and full flavored for the lower ABV. It's pretty creamy and goes down real easy.
This is amazing. A brilliant brewing achievement from Funky Buddha. 999 charactersGreesyFizeek, Feb 14, 2015

May have to go against the tide on this one and say this isn't exactly a world-class beer, but a very good one nonetheless for a gimmicky porter style. 442 charactersCuriousMonk, Feb 08, 2015

A- Dark black body, looks like black coffee. Two finger mocha head with average longevity, fades into a medium sized brown collar. No lacing to be found.
S- Smells like breakfast. Strong coffee aromas, and good quality coffee at that, too. Maple syrup sweetness is very hard to miss here, it smells like pancakes. Don't get a whole lot of bacon aromas although it does seem a bit smoky to me. Plenty of chocolate and nutty, toasted malt. Awesome.
F- Tastes like breakfast, too. Sticky maple syrup sweetness perfectly complements the moderately acidic black coffee flavours and bitterness. A moderate amount of smoke contributes some bitter complexity. Nutty base beer, not too much roast to be found. Smoky and bitter coffee on the backend, with a dollop of maple syrup. Delicious.
M- Medium bodied, a bit lower in carbonation than I'd expect from the style but plenty enough to make it a wonderful drinking experience. Sticky sweet maple syrup coats the mouth while the bitter coffee and smoke linger on the palate for a long time afterwards. No joke. This is very drinkable and tasty.
O- Hype is well-deserved, excellent breakfast porter that absolutely smells and tastes like breakfast. It's different than Mornin' Delight in that the body is quite a bit lighter in this beer and the coffee tends to contribute more of a bitterness than actual flavour here, but the maple syrup is proportionally strong in this beer. The best comparison I can make is that this is a baby Good Morning, which is a compliment to both beers. Its hard to think of a brewery that does flavoured porters (and adjunct beers in general) better than Funky Buddha. Cheers! 1,696 charactersStevedore, Feb 06, 2015

*** TICK #500 -  featured SuperBowl beer, Seattle/New England, Feb 2015  ***
(Drank this with some chips and seven-layer-dip over at my wife's father's house in Pleasant Hill, CA. It was only after I'd finished the beer that I found out there were pulled pork sandwiches coming at halftime, which was extremely frustrating, as they obviously would have been a perfect pairing...)
Being a porter guy, this one's a no-brainer; there was no way I wasn't going to love it, and love it, I did.
Maple gives it a nice thickness and nice sweet overtones. Smoke is subtle. Calling it "Bacon" is maybe overstating it a little. When blended in with the sweet and smoky, the coffee also drinks subtle, less pronounced than in other beers.
The lighter body is nice, coming in at a very manageable 6% or so. It still carries its flavors quite effectively.
Outstanding, obviously. Reminds me a bit of Cellarmaker's Coffee & Cigarettes, in its overall feel. One I'd definitely trade for again. 1,103 charactersronricorossi, Feb 02, 2015

Edit: 3/27/2015 - Shared a bottle with friends - A few months later and this beer is still as good as fresh. Tons of Maple on the nose as soon as the bottle was opened. Still very smooth and silky with plenty of coffee, maple and meaty roast. 393 charactersMangbus, Jan 21, 2015

Pours pretty much black with a creamy one finger khaki brown head. Beautiful aroma of smoke, chocolate, big maple syrup, coffee. Whoah. Flavor is big time maple syrup,big smokey bacon, coffee, light cocoa notes, roasty malts. Yep. It's all there. Medium bodied, creamy but not imperial stout heavy. Very easy drinking and really nice dessert. This lives up to the hype. Stoked to try the imperial version at Huna day. 470 charactersBMMillsy, Jan 17, 2015

4.58/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5I've had this beer many times living so close to the original FB Lounge.  As stated in an earlier review, sometimes this beer can be a little off but when it's on it's amazing!  The MBCP served at the release party at the brewery on 1/10/15 was the best I've had.  The coffee, maple and hint of smoke blended perfectly with just the right amount of hop bite for balance.  I went back to the brewery the next night and it was as good as I remembered. Since then there have been releases at the brewery where the bitterness has been raised and the sweetness has been lowered (intentionally?). It's good with a little hop bite but when it gets too hoppy it throws the beer off. Lowering the sweetness actually helps to bring out the coffee flavor but when there is almost no sweetness (8/20/16 batch at brewery) it's actually not even good. 837 charactersELS, Jan 13, 2015

Pours a nice dark beer. Forms a little bit of foam, which does not retain. Smell is of coffee, with a very distinct maple scent. Taste reveals a syrupy coffee that tastes like maple and closes with the smokiness of the bacon. It is a tad sweet, not heady at all.
Over time, some of the great characters of this beer disappear. Much better fresh. 390 charactersJulioH, Jun 20, 2014

In terms of smell this beer carries the Maple and coffee extremely well. Pancake-y sweet and luscious with a healthy dollop of rich sweetened coffee. Bacon on the nose is non existent. Had it been alive, this beer would be worthy of a cologne like enterprise.
That said, MBCP simply can't follow through on the promise of the nose. While good....nice maple and coffee presence here as well...it's neither all that deep nor does it carry any of the promised bacon. What's here is good, but if it could carry the olfactory flirtations it could be special.
A nice porter with some good components, but not quite up to Last Snow standards. 695 charactersBarrytheBear, Apr 25, 2014

A - Pours a dark brown with a large foamy dark tan head that fades very slowly.
S - Smoke hits first, then some maple, then over powered by the coffee.
T - Smokey bacon, then some smooth coffee, finishs with some sweet maple.
D - Heavy to medium body with good carbonation.
O - I'm impressed. How'd they get all those flavors in there. Very layered and tasty. 409 charactersHuskyinPDX, Apr 22, 2014

A- Pitch black pour from the bomber to several glasses for our tasting. A one finger tan cap builds up and retains fairly well. The head falls to a creamy, foamy ring with some islands in the middle. Lacing starts out with spots and dies out after some time.
S- Holy maple syrup from the heavens, dominant syrup reigns supreme here as I open the bottle. Some smokiness and caramel as well as cocoa roast grains in the backdrop of the maple pancakes.
T- Liquid breakfast feel that reminds me of a pancake drenched in good maple syrup. Coffee opens up here immensely compared to the nose and adds to the breakfast experience, nice medium roast beans. Roast cereal grains, cocoa powder, some fruits, more maple syrup and some smoke.
MF- Medium bodied with a nice creamy texture and some frothiness. Carbonation at a moderate level and works out fine with the rich breakfast assault. Light coffee bitterness.
Lots to say but it just all works out into an experience of liquid breakfast, and a good one at that. I swear I'm getting ghost sausage grease notes because I feel like I'm at a breakfast joint. Lives up to its name. 1,256 characterscbutova, Apr 08, 2014

Appearance - Dark brown, some clarity and flecks noticeable. Bubbly beige head retains great as a full cap, no lace left.
Smell - Wha! Straight up chocolate chip pancakes drenched with maple syrup and butter, with just hints of smoke, roast and coffee. Not getting the bacon but absurdly unreal, authentic and rich. 
Taste - Not as insane, but more balanced and quite good in its own right. Lingering flavors of maple, cocoa, coffee, light roast and caramel. Definitely not getting bacon which is unfortunate, but hard to complain really. 
Mouthfeel - A little on the thin side with low carbonation, fits the beer decently but I thought this category could've used more oomph. Sweetness/richness is a bit cloying but it's tasty enough for it not to be an issue.
Overall - Really crazy stuff, this is savory maple breakfast madness. Rich enough so a small pour would probably suffice, but so tasty I can't help but quaff. Kinda simple and sweet but I think it'd be hard not to dig this one. Next time I have this, I'd like it with a side of French Toast Double Brown, please. 1,209 charactersChico1985, Apr 06, 2014

A- Dark brownish hue around the edge with pitch black in the center. Large lacing with no legs. 
S- The best quality of this brew. Huge huge maple syrup, then maple syrup, then maple syrup, then cofee chocolate and a well done bacon slight slight background. 
T- Most maple syrup I have ever had. I am late on the maple game, but I will have CBS this weekend. Hope I get something out of that one at this point. Bacon is not offputing, has a well done bacon taste, coffee is present along with chocolate. 
M- Very nice smooth with the right amount of carb. 
O- A great candy beer that I am in first glass of. Thank God I have other styles to mix in tonight to help me crush this brew. 707 charactersgueuzedreg, Apr 04, 2014

Huge thanks to Aespi for sending me this when i haven't even shipped to him yet.
Poured from a 22oz. bottle, no #freshbeer info (but i know it is!).
Pours a dark brown, which a thick tan head and great retention. The aroma is simply stunning! They totally nailed it. Fresh cooked breakfast, bacon fat, smoke, fresh brewed coffee, maple soaked pancakes and a bit of milk chocolate. Flavor is less intense but still good. Strong on the bacon, good robust coffee and ends in a sweet maple note. Very low carbonation. Even texture has that greasy feel mixed with warm sweet coffee and the feel of sticky syrup. This is breakfast in a glass and i loved it. 673 characterspapat444, Mar 31, 2014

A: Pours a dull black with a finger of light brown head, which a few streaks of lacing on the glass as it recedes to a solid cap. Superb retention.
S: Wow, loads of sweet maple syrup and coffee, smoked roasty malts that don’t really scream “bacon” to me, and some fresh mint. They have the maple and coffee spot-on, though. 
T: Medium roast coffee up front, along with the malts, with the syrup more noticeable mid-palate, some fresh mint, followed by an everlasting finish of coffee and syrup. Not quite as amazing at the nose, but still super tasty. It’s got just a little sweetness from the syrup, but (fortunately!) it’s pretty subtle; not what you might expect.
M: Medium-light body, smooth, with medium carbonation. 
O: Highly drinkable and a great novelty. I can only imagine the food pairings for this, assuming I had extra bottles to piss away. The aroma is amazing, though the taste doesn’t *quite* live up to it. And I’m not getting any bacon from this. Maybe it’s already faded? 1,036 characterspmarlowe, Mar 30, 2014

S-Lots of maple syrup. Coffee and chocolate. A salty, cured meat aroma as well. The name doesn't miss the mark.
T-Flavor is surprisingly more tame than I was expecting. Maple was there, so was a good bacon approximation. The coffee was clearly there as well. However, it wasn't as eye opening as it should have been.
M-Medium bodied. Softer carbonation. 
O/D-A little bit disappointing but still pretty tasty. I am clearly in the minority because people go bonkers for this beer. 529 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 23, 2014

A: Pours a very dark brown, practically black, with near 2 fingers of khaki colored head that reduces fairly slowly and leaves a hefty collar. 
S: Maple syrup coming through like crazy! Not sure if it's necessarily bacon also there, but definitely a nice smokey compliment that reminds me of hickory smoked bacon. Coffee is definitely there, and adds a layer I've never experienced in an aroma. 
T: Sweet maple syrup and coffee up front. A perfect blend of maple and smoke in the after taste that lingers for minutes after each sip. 
M: Very smooth, leaving a slightly dry feel. 
O: I understand why there is a lot of hype behind this one. Crazy delicious, from aroma up front to the lingering aftertaste that just works so well. I've had a handful of different offerings from Funky Buddha, and they do everything right. 850 charactersroger617, Mar 14, 2014

Growler to small snifter
Thanks to @floweryair
App- Out the growler pours a generous brown color with a smaller tan head that dissapated rather quickly. A smaller lack of cling down the sides as well. A little bit less of rentention of color than I was thinking, but for a porter had nice tones and highlights as well.
Smell- So I dont normally do this, I tend to go more in depth. Maple. Check. Bacon. Check. Coffee. Check. Yep all there. Done!
Taste- To me it was a bit light but all the flavors were there which I could appreciate. The dominant flavor was more of the maple and malt vs. smoke which I greatly appreciated as I tend to shy away from smoke beers. The coffee added a nice dimension to a style known for being a bit light.
Mouth- An acceptable medium body with a pretty good residual flavor profile. A bit of the maple and a little chocolate remained for me. I liked the body the best about this. Smooth, clean and balanced.
Drink- A highly anticipated beer for me and I am glad I was finally able to tick this one. I wonder how the bottle holds up vs. growler, but I wont trade for one. 1,128 charactersFosterJM, Mar 13, 2014

M - Smooth light body with a light astringency near the finish
O - Good amount of maple with enough smokiness to balanced it out. Didn't think it had a lot of coffee but still a really good and flavorful porter 437 charactersjeonseh, Mar 10, 2014

The smell is just unbelievable, loads of maple, smoke, and of course the coffee. The flavor is very similar and it's damn near perfect. The feel of the beer is a bit of a sipper but it's nice to enjoy something as flavorful as this is. Overall it's truly outstanding in my opinion. 397 charactersKnapp85, Mar 09, 2014

poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: light black bodied beer with 2 full fingers of light to medium tan colored head.
Smell: Boatloads of sweet maple. Light meaty smoke and light roasty malt. Chocolate chips. Dont smell much coffee in this beer, but I dont really care. The aroma of maple coming from this beer is truely hypnotic. 
Taste: The beer starts off with sweet maple syrup; Smokey and roasty malts in the middle. Vanilla, cola, and chocolate chips with bacon in the finish. I am a little bit surprised that I dont taste much coffee in this beer.
Mouthfeel: low end of a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation levels. The beer feels creamy and soft on the palate. Mouthcoating feel. This beer is super drinkable; so drinkable that I could probably drink a bomber of this in 20 minutes by myself. 
Overall: This is my first Funky Buddha beer and I gotta say that they nailed that authentic maple syrup aroma and flavor. Toppling Goliath is the only other brewery that can captured that maple syrup flavor and aroma in a beer. Great balance in reguards to the flavor profile and aroma from this beer; everything is well integrated. Funky Buddha has some great finesse that is showcased with this beer. This beer has bigger maple flavor than CBS, but it does not quite make it to the level of Toppling Goliath's Mornin Delight and Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout. So this is my 3rd favorite beer that is brewed with maple syrup as a brewing adjunct. Fantastic job Funky Buddha; I will be seeking out more of this beer. No doubt about it. 1,611 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jan 30, 2014

So, great anticipation on the first bottling of a beer that I have wanted and am now finally able to get the chance to try.
Lovely bottle with a picture of a pig and the Buddha prominently displayed as I crack open and pour three ways into awaiting Selinsgrove snifters.
A - Pours cola brown/black with a small head that pulls back to a slightly oily lacing of bubbles in the glass.
S - Maple and coffee dominate the nose and it smells like a wonderful Saturday breakfast of hotcakes and coffee awaiting you after a morning of snow shoveling. Very enticing and it triggers a desire to quickly get this beverage into your mouth.
T - I loved it. Maple, coffee, and a slight smokiness are all there. Each of the flavors sits separate and distinct so that you can clearly taste each. Was not sure of how the bacon would appear but it is a pleasant smokiness that is not over the top but instead compliments the waves of maple and coffee. I think that this beer presents the maple in the way that many wanted the bottles of Canadian Breakfast Stout to do. Some might complain about it possibly being a tad sweet from the maple and they might be right, but I think the coffee pulls it back just enough and allows for the interaction of flavors to be just about perfect.
M - Very nice and wonderful for the style. You might think it should be slightly fuller but for a porter it is rich and smooth. No complaints here at all.
O - I thought this was great and so happy to have finally had the chance to get this. Eagerly looking forward to a couple of more bottles that will be in transit soon and hope that this becomes a regular bottle offering. I had high expectations and they were certainly met and more. This Buddha fan is happy! 1,902 charactersBeerisheaven, Jan 26, 2014

pours dark with a nice head... smell is quite big on chocolate. the taste is extremely nice. very smooth. chocolate up front hits you as well as a great coffee flavor but where this beer shines is the finish. the maple is extremely detectable and smooth on the finish and it lingers for a good while afterwards. really excellent. medium body with the correct carbonation.
overall an impressively complex beer with a great feel. very recommended! 517 charactersAxnjxn, Jan 26, 2014

4.49/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25APPEARANCE- dark dark dark; completely opaque, almost black. Minimal head and carbonation.
SMELL- the name says it...maple, bacon and coffee. You'll want to have it for breakfast.
TASTE- definitely more of the "maple" and "coffee" taste, rather than "bacon" - the bacon part of the name comes mostly from the savory smokey smell. Maple probably brings to mind something super sweet, which, in my opinion, would ruin the taste of a good beer. But never fear, this is far from sweet. Nice, strong, and perfectly mixed porter.
MOUTHFEEL - quite smooth and a surprisingly easy drink, considering its super dark color. I tend to like my brews a bit more carbonated (but that is a personal preference).
One of those beers that you never knew what you were missing until you've had it. And then you want it regularly. 816 characterskarabearaesquire, Jan 19, 2014

A: Very dark brown to black, opaque. Forms a nice one-finger tan head with average retention, and just a few bubbles are seen wandering up the sides.
S: Dark roasted coffee, dark amber maple syrup, and breakfast cereal malts. Yum - sweet maple in coffee.
T: Maple, coffee, dark roasted malts, sweet maple syrup, with a touch of salty and smoky flavors towards the end. Roasted bitterness and malt sweetness in the hang.
M: Medium body for style, but while it's not the thickest porter out there, it coats the sides of the glass very nicely. Average carbonation, and alcohol presence is low.
O: As always - so tasty, so different. A very well-made, enjoyable beer. Highly recommended. 750 charactersmacrosmatic, Jan 13, 2014

Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, maple, bacon, smoke, and coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with maple, coffee, and smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a phenomenal smell and tasty flavors that are exactly what the name implies. 666 charactersUCLABrewN84, Dec 16, 2013

They only release it on special occasions. A lot of people were waiting for the keg to be tapped. There was even a count down. It has a great nose. The second it started pouring the smell of maple filled the tap room. It was very pleasant. The taste is really good too. A very bold maple taste the leads into a nice coffee taste and is finished with a smokey flavor. There is not too much bacon flavor for those people who are put off by that aspect. The looks are nothing special. Not too much of a head, but overall it is a really great beer. 620 charactersAndrew180j, Dec 10, 2013

S: Maple is the first aroma to come off this beer and there is a lot of it. There was some smoke, dark roasted gains, and coffee in the background of the nose.
T: Huge coffee flavors here. There is not a whole lot of maple in the taste but the nose balances it out. Very complex beer that has a changing flavor throughout.
M: A medium body with a little silkiness to it. The carbonation was perfect.
O: A very good beer. I am glad that I actively pursued this one for about 8 months. Well worth it. 569 charactersjvillefan, Dec 06, 2013

A - Pours near black in color showing just the faintest hint of brown on the edges. Two fingers of densely foamed dark tan head shows good staying power and an almost whipped creamy consistency. Foamy webs of lacing coat the sides of the glass almost entirely.
S - From clear across the room you can clearly smell this beer...there is nothing subtle about it. Great thing is this smells absolutely heavenly. Rich coffee that relaxes into an amazing mocha with chocolately sweetness blended really well. Maple is intense, but not at all overpowering - blends seamlessly. Not really picking up any smoky or bacony aromas, but it hardly matters. Funky Buddha succeeds again in creating a beer that has such an intense, almost excessive aroma - I really don't know how they this much aromatic goodness into their beers. Smells like the perfect breakfast coffee drink.
T - Black coffee up front, slightly acidic and roasty. Sweet maple and Hershey's syrup like chocolate smooth the intense coffee and give this an overall sweet impression. Although sweet, it seems in perfect balance - again, like a perfectly sweetened coffee drink. The maple lingers through to the finish and wafts up into the nose and gives a lasting maple impression. Mild cocoa impression that is reminiscient of a dusting of cocoa powder on top of a cappuccino. The bacon aspects are lost on me as I really get no bacony, smokiness at all...and I am looking for it heavily. There is no trace of alcohol at all.
M - A bit thinner than medium bodied with a lowish medium level carbonation that is fluffy and foamy in the mouth. Acidic black coffee character with a complexity of sweet flavors that complement so well.
O - This is a super tasty treat...another winner from Funky Buddha in my book. Amazing aroma and a flavor that is intense and full of complexity and nuances. Best utilization of maple in a beer that I can remember having. This is truly outstanding. Funky Buddha hasn't let me down let. Wish I had a way of getting more their beers easily. 2,105 charactersportia99, Nov 23, 2013

A: Pours jet black, An aggressive pour provides little to no head. 
S: Maple & smoke dominate with some coffee aroma making its way through.
T: incredible how all these ingredients provide such a strong milk chocolate flavor, with coffee, sweetness from the maple and perhaps a bit to much smoke for my liking
M: My favorite part of this beer is the mouthfeel, full & rich, with little carbonation, exactly how I want a porter to be.
O: Really glad I got a chance to try this beer, a little disappointed as I had wanted to be blown away. Seems a little overrated based on the reviews but that's just my taste.

A- Pours a dark blackish brown with some translucency around the edges, the first two pours didn't have too much head, the third pour had a thin mocha head that had great retention.
S- Nice coffee presence, balanced maple syrup that provides a nice sweetness, very subtle bacon that blends in with the maple syrup presence and evens out the sweetness a bit. Nice aroma strength only complaint is could get a little bit more bacon.
T- Lots of coffee, slight chocolate, subtle blended maple syrup, a bit of cream. Awesome taste for a breakfast beer, the bacon is tough to detect but balances the sweetness nicely.
M- Very drinkable, fairly subtle carbonation, smooth.
O- For a coffee porter MBCP is fantastic and easily one of the best beers out there. For a gimmicky beer the bacon doesn't come out as much as I'd hope for but the coffee and maple syrup make the perfect breakfast beer. I've had this beer in years past and I feel like I've detected bacon more before but this bottling is still fantastic and worth trying, just make sure you drink it fresh! 1,174 charactersjaasen64, Apr 05, 2013

A- Pours an opaque black with a 1/4 inch tan head that soon dissipates to a thin rig around the edge of the glass and a small patch if light surface foam.
S- The best, most fresh coffee aroma I've ever smelled from a beer. Very rich milk chocolate mingles with the sweet maple.
T- The coffee rushes in with a scrumptious roastiness, then comes the maple bringing the sweet. Both meld together in a heavenly synthesis making for a damn drinkable beer. Not as much smoke as I was expecting, making it really a maple coffee porter with a hint of bacon.
M- Superbly creamy and full with low carbonation.
O- I drove through a hailstorm just to get the chance to try this and I'm so glad I did. Worth the money, the hype and the trouble. 813 charactersImmortale25, Apr 04, 2013

Nice creamy foamy head, fades at a med pace nice lighter lacing, pitch black beer.
Nose is awesome, amazing, tons of maple, nice maple bacon thing, lots of brown sugar, fluffy caramel nutty malts, light peanut butter and hint sweet syrupy thing, hint cocoa and vanilla, some light roasted coffee beans and fresh brewed coffee.
Taste is sweet, big nutty malts, peanut butter and maple syrup, caramel, little molasses, tons of melted brown sugar, some lighter smoked malt for a bit of bacon, some decent coffee like fresh brewed, little earthy grainy flavor, light yeasty addition of chewy bready flavor. Fairly sweet almost candy like, maple candies, light fig like too. Then light earthy hint spicy hops, some bitterness. Finish is semi sweet and sticky but drier, lingering light bitterness, dark malts, light peanuts, more maple and light bacon, brown sugar, etc.
Mouth is fuller bod, thick and little syrupy, nice carb that has a bite to it, the more I drink and since rudzud pointed it out maybe a bit too much carb.
Overall great beer. very tasty, although probably couldn't drink more than a glass full. 1,237 charactersjlindros, Mar 25, 2013

Shared with JLindros and poured into Kate the Great tulip. 
A - Poured a nice deep dark brownish black hue with a half finger mocha head that fades to leave a nice thin halo and spotty clouds.
S - Aromas of huge maple notes and lots of sweet black coffee reminiscent of a coffee hard candy. Very sweet on the nose with a light hint on smoke. Really though this is tons of maple.
T - Taste is a slight let down from the nose. Lots of maple here but not as potent as the nose but with nice vanilla notes, light smoke soft chocolate. Super tasty. Light nutty notes as well.
M - Mouthfeel is super nice and carbonated considering it was hand filled. Almost more carbonated than I would expect from a porter.
O - Overall this beer is every bit as deserving of the hype and delivers what it promises. I would like more bacon/smoke notes but I'll forgive it for being so maple heavy. Just delicious and honored to have tried this brew. 1,097 charactersrudzud, Mar 24, 2013

Appearance - Black with a nice khaki head. Thick collar. Dark in here, so it's tough to see it, really.
Smell - Coffee isn't as strong as most coffee stouts. Much more earthy. Maple adds sweetness and it gets cut by a hint of smoke, but that's the least dominant of the aromas.
Taste - Coffee up front and it comes back in the finish. Maple and malt sweetness. Chocolate malt. Maple sweetness lingers long after each sip. Smoked flavor is more predominant and cuts the sugars nicely.
Mouthfeel - At points a little thin and over carbonated, but I could drink it all day.
Overall - Another beer from the Buddha where all the adjuncts are in perfect balance. They must pour maple syrup right into the keg to get that kind of flavor out of it. 805 charactersAlieniloquium, Feb 28, 2013

One of the best porters i have ever had. I must of had 4 samples of this beer...very drinkable. Pours a very dark brown almost black. The smell is divine with huge notes of maple and coffee. The initial taste starts off with heavy maple and coffee giving way to a smokey taste at the very end. I wish they would distribute their beers throughout most of Florida. I am a big fan. 494 charactersFlorida_SC_Trojan, Feb 19, 2013

Gotta love a label that's pretty much just a piece of scotch tape with magic marker... Anyway, this stuff pours a brackish black-brown topped by a half-finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises rich cocoa, caramel, maple syrup, molasses, and Reese's peanut butter cups. Everything is richer than the thickest fudge I've ever had. Da-amn. The taste pretty much brings in more of the same, producing a veritable liquid version of a hot fudge sundae smothered in rich caramel sauce, with a tall coffee to drink and a side of maple-smoked bacon. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a fantastic beer, one I wish I could encapsulate in a candle or a spray or a spread or something, any way to keep it around as long as possible. 798 charactersTMoney2591, Feb 17, 2013

Maple comes through the strongest with coffee and chocolate following things up. Not getting much bacon character on the nose. The taste on the other hand features some smokey bacon quality along with plenty of maple sweetness and a nice amount of coffee which balances out the sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. Overall, delicious and perhaps one of the most unique beers I have had the pleasure of trying. 530 charactershomebrew311, Feb 16, 2013

S: Maple, coffee, and a slight smokiness. But damn, there is a lot of maple!
T: Taste is moderately sweet. Starts off with a blend of sweet, roasted malts, and maple essence. Then there is the coffee and a slight char that i think is supposed to resemble the bacon. 
M: On the heavier side of medium. Coffee acidity mixed with a light sweetness. 
O: Another very nice beer. As I'm sure many others have noted, this is like breakfast in a bottle, not that I've ever stirred my coffee with a piece of bacon, but you get the point. 622 charactersFlorida9, Feb 16, 2013

The body sits an ink black with a foamy light tan head. Some clingy lace as it falls.
The smell of maple was strong with this one. Arms length, maple was permeating the immediate area. Upon closer inspection, I also get notes of smoke, fresh coffee beans, and milk chocolate. 
This beer really needs to be close to room temp to fully enjoy. At first, the liquid was way too cold, so I gave it a good ten minutes before diving back in. Milk chocolate and maple up front with coffee and some smokey notes in the finish. A light lingering roast/smoke flavor with some sweet maple syrup. The maple notes do a great job of balancing all of the bitterness from the coffee, roast, and smoke flavors. It hovers above the rest, infiltrating all aspects of the flavor profile.
Full body, smooth, and creamy. Mild carbonation.
The maple syrup really stands out here. It is extremely prevalent in every aspect, and never to a point of being overbearing. The underlying complexities work well with the sweetness of the syrup to provide a well-rounded brew that I will seek out again. 1,101 charactersColForbinBC, Nov 01, 2012

Taste is thinner, lemon, watery, full of astringent coffee that gets a little harsh. Definitely some interesting coffee used and bound to be a big hit if ever bottled. Would like to retry with more carbonation. 5/16/2011 8/3/6/3/14=3.4
Tap at Churchkey. Unfortunately, this beer's debut at CK was a disaster. This smelled like green coffee and mega DMS. Body was super thin. Undrinkable. Will not rate. 684 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

A - Pours very dark brown, might as well be black, with a small half finger tall off white head leaving spotty streaks of lace down parts of the glass.
S - Smells of a TON of maple syrup, fresh brewed coffee, smokey dark roasted malt and a touch of chocolate malt. The rauch character grows as it sits in the glass.
T - Starts off with plenty of intense maple syrup sweetness slowly giving way to hints of coffee, chocolate and some smokey rauch malt. The "bacon" isn't very noticeable initially but it does grow stronger throughout the experience. Finish is pretty sweet with some dark roast, lingering on the palate long after the finish.
M - Big, full body with intense flavors and moderate carbonation. For being so big and flavorful it is still has a smooth feel. This one is definitely a sipper but in a good way.
O - On the way back from the bathroom I noticed that the entire bar smelled like maple syrup...pretty sure that isn't a coincidence. Other than possibly HF Ann this is the best beer I had during PBW this year. Amazing stuff. 1,159 charactersorangesol, Jul 31, 2012

The beer pours a nice dark brown and leaves lots of lacing on the snifter glass, attractive for sure. Ring of head too.
The smell is the best part of this beer, tons of maple hit me right away, with a touch of smoke plus the very solid spurting chocolate and coffee aromas. Just what you'd hope for, though some of my friends wanted more bacon in the nose, I thought it was nice.
The taste isn't quite as awesome, but still way better than your regular porter, with lots of coffee and maple at the forefront especially, some nice layers of flavor and a touch of the salty and smoky bacon too. 
Feel is very thin for me, this was somewhat surprising how this part of the beer is so average compared to the rest.
Overall a very good beer, though I wouldn't say it's worth killing yourself to trade for. I was fortunate to have it at the church key event for sure though. 977 charactersDreadnaught33, Jun 24, 2012

*From notes
A: Dark cola brown. The beer is topped with a healthy quarter finger head. A solid tan collar and reasonable lacing follow.
S: This smells just like one of those microwave pancakes that have the syrup already baked in. Huh...who the hell ever thought you could get a beer to smell quite like this? As it warms, I get hints of mild and low key smoke, green and freshly roasted coffee and a little bit of Indian spice, which I've noticed on a lot the FB's brews.
T: Extremely low key. At first, I'm not really into this. Some decent flavor here, sure. But then it happens, as the more I quaff, I quickly realize the amount of complex and balanced flavor is going into such a mild ABV beer. It begins with plenty of maple, yet it's not too sweet over the top. Some hints of smoke and a pinch of curry creep onto the mid, yet it's not overly smokey or spiced. Coffee? It's here toward the finish. It's all expertly balanced and in a nutshell, is really easy to drink while packing a ton of flavor.
M: Ouch. This can't be right. It's disappointingly thin and lacking proper carbonation. A bit oily and fairly light bodied. I'm wondering if this was tapped properly, though I wouldn't be surprised if this batch (like the rest of FB's brews this evening) was simply a bit "off" in the feel department.
O: Another longtime want ticked. God damn was I stoked to get in on this one. I'll honestly say that no, it didn't live up to the insane hype that tends to surround a beer like this. But the more I drank (and I had what...three big glasses?), the more I really began seeing what this mash-up of a beer is all about. You like breakfast? You like beer? Then look no further, as this is really one of the more unique yet quaffable gimmick beers around. 1,811 charactersRhettroactive, Jun 18, 2012

4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Churchkey during Savor week, served in a tulip. It arrived pretty close to black in color with a thin, frothy, tan colored head to it.
I immediately get smoky bacon and sweet maple in the aroma. It's got a bit of a breakfast sausage and syrup thing going on. There is a bit of roasty coffee to it along with some chocolate chip pancake notes. The maple and smoke combination is really awesome. Everything really integrates well. The flavors are bold, but don't overpower one another. Smells like an awesome breakfast. 
In the taste, more smoky with bacon and sausage come out up front with the maple sweetness more towards the finish. It's also very roasty in finish with good dose of coffee coming out. Again, an awesome breakfast is probably the best way to describe it. Also pretty well balanced for all the bold flavors. 
Mouthfeel felt thin and a little watery for the style of beer. Carbonation was on the lower side. I'm not aware if they added any oats to this or not, but a big creamy oatmeal stout mouthfeel would have gone great with this beer in my opinion. 
Overall, I thought it was a great tasting and wonderfully unique beer. It was an awesome breakfast in a glass. Everything comes together perfectly in it and I loved the smoke and maple flavors. Wish I could drink this every morning. 1,317 charactersbillab914, Jun 12, 2012

Appearance: Pours a dark brown color with a finger of off white head that fades to a ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Smooth coffee roast with some dark chocolate notes. Sweet with some maple and a nutty quality.
Taste: Very smooth with tons of coffee. Nutty and sweet with dark chocolate and some caramel. I'm getting some maple, but it doesn't slap you in the face or anything. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body with tingly carbonation and an overly dry finish.
Overall: This is one of the smoothest coffee beers I have ever had. The nuttiness from the coffee and the malt was very nice as well. I didn't feel like the bacon added much. I would love to have another. 766 charactersoline73, Jun 12, 2012

a - Pours a very dark brown color with one inch of dark tan head and low carbonation evident.
s - Smells of coffee, sweet maple, roasted malts, light smoke, vanilla, light sweet dark fruits, chocolate. Love the nose; I actually think there is less smoke than the imperial Wide Awake It's Morning version, making this nose even better. Perfect for me, just so well balanced.
t - Tastes of coffee grinds, sweet maple, sugar, roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, smoke, burnt malts, sweet fruits. Again, an awesome taste though not quite as balanced as the nose, with the coffee coming through a bit more here.
m - Medium body and low carbonation. Super smooth and creamy, and very easy to drink.
o - Overall, a fantastic beer. I actually like it better than the imperial version due to it having less smoke, and would put it up their with their Morning Wood. The nose is perfect to me; a perfect balance of sweet maple, coffee, and light smoke. Something I could definitely have a few glasses of, and one of the best maple beers out there. Would love to have it again. 1,259 charactersmdfb79, Jun 11, 2012

A- Maple Bacon Coffee Porter is a black beer, it's pretty black but I've seen blacker, but this is still on the black side. A small skim of foam up top that kinda fades leaving just black.
S- The nose on this killer. It really jumped out at me. Big scents of fresh maple from the source, dark coffee/espresso with roast and some deep rauch type malts resembling bacon, but the bacon scent needs time to come out and some imagination to make it pop out. Very bold.
T- The maple comes out ever so much to excite the palate to the core without the cloying and overabundance of southern tier creme brulee type levels. It integrates nice with the deep roasted coffee flavor with some faint vanilla. The bacon is an afterthought but give it time, it will come to you.
M- Very full on the mouth without having a total heavy body to cause a sipper of a beer.I could sip this or take small gulps without being blown away, except for the flavor which is packed. The carb is light and plays the bench after a while, which works out for the beer IMO.
D- A glass of this is fine, no need for more, like said a sipper or if you want to take it down quicker, the body wont prevent that. One of the better beers I've had all week. 1,244 charactersBARFLYB, Jun 08, 2012

Beer pours black with a medium tan head. The smell on this beer is incredible - it really smells like breakfast as the coffee and maple are both very present and combine in an amazing way. Flavor is also top notch - the coffee really comes through on the front end, and it melds into a fantastic authentic maple syrup finish. The beer does an excellent job of not being too sweet while incorporating a number of different flavors. My only complaint was that I didn't get much of the bacon here. Mouthfeel is the only real knock on this beer, as it was noticeably thinner than a beer like this should be. It took away slightly from the experience, but not so bad. Overall, this is a top-notch, unique beer that absolutely lived up to the hype. It's got probably the best maple flavor I've ever had in a beer and works incredibly well. 861 charactersstarrdogg, Jun 08, 2012
4.15/5  rDev -7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had on-tap at Woody's in Philadelphia, PA. Poured a very dark brown color, almost black with a thin head that receded almost immediately leaving the beer looking somewhat reminiscent of a black coffee. Minimal lacing. Had an aroma of coffee/roasty malts, maple and faint smoke. The coffee aroma was definitely more overpowering than the more subtle smoke/maple. The taste was that of black coffee, maple syrup and slight/faint smoke. As the beer warmed, the smoke and maple came out significantly more to create a more balanced "breakfast in a glass." Medium in body with low/no carbonation. Appropriate for a porter, though the flavors would have been even more enjoyable with a thicker mouthfeel. Overall, a great "concept beer" that was done very well. I would have preferred the maple and smoke to be a bit stronger to match the coffee flavor and balance out the beer a bit but I still enjoyed it as it was. I still think the Last Snow is a better porter, though seemingly not as well known. When you are drinking this beer, make sure you let it come up in temperature as that is when it really shines. 1,106 charactersMsRif, Jun 07, 2012
4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Hulmeville Inn for the Funky Buddha/Cigar City Philly Beer Week event. I've been waiting a few years to try this beer and almost lost my chance. A very, very busy and stressful few days culminated with me rushing to Hulmeville to get a taste of this elusive brew. The keg kicked as the gentleman in front of me ordered; I felt like I got punched in the gut. Fortunately, the awesome bartender offered me the pour that killed the keg. While I did not get a full beer, I was more than happy to enjoy the half glass of beer and head. Major thanks to the bartender!
Review:
Appearance/Mouthfeel: The beer was dark, the head tan. That's about as far as I'll go since it was the last of the keg. While I can't give in-depth observations, I do not have any complaints from what I saw. Since it was mostly foam in the glass, I didn't get a good feel of the beer. Nothing off putting about the liquid in the bottom: as much carbonation as I'd expect for this style.
Smell: The entire bar smelled of maple syrup. Dipping a nose into the glass, one picks up a tad less coffee, and faint bacon/smoke notes. The maple definitely dominates here.
Taste: Basically a diner breakfast in a glass. Again, strong maple, but the coffee is much more present here than in the nose. Bacon is hard to come by in the taste, but if you concentrate hard you can pick it out. Maybe my tastebuds are shot since I always put maple syrup on my bacon. Think Founders Breakfast Stout with a half shot of maple syrup and a strip of bacon floating in the glass.
Overall: I absolutely loved this beer and I can't wait to have it again. I enjoyed this so much it almost brought a tear to my eye. I had a smile on my face until the glass was empty: it brought up nothing but good feelings and memories. This would be a staple at every single Sunday breakfast (hell, breakfast any day of the week that ends in Y) if I could get my hands on it.
Huge thanks to the awesome bartender at Hulmeville and Funky Buddha for making this happen. 2,011 characterssifka4, Jun 05, 2012

A: Pours black like my soul. Half a finger of off whitehead no lacing.
S: like sunday morning breakfast. Strong maple and coffee with a little smokey Bacon.
T: maple syurp dominates the taste with a little coffee and smoked bacon to finish not to bitter at all.
M: Very smooth very easy to drink.
Overall this is a stellar beer. I dont think I could drink more then 2 because of the maple but totally worth trying. I've never had a maple beer that actually tasted like maple. I highly recommend this beer. Cheers!!! 558 charactersCuso, Jun 04, 2012
4.41/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25First had: oddball bottle serving from an old bottle at Pinocchio's, Media, PA (see other review below). This review is for an actual on-tap serving at Woody's, Philly, PA.
This was much different than my sample acquired from the bottle, but strangely enough...I liked the bottle better. On tap, this beer was served in a ball-stem goblet, an opaque brown-black with a small mocha head that receded to a ringlet. I think I can definitely say that this beer's best attribute is the aroma, and in more than one way. Lots of coffee up front, some sweetness, roasty malts, unfortunately not too much in the way of bacon or maple, though the maple comes out more as it warms. As I said in my previous review, the aroma of this beers lingers on whatever it touches, whether it be your glass, your clothes, or your hands, and it not only lingers, but actually seems to get better. Hours later at home, after my wife had washed her hands with Lush soap, we could still smell the maple coffee from the beer. So we sat around and just sniffed her hands for an hour or so. But I digress. 
When the beer hit the palate, it came off a bit disappointing in comparison to the aroma, but I think mainly because it wasn't as full-bodied as I expected. Coffee is the dominant factor here, lots of coffee, very roasty, and if there is any bacon or maple (anyone else stutter or perform involuntary spoonerisms when ordering this?) in there, the coffee kind of overpowers them. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it just doesn't have the balance you'd hope for. Maple comes out more as it warms, just like in the aroma. Bacon is mostly truant. Mouthfeel is heavier than medium, but not quite full. 
This is a tasty coffee porter, but definitely not the best out there. It's not even the best porter from Funky Buddha, which IMO is easily the Last Snow.
Thanks go out to Ryan and FB for bringing your great beer to Philly, and also to Bella Vista, Monk's, Capone's, Woody's, Prohibition, Devil's Den, Hulmeville, and any other provider I may have missed. 2,040 charactersRifugium, Jun 04, 2012

Pours a dark brown with a dense khaki head. Huge aromas of maple syrup with a nice dose of smokey bacon. Not getting a ton of the coffee in the nose, but I'm loving the maple and bacon.

A – Basically poured out a dark brown/black with no light showing. Half finger of tan head that receded quickly. 
S – Wow huge maple smell. Nice and sweet. Strong coffee comes next almost an espresso. Molasses as well. 
T – Follows the nose closely. Starts off with a blast of maple sweetness that immediately moved over to a hit of coffee. Strong coffee at that. Has some bitterness but not much. Sweet but not cloying. Touch of smokiness which makes you feel the bacon flavors. 
M – Medium body. Light carbonation. Don’t feel the alcohol at all. Coats the palate well. 
O – Yes it lives up to the hype. It is a great all around porter. Has all you would expect with the flavors of maple, bacon and of course coffee. It is also remarkably drinkable. Cheers. 892 charactersGallowsThief, Jan 29, 2012

Appearance is dark, not blackhole-ish but dark brown. Low head retention. 
Smell is overpowered by coffee aroma. Deep inhales detect maple and bacon on the back end. Not a huge coffee beer fan, but this one was very strong in the aroma. Would've liked it to be more balanced with the other ingredients. Name of beer is Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, in the aroma the coffee is 95%.
Taste is coffee, but not over-the-top or overpowering like the aroma. Get maple, slight bacon - not much though. Not overly sweet, low carb in the solution. 
Mouthfeel is medium, not too heavy, slightly silky. 
Overall this beer was a unique experience. Lots of coffee, would've liked to have had more bacon and maple. Seems like the maple is hard to bring out in the taste for many beers and this beer is no exception. Would recommend, fun beer, would like to try again. Great beer to share, not a lot of alcohol, wouldn't mind a bit more. 1,019 charactersCenCalMario, Nov 06, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. Thanks to paulmpapp for bringing this to our tasting.
Appearance: The pour is a fairly dark mahogany color that does not maintain in the edges. The corners are slightly transparent brown and ruby. 
Smell: There is a nice amount of smoked malt that fills up the nose. Sweet maple syrup comes through next, with roast coffee coming through at the end. The nose lives up to what this is supposed to be.
Taste: The flavor is sweet up front, with true maple syrup and dark roasted malts. The smoke comes through right away, filling up my nose and resting on the tongue. The malt has a good dark and roasted character that leads well into the coffee bitterness toward the end. The finish has more malt, and some sweet maple lingers into the coffee bitterness at the end.
Mouthfeel: If anything, the body feels a little light compared to the body. The robust flavors deserve a fuller beer. The carbonation is on the light side, and there is a moderate sweet stickiness that sticks on the lips after each sip. Even with the sweetness, the coffee really brings a dry and slightly acrid feel to it.
Overall: This is a great beer; the only thing that could really make it better would be a little bit more carbonation and a bigger body. I am definitely excited to see what the imperial version has to offer. 1,343 charactersKickInTheChalice, Oct 30, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to PaulMPap for bringing this one.
Pours out an opaque murky dark brown with light carbonation. 
Smell is incredible - bitter coffee opens the nose, but maple syrup wafts out of the glass and fills the room with a breakfasty aroma. A hint of smoke on the end.
Flavor is very impressive - dry bitter coffee, initially, then some smoke, with maple sweetness blended evenly throughout. Chocolate malt also makes an appearance. It's hard to believe this much flavor comes from a porter.
Feel is decent. Medium bodied, could use a bit more carb. There's something a bit fuzzy about the feel.
Fantastic beer. Funky Buddha continues to impress. I wish it was easier to come by. 682 charactersreadbaron, Oct 30, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I think my mouth just had an orgasm made out of chocolate velvet rainbows.
That said, this is the first beer I've ever felt compelled to review, so I may be a rookie at this, but I've got a year or more of eclectic, and, as my local beer distributor can happily attest to, copious, selection of craft ales. I went after this one in particular for two reasons... 1) I love maple syrup (bacon doesn't count as a second reason, because it's a given), and 2) the hype. 
I am here to tell you the hype is indeed real.
I was so worried that I'd built it up so far in my head that when I inevitably popped the top, there'd be no way it could stand up to my preconceptions. In fact, I waited a good two weeks after finally snagging a bottle before actually opening it, because I was almost certain there was no way it could stand up to the hype.
The moment I popped that cap it all faded away. The smell was exactly as described in all the best reviews... breakfast in a bottle. Coffee, maple... a touch of maybe cinnamon, deep caramel... (I dunno who has caramel with breakfast, but hey, it's caramel, can't go wrong). Chocolate, omg, the chocolate. Double rainbow chocolate.
When I finally came down after sniffing it like a kindergartner with a fresh bottle of Elmer's, I actually poured it out, only momentarily forgetting you could actually DRINK it and not just bask in the scent. It poured out looking just like it was coming out of a fresh pot of coffee. And I mean just that... it was the same color and appearance of that perfectly brewed pot my mother always makes when the family gets together on holidays, that I can never seem to replicate on my own. I give it less than a 5 only because, based on the style, I expected it to pour a bit thicker. It was actually prettier than I expected, but I'm trying to score to the style, and also looking for reasons not to give it all 5's and completely ruin my credibility heh.
I looked at it for a while, feeling like Indiana Jones eyeing the idol with a sack of sand in one hand, wondering exactly how I was going to take something so enticingly beautiful completely into my possession without something going horribly wrong to muck it all up.
I needn't have worried, there was no giant stone ball... though I was indeed bowled over. Not only did it live up to the hype, it went above and beyond. Because until it actually passed my lips and sent me to a happy place that would put Happy Gilmore's to shame, I really couldn't quite comprehend how amazingly the flavors could complement one another and go beyond to something even better. The chocolate, the caramel... they blend with the coffee to keep the coffee flavor but smoothe out the bitterness... the maple sweetens the pot without the cloying taste I've found in some other maple-kissed ales. The bacon... quite honestly, I can't really say I taste the bacon. There's a certain smokiness that seems to act as a... a... bonding agent? Ecosystem? Je ne sais quois? No idea, but it swirls around the whole thing, permeating each sip, and it seems like it's what holds everything else in place. It's like the lines of sheet music that notes are written on. As it has a smokey taste to it I assume it's the bacon, but its bacon in function, not form, if that makes sense to anyone without a mind as weird as mine.
Anyway, I was downing it about as fast as if it were Tim Powers' Herzwesten Dark and I was a grail king. Before I knew it, I was more than halfway though my glass (one of those Sam Adams Boston Lager jobs) and the initial mouthgasm had fled my senses enough that I could think somewhat straight again and start slowing down to appreciate it on levels below the plainly mystical realm I was floating in.
And so I came here. I'm not a professional beer reviewer... hell, until just now, like I said, I've never reviewed a beer. I've read hundreds of reviews and always boggled at how people are able to put their tasting experiences into descriptive words. And so, this is not that kind of review... there are plenty other reviews in this thread that have it covered better than I could. No, this is just a review from a guy who wanted to let everyone out there wondering if it was worth it, that is is indeed worth it.
So, if anyone out there was considering selling a kidney, or possibly a neighbor's kidney, or hell, even the whole neighbor, in an effort to get their hands on a bottle, growler, thimble, upturned hollow Barbie-doll head, open palm, whatever... that it is COMPLETELY worth it.
Just don't sell an of the sensory organs required to experience this liquid Nirvana. 4,614 charactersMystikCelt, Oct 29, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours an extremely dark brown, almost black color with a small white head. In the nose, I immediately get bacon and maple syrup which instantly transition into fresh brewed coffee. Fresh coffee grounds and maple syrup make this one inviting porter. Taste is initially a heavy maple profile, quickly followed by delicious coffee. Best coffee flavors I've ever received from a beer. Lovely complex blend of coffee and maple syrup. Breakfast made perfect. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with smooth finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, I know this is a bold statement (no pun intended)... But best coffee beer I've ever had. 624 charactersDovaliHops, Oct 18, 2011

Appearance: Dark brown, almost black, subtle mahogany hue. Pours no head and no lacing.
Smell: Maple at first, then lots of fresh coffee grounds, chocolate, espresso, maybe a hint of bacon.
Taste: Coffee is dominant, espresso, chocolate, subtle saltiness, maple.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, very smooth/creamy. minimal carbonation.
Overall: Wow. This beer totally delivers. Coffee Maple Bacon(Saltiness) all present. Probably the best coffee beer I've ever had. 487 charactersphichifiji00, Oct 17, 2011
1.95/5  rDev -56.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 1 | feel: 2 |  overall: 1.5Guess I need to review this one again...
First off, yes, this did sit in my cellar (and its a real cellar) for like three months before the chances came around to opening it.
A: Nice dark brown with ruby highlights. Good carbonation upon pouring but not much staying power.
S: Smells very much like I remember. Coffee aromas are not as intoxicating, a little more stale perhaps, but still nice. Maple is there just like before. I'd say it was a lot like the fresh growler, only significantly more muted.
T: I almost spit this out. Completely lactic. First sip was shockingly tart. To make matters worse, it still has the deeply roasted coffee flavor, some sweetness from the maple syrup, and the salt presence of bacon. This has soured, and not in a good way. Drainpour, and I hardly ever do this.
M: Much thinner than I remembered. Something is definitely in here destroying this delicious beer.
O: Was not expecting it to live up to last time, but this is in no way what I wanted. At first I tried to pretend that time had not treated this beer weel, after awhile though it became apparent that it had been infected. Too bad, was such a great beer the way it was meant to be... 1,185 charactersDrazzamatazz, Oct 09, 2011

Bottle shared by a generous Adam, thanks! Snifter.
A: Dark brown with a small beige head that quickly recedes.
S: A blast of maple, which smells amazing. It reminds me of maple syrup. Wow. There's a pervasive roast with a nice earthy coffee profile. A light smokiness wafts from the glass and it does smell a bit like bacon. This is amazing.
T: Earthy coffee with huge maple presence in the flavor. Lightly smoky with a moderate roast. Doesn't match the aroma, but it's undeniably excellent. Dark chocolate is evident. Alcohol is nowhere to be found in the flavor.
M: Upper medium in body with upper moderate carbonation. 
Overall: This is awesome. Breakfast in a glass. I didn't expect this to be as good as it sounds, but it is. The maple is really powerful in both the aroma and the flavor but it lacks the sweetness one might expect. Highly recommended. 1,049 charactersHopHead84, Sep 19, 2011
4.28/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 432oz. Growler drank the day it arrived thanks to Jay.
Pours a transparent chestnut brown with a toffee colored decent sized head. Above average retention and lacing. A nice looking beer.
Aroma is pretty dominant coffee with also a healthy dose of maple syrup. Its actually weird, one sniff will be all coffee the next sniff is all maple. Eventually as it warmed just the faintest bacon smoke comes through. My only real complaint is the coffee aroma is somewhat stale but not enough to make it terrible.
The coffee dominates the taste more than the aroma. Its still a bit stale and last from beginning to end. The maple flavor comes towards the end and lends a nice perceived sweetness and balances out the coffee bitterness. 
Mouthfeel and carbonation is great, even for a semi leaky growler. Pretty velverty smooth and medium thick mouthfeel without lasting a bitterness.
Overall a really great beer with more maple flavor than I've ever had in a beer. 959 charactersweatherdog, Aug 26, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the lounge.
Darkest deepest brown, black. The dark atmosphere of the lounge (badass place) didnt help to show any other hues. Little khaki head up top when I got it, falls down to nothing over a minute. Mild amount of lacing as consumed.
The nose is a huge mix of coffee maple, & molasses. I zoned in to find the smoked/roasted aroma & found it. But the two dominant players here are the coffee & maple for sure.
Taste follows the nose. Very sweet beer! "Wow" is all I remember thinking when I smelled & tasted this. "How the hell did they get those flavors in a porter?!?!?" Roast coffee up front & very sweet molasses on the back end.
I would say this is on the thicker side (7/10), but not too bad. Just very sweet! Definitely found this to be more of a dessert beer than something I could finish a few pints of.
One thing is for sure - this is a very unique & delicious beer. Is it worth all the hype & praise? In my opinion, no. But that is just my opinion. All in all, its a great American Porter & pushes the boundaries for what a "beer" can bring to the table. Hats off to the Funky Buddha for helping to open pandoras box in the brewing world. 1,167 charactershoptualBrew, Aug 12, 2011

Was poured a very full glass with almost no head (not complaining about a big pour). Spilled a little on my fingers, which smelled like maple for the next 4 days. Kind of weird. Heavy maple aroma and flavor with roasted coffee up front transitioning to very heavy coffee flavor on the back end. Did not sense anything from the bacon. Light but pleasant mouth feel - helped to balance the distinct flavors. Very drinkable, but you better like the flavors. 499 charactersDelraypete, Aug 08, 2011

A - Pours dark brown, almost black with a reddish hue when held up to the light. A finger width tan head is persistent throughout with spotty lacing that clings to the glass.
S - The initial aroma is a double shot of espresso, followed by the sweet aroma of pure maple syrup and then some dark chocolate rounding out the nose.
T - The nose was a great indicator of just what this beer was going to taste like. Again, coffee up front, followed by some sweet malt, sugary maple syrup and just a very small hint of smoke on the back end. 
M - Medium bodied with light carbonation. No alcohol warmth was present...very nicely balanced.
O - My initial hopes before even trying this beer was for a pronounced bacon / smokiness profile, but it really wasn't there the way I had imagined. All in all, this is still one very tasty Porter and one that I will actively seek out any chance I get. 1,015 charactersJefe73, Jul 15, 2011

4.49/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Finally decided to open this one and give it a whirl with some friends. 
As I opened the bottle I was compelled to stick my nose in it out of intrigue. Wow, big whiffs of Aunt Jemima maple syrup and strong black coffee immediately.
poured into a couple of 4oz taster glasses. Medium bodied consistency, small amounts of head and lacing. Root beer brown in color. 
Took another hit of the smell from the glass, More maple, bolder coffee and now hints of smokiness, (bacon?) I could tell this will amazing when it warms a little.
The taste was surprising. Love the maple presence but the bold coffee flavor added a slight bitterness. The smokiness was less present in the taste but balanced well with the coffee and maple. All of these flavors were enhanced as the temp increased. Mouthfeel was a little thin but very pleasing.
I really enjoyed this unique brew as did my friends. I'm sad to look at the now empty bottle and hope to land another some day. Definitely recommend it. 983 charactersSiggy125, Jul 04, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Got this in a trade from a generous BA. Brought to a tasting at BeerThursdays residence. 
From notes:
Aroma was a very strong maple syrup. Smells sweet. Not much somkeyness. Faint coffee scent.
Tastes was damn good. Not quite breakfast in a bottle, but awfully close. Coffee, chocolate, maple syrup. Again, not as smokey as I had expected, but don't think that's really a bad thing. Just expected a stronger presence with bacon in the name. I was thinking more Rauchbier. 
Mouthfeel was rich and thick, coats along the way down.
Overall I really enjoyed this one. Only request would be a little more heat. Maybe raise the abv to 8%. This one was hard to get a hold of, but I'm hoping another opportunity pops up 716 characterspwoody11, Jun 28, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to UrbanCaver for bringing this to a Jackie O's tasting in May (thanks Cam!). Along with Chocolate Rain this was one of the main events.
Dark brown color, nearly black, extremely dark for a porter. Holy shit does this smell appetizing. So rich, so much maple, also ample amounts of bacon smoke and roasted malts, if this doesn't earn a perfect score on smell then I don't know what does. Coffee too, but honestly I've never tried a beer with such an appealing maple nose.
And it tastes just as good as it smells. Each particular flavor is easily discernable, maple, coffee, roasted malt, smoked meats, everything. This is another perfect 5.
Oily mouthfeel, if anything this only adds to the amazingness that is this beer. It coats and sticks to your tongue, keeping those rich flavors for along aftertaste. Not sure what other praise I can heap on this, an extremely good and flavorful beer that you can drink for a long time given the relatively low ABV. Awesome. 979 charactersTurdFurgison, Jun 20, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle from a kind trader - thanks for the swap! Poured into my snifter and sampled over the course of an hour and a half. This beer has a myriad of flavors and opens up well, with a nice evolution across the tasting experience.
Things start off well, with a dark brown, almost black colored beer sitting in the glass. There's a bit of light passing through on the edges but the center is pretty opaque. The beer features an off white head but that subsides too quickly leaving just a bit of lace in its wake.
My first impression of the smell is that this is certainly unique, almost odd but pleasant and cool. The dominant note is a fresh coffee smell
that's dripping with maple sweetness. There's more sweet maple than in any beer I've ever had. Couple that with a hint of fruitiness and a touch of smoke and you get a beer that truly stands out. That is to say this beer is unique (but unfortunately not jaw-droppingly amazing) but the nicely expressive notes of the elements the name promised assures this beer a score better than just good!
The taste throws me off for a second. I instantly get a sweet cola syrup or a sweet berry or prune note that just seems out of place. Just as I notice this oddity, the maple explodes with sweetness, creating a taste that is simply the best defined maple ever in a beer. A touch of coffee and smoke at the end round out one of the most unique beers ever. 
The mouthfeel wasn't as strong as the flavor and smell, but still was pleasant. The beer is a touch thin and sticky but nice carb keeps things moving along. The viscosity is OK for a porter but a breakfast beer could use some heft. Overall, I liked this beer a lot but didn't think it was deserving of the insane hype. Unique for sure, but nothing like the experience of my first Founders Breakfast Stout. 1,815 charactersjampics2, Jun 08, 2011
4.29/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks for pwoody11 for sharing this bottle.
A - Pours a very dark brown with a finger of macho head which faded quickly to some spotty lacing.
S - This really blew me away. Even when I opened the bottle, all I could smell was maple. The pour revealed the coffee and there was still quite a strong scent of maple syrup. There is also some chocolate and sweet sugary smells.
T - Tastes like Maple syrup and coffee. Very very good, but actually a bit disappointing. The flavors are there, but not quite as strong as in the nose. The sweetness really comes forward. Caramel, chocolate and the sugary maple syrup blend well with the coffee. Very nice combination of flavors, just not as strong as I would have though.
M - A bit heavy for 6.3%, which could be from the bacon weighing it down. It's hard to render out all of the fat, and that could lead to a thicker MF than would otherwise be present. The bacon almost hurts the beer, and the maple and coffee go so well together. 
O - Very good, rare experience. I know of a few other companies who are doing the same sort of thing, and this one is probably the best I've had. The maple syrup thing is very exciting, just hope they can bring up the ABV a bit to give it more of a bite. 1,236 charactersBeerThursdays, Jun 01, 2011

A: Deep brown, near black with a fine layer of mocha colored head. Solid head retention but minimal lacing.
S: As soon as I opened the bottle I got hit with a giant wave of maple syrup and waffles. A nice roasty coffee note is present as well and just a hint of smokiness as well to represent the bacon.
T: Much as the smell, it was breakfast in a glass. My biggest critique is that the smokiness and bacon aspect of it wasnt as present as i was expecting but this was still a great porter non the less
M: Rich and creamy, goes down very smooth.

Poured a dark brown with little head that dissapated quickly. Slight lacing most likely from the maple. What impressed me the most about this beer was the incredible nose of maple and coffee. Slight smokiness to it. Similar to the smell coffee, maple and bacon on the back palate. Moderate carbonation and very easy to get down. Would love to try this again and it is a great porter. 432 charactersmistakebythelake, May 21, 2011

Tastes sweet maple goodness with tons and tons of coffee not the tongue. A touch of smokiness which is great but subtle. Icredible flavour profile.
Sweet and thick on the tongue. I wish it was a hair thicker but overall one of the best beers I've ever had 455 charactersUrbancaver, May 21, 2011

4.94/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Such a fun time hangin with Calton and enjoying this one during hobo tasting number 8. this may very well have been one of the best beers i have ever had, hands down. just simply superb in every way. served into two pint glasses and enjoyed on 4/30
the pour was a thick dark motor oil brown with loads of lacing coating the sides and just a really sticky, messy look to it that seemed to plop down in the glass like sludge.
as i reach in to catch a wiff i am overloaded on maple syrup. i have never had a beer have this much maple in it. it was was really simply amazing. so sweet and full of everything, i cannot say enough good things about this one, it really was simply amazing. as it warmed, molasses, dark chocolate, loads of roasted malts and vanilla with coffee and espresso overload start to take shape. this carries over into the flavor which mirrors the heavy maple and brown sugar so perfectly i was simply blown away. each sip was like heaven on earth, a wonderful mix of rich flavors and sweet, decadent dessert like taste. this was more then a beer, this was an expeirence. 
overall i really do not know what else i can say, this was quite simply one of the best beers i have ever had. absolutely amazing in every way. 1,236 charactersmikesgroove, May 04, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Massive thanks goes out to my boy mikesgroove for sharing this one with me during Hobo Tasting #8 sitting in the car at Lowe's before buying a grill (hobos gotta eat too). Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a half finger slightly tan off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and maple syrup. The flavor was of sweet malt, maple syrup, coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, and a very subtle smokey note. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was just plain excellent. The flavor on this thing was crazy good. Maple syrup was the star of the show, but definitely not overpoweringly sweet as you would expect allowing some more of the sublte flavors to come through. The aroma just gives you a small hint at what is about to explode on your palate. Really glad I finally got a chance to try this brew and would love to do so again! Also, how can a beer with a bottle label that awesome be bad!? Excellent job Funky Buddha! 1,132 charactersthagr81us, May 03, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into my Maudite tulip. Big thanks to Ryan at FB for sending me this bottle.
A - Non descript, dark brown to light black with brown edging against the light. Tan head was only about 1/2" thick and didn't stay around long, minimal to no lacing
S - Probably the best beer I have ever smelled to date. Incredible layers of maple and coffee. The bacon isn't picked up as much, very faint. 
T/M - This thing is just as advertised. Incredible. The main flavour I picked up first was the rich, woody, sappy maple. The cold coffee was also there in a supporting role and man it was balanced perfectly. I do pick up a slight fatty saltiness but it was just enough to tease you and not enough to make the beer taste like a piece of bacon was used to stir it. The balance of the flavours was extremely well executed. This couldn't have been easy due to the individual strength of these flavours. I was glad that I didn't find it overly sweet, it is sweet, but not cloying. A nice, full, creamy beer.
O - This beer is amazing. The balance is great and it is a very intriguing beer. The nose is worth any effort to get it. Top 1 or 2 beer I have ever had.
Thanks again Ryan and great work! 1,199 charactersOakedCanuck, May 02, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Kevin at the Funky Buddha. I was in Boca for work, stopped in to try their house brews and hoped to get a taste of the this particular example since I missed it at Cigar City. 
Popped a 12oz counter pressure filled bottle with friends back in Sarasota, poured black as night with light carbonation.
Floored by the coffee aroma, I haven't come across a brew with similar roasted coffee characteristics… almost as if you're smelling freshly ground, roasted beans with a hint of maple that follows.
Like others have said, the aroma matches the taste. Very coffee forward, followed by the taste of maple syrup and a salt flavor which I would guess to be the bacon. As the beer warmed to a little below room temp, the maple became much more pronounced, pushing the coffee to the back a bit.
Mouthfeel was on par with decent porters. Not too thick and not too thin, this particular batch seemed to get it right with the perfect amount of carbonation. 
Overall I'm grateful for the opportunity to try this brew, it pushes the boundaries of what's possible with porters and brewing in general. Great job, and I will seek this out again, and hope to try the imperial version as well. 1,191 charactersDeltaFoxtrot, Apr 21, 2011

S-WOW, the smell is great. Smeels of coffee. almost like a starbucks frappachino that you buy in those glass jars at gas station. You can smell the maple also. No bacon smell coming though. OVerall the smell is so delightful
T-Coffee flavor hits you right up front then the smooth maple comes in second then it finish's with a saltness. A saltness thats like cured meat. Which must be the bacon. 
M-Medium bodied, has a thick mouthfell
D- OVerall this is an outstanding porter, not too watered down like some and not too coffee flavored like others. And the savory saltness is something ive never tasted in a beer. The only complaint i have is i wish the bacon flavor was alittle more present, But overall this was an outstanding porter ad glad i was able to trade for it. IM proud thatthis beer could be my 100th Review. Please try and get this beer, u wont be dissapointed 952 characterszrab11, Apr 21, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz “growler” popped open and poured into a snifter. The beer pours a jet black color and is surprisingly viscous looking for the style. I was worried about carbonation issues on the trip over here but it turned out just fine. A small, one finger, tan head rises from the pour and quickly fades away. A little bit of soapy lacing is left on the glass. 
The nose on this beer is THE most maple driven beer I have ever come across. It smells like sweet, rich maple syrup; better yet, bacon that has been soaked in maple syrup. The bacon aspect gives a lightly smoky and salty smell. Along with this come the other usual suspects, coffee and chocolate. The smell, oddly enough, is nearly identical to a McGriddle; if you don’t know what this is, you clearly are not fat enough…
The taste is nearly indistinguishable from the nose. The one key difference is that the taste is quite a bit drier than the nose leads on to. Once again, it tastes like a big bite of a McGriddle, followed by a sip of black coffee. Awesome biscuity flavors with rich maple syrup, smoky bacon, and a dry, bitter coffee profile come together for a fantastical experience in the mouth. 
The mouthfeel was spot on for carbonation however proved to be slightly drier than I was hoping for. I would have liked a bit of a sweeter profile, but that’s just me.
Overall – WOW. What an amazing beer. This is probably the best beer I have had this year, and it possesses a nose like no other. I need to get this again! 1,497 charactersmjn5036, Apr 16, 2011

The beer is jet black and very little carbonation and no lacing on the glass. 
Very strong coffee aroma. The taste of coffee overwhelms the beer.
Did not pick up roast and malt character from the grains just over-powering coffee. It tasted like drinking a cold flat cup of coffee with a hint maple syrup. The beer is a sipper, taking over an hour to get through the glass. I would not consider this beer a porter due to the lack of drinkability. 475 charactersanycrew, Apr 14, 2011

This beer in my opinion has THE BEST SMELL EVER for a beer, there i said it! It really does smell like breakfast complete with coffee, pancakes and bacon. Got 2 bottles at the house and am trying my hardest not to drink any of them right this minute!!!
Pours black as night with very little head, i usually just sit there for the first 5 minutes and take in the smell. Can't wait for the imperial version!!! 480 characterscalcio360jrd, Apr 14, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Had this on-tap at the Lounge. 
Appearance: Jet black, no real head just very small dark tan bubble on the edge of tulip glass
Smell: First off is the coffee, slight roast/maple/sweet/toffee aroma, more than anything a sweet roast coffee, very complex aroma especially as it warms
Taste: Again, coffe is in the forefront, then the roasted grain and porter flavors, your get a hint of maple but not much, does a good job at being sweet while having a dry and drinkable finish. Excellent flavor. 
Mouthfeel: Good, but the lack of carbonation hurts this beer, overall though nice mouthfeel that has substance without being thick. 
Overall: A great success I would say, excellent beer. Only criticism is the carbonation and maybe a hint too much coffee for my taste (I think this hurts the overall complexity a bit, maple flavors for instance). 845 characterslandhoney, Apr 12, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Drove over an hour for this. Poured on tap at The Funky Buddha into a snifter. An imperial version is in the works!
Dark brown with pretty much no head. A quick swirl brings up a mocha colored half-finger.
Took the smallest whiff and WOAH! Olfactory overload! If I had closed my eyes I would have sworn I was smelling a fresh cup of coffee with just a hint of maple... like when you can't help but get sticky maple syrup all over the handle of your mug o' joe at breakfast and you end up smelling it when you take a sip. You know what I'm talking about...
A small taste and... SAVORY (umami), BITTER and SWEET! That's 3 out of 5 of the primary tastes all in one glass. I get the bitter coffee notes balanced by sweet malts and maple, rounded out by a hint of smoked protein... you know the one.
Mouthfeel is good... not very thick, little carbonation. Could be a little thicker. The thin character definitely makes it more drinkable so I see the intention there, but I mean... I want to be able to use a utensil on this sucker//. Sorry, I had to stop typing to smell the maple syrup on my fingers.
Best Porter I've ever had. Would love to have a hint of oak in there as well. 1,180 charactersMufflnMan, Apr 11, 2011

Thanks Drazzamatazz for saving this one, probably the highlight and was a great way to start the meeting!
Pours a dark brown color with a small bit of head in my taster glass, not much lacing produced from the 2-3oz pour.
Smell is incredible, huge whiff of coffee dominants with a bit of sweetness cutting the coffee bitterness thanks to the maple presence, not picking up any bacon though, grrr!
Taste follows up on the aroma with a strong coffee kick, rounds out with a nice roasted malt backing and a touch of maple sweetness, still not getting any bacon flavor, not sure if that's a good thing or not considering bacon is quite salty and might not fit with the other flavors, carbonation is soft but present although porters tend to have higher carbonation than this, still it works for this beer and gives it a creamier mouthfeel than it would be otherwise.
The bacon in the name is certainly for hype, but this beer makes up for it by actually being a really great beer. Glad I got to try this before the insane hype started to kick in. 1,170 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Mar 16, 2011

A - Pours a medium brown color, off-white head that vanishes quickly that leaves a few bubbles here and there on top with no lacing.
S - Who needs to eat breakfast when you have this? Bacon, coffee, roasted malts, smoke.
T - Lots going on here and comparable to the nose. Bacon, smoke, coffee notes, malts, some sweetness in there too.
M - Light, a bit too thin for the style, little to no carbonation.
D - Had one sample and that was enough. I wish it was a bit more thick and had a touch of carbonation. Otherwise, a very cool beer that I'd try again if given the chance. 611 charactersSean9689, Mar 14, 2011

A: Dark dark brown with a head that went away real quick. If they actually brewed with bacon that might have affected the head retention.
S: Good lord the name is spot on. Maple syrup, bacon and coffee all waft from the glass
T: Just like the smell, the tastes blasts you with syrup, bacon, and coffee, and in that order. My one criticism would be that it was too powerful. I was completely overtaken with the taste of breakfast in a bottle, but what a great breakfast it was.
M: Thick and fitting for a beer with a name like this and taste like this.
D: I've seen others say it was highly drinkable, so I guess to each his own. I thought it was best at half a glass, splitting with someone else. The taste is too overpowering beyond that. Good sipper though. Would be a fabulous breakfast beer if it ever got bottled. 843 charactersgodfathermg57, Mar 13, 2011

A: Holly breakfast batman! I could smell the maple from 5 feet away. This smells absolutely heavanly! Big coffee, maple syrup, and smoke. I mean it's just off the hook.
T: again pretty much breakfast in porter form. More maple syrup, coffee, and bacon. Great roasted malt profile and next to no hop presence. Finishes sweet and delicious!
M: a touch thin, light body. Good levels of carbonation.
D and overall impression: I could drink this stuff all day long, it's not just for breakfast. Overall, this is a hit. Original and well crafted. It really is breakfast in a glass. Get it if you can. Skal. 728 charactersGtreid, Mar 13, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Hunahpu's Day 2011.
Pours a muddy brown color with minimal head. The nose on this is absurd. The name doesn't lie, this smells like a delicious breakfast spread. Coffee and maple syrup dominate the nose. The taste is just fantastic. It just tastes like breakfast! The bacon comes through a lot more on the taste, adding some great smokiness to prevent the maple from becoming cloying. I spilled a little bit on my hands, and they still smell like syrup. Very good.
The mouthfeel is perfect, it's actually a bit lighter and thinner than the name would let on, which is a very good thing. If this had a full and thick mouthfeel, I think the maple syrup would be way too cloying, the mouthfeel accents all the right parts of the brew as-is. The drinkability is superb, especially considering the full flavor of the brew. An awesome porter, very unique and absolutely worth seeking out. 894 charactersshand, Mar 12, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Draft at Cigar City, Hunahpu Day 2011.
Pours a deep dark chocolate brown color which is completely opaque with a one finger frothy micha headthat quickly settles into a lasting ring. Minimal spots of lacing left behind.
Wow, the aroma of this beer is ridiculous! Slightly roasty and smokey with a blast of chocolate/mocha/espresso. Not burnt or acrid smelling at all with lots of luscious chocolate, roasted espresso bean and sweet maple syrup. Kind of smells like a Southern Tier dessert beer.
Medium bodied with a smooth silky roasted chocolate mocha espresso flavor. Very well balanced with the perfect roasted character, sweet malt and maple. Thankfully the coffee presence is prominent without being overly acrid or tasting like used coffee grinds. Lots of silky, luscious milk and bittersweet chocolate flavor as well as some slight smokiness and sweet maple. With bacon in the name I was expecting this beer to be more robust, smokey and burnt tasting but it's just a touch and a very nice compliment to the sweeter flavors. No noticeable alcohol heat making this smooth beer very quaffable.
Overall, I was pretty impressed with this one. It doesn't quite live up to the extremely high scores it's received so far but it's pretty damn good. Even somefolks who hate coffee beers were really into it. 1,309 characterscorby112, Mar 12, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 432 oz screw-top growler into a couple of tulip glasses. Big thanks go to Stakem for generously sharing this with me. 
Pours black at first, but holding it up to the light actually reveals a deep ruby hue to this, and is topped with a ½ finger of light mocha colored head. This stays frothy on the edges, with a filmy look across the center. This has a very robust flare-up to it, leaving back a foamy cascade of lacing that slowly recedes into rich swathes of lacing. I can't quite put my finger on this recognizable aroma at first, until I realize that it smells....LIKE BREAKFAST!!! Bacon and sausage mixed with maple syrup covered chocolate chip pancakes and a dash of zippy coffee character. Oh, and just a smidge of earthy hop across the back of the nose to remind you that your actually smelling a beer! 
The taste brings things back down to reality a bit. The smoky flavors are more subtle here and hang on the edges of a core of roasted coffee, light bitter hops, and sweet chocolate. That molasses flavor is present as well but doesn't quite stand out, instead integrating itself with all of the other flavors a bit more. Smoke and coffee hang in a rather dry finish. All of those flavors from the nose are present and balanced with each other but this just overall lacks the impact of that aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, maybe a touch fuller feeling, with a nice mellow creaminess to the carbonation. Some light sharpness works itself in to, adding a gentle crispness to the proceedings, and zero alcohol presence helps keep this easy in the mouth and quite drinkable. 
While this one didn't quite live up to the hype, I still found it very impressive how they were able to pull all of these unique flavors off into a very interesting yet still approachable drinkable package. That's 2 for 2 so far on these Funky Buddha beers for me. I will continue to seek more of these out. 1,899 charactersKegatron, Mar 09, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to DosBeerigos for the trade and the opportunity to give this brewery a try. I've held on to this 32oz "apothecary" growler for too long just waiting to share it with someone. Finally an opportunity to open and share it when visited by Kegatron! 
From the screwtop growled into a pair of snifters, this brew appears nearly black in color with brown clarity showing through the edges. When held to the light this brew reveals some deep ruby coloration. A dark whisp of dark brown head holds close to the edges of the glass with spotty lace clinging to the wall. A swirl revives the cap. 
The smell of this brew has quite a lot going on. It takes me quite a few sniffs before I try to pick it apart. It has a mildly musty grain scent that's blended in with a seemingly smoked sweetness of molasses. There is a bit of a woodsy scent reminiscent rauchbiers that is smokey and enjoyable. There is an underlying amount of coffee present that adds to the complexity.
The taste of this brew is equally perplexing, complex and enjoyable as the aroma. There is a light burnt flavor upfront that gives way to a smoked quality coupled with light molasses character that again reveals a bit of some smokey notes. There is a modest amount of bitterness that creates a unique blend of roasted malt to sugary molasses and coffee. The aftertaste of this brew is sweet with caramel malt mixed with molasses. Quite a bit more woodsy in the way it tastes than what I was expecting but still enjoyable.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Very drinkable with quite a lot of flavoring to take in and enjoy. This beer, while a pleasure to drink and something I would certainly seek out again, was a wild ride. Take away the visual and I never really felt like I was drinking a porter. In so many ways this brew reminds me of the conglomeration of different beer styles that makes up Bullfrog's Gothika. It's a crazy hybrid of rauchbier/smoked beer mixed with a porter and supplemented with coffee and molasses. In every way this brew screams morning/breakfast treat. 2,084 charactersstakem, Mar 09, 2011

Poured in a tasting tulip. pours a pitch black with minimal head. was poured pretty soft since it was a tasting glass.
the nose is amazing... light roasted coffee followed by a hint a sweetness and a tad of smoke.
the taste is amazing. all of the different aspects of the beer come through at different stages of the taste. First you get the coffee on the front/ initial taste. Then as it moves back in the mouth the maple sweetness takes over ( but not in an over powering way like a creme brulee) then after you swallow and breath a little but the smoke (savory bacon) hits the back of the throat!
This is one amazing beer for sure! Glad i was able to try it. 761 characterspastradul, Feb 16, 2011

Beer is black / dark brown and hazy with a thin wispy head, no lacing, low carbonation. Looks OK.
Aroma is super nice and really complex. First off, it's strong with coffee, the maple is second but there is not much bacon though.
Beer is medium in body and so creamy, as the beer warms the maple becomes more obvious. The maple is mostly in the back / aftertaste as the beer finishes mildly dry. The coffee and some sweetness is the most obvious flavors in the entire palate. I really liked this beer overall. A very good beer. 586 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 15, 2011

Pours a very dark brown with a nice tan head and a bit of spotty lacing. Thin collar as it goes down. Nose is quite incredible with large doses of vanilla, smoke, and coffee off the front end. As it warms up, the maple really starts to come out. Very, very nice. The flavor hits the same high notes with a good dosing of roast and coffee plus some maple. Not as much smokiness here. Mouthfeel is medium with a dry finish and moderate carbonation. Incredibly drinkable and we certainly had no problem finishing off this 32-ounce growler.

A: Pitch black with lighter head than I expected. Light carbonation but tough to gauge from a growler.
S: Strong dark roasted coffee beans, baking chocolate, wondering if the taste will have this much coffee. 
T: Coffee and vanilla up front, nestle cocoa powder in the middle, with some maple presence in the throat on way down. Maple eaves a sweetness behind. Not picking up bacon but to be honest I'm a vegetarian and may not be the best judge of that (hoping they didn't use real bacon in the brewing:) 
M: Appropriate mouthfeel and carbonation. Smooth...brewed with lactose?? Almost like a milk porter!
D: This is a delicious beer. All the components come together for an amazing drinking experience. Although I think this beer is best appreciated in small amounts, I could drink it every night. It would make a great dessert beer and would pair wonderfully with some vanilla ice cream. 
Although I would have liked more smokiness from a beer labeled "bacon" this still was tastier than I expected. I can't wait to try other offerings from Funky Buddha. 1,160 charactersthe_beerist, Feb 12, 2011

This very intriguing brew appears a dark brown shade, with crimson highlights apparent when held to the light. The head is about a quarter inch thick, and settles down to a thin layer atop the beer. The smell is just awesome. Wow! Scents of maple, vanilla, smoke, chocolate and a robust coffee presence make for a world class aroma. The taste does not disappoint, though it doesn't quite live up to the promises of the fabulous aroma. Fresh coffee and maple syrup are blended to perfection, with some chocolate and vanilla notes coming in behind. I actually thought this beer was higher in alcohol. Highly drinkable - I could sip this all night. In fact, that's what I did. 716 charactersHuhzubendah, Feb 12, 2011

A. Pours a dark dark brown with a white head. Great retention and lacing. 
S. HUGE espresso more than coffee as the name may suggest up front. Maple syrup and a decent amount of roastiness. More maple as it warms.
T. Espresso, maple syrup and more espresso on the tongue. Some typical porter roast. Good choice of yeast as I dont get that typical porter dirt taste. As, it warms, I get a ton more maple.
M- I think this is what makes the beer for me. It is soooo stinkin smooth. The carbonation is perfect. Its creamy for such as small beer. I love the mouthfeel.
D-I would love this beer all day everday. Its small enough to have several of them, but has enough flavor to be able to enjoy several of them. Not much bacon, but a great beer from South Florida, breaking the shell of a beer wasteland. BOOM 874 charactersdrink1121, Feb 07, 2011
5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I don't normally take the time to review a beer, but this one is exceptional. I've been fortunate to have 2 different batches at the brewpub and both have well exceeded my expectations.
Served in a snifter
The first thing that hits you is the amazing aroma, like you are inhaling a stack of maple syrup covered pancakes...underneath you get a hint of the bacon.
In the taste, more of the maple and lots of coffee.
A phenomenal beer. If my wife would let me (and there was more of it to go around) I would drink one everyday for breakfast.
Thanks, Funky Buddha! 563 charactersScorpwood, Feb 01, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow! I typically do not review beers, but this beer is an exception.
Had this beer yesterday at the Jupiter Craft Brewers Festival. The line was insane to get a sample of this beer, and the keg went quick! 
Poured a dark brown almost black, with a nice amount of head to the tasting glass. The aroma was filled with coffee, maple syrup, and hints of smoke. This is a breakfast beer! The taste was unlike anything that I have had before. Lots of maple syrup on the initial taste, then followed up with some serious coffee notes. Simply Amazing!
I went back for a second taste and the keg was kicked!
This was the best beer at the festival, it was the most drinkable out of all the big stouts which were being poured (Hunahpu, Big Bear's Imperial Stout, Swamp Heads Midnight Oil Treatment, and several other stouts/porters). Just a fantastic beer! 849 charactersScooterShooter42, Jan 30, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The smell of this beer is... wow. It reminds me of breakfast. coffee and maple eminate so wonderfully from this beer. I didn't pick out the bacon so much but it didn't even matter, it was that good. For a brewery that has only been open since November; they certainly can brew an amazing beer. I loved that it had so much flavor but as soon as it was gone; it was gone. I had an IPA right after it and there was no lingering taste at all. drinkability was good, it was definitly a full-bodied beer with a ton of distinct flavors, one was enough for me as it was on the heavier side. but it was a great one! 606 charactersTwiztidstyle, Jan 29, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: black as night. thin mocha colored head. its very alluring, maimly because of the smell emenating that backs up the opal black liquid.
S: black coffee, espresso, chocolate, maple backbone... its
so intense overall however the bacon fails to come through no matter how hard i try to find it. i almost tell myself i get it mainly because i want to, but still cant.
T: holy crap its so good. again unfortunately i dont really get the bacon, but i may just be so focused on the intensity of all the other flavors whirling around. it screams black coffee of the finest kind, just the right amount of bittering chocolate, and the maple serves as a balance for the whole shebang. so. delicious.
M: its heavier than your usual porter, but this is no ordinary porter, so it can do whatever it wants. its every move is spectacular, as the flavors crowd your mouth, but when its time to go, they go. sometimes coffee beers can just linger a little too long with the bitterness, but this one does not do so.
D: drink it all night. nuff said. 1,032 charactersKkottonmouthkngz, Jan 29, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Snoop Dog Nate for hooking us up with this, and another shout out to Alex, Jason, and Nate again for not drinking the whole thing, and the Master(Ski)ful Alex one more time for bringing a bit back in the growler.
A - Pours a super dark, black depending on the light, brown that lets some light pass through the edges. Finger of tan head that left behind some long lasting spots throughout consumption.
S - Smell was a bit of a shocker, and took me a second to figure out exactly what was going on. Perfect blend of coffee and maple syrup. It's almost like it's a new substance, they are combined so well. Bitter chocolte, distinct espresso (somehow still a separate note from the coffee/maple combo), and some sweet malt top it all off. Not sure where the bacon is on this one.
T - Taste follows suite with the smell. The coffee and bitter espresso notes tone down the sweetness of a strikingly present maple syrup. I would call the coffee on this the backbone, with chocolate, maple, caramel, and milk creamer in there. My one complaint on this fantastic taste is the absence of any type of bacon, smoke, pig, grease, rauch, whatever, something to make sense of th name. I guess it's hard to complain about what's not there given all the great stuff that is, but the name is misleading at worst, but at the very least, confusing.
M - Full bodied, chewy, syrupy, tongue coating, with low carbonation. Feels a bit heftier than its 6.3%.
D - A truly fantastic beer, best maple beer I have had to date. Would highly recommend and drink every chance I get. For their next trick, I hope they add some subtle smoke to it, to make it match the name. 1,661 charactersAgentZero, Jan 23, 2011

This is a very solid beer, but everything I got from it was very nice coffee porter with a little bit of smoke. While smelling and sipping, hoping to get some bacon, I might have caught a little whiff but never in the flavor. And I completely forgot about maple. I didn't catch maple at all...at all. 340 charactersa74gent, Jan 23, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Nate for procuring this. 32oz growler, served in a New Belgium tulip.
A - Pours to a finger-plus of tan foam that settles to a thick cap, leaving behind spotty lace. The body is a very dark brown that is a little lighter at the fringes.
S - Huge wonderful delicious roasted coffee beans mixed with maple syrup, and some peripheral chocolate and caramel flavors as well. Not much "bacon" (or smoke, hickory, etc.), but this smells so good that I don't care about the absence of pork products.
T - The taste has more maple sweetness than the nose, but there is still a nice balance of roast coffee bitterness and malt and syrupy sweetness. Again - where's the beef, err, bacon? Probably a 4.25 in this department, but I'll be generous seeing as this is a new brewery.
M - Medium bodied, with a chewy, sticky, texture. There's some roast coffee grit to it, and a lingering syrupy finish. Carbonation is fairly low.
D - This was quite good, although the richness of flavor would make it hard to drink a ton. Still, I'm impressed - great coffee and maple flavors that are well-attenuated. Would love to have this one again. 1,138 charactersMasterSki, Jan 23, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.532oz Florida growler poured into Matilda glass, thanks again karl! Pours black with brown edges and a creamy tan/white head with very nice retention. Smell is sweet maple right off the bat, lots of coffee, a nice smokey, fatty bacon, followed by a porter malt character. Taste is lots of strong flavors that somehow dont overpower each other. Maple and coffee up front, finishes with a good strong porter malt base beer, very nice. Some roasted and chocolate malt but not a lot of hops. I expected there to be more of a smokey malt flavor, but the "bacon" is subtle, which is probably for the best. Too much bacon would ruin the beer. A bitter coffee finish with a maple aftertaste. Medium bodied with a fine light bubbly carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. I thought this beer was going to be gimmicky but it is actually an excellent beer. Very balanced and just as described, my only thought is that this beer could use a bit more smoke to add to the complexity. I look forward to trying more funky buddha beers. 1,012 charactersnkersten, Jan 23, 2011
4.76/5  rDev +6.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 52nd tasting on tap at Hunaphu. Orignal score was 4.33, had to adjust up accordingly. Incredibly tastey and crushable. 
Big time thanks to Nate who was able to land this after I failed with several attempts. 32oz "Florida" growler into a Matilda tulip...A dark brown, almost black pour. A very light tan head rises about half a finger but stays with a great cap, ok lacing...The aroma is star of this beer. Huge notes of freshly ground coffee, slightly roasted, bold. The finish brings about wonderfully subtle maple syrup. The sweetness breaks the coffee up nicely. Most maple syrup is used heavy handily, this is done right. One would almost want more but it would really become to sweet in my opinion. Slightly smokey as well, but bothers me as I can't help but ask where is the bacon?...The taste is almost as good, but doesn't quite carry the weight on the nose. Coffee again is the main player, comes across more roasted now, but still freshly brewed. Sweet finish again, a hint of smoke. Basically, the nose, just not as good...Mouthfeel is ok, good carbonation, but the body is too light, not much of a finish...Easy to drink!
This is really good, and close to being world class. The name throws me the most and without the bacon reference I would have probably rated higher as going in I was expecting more smoke or some salty pork so I feel a little let down, if that's possible. I would certainly drink this again and recommend it highly. Just forget the name going in. 1,481 charactersjrallen34, Jan 23, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Look is a dark brownish-black, like a soda of some sort. Moderate tan head that degenerated rapidly into a light lace.
The smell is clearly. dominated by coffee. Some chocolate, and just a hint of smoke.
The first sip is dominated by a moderate strength coffee, though it is complemented by notes of dark chocolate, smoke, and a bacon-like grease. About half way through I started noticing some mild maple notes, but they really take a back seat to the coffee and chocolate. A moderate bit more bitter than many of the reviews here mention, but still a sweet beer to be sure. 
About as think and carbonated (moderate on both counts) as you'd expect given the style.
Highly drinkable. I expected to hate this, and originally planned to share this with multiple people until my plans fell through. I have to say, I'm glad that change came about, as this is the rare beer I can actually enjoy a liter of and still want more. 
This is in the 94th percentile of beers I've tried to date. One of the few I would gladly drink again. 1,030 charactersbeerindex, Jan 22, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to electrobunny for the growler!
Served slightly chilled into a Cigar City snifter (thanks Paul!). Forms about a fingers worth of white head that eventually fades to a thin film across an essentially black body. Leaves some nice waves of lacing.
The nose is filled with well roasted coffee beans and a bit of chocolate. Some sweet malts, possibly the maple, come out as well. Just a hint of smoke.
Tipping back the glass reveals an awesome medley of bacon, chocolate and sweet maple on the finish. This is some tasty stuff right here. The chocolate and bacon hit the tongue first, followed by light smokiness and sweet maple. Light espresso throughout. Delicious.
Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with light carbonation. Has a good body for a 6% porter. Quite smooth.
Drinkability is great! Funky Buddha has managed to pack a lot of flavor into a 6% beer. This is dangerously sessionable. Abuliarose and I will have no problem finishing off the 32 oz growler in front of us. I really wish these guys were closer to New Hampshire. I'll definitely be seeking out more of their beer in the future. Highly recommended. An exceptional American Porter. 1,155 characterssisuspeed, Jan 20, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a snifter, revealing opaque blackish brown body under a finger or so of thick crema head. Pretty lacing. Very dark and serious looking for a porter. Smells like a triple maple latte with a slight salted/smoked essence to it... the bacon? Smoked sea salt caramel? Extra dark chocolate-coated maple toffee/coffee? All of those things.
Tastes sweet and I have to say, probably the closest to sexy I have ever tasted from a beer. Big maple presence of the assertive Grade B variety with a nice raw woodiness underneath. Nice smoked presence, some saltiness and raw chocolate flavors intermingle with a savory layered malt backbone. Finishes clean with a kiss of coffee acidity to cleanse the palate, otherwise the coffee is perfectly integrated. This beer is packed with flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little creamy, a little drying with a medium body in a syrup-evoking sense. Carbonation adds to the creaminess. Very drinkable and packed with flavor for a 6.3% porter.
Overall I am quite impressed. It sounded like one of those beers that puts a bunch of stuff in but falls apart in the process. It's actually really, really well done. Wish I had more. 1,167 charactersabuliarose, Jan 20, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A- Black, 1 finger head that faded quickly
S- Alot of breakfast smell, mostly coffee and maple and a little of the bacon
T- Great. Kind of like french toast and coffee. I don't get alot of the bacon but definitely alot of breakfast feel to it.
M- Alot of the maple comes out on the backend. Probably call it medium bodied.
D- I was really hoping I didn't like this beer TOO much as it's not overly available to me, but I do. So it looks like i'll be trading for this one again in the future if possible. Very drinkable and I could easily put several of these down in a night.
Much thanks to Electrobunny for the trade and Funky Buddha for making this outstanding brew! 673 charactersRick187, Jan 19, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Had this on tap at the brewery
A - Great mahogany body with some caramel edges and a thin lacing. 
S - Smells outfreakingstanding. Bold coffee grains accompanied by smoke, dark chocolate and burnt sugar. 
T - Definitely trumps the Piiti Porter as my favorite. Rich coffee notes gnaw on the palette through every taste. Dark chocolate, smoke, roasted nut and earth comes through towards the finish. Really started to pick up the maple as it warmed but the bacon/cured ham wasn't as prominent as I expected. Every time I stuck my nose in the glass for a sip all I could think of were pancakes and coffee. 
M - Slick on the tongue with a medium body and mild carbonation.
D- Really happy I got to try this when it debuted. Highly drinkable and true to its name. I think if it had just a little more body it would be lights out. Can't wait to have this again. 860 characterselectrobunny, Jan 11, 2011

Appears near black with a loose tannish head. Only slight lacing.
The smell is huge. Coffee obviously, some coffee grounds, some chocolate, maple, a little smoke - A lot going on in the glass. Taste is rich coffee instantly the some chocolate, maple, smoke the other flavors join the orchestra.
The body is medium, mild carbonation. A smooth beer.
Overall very interesting and enjoyable. It should be tried if you get the opportunity. 480 charactersThirstyBird, Dec 23, 2010

Pours the color and clarity of cola with some ruby red highlights around the edges and no head. Big coffee grounds character in the nose, with a hint of chocolate that gives it just a kiss of a mocha character. Taste reveals dark malts and a big maple syrup character, some earthiness and quite a bit of chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a pleasant, even carbonation.

4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.532oz Growler from ... the man himself, funkybuddha.
First off -- awesome growler. Slight but promising hiss when I open the top.
Pour is a deep brown, large bubbles from a vigorous pour mixing with a thin but dense head that rises up after it hits the glass. Aroma is an intense coffee with hints of brown sugar and smoke. Taste is terrific -- while still cold it's a rich coffee with a chocolately finish and a touch of smoke. The maple comes out as it warms with a rich maple sugar element coming up in the finish and the coffee mellowing out to let some of the sweetness and just a touch of heat through. Mouthfeel is low carbonation (expected for the growler), but rich and verging on the edge of viscous. Supports the roasty coffee edge well. Smoke comes through more on the nose than on the tongue. When I finish the glass the aroma of maple and bacon persists... gotta clean this before moving on. Drinkability is phenomenal.
I'm not usually huge on multiple-flavor products, but this is a gem. Already planning on asking for more... 1,043 charactersjedwards, Dec 16, 2010

4.89/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I had this beer courtesy of Kevin from the Funky Buddha, at the tasting I went to on Sunday. This was an "experimental" batch of the Piiti Porter. The beer was aged on a breakfast coffee that has hints of Bacon, Maple Syrup, and Strong Coffee.
Now I love the standard Piiti Porter, but hot damn this beer is amazing! Honestly, if breakfast in a beer is possible, I think it has finally been accomplished. The guys at the Funky buddha brought home the bacon (pun intended) with this beer.
The upfront taste was one of a standard coffee porter, then the maple syrup flavor comes in, and the leads back to coffee on the finish. Looking for the bacon was a challenge, and it mainly comes across in the nose.
Simply put, This is what breakfast beers should be!
If you are in the area jump on this soon, as from what I understand there is about 10 gallons total. Depending on the response they will brew it again. I have my fingers crossed that they do brew it again! 967 charactersDosBeerigos, Oct 20, 2010
