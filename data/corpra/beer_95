A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice hazy golden copper hue with a good one finger white head that fades to leave good wisps and lacing. 
S - Aromas of huge acid notes, excellent cheesy barnyard funk. Excellent almost grapefruit like aroma, hay, very fruity. The beer just pops with Drie Fontain.
T - Taste is similar to the nose, really good acidity with excellent funk. Really good barnyard funk nice cheesy funk. The fruity notes are excellent with good grapefruit citrus notes.
M - Mouthfeel is lowly carbonated, a bit slick.
O - Overall this was a very good Belgium beer, excellent funk. Really glad I got to try this beer!

Bottled 8/04/2004, don't remember how I got this
Pours light fizzy head that fades fairly quickly, hazy orange slight amber color, and even has good lacing.
Nose is incredible, basically the epitome of everything good about gueuze, some horse blanket funk, cheesy funk, big tart fruit, sour acidic funk, aged lactic acetic acid, an acidic citrus grapefruit, kiwi berry fruit, aged funk, just yes!
Taste is very tart, tons of grapefruit rind, super bitter funky fruit, big farmhouse funk, horse blanket, cheesy funk, big vinous grape skin, tons of funk, great gueuze typical Drie Fonteinen at its best. Finish is dry big funk, little flemmy and acidic, fruit, grapefruit.
Mouth is med to lighter bod, lighter carb though, typical acidity flemmy
Overall just ridiculous, I'm so glad I got to drink this. Wish I could make this into a candle and candy to smell and suck on all the time. 968 charactersjlindros, Dec 04, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52012 version, at Lambik-o-droom. Slightly hazy dark golden color with creamy beige head. Aroma starts with hay, dry meadow flowers, unripe stonefruits and some lemon. Taste starts tart upfront with unripe fruits, but also with a fruit pits, seeds and skin bitterness. Hay and farmhouse notes throughout, funky but not too extreme. Light to medium body, dry, light to medium carbonation. A really well rounded gueuze, sour but quite easy to drink, funky but not cloying. 469 charactersCiocanelu, Oct 29, 2016

Oak barrel brings a bit of sweetness, balancing the other flavors.  The combination of tart, bitter, funk, and oak for this particular beer was great; one of the best beers I've had yet. 322 charactersdomdomdomdom, Jun 29, 2016

Damp, musty basement, mushroom-y, cheesy funk, but with more intensity than the regular Oude Gueuze upon first whiff. An unexpected wave of honey is also mixed into the initial gueuze-y funk, with some tart lemon nearby the end as expected.
A lot more acidic than I expected, and more notes of vinegar than the regular Oude Gueuze. Here's the kicker -- it's surprisingly sweet. The tried and true oak, funky cheese, and leather flavors follow. Wow I must be a goddamn masochist to enjoy these kind of flavors in a beer.
Medium body, well-carbonated, and dry to the bone on the finish; my lips did pucker quite a bit toward the end, but not as much as it would with American Wilds. 773 charactersamano_h, Feb 19, 2016

Hard to imagine an improvement on the regular Oude Geuze from 3F, but this one delivers. Everything is more subtle and complex than the regular and there is a much deeper golden color. I'm really glad I was able to pick this one up from 3F. Could easily drink only this beer for the rest of my life. 411 charactersKevin-1989, Nov 25, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is a pinnacle of gooziness. Extremely complex and sophisticated. The funk and sour components are well balanced. The funkiness is especially rich and wonderful compared to many other lesser gueuzes -- hay, barnyard and cheese but no off notes. Seek this out. Excellent. 274 charactersjjdc, Oct 10, 2015

Taste was more mellow, had a good hearty/sour taste but not a lot bite.  Not very smooth, but that could be age.  Amazing and a great experience. 262 charactersmrn1ceguy, Aug 23, 2015

Not the slightest bit of pop when removing the cork. Pours a flat, super clear golden color on first pour. Nice color and clarity, but a somewhat alarming lack of carbonation. Smell is of tart lemons, hay, grass, and lactic sourness. Very complex smell overall, seems "mature" to me. The taste is quite sour with tart lemons being most prevalent, followed by fresh cut grass and dried hay notes. The mouthfeel is almost totally flat, as expected, and light bodied. Overall, a very nice sour that did not disappoint. Had it retained any carbonation, it might have been truly exceptional. All the same, really glad to have tried it. 661 characterszhanson88, May 14, 2015

Appearance is a cloudy golden orange color, one inch bubbly white head, great retention, some lacing at first too

Taste starts off with tart green apples, lemon dominates the middle, more citrus in the finish with oak rounding out the aftertaste
Mouthfeel is tart, dry, and funky, medium bodied, appropriate amount of carbonation for the style, taste lingers, thirst quenching

4.72/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75750ml bottle of the 2007 vintage. Bottled 12/27/2007. Poured into a Drie Fonteinen stemmed glass 9/5/2014.
A- Beautiful hazy light copper-orange body. Three finger effervescent white head with great retention time. Not much lacing. [4.25]
S- As soon as the bottle is opened, the entire room was filled up by a citrusy funk. Very potent nose. Essentially, lemon zest, white wine grape must, musty cheese, oak, leather, funk. Incredible. This may very well be the best smelling geuze I've come across. [4.75]
F- Distinctly flavourful; very potent yet subtle. Tangerines, lemon zest, musty cheese, musty hay, oak, lather. Plenty of that signature Drie Fonteinen funk. Good amount of acidity but at the same time, it leaves your mouth wanting more. This is a true pleasure to drink in its complexity and power; especially when compared other sour beers in the same sitting- it is powerful, complex yet subtle enough that it does not overpower your palate and your drinking sensibilities. [4.75]
M- Medium body, perfectly carbonated- slightly prickly yet has a soft and billowy feel. The refreshingly dry citrus and oaky finish leaves you wanting more. [4.75]
O- I've not had the others, but the 2007 vintage is a clear home-run and deserves to be in the conversation with the other top lambics such as Lente and Zomer. Geuezes don't usually have a ton of variability in what flavours and aromas you can expect from them, but Armand seems to always find these barrels/blends where the best parts of the lambics are accentuated whilst minimizing the lesser aspects that might be there. World class. [4.75]
Final score: 4.725
Additional review: Oude Geuze Vintage 2012, 75cl cork and caged bottle, served in a 3F stemmed glass. Pours a medium orange-yellow body, one finger white head, excellent retention and lots of lacing. Picture perfect. Smell is sharp lemon, citrus, medium cheesy funk, moderate acetic acidity, oak, light mushroom, earth, touch of citrus rind. All kinds of things are going on here, and it's really something to behold. Flavour is phenomenal and just as complex as it smells; it softens slightly over time as it warms; a lot of lemon, citrus, and more damp oak and cheesy funk is apparent as the beer decants itself in the glass. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp and moderately dry, yet very refreshing. It's intense but not to the point of mouthpuckering, but it has a ton of complexity and depth to it. 2,430 charactersStevedore, Sep 23, 2014

Pours a clear darker golden orange. A thin creamy white cap sticks around fairly well.
Deep musty mildew funk. Some peach and apple fruitiness.
Flavor is light on the tartness. Dominated by funk quality. 
Carbonation has fallen out some leaving it pretty smooth in the mouth. Dry. 
Pretty damn refined right now. Quite a treat to try. 357 charactersMattSweatshirt, Jul 31, 2014

My affected senses were overcome by varying shades of peach, apricot, and a stunning variety of stone fruit, both real and imaginary, dancing upon a canvass of tart, freshly hung on the wall of a musty barn.
I do not deceive you when I say that the finish lingered on my palate for days, even after sipping on many other formidable concoctions. 
It might be the greatest beer I have ever had. 478 charactersWantonFaun, May 24, 2014

The aroma was heavy on the funk. Almost off stinky sock and attic.
The flavor follows with that heavy stinky stock quality. There's a sour quality throughout, along with a light malt backbone. It has a good amount of carbonation despite being so old and it even has some lingering notes of mint and herbal.
This beer certainly tastes different from the original brew. Whether it is more enjoyable is up for debate. 442 charactersdar482, May 19, 2014

Quick review from written notes, 2008 vintage.
Bright saturated golden orange, spotty lacing around the edges, visible carb trails rising in the glass. Foam subsided rapidly.
Mineral and sulfur traces in the nose, wet hay, lightly funky.
Sour grapefruit, lemon pith, bitter woody tannins towards the end. Clean and crisp, very smooth with a bone dry finish. Body is supple and full at the same time. Overall this was nice to try, it seems like a case of emperors new clothes, but it's a classic Drie Fonteinen gueuze all the same. 594 charactersemerge077, Mar 17, 2014

Vigorous pop with corkage. Pours a heavily clouded apricot with a respectable white head that falls at a moderate pace to a collar. 
Thick and meaty aromas of grapefruit pith and sour pineapple shaken up by a wild floral, herbal streak contributing big heather and dandelion notes. Hefty blue cheese contingent. Stonking nose.
Beefy green capsicum, brutally tart lemon and grapefruit pith, blue cheese, ground coriander and sage.
Thick, chewy, almost chalky texture with tingly carbonation doing little to mitigate the heft. Finishes with a very earthy tartness.
Aggressive and formidable gueuze. Not for the faint-hearted and very impressive. 715 charactersspicelab, Feb 28, 2014

From a 75cl bottle into a wine glass. 
Bottled 13 April 2002
APPEARANCE: Pours a big, fluffy, white head with good retention. Gamboge orange in color, hazy, with medium levels of carbonation. A ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Funky and acidic with tart lemon citrus notes, green apples, barnyard, hay, as well as some leather on the nose. Very nice. 
TASTE: Funky, moldy, with lots of tart, lemon citrus flavors and sour green apples up front. Lots of smoky leather as well, with a good dose of acidic sourness and tart citrus fruits lingering on the palate. Soft and very well balanced, with lots of funk and slightly acidic sourness. 
PALATE: Lighter body with higher levels of carbonation. Airy and bubbly on the palate, goes down okay and and finishes puckering. It calms and becomes creamier as it sits, turning into a smooth treat after a while. 
OVERALL: This is really fantastic stuff. The feel needs a few minutes to calm a bit, but the overall quality of this aged gueuze is excellent. Well meshed and balanced flavors highlighting both the funky and acidic sourness sides of the style. A real treat and I'm happy to have had the chance to try this first vintage. Thanks again guys! Was another great sour day. 1,361 charactersJeffo, Jan 27, 2014

Score: 95
Bottle is dated 03/05/03. Served in a Drie Fonteinen fountain tumbler and enjoyed on 05/28/14. Thank you Paul for sharing this treat!
Appearance: Pours a murky golden yellow color with a slight brown tinge and a thin layer of head that totally settles. Poor lacing and retention. This looks like your typical 3F Oude Geuze. 4/5
Smell: Musty lemon, cedar/wood, and a light barnyard funk. Residual "brightness" relative to the citrus character is fresher vintage OGV's. Reminisce (perhaps just because of the cedar/wood character) of Blauw, but with less complexity/zing. 4.5/5
Taste: Funkier than the nose, particularly on the finish. Tart lemon bite, must, grain, peach, and a little spice. Faint wood character on the finish. Lasting musty lemon on the finish. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel with a nice gum-dryness to the finish. Nice tart bite with good linger. 4.5/5
Overall: The six year old bottle of 2007 and 2008 OGV that I have previously sampled still reign king among the different vintages of OGV sampled, but this still drank quite nice. Relative to the non-OGV Oude Geuze 2004 recently sampled, this vintage bottle had more zing despite being a year older. The OGV series is a testament to proper storage and the reliability of Armand's personal stash. I most recommend acquiring OGV 2008 or OGV 2007, but the OGV 2003 is also quite recommendable as well.
Cost: $40 for a 750 ml bottle. 1,543 charactersjegross2, Sep 12, 2013

4.8/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Understand that I HAVE to review this at the moment. What I've gone through is too glorious for words. I had the immense opportunity to have the most generous friends possible purchase a 1999 vintage of this at Mikkeller Bar SF tonight for my birthday. What would I do without lovely people in the world? Split 4 ways into wine glasses out of a 750ml bottle.
Just like an old darker red wine, it's impressive what 14 years can do to a oude gueuze. Not nearly as clear or golden-amber tone, this vintage is a solid amber orange that I've never before seen in the style, no doubt due to the sediment settling and fading away over the long period of time that this has gone through. There's an amazingly present amount of carbonation on this, leading up to a frothy head about 2 fingers tall that recedes rather quickly, yet provides sparks in its age. Very syrupy looking at this point, but definitely ranging on wine territory. Not too viscous - only very well placed and assembled.
The aroma is fabulous, as I'd expect - notes of white grape must, apricots, light cherries, and peaches, which then meld into a woody, musty flavor that is unbelievably complex yet not grating in any manner. Notes of oak are very strong on this, almost to the point of pungent, but they meld into other woody complex aromas such as cedar and cherry. Lively, but definitely the equivalent of entering an old, stone-filled, woody building, and the finish is definitely more mineral-y than fruity overall. No severe form of lactic or acetic acidic phenolic aroma here - only beautiful, well formed balanced between the dried stone fruits and musty, yet highly aromatic woodiness.
As for the flavor? Holy shit! (Pardon the language for a moment.) This is fantastic - up there with one of the greatest I've ever had. Right at the front of the tongue, you get strong notes of sour white grapes, as well as apricot, and soured cherries. Then, as soon as the fruits fade away, there's a straw, barnyard pungent flavor, that envelops into bright, vivid woody notes of mahogany, cedar, cherry wood, and (obviously) oak. Mind you, this isn't the buttery or spicy oaky notes you'd find in wine - this is one of kind. Imagine walking into a carpentry factory or studio (much like the ones I'd frequent of my uncle during my childhood), or an old home built with various types of wood that have accumulated dust and must over time. This is EXACTLY what this tastes like to me - a blast to the past filled with complex woody flavors and fruitiness, toppled underneath well settled must, funk, and slight tartness. Extremely easy to drink. Dry, yes, but also very juicy and extremely refined with years of aging. The woodiness may seem a bit too one-dimensional at times, but it's so unique that I can't really dock it for anything. This really was an experience unlike any other.
As I found myself sipping on the dregs at the very end, I wondered if I'd ever taste something like this again. I probably won't, but it's wonderful to see what excellent wood and the ever fantastic recipe of 3F's oude gueuzes lead up to after years of aging. Unbelievably rich yet super easy to drink, and filled with aromas that take me across different palates overall, this is supremely fabulous stuff. I will hold this memory as closely to me as possible for the rest of my life. 3,335 charactersmagictacosinus, Aug 29, 2013

A: Cloudy orange with a thin fizz of white head. Leaves some gunk and yeast on the glass. 
N: Green apple, lemon zest, barnyard hay smells, and loads of oak. Lots of funk - reminds me of being in an attic space. There's some lavender and coriander here. Incredibly nice. 
T: A very balanced sournesss. Has a touch of bitterness and there's plenty of cheesy funkiness and yeast. The age has done some wonderful things to this. 
M: Well carbonated with a touch of sharpenss. Lighter body - very quaffable. 
O: One of the best beers I've ever had. Can't wait to see what another 5 years does to this. Get it. 666 charactersSarlacc83, Apr 27, 2013

A: Pours a clear straw-gold color with a spongy white head. Lacing is all over the place.
S: Pretty intense aroma. Citrus rind, muskiness, soft cheese, overripe raspberry, clean lactic acidity, a bit of wheat and malt sweetness underneath.
T: Moderately strong acidity comes through first, followed by faint oak and mineral, lemon, subtle vanilla, some gamey hay. The taste is cleaner than the aroma.
M: Light-bodied, very light carbonation, soft feel.
O: Although this isn't the best geuze from Armand, it certainly has an intensity (especially in the aroma) that not many other blends can match. Very nice. 684 charactersEtan, Mar 17, 2013

I am a big fan of the series, and have had oude gueze and golden blend, so we shall see what is what with it.
appearance is pretty standard, nice orange hazy color, tints of yellow floating around
smell- gosh darnit, armand has done it again ! huge funk, cheese notes and serious gueze/lambic sourness, i'm getting some light citrus acidity and vinegary type of smell. way more pungent than golden blend and regular put together
taste- does not disappoint, extremely sour, mouth feel about as full as I have ever experienced, typical belgian gueze sour notes but to the max, awesome front of the tongue singe and the sour notes ride a gnarly wave across your palate and stick around after the finish for quite some time. impressively coats the mouth with an awesome sour funk flavor 
although i certainly lack the vocabulary to better describe this, one this is for certain, this is an amazing gueze. WAYYY better than regular and golden blend, and a close second for me personally ( isabelle proximus barely holding on to the number one slot).
its mean, its a vintage and it should be obtained at all costs. Hide your mothers and daughters when this bad boy comes to town, get ready to ride the sour express. 1,292 charactersjsm1289, Mar 10, 2013

Pours a slightly hazy gold with a nice white head. Smell is oaky and peppery with a little bit of funk. Flavor is nice, but not as complex as expecting, especially right after the Armand'4s. It's extremely drinkable and refreshing with a nice amount of citrus, oak and black pepper, but isn't all that sour or funky. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and super dry. Overall this is a nice gueuze but not really any more impressive than the regular 3F gueuze. 475 charactersstarrdogg, Dec 30, 2012

Bottled 3/5/03.
Pours a murky orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with malt, yeast, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with quite an earthy flavor and an acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great aromas and flavors. 543 charactersUCLABrewN84, Dec 23, 2012

A- Pours a clear bright gold color, topped with a two-inch fizzy white head, it recedes to about a finger thick and then hangs around really nicely, leaves lots of lacing.
S- Awesome aroma, lot of earthy funk, notes of mushroom and wet wood. Leather oak and vanilla are also noticable. Nice amount of tartness with lemon and fruit. The aroma is really nice and has some of the best earthy funk character that I've had in a while.
T- Very bracing acidity with lemon and sour apple, complex barnyard funk, very earthy with lots of wet wood and hints of chalk, leather, vanilla and oak. Has a bit of fruity and malty sweetness towards the finish.
M- Light-bodied, smooth crisp feel, smooth feel with a dry, tannic finish.
O- A delicious gueuze, the flavors are complex and well-blended. This is a phenomenal beer and another testament to Armand's masterful skill, this beer only falls short of Armand'4 in terms of the best gueuzes I've ever had. 1,018 charactersWillCarrera, Nov 01, 2012

A-Pours a murky orangish brown in color with a half fingers worth of tight white head. 
S-The nose is straight dirty funk. There is lemon, dirt, manure, wet dog, horse blanket, and must. 
T-The flavor mirrors the nose, there is a bunch of lemon rind and must.
M-Light mouthfeel, almost a little watery, light carbonation, gentle acidity, and a long finish. 
O-Had this side by side with Armand & Tommy and I thought it blew Armand & Tommy out of the water. The funk has taken a nice, big hold of this and isn’t letting go. Armand is a magician. One of the best gueuzes I've had to date, trailing only Loerik and Blauw in my opinion. I will actively be seeking more bottles of this. 936 charactersTnudish, Oct 08, 2012

Tasted both alongside the 3F "vintage special edition" with the red artwork bottled on the exact same day in 2002! Had three blind samples. One was doubled up. I was able to pair the two that were from the same bottle together. These were more watery and slightly less sour and complex (ended up being the gold foil, yellow label, normal "vintage" label shown here). The yellow label has more carbonation, white pepper, citrus fruits. The nose has amazing moldy white grapefruit and citrus rind. Mouthwatering palate.
750mL 2002 Red Label thanks to OldStyleCubFan and later from MrChopin. The red label alongside the yellow label is slightly better albeit very subtly since they are the same batch but the red label stayed in Armand’s storage for two years or something longer. Proper storage has lent the red label a brighter, fuller nose even with softer carbonation. More cedar, spice, pepper, barn. The taste is still white pepper, grapefruit, mouth watering sour with bright citrus and fruity tangerine. Still excellent and slightly better than the Yellow Label. 1/11/2011 8/4/8/5/16=4.1
750mL 2002 Yellow Label thanks to BrainLayer at Sour Epic Part 2. We had this next to some of the best sours in the world and this one I enjoyed more than J&J Rose and J&J Blauw back to back. This bottle was just on the ball. Juicy nectarine nose, big Brett C tropical notes. Taste is sharp, juicy, dry and dusty with loads of moldy grapefruit and huge citrus zest. Incredible white pepper, orange peel, grapefruit onslaught. Awesome stuff. Probably the best 3F beer I’ve had besides past tastings of J&J Rose. Hot damn. 12/11/2011 9/4/9/5/18=4.5
750mL 2002 yellow label thanks to BrainLayer. Okay. Let’s crack this bad boy once again. Is it really the best beer of all time? Cork pops off with aggression. Pours is hazy, deep orange with beige mousse. Thicker. Quickly settling. Nose is perfect. Mild celery seed gets demolished by overripe peach and red grapfruit which yield to overwhelming fresh birch and cedar with hay and horsey dry funk. Cobwebby old character is juxtaposed with fresh and fleshy overripe peach. An insane experience. Taste is ultra quenching white grapefruit peel with sharper wood shavings. So much old dried citrus peel plays with wood and hay. Palate is perfection. Effervescent and juicy with briny saltwater demanding this be drunk in large, quenching gulps. It’s disappears so quickly from the glass. What can you say? Is the best beer that which demands a slow savor, or that which demands its consumption with boundless temptation and seduction? This is probably the best beer ever made. Like the big brother to Beatification which passed on its power but will never yield the throne. 1/22/2012 10/4/9/5/19=4.7 2,819 characterstarheels86, Oct 02, 2012

Appearance - Deep orange with a small head. Clings nicely. Maybe it's just this bottle, but it lacks a bit of the impressive stature of regular Oude Geuze.
Smell - Awesome peppery funk. Heavy hay. Tang citrus that hints towards its sourness. Pepper above all. I love the way 3F gueuzes smell.
Taste - Citrus is more prominent. Orange. Wheat graininess. Pepper in the finish with less funk and a touch of oak.
Mouthfeel - Medium body. A bit heavy for the style and lowish carbonation. Not as effervescent as I'd like.
Overall - I don't know if this is better than regular Oude Geuze. I guess I'd need to try them side by side. Armand blends the best gueuzes and this is no exception. Phenomenal. 777 charactersAlieniloquium, Sep 15, 2012

Taste is quite tart with some fruity notes, hints of peach and some dry earthy notes. Sourness is quite soft and smooth compared to a fresh bottle. Finish is smooth and dry with a lot of tart fruity notes. Well balanced, well aged geuze. Soft and not as aggressive as a fresh bottle, still extremely tasty. 509 characterstiong, Aug 29, 2012

Another brew that has long evaded me to try at a tasting! 2007 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger subtle off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, sour, tart, fruit, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, sour, tart, and citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. A beer that I have been wanting to try for quite some time that has been at MANY tastings, but never gotten opened. It finally happened! I am a huge fan of the regular version, but this one takes it to a new level with a more citrus and lemon rine aspect going on than the regular. It was quite drinkable and extremely enjoyable. While being very sour and tart it didn’t make me feel like my teeth were melting which was a nice welcomed change. Definitely worth seeking out and I would love to see how this one ages over the years in a proper cellar. 1,154 charactersthagr81us, Jul 03, 2012

Lots of funk in the aroma. A lot of wet hay, citrus and apples with a bit of spice too.
Really deep layer of funk in the flavor as well. Very musty, sweaty gym sock funk. Also some pear, light citrus with a subtle spice.
Excellent creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation levels.
Obviously with 3F on the label, it's going to be good, but it's not one of the best in style I've ever had. Will still have again 542 charactersjmarsh123, Jun 17, 2012
4.13/5  rDev -8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip. This is my official "end of first year of med school celebrating beer." 2007 vintage, bottled 12/27/2007 and given a 10 year lifespan. 
5.0 A: Mildly hazed light orange color. Three fingers of frothy white head. Retention is very good and thick, glass covering lacing is left behind.
4.5 S: Really nice nose on this as well. The funk is amazing. This might be the most powerful and complex funk I've ever encountered. Tons of hay and horse. Decaying fruit, stinky sweaty feet, apple orchard, dry rotted sweat socks, old wood. Like most other 3F gueuzes, this is insanely complex with the funk, but not all that sour. Nearly no acetic acid and only mild amounts of lactic acid. Borderline 5.0.
4.0 T: Taste is good, but it's not as complex or as overall good as the nose. There's more sourness, but it's a strange dry sourness, which is something I've never experienced before. Other than that, the funk is still crazy strong, but not quite as complex. Lots of hay, dry earthy woodiness, dry rotted sweat socks, musty basement. Lightly horsey. Mild lemony fruitiness.
3.5 M: Lighter body. Good spritzy gueuzy carbonation. Could use more creaminess though.
4.0 D: This is good and I appreciate the funk, but it's a tad bit disappointing, especially given how impressive the nose is. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great gueuze, but I expect a lot from 3F when it comes to them. 1,403 charactersDavoleBomb, Jun 10, 2012

Incredible aroma: sour, funky, tart, acidic, citrusy. Each freely billowed up from the glass to massage my nasal cavities. Taste balances everything well with a crisp, clean citrusy finish. Tons of depth that I'd never really experienced in a gueuze before.
I enjoyed this more than any of the Armand'4 bottles we opened immediately prior. This one aged quite well; wish we had another bottle. 477 charactersbrystmar, Jun 02, 2012

Balanced and delicate. Tamed by age, but even at what... 10 years?... this blend was still fantastic. It was more funk than acid, which was a bit surprising, but welcome. There was a lovely citrus sour & sweet combination going on in the middle, and the funk up front led to a clean finish. Definitely not as cloying as "fresh" Oude Geuze from Drie Fonteinen. 
Probably not the most complex brew of the day, but its balance rivaled Lou Pepe Gueuze, and promised good things from aging this style of beer. Happy to try it, thanks again! 631 charactersafksports, May 30, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was a 2005 bottle that I had at Brugs Beertje. Poured into a goblet.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden amber color with a half finger of white carbonation that fades to a ring around the edge of the pour.
Smell: There is a strong tartness full of citrus and funk. The funk reminds me of the chalk caves from when we went champagne tasting. I'm getting a mild vinegar note as well.
Taste: This beer is quite sour. The mineral funk shows up along with the lemon juice sourness. The finish is sour along with an aged hop bitterness. While this beer is quite sour, there isn't a lot of bite, I assume that is due to the age.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with fluffy carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: Not too biting, which was nice. I thought this was a fantastic gueuze. I haven't had this new, but the age seems to have done it well. 839 charactersoline73, May 13, 2012

I don't usually re-review beers, but the 2003 vintage is absolutely amazing. Give this beer some age and you will not be disappointed.
A: Cork burst forth with happiness. Murky straw. 1+ (frothy white) fingernail head on gentle pour.
S: Barnyard funk, lemon rind, hay, cheese. So inviting and tasting. Nice!
T: Pronounced sour, funk, and earthiness. Loads of grapefruit and lemon zest with green apple.
M: Light bodied with soft carbonation. 
O: Absolutely fantastic! Hands down, one of the best gueuzes I have enjoyed to-date (Blauw is slightly above). So balanced, smooth, and refreshing. If you have multiple bottles; forget about a few and drink them with 8-10 years age.

Bottle to tulip
Vintage 2007
Shared with farundrpar during a beautiful prepared dinner by our wives on a recent visit to Amsterdam.
A: Golden hay. 2+ (pure white) fingernail head on medium pour.
S: Lemon zest, hay, must, white pepper. Not as much “funk” as I was expecting or had hoped for, but it still smells quite good!
T: Grapefruit/zesty citrus fruit with green apple. Hint of funk/sour, but not terribly pronounced. Quite nice, but I think it will grow and develop with age.
M: Medium bodied with high carbonation. 
O: Better than good, but not great YET! A very crisp and refreshing beer (especially when paired with a wonderful salmon dinner), but I think this vintage can stand to age for quite some time. I’m thinking the 2007 vintage should be enjoyed no earlier than 2014, but that’s my €0.02.

Hazy marmalade with a half finger off white head. Tons of tiny bubbles dance to the top. The beer gets more and more hazy as the sediment is slowly introduced into the glass.
Horse blanket and citrus. Old cheese and gym socks, with a little bit of grapefruit and lemon zest. Fills the room with it's aroma. 
Opens up with tart citrus zest, then moves quickly into the funk. Horse blanket, hay stacks, moldy cheese and gym socks all come together. Awesome, lactic sourness in this blend too. Pretty balanced and enjoyable as well.
Medium bodied with a soft, fluffy mouth feel and effervescent carbonation. A tad sticky on the lips, and drying on the palate.
Great balance of funk and citrus. A stellar example of a proper blend of gueuze, in the same ballpark as Lente if you ask me. I hope to encounter this one again, but the price and way it's acquired deters me a bit. 935 charactersauroracrisis, Apr 23, 2012
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle from Belgium. 2007 Vintage. Into a Rodenbach Grand Cru Tulip. 27 Dec 2007 bottling. 
A: A beautiful hazy apricot in color with a dense white head that foams up to about an inch, quickly receding to a cap of foam. Big gobs of lacing are left behind on the edge of the glass. Beautiful beer. 
S: Funky and incredibly sour. I love Armand's blends, there are just so many notes in the nose. Barnyard funk, strong sour notes, lemons, cherries, and funk, but also there are these crazy notes of creosote, and aromatic heavy crude oil. It sounds like the absolute strangest mix of things, but it smells so wonderful that I want to bury my nose in it all night. 
T: Follows the nose quite nicely, huge sour note with a ton of funk. Strong notes of lemons, but there are also some notes of peaches and apricots in here, quite fruity actually. Surprisingly enough there is even a touch of sweetness that finds its way into the last lingering seconds before I swallow. Absolutely incredible stuff. 
M: Slightly thick with enough carbonation to break it up. Dry and puckering. Spot on. 
O: Absolutely wonderful, hands down the best Gueuze that I have ever had. I really have nothing else to say about it. Simply perfect. 1,226 characterspokesbeerdude, Apr 14, 2012

A - Pours a clear copper with two fingers of white head. Head has nice retention before fading to a cap.
S - Rich musty aroma that seems to be a 3F signature, with hints of citrus. Also a faint musty cheese aroma. Very nice.
T - Initially tart but not bracingly so. Very earthy, with building bitterness and tartness midway through with a considerable grapefruit bite. Very tasty.
M - Medium mouthfeel that is quite up front and finishes with substantial bitterness that lingers for awhile.
O - Very enjoyable. I'm loving the 3F musty funk. Good tart/bitter character with a nice earthiness as well. After an amazing tasting day at 3F, I can't help but be a bit sad thinking about how difficult it is to find nice lambic/geuze in the U.S. But what a day it was... 850 characterswarnerry, Apr 10, 2012

A - Pours slightly hazy copper orange with a fluffy one finger tall white head leaving small streaks of lace down the glass.
S - Smells of lots of horse blanket funk, damp earth, granny smith apples, lemon, basement must and a good amount of oak. While it possesses quite a bit of funk, it never gets too overpowering.
T - Starts off with a decent sour kick initially quickly being enveloped by the strong barnyard funk, musty earth, fruit and a touch of sweetness. Finish has plenty of oak tannins, combining with a little leftover funk, to leave the pallet dried but craving more.
M - Light body with tart, crisp feel and moderate carbonation. This one has very nice balance, as most drie fonteinen's do, and it was very easy to drink.
O - I have now had nearly all of the gueuze's from drie fonteinen and I can definitely see why people go crazy over them. They are crisp and flavorful while remaining easy to drink. Not my favorite of the bunch but no slouch either. 1,123 charactersorangesol, Mar 28, 2012

Served in a Drie Fonteinen tumbler
Brassy amber in appearance with crimson tinges. The slightly hazed liquid was topped by a tight, creamy, one-finger crown of eggshell colored foam. Over time, the head faded to a clingy ring of lace.
The aroma had tons of funky, musty barnyard character. Lots of wet hay. Grassy and quite lemony. Tart but not too acidic. Some Brett and critters. Fairly oaky. Mild sour cherry notes. Bit of crackery malts. There was also a touch of sweetness, which complimented the tartness quite well. Overall, quite intense and complex, yet still mellow and smooth.
The flavor profile was also rather impressive. A stiff, crackery malt base came through on the front end. Lots of wet hay and damp earth. Very musty and funky. Grassy in the center. Strong lemon rind notes were also apparent. This beer was definitely more bitter than sour. The finish was surprisingly hoppy, with the hops being earthy, pithy and quite bitter. Tons of oak and slightly acidic, vinegar-like notes came through as well. Very tannic and dry on the palate with some lingering wet hay, lemon and grapefruit rind notes. Overall, very complex. I was amazed by how funky and "old" the beer drank initially, yet how how hoppy and bitter it turned on the finish.
The mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth and creamy for the style. Medium-full bodied with a super fine, zippy effervescence.
Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze Vintage is a musty, funky and remarkably complex gueuze. The seven years of aging really seemed to soften any of the rough edges you might find in a younger example of the style. I paired this with some grassy, semi-soft goat cheese and would recommend others to do the same.
On a side note, I had this February 10, 2005 vintage alongside my girlfriend's April 12, 2005 bottle. I found my bottle to be slightly drier up front and much less pithy and bitter on the finish. It also had a much more plush mouthfeel. That said, I definitely preferred my bottle to hers. 2,124 charactersDamian, Mar 10, 2012

A - An amber colored beer that is clear in appearance. There is no foam.
S - I would call this sour funk.
T - Not so sour and fresh in taste, actually it is pretty nice and soft.
M - A soft to medium carbonation and the finish is of course: sour.
O - I am not a sour beer fan. That is way the scores are this low I guess, but this sour I would love to try it again! 539 charactersMar02x, Feb 20, 2012

It looks basically exactly the same as the modern one, actually the vintage has a better head though.
The taste & smell of the new one are both what I would describe as 'sharper', more apple tartness, the vintage has more of a sugary oaky smell profile with some subtle apple tartness.
The mouthfeel on the vintage is amazing, it makes the modern one seem like water. Its got a long lingering tartness. So funky, lots of barrel, just covers the mouth, greatness.
Overall, they are both good beers, glad I got to do a side by side, its not 'radically' different than the modern, so don't expect that, but there is a notable difference. 735 characterslanbewardin, Feb 03, 2012

m - starts off with a burst of mouth puckering and then a blast of prickly fizziness finishing with a grassy dryness.
o - overall, having recently had a "fresher" one from 2010, i can begin to understand the current demand for aged sours. really easy drinker and really a wonderful interesting beer. although i doubt i'll ever dig sours more than RIS, it is a style that i am beginning to enjoy exploring. 967 characterscosmicevan, Jan 15, 2012

Bottled on: 27/12/2007
BB: 27/12/2017
This is the 4th beer in my series of sours. 
Appearance: Beautiful gueuze! Bright golden-orange body (a little darker than other gueuzes I have had recently) topped by a large white head that lasts really well and leaves some patchy lace. Subsequent pours cause the beer to become significantly cloudier and deeper orange in colour. 
Smell: I was expecting a good nose on this one, but damn this smells delicious! Beautiful deep funk and tart, acidic fruit dominate the nose. Notes include: Lemons, tart white grapes, rotten stone fruits, a hint of sweetness, musty basements, old books, oak, sweaty feet, old leather, a touch of ripe cheese, a light rubbery note, very earthy, hay, earthy mushroom, light lactic note, damp and every now and then a meadow like floral note. 
This is certainly the best smelling gueuze I have had to date. 
Taste: The flavour is just as good as the nose lead on, stunning funkiness and refined tartness. Initially tart lemon and apricot, quickly followed by must basement, old wood, cobwebs, sweaty feet, lots of wet hay, oak, sharp cheese, cider vinegar and earthy mushroom 
Mouthfeel: Pretty much bang on for the style - medium body, high level of carbonation. Perfect dry finish and lasting flavour. 
Overall: This is an absolutely stunning gueuze, the best I have had to date! I shudder to think how good the Lente is going to be! 
I will certainly buy a lot more of this in the future. 1,542 charactersThehuntmaster, Jan 13, 2012

A- buttered popcorn, toffee. Light collar, tight, whiteish...off white maybe. Low carb, appropriate.
S- light buttered popcorn. Bits of stale bread. Good tart bite that runs out quickly. Acetic. Apple sour back.
T- great sour Apple, nice citric acid bittering, acetic tartness. dry popcorn and tannic nature. Some oak woodiness lingers well.
M- good light body with full cream finish. Tight crisp carbonation. Great sticky flavors. The tannic bite lingers and extends.the bittering balancing out the initial tartness.

A: Pours a cloudy golden iced-tea color with a quarter inch of bubbly off-white head that faded into a thin film.
S: Light tartness and a decent amount of earthy funk fill my nostrils, but the nose on this one isn’t super potent. I get a bit of sweat as well.
T: The delicate flavors follows the nose. I’m getting a lot more citrus than I expected though. The finish is full of lemon and earthy funk, and the aftertaste has some citrus rind tartness and a touch of biting acid. Not super complex.
M: Bubbly carbonation that is very active on my palate. Mouthfeel is lightly acidic and very dry. 
O: A very drinkable gueuze if there ever was one, I just wish it was a little more potent. 748 charactersscottfrie, Dec 16, 2011

a: burnt hay with a fairly low opacity. white froth forms and settles fairly quick leaving a bit of lacing behind.
S; sugared lemon a bit of solvent and reminds me of a foamy Mad Dog candy.
T: Green apple and anjou pear. Drying, astringent, and tart this is a good one and has just a bit of bitterness in the mix. Subtle earthy funk shows in the finish which lends some complexity to an otherwise clean finish. 
M: carbonic tang
O: I like the flavors quite a bit in the way of sour candy. Not to be savored for a very long time, but worth investigating. 577 charactersflannelman808, Dec 16, 2011

Pours a very hazy light orange color with a whitish head. The nose is really funky - get that diaper flavor. It smells really good. 
The taste is dry, funky and earthy and way more so than it is sour. Light on the palette and goes down quite easy. Not all that tart or vinegary. Really tame for a guezue. Overall, I thought this was a very accessible idea of a guezue and I enjoyed it very much. 454 charactersseeswo, Nov 16, 2011

reviewed from notes
deep apricot color. small head. spotty lacing. looks like a nice gueuze. Huge oak notes. Some funky dank earth character. Light fresh citrusy fruit notes: lime zest, maybe some apricots or pears too.
Just tongue-scrubbingly sour. Very very nice. Really easy drinking despite being so acidic that it forces you to pull your cheeks in on the finish and do that thing where you feel the need to swallow repeatedly-- with a forced effort.
The beer is just delicious. Spectacular gueuze that I hope to acquire some bottles for myself... 610 charactersAleWatcher, Nov 05, 2011

A - Pours a cloudy, medium orange to gold with a two finger cream-colored foamy head. Super retention and light lacing left on the glass. 
S - Light lemon, wheat, and earthy funk. 
T - Tart lemons, sweet wheat, woody, barnyard funk. 
D - Lots of carbonation and light to medium body.

This beer defies traditional reviewing. Yes, classic gueuze aromas of hay and barnyard and lemon and a refreshing tartness, but what I really mean to say is: this beer smells and tastes like heaven. With complete seriousness, I think this is the best beer I have ever tasted. Should you find yourself in the presence of this beer, do not pass it up under any circumstances. 429 characterskscaldef, Oct 08, 2011

cork took some work, left a nice pop. nice burnt golden color. slightly hazy. big creamy puffy and slight fizzy head. amazing retention. lots of life in this. 
oak up front, old musty oak. bits of sharp lemon with an old musty funk. 
soft up front with a very dominant oak flavor. light hints of peach and lemon. lots of old dark earthy funk. a very complex mix of flavor.
light and lively with a nice moderate carbonation a tingle through the gums from the sourness. slight dryness.
this is just amazing, one of the best from drie fonteinen. 560 charactershooliganlife, Oct 06, 2011
4.48/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375 ml. 2005 vintage. Pours a still, clear amber with no head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is majestic. Huge amounts of funk, mushroom, oak, sweaty socks, light lemon, apple, and grapefruit. The taste is tons of funk as well. A decent initial tartness, some oak, light lemon, grapefruit, and sweaty socks with a bretty funk finish. Very smooth for the amount of complex flavors happening. Medium body. Soft, chewy mouthfeel. Close to no carbonation. This beer was simply magnificent. All the complex flavors come together wonderfully. The only thing I could ask for is slightly more carbonation. 604 charactersjethrodium, Sep 26, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375ml corked and caged bottle generously shared by jedwards. 2004 vintage. Pours a translucent golden orange with a quarter inch bright white head. Nose expresses citric acid and cork. Taste is fairly clean - more acidic notes, cork and a slight peppery quality towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation. All and all, an easy drinking and refreshing geuze that's fairly mellow, despite the the age. I definitely would like to pick up a few of these to throw in the cellar. 537 charactersJwale73, Sep 15, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -8.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Vintage 2006 – split with airohead2001. Poured into a snifter
A: Dark gold in color with less head than I expected. Perhaps there’s a ¼ inch off white head that has fairly poor retention and only a faint oily layer after 3 minutes in the glass.
S: The nose is of lemon zest, earthiness and a bit of funk. Not as well integrated as others as the earthiness (dirt/barnyward) is more dominate than lemon/hay notes.
T: Nice balance of sour and fruit flavors. There’s not as much earthiness or funk as in many other geuze’s and/or sours. The main flavors I get are sour apples and strangley a little bit of butter scotch at the finish, mixed with some sour. The sour in this beer is by no means mouth-puckering.
M: A bit under-carbonated, but otherwise great aftertaste and appropriate viscosity.
O: This was a very good beer that suffered slightly from lack of carbonation and a smell that was a bit underwhelming. Still, the taste was wonderful and very balanced. Would gladly have again. 999 charactersglazeman, Aug 22, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance is a lovely apple cider-like orange with no head. No bubbles. Smell is perfect - best smelling sour I've ever had. Smells like horse fart, hay, and wet golden retriever. Unbelievable. Taste is also great - bitter and harsh lemons that are so strong that I think my soft palate is swelling. It's thin, light, and refreshing. 
Huge thanks to TOG (the original glazeman) for far and away the best sour I've ever had. This 2006 gem was everything and more that I could have ever expected. 496 charactersairohead2001, Aug 22, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Vintage 2002. Aroma: Dank funkyness, sharp funk some cheese and citrus layers. This is going to be sharp and sour! Appearance: Dark gold and long lasting white foam. Flavors: Actually, it is not that sour. It is a very balanced rounded citrus sourness. Also, earthy notes and wood brings a nice complexity. Palate: Relatively high carbonation and full bodied. Could have been more dry. Overall: This beer was top shape and very good. Tried the 2007 vintage directly after which I liked a lot. Much sharper, a little more straightforward but equally good. 554 charactersLuk13, Aug 07, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52007 vintage. Poured from a 750 mL caged and corked bottle into a tulip. Thanks goodstrongbeer for bringing this out!
Appearance: This pours a cloudy tangerine color with a golden border and a champagne color right at the edge of the glass. A small creamy white head forms initially.
Smell: This is a tightly wound aroma of fruit and sour notes. Nice horse blanket funkiness. Tart apples, sour white grapes, and a little woodiness as well.
Taste: Up front the flavor is quite tart, with tangerine pushing its way to my palate's forefront. An aggressive barnyard flavor comes through. 
Mouthfeel: This is very smooth, sour, acidic, and dry. A refreshing carbonation keeps this feeling light.
Overall: Funky, very complex, and quite enjoyable. As my lambic experience grows, this is definitely one I would like to revisit in order to appreciate more of the complexity that I may have missed. Nonetheless a fantastic beer. 924 charactersKickInTheChalice, Aug 01, 2011

A: CLear, bright orange body under an inch of fine, frothy tan foam. Light, spotty lace. Lovely.
S: Very, very fresh, bright, adventurous aroma of citric acidity along with big floral notes. Underneath lies plenty of equally bright funk - barnyard, sharp cheese, and plenty of grass. Fantastic.
T: Sourness dominates, with zesty fruitiness, sweet-tart candy, and some cheesy, grassy, and earthy funk. The tartness is consistent throughout, and always refreshing. Amazing.
M: Smooth medium body with moderate, lively carbonation. Perfect.
O: I continue to be blown away by Armand's Geuzes. I hope I'm rich someday so I can have a cellar full of them - of course, I got this bottle at the brewery for something like 7 euro, so for once a world-class Lambic didn't cost an arm and a leg. I would drink this daily if I could (unless I had an equally unlimited supply of Armand'4 Lente, that is). I can't wait to try more vintages of this fantastic beer.

Bottle to Flute
330ML Red Label 2004
App- A soft yellowish orange with a one finger head even for a soft and small pour. Little bit of bubbles and lace.
Smell- After having more of the style I have come to appreciate it a whole hell of a lot more. Funky, musty, damp and yeasty.
Taste- This bottle was like gold in a glass. It was a bit dry, a bit tart, a bit funk but all good. Balanced between damp and sour and tingly.
Mouth- Still high carbed after all these years and a bit medium bodied.
Drink- I couldve drank a whole lot more. I can't imagine what trade value is for an 04, but I sure as shit want to find out. 642 charactersFosterJM, Jul 25, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The culmination of my visit to Moeder Lambic in Brussels was a 750ml bottle of this gorgeous gueuze. Costing a whopping, but understandable €35, this 9-year old vintage was served with appropriate pomp and ceremony in a classic Belgian Gueuze basket. Lot number on the bottle said 13/04/2002.
Pours a deep golden colour, orange hued in places, with a frothy head of escaping bubbles. Lace sticks statically around the glass, but is otherwise rather still. The extra depth and darkness to the colour I put down to age. It looks good.
Nose is, oh god, just phenomenal. So classic, but melded and blended. That classic rubbery gueuze funk, along with tart fruit, apple skin, latex, vanilla, oak, and even a sweeter berry-like aroma. Aged characters like wine cork come through as well. There's so much too this, and it's immensely complex, but it's all so well integrated. You just don't get a better gueuze nose.
Taste is similar. All classic flavours of course, but all with a common purpose. Sharp fruit, grapeskin, wood, sawdust, oak, tannins. All these characters and more stay and dance on the palate leaving it complex, but long. It doesn't use the full breadth of the palate, but it must explore just about every element of the "gueuze" palate.
And age? What age? Apart from the integration and the mellowness of the characters' combination, this is as clean and crisp as ever. I can see this easily lasting another 10 years.
(But it's great now, too...) 1,466 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 18, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52006 vintage 750ml bottle shared with eagles22. This had a synthetic cork that took a bit of effort to remove and didnt have any hiss or pop behind it. Poured into a cervoise, this brew appears a caramel looking orange. Pretty much still looking except for a few large bubbles that were created during the pour. There is orange clarity and light yellow coloration around the sides when held to the light.
The smell is strikingly sweet with vanilla barrel aged inclusion and caramel malt. A little cheese and funk across the back that grows as it warms with some lemony lactic notes. Very sweet overall with barrel aged properties being right in the open instead of subtle like previous samples.
The taste is sharp and tangy with cheese, funk, sour lemony lactic notes a bit rindy with a hugely salivating factor to it. Sweet caramel backing is lightly toasted with a touch of smoke. Huge barrel aged presence with vanilla and funk intermingled. I cannot get over how much residual sugar and caramel malt/vanilla inclusion there is in this gueze.
This is a medium bodied brew. Not still but boasts a very light level of carbonation. This experience certainly differs from my previous samples. I cant say it was bad but certainly interesting. I think it might be time to finally bust out some of the older bottles I have been hanging on to. 1,341 charactersstakem, Jul 17, 2011

Smell: Strong funk, horse blanked, earth, oak, wood, fresh grass, and citrus. 
Taste:Wow, this one is so smooth! Oak, earth, smooth sourness (strong sourness, but smooth), grass, citrus and wood. Tart and dry finish. Fantastic.

A - Pours a lovely dark sorta orange colour. Very cloudy with the sediment in there. Good carbonation. A nice 2 finger soapy and creamy head at the same time. Solid one finger head retains with nice staggered rings of lacing.
S - I can smell the strength of it from fairly far away. Funk and wood are there. Citrus and lemon candies. Grape skins.
T - Quite tart, lemon cady, oak/wood, funk. Grass and spiderwebs? It just aches of old creaky barnyards. Grape, lemon, and unripened plums come out. Lovely. Just sweet enough keep from being overpoweringly tart.
M - Strong carbonation and a medium-ish body with a crisp and slightly tart finish.
O/D - Good Gueuze. I can't really tell what the extra age has done but the base Gueuze is great stuff as well. Glad I got to try this rarity, it was worth it. 969 charactersbylerteck, Jul 03, 2011

I've heard a couple people say this vintage is no good, don't believe them. Hazy orange like a gueuze would. Smells like citrus, hay, barn, phenols. Tastes pretty great, sour citrus with abut of plastic at the end but damn was this easy to knock back! Overall I lived it and wish I had more. It's really too bad gueuze isn't priced more like IPA because I would hawg it down. 426 charactersArrogantB, Jul 02, 2011
3.91/5  rDev -13.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42007 St. Valentin Vintage. Poured from a corked and caged bottle into a Cantillon tulip. Shared with schen9303. Reviewed from notes. 
A: Standard pour yields a 2 finger fluffy, foamy white head with awesome retention. Beer is a deep, clear apricot. Lacing is patchy and spotty with great cling. Te only thing keeping this from a "5" is the overall sparse lace. 
S: Nose is prominent Brett, wet hay and rotting wood. Sweet apricot and a sharp lemon tartness round out the experience. Aromatic with moderate funk. Nice. 
T: Opens lemon, overripe peaches, Brett, a sharp tartness and band-aid and cobwebs. Persistant sour from beginning to end. Wet wood and straw. End is tart lemon rind. Finish is strong crisp sourness with a Brett and tart aftertaste. Pretty one dimensional but that one dimension is done very well. 
M: Light to medium bodied, with moderate carbonation. Dry and puckering in the mouth. Dry and tart going down. Finish is sharp with a filmy aftertaste. This one is really bone dry. Very quenching. 
O: As is, the Vintage Oude Gueuze is a very solid representation of the style. However, its brother Armand Oude Gueuze 4 Lente just makes it pale in comparison and the availability is about the same. A solid beer overall but in the end, outclassed by beers made and blended by the same brewer. 1,314 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jun 25, 2011

Pours a cloudy, very dark golden range color golden tangerine/burnt orange hues when held to a light and a one finger frothy white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind.
Funky, earthy aroma with a heavy barnyard/horsey presence that is countered by crisp light fruit and sweet vinegar. Subtle lactic presence. A bunch of earthy oak along with the funky bugs as well as some grassy straw, cobwebs and musty funk. Hints of apple, pear, grape and tangerine. Extremely complex nose that has my mouth watering. I literally smelled this beer for ten minutes before taking the first sip. 
Medium bodied yet fuller than expected with an intensely sour, mouth-puckering flavor that lingers throughout into a sweet, slightly acidic, vinegary tart finish. Very dry and tart up front with only slight acidity in the finish. No solvent or harsh acetic character at all. Extremely funky with lots of earthy oak tannins, bugs and a touch of vinaigrette which is balanced by a slight lactic presence as well as some light fruit. Hints of apple, pear and lemon combined with the vinegar character give this beer a sweet and tart lingering finish that leaves me drooling for another sip. After the initial palate shock this beer proves to be incredibly complex, well balanced and flavorful. 
Overall, I had very high expectations for this beer and they were exceeded. With all of it's complexity it is still incredibly quaffable. I absolutely loved this beer and hope to get another bottle sometime. 1,633 characterscorby112, May 01, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Part of another impromptu tasting last night with my brother in law while we were dying easter eggs. this was served into two tulips and enjoyed about mid way through the evening.
the pour was nicely done with a lightly hazed golden yellow color and a small puff of light head that seemed to come out of no where and settle down with medium lacing.
Aroma was so sour it tickled the nose hairs. deep horse funk, vinegar, sour fruits and a touch of lacto. really nice put together. As i take the first sip the ripe sour and rich apple vinegar dominate everything and leave no room for error subtle is not a word here as it shreds the palate. warming lets you find apricot and other light fruits buried in there and the age really starts to show as it really is just sublimely drinakble.
overall i can really tell why this is so highly praised, it deserves it. a fantastic beer! 878 charactersmikesgroove, Apr 24, 2011

Bottle shared by drabmuh. Thanks Matt!
2006 vintage
A: This beer is a yellowish color, slightly hazy, with a white fizzy head that fades rapidly, leaving no lacing,
S: I would like to quote Paul here: "This beer smells like a nun's crotch" Um...I'll take your word for it. Pleasant notes of funk, hay, wild yeast. Smells very nice.
T: A very tasty example of the style. The beer is sour, but not as much as I expected. It's quite pleasant and drinkable. There is subtle acetic or vinegar-like note in the finish. I would be more tolerant of this if the beer was more tart / sour overall. There are delicate hints of fruit in the nose and flavor that I find quite pleasant. A very piquant offering from a world class brewery.
M: Fairly low carbonation. Very smooth on the palate.
D: Quite drinkable and enjoyable. I'm happy that I had the opportunity to taste it. Recommended. 1,208 charactersHuhzubendah, Apr 22, 2011

4.53/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Dyan for supplying this 2002 bottle to go along with the 2001 De Cam and the Blauw. Consumed side-by-side with the Blauw, and I think this one just beat out the other 3F geuze. What an awesome experience. Beer number 9 of the tasting, and number 3 on day 2.
Pours mostly clear with a slight haze, deep rich amber in color. The head is amply and sticky, providing a smattering of bubbles on the side of my tumbler, but nothing that is easily described. The cork blasted right out of the bottle as soon as we undid the cage, but there was no gush as all. The streamers in the beer look majestic. This is flawless.
The aroma is funky, dry, tannic, full of citrus rinds and a briny character, though not nearly as much so as the 2001 De Cam Oude Lambiek. Light and bright, their is a soily earthiness that makes me feel like I just buried my nose in a compost heap. The flavor is phenomenal as well, as dry and oaky tannins combine with an earthiness that can only be described as dank and musty forest floor combined with mushrbooms, and sour to the point where I can feel it in my enamel. There is not even a touch of acetic sourness. The acidity that wilts my teeth does not translate any farther into the digestive tract, as my esophagus and stomach are unaffected. The finish is full of lemon and grapefruit zest with more lactic sourness.
The overall feel is a bone dry sensation. Sprity but not overly so, the earthiness, funk, and briney salt water sensation make this an absolute standout among geuze offerings. This is absolutely phenomenal. Armand is a true craftsman. 1,588 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Apr 02, 2011
3.97/5  rDev -12.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5750mL, Vintage 2006, from notes on 3/27/11.
Pours a clear strawberry-blond, brilliant for the style. The head is small and wispy.
The nose is pungently funky in a woody, resiny way, along with some earthy and plastic-phenolic notes. Excellent.
Huge tartness is immediately revealed. Borderline harsh sourness is near Cantillon territory. The fruitiness comes mid-palate, with apple, grapefruit and sour cherry notes. Oaky barrel flavor is apparent, and the finish is acidic, dry, and bitter. The mouthfeel has surprisingly low carbonation, so this drinks almost like apple juice. Really, really sour and funky apple juice that is.
I don't know about this one. It was quite the complex sour experience, but I was expecting something smooth and refined with all the age on it. I enjoyed the standard 3 Fonteinen Gueuze more. Worth a try, it might be your thing. 863 charactersdasenebler, Mar 31, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52002-2007 Vertical, split amongst good friends at our engagement part. Bottles provided by Alex, Jason, and myself. 375ml and 750ml bottles for the various years.
I would rank them in the following order: 2003, 2002, 2005 (Feb), 2007, 2005 (Dec), 2004, and 2006 (bad bottle, I think).
*I am going to rate into one but not going to include the 2006, because it was so damn bad, and would really hurt the overall score.
A - All pour a very similar mirky/hazy golden yellow, fizzy white head, some spotty lacing, bubbles here and there on top. Some had more carbonation then others, but overall, all very similar (and no gushers).
S - Funk, sour/tart notes, lactic notes, lemon peels, barnyard. Most of the vintages were restrained in lip-puckering funk/sour/tart, don't get me wrong, it was there, but not as evident as other 3F sours. I enjoyed this characteristic, truthfully.
T - More sour/tart notes then funk, but a good balance of everything. Nice barnyard, sour funky acidic notes, lemon peel citrus, orange peel, slight touch of oak. Some years were more funky then others, but this is what I tasted overall.
M - Light, crisp, fizzy champagne-esk carbonation, dry finish.
D - It was wonderful to drink 2002-2007 at one time and really makes you appreciate all the various years and maturity/aging. The winner for me was 2003 but it would be near impossible to pick any year (besides 2006) blind. 
Thanks to Jason and Alex for helping make this happen. I really appreciate it and it was a fun part of the celebration (although those non-BA's thought we were crazy...haha). 1,585 charactersSean9689, Feb 28, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Full vertical provided by myself, Jason, and Sean. We even had the Cuvée Valentijn and two different bottlings from 2005. Served in various tasters.
A - Other than the flat 2006, most had voluminous off-white foam that settled to a thick collar, partial cap, and minimal lace. Hazed golden apricot body that got increasingly murky as the bottles emptied. Surprisingly there were no gushers in this collection.
S - Most of the vintages were heavy on musty barn, green funk, some feet, cheese, hay and grass, lemon, stone fruits, and hints of vanilla and oak. Unlike Cantillon, or even the 3F '03 Oude Geuze we sampled side-by-side, these are fairly restrained in acetobacter and sourness. The '02 was incredibly dusty and leathery. A few had a vaguely moldy note.
T - Taste is slightly more sour, with lemons, stone fruits, and a perceptible pale malt and wheat backdrop. There's some tart appleskins, hay, leather, and grass. Only light kiss of malt sweetness and vanilla in the periphery.
M - Spritzy and light in body, but smooth on the palate. Very dry and lightly tannic finish. Clean and refreshing.
D - I think we put down over a gallon of gueze last night. Wish we got this on draft, as it'd be a superb session brew.
Warning - the 2006 vintage was very weird. No carbonation, cloying sweetness, and not at all like the bottle mentioned in drabmuh's review. It's almost as if the yeast and bacteria went dormant. If you have a 2006 with foil overwrap and a synthetic cork, you may want to sit on it for a few more years in the hopes that it develops. The rest of these are superb and can be consumed now.
In order I liked 2002, 2007 (CV), 2005 (February), 2004, 2003, and 2005 (December), and I disliked 2006. The Oude Geuze '03 was a totally different beast, with lots of lactic sourness and less funk, even though it was bottled only a month before the Oude Geuze Vintage '03. Batch variation? Cellar conditions? Who knows?
In any case, a thoroughly enjoyable experiment that is well worth repeating in the future. 2,032 charactersMasterSki, Feb 28, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Vertical drank for Sean and Caroline's engagement party, quite a shame other Chicago Ba's couldn't make it for this one, great times. This is the type of beer that just screams to have separate vintage listings as there was such variation. Instead of reviewing each one, this will more be a guide for those interested in the different vintages.
2002 Vintage 750 ml bottle - one of the top 3 vintages of the night. Awesome aroma that was funky but not harsh, wonderful dusty farmyard notes. The taste was just special because it was biting, dusty, floral and sour, yet it wasn't Cantillon sour in that I could drink this all night long. A vintage worth trying.
2003 Vintage 375 ml bottle - This was pretty decent, in the middle of the variations. Was drank simultaneously with an 03 Drie Oude Gueuze and the Vintage destroyed it. Not even in the same galaxy.
2004 Vintage 375 ml bottle - Nothing really stood out here, still good but towards the bottom.
2005 Vintage 375 ml bottle - Somehow this vintage has two bottle dates, a shocking 10 months apart, February 2005 and December 2005. The older one was much better and was in the top 3.
2006 Vintage 750 ml bottle - Hands down the worst of the bunch, I'm almost positive this had to be a bad bottle. This was totally malty, tons of caramel and dough with hops, was like a gueuze barleywine. Terrible, I would not drink this again.
2007 Vintage 750 ml bottle - Valentines dating. To me this was the best of the bunch, a little more sour and acidic which I like in my gueuze. Very musky, just wonderful overall. I picked this up at Drie, super happy I have one left.
Thanks to Alex and Sean for contributing to this. 1,666 charactersjrallen34, Feb 27, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Vintage 2004. A really clouded orange beer, an off-white small head, some lacing and some curtains.

4.35/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottled on February 14, 2007. Happy Valentine's Day, Armand. Opened on January 32, 2011. 
A darker, hazier pour than the regular gueuze. Pale copper meets pastel red; a creamy half-finger head leaves thick lacing.
Light acetic acid; in-your-face apricot, lemon, granny smith apple; hay; somewhat floral. I could smell this all night long. The funk develops as time goes on: e.g., cheese rind, damp wood, mushroom.
Tart expressions of citrus and apple, lactic acidity, leathery oak, and a tannic mid-palate. There's some earthy and dried mushroom funk and as this opens I pick up more funky cheese on the finish, which tickles the tongue. The tannins makes me think of cherry pits. There's a floral attribute here reminiscent of dried flowers. 
Very dry and tannic. Lower carbonation. 
An excellent, dirty but refined gueuze. I have to take my time here, which is more self-incrimination than anything else. Off the top of my tongue, I prefer the regular non-vintage version to this, but we'll see how this develops over time. Both are winners. 1,048 charactersVerecund, Feb 01, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52005 vintage from a 37cl bottle. Pours darker than expected, apple cider amber, with a really nice, big, fizzly head. Nose is huge and literally fills the air with green apples, hay, grass, lemon candies. A lot of things going on here. Quite dry, but blossoms with a fermented apple character that's pretty rare in even the funkiest beers. very expressive and refined. Nicely balanced but could even benefit from a bit more age. A little chalky around the edges, maybe the yeast got stirred up. This is a really full bodied gueuze, lively, bursts with an intense fermented apple quality that's really neat and reminds me of Perseguidor 3.
2002 vintage 75cl bottle. Not much detail to add here as it's all old memories. I've had the red label one and the white label one, and honestly I preferred the white label 2002. In fact, that was a freakin amazing bottle in August 2010 and was one of the top 3 beers of the Akkurat / Belgium "lambic tour", even beside some other very heavy hitters.
Another bottle, this time a 2002 white label from a 750ml bottle. Really earthy on the nose, the funk almost expresses itself as mushroom. Of course rife with lemon, orange. Tons of oak on this, so dry, oak is almost too intense. This is extraordinarily bright and pungent, and it's pretty lovely. I need to drink this next to a Blauw. 1,327 charactersJAXSON, Dec 13, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52002 red label with the hand written dates. Thanks Dave!
Pours a slightly cloudy orange with a big foamy white head. The foam eventually reduces to a thin white film. Light patchy lacing. Looks great.
Earthy, floral, orange citrus and oak on the nose, accompanied by a large amount of barnyard funk and wet hay. Vanilla and a hint of lemon zest in the background. This is exceptional. An amazing nose. So much funk and complexity.
Orange citrus, earthy hay and lots of dry brett on the tongue. Grassy with a touch of oak. Orange peel and faint lemon. This is well done, but doesn't quite live up to the nose. I think the brett has become a little too dominant at this point. Earthy malt and funky sourness throughout.
The mouthfeel is clean, dry and crisp with light carbonation. The brett leaves a strong impression on the mouthfeel at this age. Quite dry, but good.
Drinkability is quite good. I love the 3F funk in this bottle and the citrus compliments it well. However, I'm left wondering what a more recent vintage series tastes like. I think if the brett were a little less dominating, then this would be almost perfect. Overall, this is a great offering from 3F and the nose is unreal. Definitely worth seeking out. 1,228 characterssisuspeed, Dec 08, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - A clear orangish gold color, not a ton of head. No cap or ring, and left the sides of the glass clean.
S - Tannic, sour, tart. Nice and funky, but not quite as barnyard as the Blauw. It does somehow smell pretty smooth.
T - This is very good. Smooth, a bit tangy, funky but not too funky. Nice lemon peel that manages to be not too citrus. Drank Blauw right before this, it is not as good, but is not far off.
M - Smooth, finishes very dry, little bit of bite.
D - Pretty easy to do, this is a great beer, would recommend to anone. 539 charactersAgentZero, Dec 05, 2010

2002 with the old red label and a hand written date.
A: Beautiful vibrant dark orange with great clarity and a big frothy white head, great retention.
S: A nice balance of citrus, oak, tannins, and wet leather. Very expressive, yet exhibits excellent balance. Barnyard, hay, some light cheese notes. Really opens up after 20 minutes.
T: Light tartness and low lactic sour notes up front with moderate oak notes and some tannins. Leather, cheese, some citrus notes, and a light acidity. Finish seems to drop off quickly, with just a little lingering oak and tannins.
M: lower high level of carbonation. Dry mouthfeel with tannic notes.
Overall: A nice Gueuze, but lacks the complexity I'd hoped for, especially in the finish. 740 charactersHopHead84, Nov 28, 2010

(A)- Pours a hazy goldenrod color that produced a good white head that dissipated quickly, but settled in on a nice layer for awhile. 
(S)- Very dry with mild must and plenty of lemon peel. Some hay funk and earth, but actually rather clean if that makes sense. 
(T)- Great tart sourness with hay earth funk. Nice fruity tang. Super dry on the finish. Ever so slightly lactic.
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. Clean, crisp and inviting. Sour, but held back a bit. Super dry, but I like.
(D)- A great gueuze for sure. Dry and tart with nice fruit character. Makes me look forward to trying the regular non-vintage aged with a decade or more on it. 777 characterssweemzander, Oct 25, 2010

Poured into a 5 oz. taster glass. Not a proper vessel for reviewing appearance, so my rating for this category is adjusted to create an accurate overall score.
Pours a murky glowing orange color. The aroma is a very balanced blend of sunflower seeds, musty attic, orange peel, and lemon zest.
The flavor is just insanely balanced and easy to drink. Sour up front with lemons, hay, and a strong tannin profile.
The body is medium and is as dry as Mars. And not the spots that might contain water.
Overall this vintage blend is definitely among the top 4 or 5 bottles of 3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze I have drank, which means it is one of the best beers on earth, period. 784 charactersalcstradamus, Oct 25, 2010

Pours a half finger of white head. Color is a cloudy golden orange with a lot of active carbonation.
Aroma: A big amount of funk to this one. Oak and sour fruits. Lemon citrus again, which I find common in the 3F gueuzes. Horseblanket and straw. Some sourness to this one.
Taste: I think I like this one better than Millennium, but it has a light medicinal flavor to it and is a bit drier. A nice dried fruit profile. Apples and pears. Lemon zest and acidity again. It is funky and has a basement musk to it.
Mouthfeel: Fizzy in a good way, sour, and tart. Light to medium bodied with a bit higher amount of carbonation. Ends really dry.
Overall, a really nice beer. Reminded me of Millennium, but it had its differences. It was fizzy and I actually didn't mind it. A very nice beer that shows age, but still is awesome. Very drinkable.

Pours a hazy golden color with a nice white head and a fair amount of lacing on the way down. The nose smacked me right away with a really pungent horse blanket odor; loads of leather and must. A bit of hay and some slightly sour notes come through as well. 
The taste brings on even more funk--it's like the sweat of wet leather that's been in a hay loft for the past four years. Just crazy funky. A bit of oak is present as well. Mouthfeel is nice and light to medium with good carbonation, really bringing the flavors through the full palate. Drinkability is pretty good, although as good as this tasted, I didn't immediately feel like I needed more after I'd finished my pour. 734 charactersThorpe429, Oct 06, 2010

Beer is yellow and mostly clear until the bottom. Its effervescent. White head of medium and small bubbles that doesn't leave much lacing on the glass or hang out very long. Looks good.
"This beer smells like a nun's crotch" - Lunch (he meant it as a good thing)
Aroma is nice and bright with acetic sourness, mild citrus fruit bitterness and some mild lactic notes. There isn't much oak in here, perhaps with age it would get better. I am loving the mild funk on the back end of the aroma though. Its complex, poster child for a great smelling gueuze. 
Beer is light and has a lot of carbon in the mouth. Its tart and sour but leads with the sour palate and the tartness is minimal. The acetic is winning I feel in here with a healthy brettish funk on the back end. There is a strong citric character as well. Its semi-fruity if that makes sense. I love the palate connectivity of this gueuze, I wonder what this would be like in 10 years. Its complex and simple simultaneously and I love this beer. Some were underwhelmed by it but its close to perfect as a gueuze can be IMO. I love this beer. 1,114 charactersdrabmuh, Sep 28, 2010

a - Pours a somewhat transparent golden color with one inch of white head and low carbonation.
s - Smells of sour fruit, spice, tart lemon, grapes, and some oak. Definitely a lot of funk in the smell; I imagine what some people call that wet horse blanket smell.
t - Tastes of sour, sour fruit, mainly lemon and citrus. Also some spice, tart apples, and a woody/oak to it. Again, lots of funk.
m - Light to medium body and low carbonation.
d - A very nice, very funky gueuze. Lots of tart fruit and funk in the smell and taste; if you like that you'll probably love this one. It seemed like a pretty hardcore sour and not my favorite, but definitely one I enjoyed a lot. Would definitely try again.

Edit on 01/24/12: I've had vintages of '06, '07, and '08 at this point, and multiple bottles of some, and this is one of my favorite sours easily available out there. Very much worth seeking out. 994 charactersmdfb79, Sep 27, 2010

A: Bright straw colored body with a large white cap. Spotty lacing after a few minutes of slow destruction of the head.
S: Nice lactic tartness. Bright lemon citric notes. Musty oak and a nice wet horse blanket funk.
T: While the nose was quite inviting, the flavor profile just didn't match up. The flavors were a bit muddled and muted. The beer tartness was soft and the flavors never really popped. Age might of been a factor here.
M: Moderate carbonation. Medium body. Nice dry finish. A bit muddled throughout.
D: A good lambic, but not quite deserving of the special labeling. As noted above, age might of been a factor. Looking forward to opening a 2005 yellow label 375ml soon. 768 characterscallmemickey, Aug 21, 2010
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52002 Vintage (red label), sampled July 2010
Pours with an enormous white head, looks great for being 8 years old, a lightly hazed orange-amber-peach, a bit darker than I expected.
Smell: Perfect, tart and funky, tart and sour apples and grapes, elements of oak, sweat, damp stone, leather, and farmhouse / horse blanket. 
Taste: Nice mild acidity, a perfect complement to the funk. Tart and funky as I said above, sour apples and grape with hints of oak, sweat, damp stone, leather and farmhouse / horse blanket. Also a white wine / sauvignon blanc element. Perhaps the most refined tasting Gueuze I have encountered. The taste is much less funky than the nose.
Mouthfeel: Creamy with a nice prickly mouthfeel; impressive for the age; very dry
Drinkability: Amazing, this is one of the best Gueuzes I have ever tasted. 823 characterscraytonic, Jul 28, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52002 vintage, 750ml bottle with a red label.
Hazy with a sunset-amber hue. High levels of carbonation feed a solid, sustaining head.
This beer reeks of damp wood and dusty basement. Very musty, the richness of the oak enhances the funk and lemon and orange-like acidity.
Oaky, earthy and tannic, a nice firm sourness is expertly balanced by the wood. Highly carbonated, almost champagne-like in mouthfeel, this is complex yet refreshing. Sourness is purely lactic, there's not a trace of vinegar. It finishes with big tannins, hay, earth and lemon rind. This is an outstanding vintage of an already great gueuze.
05 vintage: Citrusy tropical fruit backed by musty funk and oak. Moderately tannic, less so than the 02 and 07 vintages. The tropical fruit character makes this very unique. Might be my favorite of the 3 I've tried.
07 vintage: Strongly tannic with moderate sourness and funk. I was very impressed with this vintage, and it should continue to improve with age. 978 characterslargadeer, Jul 26, 2010

Aroma is a tropical blast of pineapple with some Bretty notes; the balance is definitely toward the fruit.

One of the "cleanest" geuezes I've had. Crisp and refreshing. Quite nice! 416 charactersgyllstromk, Jul 14, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The more gueuzes I drink, the more I learn about structure, balance, nuance and drinkability. A wonderful beer shared generously by my friend Brian. Bottled April 13, 2002, this beer is over 8 years old at this point.
Hazy orange with a dense white head with great retention and lacing. As with almost all 3F gueuzes, carbonation is high, which coincidentally caused the cork to shoot out of the bottle the minute the cage was taken off. And surprisingly enough, the beer did not gush. Bottle conditioning is an art, and some American brewers should pay attention.
The nose is wonderful. One of the best beers I've ever smelled, it reminds me immediately of the 1999 vintage Oude Gueuze. Woody, earthy, tannic and funky with some cheese, this is beautifully balanced. Light lemon peel with some grapefruit. A little mushroom too. As it warms up, the grapefruit bitterness grows. No trace of acetic acid is present. Warmth and swirling bring out barnyard and hay aromas too. Just fantastic.
The palate opens tannic with a mild lemon peel astringency immediately noticeable. Plenty of lemon character, this beer makes me think of biting into the white part of the lemon peel with it's characteristic bitterness. It evolves to a grapefruit bitterness with time. Very very well-balanced. The case can be made for calling this beer out on the basis of the faint oxidation that manifests itself by way of slightly stale malt, that if darker, would be more leather-like. Let my score speak for on which side of the defense I rest my case. The funk isn't as prominent as on the nose, growing as it warms and with addition of the yeast, both of which bring out the wet wood, wet dog and barnyard and hay characteristics in various amounts. Woody and mushroom characters grow with temperature, making this more reminiscent of the J&J Blauw. Grapefruit peel bitterness on the finish, the palate is beautifully balanced. Medium-light in body, this is mildly cheesy and has high carbonation. Fantastic stuff, I could drink this all day.
I alluded to the Blauw in my review, and it's probably no coincidence. The Blauw, which was blended a year after this, incorporated a 4 year old Girardin lambic. This includes a 3 year old Girardin lambic, some of which was probably leftover and aged until blended into the J&J. I have a fantasy of assembling all the rare Drie Fonteinen beers (97,50th, 99, Millenium, 2002 Vintage, and both J&Js) and organize a tasting with Armand leading, talking about his inspiration and aspiration for each blend. Sadly, that will not come to be, but I'm working quite well down that list of rare beers there. Thanks again, Brian!
**Edit 27 July 2012**
I get to revisit the 2007 vintage. The nose is fruity (apricots) floral (rose and jasmine) with oak (vanilla and tannins). An aroma reminiscent of Hallertau hops is present. The palate opens sour, lactic , oaky and very tannic with mild lemon. Very oaky with low vanilla flavor. Drying, hoppy finish, solid stuff. Needs time, maybe?
S/T/M= 4/4/4
**Edit 30 Aug 2012**
I split a bottle of the 2005 vintage with Nathan. IMO, at this time, it the best beer of the bunch. Bright but mellow with fleshy, ripe and sour grapefruit, with a deep, complex funk, moderately earthy and horesey. Ripe and rotten lemons are also present. Exceptional. S/T/M = 5/5/5
**Edit 24 July 2015**
Almost side by side with the regular 2005 Oude Gueuze, this beer shows its magnificence. Bright, sharp, lemon rind, grapefruit, melons, mushroomy funk, earth, hay, barnyard, endlessly funky, deep, woodsy. Brilliant on the palate, clean, funky citrus, light, airy on the palate, lactic, lemon sorbet. Stunning. 5/5/5 3,661 charactersDefenCorps, Jul 03, 2010

Pours a slightly hazy deep amber with a very small head that fades fast. Woah! This nose is crazy, funky tart and very old and musty smelling, like nothing else I've had.
Not for the faint of heart, this is a very hardcore sour. It tastes old and tart and it'll make your face pucker. There's a lot of that barnyard wet blanket funk to it. It's a super slow sipper but totally worth a try. 485 characterskingcrowing, Jun 17, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Chris for sharing this one last Saturday
A: The pour is a cloudy bright copper color with tons of white head and a nice lacing on the glass.
S: Just a ton of wonderful funk hits the nose as soon as the cork is popped. Lots of barnyard, wet hay, and a bit of sweat. There is plenty of green apple and lemon to provide tartness as well.
T: The flavor is just so typical of Drie Fonteinen lambic. Lots of pungent and intense funk flavors followed by a sharp and crisp lactic acidity. A nice green apple tartness and some lemons in there as well.
M: The body is medium with plentiful but not overwhelming carbonation.
D: This is just another exceptional gueuze from Drie Fonteinen. I'm happy to have tried this and would gladly drink this, or any of their other beers, again. 786 characterswomencantsail, Jun 16, 2010

S - Well balanced hay/barnyard/funk along with some lemon citrus and apple. Has a good juicy aroma along with a touch of a tart and acidic aroma. Perfect balance between the aroma, my mouth is watering and it is very enticing.
T - Similar to the nose. Some funk and tartness with just a hint of sour taste. A lot of fruitiness with some apple and lemon being strongest. Hints of other golden and tropical fruit as well as some earthiness. Some hay and mustiness and a touch of lemongrass. Very well balanced sour.
M - Medium body with a healthy amount of carbonation. Fairly smooth with a drying finish and just the very slightest bit of puckering.
D - Well balanced and not overly sour/tart but has a nice balance.
Notes: Bottled 02/10/2005. A wonderful gueuze that is very well balanced with the tart/sour/funky flavor and a juicy fruitiness. Easy to drink and a joy to drink as well. Definitely recommend this. 1,066 charactersFreshHawk, Jun 12, 2010

One was doubled up. This was not nearly as nice as the "special" edition there are definitely some differences between the two. The "vintage" version had a smokey characteristic that kinda threw me for a loop.

750mL thanks to Todd! Blind tasted with 3F "vintage edition" geuze bottled on the exact same day in 2002! Had three samples. One was doubled up. Same day different blend. This version had a nice fruity and dusty characteristic not present in the "vintage" version. Hazy copper pour with light carbonation. Aroma is very nice with hints of leather, horse blanket, white grape and dank basement. Apple, lemon rind, leather, horseblanket, and liggonberries. Dry finish 844 charactersucusty, May 29, 2010

2002 Vintage consumed in May 2010.
A-pours a transparent golden amber color with tons of bubbles, fluffy and bubbly white head with good retention and a spotty lace.
S-the nose has a well balanced funk to sweet ratio. mushrooms and barnyard funk, hints of lemon are faint, notes of white grapes and a touch of oak towards the back
T-this has a good funk to it, notes of mushrooms and barnyard. A nice balance of oak with faint hints of vanilla. Lightly accented lemon, acidity, and cherries in the finish.
M-very smooth with a fuller body and lots of carbonation, prickly on the back of the throat and a very dry finish.
D-very tasty with great balance and complexity. the sweetness works well to offset the funkiness and the oak has just enough of a presence. 893 characterscpetrone84, May 21, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Drank this wonderful beer at the best beer bar in Rome, Ma Che Siete Venuti A Fa. Very pleased to find this beer bar and a big thanks to the owner for bringing this out of the cellar for me. Sir, you are a good man. Served in a traditional wooden basket and poured into two lambic style glasses.
A: Pours a nice hazy yellow with a huge spritzy and fizzy white head. The head is larger than the body upon the initial pour, but this isn't surprising. Very spritzy and zippy looking with a vibrant yellow glow.
S: Very nice. Puckers your nose with lemon and light fruit sourness with an extremely dry oak scent. Very funky and tons of Brett barnyard.
T: Pretty amazing. Right up there with the best Geuze's out there. Extremely bone dry with tart, puckering sourness and a nice lemon and light fruit. Tons of oak as well.
M/D: Very spritzy, zippy and dry. Amazing.
This is one of the best Geuze's I've had. I'm not sure how one could get much better.
Edit: This was the 2002 Red Label. 988 characterstreyrab, May 19, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Brought a bottle back from my trip last year and finally decided the give it a go.
A - pours a hazy almost burnt orange with a full inch of fluffy off white head that recedes to an everlasting sheet with moderate lacing.
S - hay, lemon, apples, band-aids, and all the lovely smells that make a perfect gueuze.
T - the acidity has slacked off and made this perfectly balanced. a glass of funk with a touch of citric/lactic acid that doesn't fatigue the palate at all.
M/D - the carbonation and finish are spot on and have me going back for another sip before I can even sit the beer down. A standard that most gueuze should be held to. 638 charactersxpimptastikx, May 11, 2010

Smell: Moderate urine soaked hay note.
Taste: Same as nose but a little more straight forward.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with good carbonation.

4.8/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottled in 2005.
Is this geuze? It pours the color of the setting sun and smells like a bowl of tropical fruit. Tangerines, grapefruit, nectarines.. this could be an IPA were it not for the acidity.
And there is plenty of that. It's dry and sour, with carbonation that is borderline effervescent. The CO2 is what I don't like about Drie Fonteinen's standard Oude Geuze, but in this case it's just right; more sparkling than spritzy. 
After two 375 ml bottles I can say with confidence that yes, this is geuze alright. 520 charactersalfrantzell, Apr 21, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This rating refers to a special version of the 2002 vintage geuze, the same red label as the 50th anniversary geuze. The bottles were sold recently at the brewery. It is a special blend and not the same beer as the regular vintage geuze from 2002. The bottle looks really wonderful, handwritten date on the backside. Cork pops easily from the bottle. Looks good in the glass, very zippy, huge head. Wonderful complex sourish aroma. Starts woody-sourish, shows lemon notes, not too aggressive. Finish is getting milder, but still intense sourish, a bit woody. Prickly aftertaste, lasts long. Wonderful balanced. Extremely drinkable. I'm flashed! 644 characterskappldav123, Mar 11, 2010

4.77/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 533cl bottle at 't Brugs Beertje, this beer is labeled vintage, unlike their regular Oude Gueuze. Served in a Drie Fonteinen tumbler, the Oude Gueuze Vintage 2005 is a brassy dark gold with a pillowy off-white head that leaves almost no lace. 
Smell is sour, lemongrass, hay, with a hint of sweet baby diaper as it warms. 
Taste is fantastic, a nice tartness but relatively clean, very elegant, with some tropical fruit notes, like a very acidic white wine (sauvignon blanc), just awesome. 
Mouthfeel is dry, acidic, medium-light bodied, well carbonated. 
Drinkability is perhaps the highest of any gueuze I've ever had. Fantastic taste, with a satisfying but not overwhelming acidity, wow. 701 charactersccrida, Oct 23, 2009
3.65/5  rDev -19.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5A - Bottled on 07/03/2002. Pours a clear golden amber with a mixture of bubbles. An inch of frothy white head reduces to a finger's-worth over the course of a minute.
S - Aroma fills the room as soon as the bottle is opened. Barnyard funk, green apple, hay, sour solvents, slight (not unpleasant) mustiness. Really nicely refined.
T - Sour element is immediately present, although it takes some time to grow to its full potency mid-drink. It comes in the guise of under ripe apples, rather than perhaps lemon or vinegar. Finish is very dry and sourness lingers too. I was hoping that the subtlety of the aroma would be retained in the taste, but it just comes off as not very complex.
M - Light-to-medium body with quite a creamy feel, due in part to the soft carbonation.
D - Pretty good, although outclassed by others in the style - certainly is a bit one-dimensional when compared with the better Guezes I've tried. 922 charactershaz77, May 24, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5April 12, 2002 Vintage. Poured from a 750ml Thanks to Jason. Aroma wicks forth with a flicking tongue of spring essence in a cherry orchard. Blossoms all around. Cottony wafts, sugars flaunt and a wheat essence plays with persimmon seeds and Passionfruit juice in a soft balance. Fleeting ginger. Pours that clear even gold, headed with mountains of residing billowy foam, lubricious in its delivery. Bubbly and alive. Flavor arrives in resplendent glory, with gentle tannins, refined sweetness and lots of elegant cotton. Pear juice and lemon oils. Tart, puckering and full of the necessary farm yard. This was tasted side by side with the standard Oude Geuze and this was hands down the winner. This maintains complex acidity and brightness, yet holds such refined softness and gentle, pleasing flavors. The young has cheese, wildness, wood and acid, this restrains those a little bit and yields soft spice, grassy fields and sunlight. Awesome stuff. 952 charactersCharlesDarwin, Aug 07, 2008
4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52002 vintage bottle drank in 2008: Poured a slightly hazy orangey color lambic with a medium white bubbly head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of green apple with some acid and sour notes and some mild barnyard notes. Taste is less acidic then the aroma was suggesting with some sour notes and a barnyard feel which is quite interesting. There was some distinctive green apple notes which are similar to the Girardin gueuze. Full body with some good carbonation but slightly lower then I was expecting. I can't say that I see a huge difference form the regular geueze but IO as impressed nonetheless. 611 charactersPhyl21ca, May 01, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5April 16, 2002 Vintage Bottle, Sampled October 2007
Pours with a lightly hazy, cherry tinged, light amber color (quite dark for a Gueuze / Lambic) and is crowned by an initially two-finger thick, light tan colored head that is a mix of large and tightly beaded froth that leaves some lacing patterns on the sides of the glass as it recedes. Ah yes, the aroma is just want I need; funky, woody, tart and fruity, it smells oh so good. Aromatic notes of cured leather, ripe plastic (in the process of curing), urea, dried mushrooms and a touch of farmhouse cheese are all noticeable. The aromatic tart notes run the gamut from hints of lactic, acetic, definitely citric, with notes of tart apples, sour grapes and even some touches of tart, exotic fruit. Other aromas of rotting wood, cedar, spicy oak, damp cellars made of stone and thick-amply-aged wood structure add more complexity to the aroma.
Soft and almost creamy up front before the acidity kicks in. The acidity is never hard or overbearing though (which I sometimes like and even crave in a Lambic) and in fact melds quite well with a substantial (for a Lambic) texture & body. The acid is most notably lactic in character, but has touches of citric flavors at times. Notes of crab-apple, un-ripe star-fruit, touches of grapefruit (and even more than that at times) and a green, un-ripened, sauvignon blanc grape flavor add to the fruit component of this beer. Despite the supple texture and heft of this beer it seems quite bone dry. The carbonation, though light for a Gueuze, adds a zesty textured touch of froth to each sip. The flavor is not quite as funky as the aroma was, but this is still quite funk driven. Flavors of woody mushrooms, damp leather in the finish, cherry pits, most definitely musty and even a bit moldy at times. Touches of ephemeral vanilla, butter cream flavors (or is that just evoked from the texture), uriatic acid (cat pee to the layman) and wild flower petals add to the subtle backdrop of this beer. Quite tannic at times, almost coating the mouth, though not the teeth like a very tannic green tea, in light astringency.
I could wish for a bit more carbonation here as I like my Gueuzes to be very effervescent, but this is a damn fine example of the art. Very well blended, very well integrated, there is nothing that is dominant here. I do love a good Lambic, Gueuze especially, and I wish that I had the ability to drink more of these on a regular basis. Almost a bit too refined for my tastes; still rustic though and definitely a finely crafted product, but I think I prefer the regular non-vintage, and the 1995 vintage that I had in 2001. 2,641 charactersGueuzedude, Oct 26, 2007
4/5  rDev -11.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Bought this in Brugge, Belgium, September 2006...it is indeed the Oude Geuze Vintage. I could only hold out a full year before popping the cork. 
A huge fluffy head that looks lighter than air sits on top of a coppery gold teaming with bubbles which are almost champagne-like in their hyperactivity. Gobs of sticky lace at first, but that falls away to minimal lacing after a bit.
Aroma reminds of good white wine, vinous and musty, dried fruits and sharp sourness...like the most decadently stinky cheese. You gotta love the funk to enjoy this.
Flavor is sour white grape, moldy cheese, leather, yogurt. Tart and puckery finish, like intensely sour apples and very young white grapes. It completely coats the mouth, and if you can feel your way through the intense puckeriness, you'll find it on the more buttery side, with modern carbonation to keep things alive and kicking. That coating had me spitting off my deck a couple times, to clear my mouth for the next sip...maybe that's not the idea. But it did, and I'm not really a spittin' kind of guy.
A love for stinky stuff (beers, cheeses...socks?) helps. As has been said a zillion times before, this style is an acquired taste, but Drie Fonteinen stuff can be counted on to see you through. Enjoyable and unique...I only wish I would've bought at least one more bottle. 1,330 charactersMetalmonk, Sep 23, 2007
4.52/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This beer will have you cursing in foreign tongues trying to figure out what it was that you actually just put into your mouth. Some Etheopian slang words are entering my head now just thinking about it. Ok, this is gueuze. There's no getting around it, you are either masochitistly into this, or you try to avoid it like the vile stench of the night that it is. I'm a masochist, let's dive in. This pours like a fine sparkling wine, with a fresca like effervescence. Are you allowed to compare beer to Fresca here? YOU CAN'T STOP ME! There's all sorts of crazyness going on in the nose. Sour, spicy, even bitter notes float up, like cherries and tar, but in a good way.Suck on a lemon, stick some tobacco up our nose, and cover your head with a musty old gym bag. Congrats, you just saved $10. The body is equally complex, but strangely different from the nose. Here you'll find lots of grapefruit and sour apple, cherries, and some used bandaids. It goes down slick, almost oily, but still bubbly and light, with a clean refreshing finish. The sourness lingers longest on the palate, but every sip was a mystery, building on the last. So far, this is now my favorite way to punish myself with a gueuze. 1,204 charactersdherling, Aug 05, 2006
4.74/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pale amber (almost dark gold) in colour with mild sparkling wine-like carbonation. Aromas of lemon, wet hay, barnkyard, paint, black pepper, and mild cherry. All sorts of crazy flavors with this one: lactic acid, horse blanket, wet cedar wood, earth, and mozarella cheese at the end. The palate is quite interesting, as it starts out with medium fullness, but dries VERY quickly. Great sourness and complexity... somewhat Cantillon-like, but a bit more woody. Wow! 464 charactersfisherman34, Jul 17, 2006
4.72/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presentation: Managed to snaffle two bottles of this; one was a present from my good friend BA RichLightWeight, but I also managed to buy a further bottle at Quinns in London NW1 (see BeerFly). 37,5cl green glass bottle with dimpled base. Sealed with a thumbed cork which is retained by a black metal cap and cage. All this is wrapped in black foil around the top 3 of the bottles neck. Light yellow colored main label with the generic 3 Fonteinen logo on it. Labeled as Oude Geuze with the word Vintage in white text set against a brown background below. Large date on the side of the label 07 / 03 / 2002. Listed at Alc. 6% Vol.
Appearance: Golden orange, slightly turbid at first but it soon clears to reveal a crystal clean body. Gueuze like frothy head races high with a gentle audible fizz as it settles down. The head has excellent retention, the carbonation is medium in strength but the long term resilience of the conditioning is very high, it pumps out a constant forceful rising set of streamers right until the last drop. Superb presentation, there is nothing wrong with this one.
Nose: Classic Drie Fonteinen nose with a simply orgasmic Gueuze nose. Dry acerbic nose has a soft farmyard heritage but this is punctuated with dry white grape skins and some cold tannin. Earthy tones with damp oak, sharp acetic tangents and a full body in the nostrils. Utterly charming stuff, has a biting nose at first but it also has a mature rounded edge to it. Perfect.
Taste: This Gueuze has a superb balance to it, this is what strikes me right from the off!! Gorgeous astringency pulls at the cheeks as the base lambics add to the experience, this is all lambic here! Soft yet sharp, dry yet wheaty, the beginning complements the finish and entices you to start all over again. High rise dryness in the finish could be too much for some, the sour grapefruit and grape skins add fruit to this anhydric experience and balance it nicely though. I find this characteristic to be a distinctive trademark finish in the older Oude Gueuze of Drie Fonteinen and very attractive. Incredible stuff, all the hard work has been done for the Imbiber, good to go right now but I bet this one will get even better with a few more years under its belt.
Mouthfeel: Bold feel with a big body. The intense carbonation feels like it shot blasts the cheeks, as this tingling rescinds the flavors fill the void, but after the swallow the finish is pure ball-clenching dryness that pulls the cheeks in, but it is not over the top as in some younger examples, this one has a defined mature dryness. Quality stuff.
Drinkability: Im a huge fan of Gueuze so it is no surprise that this small 375ml bottle was drained bone dry in no time. A very refreshing Gueuze it complemented the hot 4th July here in Long Bach with little effort. Lovers of Armand Debelders dry yet grapefruit grape skin filled creations will surely love this one. 
Overall: Superb!! A terrifically balanced and weathered Oude Gueuze that shows why stashing fresh samples away can be such a reward. Guess I will not see this one again, shame, I wish I had picked up more now! Thanks to my good mate BA RichLightWeight for the gift of this, and pointing me towards picking up another.
Highly Recommended. 3,297 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Jul 04, 2006
4.45/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52002 vintage, served cool in a broad-rimmed goblet, on 11/03/2006. I was very happy to bump into this bottle at the Quinn's, Camden Town, just several days after my birthday, as the bottling date and month (07/03/2002) coincides with that of my BD, and this was the last bottle in the fridge--almost like a belated birthday gift for me~~
A: pours a hazy, honeyish golden hue, coming with a big frothy beer head, with ever-lasting foam on top; moderate, constant carbonation.
S: saw-dusty woody, (unknown) spice, lots of lemon peels and cider-like sour yet savoury aroma, added force by raw-ish and musty yeastiness and smoothly sweet wheat-malts... overall the note is only medium-sour, and really is colourful and harmonious for a potentially aggressively tart geuze.
T: an incredibly dry-ish palate of sour-sweet wheats hand in hand with a lime-fruity and barrel-aged cider flavour, magnifies quickly on the palate... the wheat-ness goes deeper while the lime-zestiness is elevated to the upper level of the palate; simultaneously, woodchip-like, slightly rough edge and bitterness as of white grapefruits along with plenty of tannins dominates the mouthfeel; slowly but surely, the palate turns drier and drier, leaving a zesty-tangy and tannic, almost slightly clashing/rusty, mouthfeel deeply attached to the tongue and also b/w the teeth...
M&D: a surprisingly soft body supports the otherwise very dry palate, backed by constantly refreshing fizziness that takes some time to soften on the tongue... The overall flavour profile shows a sourness being well-tamed through four years of ageing. This is the first geuze I've had for more than a year, and I feel really satisfied with the depth and complexity this four-year old geuze has shown. I'm totally convinced that this bottle was reserved at the pub for ME!! 1,825 characterswl0307, May 30, 2006
