I don't know if it's the best beer I have ever had even in its style but it shows what this style should strive to be. The beer pours a reddish brown with a light of white lacing of bubbles. The smell is dark fruits and caramel. The flavor starts with raisins and plums and finishes with a subtle hoppy bitterness. The feel is extremely smooth and creamy with a good amount of carbonation hiding the alcohol until the very end but even then not overpowering. Outstanding! 554 charactersMeyers1023, Jun 01, 2017

Pours an aggressively carbonated acorn brown with a ridiculously tall and poufy head of tan foam. Looks like a root beer float. Retention is excellent and leaves fat wads of lacing sliding down the glass.
Nose of funky, fruity yeast and earthy, toasted grain.
Taste is spot-on with the smell, whole grain toast with fig preserves, cherries, caramel apple and mushroom. Earthy, tannic and funky, but lightly sweet. Finishes nutty, with a little spice and and some subtle, boozy warmth.
Feel is smooth and creamy, no more than medium bodied and lightly carbonated despite appearances. Detectable booziness is moderately low.
Overall, it's enough to make me want to be a monk. 741 characterspapposilenus, May 30, 2017

Poured into small Teku and allowed to warm to 55ish. At $20 for the small bottle, this is the most expensive beer I've ever had.
I would say it lives up to the hype.  Upon first tasting it, I thought it was as good as any Belgian quad I've had.  By the end of the glass, I decided that it was slightly better than any of the others I've had.  Hours later, it seems significantly better than the others.  This is not to say that it is my favorite beer, as strong Belgian ales are not my favorite type, but this starts out very nice and grows on you.
Aroma is not that strong.  On tasting, it has a very strong bitterness which is very well balanced by complex botanical flavors, malt flavors, and yeast flavors.  It is less yeast-forward and more hoppy than other quads I've had. Balance is so good, that it is not really "forward" anything. Head is very nice upon pouring and fades to a nice lacing, for those who care about that sort of thing.  It seems to me that it has more carbonation than others of its type, which may account for some intensification of the experience of drinking it.  Did not notice much sediment in final pour.
There is a lot of depth to this beer, and it challenges the mind to try to appreciate all its components simultaneously.
Definitely world class.  Is it the best beer in the world?  There is an argument here.  Belgian quads are one of the best types of beer, and this is one of the best Belgian quads. 1,563 characterswmartin, May 12, 2017

Very drinkable. I had a Abt 12 on this trip to Europe and the Westy 12 is in my opinion the better Quad. I need a side-by-side with Rochfort 12, but if you believe quads are the best beers then this one may be the best beer in the world not called Cantillon. 4.75
A – Pours an opaque, dark, ruby brown with a one-finger creamy head. 4.5
S - Brown sugar, light on the raisin 4.5
T – Spicy, brown sugar sweetness, not as heavy on the dark fruit as some quads. 5.0

S - fairly muted. St Bern 12 smells fruitier and more potent. What is there is the obvious dark fruits, some cream/vanilla, some alcohol. Not terribly complex.
T - silly sweet initially and finishes dry and bitter. I'm kind of at a loss. It tastes like the status quo of quads. Nothing remarkable and the bitter earthy finish is pretty off putting.
M - heavily, heavily carbonated, fizzy and dry.
O - meh. The hype train strikes again
St.b12 is definitely much better imo. Never like Roch 10 much though so maybe I'm just an outlier. 580 charactersrypkr, Apr 11, 2017

Definitely worth the hype but also definitely not worth waiting in long lines or paying extravagant fees to obtain.

Tastes sweet with candied sugar, raisins, figs, prunes, slight molasses, and just great all around taste. Definitely in the heavier side but easily digestible. A great beer all around.

The key to appreciating the flavor profile in this beer is to drink it warmer.
I started out at a slightly colder temp, but warmer temps brought depth and complexity.
The most complex and balanced Quad I have tasted. Apple, sweet, and pear in the aroma which broadens with warming.
Very malt forward mouth feel. 
The taste gets a bit dwarfed by the sharp bitter finish, but the apple and pear transition well from the taste. What amazes me about this beer is that it totally changes with warming- the flavors become increasingly complex.
It's worth checking out. Perhaps not as full and rich as other Belgian quads, nor over the top, but the increased complexity with warming and balance is a winner. 782 charactersbrureview, Mar 30, 2017

That being said, this is my favorite Quad of all that I've had.  Others who say that this is "the quintessential" quad are right. This hits all the right notes that a quad should, but in a slightly subdued manner.  The yeast is there, but doesn't overwhelm.  The sweetness is also there, but is kept in check.  And the beer is smooth as hell to boot. 490 charactersgibgink, Mar 27, 2017

This beer actually tastes better as it ages....I have had a 2017 and a 2015, and the older the better.  Dark, complex, malty and both spicy and fruity, with a thick milkshake texture.  This is the perfect winter beer, however it is not available for purchase in local stores in Belgium.  You can find it at northern Belgium restaurants for 10-15 euro per Bottle.  I skip the high markups and go directly to the Westvleteren Sint Sixtus Abbey where you can get a case every 6 months for 42 euro (by reservation only) and they register your license, plus you agree NOT to re-sell to a 3rd party...Yes, it is that special! 731 charactersLelo767, Mar 25, 2017

4.24/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Dark opaque maroon with a soft tan blanket that retains a bit thinner throughout.
The smell on this is unbelievably complex. Toasted wheat or pumpernickel bread, with a spice bouquet featuring minimal notes of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg--these spices are only present enough to be a delight, and are not potent at all. Then comes caramelized, softened apples, brown sugar, baked graham cracker crust, amaretto, and pear. Wow!
Taste is toasted bread and roasted nuts, grape, and plum. There is something deep and savory in there, but it's brightened by a hint of spice and fruit, with faint raisin.
Medium to full bodied, with a good amount of carbonation, finishing relatively middle range, leaning semi-dry. 711 charactersSabtos, Mar 03, 2017

Look: very very think sediments in the glass, dark ruby red color.
Aroma: roasted chocolate, figs, dates, bread, Belgian yeast.
Taste: similar to aroma, roasted chocolate, dried figs and dates, excellent Belgian yeast, little carbonation but that may be due to the age, alcohol and carbonation dances on the toung.
I can definitely see the hype around this beer. It is unlike anything I have ever tasted. I love the roasted taste, it truly is the best beer in the world. It's worth the expense and honestly it's cheaper than barrel aged American beer. 614 charactersdro7, Mar 02, 2017

4.31/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25To honor NASA discovering the TRAPPIST-1 star system, I'm finally breaking open the bottle I got at the local shop last year.  I have to say, everything about this beer is a surprise, from the texture to the flavor.  It pours clear dark brown with receding head, no lacing, and clumps of heavy sediment towards the end of the pour.  
Smell is sweet toffee candy, red apples, dark cherries, cola; sweet and interesting.  Taste is where it gets really weird though.  Starts off quite sweet, but gets shockingly bitter and dry by the end.  Burnt toffee and spice dominate the front end, with fairly strong alcoholic roughness and clove-like numbing feeling on the tongue.  This is one that must be sipped slowly or palate fatigue will do you in, and fast.  A strange Dr. Pepper-like medicinality threatens to make this one cloyingly sweet, but then a bitterness sets in and all of a sudden, you're dealing with burnt malts, dry, strong boozy flavors that give the lingering finish more of a sharp, acidic, spicy yeast quality than a sweet, rounder one.  I can't say this is a particularly balanced beer, and nor does it want to be.  It hits hard and strong in each direction it pulls.
The strangest thing about this beer is the carbonation, which, with it's disappearing head, is between soda and champagne, and less like beer.  It certainly brings up those belches!  Overall, I can't say this lives up to the hype of former "best beer ever, anywhere."  It just doesn't quite complement itself well in the flavors it most strongly forces.  That said, every sip was interesting, pleasurable, and I don't regret the slightly exorbitant price I paid to get it locally.  It may not be my favorite, but it's deserving of it's place as a legend. 1,738 charactersjmasher85, Feb 24, 2017

In all regards this is one of the best beers in the world and has well lived up to the hype each time.  I will preface this review by saying that it is based off of memory.  Also, I have given a bottle of this beer to my boss and to my (at that time future) father-in-law, both met with excellent results.  While this beer certainly lives up to its lofty expectations, I I'll be the first to admit that part of the joy with this beer is tracking it down.  The fist time I came across it was in a tiny beer store in Bruges.  These were well aged bottles to say the least (4+ years old).  The mouthfeel and taste of this batch was sublime.  this was by far the smoothest beer I have had at any abv, while still maintaining the look, smell and taste.  The second and third time I had the honor to try this beer were while in Brussels.  Acquired at a well known beer store just off the grand place.  Again the beer was amazing.  While not as aged as the fist, all aspects of his beer were top notch. 1,062 charactersjaunders1, Feb 01, 2017

4.33/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Ok, so I confess to having had a few before I found a bar in Brussels serving this beauty. It is generally a very expensive beer to buy, probably because it is held in such mighty regard, and being a bit on the tight side I had let it slip passed me a few times! Bad Bujon! Call yourself a man of Beer!!
 So the review, well I have to say it is all round a very good brew, but it didn't blow me away, in the same way as a few of the Belgian Christmas Beers do. A rich dark colour, with a caramel head, and a malty fruit bread type of after taste. In all honesty it seems to lack a bit of guts, but none the less it is certainly up there, and requires sampling at your first opportunity. 
Would I spend 16 euro on it again? Not when there are another 2000 Belgian Beers I haven't tried.
Is it the Best Belgian Beer? Very Debatable. 830 charactersThe_Bujon, Jan 25, 2017

4.58/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52012 bottle. Fantastic experience. It pours dark, ruby red with crackling carbonation that fizzles without leaving much of a head. Rich dark fruit and dark cherries paired with old leather and mild pipe tobacco. Prunes, raisins, figs, and aged Belgian yeast ripened blended together with a hint of dusty cobwebs to add depth and character. The mouth feel is light and airy, not what I was expecting from a big quad. The carbonation was vibrant and prickly at points. The mouth feel was not as nice as the flavor for me, but this is outstanding and a must try beer. 564 charactersdanh53, Jan 25, 2017

For me it improved massively with age, developing a nice rummy note 6 months to a year in.

Amazing looking beer.  Taste is raisin, fig, dark bread, plum, red apple skin, and light alcohol.  Multi-layered, malty, medium heavy bodied, and sweet.  Cannot get over the complexity and the smoothness.  One of the best Belgian beers I have had.  A treat to myself.  I will get this again. 400 characterstigg924, Nov 05, 2016

S: brown sugar, dark fruits especially plums, cherries, spices like peppercorn,cardamom and cloves,caramel and chocolate.
T&F: starts of with delicious dark fruits and brown sugar,with the malt caracters in the background. I sense both plums,figues, caramel and a hint of what feels like chocolate.in the middle I get a more sour flavour that reminds more of cherries with different spices,the finish is dry and bitter but in the background I sense very sweet flavour, the aftertaste are one of the longest I encountered. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth in every aspect,and I already in the first sip get a warm feeling in my body. This beer is great balanced in all aspect,and all the flavours I encounter are amazing 
O: this is a amazing beer and it is impressive in every aspect.  Maybe is hyped up to much, I don't know. Is other belgian quads that are close to this.  Anyway it was a pure pleasure to trie this and I enjoyed every drop of it. 1,060 charactersOlaB, Nov 04, 2016

4.98/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Right now, my standard of Belgians, of which all others are measured.  I've had this by itself, and compared it next to St. Bernardus ABT 12 and Rochefort 12.  Comparatively, the Westy 12 has the best balance of flavors, mouth feel/carbonation, and finish.  
Pours deep and dark like a true quad should.  Head is fluffy like whip cream.  
The flavors are bold yet subtle and evenly spread, not one overpowering the other.  Berries, cacao, earthy, subtle on the nose.
The carbonation is delightfully effervescent and energetic...electric in some bottles, which shock the eardrums.  
The finish is relaxing and pleasing, of a mild dark chocolate, the best finish of any Belgian.  I found St. Bernardus ABT to come in at #2 -- flavor profile is slightly more minerally and metallic.  Rochefort 12 was #3 in the lineup -- the chocolate dipped berry boldness is a bit overpowering for my liking, and always has been.  I continue to drink and enjoy it, but it's still my #3. 972 charactersRobSouza, Oct 13, 2016

A unified sensory experience that highlights the incredible nature of brewing.  Walks a line between big and drinkable, sweet and earthy, rich and refreshing.  This is a world-class beer.

Nose and pallate are a ton of crisp plum, raisin, cherry, dark fruits. Definitely dominated by plum, though. Never had a quad with so much plum. Drank side by side one from Belgium, one of the American releases and rotchefort 10. The one not imported (straight from Belgium) was better than the American distributed box one. Both blew rotchefort 10 out of the water. 427 charactersilikebeer03, Sep 24, 2016

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sight: Pours dark brown, almost chocolatey, with a slight reddish hue. Beautuful, thick head, is creamy, off-white and variable in size.
Smell: dark fruits esters with mild pleasant phenols. Dark bread, and something prickly like dr. Pepper. 
Taste: I think cherry cola would not be far off. There's also rum soaked currants, and prunes, and dates. fruity chocolate notes, with bright berries. Rye bread dough. Pepper. Subtle sweetness, decadent, but somehow still feeling off dry. Cookie dough? Omg this is good. The complexity is pretty mind blowing. The finish is absurdly long and unfolds like a symphony of sensations. Literally 20 minutes and still picking up nuances from residuals.
Feel: prickly carbonation is lively on the tongue giving a fine texture that is almost champagne like. body is medium but sturdy and chewy. Downright doughy. So.etimes feels like I'm drinking a cup of Mexican hot chocolate!
Mind: transcendental? Yeah. I think that term applies. To all those that think good beer has to be a hop bomb, take note. Is this the best beer in the world? Hard to say, but it very well could be.
Is this the same as Saint Bernards ABT 12? And how does it compare to Rochester or Westmalle? I did a side by side comparison and can tell you they are most certainly NOT the same. Of the bunch, Saint Bernardus ABT 12 is the most similar to the Westy 12--quite a bit similar, but not at all the same. The Westy is more balanced, drier, with a good deal more subtle complexity and a heftier bready quality. All the others are excellent Belgian quads, but there is a reason they are all being compared to Westy 12, because this is the Belgian beer to which all Belgian beers must be compared. It is the standard to meet and the yard stick against which all others must be judged. 1,794 characterslogicalparadox, Sep 18, 2016

Pours hazy dark copper. A fizzy khaki head forms then fades to wisps on top and leaves faint spots of lace. The smell is of caramel, toffee, booze, raisins and figs.

4.93/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5In 2011, a friend and I decided to sample all of the original Trappists after I managed to procure four (well, three, after one broke in transit) Westy XII's. The beer did not disappoint. Fast forward a few years when I visited Brussels, I found more of this heavenly beer and brought back a few bottles for a friend. I currently have seven sitting in a cool, dry place.
L - very dark, molasses, with thick head which lingers
S - fruity/fig, sugary
T - perfect blend of fruits and sugar, complexity changes as the beer finishes
F - very smooth, not overpowering
This really is one of the best beers I've had—it blends sweetness and acidity/carbonation quite well. Roche10 is often compared with this beer, which is more of a compliment to Roche10 than a knock to Westy XII. Although Roche10 comes very close, Westy XII is still the king of the Trappists; Roche10 seems slightly more carbonated, slightly overpowering the blend of sweetness compared to Westy XII. If you can find Westy XII—especially in Brussels—reward yourself, but I would never pass on a Roche10, especially given the differences in price (Westy XII was €12). 1,138 charactersEsquire08, Sep 02, 2016

A- Opens well and pours a 1" high light brown head that lasts for nearly 4mins before film out. Dark brown colour and unfiltered
S- Molasses, fig, caramel
T- Complex. A lot of flavors as expected from a quad. Sweet. Changes as it lingers on the tongue. Very Roche10 like or should I say the other way around?
M- Creamy going down then dries out
O- Nice beer. Not great and severely overrated. Not worth some $15/20/bottle by a long shot. Will not try again. Better off with Roche10's at $4/ea and you get 90+% of this beer. 
Food Pairing
This rather good quad went well with...... Roasted lamb leg.

Aroma: I let it warm and it  smelled really sweet and boozy, mainly caramel and brown sugar with a slight red wine aroma but besides that, didn't get much dark fruits smell. 
Taste: caramel and toffee, I'd say really sweet and spicy, not fruity at all, maybe a bit of that red wine character.
Mouthfeel: the best of this beer IMO. Despite being so sweet, the mouthfeel was like expansive and spot on, taking that sweetness apart and letting some hoppy flavours develop.
Overall: Well, another praised beer that I think it's very good but not the "holy grail". I prefer Rochefort 10 over this, a lot more -that should get much more praise than this. That one is much fruity and pleasant. This Westvleteren seemed to be one-dimensional and it's 5 times more expensive. 887 charactersjamesroses, Aug 28, 2016

Aromas of rich toffee and date forward, with highlights of molasses, apple, caramel, fig, plum, subtle dark grapes, and earthy overtones. Very rich and layered aromas. Flavors are a richly sweet blend of old world fruit forward, sticky sweet with fig, date, plum, raisins, and followed with notes of apple, caramel, toffee, molasses, and earthy notes, as well as a solid boozy kick, and some subtle earthy notes. Extremely layered and dynamic flavor profiles, rich and earthy throughout, on a chewy, rich body. There is an edge from the carbonation that helps to lighten up this beast of a beer, but only slightly. The aftertaste is a blend of all the rich old world and stone fruits, with a solid booze warmth building. Slow, rich, lingering finish, with notes of molasses, date, and fig loitering on your taste buds. What a tremendous beer! 981 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 09, 2016

4.57/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Found at a bottle shop in Denmark, surprised to stumble upon it. I was really excited just to try it, knowing how difficult it is to find and the reputation around it. It was good, very good. Maybe not the ’best in the world’ (it’s impossible to say with so many great beers out there), but really great to find something so interesting. Good appearance, really large head that adds to the flavour of the first few sips. The toasted caramel flavour is really nice. I bought a few more bottles to age as well, that should be fun. 534 charactersraysat, Aug 07, 2016

4.52/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.54500th review! 330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 4/20/2014. Pours clear deep ruby red/brownish color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Moderate peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible compelxity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly crisp/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with a only a light warmth present after the finish. Overall this is an insane quadrupel style. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. Very similar to Abt 12; but this one had more nutty/biscuity malt complexity and a better mouthfeel. A highly amazing offering all around, as I had hoped for. 1,905 characterssuperspak, Aug 05, 2016

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I love this beer. i drive to the brewery/monastery every chance I get to drink and pick up a few. Unfortunately that's like once a year or two. Last time I was there I was talking with an older gentleman who said he lived close by. As we were talking, a large fly dove into his 12. He calmly took the fly out with a spoon, let it dry on the table, and continued to enjoy the beer --- "Can't let it go to waste."  Even the fly eventually shook itself off and flew away...
This beer is hard to get. You can get it only at the monastery, and even then you have to make reservations ahead of time. But even if you don't have a reservation, go by and have some at the cafe next to the monastery. If you're lucky, you can pick up a gift pack with a few bottles of 12 or sometimes even a six pack in the small shop. 809 charactersFotonut, Jul 11, 2016

Because you guys snap up this quad, I never expected to taste it.
Listed on the "1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die," this was one I never expected to Have. So imagine my surprise in Stockholm when I got lucky in a Belgian bar (Belgobarren) and they served it with chocolate.
Quite possibly the most analyzed ale in the world, I will say just two things.
First, it reminded me a lot of Orval in its medicinal aftertaste (medicine is good for you and, done correctly, "medicinal" is a good taste.)
Second, MJ's "Great Beers of Belgium" devotes 4 pages to Westvleleteren and is a must-read for any devotee to this brewery.  MJ's 1999 "guide" gave this 4 of 4 stars back when 12 was called the "Yellow" .... and, guys, he kept it to one line: "mahogany in color, creamy, gingery and toffeeish." We can learn from that.
As for the price, it was not worth the arm and leg I paid. So, I am one and done looking for 12... but glad that it found me. 991 charactersBeginner2, Jul 08, 2016

Aroma is complex and rich, lots of spices, fruits, malts and alcohol, no hops. Taste is complex too, delicious and strong, lots of alcohol and dark fruits. Bold body with high carbonation. Worldclass beer, you should taste it at least once. Cheers. 325 charactersMike_Aguirre, May 12, 2016
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this beer as part of a Trappist tasting that my friends and I had been putting together for a while.  Obviously, the guy who brought the Westy 12 didn't have to bring anything else.  We started with it, and split a bottle 4 ways, into traditional chalice type glass.  It's a gorgeous dark dark plum-brown, with a nice little head (pouring left something to be desired, but that's on us).  It smells like you'd expect and hope a quad to smell, and the same holds true for taste and feel.  It wasn't too sweet, wasn't too boozy (considering it's over 10%).  I didn't let it sit on my tongue for too long, but it was incredibly smooth drinking.  Will head to Belgium soon to buy some more. 692 charactersdfd02186, May 10, 2016

Would I drink it again? Of course. Will I pay the $60 my LBS wants for a bottle? He'll no. 289 charactersd3brewing, May 10, 2016

4.11/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I'm not a big fan of Trappiste beers I must admit. I love ones with a hint of acidity like Karmeliet, or complex ones like Rochefort 12. So I wasn't expecting that much. After all, the best beer in the world title came from a lot of hype and rarity. 
On the smell, it's shocking how it smells exactly like a doppelbock. Cloves, caramel, banana. Nothing similar to a trappiste. I'm missing the dark fruit notes from a Rochefort for example. On the taste, it's disappointing. It's like an amped up Chimay (so too sweet for me), but it doesn't surprise. My friends who like Trappiste beers absolutely loved it, but the lack of surprise and the sweetness disappointed me. Rochefort manages to stay on a drier note and is complex, interesting. This one is more like a british beer, meaning it's balanced and simple. Because it's rare, online bottleshops sells this 10 € for the 33 cl. But a case is around 40 € at the Abbey, so less than 2 € a beer... It's not more expensive than other trappiste beers (less, even). I think the monks know they do a good beer, but they don't believe it's better than what the other abbeys do. And this is to me absolutely true. 1,163 charactersHallu, May 09, 2016

4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Found in Bruges, drank these with dad in Brussels in Westvleteren glasses.   Pours a rich walnut color with an off-white head- sizable at first and present the whole way down- about half a cm for a while, then lacing.  Smell is mild, yeast, a little sweetness, a little alcohol, a tiny bit of phenolic funk lurking way in the background.  Taste is assertive up front- dark fruit, raisins, wood, deep and complex, boozy warmth.  And although the taste is assertive, as I said, the flavor blends in a perfect way so that it almost has a mellow pleasantness.  Mouthfeel is creamy and full-bodied and highly carbonated- really great.  Overall what is there to say- the beer is flawless and I'm only taking a quarter point off smell because I wish it less subtle.  Amazing. 768 charactersburnstar, May 06, 2016

4.91/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured 330ml bottle into chalice. It is a deep, dark amber brown in color with a thick 2 finger khaki head remains for the entire session and leaves webs of lacing on my glass. The aroma is fantastic with brown sugar, bread, sweet dark fruits with some yeast and toffee and nice spices. Flavor is very full with abundant candied plums, raisins, and figs. Very bready with some brown sugar, toffee. There is a nice yeast and spice on the finish. The body is soft and sublime, medium feel with bubbly carbonation. This is certainly the best Quad I have ever enjoyed! 564 charactersRi0, May 01, 2016

4.69/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75So the day finally came. It's the 24th of April, one day before celebrating the Liberty Day in Portugal. Westvleteren XII is, until this date, my white wale. Since my first days here in BA, Westy 12 has been my first moonshot, my only European moon shot that comes today to an end.
So I used my Russian River keychain to open up this bottle and pour it to a Leffe glass.
A: The body is dark, coppery to brown hues but a bit crystalline. The head is white with some retention on the the smallest possible iteration and has some great lacing.
S: The aroma is composed with belgian yeast, raisins, blueberries and some alcohol due to the 10.20% ABV. If it wasn't for the alcohol, this aroma would be just perfect.
T: The taste is just perfect with the great taste of this belgian yeast, the dark roasted malts, the prominent raisins and the blueberries. But again, alchohol strikes again because it should, indeed, be a bit more hidden in all these flavors.
M: The body is very high, high carbonation that gives this velvety touch to the beer. If you look at the top of the glass, it seems that the yeast is still alive by creating small areas of activity but it's just the beautiful carbonation making its work.
O: The wait is over. And I'm very happy about this. By the end of this beer, I can say that this is not the perfect beer but it's by far the best quad I've had, which is a very subtle and hard style to make. Or probably is just the romantic side of a successful hunt speaking. I'm very happy at the moment and I feel like the spirit of craft beer is blooming inside of me. :) Thank you all you BAs! 1,614 charactersjoaopmgoncalves, Apr 24, 2016

This review is based on a bottle with a more recent date code in 2015.
A: rich mahogany red brown in colour with a consistently thick and productive head sitting about a centimetre (~1/2") and remaining throughout the beer
N: strong earthy tones, complex malts, raisins and other dried fruits
T: beautiful malt structure, complex and well balanced. Notes of raisin, caramel, slight sourness and well disguised ABV. 
M: probably one of the stronger caracteristics of this beer for me. Full, velvety luxuriousness
O: great beer, no doubt. Hard to come by which adds to its cache. I would certainly never turn down the opportunity to try another, especially one that has aged, but it won't be my daily drinker. Lol 764 charactersdabeerbuddha, Apr 22, 2016

Dark brown with an off-white head. Great retention lasting all the way down.
Very complex aroma, dried fruit, brown sugar, slight boozy alcohol too.
Smooth and velvety mouth feel. 
Lovely sweet taste with lots of flavours, sticky sweet fruit cakes, more dried fruit, breads, caramel.
Not as much alcohol in the taste as there was in the aroma.

The one pours a dark leathery-looking brown, with a 1.5 inch head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells like raisins, port wine, rum, caramel, tobacco, yeast phenols, and toffee.
This has a pretty crazy complexity to it, a perfect marriage of malt and yeast. It has a lot of raisin and dark fruit, first and foremost, gives off kind of the impression of port wine, with a spiced character that's reminiscent of rum. There's a bit of bitterness, kind of reminiscent of dark chocolate and tobacco, with some yeasty phenols, brown bread, and clove. There's so much going on in this beer and I can't get over how good it is.
This has a higher level of carbonation, with a pretty creamy mouthfeel.
The top of the mountain, so to speak. The view is pretty nice up here, and this is an absolutely world class beer in every way. A stunner. 916 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 20, 2016

Pours lightly murky brown with a slight, tan foam head that quickly fizzes away into a few filmy bubbles before receding into nothing. The aroma holds all kinds of aged fruits, brown sugar, caramel, dates, figs, raisins, plums, suggestions of oxidation, rich bread, fruit cake. Flavor is big and sweet, lots of syrupy fruits, hints of tang to the dark berries, lots of brown sugar, plums, golden raisins, dates. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Lightly warming finish with lots of sticky sugars, overripe fruits, candied sugars, hefty caramel and dates, lots of sweet bread. Immensely complex and nuanced, and quite drinkable given the ABV. Additionally, the beer has aged gracefully. Absolutely world-class. Wonderful beer. 837 charactersleighton, Mar 18, 2016

A good amount of heat and some hop presence which detract from the smooth, fruity, nuttiness of the beer. If I had this again, I would age it and let it mellow out, but definitely a beer that is worthy of its hype. 286 charactersSheppard, Mar 08, 2016

Excellent in all aspects, including a lively but very soft medium+ body. The flavor and aroma are loaded with dark dried fruits. Spot on bitter/sweet balance. Somewhat surprised that I so clearly preferred this over the Rochefort 10 that it was paired with.  Also think I had a very slightly preference for the 2015 over the 2012 vintage, although both were thoroughly enjoyable. 457 characterschinchill, Mar 06, 2016

Taste : Very drinkable, a little bit sweet and complex flavor in mouth.
Overall : I have to say this beer is really great, pretty much live up to it's hype. But since the high price and rarity, I would enjoy St.bernardus Abt.12 - almost the same beer. 460 charactersnerdboy19, Mar 03, 2016

A: Pours dark brown with a tan colored head, head is pillowy, full, creamy, lots of lacing, good amount of carbonation, no light comes through around the edges, looks solid.
A: Figs, raisins, plums, dark brown sugar, toffee, caramel, lots of aromas in this beer, bread notes, Belgian yeast, hint of alcohol, very complex with lots of depth.
T: Like the nose, there are notes of dark fruits like figs and plums, dark roasted and toasted candy, Belgian yeast,  spice, clove, hint of banana, finish is dry with more dark fruits lingering in the aftertaste, very tasty, drinkable. 
M: Full bodied with lots of carbonation, semi-dry finish, very smooth and creamy.
O: A world class beer, full of flavor, nice mouthfeel, lots of aroma, definitely worth the money I paid to get it. This is an amazing beer, I can't believe how drinkable it is for 10.2 % ABV, I won't hesitate to place another order for this beer. 963 charactersBrolo75, Mar 03, 2016

Appearance: pours a very dark, purplish brown color. Almost ruby-like. Carries a fair amount of yeast trub into the glass with it, even after settling for a while, though not nearly as much as Rochefort 10. Crazy amount of activity going on in the glass, with tons of bubbles rising up the edges and from the center. On top is a massive, stiff bed of foam, that sticks around forever. Literally for like a half hour.
Aroma: lots of stone fruit, and even some dark grape aroma. My first thought upon smelling it was flat grape soda, but upon giving it some more time, all the aromas came through. Spicy Belgian yeast, along with lots of dark, deep fruit notes. Plums mostly, although the dark grape notes are definitely there too. 
Taste: very smooth and sweet, with tons of fruit flavor coming through. It's probably the fruitiest beer I've ever had, in strict terms of potency. If Julius and King Julius deliver the straight up orange juice, this beer is all plum, pomegranate, and grape. Incredibly smooth and refined. A touch of spice and some burnt sugar come through as well as the beer warms a bit.
Feel: LIghtly carbonated, this brew has a silky-smooth feel and coats the palate with flavor. It's not viscous, but carries a very full body nonetheless. None of the 10% ABV is detectable.
Overall: it was a pleasure to drink what many consider one of the best beers in the world. I agree with the assessment delivered by many prior beer drinkers. Even as tastes change, and people flock to hops, stouts, and sours (myself included) this beer will remain one of the best and most sought after brews, and for good reason. It's worth it! 1,717 charactersTheElectricOne, Feb 29, 2016

4.57/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Waited 5 years to try this beer, at one point (specifically when I first joined BA in 2010) this was rated as the #1 beer. The hype around this was immense, coupled with the fact it was nearly impossible to get, even more so as time went on and the abbey began to restrict sales to some notable traders. Finally found some in stock at an online store, so I threw some Cantillons in my cart and hit purchase, a week later here we are!
Poured from the yellow cap adorned, nondescript bottle into my favorite Gandhi glass snifter, it comes out a beautiful ruby brown, dark enough to not see through, but light enough around the edges to show its true colors. A super bubby off-white head pillows up and leaves moderate lacing.
Smell is lovely, a ton of malt and Belgian yeast, spicy, notes of plums. Taste begins with a big chewy bread note, followed by plums, fruits, molasses and rum flavors. Ends with a hint of roasted malt, some bitterness, and a nice yeasty esters.
Body is very bubbly and carbonated, it adds to the spice. Extremely light for the ABV. I think the body is one of the main selling points.
Overall a very nice quad, but I don't see the hype. I had Abt 12 from St. Bernardus a few months ago and I think the similarities are really obvious. This beer might beat it by a bit, but not by any significant measure. Maybe with age the differences are more prominent... 1,384 charactersBranfordBound, Feb 16, 2016

A - Murky, brown, thick, creamy head, poured all of it in my St. Bernardus glass even the yeast, they worked hard and I wanted to appreciate them too.
S - Smells of molasses, raisons, Belgian candi sugar at the homebrew store, caramel, toffee, biscuit malts.
T/M - WOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAHHH. This was my original white whale, I sadly gave up on it but came to work one day to find that my co-worker dropped it off on my desk after learning that I never had it yet. Taste is remarkable. People say fresh is better and I'll believe them once I try it in Belgium but damn, the carbonation was mellow, raisons, alcohol well hidden, dried dark fruits throughout, did not want this one to end.
O - The original and longest lasting #1 beer in the world honestly should still be up there. This beer is what brewing is all about. Exclusivity but not too crazy, spot-on style profile, amazing smells and tastes. If you close your eyes while enjoying it you may just imagine the monks brewing it, I didn't but you may. 1,082 charactersHesscabob, Feb 04, 2016

I am having this before dinner to sharp my senses and pouring this to both the original chalice and in my Orval one. Interestingly, its appearance was much better on Orval’s.
It has a brown reddish color with a thick dark beige head with eternal retention and leaving a curtain of laces. Hard to beat for the style.
Nice aroma with notes of prunes, raisins, plums, raspberries, molasses, dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, grape juice, brandy and candied fruits. This is a bit more delicate than I expected, but elegant and still quite present.
Bold flavor with notes of figs, Port wine, creamy chocolate, noble hops, prunes, some molasses, bread crust, lots of spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, vanilla), peppery yeast, a bit of licorice, wood, a distant blue cheese, herbs, pear, apple puree, banana, mild tobacco, raisins, candi sugar and cherries. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Virtually it is easy to keep going naming more flavors.
Liquorish full body (not heavy) with perfect carbonation of tiny bubbles. Alcohol of 10.2% is subtle and disguised to trick you.
Needless to say this is an excellent beer. Huge fruit and malt complexity with enough hops to balance its sweetness and a phenolic vortex. Sure it is hard to live up to its legend and I am not sure this is really superior to Bernardus 12. Expectation is a bitch; still I cannot name definitely better non-barrel aged Quads (I could name very few equivalents).
Now I know why they don’t expand and let common men to brew this, it would lose its magic imaginative differential. 1,648 charactersFLima, Jan 23, 2016

The head quickly dissipates but leaves some lacing on the glass.  Smell was a mix of dark fruits (dark/sour cherry, raspberry, red grapes) and possibly even some melon or maybe apricot.  There was another acidic, fruity flavor that I couldn't quite place.  The taste was sweet and fruity on the front of the palate and the grape flavor came through more clearly than with the aroma.  There was a touch of bitterness on the finish which helped to balance the beer.  The alcohol was certainly there but it didn't overwhelm the flavors.  It was more carbonated than expected and the feel was on the thin side for a quad.
Suggested Food Pairing: Smoked white cheddar
If you like this beer then you should also try: Trappistes Rochefort 10
Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely have it again) Certainly a good beer, but not one that I would rate as one of the best in the world.  I really expected it to be more flavorful and full-bodied...generally "bolder" than it was.  It seemed a little delicate to me, which isn't necessarily bad it's just not what I was looking for.  In comparing it with other highly regarded Belgian quads I'd put it on par with Bernardus 12 but behind Rochefort 10.  If you can get your hands on one it's worth trying (lots of people seem to think it's pretty fantastic) but it didn't blow me away. 1,415 charactersSHDoyle, Jan 17, 2016

4.66/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Well this is it - the granddaddy of beers: Westvleteren XII. 5 years ago to the day when I joined BeerAdvocate this was the number 1 beer in the world, since then it has been overtaken by barrel-aged beers (and a whole lot of hyperbole) but this is the one I have always wanted. Now that I have it warming up to 12 Celsius on my kitchen bench I find myself reflecting back over the last 5 years and 649 beer reviews: I’ve had a great time, it has been a real pleasure to taste so many fantastic brews and I’ve quite enjoyed writing every one of the 240,000+ words on the subject, as I hope many have enjoyed reading them. Well it’s time now to see what the monks of Sint-Sixtus can do.
Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Chimay chalice.
A: Presents with a cloudy caramel brown and nice dense 2 centimetre off-white head that slowly tapers back to a still dense half centimetre blanket on top. I’ve always loved the look of a decent Quad and this one is no exception - top marks. 10/10.
S: Sweet dark fruits (plum, prune, date) with a splash of brandy and some nice bready yeast tones. It’s not quite as complex as expected, but it is nonetheless a moreish Quad aroma. 8/10.
T: Sublime flavour profile - begins with the above noted dark fruits, touch of brandy, some mid palate bread and burnt sugar notes follow through to a hint of cracked pepper and an apothecary of herb characters - it’s difficult to pick an individual herb but if I had to I would say wormwood. This is a flavour profile that commands respect (although so does the MUCH cheaper St. Bernardus Abt 12). 10/10.
M: Medium to heavy bodied with a mid to light, dense carbonation. A touch of stickiness means you get a nice Quad sheen coating your tastebuds. 10/10.
D: Was it as good as I was expecting? No. Still it is one of the greatest Quadrupels I’ve managed to lay my hands on, and I’ve had a few Quadrupels now. Compared to its brethren St. Bernardus Abt 12 and Trappistes Rochefort 10 though it’s not worth the price or trouble you go through accruing it, and I suspect if it was a bit more available that it might not be so hyped, but there you go it is and St. Bernardus Abt 12 is my Quad of choice overall. As Westy XII warmed up even more a wild cherry note became present, how complex can a beer get? This guy. 9/10.
Food match: Obvious choice is cheese made by the sisters of Abbaye de Belval which uses Westvleteren beer to refine it, and other Trappist cheeses would work well. 2,482 charactersdoktorhops, Jan 13, 2016

 Looked like a typical quad with a medium to dark color with exceptional head retention for the age
 Smelled like raisins,stone fruit and caramel
 The complexity from the very start of the first sip was worth everything it took to get a bottle! 
  At first its caramel soaked raisins that giveaway to bready stone fruit and belgian yeast esters!

Before I get on, I will say that, I am cellaring a few bottles to try a year from now and 2 years from now. Had a 6 pack shipped in and just poured myself a nice chalice. Our came 2 fingers of foam. Nice dark brown body with vanilla looking head. A swirl, and it smells very familiar. Smells like malt, maybe a little coffee, roasted goodness. A few small tastes and I wasn't impressed. It was a little disappointing at first. Got better with each sip. The last couple were really smooth like a good creamy dessert. I want more! A fully circle experience. Not hooked but not turned off either. Will be interested in seeing what a little age does to these. 679 charactersPEESHALEODEJANARO, Jan 09, 2016

L- Cloudy dark brown and not much of a head, but appearance is not that important.
S- Complex fruity and spicy aroma. Interesting and inviting.
T- Wow, it blew me away the first time I had it (now I had many). The taste was bready toasted malts, caramel, raisins, some spices, not too much, well balanced, and not a hint of alcohol despite the high alcohol content. It was easy drinking even for my friends who prefer blander styles.
F- silky smooth creamy. 656 charactersThomas_Wikman, Jan 08, 2016

Pours a very murky, dirty brown color. Head is tan and 1/4th of an inch. Sediment is very evident throughout tasting. Head retention and lacing were above average. 
Smell is big on dried and candied fruits, dates, figs, even some apricot. Belgian rock candy is also very present. Slight soy sauce is there, hops are not, and alcohol is definitely there.
Taste is heavy on caramelized sugar, dates, and figs. Burnt malt is also apparent, with belgian yeast/ witch hazel also present. Hops arent present but alcohol flavor is high.   
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation.  Head retention added slightly to the substance of the beer. 
Overall this was a good beer but dont know how it was once regarded as the best beer in the world. It was a solid beer for the style but there was nothing in the flavor profile that stood out to me. 893 charactersangelmonster, Jan 08, 2016

Taste...  Speechless.  Dried figs, and apricots.  Some many subtle flavor including vanilla and Carmel .  So smooth.  No bite from alcohol.

4.64/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep reddish brown from the bottle. I was surprised by the carbonation, giving a creamy off-white head that remained for some time before settling down to a nice foam. I love the nose of bready malt mixed with Belgian yeast, then comes the fruit. Raisins, fig and prunes, giving way to candy and cloves. The candy is more prominent on the tongue, along with a bit of alcohol. Such a nice blend of fruit and spice. As for the mouth, it starts silky smooth, then becomes somewhat dry and crisp. This stands apart from the St. Bernardus Abt 12 moreso than I expected. Both are fine, excellent beers. Westvleteren, to me, has slightly more depth in all areas. It's wonderful. 679 charactersMartzMimic, Jan 01, 2016

Appearance: Pours a deep brownish amber with a moderate amount of bubbles. Solid finger of off white head that settles into a thin creamy layer that sticks around. 
Smell: A very juicy and nicely sweet yeast driven aroma with a big scent of dark fruit, spices, and caramel. Belgian yeast with hints of funk, clove, pepper, and cinnamon. Big presence of fruit with hints of dark grapes, raisin, cherry, fig, plum, prune, dates, banana, pear, and apple. Malt hints of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, straw, and mild chocolate. Sweet hints of candied sugar. Nice hints of leather and tobacco as well as some light anise. Hops are pretty subtle. A really great aroma. 
Taste: As great as it smells, a juicy, spicy, and sweet yeast driven taste with notes of dark fruit, spice, and caramel malt. Belgian yeast with good spice notes of clove, pepper, cinnamon, and funk. Lots of fruit with notes of dark grapes, fig, raisin, plum, cherry, prune, dates, banana, apple, and pear. Sweet taste of Belgian candied sugar. Toasted malt notes of caramel, toffee, biscuit, toast, straw, and subtle chocolate. Also some notes of tobacco, leather, and slight anise. Hops are very light. A really great taste. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a medium to high level of carbonation. Juicy, creamy, and drying on the finish. Alcohol heat is minimal. 
Overall: A truely great Quad that lives up to it's status as one of the best beers in the world. Great complex blend of fruit flavors, spice, and caramel malt. Glad I finally got my hands on a bottle. 1,629 charactersMattyG85, Jan 01, 2016

Sitting by the wood stove with my son and a gift bottle spirited out of Belgium.  Strong presence right out of the bottle.  It is perhaps, one of the most complex & full beer experiences in 50 years of brewing appreciation.  Each taste provides a different layer for the senses.  It has the weight of a barleywine but is so much more delicate.  Licorice, chocolate, cardamon, anise, coffee, spruce they are all present but understated.  The finish is long lasting & very clean/dry.  This is something that should be sought after by anyone who is serious about making the leap into the very best the brewing world has to offer. 678 charactersatget57, Dec 26, 2015

Possibly more aroma and flavor. Seems to be on the bitter end. Anyways, poured from a bottle. Nice dark caramel body. Big fluffy head. Tastes is huge dark roast with tons of sweet prunes. 305 characterskkleu357, Dec 15, 2015

We tried a few other "copies" as he called it on the tour, but this by far was the best beer i had while there. Just as the pic shows, it was a plain brown bottle and he advised us to keep the cap as evidence we have actually had this elusive beer. Its an online lottery system to get the beer from the abbey, and you need to submit your license and license plate number and show up without one of the two and they will not sell you the beer. crazy. 667 charactersKevingbecker, Dec 11, 2015
4.51/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75A: The beer is very dark brown in color (black when viewed from afar).  It poured with a half finger high light tan colored head that died down, leaving a short head covering the surface and a coating of bubbles around the edge of the glass.  When held up to the light, I can make out some clumps of yeast floating near the bottom of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of dark fruits are present in the nose along with notes of malty sweetness and hints of candi sugars.
T: Similar to the smell, the taste is dominated by flavors of dark fruits—plums and prunes seem to stand out in particular—and has some malty and candi sugar sweetness along with hints of clumpy yeast.  Only faint bits of alcohol are perceptible.
M: It feels a bit more than medium-bodied and a little smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This quadrupel bursts out with lots of flavors of dark fruits and associated sweetness but is quite drinkable considering its strength because it does a very good job at hiding its alcohol.  Comparing this to my notes for the Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt. 12, I didn't pick up any of the spices that I picked up in those other beers—this one seems to be fruitier.

4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This was a long time coming. I've been sitting on both direct from the Abbey and the US "XII" labeled bottles.
This is the best version of the style I have ever tried. People comparing ABT to Westy and claiming they are close...not to me. 
On the nose are baking spices, brown sugar, dates, and the slightest bits of bready malt and cocoa.
Taste follows the nose. All dark fruits, candied dates, brown sugar and some booze. Then the carbonation comes along and cleans everything up. To me that is the only problem, a bit too many bubbles for my liking for the style and hence the reduction in points. 
Overall great experience and worth seeing out even if only once. 669 charactersMS22, Dec 05, 2015

Patience is a virtue with quads and this one is no exception.  A belgian quad symphony but with a caveat, though, that Abt 12 is just a notch below and at a fraction of the retail and / or trading price.  I'm glad I tried this for the first time but won't plan to seek it out again. 418 charactersbowzer4birdie, Dec 04, 2015

Smooth, malty, spicy and complex, without the high viscosity of many American and other Belgian quads.
It's somewhat light bodied for a beer of this size, which works well. As the Belgians call it "digestable".
Had it once again recently, a leftover from 12/12/12  and once again it was fantastic! This is one beer that definitely lives up to the "hype" ! Truly one of the top ten beers In the world!! 504 charactersmadbrewer9, Nov 30, 2015

Smell – It is hard to nail the nose on this one. I will say it resembles smoky prunes. 
Taste – Malty prunes is a good start on the description. There is syrup, raisins, and a higher than expected level of carbonation that brushes away the sweetness. The dark fruits linger in the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel – I was a little surprised by the high carbonation. It brushed aside the sweetness, making the aftertaste drier than expected. 
Overall – I admit was expecting a little more. Is the carbonation a symptom of this batch being off? Or is the high machine to forceful on this one? 707 charactersJohnnyHopps, Nov 16, 2015

4.44/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Entered from my notes of October 18.  This opportunity was provided by the incredibly generous snaotheus upon his return from a trip to Belgium.  I compared this to Rochefort 10 and ABT 12 side by side.
Color is dark mahogany with a dense tan head that faded pretty quickly.  Smell is all about the yeast and booze - it has a very complex blend of dark fruits, toffee, some honey, and of course, booze.  Flavor is dark fruit, brown sugar and booze - very nice.  Body is not as full as I expected - medium with a light carbonation.  Overall, it's a great beer and deserves its reputation.  In the comparison to the other beers, it was the winner - with a very similar flavor profile to the ABT 12.  Surprisingly to me, the Rochefort 10 paled in comparison to the other two.  I'd like a chance to repeat the tasting to see if that verdict holds - anyone else want to bring me a bottle of W12?  :^) 896 charactersmr-jj, Nov 09, 2015

Suffice to say that my favourite pub owner ordered a couple of bottles for our little gathering, and even at CDN$20/bottle, it was worth the try. Clearly, at that price, I would not make a habit of purchasing it (though some other pubs sell it for as much as CDN$40). 
But I digress.
The nose, the head, the taste - all top class. Strong hints of grapes and so much more overwhelms your senses, just as Heady Topper does. 
Brilliance in a bottle. Still, St. Bernardus easily beats it. 551 charactersCramshawbar, Nov 08, 2015

Not overly spiced like many of the entries from Unibroue or Ommegang nor overly sweet either.  There's an excellent harmony between the yeast, spice, sugar, and alcohol notes in this beer that ultimately make this a wonderfully balanced and complex beer. 661 charactersLAp, Nov 01, 2015

4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Here we go! After waiting for a long time I finally got my hands on one of these. Dark liquid, the color of a dark date, surmounted by a beige head that lasts for a long long time and formed by big bubbles. The aroma is so very rich. Dates, figs, dark sugar, almonds, marzipan, honey. Comparing it to Rochefort 10, it promises to be sweeter and less on the fruity side. The taste is a bit weaker than I expected but still phenomenal. Dark fruits, bread and no alcohol whatsoever. I believe I have some bitter aftertaste, on grassy notes, but not very pronounced. Creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. In the end, an exquisite beer. However, is this the absolute king of quads? I believe it's overall pretty close to Rochefort 10, and extra points might be due to the hype. Don't get me wrong, I think this reputation is deserved, but should be shared with another beer! 872 charactersRickyS, Oct 29, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5330mL bottle from the fall 2012 American release. Served in a pretentious, matching gold-rimmed Westvleteren XII goblet. 
Pours a turbid, dark chestnut with a three quarter finger cap of beige head. Some sort of yeast or particulate is visible in suspension. The foam settles to a beautiful, full, fluffy halo and a wide lingering island. Only a few scattered specks of lace find purchase. 
The aroma is fruity with a good but of sweet Belgian yeast up front. Toffee, dark fruit, brown sugar, cocoa and bread round and it the nose. Very nice. 
The flavor explodes with dark fruit. Raisins, figs, plum, brown sugar, toffee, fruity and mildly funky Belgian yeast, semi tart cherry skin, caramel, bread, subtle chocolate, apple, honey, hints of earth and a faint tickle of alcohol that is only occasionally noticeable. The flavors drift in and amongst each other and amount to a smooth, delicious blend with everything working in harmony. Truly delicious. 
Rich, creamy, full body with soft carbonation. Finishes with pleasing notes of toffee, dark fruit and yeast. 
Westvleteren XII definitely stands as best in class of the Belgian quadruples. The flotsam and jetsam in the body does not phase me a bit and I think this is a world class brew in every respect. The price of admission was admittedly high but I am very happy to have tried this fresh and at one and three years old. I'm looking forward to continuing to follow its development over the next five years or so. 1,475 charactersThickNStout, Oct 27, 2015

4.34/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25October 11th, 2015.  Poured from a bottle into a tulip.
Beer is a medium to dark brown with reddish-amber highlights.  Fairly modest tan head that fades fairly quickly.
Aroma is brown sugar, dates/raisins and booze.
Flavor is much like the nose, but deeper.  First note is a brown sugar note layered with caramel.  Raisins and dates follow on as a strong woody note appears.  Hotter with alcohol than I would have expected.  Finish is very clean; the only thing that hangs around is the fairly bitter wood note.
Medium-bodied - a little thinner than I expected.
I am so happy I finally got to try one of the great white whalez.  For the effort, though, I would go for a Rochefort, St. Bernardus or any other of the more easily obtained examples of this style. 764 characterscharlzm, Oct 12, 2015
4.38/5  rDev -5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Bottle. Unsure of the Vintage but it was one of the bottles with the name printed upon it. Finally get to try a Westy. Fairly excited. The G.O.A.T. of all Abbey Ales poured a light brown (lighter than many Quads) with a fizzy head of divided bubbles. Aroma is immediately better and more suited to my liking than any other Quad. Its less decadently sweet and boozy and much more complex. The malt on the nose is brown sugary but there is a dryness to it as well. Candied malt. Dark fruits without overrepresentation. Really digging the nuanced yeast character on the nose. The flavor is pretty impressive. Its drier and less cloying than any Quad I have had. It has a sort of dessert wine flavor to it as well. Maybe even a bit of a nutty element. Dried raisins and figs. Raisin bread. Some powdered chocolate? Caramel, brown sugar, toffee and the like. Lots going on. The alcohol is present in a way that adds to the hot decadence of this beer. Yet, its still more reserved than most Quads I have tried. Love that this beer somehow dries out on the finish. This isn't my favorite beer but its damn sure my favorite Quad. Happy to check this one off the list. 1,159 charactersVelvetExtract, Oct 12, 2015

Thank you monks.  You've inspired me to shave what's left of my hair, buy a brown robe, and learn to chant.
Call it lack of exposure, but I've never been a fan of this style.  Westy 12 just changed that.  I could tell you about the beautiful color it pours, the massive head it left, the scent of fruits, raisins, carmel, the wonderful mouth feel, the fact that it's not even remotely boozy for a 10% beer.  But that's all been said. 
 There is a reason its commonly referred to as the best beer in the world.

4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5At first glance an excellent looking bottle without any labels and all the information is contained on the top of the cap itself. The bottle itself seems like something a person would keep for a souvenir. 
I poured it in a Westvleteren chalice (the larger of two). It is a very dark brown (almost black) looking beer, with lacey head. It seems very "thick". The smell has caramel characteristic (Belgian candi) and although it has high alcohol content, it does not have a strong alcoholic smell.  
The first taste already confirms the strong caramel/candi taste along with some spices. You can feel it warm you up a bit while travelling through your throat. It packs a nice punch which you don't really expect from such a nice and drinkable beer.  
After drinking I strongly recommend to wash the glass because the leftover candi will become hard and it will be more difficult to remove it later. 899 charactersAndrijas, Sep 30, 2015

In any event I should say something, because Westvleteren 12 is a phenomenal beer across all categories.  The pour into a snifter featured a rich mahogany body with a billowing cap of very persistent khaki foam that left sheets of lacing.  Entirely attractive and impressive.  The nose is all about dark dried fruits.. dates, figs, raisins, and a hint of candied faintly caramelly sweetness which is oh so smooth.  You can sniff this for a long time, it's very enjoyable.  Taste is exactly right IMO with dark fruity raisins, dates, molasses, brown sugar, bready, toffee, faint chocolate.  Lightly sweet throughout but a very balanced with all the depth of flavors working together toward the whole.  Mouthfeel is luxury, velvety, nice.  Full bodied but enough carb to keep it interesting.  Fantastic.  Maybe I'll get to try it again someday.. 1,134 charactersJackieTH, Sep 24, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A- Pours a beautiful, murky, deep brown in color. There is just a touch of copper-reddish color peeking through the edges of the beer in the light. For a beer that has been in the bottle 3 years, this still pours fairly vigorously, with a decent sized, 1.5 finger thick head. The head sticks around a very long time and laces very well as well. All in all, the pour is very impressive looking in the glass.
S- Huge dark fruit flavors greet the nose in a pleasant and slightly tart aroma. Dates, figs, and even a touch of bright and juicy grapes are the prominent scents hitting the nose. After the fruit, there is an understated candy sugar component of the beer that sweetens and balances out the fruits. Just a touch of caramel malt flavor is evident at the very end of the scent.
T- The much anticipated first sip of this beer results in a wave of complex and dark flavors over the tongue. The first flavor that displays itself is a mild caramel malt that is quickly joined by a brown sugar and candy sugar sweetness. The sweetness is quickly washed away by the dark fruit flavors from the scent, that aren't quite as potent in the taste. In the middle part of the drink, the bitter component of the malts' flavors take over and really move the flavor of the beer to the darker side of things. The fruits make a small comeback at the very end of the drink and it washes away with both the fruits and the malt/alcohol bitterness left on the tongue.
M- I was expecting this beer to be closer to flat after 3 years in the bottle, but it is highly carbonated, yet smooth and thick as it moves across the palate. While the beer itself is a relatively easy drinker, the alcohol warmth after the drink and as it goes down makes drinking this beer a little slower.
Overall, this beer lived up to its hype for me, but in an unexpected way. I was expecting a mellowed out beer that possibly had some evidence of some oxidation, but what I got was a great pour with good carbonation and flavor that had complicated with age. The flavors themselves were complex and didn't have as much dark fruit as expected. Instead, the beer displayed good amounts of bitter malts and brown sugar sweetness. I may have aged this one a little past its peak, but all in all, this is still a world class beer. 2,287 charactersboilermakerbrew, Sep 11, 2015

It lived up to everything people had to say about it.
The raisin/fig flavor is the more forefront.  There is a smooth sugary after taste that lasts until the net sip.  The thicker texture keeps your mouth coated just long enough to keep the flavors to stick around.
Glad I am working in Germany for a few months, so that I can stock up on this!! 423 charactersjonesry09, Sep 10, 2015

The beer pours dark brown with a little hint of copper and is hazy. Almoust compact liquid. 
A two finger high, beige, head that dissapears pretty quick and leaves lacing. 
Nose: Soft touch of yeast, dark bread, fruity esters, plum, raisin, dark fruit, caramel malt, brown sugar, toffee and molasses. It's a very sweet nose! So wonderful nose - I could stay here, just feeling the nose...
Taste: Wow! Brown sugar, caramel malt, carmelized sugar, some dark notes of coffee and leather, dark bread, riasin, dried fruit and molasses. It's beatiful!
Body: Medium body and carbonation. A bitterness that works together with the sweet malt. Thick, complex structure. 
I just LOVE tuhis beer! It is definitely one of the best! Previously I have had a lot of St. Bernardus Abt 12 and as I've been told - It i pretty close! But this is the master :) 919 characterscraftbeersweden, Aug 27, 2015

A — Pours a deep ruby amber hue into the glass. Quite dark and rich looking. Puffy and sticky light mocha colored head forms and leaves some sticky lacing behind. There is also a fair amount of sediment in the beer, even with a slow and steady pour.
S — Smells quite bright initially, lots of dark fruits, plums, figs, raisins, light cherry component as well. Lots of yeasty character. Big hit of caramel and molasses sweetness as well.
T — Lots of stone fruits and quite a bit sweeter than expected to be honest. Lots of bright sweet fruits and a little bit of a caramel sweetness. As it warms there is a bit of an oaky component and a bit of nuttiness.
M — Medium bodied, long and sweet lingering finish.
O — Very good overall, though it is lighter than anticipated. There is still a great depth of flavor, and it is worth seeking out, just temper expectations. 926 charactersMoose90, Aug 19, 2015

Flavour starts sweet, goes into a toffee sweet-/softness, a slight touch of bitterness breaks the sweet notes. Extremely well balanced palate, all elements blend perfect into each other and none of them dominate. Has a touch of warming alcohol in the finish. 377 charactersDoderlein_Bacillus, Aug 11, 2015

In an oversized goblet, it poured a quarter-inch head that dissipated quickly. The color is a rich opaque brown with some sediment floating near the top. 
Aromas of overripe plums, figs, dates, and maybe even apricot. The alcohol is present on the nose, too, along with a major sugar character. It's rich but not overpowering. Absolutely lovely. 
Wow, this is the quad to beat. Rich fig, molasses, and carmelized brown sugar. It's hitting all of the right notes. 
The mouthfeel is luxurious: stilly lightly carbonated with some creamy juiciness. I'm not sure how else to describe it. The alcohol has just the slightest singe, but it's extremely drinkable. 
I have my brother-in-law and his sergeant to thank for this, and I'm so grateful for the experience. This is truly world-class, and one of the top three best beers I have ever enjoyed. 868 charactersRanz, Aug 10, 2015

Mouth full is perfect for a quad. Thick with the taste lingering.

F - prickly with bright carb. Slightly creamy with a sweet finish

4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle dark chocolate brown with a light creamy head into a short tulip snifter.  The deep aroma of chocolate and spice invited you to sip.  As this nectar  dances on your taste buds you notice that although the ABV is over 10%, it is almost unnoticeable as the rich body of the beer and robust flavors reminiscent of dark roast coffee, figs, and roasted barley fill your mind.  The experience is likened to a display of fireworks, with each new wave of flavors replacing those previously held and combining to form a symphony on your mouth.

One of the most complex brews I've ever experienced.... 735 charactersWertMaker, Jul 26, 2015
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5As tasted, this was an offering/bottling of March 2015...relatively young.  I tasted this at a buds house alongside St. Bernardus abt 12, KBS, FBS, Wootstout, and some non-related FFF IPA/APA's.  I drank/sampled the St. Bernardus 12 first and then the Westy 12 right after.  Although I'd say this beer and St. Bernardus have a similar backbone, the Westy 12 wins hands down for complexity.  Upon the first swig, the complexity hits you and leaves you wondering how such a small taste can produce so many exquisite flavors in a beer!  The same taste as St. Bernardus 12 is there, yet has so much more going on, including more alcohol in the front.  As the beer warms up, it opens the flavor even more and made me want to savor each sip slowly and methodically to get all that this beer had to offer, which is more than any beer I've ever had has.  Enough said!  Totally worthy of the hype and a top three world wide place in history! 932 charactersgcrfire3, Jul 26, 2015

4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottled 2014. Had this side-by-side with a St. Bernardus Abt 12 - no contest the Westy is superior in every way.
Westvleteren 12 looks like fizzy molasses and smells like a cake that was baked in an enchanted forest by elves. Barely any head, though the beer decided to start rising slowly from the bottle the moment the cap came off. Taste is complex, rich like a spiced cake, boozy but with a heat that only threatens to burn, then gracefully segues into the smoothest finish. Incredible mouthfeel, carbonation was just right. Obviously I had high expectations going into this and I'm glad I had it next to the St. Bernardus Abt 12 (supposedly based upon the same recipe) for some enlightening context. 705 charactersRothobinide, Jul 20, 2015

4.78/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This was a really old bottle that was given to me by a friend about 2 years ago. I was worried to open it and wanted to save it for a special occasion. It was cellared and forgotten. The best by date on top was 2/2015 so I'm drinking it a bit late. I normally wouldnt post a review of something that's gone bad, but let me tell you this is by no means bad!
Look: Tawny brown/reddish almost like nice leather, a foamy thick white head and some noticeable sediment. Could be build up from it being old.
Smell: Deep dark figs/raisin. Bready yeast aroma. Smells absolutely delicious. 
Taste: Wow!!! you can tell this has developed. Its extremely well balanced and has a lot going on. Sweet caramel booze, dark raisins and plum, bread. Exactly what I wanted to taste from a legendary quad.
Feel: Medium body, no lingering bitterness just a nice sweet bread like flavor left behind.
Overall: I wish this bottle wasn't empty..... 927 charactersBeerBrose, Jul 15, 2015

Pours perfect for a Belgian Strong Dark - off white head which settles into a cloud and dark amber body. Nose is light for the flavor, but you get the fruit and sugars from the taste. Flavor includes plums, raisins, figs - sugary fruits. 353 charactersJesstyr, Jul 13, 2015

Trappist Westvleteren 12 – bottling date 02.12.2014 – Best Before 02.12.2017
Appearance: Dark brown, almost black,  slightly off white head. Excellent head retention. Head is very creamy and made up of tightly packed bubbles. Some lacing that has dried out on side of glass as I am taking my time to drink this thick, sticky brew.
Aroma: Port wine and malt.
Taste: Brown bread. Long lasting sweet, malty Horlicks aftertaste. All bran with warm milk taste is quite strong. Port in the middle. What really stands out is just how long the taste lasts after swallowing. 
Mouth feel: Smooth, creamy and dry at the end.
Overall: I was extremely tired when reviewing this (did the rating in Brussels on a different occasion) and unfortunately was unable to pick out the aromas as I would have liked. Will revisit. Prefer this over the Rochefort 10 that I had last night, but this is a little older and IF the Rochefort 10 is anything like the 8, it tastes much better with a little longer behind it, once the yeast has settled down. 1,044 charactersMrDell, Jul 12, 2015

Tons of flavor. Clove, raisins, figs, yeast, baked pie crust. SO much complexity and depth.

Appearance: Cloudy Amber brown with ridiculous amount of bubbles. Head is an off-white thin piece hanging off the body rising about a notch above a finger's length. 
Smell: Weakest property of the brew doesn't make it bad at all, yeast and grapes. Dissipates very quickly from the nose after a sniff. 
Taste: Malts with grapes and a shot of yeast. Moves you, makes you think is it an after dessert drink or dinner brew. It's perfect for any occasion. 
Mouth: Sticky and thin bodied with medium to heavy carbonation. Settles more to the level of bread with a smooth light sour finish. 
Overall: Honor and a pleasure, lives up to the hype. Not loving this beer means you don't love beer. Salud! 765 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Jul 05, 2015

Thick creamy head, deep ruby color led the way for spicy, fruity scents. Taste was spot on. Definitely similar to St. Bernardus Abt 12 but it had something more (maybe just the name?). Mouthfeel was great with a sharp but short kick of alcohol spice at the finish. So happy to finally have this beer. 420 charactersLouski, Jun 26, 2015

This was tasted blind as part of a gauntlet throw Quad throwdown against Rochefort 10 and Bernardus 12. 
It had some age on it but still had the largest head which was downright mindblowing to me. The flavors had softened with time and it makes me thing it would be an outright 5 if tasted brand new but the alcohol was still present in the aroma and the flavor profile. It was without a doubt worth the effort to get her but I don't foresee myself putting up the effort to do it again. 605 characterscraftaholic, Jun 22, 2015

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought a bottle in middle of Brussels, Belgium on Dec 29, 2014. 
Decided to open it for a celebration on June 1st, 2015.
It blew me away. Very complex taste. A lot of dark fruit smell and taste. Some maltiness.
The dark fruit taste of grape and prune came out even more when it is warmer. Some hint of alcohol, but not that much. With every taste, it is even better.
Worth the hype and is somewhat cheap for the quality. I would love to have another one again, if it's not too damn difficult to find in the US. 510 characterssokol_1993, Jun 03, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Simply divine! I saved a couple bottles and finally opened one up. It reminds me of champagne. Freshness date: 2/25/2018
A: Dark red/amber in color with a thin, white head which appears to be a thick, creamy foam. It never dissipates and seems to coat the top of the beer. There is also an abundance of fizzy bubbles within the beer.
S: Raisins, grapes, mixed fruits, some sweetness, hint of alcohol. Smells a lot like red wine and has some banana, cloves and mixed spices as well.
T: No flavor stands out as it is extremely balanced. Some mild sweetness to it combined along with notes of grapes and raisins.
M: Medium amount of carbonation, champagne like. There really is no bitterness or dryness either. Has a creaminess/smoothness to it that is simply divine.
O: Very good!! I wish I was able to acquire more, but I guess i'll save my last bottle for a very special occasion!! 886 charactersMA_hops, May 31, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Drank from Westy 12 chalice.  This was last of a case ordered a few months ago.   Stored at 57 degrees and drank the same temp.   The case was fresh, so this was only a two to three months old - very young for this beer.   Below is a summary of that wonderful case.
Look: Dark Brown with a one finger head, smallish bubbles which would mostly go away in about ten to twenty minutes 
Smell: Fruit and brown sugar - can pick up the Alcohol but not overpowering. 
Taste: Fantastic and consistent this quad is. The flavors are not trumped by the the alcohol at any point.   Wonderful flavor that lasts long after the last swallow. 
Feel:  Wonderful thick mouth feel.
Best dark powerful beer I have ever had.  Won on multiple side by sides with the other trappest quads.   But not by a huge amount, but definitely a noticeable edge.   I don't agree with those who say this is not as good as Rochefort 10.   But Captain Obvious wil tell you (and I agree) that the difference is not as great as the cost differential ($20 for the Westy against Rochefort at 6 bucks) 1,063 charactersShort-Pour, May 29, 2015
4.91/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Presentation: 12oz bottle that my uncle brought from Belgium. Approx 60 degrees F.  Opened 5/25/15 Freshness date 1/14/18.
Look: Poured into tulip glass. Foggy dark brown color with tiny particles floating in it and with a finger of off-white head of small bubbles that faded quickly. Beautiful in the glass. 
Smell: Malt. Toast. Dark Fruit. Cherry. Yeast. Alcohol. 
Taste: Extremely smooth through the whole process of drinking. All of the above flavors with a nice sweetness towards the end which hides the alcohol. 
Overall, the best beer that I have had. Definitely the best Quad that I've had.  A joy and pleasure to drink. Unfortunately my uncle insisted on sharing it with others who don't know beer and who appreciated it a lot less...frustrating. 759 charactersaugusttag, May 29, 2015

I have had the pleasure of tring a 3 year aged version and a fresh 4 month old one. Aging improved this beer. Both were excellent but the aged version gave new flavors and put the yeast as a role player rather than the main character. Subtle sweetness not normally found in the style.

Is it worth the hype? No. Is is a good beer? Yes. 
I have tried two different "vintages" of this beer; one was aged for five years before consumption, the other for two years. The tastes really did not change that much over time. 
I would not want to drink much more than a one or two  ounce pour of Westy 12. A small splash at a tasting is enough to give you a sense of what this beer is about and an appreciation for what it represents. 
I had it once and felt that was enough to satisfy a curiosity for this lifetime. 
Do not go trading whales for it. 610 charactersrodmanfor3, May 24, 2015

A: Dark brown, murky, nice finger of tan frothy head.
S: Grape, caramel, plums, reminiscent of a nice wine. No alcohol at all. That distinctive belgian yeast character in the background. Little bit of breadyness. Mild spices. 
T: Dark fruits, raisins, plums, pears, grapes, belgian yeast, spices, cloves. Delicious multilayered kind of flavor. 
M: Medium body, medium carbonation but no bite. Coats the mouth and then its gone.
O: Fantastic. Great example of the style and probably the best quad I've ever had. I think that it is definitely better than abt 12, but not by a lot. Worth the trouble to acquire, but there are a lot of other great quads that aren't as hard to get. 836 characterschrisjws, May 16, 2015

330ml bottle at a bar called Monk in Brussels. Best price I've seen in the city, including the stores -- 9.50 euros. 18.12.17 is the date on the cap. Served in a Chimay chalice.
Pours dark brown with a big creamy head that dissipates slowly. Tiny active carbonation. Smell is dark fruit and yeast. Strong date aroma. Lots of raisins and prunes.
Taste is brighter and livelier than Rochefort 10 (my immediately prior beer). Less dates and raisins, maybe more plum. Some overripe cherry.
Mouthfeel is rich, but light. Fluffy. Overall, very good beer. 562 characterssnaotheus, May 14, 2015

It's official, I have a new number one beer now. This one was a fantastic beer & definitely lives up to the hype. A huge depth of flavour to the beer & so much going on, this one seemed to excel. Exceptional balance with no single flavour seeming to dominate and the beer going down far easier that a 10.2% beer should do. Despite the hefty price tag, this one was worth every penny & is definitely one I'll be trying to find again, it was that good. 504 charactersflyingpig, May 08, 2015

It really seems to need some more time in the bottle prior to tasting.  With that said, it is not hard to imagine how the flavors will develop over the next year or two. Multiple layers of flavor, with burnt caramel, espresso, malt, date syrup, and other fruit in the background. Will likely have to update this review at a later date after tasting a more mature bottle. 463 characterscaptaincoffee, Apr 17, 2015

Second taste: on 30 Oct 2015. Bought special pack at XXXII (75€) In Westvletern glass. Watching "Circuito Cerrado". Perfect in all aspects. Great smell, can be enjoyed by only smelling it. With the years its alcohol is less noticeable, it improves a lot in taste and feel

4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Generally I am not a huge fan of quads, but damned if this one isn't solid as hell. I saw some posts today so I figured that I would go ahead and tick this one off the list!
Appearance: Murky very dark chestnut colored. Lots of foamy frothy head develops in the pour. 
Aroma: Winelike aroma. Nice ripe grape and plum aromas in there. Not as estery as one would think from a Belgian quad. 
Taste: Very well made beer. Some Belgian yeast esters in there, but it does not have that clove spice note that is every present in many of them. The wine ripe grape and plum fruits shine on the palate as well. Finish is very clean and dry for such a dark beer.
Overall: I wasn't sure about this one considering my past experiences with quads, I mean like them alright but this one certainly lives up to the hype and the complexities are there to a point I really cannot convey as well as others, but its well worth the ratings it once had as number 1 beer in the world and maybe should be closer than it used to be. I am just happy I had the opportunity to give it a try! 1,065 charactershumuloner22, Mar 11, 2015

4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a chalice.
I'm surprised by a gusher of head when I pop the cap off, but after getting this under wraps and pouring into the wide-mouthed chalice, I'm able to sit back and admire a wondrous finger thick head that looks almost like whipped butter in its thick, heavy composition. There's a tinge of plum-color to the otherwise cream-colored head. The body is plum-colored with a good dose of dark brown to it and immense, relentless carbonation surging upward. A bit of yeast accumulates at the base of the glass but this is mostly clean-looking. 
A nose of pungent dark fruit, faint sweet caramel and vague spice first catch my notice. A creamy berry quality drifts in and out. My overall impression is subtlety reigns here but what I do smell is lovely. 
Well then, that's a creamy sweet beast with a bit of a spicy edge. There's an exceptional balance of flavors and feels here, especially with regard to the yeast and malt which impart neither the pungent nor overly floral flavors that I find in many Belgians. Instead I find a light touch of dark fruit, restrained vanilla and caramel and a grassy and floral finish that have a bit of bite. If you let the beer warm a bit, you'll start to notice some chocolatey notes too. 
There's a surprisingly assertive bitterness to this beer, more than I think I've ever noticed on any other quad before, but there's also the most impeccably creamy body to this that I think any beer has ever offered me. The sweetness is tasteful and even understated and the yeast, while peppery, doesn't overrun the mouth with that acrid feel some Belgian or Belgian-style beers suffer from. 
Well, if there's one thing that I can say separates this from other quads I've had and makes it worthy of the hype it's the great feel with each sip. Plenty of going on, but the creamy smoothness is worthy of numerous swirls and even then you'll be tempted to simply let the beer sit on your palate before saying good bye forever. 1,993 charactersONovoMexicano, Mar 03, 2015

(drank 2/23/15)
L:  murky brown-orange ... relatively light with lots of amber/orange in it; huge tan foam head
S:  dusty raisins ... mustiness is undeniable, but so are the dark fruits behind it
T:  super sweet, fruity ... raisin bread ... same mustiness as nose but flavor is much sweeter than the aroma; slight caramel
F:  perfect ... tons of carbonation mixed with good weight is super nice
O:  didn't get to drink a full bottle, but the sample was interesting -- side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12, it clearly came in third but was still very good.  the mustiness had a quality I tried and tried to place but couldn't other than to say musty. 713 charactersPremo88, Feb 25, 2015

It puts a light brown with almost no head. The to maintains a thin white lace throughout. It smells rich, like a dessert. Loaded with dates and figs behind a musky funk. The taste follows the nose exactly. Sticky fruit with a sugary back round. The only thing keeping this from being a perfect taste is the backend is a little too sweet. Mouthful is medium thickness with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, had the sweetness on the back end been toned down it would have been a great beer but I was a little disappointed. 734 charactersmlhyatt, Feb 25, 2015

I always thought that maybe this beer was mostly hype and that it wasn't worth the trouble when I could easily get a Rochefort 10 or similar.  I was wrong.  It is amazing.  Dates and raisins and some complex yeast magic.  Almost made me swoon it is so good.  I ordered 6 from Belgium and happily paid the crazy shipping.

Taste is chewy caramel with dark fruits and a little lingering sweetness, a bit of a vinous character save for the carbonation. Delicious. Crisp carbonation on a more than medium body, feels wonderful on the palate. I could drink k this beer every day of my life, but I like it as a rare treat.

I remember tasting it and fully expecting it to be a normal Belgian Quad, as I had tried so many of the easier to obtain versions of the style (and some of them are so damn good). I had read before that the hype around Westvleteren was truly just that: Hype. Only because of the rarity did people say it was better than the others. I try to not buy into hype. But then I tasted it, and it truly was special. There was something different, a yeasty note which I have never tasted elsewhere. I later bought a Westy 8 in Belgium and opened it with the guy who let me try his bottle of XII, and it had the same "special" character. 702 charactersallforbetterbeer, Jan 25, 2015

All I can say is that this is by far the best example of a Belgian Quad that I have ever had.  Any Belgian for that matter.  It completely lives up to the hype.  the pour is nice with a tan head.  The smell has lots of dark stone fruits, rich toasted malt, maplely.  The taste just went through a rainbow of flavors, plums, raisins, dates, with maltiness, a little toastiness to name a few, with a light dry, very light hop finish.  It is incredibly complex, and continues to grow more and more complex with every sip, just building on the last.  Drink on the warmside, 50 to 55deg Fahrenheit. This beer is so smooooooooth. Just a fantastic beer.  It's one of my Top 3 Beers of all Time. 769 charactersTrapist007, Jan 22, 2015

Finish is grainy hop bitterness over toasted malt with biscuit wafting back in.

Epic beer but....... not sure its the best.  
8/7/16 - Sampled with a rochefort 10 and these two are the king of quads.  Westy is more subtle and complex as it warms.  As the roch flavors are a tad more intense upfront but doesn't quite  have the finesse as westy. 474 charactersIPA1978, Jan 15, 2015

Served from bottle into special Westvleteren glass. 
Deep dark red color with frothy head. 
Strong smell, bit boozy with plethora of fruit. 
Rich sweet taste, the booziness comes through a bit as well. Strong, but not overwhelming. Very clean and smooth. 
This beer is worth the hype. If you can find it, snag it. 
Got another bottle that will be aged. 545 charactersArminius757, Jan 11, 2015

4.29/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Bottle from the cellar, marked 27-03-15. Dark reddish root beer brown with five fingers of sudsy beige foam. Rich sweet nose: Milk chocolate, sultanas, rum toffee,  faint clove, banana chips, strawberry, subdued grassy hops. The aroma does live up to the hype. And the taste? I do understand the comparisons with St. Bernardus Abt 12 (allegedly these beers are the same recipe, different yeast strain). A supremely well-integrated combination of toffee/candy sugar, carob, molasses, cooked fruit (pears and mixed berries), clove-like phenols, licorice, grapes, root beer extract, ginger, plum liquor ... Heady alcohol bloom is the icing on the cake. Although the initial sips are sharply medicinal and boozy, the beer mellows in the glass and on the palate such that the great nuances shine though. Curiously dry and "drinkable" with a lighter than expected body and rather prickly mouthfeel. Some floral hops poke out in the otherwise cacao-like malty finish. Red berry and currant flavors are lingering long after my glass is empty. "Best beer in the world" is not a debate that can ever truly be resolved but this is certainly worthy of the accolades bestowed. Maybe the rarity factor used to play a role here ... With improved availability will the hype wither a bit? Not sure it matters. Worthy of its place in the Trappist pantheon. 1,338 charactersCalgaryFMC, Jan 09, 2015

I detect the aroma of dark candy sugar and dark malt.  The flavor is a nice blend of dark malt and candy sugar.  Light notes of caramel and molasses are also noticeable.
The mouth is exceptionally velvety smooth, creamy,and bone dry. 355 charactersFranziskaner, Jan 04, 2015

The pour was nothing terribly impressive. It had a nice brown-red color with a thin head and low carbonation. The nose was very muted and disappointing but still smelled delicious. There was dark fruit, plum, some brown sugar, and raisins in the nose. The flavor was delightful though. All the smells came through in the taste only intensified. The belgian yeast was present but not overpowering. The candied dark fruit was the star of the show. It was incredibly smooth and easy to drink. Full bodied without being heavy, low carb without being flat, and no alcohol detectable. 
This beer is the real deal and worthy of the hype. The nose was disappointing and it's not much to look at but other than that, this one is close to perfect. 853 charactersPSU_Mike, Dec 26, 2014

A great dark and strong abbey beer, despite it's high alcohol percentage it is very drinkable though a bit sharp down the hatch.

Big, Fruity and Robust. Also Smooth, Tasty and Enjoyable... Ridiculously drinkable at +10% waves of Dark Fruit, Brown Sugar, Cream Soda, Vanilla, Oak, Cinnamon and Caramel slap the palette. Undertones of Yeast, Grapes, Chocolate, Cherry, Clove and Nut are present. Butterscotch, Banana, Licorice, Fig and Tobacco can be picked up in the after taste. The aroma is much like Christmas spice with Plums, Brandy, and Wine being picked up. The feel is medium and bubbly. I really can't pick out a flaw, may be a bit 'too much' (complexity and ABV) for a novice, other wise I don't have a single bad thing to say. Overall this brew is amazing and well worth the hunt~ 825 charactersClePaul, Nov 09, 2014

Smell: dark fruit, plum, sweet Carmel, cream brûlée , some vanilla .Taste:  wow, amazing. A lot like the nose, caramel, plum, some dark cherry,vanilla, perfect sweetness.  Mouth feel: scary drinkable, slight creaminess, not a lot of carb, not as thick as I expected.  Overall: I did this side by side with abt 10 and roch 12, and this was a clear winner. I will admit that this is the only aged bottle but wow does this live up. Doing it side by side to fresh bottles show how amazingly the beer ages.  usually after 4 years a beer's flavors have blended TOO well, but this is magic. So happy to finally have opened this. The beauty of this beer lies in its world-class balance. 736 charactersbrewtus, Nov 04, 2014

5/5  rDev +8.5%In order to properly rate this beer, one must also consider the journey that is required to enjoy this brew at its home in Westvleteren, Belgium. The fruity, complex taste is complemented by the atmosphere of enjoying this in the hop fields of western Belgium. I highly recommend taking the trip to Westvleteren in order to enjoy one of the best beers that I have ever had the privilege of tasting. It is truly a pilgrimage that should be taken by every serious beer lover. 473 charactersFootballtennishockeygolf, Nov 01, 2014

'08 Vintage
A- Pours a maroon/brown color with ruby hues when held to the light. A small tan head recedes to a collar that leaves some lacing.
S- The aroma is bursting with sweet over-ripe dark fruits. Masses of prunes, nice touches of raisin and fig, bubble gum Belgian candy sugar. Dried/candied pineapple is also prevalent. Slightly spicy, with hints of clove and cinnamon.
T- The flavor follows the aroma closely, with prunes and raisins in the forefront. The candy sugar and candied fruits then take over in a very sweet mid-palate. It finishes with spices (cloves and cinnamon), and lots of dryness.
M- The mouth feel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated, and very dry.
O- This is definitely the best quad I have had. It is not my favorite style, but I could drink this a lot! 819 charactersSadMachine, Oct 31, 2014

4.4/5  rDev -4.6%Has a giant beige head, while being brown-black color. 
Burned malts, plums, chocolate, hints of bread and hazelnut define the aromas. 
Rich roasted, earthy malts, plums, walnuts and hazelnuts, hints of chocolate, very complex beer. Malts turn sweeter, in a honeyed fashion, supported by chocolate and wood. Fitting carbonation helps the body from becoming too heavy - adds refreshment. Full-bodied, complex beer, pleasantly sweet with a unique character, turning into an earthy direction with hints of chocolate in it. Very smooth mouthfeel, a little oily. Warm, slightly bitter, coffeeish finish. 600 charactersaleigator, Oct 29, 2014

A: Poured into a chalice, the beer produced lots of foam at first but quickly fizzed away allowing the pour to finish - when it was finally poured fully (minus the yeast) it was a finger and a half tall made of mid sized bubbles with a tan color. It continually bubbled up from the bottom creating pockets of foam, but the retention was low.  The beer has a dark brown, leather like appearance with moderate haze, hints of auburn show as it is held to a light source.
S: Mild to medium aroma with prunes, plums, figs, red grapes. Also getting a fresh yeasty character, not traditional belgian yeast but more like bread yeast. Toast and melenoidin bread crust aromas are at the threshold levels and a spicey note that could be coming from hops or yeast phenols.
T: Huge flavor.. Tons of those dark fruit flavors - dates, prunes, figs, with a big base of bread crust, biscuits and toast. Tobacco, melenoidins, burnt sugar, slight vanilla and dark cherries also coming through at different rates. The sweetness is kept to a low level with the big spicey hop bitterness and flavor giving an earthy undertone and the yeasty character i pickup gives a surprising lager like cleanness. The phenols are kept to a minimum and there is only a hint of ethanol in the flavor (at this early age).
M: A creamy mouthfeel that gives way to a moderately high carbonation bite. There is a tingly sensation on the palette that reminds me of a bourbon barrel aged beer. Moderate body with a high amount of alcohol warming.  
O: There are no short of reviews for this beer and chances are this won’t convince you to try or not try this beer, however if you can get the beer without too much trouble - get it. Not nearly as alcohol forward as I’ve heard and I wasn’t prepared for the yeasty bread flavor that made this very interesting and more drinkable. I’ll be curious to see how my other bottles age. 1,915 charactersguityler83, Sep 30, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A: Deep amber-brown color, almost lavender with the light. Considerable bloom that slowly evaporates. Some lacing. Yeast sediment is clearly seen. Hardly any carbonation.
S: Sweet, toffee-like notes (almost like cotton candy, as some other reviewers have noticed) give way to a delightfully dry bitterness. Alcoholic content obvious but very appetizing. 
T: One of the most complex flavor profiles of any beer I have tried. At first, definite sweetness (toffee, cotton candy) and pleasantly warm alcoholic flavors dominate the palate, eventually giving way to a wonderfully dry bitterness, which accentuates the fruity, sweet malt flavors. Really good with fine chocolates or sweet, soft cheese. 
M: Medium but firm body. Very smooth but rich and substantial. 
O: A really decadent beer, best used during the dessert course or perhaps as an after dinner drink. As fine a quadrupel as any I have ever tried, and perhaps the best. Since I have only had this beer once, I resist the temptation of declaring it the best. But certainly right up there with Rochefort 12 and St. Bernardus 12. 1,089 charactersWobbly, Sep 18, 2014

5/5  rDev +8.5%It was a 2011 Vintage of the save abbey action, and I served in a Westvleteren chalice of the same event.
A: Pours a Brown caramel body with a thick caramel colored head with good rentention.
S: A sweet chocolate liquor and some caramel notes, some alcoholic notes in the end.
T: Follows the nose with a predominant chocolate flavour and some mild alcoholic spicy bitterness. When the beer warms ups some nuts and toasted malt notes appear too as dried black fruits and wooden notes.
M: Good and mild carbonation, mild warmth and creamy body. A very mild mouthfeel, making Westy more drinkable than the other high abv beers.
O:Complex still very light, high abv but not so invasive. The chocolate predominance is a good surprise, making this beer unique in it style. More delicate than Rochefort 10, but with all complexity makes a perfect balanced quad, a wonderful style, but too extreme for some. I really like Quadrupel style in all its complexity and Westvleteren XII is a perfect Quadrupel. 1,001 charactersRaphaelSC, Sep 15, 2014

3.82/5  rDev -17.1%Big thanks to FondueVoodoo for getting me this one.
Gushes a little at the pop of the cap, effervescent head atop a dark leather brown. Musty aroma; flavor is figs, dates and tobacco leaves(?). Coats tongue, bit too carbonated but not by much, feel is good but needs to overstay its welcome. 
I`ll be honest, 2nd time i try a Westy and i`m not wowed. A good Belgian ale but i prefer St-Bernardus or Rochefort. I think this is a question of the mystique overshadowing the actual beer. 485 characterspapat444, Sep 09, 2014

A: Hazy brown color with tons of light beige head. Very fluffy foam with tons of lacing.
S: What you would expect from the style: raisins, plums, spiced/banana bread. Lots of sweetness with a little tangy kind of smell that makes me think of wine.
T: Well, it follows the nose very well. You get the best balanced quad I've ever had. Good amount of banana bread, candied ginger, dried fruits and the wine like quality I got in the smell. Extremely well balanced. Alcohol is present, but compliments the tastes very well. Warm, comfy beer.
M: As you expect from such an old yeast strain: very light and fluffy with no stickiness to be found.
D: This beer is extremely drinkable and you could get a couple of these down without realising what you are doing. 
All in all, a legendary beer with old and tested heritage. A beer all beer lovers should at least taste once. 884 charactersflipper2gv, Aug 29, 2014

4/5  rDev -13.2%Tasting this beer at all was a convergence of split second timing, vacation angst, and dumb luck. Google led me to the only bar in Brussels that served it, a gorgeous place built in the 1400's I think (and last painted in the 1600's I would wager). Perhaps it was the road weary barmaid or the loco dude siting to my right who was deep into a political debate with someone sitting between us that only he could see, but I hate to say that I was not that impressed. The beer is very complex with deep malty flavors, alcohol forward, caramel and nuts, nice bitterness, but it tasted like every other quad I've ever had. And it was served at what I would call spit-warm cellar temp, which seemed wrong. If I ever find myself in Belgium again, I'm going to the brewery. No more f'ing around, because I believe in second chances. 824 characterssmallberries, Aug 23, 2014

O: Very complex, difficult to put my finger on the flavors. A bit heavy but does not at all lay on the tongue, the carbonation sees to that. A challenge to figure out, I can't wait for another opportunity to do just that. 592 charactersLehighAce06, Aug 12, 2014

It's one of the best beers in the world and Im very fortunate to have been given this amazing opportunity. I'm happy to report beer doesn't get better than this. Makes me want to visit Belgium. 727 characterstharper178, Aug 10, 2014

S: Banana, walnuts, and bready malt combine to create an aroma reminiscent of banana nut muffins. Brandied darks fruits and sweet caramel close out the nose. Fantastic.
T: Dates, plums, and a slight bitterness upfront. Long and lingering notes of brown sugar and raisins mid-palate. No perceptible alcohol which is amazing considering the ABV. Not nearly as complex or potent as the nose but still great.
M: Light bodied and effervescent. However, each sip coats the mouth and causes the flavors to linger long after each sip. 
O: Amazing how such complex flavors and aromas can be contained in such a concise package. It is almost impossible to live up to the hype that this beer has, but by far the best example of the style I've ever had. Those monks at Saint Sixtus know what they're doing. 962 charactersMore_betterness, Aug 07, 2014
4.52/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Reviewed from back log. 2001 vintage, shared by Preismj, thanks Matt!
Pours a deep purple with a bit of haze and no head to speak of. Nose is a raisin bomb with very complex notes in the aroma. Notes of vanilla, leather, dates, grapes, and candied fruit all come through with a hint of brown sugar in the background. Taste starts out with malty sweetness which comes off as being quite smooth. The sweetness is reminiscent of candied grapes with notes of caramel and a nice cinnamon raisin bread. Flavors are balanced beautifully, which I'm sure is in part due to the age of this beer. Mouthfeel is mellow and smooth. Overall, this beer was quite the treat, now I just need to give it a try fresh. 698 charactershomebrew311, Aug 07, 2014

Mouth: Bold, intense, rich. Coffee up front and a lot dark fruits and perfumy notes at the back. The finish is expressive and long, reminiscent of a Black Russian shot.
Overall: Myth status confirmed. This beer is pretty much near perfection for its style. 433 charactersendovelico, Aug 03, 2014

Stored at cellar temp since it arrived in the States in 2006. Last one; I drank the most recent in the spring of 2008. 330ml bottle poured into a Westvleteren chalice. Dark copper with a minimal but dense and persistent beige head. Head dissipates into a very swirly crown. Very hazy with pieces of sediment (unsurprising due to the age) floating around, despite my careful attempts to avoid pouring them.
Massive, complex bouquet. Huge alcohol and esters. Rum-like fusels with a ton of fruit flavors; cherry, plum, raisin, dark berries. Medicinal and slightly spicy phenols. Toffee, bready, and caramel malts and candi sugar. Molasses. Slightly nutty.
The flavor is just as ridiculously complex as the nose, but a little more subdued. Soft, sweet candi sugar combines with a ton of fruity esters. The cherries give it almost a little vinous flavor, but it combines with dates and raisins. The malts are big and sweet and indicating toffee and caramel(along with the candi sugar), but not even remotely close to cloying. Warmth from the alcohol brings about an excellent balance, and the yeasty esters and phenols give it a little bit of sharpness. 
Moderately carbonated; it may have dropped after six years in the bottle. Medium body, but it stands up to the alcohol and massive flavor profile. The alcohol gives it a more substantial feel and some warmth, but it is still fairly smooth.
For the first few years I was on this site, it was considered the Holy Grail beer. I have drank it before but never rated it, but this one is utterly phenomenal. Even if not the best beer in the world, it lives up to its hype. Apparently six years isn't too long to age it either. Absolutely wonderful and I hope I get the chance to drink another one of these again. 1,836 charactersPhocion, Jul 22, 2014

Nice hiss and carbon smoke on open.
Effervescent like champagne as it hits your tongue, then melts into figs, raisins, grapes, chocolate... no alcohol on it at all.
For a quad, this is superb, as expected.
**When I got this, I wasn't expecting it to live up to the hype. In all honesty, this surpassed all the hype and expectations. It's a fantastic beer. 367 charactersbbarclay, Jul 22, 2014

A bouquet of ripe dark fruits, brown sugar and Belgian yeasts.
Sipping this beer is an adventure. Lots of dark fruits, fig, raisin and plums with sweetness added from brown sugar and caramel. The Belgian yeasts really shine and are fantastically complimented.
Highly carbonated with a smooth creamy mouth feel. The alcohol leaves a nice warming feeling and becomes ever more present as it comes up to temperature.
The only downside is an empty glass. 550 charactersbyronic, Jul 09, 2014

Soft hiss crack. Poured out brown for the first half, then a sludgy dark brown accidentally slipped in. Poor decanting left a colony of yeast dredge on the foam top. The head looks excellent. Stays intact after a long time, like a blanket. The beer is a deep chestnut purple-brown. Classic Westy look.
Earthy brown bread maltiness, figgy fruits, phenols, Belgian chocolate, nutty yeast, prune, and dry light roast. Mild herbal character. No leftover booze to speak of. Some umami aromas included here. Hard to describe. Maybe stewed fruits.
Rich maltiness with brown bread and mild spiciness from phenols and moderate bitterness. Fig, raisin, nutty chocolate, clove, mild roast, medicinal notes, and candi sugar leftovers. Pleasantly, on the dry side. So much going on, and nothing that really dominates. A hearty brew with savory notes and an immense body of endless size and smoothness. So brothy in flavor and in feel. Nice bubble pop here and there in the mouth. Incredible feel. 1,048 charactersthecheapies, Jul 07, 2014

Quadruple 
10.2% ABV 
APPEARANCE: Pours a deep muddy opaque brown, with a frothy, rocky ecru colored head. Sheeting lacing that is dissipating the head rapidly as I watch bringing it down to a spotted thin halo. Very interesting to watch that. 
AROMA: Super bountiful bouquet, lots of plum, raisins, dates and brandy right away. Christmas spices hanging around with some sweet caramelized brown sugars that are ever present. 
TASTE: Complex flavors that change with every sip. Rich sweet dark deep fruits, cocoa layered with a malty sweetness. Some over ripe banana and those winter spices. There is a bit of hear from the alcohol but still nicely balanced. 
MOUTHFEEL: Full body with lazy low carbonation. Creamy and chewy that really expands in your mouth. Long sweet finish with a slight bit of bitterness. 
OVERALL: This was on my beer bucket list and it's hard not to be biased from all the hype. I do think it lived up to it though. I think it's a brilliant example of the style and I am really happy I got to try it. I don't feel like it's mind blowing and I can't say it's the best Belgian Quad in the world because I haven't had a lot to compare it to but on its own it really was a pretty amazing beer!

3.88/5  rDev -15.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Appearance: Dark brown, root beer color, with a tan head and nice lacing.
Aroma: Tart grapes, raisin, and butterscotch hard candy. 
Taste & Mouthfeel: Flavors of black liquorice, raisin, subtle Christmas spice, and horehound hard candy. It has a buttery/butterscotch flavor and texture overall, with mineral flavors through the nose. 
Final Word: For the price, I found this beer to be surprisingly straightforward and simple. The flavors were good (though the buttery characteristic could be a sign that my bottle wasn’t in peak shape), but they didn’t seem to mesh very well or stick around very long. I count myself lucky to have even gotten the chance to try a bottle, but find that I am completely unwilling to pay the steep price for another bottle. I’ve had plenty of beers with big price tags that were absolutely worth the price of entry, but I wouldn’t count this one among them. It simply lacked that euphoric “Wow!” that I’ve gotten from other top tier beers that I’ve tasted. When you pay $20+ for an 11.2oz. bottle, the reaction should never be indifference or disappointment. Again, I’ve found that very few reviewers of this beer include the butter/butterscotch flavor that I experienced in their profiles, which could point to my bottle being sub par due to shipping, temperature, or time, but at the same time I tasted what I tasted, and it was unfortunately disappointing given the price tag. This beer is far from bad, but it did not live up to its reputation as the best beer in the world, as the flavors weren’t full enough, and seemed to stand apart from each other instead of existing in harmony. If you get the chance to pick one up, it might be worth it just to say you’ve had it, but honestly I worry that this reasoning is what drives many people to buy it. Rarity doesn’t necessarily equal quality, and while this beer was still tasty, I found that Rochefort 10 not only gave it a run for its money, but was actually preferred by me. Check for freshness before you buy. 2,025 charactersLouisville-Beer-Reviews, Jun 21, 2014

O: First time to have this was Dec 19th, 2013. I Drank it in China with wife. Got a sixer at In De Verde. Surprised at the dryness, probably needs no ageing but will give ageing it a try. Great scent, tastes like an already aged beer.  Drank one again from this sixer with my brother in Canada in 2014, and now from the same batch May 6th, 2017.  It had a BBD of Oct 9th, 2016.  Tastes amazing today, after 3.5 years ageing, in Chiang Mai, Thailand where I now live. 852 characterspatre_tim, Jun 20, 2014

Appearance - chunky and bubbly! Obvious debris in the dark brown effervescence.
Smell - mild? Hard to recall.
Taste - Amazing. With the deep brown color, it is hard not to think of tootsie rolls.
Mouthfeel - sipping was delicious, didn't want to try quaffing. Coated my mouth with a long lasting taste I'd never had before.

Typical dark fruits associated with quadrupels are at play on the initial aroma. Dark plums, dates, candied fruits, and maybe figs is well supported by hints of spice, and bready Belgian yeast. A sweet wine like aftertaste also develops as the brew gets warmer. Perhaps more brandy than sweet wine.
I guess this is where the beer earns its hyped title. Lots of dark fruits, burnt sugar, cracked pepper, dates, and figs on the tongue at first. Molasses and a light licorice-like flavor takes over mid-tongue, leaving behind a subtly sweet candi sugar and cherry like flavor. Didn't occur to me the last two times I've tried this, but there is a very subtle muted hop flavor that resides in the back burner.
Nice dry, bitter finish, full-bodied with a pleasant amount of carbonation. 838 charactersamano_h, Jun 08, 2014

4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- opaque, muddy brown. Coarse tan head, nice retention. Lacing is present in sheets for a moment, but then snap! It breaks quickly and leaves random patches of foam that sink slowly into the beer. Only a thin ring is left as a reminder of the lacing that was. Nice to watch.
S- woah, really broad range of aromas. Sweet brandy first off. Very vinous and oaky. Sweet grapes, tobacco, dried plums, yeasty dough. Oh man, what is this? It smells like it was pressed from the forbidden fruit. The alcohol is definitely enhanced as it warms.
T- just like the aroma, a sweet grape/alcohol/amazing experience. Bread and alcohol. Reminds me of fruitcake around the holidays, and thats a good thing. Lots of dried plums and other assorted candied fruits all come together under one harmonious cover of spice. Clove and cinnamon all around. I get a hint of licorice as well. That Belgian yeast is a wonderful colony of Single-celled organisms.
M- medium bodied, aggressive carbonation. It is reminiscent of champagne, but definitely more viscous. It's syrupy, but the carbonation thins it out considerably.
O- I had this beer a while back, and I wasn't impressed. Now, I don't know what I was thinking. Seriously, it's amazing. 1,221 characterssilverking, May 28, 2014

Pours a dark, murky brown with red highlights, almost a plum shade. Creamy two-finger off-white head with poor retention. No lacing to speak of.
In the nose, an intoxicating blend of Christmas-y spices, burnt brown sugar, caramel malt, plums, prunes, raisins, and brandy. Subtle red wine tannins.
In the mouth, plum, prune, raisin, and fig notes mingle impressively with notes of brandy, caramel malt, caramelized brown sugar, molasses, clove, and cinnamon. Faint cocoa powder. Subtly yeasty in the finish, with a hint of boozy heat creeping in.
Mouthfeel is creamy but fairly dry, with an effervescent carbonation keeping the beer from feeling too sticky or heavy. Alcohol is noticeable, particularly towards the back, but merely contributes an entirely appropriate-feeling warming characteristic.
On the whole, this is a monumental beer and without a doubt the best quad I've ever had. That said...Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus Abt 12 give Westvleteren XII a real run for its money--and factoring in accessibility, it's hardly even a contest. All that said, this is still a spectacular beer, and one well worth hunting down. 1,193 charactersLjudsignal, May 24, 2014

Poured from the virtually unmarked bottle into a tulip glass. Formed a thin off-white head over the dark plum colored beer. SO many aromas from this beer... dried fruit, malt, molasses, etc. The flavors are surprisingly smooth with almost no off taste from the high ABV. This was a sweet, sweet brew that I could not believe was so high gravity. I could imagine sitting at the abbey and drinking these all day long... but that would probably be a bad plan! 530 charactersDawgboned37, May 20, 2014

O - Amazing, though Rochefort 10 may give it a run for its money. Its exclusive nature might be propagating perceptions on how great it is, though it is great. 432 charactersWantonFaun, May 09, 2014

S: Sweet, juicy dark dried fruits, Italian plums, black cherry, musky black grape and black figs mixed with spices of cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Entirely sweet with brown sugar and caramel malts, similar to a slow baked and deeply dark christmas fruit cake. The alcohol notes of brandy offer a base note to support the sweetness and fruitiness while a subtle yeastiness is barely detectable in the background. 
T: Bold and assertive the flavours are sweet and spicy, while offering unpinnings of woody earthiness and rum alcohol. The sweet notes come forward first with brown sugar and pales malts steeped with the sweet spices of cloves, cinnamon, all spice and nutmeg. Mid palette the belgian yeasts shine through, although recognizable as yeasts - this is unlike other quads and offers a distinct & unique flavour profile that tastes especially of ripe bananas and warm bread. Mid palette also reveals a woody earthiness and worn leather - suggestive some something old world and calling back to a old tradition of crafting. On the back end of the palette the flavours are of rum and alcohol esters - warming and delightful. 
M: Slick and smooth in the front with a warm and smooth alcohol chaser at the back. 
Slightly higher carbonation than other quads with pin pricks up front. Like a tiny jolt to waken the palette. 
O: Unlike any other quads, Westy is unabashed in its bold approach to the complexity and mix of sweet, spices, yeasts, earthiness and alcohol presence. It's complexity is worth the price point and effort to search it out. The drink is worth sharing with another BA who'll enjoy and appreciate the experience & appreciate the complexity compared to quads. Good to note - Westy pairs incredibly well with strong cheese, dried fruit and a good BA buddy, do yourself a favour and get one to enjoy and savour. 2,040 charactersFondueVoodoo, Apr 21, 2014

A: Beautiful quad color, dark caramel, with a red tinge to it. Perfect lacing, pours an off-white finger head. 
S: Smells faintly like a glass of red wine. Has a very fruity aroma like prunes and raisins.
T: Tastes just like it smells. Strong dark fruit aromas. Tastes like a solid quad.
M: Very, very carbonated. Almost too carbonated. I feel like the carbonation robbed some of the more subtle flavors from me. Fairly sticky, but overall decent.
O: Flavors are all there, the smell and appearance make this beer worth the wait. Mouthfeel was a slight letdown for me. Try it if you haven’t, but don’t go and invest in a six pack because you might be slightly underwhelmed. 728 charactersViperman1316, Apr 20, 2014

A - A deep tobacco brown. Lots of floating sediment. Big cream head leaving some lacing.
S - One of the best smelling beers I have ever had. It was very hard to discern aromas because there were so many. Unlike anything I had ever smelled before. Dark fruits, brown sugar, caramel were what I smelled the most.
T - Didn't taste much that much like the smell, but like something entirely wonderful that I wasn't expecting. A tinge of heat from the booze but so many married flavors in there make the beer go down way too fast. I almost need to drink 2 or 3 more to pick it all out. Prunes, plums, yeast, raisins, brown sugar were what I was able to pick out.
M - Good carbonation, which I expected. Wasn't expecting that much sediment, but it never bothered me a bit. Creamy but not too thick.
O - A bucket list beer. It's like art. I was truly fortunate to have the opportunity to try one. It's magic. Would pay an $ amount for another bottle that my wife would never agree to. 1,149 charactersBrewsforBreakfast, Apr 19, 2014

It's surprising how crisp and prominent the fruit notes are. The taste is actually a solid reflection of the smell. Lively carbonation tickles the mouth while the dark fruit flavors, with a touch of blackberry, intermingle over a gentle bready background. The nose is beautiful yet somewhat understated, while the taste is bold and lively. It combines for one of the best beers I've ever had.

Pours a hazy chestnut, lots of sediment, with a thick, off-white head that diminishes to a frothy cap that remained throughout. The aroma is full of dark fruits, brown sugar, malt, and warm spices. On the palate there's the dark fruit, but unlike the aroma, these are reminiscent of holiday fruit-cake dark fruits - sweet, but not cloyingly so. Nice bready malt with hints of clove. The 10% ABV adds a nice warming feeling but doesn't overwhelm. Velvety, medium bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall, this is a very complex and well crafted quad. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but hunting this down is hardly worth the effort with so many other readily available outstanding quads, especially Rochefort and St. Bernardus. 777 charactersJohnG190, Apr 12, 2014

Appearance: Pours a hazy iced-tea brown, with plenty of sediment, and leaves a big two-fingered spritzy head which fades quickly to a layer atop the beer. The bottle gushed a bit upon opening.
Smell: Dark fruits (plums, raisins, figs) come out first along with big malts, spices, cloves, brown sugar, hint of banana, hint of alcohol.
Taste: Very interesting. Much different from the aroma. Alcohol soaked raisins and figs, malts, cloves, mixed nuts, molasses, maple candy, belgian yeast, brandy. Boy, this is complex.
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a thick, yet slightly choppy mouthfeel. Hard to explain. Definitely the thickest quad I've tasted.
Overall: Truly a unique beer. Very interesting sweet flavors and a milder yet still somewhat sweet aroma. Definitely worth trying. I'd drink again if I found the opportunity - a great experience. 1,000 charactersResuin, Apr 11, 2014
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from GBBF 2013. Well done to the international bar for sourcing these. Drunk on Bank Holiday Monday August 26th 2013. First sniff from the bottle and this is surprisingly beery and malt grainy. Not the overpowering hit of alcoholic complexity I was expecting. Pours dark reddish brown, with some nice reddish clarity in the glass. Thin off white bubbly head. First full on aroma is very malty. Caramel, ripe fruit, particularly a banana estery aroma, dark rye bread. Lots of banana and caramel, ripe plums. Taste is tangy and estery, but surprisingly quaffable and drinkable. It’s caramel, banana estery, some light dark fruit, plums and a bit of brandy or cognac alcoholic kick on the finish, with some of that black rye bread. Texture is medium, not heavy really, and it’s quite sticky and sweet. It’s less complex and heavy than Rochefort 10, but way more drinkable IMHO. I really like it. Could knock one of these back every day. 17.01.14 - comparison with St. Bernardus Abt 12. The Westy is definitely maltier and dryer compared to the fruit of the St. B. and the Westy 12 has a beautiful malty banana nose, which out-rates the St B. The Westy 12 although more subtle does have a bigger alcoholic kick than the St B though. 1,241 charactersEdKing, Apr 10, 2014

The ABV is completely hidden which makes this incredible treat that much more drinkable. The carbonation was crisp and the aroma was magnificent. This beats the Roc 10, ABT 12, Pannepot and any other brew I have ever had that even remotely resembles this beer. Just a flat out masterpiece! At one time I argued that ABT 12 was the same beer as history has recorded, well I was wrong its not. I have a good quantity of this brew and its hard for me to age it as I want to drink it all.
Bottom Line: Legendary beer that lives above the hype! 654 charactersthemind, Apr 09, 2014

S - Out of this world. Booze soaked raisins, currants and dark fruits. Honey like sweetness plays with a burnt candied sugar and a welcomed boozy nose. 
T - This beer follows the nose with that booze soaked fruitiness as a support to the sweetness of honey and burnt candy sugar. Finish is semi dry, slightly boozy and a touch of fruity sweetness and anise on the finish. 
M - Creamy and coating, which I wasn't expecting but loved. Finish is semi dry and sweet.

Served chilled in a Orval goblet (for lack of a Sint Sixtus glass). The beer pours a clear brown color with ruddy highlights. The head that develops has a dense, creamy consistency and rises gently to form an ochre pillow that rises above the glass rim. As the head settles, it coats the glass in a solid sheet of Brussels lace. I decided to serve this with the lees.
A powerful aroma stirs as the beer is being poured. It is immediately reminiscent of a dark wishniak cola. Notes of raisins, red wine, and earthy hops emerge as it warms. 
On the palate, the 12 has a very smooth, full body, with abundant carbonation, but not effervescent. The creamy finish carries a slight hint of this beer's strength, with only a pinprick of heat and warmth. The flavor is rich and bursting with cola, cherry, fig jam, and dried dark fruits in the finish. There is such a beautiful demure approach to this beer that has such a high alcohol content. It is bold, yet graceful.
I did not let this singular opportunity go by without attempting to pair it with some delicious French bleu cheese: Bleu d'Auvergne l'Or des Domes...stemmed from Roquefort if I am not mistaken, this cow's milk bleu is extremely creamy (like the beer) and is well-balanced and somewhat soft-spoken as well for a bleu cheese. A taste of this supple cheese, and the oils are released on the tongue, coating the palate. Guess what lifts those oils right off? That's right, the 12 just reacts on the tongue, bubbling up and contrasting against the lightly salty quality of the Auvergne cheese. The rich flavors of the beer stand up so well against this hearty cheese. My only wish is that I had a French-made baguette to tag along with this feast for the senses.
I am stunned by this beer. It is most definitely the best in the style that I have tasted, and the thing that continues to impress the the subtlety mixed with the strength and power of this beer. Well-balanced, full-bodied, powerful aroma and rich flavors, yet gentle on the palate, smooth, fine, and would age more than gracefully. This is a beer that deserves all the praise and were I more local, I would make the reservation necessary to buy a whole case of this. 2,268 charactersMusicaleMike, Apr 03, 2014

I opened it today at cellar temp (about 62F). 
The color was a brow with some ruby, just a light lacing after a few seconds of head. Really small sets of bubbles.
Aroma: there's a lot coming off, although due to the temp at which I drank it, there's a large alcohol smell, but, it's pretty well balanced against some raisin, caramel, and some sort of "bread" from the malt.
Taste: great mouthfeel, low carbonation, leaving a smooth and viscous body. Sweet malt, caramel, alcohol, and vanilla. The warming of the alcohol was complimented by the malt and sweetness and the yeast flavors....
Really: it's an amazing beer. I'll bring the temp down on the next one just a hair, I'll bet that at 50ish they're perfect. 799 characterstimfc, Mar 30, 2014

4.69/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Here it is, the traditional holy mother of the beer kingdom. The fair lady was kind enough to track down a bottle (cap-stamped with 20.12.16) of this for the anniversary of the day I was born, so for such an occasion we crack right into it on a fresh, rested palate. We pour a brew of rich ruby-mahogany into our oversized tasting snifters. It immediately jets up two fingers worth of tight latte colored foam that doesn’t quit. This retains excellently, sifting down and sitting atop the liquid in an eventual creamy, ephemeral film. Thick corded ridges and archipelagos of lacing are left around the glasses. No real haze is noted, but tiny flecks of sediment sit suspended throughout. Carbonation appears to be moderate yet pervasive. The aroma takes you by surprise, with massively sweet booziness and vanilla bean off the bat. These settle as the beer warms, allowing room for the remaining mix of heavy caramel, brown, and burnt wheaty malts, straw, musk, cherry and fig syrups, dried dates, almond oil, melty candied toffies, plum and concord grape fruitiness, dirty dried grass and petal, savory Belgian yeasty steel, smoked tobacco leafiness, perfumed booziness, match head sulfurics, buttercream frosting, peanut butter nuttiness, and gentle buttery diacetyls, to flower through. Our first impression is that the flavoring is almost drowned out by the mouthfeel, which is intensely creamy and thick. As we sip, the taste begins with the bite of fusel booze, brightly sweet caramel and brown maltiness with a buttery brush, wood lacquer, black pepper, astringent plum skins, dried figs and raisins, vanilla and almond extract, and that aromatic, dusty Belgian yeast. The middle peaks with a sweeter cloy of malty fruitiness, with caramel and toffee biscuits, strawberry, pear, and date syrups, chewy burnt granola, wheat flour, toasty walnuts, cooked brown, wheaty, and crystal maltiness, granular white sugar sweetness, and dried cedar lick. Washing through the end is a cleansing bitterness of booze, light cloven phenols, the softest banana esters, licorice, burnt leathers, cereal and caramel grain, continued grapey fruitiness, salted yeastiness, toasty almonds, mild oaky woodiness, vanilla extract, cigar smokiness. The aftertaste breathes of walnut oils, dates and golden raisins, lint and dust, phenolic plastics, tinny and brassy metallics, rum-soaked pound cake, bile acidity, sea salt, heavy alcohols, basement mustiness, bitter booziness, light bourbon-corn essence, continued gentle smoked peatiness, and the final echoes of that warming European yeastiness. The body is thick and chewy, and the carbonation is medium. Slurp, smack, cream, froth, pop, glug, foam, and drag are all intense, complete, and wonderful. The mouth is thickly coated, but dried overtop with a quickly burning layer of thin alcohol that leaves the mouth somewhere between satiated and astringently puckered with chalkiness. The abv is appropriate, and although it drinks back well, you find the desire to want to make it last strong.
Overall, the best thing about this beer is how it handles your expectations of it. You go into it expecting this insane, flavor-bomb of power that will forever change your views and opinions of beers. You don’t really get that. The real magic of this beer is in just how simple and clean the execution of it is. The balance is unsullied, with the booze and the malt bill meeting for a beautiful dance in the center of the room. They just take their recipe and should you how it’s done, without the need for any bells, whistles, or unnecessary flair or novelty. This beer is all about harmony, and doing the right thing at the right time. The nose and the flavoring both embody this mantra naturally and intrinsically, so it comes as an even bigger surprise when the mouthfeel comes crashing in unfettered. It is so thick and creamy, creeping along like molten lava, acting like the perfect delivery vessel for the bold cleanliness of flavoring. This is an exercise is technique, and although some may be disappointed by the flavoring alone not taking them into the clouds, one must sit back and appreciate the art of the craft and what it means to strive for brewing perfection. Hard to track down, but well worth it if you want to taste what a fantastic beer is made from. 4,312 charactersTheBrewo, Mar 26, 2014

4.92/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Finally got my hands of Westy XII. Best before 16.11.14 on the cap.
Dark brown in color, with some copper notes. Not a huge beige head, but sticks around for a long time. You can hear a lot of aggressive carbonation at first, but it seems to settle rather fast.
Rich smell, with dark malts, raisin, brown sugar, figs, red grapes (with a musty component, enhanced by the subtle alcohol), nuts and faint dark spices. Don't expect a strong smell that you get from popping the bottle, you have to give this one a big close sniff, but the elements are really well balanced.
Taste knocks it out of the park. Wow. Toffee and caramel, with a nice citrus feel right on its tail, but also juicy cherries, berries, plums, grapes (strong alcohol makes it feel like a sherry or a brandy). Malts are pretty quiet, way in the back, but with a decent enough roastiness and a rich taste of multi-cereal bread (ryebread maybe?). Spicy, hints of vanilla, anise, faint nutmeg and cinnamon. Mildly bitter finish with some hops peaking through.
Full body, low carbonation. There's a big complexity here, starting off crisp, then sweet, alcohol tends to dry the mouth a bit afterwards, then there's a roasted bitterness... it's really a lot going on. Malts linger in the aftertaste, would have enjoyed some fruitiness to stick around too. Not boozy.
I'm gonna stop now and just enjoy this perfect beer. Yes, "perfect" should suffice. 1,410 charactersdcmchew, Mar 24, 2014

This is great fresh and with some age on it. I have one that is now three years old and will be opening later this year.
Poured with almost a 2 finger head into a Westy glass. 
Smell is that of a Belgian Quad with a little bit less sweetness to it and a little bit more spice. 
Both taste and mouthfeel live up to the hype. Little bit more spice to go with the fruits and sugars. Taste opens up more as it warms up. 653 charactersshnsajax, Mar 06, 2014

Bottle cap is dated: 10.11.14
Very large snappy, soapy, tan colored head. poor retention. Brew is deep red with lots of brown. Good clarity too. No lacing. Thin.
Tons of smooth clove, lots of spice, but not over the top. Heavenly smooth butter cream on the nose. Not sugary. I could Sniff this for quite sometime... Great raisins. Very-very mild "Belgian Banana". 
Nearly distracting amount of carbonation. Large amount of bubbles. Great fluidity and heavenly drinkability. Slightly lighter and thinner than I had imagined it would be. SLIGHT rubber aftertaste on the very tail end. Sweetness is light, crisp, airy, and solid. I would prefer a bit more body and a little less fluid. Cloves are strong robust, crisp, airy. Not a banana bomb... Nice smooth dry bitter finish. 
IMO, this beer delivered the hype; it's one of the few. It's not mind altering, but very solid and well rounded. *Nearly* perfect for the style. I would have enjoyed a bit stronger appearance, more forward flavoring, thicker body, and more creamy head. Definitely recommended. 1,062 characterschugalug06, Mar 04, 2014

smell is not strong, but there does seem to be some dark fruit aroma. otherwise nothing to smell(?).
taste catches my attention right away. dark fruit. alcohol. plums. fig. malt. toffee.
2nd pour yields a more level, creamy head.
what's missing in this (and preferably) is the rich Belgian yeast that is so prevalent in most all the Belgian brews. even the St. Bernardus has ample amounts of the rich yeasty flavor which I grew to love and then over indulge in to the point of staying away from the Belgians for quite a while. but this does not have that overpowering yeast and richness.
slathering it down the back of my throat I can taste the toffee and malt and syrup qualities. this is genuinely an incredible brew. I try not to let the rarity of it influence my perception but I am very enamored with this, and the other two (8 and blonde) I have tried. the alcohol burn is not an unpleasant one. it actually is very smooth and delicious.
I gave this excellent ratings. only the smell is lower due to the fact I cannot smell much, but that alone is also a great quality-nothing overpowering, ya know? I realize I gave the st. bernardus a higher rating but that was back when I was less refined and experienced and I was blown away with the beer. I haven't had a st bernardus in a while, and maybe it's time to try one (maybe side by side with the west12?) but from memory, this is a smoother, more stable, taste and I really think this is better in my opinion. 1,635 characterspkalix, Mar 02, 2014

Appearance - OK so I might have fudged the number on the appearance a little but I feel that it is justified because some of the other rating scores need to be higher than a 5. It is a beautiful, full rich, ruby, mocha, milk, chocolate color. If I was to knock the beer in any way, it is that the color wasn't as vibrant as I had hoped. (I guess I had hoped that the beer would somehow glow or something.) 
Smell - What got me here is how "full" the smell was. It's not pungent like a hop bomb but it seemed that my entire nose and respiratory system was consumed by the, again, "fullness" of the smell. I could list off the individual smells but everyone else has already listed those. Here is an area where the scores need to be higher that a 5. 
Taste - oh... my... god... yes, it's good. Again, I could list the individual flavors that I'm picking up but that's only a teeny tiny portion of what's going on here. What's great about Westy 12 is how the flavors develop and intermingle with each other. So smooth and subtle yet sophisticated and refined all at the same time. By far - beyond thunderdome - holy crap in a dumptruck - this is by far the best tasting beer I've ever had. Seriously. LISTEN TO ME!!! It's good.
Mouthfeel - Perfect. 'Nuf said.
So far, this is the only beer I've ever had that I thought deserved all 5's. And to be honest, I'd like to give it even higher scores. I'm not usually one to fall prey to hype but this one lives up to it and possibly surpasses it. This is a serious mastery of the perfection of the brewing art. Now, is it the best beer on the planet? I can't say for sure because I haven't had them all and I doubt that anyone else has either. But, is it the best beer I've ever had? Yeah. Abso-friggin-lutely!! 1,943 characterslivewire78, Feb 20, 2014

A- Caramelized brown color, golden and ruby hues. Massive and durable mocha-tan colored head that has a scoop of mass in the center. Just translucent enough to see the abundant micro-carbonation and slight bit of sediment. Hearty foam lacing.
S-Rich malts, sweet and sour dark fruit. Not boozy, but the alcohol provides enhancement and muskiness to the aroma. There's some Eastern-European baking influenced aroma as well, sweet and dark raisin bread. It gets better as it warms.
T- Once again, hearty malts with dark fruit. Raisin in particular. Just enough sugars for sweetness without being a sugar bomb. Tastes of anise, coffee, spice, and tobacco bounce around.
M- So full and sturdy, yet incredibly smooth. It makes me think of cooking roux as a base, thick rather than water based. Nice tingle of carbonation in each sip. Some alcohol bite. Lasting sweet finish. 
O- All the hype and more. Drinkable at 10.2% abv. Maybe too drinkable. 1,005 charactersNiceTaps, Feb 16, 2014

Dark brown color with huge fluffy tan head which dissipated very slowly into a persistent tan collar. Excellent sticky and consistent lacing throughout. On the nose, molasses and wet leather scents dominate, with hints of sour apricots and cherries. On the palate, the sweetness of molasses and smoky leather dance between notes of dried apricots, peaches, and cherries. The malt asserts itself, amidst ample hoppiness, and the burn of spicy alcohol becomes evident. The mouthfeel is punishingly full and chewy, demanding the respect this monster deserves.
I am generally not a big fan of Belguan ales, but this behemoth lives up to the hype. Glad I made the reach for this one. 720 charactersJohnParadee, Feb 10, 2014

A - Hazy pecan brown with a massive creamy head that takes awhile to settle.
S - Brown sugar, dark Belgian candy, spicy yeast, mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, leather, tobacco, plumbs, dates, bananas, cherries, walnuts. The yeast become more raw and bready as it warms. Awesome aroma.
T - Dark Belgian candy jumps out long with Belgian yeast, bananas, nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, cherries, tobacco, some hop bitterness is present, the alcohol is present and adds a spicy kick on the palate. The malt is sweet and caramelized but has a rawness that you don't get with alot of ales. There's an earthy and rustic character makes that adds an edginess. The finish is very dry with dry spices and a kiss of rummy alcohol. 
M - Moderate carbonation, medium/full body, thins out as it warms. 
Glad I got to try this. I've done a blind taste test with this and 2 other highly acclaimed quads and this did well. It's not as fruity as other quads and has a more rustic character. This taste like a true trappist ale. 1,053 charactersStaveHooks, Feb 08, 2014

Dark, even for a quad. Definitely says there's something of substance in the glass. Very nice dark head. My nose was a bit frozen (it was January in Brussels...) but still picked up a nice fruity, nutty smell. Taste was amaaaazing. Smooth, perfectly balanced. No bitterness, offensive funk or alcohol taste. 
I can't say "best in the world" because I haven't had them all yet. But definitely, the best I've ever had. 618 charactersRCane1, Feb 01, 2014

Among the 12 brews tasted was; Westvleteren XII Quadrupel. We did a direct comparison tasting of the Westvleteren XII against the Rochefort 10. The Rochefort 10 was chosen the better 3 to 1, and tied for 4th highest average score of the 12 brews tasted at 4.25. Smoothness being the deciding factor between the the Rochefort 10 and the Westvleteren XII. The Westvleteren XII came in 9th of the 12 brews tasted with an average score of at 3.81. 537 charactersricknelson, Jan 27, 2014

4.57/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Lots of dark brown yeast; a careful pour can keep most in the bottle. Even then, there's a ton of sediment in the brew. Topped by an off-white, cream-colored head of fairly small size (~3/4 finger). Excellent retention and lacing.
Boozy, strong aroma typical of a quad: yeast, Candi, dark fruit, nuts. Brown sugar. Alcoholic fruit bread. Dark bread is definitely the strongest takeaway. No hint of oxidation. Remarkably complex.
Flavor follows the aroma, maintaining a nice sweetness, but not out of character for the style. Lots of dark, thick bread; a bit of bite; tons of dark fruit (plum, prune, raisin); liquorice and brown sugar; nuts.
Feel is full-bodied, smooth, and lively, with no sting and minor foaming. Fairly wet, medium length finish, with a lingering sweetness and a bit of alcohol effervescence. Though it's definitely a sipper, it's incredibly drinkable for such a big beer.
This is an absolutely fantastic, nearly perfect quad. My personal favorite in the style is Rochefort 10, but that's mostly preference over any distinct difference in quality. 1,071 charactersRoguer, Jan 27, 2014

S: Hard to describe. Definitely some dark fruit, malt, orange, Belgian yeast and spices in the nose.
T: Starts off a touch citric, but once it spreads across the tongue you get sweet, rummy candied fruits, raisin, dark fruit, malt, with a lingering malty sweet dark fruit finish.
M: Full bodied and smooth. Alcohol warms as it goes down.
O: Is this the best beer of all time? No. It's not my favorite quad. It is an excellent beer. I had been told it lived up to the hype, but 97 is the the highest I've given to a belgian ale, and this, St. Bernardus & Rochefort 10 all got 97s from me. 648 charactersBierJager89, Jan 05, 2014

Appearance: Deep, dark brown (more of a dark copper). Creamy head that dissipates quickly. No Lacing.
Aroma: Apples, Brandy, Nutmeg, Fusel Alcohol, Pears, and Toffee.
Taste: Toffee and dried fruit, brandy and green apples. Figs and plums. Caramel and raisins. Booze, but just the right amount.
Feel: Thick, but not overly heavy or chewy. Slightly acidic feel with low carbonation. Can sip on this for days and wish it doesn't end.
Overall: A unique and wonderful beer. Very nice quad. The complexity is unreal. It almost transcends beer. Very good. Malheur 12 used to be my favorite, but no longer. 684 charactersmxchap, Jan 05, 2014

4.6/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Was able to get my hands on this beer of legends thanks to the kindness of a trade with fellow BA Stevedore. Enjoyed out of the classic label-less 330 mL label-less brown bottle with the embossed ring around the neck and nothing but a cap to denote its origin. Cap is marked clearly with an enjoy by date of April 25th, 2016. Poured into a large brandy snifter.
Appearance - Gentle pour yields an effervescent khaki head of champagne-like bubbles about a finger and a half thick. Beneath the head lies a dark brown body that obscures the light, but when held up in front of a light source reveals a hue of ruddy maroon, like clay. With about an inch of liquid left in the bottle, the liquid coming out of the bottle turns from a light caramel brown to a cloudier tone from the sediment. The head dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a thick rim of foam around the edge of the glass, with a thin film of bubbles across about half of the surface, with a smattering of thicker bubbles in the middle. Lacing is sparse, but when I tilt the glass to look at the color, it leaves some nice legs that cling to the glass for quite awhile before slinking back down into the glass.
Smell - I could probably sit here and sniff at this one for awhile. Each new inhalation reveals slightly new aroma profiles. Initially, I got some faint astringency and booziness, but began to detect notes of vanilla, brown sugar, nutmeg, dark fruits--mostly raisin at this juncture. There is also a pleasant floral element to the smell, imparting a gentleness that I don't tend to expect from such a high ABV beer. Soft hints of alcoholic esters dance throughout, but don't overpower the more subtle notes.
Taste - Picking up where the hauntingly delicate aroma left off, the flavor is a bit more aggressive, but only by comparison to the aroma. It's far from a mouth-punch, but it does contain complexity upon complexity. Caramel malt, some faint roasty bitterness, plum, black currant, fig, vanilla, anise. Some spiciness that reminds me of rye as well, though I doubt there is any of that grain in this beer. Mind you, it's taking me sip upon sip--much like with the aroma--to get all these notes. One sip, the fig and vanilla will hit me, and on the next one, it's the considerable presence of the esters that punch through. Doing my best to let it warm up to capture every single bit of the massive amount of depth contained therein. In many ways, it reminds me of a fine brandy, but a little more earthy.
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied, but lighter than I expected. Not sure where that expectation came from, but there you have it. Carbonation is moderate. Honestly, the thinness of the feel is the first major qualm I have with this beer.
Overall, a beer that surely lives up to the massive reputation that precedes it. I think my favorite aspect is the wonderfully complex, but admittedly subdued, aroma, but there truly isn't a negative component to this beer. Now to get my hands on some of the 8 and Blonde... 2,990 charactersLambicPentameter, Dec 26, 2013

I'm glad to report there was nothing about this beer that fell short.
Snifter Glass at about 55 degree beer temp.
Appearance: A reddish purple hue and a tad bit cloudy. Nice head that stays around for the duration of the beer.
Smell; Raisins, plums, figs and some what yeasty.
Taste: Refer to smell yet with some complexity on the back end of the tongue. So much depth.
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is retained and provides a great feel not over powering. Alcohol content is very well hidden.
Overall: It lives up to the hype and I'm so glad I had a chance to partake. It's a must try. 754 charactersYoudownwithABV, Dec 26, 2013
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A: Pour has a murky amber, dark brown presence. Head is thick, off-white, and about a ½ an inch-inch high, with great retention and lacing.
S: Aroma is quite sophisticated with the presence of Belgian yeast, toffee, dark fruit (raisins, plum, grapes), brown sugar, nougat, and slight caramel.
T: Being no disappointment after the aroma, taste is creamy, sweet, complex, and nicely carbonated. Correspondingly, notes follow along the same path as the aroma: yeast, malty, brown sugar, plums, caramel, vanilla, toffee, and dark fruit. 
M: Mouthfeel is medium to heavy on carbonation and body; a heavier emphasis on medium accompanied by a nice wine like feel.
O: The complexity and the creamy/sweet feel here are outstanding: slight hop bitterness, raisins, figs, prunes, cherries, grapes…. 795 charactersM-Fox24, Dec 25, 2013

4.76/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Two-year old bottle. Dark brown but not quite opaque. Excellent head formation and retention, while lacing is there but sparse. Rich, dark, sweet but not too sweet aroma. Rum-soaked dark fruits - plum and raisin. Very rich and malty with just a touch of alcohol.
Robustly malty-sweet flavor, while the sweetness is well-attenuated. Ripe dark fruit leads the way, plum, raisin, and currant, candi sugar backing it up. Very faint hop bitterness to balance things out a bit. Carbonation has been nicely tamed, providing for a soft mouthfeel with minimal harshness. Finishes a touch drier with a bit of lingering candi sugar and alcohol.
The well-balanced sweetness puts this at the top of the quads for me. So rich and complex, showcasing great complexity. 755 charactersgr0g, Dec 25, 2013

both pour a dark brown with a slight head. the smell of the belgian one is less fruity than the american one... both have a lot of dark fruits tho. the taste is the opposite, the belgian release is a tad more complex and fruity than the USA release...but both are extremely close. full bodied with medium carbonation. smell the edge goes to USA release taste to Belgian. But close.
overall its a good quad but not outstanding. not sure how this is world class... 520 charactersAxnjxn, Dec 19, 2013

A- One inch off-white head recedes quickly to a cap and thick collar throughout. Deep ruby red body color with light purple hues around the edges. Splotchy lacing. 
S- Major raisins, prunes, grapes, dark fruits aplenty. Slight hint of oxidation but it works well with the Westy 12.
T- More with the raisins but finishes with a taste of cherries. Well balanced hop profile to malts but yeast dominates as it should. Dangerously drinkable for 10.2%abv.
M- Medium mouthfeel. Medium-low carbonation fits great to the overall profile of the beer.
D/O- The Westvleteren XII excels in every aspect of it's attributes. A complete beer if their ever was such a thing. Highly recommended for any Belgian beer fan. A thank you to digita7693 many moons ago for the LIF send out. Happy college graduation to me :) 818 charactersDuff27, Dec 13, 2013

I’m writing this one up for my 1,000th review. (I don’t count my “hads” against my total.)
I had the opportunity to share this one at an epic bottle share. I’ll take it! As my first beer of the session I received a hearty pour, relatively speaking, and I knew it would be my one chance to try it. 29.11.15 on cap.
The Westy pours with this deep amber-raisiny pureed color. There’s an amazing aroma—it’s exactly what I want and everything I’d expect, only layered like a filing cabinet of sensory delights. Raisin and fig and a bready ester which warms, revealing notes of rum and brown sugar. 
Yes, there’s hype. Yes, it’s rare (-ish, post 2012). Certainly all that factors, consciously or not, into my experience. All that aside, my god was it good. 807 characterselNopalero, Dec 11, 2013

My old balls still remember when this beer traded highly, never saw stateside distribution, and was ranked the top beer on this site. Bout time to get around to drinking and reviewing I guess. Cap reads 16.02.13 which makes this an 08 if my cap translation is up to par. 
Pours a rusty brown with some spotted bubbles. Looks like mud- butt toilet water to be honest.
Smells of yeasty prunes with a splash of almond.
Taste is watery raisin juice and a touch of almond bark and cherry thrown on top. Feel is watered down and thin. What the hell is going on here?
Maybe I'm on hidden camera...in fact, I hope so. Maybe I'd chuckle and wag my finger at the scalawag who expertly placed their bullshit attempt at a quad in this bottle and expertly recapped it. If I'm not being tricked, then I'm a healthy mix of bewilder-pissed. Not since watching The Happening and feeling a palpable loss of all respect for M. Night have I been this bewildered. Prankster Monk possibility aside, this is one "world class" beer that's hitting my fucking drain. 1,127 charactersBarrytheBear, Dec 05, 2013

Smell: Dark fruit, raisins, little banana. Deep sweet malt; brown, burnt sugar. There is some very subtle smokey, roast notes, hint of coffee (more like cappuccino). There is also some sour and (hm) "bitter" tone. Superb balance, yet subtle and complex.
Taste: Dark fruits again, little spike from high alcohol. Very smooth, creamy, caramel, toffee and cappuccino middle malts. Little brandy notes but not overwhelming. There is also some very subtle funk. Ends with a very good mix of sour and malty aftertaste. Perfect. Last sips with some yeast, nice finish. 
Mouthfeel: Starts a little spicy then very smooth, full. It is slightly warming doe to the high alcohol but goes away after a few sips. Alcohol very well hidden. Surprisingly good and lively carbonation. Leaves a nice creamy feeling. 
Overall: Was skeptical with all the hype, but it delivered. Balanced, subtle and very complex. Definitely a must try. 1,057 characterstmzl, Dec 03, 2013

As a present for passing my final accounting exam, my mom took me out for lunch and purchased a beer (any beer) of my choosing. With the knowledge that this location actually had Westy 12, I decided the time was right.
Unfortunately served quite cold into a dainty Westvleteren glass. I waited at least 20 minutes before sipping on it, but i'm not 100% sure that was enough time.
Appearance - Hazy dark brown color, with some reddish / purple hues. Not much in the way of head, but looks rich and inviting. Tons of bits of sediment dispersed throughout the glass.
Smell - a deep inhale yielded tons of funky Belgian yeasts and some bready notes. As the beer warmed there was some butterscotch and caramel with quite a few hints of other aromas that my nose was unable to identify. Smells delicious especially as the beer warms.
Taste - Very complex, some bitterness from a deep earthy taste but also some sweetness from dark fruits and especially figs. Spiciness comes out a bit more as the beer warms and the butterscotch and caramel do too. There is bready flavors throughout. Quite delicious, but this is a beer that really does need to be served rather warm. (12-18 degrees Celsius).
Mouthfeel - Rather crazy carbonation throughout, tons of tiny bubbles fizzing over your tongue. Some mild boozy heat in the back of the throat. You realize the alcohol is there, but it is blended very smoothly into the taste and the mouthfeel that it doesn't really occur to you that its over 10%.
Overall - Slightly disappointing, as I've heard so much hype of this being at least on par with and better in some people's eye with St Bernadus Abt 12 and Rochefort 10, two of my absolute favorite beers. Clearly a world class beer that was immensely enjoyable, but a beer that really needs to be served at the correct temperature, since so much of its aromas and flavors are released at higher temperatures even compared with the other two aforementioned quads. Really glad I tried it, but probably won't seek another until there's another momentous event in life. 2,126 charactersDenisKolkin, Nov 29, 2013

A: Dark brown with a bit of ruby red, thin light tan head. 
S: Cherries, molasses. Beautiful sweet aroma.
T: Sweet malt and cherries married perfectly. There is actually a slight bitterness I notice more than in most quads. Not much alcohol present at all. 
M: Excellent. Slightly dry, fine carbonation. Goes down way too easily.
O: I was not expecting this to live up to the hype. Tried it back to back with Pannepot, St. Bernardus 12, Rochefort 10 and Pannepot. Westy was the clear winner. Fantastic! 537 charactersanteater, Nov 23, 2013

4.91/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The best way to start is from the beginning....I can't recall a beer where the aroma instantly filled the air after the opening of the bottle in this matter. Right up the nostrils....
We got a solid pour into two deep wine glasses where the perfect amount of yeast sediment stayed in the bottle (I only drank that later after lamenting that the Westy was gone forever)
After reading about how many flavors and tastes would come with each sip, I certainly had my doubts only. I came to realize there was truth behind these claims. I noticed smoke and pepper with the initial sips only to catch oak on the back end. As it warmed and settled, the fruit notes took over and it became a bit more sweet with every sip.
Went down smooth and the mouthfeel was spot on.
It's a bit sad the quest is over but the end result was not disappointing at all. I walk away from the experience realizing how much I truly love Belgian beers. It will be nice knowing that I no longer have to compare other beers by saying "but I still haven't had westvleteren yet..." 1,050 charactersJC333, Nov 20, 2013

Surprised by how well this beer lives up to its reputation, and has exceeded my own personal expectations. 
Pours a muddy, warm dark brown with a creamy, off-white head that has great retention. Aroma of brandied raisins, prunes and plums, with the initial hint of cellared mustiness disappearing as it warms. The flavour has both depth and balance, with only a mild alcohol warmth in the finish belying its 10.2% ABV. The Belgian yeast complements the malt body without being overwhelming. Lots of toffee and candied fruit, as well as brandy and barrel tones. 
There's no way my description could do this justice, so will just state that I am ecstatic to have finally tried it and will purchase again, should a second opportunity ever arise... 882 charactershopsolutely, Nov 12, 2013

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I finally got a Westvleteren 12 the other day. I have been wanting one for years. A buddy of mine was able to get some on a trip to Belgium and a six pack arrived on my doorstep a few days later labeled "yeast sample".
I immediately made a run to Binny's to get some other Quads to prepare my palate and set up a blind tasting. I was told Trappistes Rochefort 10 was a great comparable so that's the one we chose to face off with the Westy. Unfortunately, the Westy 12 completely demolished the Rochefort. I was truly hoping the Rochefort would win since it's so readily available.
So, here are the details: Westvleteren 12 is a moderately deep amber, very clear (much more than the relatively cloudy Rochefort). Smell is boozy, raisins, maybe a little banana. Rochefort is more of a caramel scent. The taste of the Westy will initially throw you, striking you as overly bitter at first. As other reviewers have pointed out, you may not like this one on the first taste but it will quickly win you over. It has an extremely complex flavor. I would not say this is a "fruity" beer but there are fruit notes, along with wood and maybe even a little smoke. The finish is warm but not boozy. Perfect beer. If you are lucky enough to get some, do it justice: serve it around 60F in a perfectly clean glass, pour it carefully to avoid the sediment, have a clean palate, etc. I must say I cannot disagree that this is possibly the best beer in the world. 1,449 charactersEmpiricalBill, Nov 10, 2013

A: Deep brown with over 1 finger of off white head that reduces fairly quickly and leaves a little lacing. Love the color on this one, it's almost got a red hue, making it look like rich mahagony.
S: Very sweet, with wafting aromas of dark fruits. Plums, apricot, persimmon.
T: At first taste I wasn't too keen on this beer. After my palate adjusted (I'd been drinking water for over an hour, without having eaten anything in over 2 hours) all the flavors opened up. This is super sweet with such a rich complex balance of flavor. Leaves a sweet lingering aftertaste that just continues to bring more flavors as I exhale after each breath.
M: A high level of carbonation, and silky smooth.
O: This beer has to be the epitomy of the style. So flavorful, complex and balanced. Definitely a beer than any craft enthusiast needs to seek out at least once. 936 charactersroger617, Nov 04, 2013

Now, to the beer itself...
The appearance is burnt orange, brick red, and Colorado River mud. Partly cloudy with active carbonation but not too foamy. Just the right amount of head for a quad leaves delightful lace patterns in the glass.
Smell is beguiling. It's all about the malt and the yeast. Really no hop nose to be discerned. Biscuits, candy apple, and plum sauce come to mind. Very layered, complex, and changes with temperature.
The taste is in line with other Trappist and Abbey quadruples / grand reserves, but it struck me as more lively, fresh, and balanced. Flavors fall in line with the fragrance, with caramel and plum sauce being evident but certainly not overpowering. For a beer of this weight and ABV (over 10%), it's remarkably easy to drink.
The mouthfeel is...well, I'm just going to go with "perfect". Whatever the combination of local water, malt, brewing process, and perhaps divine blessing, it's the most pleasing beer to the palate that I have ever encountered. Sweet without being cloying or sticky. Just a hint of bitterness from hops and, presumably, a pinch of roasted malt to bring things to a harmoniously clean finish.
There's no doubt that the overall experience is enhanced by the beer's scarcity. However, taken by itself and tasted blindly, I have no doubt that "Westy" would remain stellar. While I'd stop short of calling ANY beer "the best in the world", this one is among the best. To this lucky drinker, it's earned and lived up to the hype. 1,662 charactersdv8sean, Nov 02, 2013

This beer gets one word on all levels, magical. If you ever get a chance to try or buy it you must not let it pass. If you do not have the patience to wait for a pickup date at the Abbey you can be one of the lucky travelers that gets to try a glass at the Brugge, Belgium Annual Beer Fest. Make sure you are there during one of the first days because it goes quick. 
Perfectly balanced with high ABV but sooo smooth! 
My next trip to Belgium will include a stop at the Abbey. 581 charactersBREWMONKEY27, Oct 24, 2013

4.78/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer has been reviewed over three thousand times at this point and everyone knows it's outstanding, so I'd like to point out what I thought it does especially well.
What stands out to me most about this beer and in my opinion the reason it is far better than the other trappist quads, is simply that it has one of the most perfect soft, yielding mouthfeels I've ever experienced. On top of that it is incredibly balanced sweet and subtly bitter cocoa like malt, a touch of sourness from the yeast strain. 
Yes its gonna have dark fruit (i.e. plumb, raisin), molasses, brown sugar, caramelized sugar to the point of burning, cocoa, coffee, maybe even toffee malt profile. And yes the yeast has a bready/doughly, slightly sour, phenolic quality but none of this is unique to this beer or this brewery. 
What is unique to this beer, even amongst its Belgian peers, and what makes it is so fantastic is its RESTRAINT. In a world of ever expanding malt, hop, abv content, this beer is the exemplar of refinement and what a delicate touch can create. After waiting so long to try it I'm surprised its been received as well as it has because frankly its a beer that is so complex and nuanced that it doesn't deliver the instant gratification of the massively hopped up or malted up high alcohol beers that populate the top 250. But that's also why is so amazing. 
It doesn't need to bash you over the head with sugar content, hop content, or alcohol content. It has the subtlety and restraint of a brewery who's level of maturity epitomes what it means to be confident in ones product. 1,587 charactersSnamnoum, Oct 14, 2013

The aroma has some sweet juicy dark fruit and deep brown sugar with tons of Belgian yeast and breadiness.
The flavor follows with prune, cherries, raisins, and a rolling amount of dark fruit. There's a nice deep candy sweetness along with caramel and toffee. There's tons of carbonation to pick this beer up. A bit of alcohol in there.
In the end, this beer was great, but not really about the hype. It stacks up to other quads like Rochefort, but there's this wonderful amount of estery pop that picks this beer up nicely along with big drying notes that helps separate it.
I wouldn't go crazy for it, but I would surely try it if you can. 737 charactersdar482, Oct 09, 2013

Caramel, spice, nutmeg, cloves and a unique sparkling wine/brandy combo. The alcohol is present but subtle. Than there is the mouth. Much of the same going on here. A huge malt backbone with a lot of dark fruits up front that fade immediately into a sweet caramel, almost creamy butterscotch like flavor. Nutmeg and cloves blended in perfectly again with that alcohol/wine mix followed with some licorice. Very smooth finish. Best beer in the world? Yes. Definitely! 777 charactersTortman, Oct 08, 2013

A: Pours a deep ambered ruby; with a light tan, inch of creamy foam; nice retention leaves a few strands of lace, and sticks around until the beer is finished.
S: So complex... Dark fruit - primarily plum, fig and black cherry; nutty; some light chocolate notes; toffee; lightly phenolic; a touch of alcohol.
T: Darker flavors and complex like the aroma... dried cherry and plum; toasted banana bread; light toffee flavor; molasses; almost vinous; heavy phenol (bubble gum, cotton candy, light banana) presence and a bit of hot alcohol; surprisingly bitter... earthy / leafy touch of dryness. 
M: Medium-full; creamy; lively carbonation; a touch sticky; alcohol heat on the end.
O: A delightful beer; a lot of complexity in the aroma - maybe one of the best aromas on a beer I've experienced; taste is not quite on the same level, although still very good and satisfying; mouthfeel is a bit lighter than expected, but helps bring this 10.2% to more drinkable levels.

4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75AROMA - very refined dried cherry, light and lean malty aroma with a nutty dimension, ever so slight hint of alcohol, a whisp of banana, another aroma which is moderate in intensity and could be diacetyl, caramel malt, or a combination of the two -( pleasant), bass notes of rum-raisin, all coming together to give a wonderful character of warm banana bread, lightly peppery, fresh plum skin, perhaps a faint herbal hop aroma, - this all comes off spectacularly fresh, clean ,and in balance. This is a bouquet which is noticeable upon quaffing but hardly leaps out of the glass. The overall intensity of the aroma is moderately-strong at best and very harmonious. The malt and fermentation elements stand out most and speak no louder than a robust dopplebock might.
APPEARANCE- This is a really beautiful beer. It is stark crystal clear with a gorgeous deep-ruby hue, and modest (less than one finger), but healthy and persistent off-white head. It gently gives up sparkling-wine style carbonation without being foamy or difficult to manage (3.5 volumes?). Wide legs that creep down the glass at a snail's pace.
FLAVOR- A bit simpler than the aroma. Overall impression is a lightly peppery alcohol keeping a creamy caramel/nugat malt base lively on the palate with a soft nut and vanilla finish. Malt character takes on a brown sugar/ light molasses character as sample warms. Fresh cherry, plum, red apple, red grape, and raisin notes tumble across the palate, but you must really focus to corner them. Banana notes in the aroma are nowhere to be found until sample hits room temp. No diacetyl. Barely perceptible hop bitterness that does not linger. Moderately strong peppery/ spicy quality is probably some combo of phenols, alcohol, and possibly hops, but it is not possible to determine where one begins and the other ends. Moderate malts sweetness is a big player in the balance but does not dominate impression.
MOUTHFEEL- medium-full bodied at most with a lively but never fizzy carbonation. The peppery alcohol character does grow to moderate or moderately-strong as you work through the glass, but never gets hot. Really overall a very lithe and graceful beer considering its size. I would never call it thick, slick, sticky or sweet, but would also never call it dry.
OVERALL- This is not only an extraordinarily well-made beer, but really quintessentially "Trappist". I have now sampled beer from every Trappist brewery and I don't know if it is for better or worse that most will try this one last because it makes you realize what the other breweries are aiming at. It has that semi-sweet (never dry, never cloying, but teasing you with moments of both), lightly tangy quality that must surely come from the sugar usage. Like all great strong beers, it is dangerously drinkable and unlike so many US big beers or "extreme" beers, it is not intense in any regard really. The alcohol comes on a bit strong at times, and so it is possible that aging this beer might be wise, but I'd hate to lose the wonderfully fresh malt and ester qualities that really make it sparkle. Belgian and Trappist beer fans would do well to seek this out, but those looking to get their minds blown by an intense beer would do better to spend their time and money pursuing something state-side. 3,288 charactersJudgeRoughneck, Sep 24, 2013

Silky smooth, with a dry, medium, even body. Again with the powdery feel. Interesting twang of grapes. Dextrin sweetness. More carob, golden syrup, blossom honey, toffee, medicinal phenols, anise, ginger, booze-soaked golden raisins, raw candi sugar and a watery, slightly fruity currant character. Alcohol on this one is quite boozy and warming. Bone-dry, powdery, with a residual cocoa character and alcohol breath. 701 charactersStocean1, Sep 16, 2013

The date on the cap 18/04/10. So this bottle 5-6 years old. The bottle was chilled and served in a chalice and allowed to warm up a bit. 
A- The body of the beer is chestnut brown colored a little murky. Nice highlights when the beer is held to the light. The head was off white and resolved quickly. 
S- This beer has a huge malty bready aroma. Lots of dark fruit dates, plums, and tons of raisins, almond nuttiness, brown sugar, cloves and nutmeg. Smells great!
T- The flavor of this beer is a huge malty treat, very bready, the dark fruit gives raisin / date preserve notes, lots of brown sugar a bit of banana, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves fill out the spice bill. 
M- The beer is full bodied and very smooth. The carbonation is low and nearing flat at times. This isn't a deal breaker but certainly diminishes the drinking experience. The alcohol is a non entity in the mouth. 
O- Best beer in the world? I am really enjoying this beer and would never turn a bottle down; however, I will not go out of my way to have another. Far too many other great beers available for less effort. 1,180 charactersnlmartin, Sep 13, 2013

Date: Best by 2014-08-07 (bottled 2011-08-07)
Glass: New Belgium globe glass
Westvleteren's 12 is a good, strong, Belgian ale, but not one that seems to represent the pinnacle of any particular style. The beer has heavy influences from Maillard reactions, Belgian candi sugar, and ethanol, but not in any amount or quantity different from other ales of more easy availability or lower price. I think this beer is a bit misclassified, or at least should be considered to lie between two styles, Belgian Strong Dark Ale and Quadrupel. As a BSDA, I prefer Het Anker's Cuvée Van De Keizer Blauw; as a quad, I found Rochefort's to be of more intense and enjoyable flavor. While good, aside from wanting to try this as fresh as possible to compare my experience with the two-year aged bottle, I don't think I'd pay for this again - others that are more readily available are also far less expensive.
Pours a tall, 2.5cm head of dark beige to tan-colored foam that is made up of small-sized bubbles, creating a very dense, frothy appearance. Retention is excellent, the foam lasting several minutes in a gradual decline to a thin cap atop the body of the beer that persists for the duration of drinking the glass. Lacing is excellent, thick washes, spots, and lines cling to all sides of the glass. Beer is a dark brown color, opaque, with light changing little except to bring out a slightly brighter shade of dark brown. Carbonation only visible along the top of the beer, though it seems fairly high in number and activity.
Aroma of spicy phenols, dense Maillard reaction products (ie, caramel and brown sugar), amber Belgian candi sugar, anise, and faint cocoa when warm. Quite good and enjoyable, but more reminiscent of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale to me and not a Quadruple.
Front of palate notes Maillard reaction sweetness (caramel and heavily toasted bread crusts), amber Belgian candi sugar, anise, spicy Belgian phenols, and ethanol tingle. Mid-palate experiences continued Maillard reaction sweetness (caramel and heavily toasted bread crusts), amber Belgian candi sugar, stronger spicy phenols, anise, dried dates and brown figs, and the appearance of mild ethanol. Back of palate picks up strong anise, spicy phenols, dried dates and brown figs, ethanol, with notable undercurrents of Maillard reaction products (caramel and toasted bread crust sweetness). Aftertaste of spicy phenols, anise, ethanol, atop a base of Maillard reaction products (sweetness as from caramel and heavily toasted bread crust).
Beer features a body of medium weight with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a very soft, foamy mouthfeel that would complement any beer quite well. Ethanol is felt on the nostrils, tongue, and back of the throat, but only in a marginal way, surprising for a 10% ABV beer. Closes quite dry, with substantial stickiness on the palate and lips. 2,893 charactersfalloutsnow, Aug 28, 2013

4.26/5  rDev -7.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Westvleteren chalice. Soft off-white head floats upon a tawny hued ale. Soft notes of fruit and earth waft up and invite the first sip. 
Rich fruit upfront. In particular, raisins predominate. A touch of "fruity leather" and candied ginger makes for a novel flavor profile. Very interesting mix of phenol, pepper, star anise, and cinnamon toward the finish. Compact, tight bubbles comprise carbonation, and with each sip, they provide the right amount of tickle and lift to a very complex, round ale. 
Finish is clean and powdery dry. The carbonation makes this ale deceiving as this does not drink like it is 10.2% ABV. 
Bring on the roasts and lamb. Overall, this is delightful. Way too expensive for regular enjoyment but great for special occasions (or needed moments of joy). 797 charactersZraly, Aug 26, 2013

A - Dark brown pour with a rusty\red hue. Thin white foam settles quickly. Small bubbles of carbonation are noted. There is a small bit of yeast sediment in the pour as the bottle finished.
S - Notes of raisins, honey, toffee, and molasses are noted. Such a complex aroma that I can easily see why this is often considered the pinnacle of Belgian ales. Subtle yeast aroma of French toast came from the glass.
T - In short, this delivered the goods. Rich flavors of honey and candied fruit are right at the forefront. There is a bit of a rich molasses & brown sugar flavor that gives to a warming sherry burn in the belly at the finish. This rivals any cordial I've had really I can't see what could make this better. Its worthy of the hype.
M - Uncanny how smooth this is. Leaves a sweetness on the palate similar to a tawny port wine. Rich in the taste, yet very light and the balance makes this the ultimate sipper.
O - I love Rochefort 10 and this I have to say is a bit better. It easily was the winner in a side by side with Rochefort and St. Bernardus Abt 12. This is a beer I would drop some serious coin on to get again, and a big thanks tot he distributor who hooked me with a bottle. 1,248 characterssocon67, Aug 25, 2013

4.61/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.752012 bottling poured into a Rochefort chalice. The pour is typical of a Trappist Quad - dark, deep brown in color with a nice finger of fine sandy-colored head that dies down to some nice lacing. On the nose I get lots of rich, sweet, malty goodness. There is fresh bread, dark fruits, and rum-soaked chocolate cake. I can't wait to dive in.
Full body and a sweet flavor that has some surprising spiciness. Lots of sweet malt up front as well as the dark fruit promised by the nose, but the real action is at mid-palate where the phenols and hops kick in. I was taken aback by how spicy the beer gets at mid-palate and just how much the carbonation intensifies the effect. The spicy flavors remain strong through the finish, even managing to mask the taste of the alcohol (if not the warming feeling). After the beer sits and de-gasses, the spiciness is still evident, though not as intense, and some sweet, rummy flavors come forward on the back of the palate.
What can be said about this classic beer that hasn't already been said? How about this ... It's outstanding. It's delicious. It's certainly one of the best beers in the world. It's the white whale. The MacGuffin. The Force. The bone thrown up in the air in 2001. I'm extremely fortunate and grateful that to have had an opportunity to try it. Now are you sitting down? Here goes...
I have enjoyed at least 3 or 4 other quads just has much as I'm enjoying this one (perhaps even a little bit more).
Now that the shock has worn off, I'll explain. Even though it adds to the complexity and doesn't disturb the balance, I don't particularly care for all the spiciness. For me, it gets in the way of the sweet, rich, dessert-like qualities of the beer. Some BAs will disagree, but that's just my palate. Also, I definitely taste the similarities between this and St. Bernardus Abt 12 (although this one is a little spicier). Anything else? Oh, yeah. Highly, highly recommended every BA try this at least once (if at all possible). 1,991 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Aug 18, 2013
4.93/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle into Westvleteren 12 Tulip, dated 5.10.14
Purchased from Het Beste Biertje in Málaga, Spain (drank 2 there, and 1 to take away)
Appearance: Cloudy dark mahogany brown with a decent amount of sediment, 1 finger highly carbonated white head, intricate lacing
Smell: Lot's of breadiness initially, followed by the typical trappist dark fruit notes. Also getting a lot of figs, plums, raisins, apple, and biscuity notes. Belgian yeast is highly pungent, you can smell the sweetness. Also some wood/oak smell.
Taste: Follows the nose with huge dark (almost overripe) fruit flavors off the bat, which slowly fades into a plethora of biscuity, bready notes. Roasted malt backbone is rather dark and sweet, and there's a lot of raisin and sherry presence mid-palate. Probably the lightest quad i've ever had, alcohol is distincly hidden, more so than a St. Bernardus ABT 12 or Rochefort 10. The lingering aftertaste is very sweet and leaves some wood, oaky notes in your mouth. This is one of the few beers that actually tastes better once it warms, all the flavors come out full force.
Mouthfeel: HIgh carbonation, medium to light bodied, especially for a quad
Overall: I'll try to keep this short: It lives up to the hype. Honestly I had the mindset that there really couldn't be a much better quad than a Rochefort 10 or a St. Bernardus ABT 12, but all hype aside, this is the better beer. I would love to do a blind test just to make sure... This one is so much lighter in feel but without sacrificing flavor or anything for that matter. It seems to emphasize the bready, biscuity characteristics instead of being dark fruit dominant like other quads. And I guess you can attribute it to the stellar brewing craftsmanship of the monks, but the alcohol in this is even less apparent, you could almost think you were drinking a trippel. Throughly impressed, waiting to try my 3rd one, and hopefully the other's once I make it out to Belgium again. 1,955 charactersRoman5150, Aug 17, 2013

Pours a very dark brown with mahogany highlights; too dark to judge clarity, – but yeast sediment in bottle suggests the clarity isn’t good, but that shouldn’t count against bottle conditioned beer. Three finger head of dense froth- a pale sand hue. Very good head retention for the alcohol content; a thin cap persists to the finish with large specks hanging on to the sides of my chalice. 
 The aroma is a fantastic blend of dark, very ripe fruits but not vinous, yet clean ethanol is apparent, but not boisterous. Very bready and dark malt aromas prevail, I’ve heard that this is made using only pilsner and/or pale two row, but I would swear it used a ton of Carapils and Crystal 120. The candy sugar has pushed the Belgian twanginess forward but the yeast character doesn’t overpower the malt and the very subtle hop nose is clean and flowery like light Saaz or Hallertau. 
 First sip screams malt breadlines and dark fruit that continue to dominate on the tongue, with apricot suddenly becoming particularly apparent. There is a very subtle difference between multiple decoction beers and those that fake it by altering the grist bill, but the care that went into this beer is obvious, and the finished product is executed gloriously. A brief spicy hop note in the aftertaste begins to dry the palate with some help from the booze; the hop character has no doubt faded over the past 7 years, but the bitterness still provides a solid balance. This is a sweet beer, and the hop flavor is very mellow, but still within the parameters of the style. Caramel and a dark fruit are the major players here, the overall profile is not very complicated, but the flavors and aroma are highly developed and balanced well. This is an old bottle, so the carbonation has dropped off, and the sweetness would be lifted better with a fresher sample, so I will not let a slight cloying sweetness damage the score due to my own error in over-cellaring. Bubbles are very fine and achieves a superb mouthful if one is fond of Quadruples. The body is thicker, but smooth and not oily, alcohol thins the body out enough and again, a fresher bottle would have more carbonation. 
 Finishes with waves of sweet dark malt, apricot brandy, and the quintessential Trappist funk. While it seems sinful to imbibe more than one Westy 12 in a session, I could imagine drinking 3 maximum before the sweetness becomes overpowering. I waited too long to drink this masterpiece, but even in its ripe old age, the beer is exquisite and deserves the praise it receives. 2,689 charactersPBRstreetgang, Aug 09, 2013

Poured into a Duvel tulip, hazy brown with a small off white head. 
Smell is tart fruit, cherry, plum, pretty strong flavors. 
Taste is rich fig, smoke, oak/nut, a bit of alcohol heat. 
Medium body and mouthfeel. It is bold up front, pretty balanced, but the attraction is mostly in the smell. 
It gets better as it warms, almost a marshmallow taste, Belgian Candi Sugar, prune and red fruit comes out. Very rich and complex, but it still has that alcohol bite and doesn’t go down as smooth as some of the others. 
Overall a great beer, but my friend rated it as the lowest (a step below the 2/3) and I put it as third (4th being Rochefort). Different tastes for different people, but I say there is a lot of hype to this one.

Aromas of figs, plums, candi sugar, dark chocolate, and dates. The palate is rich with fine carbonation and flavors of molasses, plum, raisins, spice, and some caramel. Finishes semi dry and not overly sticky. Well balanced. 317 characterspperez38, Aug 02, 2013

4.54/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Two vintages in front of me, 2013 and 2005. The younger is slightly lighter, with much less sediment, both carefully poured. Thin head exists on both, more so on the younger vintage, light lacing. Dark, ruby and amber tones.
Nose is much more assertive with the older vintage, candi sugar, dark fruit and booze. Apple-ish esters exclusive to the older vintage, come into the back of the nose after sipping.
2013: Intense dark fruit, plum, raisin and dates. Burnt caramalized sugar, fruit esters, light diacetyl. Sweet with a harsh alacohol burn on the throat. Full bodied with a nice level of carbonation.
2005: Smooth, muddled fruit. Berries? Much sweeter than the young bottle. Ever try a milk chocolate covered raisin? Imagine that in s'mores, the sweetness of marshmellow, faint bittness associated with fine chocolate and a bready element thrown into the mix. A lot going on here. Alcohol is less prevelent but still present. The vintage bottle is thinner than the younger example.
Worth a try, for sure. Lucky enough to be in Belgium during the time of this review but the vintage bottle still broke the bank. I like them both, but prefer it with age. My guess would be that four years, somewhere in the middle of these two vintages... Could be perfection. Taking a couple fresh bottles home with me, time will tell! 1,326 charactersMarkJBurch, Jul 30, 2013

My straight honest opinion was this was not the best Trappist beer I've ever had. The dark fruits and spicy notes came through fully, but did not floor me as "the best beer in the world". The hype definitely comes from it's limited availability methinks. 366 charactersbnelson997, Jul 30, 2013

3.73/5  rDev -19.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.5I'm sure this is a bit too soon to give this beer a fair review, but I've been holding it since the US release and well it's a year old finally so I couldn't hold myself back. 
Poured into a St Bernardus glass. I poured a bit too gingerly and as a result no head to speak of. A murky dark brown with marginal but noticeable non the less legs. 
The nose is of spices, molasses, caramel, sugar, dark fruits, and raisins. 
The flavor is of spiced rum, caramel, rum soaked raisins and plums. The sugars are high, but the spices seem to keep them from pushing too far forward. I believe there is still a bit of a hop bite, not really adding much but perhaps enhancing the spices. Clearly this is a bit too fresh. As I drink this the sugars are almost taking on a bit of a fake sugar element. There is just something very so slightly off. 
As I said before this one is a bit fresher than it should be. Still at a year old I'd think it would be a BIT more refined. Who's got 3-4 years to wait for a beer? The beer starts out a bit too bubbly and finishes a bit hot still. I imagine both will be better with age.
I'm torn on this review. I believe a beer should be nearing high marks even if it requires age at a year. I however have been told 3 years is where this one needs to be. I just can't justify not marking a beer off for wanting 3 years of cellaring to drink. That said this is complex as hell, the flavors are well balanced and well put together. With that said it's not for me. The flavors will mellow and blend more but the end result will still be a beer that's too sugary and has spices that I can pass on. 1,618 charactersbobhits, Jul 29, 2013

A - pours dark red with a minimal tan head. Notable sediments.
S - Enormous aroma, smells predominantly of raisins and a dark chocolate brownie (at least to me)
T/M - I was expecting a boozey tinge however none found; extremely well balanced. Coated my tongue deliciously. Well bodied, carbonation was excellent. Taste was spot on with the scents, impressed on the drinkability.
O - This is the mother of all Quads; the standard set by Westy is impeccable. At the end of it all you're left with a beautiful toasty to borderline malty after taste; licking your lips. 776 charactersSlap_and_Pickle, Jul 23, 2013

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It's really unnecessary for me to review this beer. It's perfect but there are a couple highlights I'd like to share. First of all, the actual bottle itself has some serious weight to it making the iconic bottle an awesome momento and keep sake. 
The other thing that really stood out to me was the taste. I've always stuck to a misplaced stereotype that quads are heavy, but as I've enjoyed better beers in this category I've come to appreciate that they are not heavy at all. This beer has a serious lightness to it that makes it very drinkable, you almost forget to slow down and savor it.
The first time I drank this brew we paid nearly $60/bottle... Thank goodness 4 of us were splitting a six pack. I get it, it's impossible to find and therefore its unavailability is a downside; however I believe this beer is the one exception to the rule based on the duration of time it has held a near perfect rating.
In fact other beers are considered the #1 beer in the world just to keep this beautiful brew out of the top slot very single year. But look it up, it's true, and frankly the monks don't care what we think. We've been lucky to get our hands on quite a stash so my dear friend is cellaring some for 1,3,5, & 7 years.... Should be a good decade. Cheers. 1,266 charactersAbbbp, Jul 17, 2013

I had all their offerings, including the ice cream which tasted like a BJ from Jessica Alba would feel! Spectacular!! 
Malty, dark, sweet and lingering ending that absolutely invited another drink. And then another. I did a side by side comparison with St. Bernardus abt 12 and it was then that the complexity of the westy really shined. The St.B seemed almost thin compared to the rich flavors of the westy. It's a contemplative beer that invites a slow enjoyment. It'd be heaven with roast fowl and autumn chill. 628 characterstyboxr, Jul 15, 2013

Appearance: Brownish-red, tons of sediment, tan head that lingers from a mild pour. 
Aroma: Cherry tartness is quite prominent. Dark fruits, toffee, slight sour funk.
Taste: Cherry sourness is, again, in the forefront. A beautiful vanilla taste is to be found lying within. Slight alcohol flavors are to be found as well. Additionally, it is bready and the toffee lingers well into the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Medium-thick body, medium carbonation. 
Overall: I like this. Really happy I was able to try it, but ultimately I do think I like Rochefort 10 the most of the big quads. I'll have to pick up another one of those to try again and determine. Regardless, this one really surprised me with the slight funk and sour fruit notes, alongside the normal quad flavors. A great beer. 826 charactersChrisKayler, Jul 10, 2013

A: Pours a turbid dark brown. Enormous and ridiculously huge fluffy yet dense light brown head. Starts out dense, gets fluffier as it fades. Fades very slowly. Huge thick layers of lacing everywhere. Top notch head retention. Perfect.
S: Very strong aroma, I can smell it from the other side of the desk. Smells like toast from a distance (even my wife commented on it and she's sitting 5ft away from it). Upon closer inspection, very sweet caramel with loads of dark fruits. Raisins primarily. Other fruits in there, fig, prunes? A bit of toasted malt is notable as well. A little bit of booze but not much. Very pleasant aroma. 
T: Again with the sweetness. Sweet caramel up front but sweet grains in the finish. Dark fruit up front. A bit of toasted bread towards the finish, like yeasty dough almost. Has a somewhat nutty character in the middle. Fairly harsh grain alcohol in the finish and lingering aftertaste. Some spices picking up here and there. 
M: Heavy-ish but not overly so. Very smooth and easy drinking.
O: Very different from how I remember this one from years ago. I remember noting how the alcohol was completely hidden but in this one there is a lot of alcohol phenols in the aroma and aftertaste. Having said that, this is easily the best quad I've had. Very nice flavors all integrated with each other. Balance is excellent, drinkability is excellent. I look forward to re-reviewing an aged bottle at some point, I feel like this one might be too green given the alcohol harshness. 1,674 charactersDope, Jul 05, 2013

Giant runaway head settles into a sticky, fingers width blanket of retention. Eggplant color when held to light.
Not as aromatic as I was anticipating. In fairness the smell has a hefty head to break through. Deep, dark merlot - very wine-y and nutty, coppery earth, dark fruit and dandelion.
Very effervescent at first the bubbles quickly calm down and give way to a plush, pillow mouthfeel. There's plenty of flavor here to pick out, some things I found: red wine, brownie batter, bitter backer's chocolate, toffee, earth and soil and even some birch beer. Still packs some heat.
So, so complex and layered. As it sits more flavors emerge and the complexity evolves. Like an evolutionary organism right in my glass. 837 charactersdonkeyrunner, Jun 27, 2013

Split it with a friend.
knew about the hype, but was prepared for anything.
smelled sweet, figs, etc.
tiny bit of lacing that gave way pretty quick.
snifter time
took deep smells before each sip.
this one lived up to the hype. I really like quads anyways, so this style is right up my alley. I didnt have them side by side, but this seemed to have a little more body, a little more sweetness, and just a little bit more character than Abt 12. that said, getting St Bernardus almost anywhere I want for 1/2 the price and not going across the globe makes a lot more sense.
I really enjoyed this beer, and I think my expectations were in check. Almost feels like some people expect it to be something better than beer! This is world class stuff and I am glad to check it off the list. Now I can go back to my Abt. 12 knowing that it stacks up to Westy quite favorably 899 charactersderftron, Jun 24, 2013

After the tour (having sampled 8 other awesome beers from Belgium + chocolate ), we were given the option of going to a place that served this.
Of course we accepted.
Bottle was unlabeled and we were not allowed to keep. Place we went to was in a back alley. Locals only.
Very rich and flavorful. Being younger I tried to take in as much as I could, however, when I had the beer I had not much to compare. I do remember it being special.
The worst part was the 3+ hr train ride back to Amsterdam !! But at least I got to try it and keep the bottle cap. 683 charactersIPAIsaac, Jun 22, 2013

4.6/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz(?) brown Westvleteren Trappist style bottle with a spot raised midway a lot like the Westmalle bottle. Absolutely no label here. Yellow Gold/Black cap on top. Bottle really reminds me of authentic Belgian abbey style. A sleek and to the point bottling.
Poured this into a Westvleteren Trappist goblet that was almost as difficult to acquire as the 12 itself. 
A - Hazy dark brown with lighter golden brown highlights around the top edges of the glass. Head was cream colored and sat just long enough to take a few photos before it vanished into a thin ring of lace. Pretty normal Trappist stick to the glass Which isn't much at all.
S - fresh bread and a nutty character. Cinnamon rolls caked with gooey icing, dark fruit with figs and raisin. Baked dates and A nice Belgian yeast aroma with some booze, but not bad booze. This aroma is sweet and complex with multiple layers and spice. Very pleasant whiffs as every note is noticed and appreciated.
T - more cinnamon rolls and fresh bread. Nutty with a lot of dark fruit. Fig, dates and raisin. Biscuity and a perfect yeast strain. Ripe banana and dead on spices. Light cloves and cinnamon notes. Small flavor of sweet chocolate in the background that's noticed as the ale warms a bit. An abbey booziness in the finish that only adds to the flavor. Flavor has a Real brilliance about it.
M - pretty smooth and almost velvety. Coats the every inch of the mouth with so many different flavors its almost crazy. Smooth and delightful feel despite its booze and abv. I'd drink this all day every day if I could get it and had nothing else to do of course lol.
O - some of these authentic Trappist ales make me think to myself that if I didn't have 2 beautiful little boys at home I'd move to Belgium and take up a life of prayer, a life of work, and a life in a community while wearing wool robes. Just as long as I got to drink stuff like this everyday. But hey I wouldn't trade my family for anything so I quickly come back to reality. Anyway, this is the God Father of all the Trappist brews and the King of fine Belgian ales in general. It has a rep that's nearly unmatched and often great Trappist brews are overlooked due to the mystery and the need to know that comes with the Westy 12. It's definitely one of the best crafted brews on the planet, but aren't all Trappist ales? It's the world's best quad, but is it that much better than the Rochefort 10? Yes to me it is, but its not on a whole different level. Both are in that top tier of best quads. What the Westy 12 does offer are flavors no other quad provide and an experience every craft beer lover deserves to have. In fact an experience everyone deserves to have over and over again. It's a shame this thing isn't easier to get ahold of. Bc its easily not only one of the best I've ever had, but would be one of my favorites to pick up throughout every year. Ill definitely be paying close attention for my next experience of this Belgian gem. 2,971 charactersBradtheGreat7, Jun 17, 2013

Aroma: I was really wowed by the nose on this beer. Super pungent, sweet dark fruits- figs, raisins along with a little bit of blueberry sweetness. There is quite a bit of Belgian yeastiness that I've come to associate with dubbels and quads- really complements the sweetness very well with its spiciness. Smells incredibly delicious, quite sweet, and keeps getting better as it warms up. (4.5)
Colour: Dark brown, not quite black but more like a mahogany brown. Pours a thick (a bit thinner than super thick and viscous) body. Its not quite motor oil but this is quite viscous. The head is a 1cm white, perhaps slightly tan, head that becomes a somewhat thick film on the beer. Looks delicious, like a dessert. (4.5)
Flavour: It was an incredible beer. A tasty melange of Belgian spiciness of cloves, maple syrup, figs, raisins, blueberries, and caramel. The yeast and hops mellows out the sweet malt. I think that compared to some of the other quads I've had, this puts together a great bit of flavours high in complexity that is incredibly mellow and pleasing to drink. (4.75)
Mouthfeel: Thick bodied, very viscous and incredibly chewy. Carbonation was solid, nothing special. Aftertaste is the spiciness of the yeast, which was incredible. Smooth and incredibly easy to drink! It's too bad there's only 33cl of this beer in a bottle. (4.5)
Overall: Incredible quad, one of the best beers I have ever had. I thought it was all hype and came in with a jaundiced eye, but this one really blew me away, which was an incredibly nice surprise. It's not that the specific flavours in this beer were especially great compared to other quads that I've had, but it all came together incredibly well. I think that's the difference between this beer and all the others. (4.75) 1,904 charactersStevedore, Jun 16, 2013

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: foamy tan head, medium burgundy color, opaque
Aroma: beet, prune, slightly sugary malt character, Belgian yeast character-- pungent and slightly earthy
Taste: blast of sugary sweetness at first, then developing beet/prune/date flavor, with supporting bitterness, and surprisingly balanced and somewhat dry finish
Mouthfeel: High carbonation, tingly in mouth, surpringly light bodied for the style (medium body), nimble and not at all cloying,
Overall Impression: This is the Quad to end all Quads. An immediate dark fruit punch in the mouth with slowly developing dark malt and yeast character that somehow manages to stay medium bodied and a slightly dry finish. Although it is very similar in taste to most well made quads, its nimble body and drying finish take the Westy XII to another level. This is a malt bomb that is amazingly drinkable. 862 charactersdwren89, Jun 12, 2013

A: Mahogany in color, the beer pours less viscous than expected and forms a small, wispy head. Leaves almost no lacing.
S: The nose is comprised of distinct notes of maple and toffee, toasty sweetbread and alcohol. Esters are readily apparent, as notes of holiday spice linger in the boozy bouquet. 
T: Malt-forward, caramel and toffee notes leap to the front of the palate. The sweet overtone reveals distinct banana esters and cherry-ish phenols. The candy-like profile is kept in check by ample hop presence and spicy alcohol, as subtle notes of cinnamon and clove work to dry the palate. Remarkably, the beer finishes relatively short and clean, leaving a touch of cherry and caramel lingering.
M: Much more chewy and viscous than the beer appears, but the ample carbonation scrubs the palate clean between sips.
It seems there are a lot of beers in the top of the list that've climbed by inertia (especially the top beer). This isn't one of them. A couple hundred years of trial and error, coupled by the fact that the brewers don't make a profit...at least monetarily speaking, makes this one of the most interesting and satisfying experiences you can have imbibing a brew. 1,229 charactersrand, Jun 10, 2013

M-nice warm pleasant.
Served in a chalice at In De Vrede, across the street from the abbey. It killed me that no beer was available for takeaway this day, but 4.80 euro a glass was a nice consolation prize. Without a side-by-side comparison I can't say that this is the best beer in the world, but it's easily in the top three that I've ever tasted.
The head and lacing maintained throughout. The color against the light was thick and dark with a lovely glow. Each sip brought out an ever-changing taste.
Compared side by side with the 5 and the 8, this was easily my favorite, and I happily ordered a second round. Well worth the trip! 796 charactersdanostrat, Jun 07, 2013

It fizzed up quite a bit, like a soda, and then quickly dissipated into a thin head with a rich, deep caramel color base. The nose was perfectly sweet, with strong notes of candied figs and dates. For a quad, I was surprised at how mellow and sweet it was, rather than dark and powerful. I thought it was really drinkable for a 10%, and could easily put down more than one bottle if afforded the opportunity. The alcohol was warm, but not overpowering. It had a bold feel, but not chokingly strong. Again, mellow was the word I kept thinking of, with a bit of a sticky finality that I think was more in my head from the fruit smell/taste than actually having me smacking my lips. Overall, I was afraid after all the hype I would be slightly disappointed, but it was actually the opposite. I was even more impressed with this than I hoped I could be. Absolutely worth going out of your way to enjoy. 1,005 charactersyankeepride, Jun 07, 2013

The aroma is more bright fruit based than I'm used to for a quad rather than blatant caramel and prune like I'm used to.
The flavor is much like a double, but with additional fruit. Some raisin and plum as well as apple. Bubblegum in the background. Almost a hint of scotch ale flavor.
The feel is full yet light. Slightly sticky aftertaste. 
Overall I was quite impressed with this. It was far less sweet than I expected, and that was quite welcoming. The apple was quite nice too. I'm quite glad that I tried this. I didn't expect it to live up to the hype, but it's the best quad I've had to date. It even makes me optimistic about trying quads again. 730 charactersBBP, Jun 02, 2013

A-A normal pour produces a dark chestnut colored brew that is nearly opaque with reddish highlights. There is a bubble or two of carbonation visible. The head is one and one-half fingers of dense, tan head. The retention is good.
S-The smell is sweet, intense, and full of dried dark fruits, over-ripe banana, hints of spice, molasses, and a touch of leather. The fruity alcohol is well-integrated into the mix. It smells really lovely if you like your quads on the sweet side.
T-The taste, like the smell is loaded with dark, sweet dried fruit notes. The banana is still present, but a strong spice note (pepper and clove) comes through, along with some dark cherry and just a hint of earthy leather. The alcohol is warming and sweet.
M-The beer is more carbonated that some quads, but the feel remains pretty soft and the carbonation works with the big flavors well.
O-Hype notwithstanding, I was blown away by how complex and pleasing the flavors were in this beer. I know there is some debate about whether this brew is really better than Rochefort or St. Bernardus (or De Struise or...whatever), but for me, it really hits all the sweet spots. I mean that literally and figuratively because the beer really is quite sweet, but unlike some others, I did not feel this was cloying or syrupy. 1,336 charactersspoony, May 31, 2013

A- Pours an opaque medium brown color with a 1/2 inch dark tan head. It loses retention quickly and becomes a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Thick, semi-resilient lacing slides quickly down the glass and minimal surface foam.
S- Boozy aroma reminds me of a barleywine, once I swirl, I get a nice waft of Belgian candi sugar and toasty malt. Still, the alcohol sticks out unpleasantly.
T- And there's a sharp booziness in the flavor too, followed by some faint raisin and dark fruit. Once the palate acclimates, things mellow out a bit. Semi-sweet, somewhat toasty with a syrupy aftertaste. Not very complex.
M- A bit stinging from the booze, sticky and dry. Medium carbonation and a hefty body.
This is a very good beer, but I feel that it is wildly overrated based on it limited availability. Maybe I should have let it sit longer, but I feel like it should be good fresh as well considering all the hype surrounding it. A pretty big letdown but I guess my expectations were quite high. I I compared this to Abt 12 which I found to be superior. 1,117 characterscsrbv, May 29, 2013

The owner of the place I got it from took out a bottle, poured it into a westy12 glass and the head just kept on going thru the tip of the glass, and staying there. Took a frew big, deep breaths into my nose and trying to get a hint of anything going on off the top of the glass. Sipped it, took a bigger sip and let it sit in my mouth, trying to get some of the initial tastes. 628 characterstholm273, May 23, 2013

I had a small taste of it years back, but having a taste is not the same as having an entire bottle to yourself. It also isn't the same as being in the cafe across the street of the monastery and having it served properly in its own chalice. The main event is here. On to the beer:
A large rocky head sits on top of this dark, creamy brown colored beer. It retains well and leaves reasonable lace around. The aroma is...not as intense as expected. It features notes of plum, chocolate, and pudding, however I needed to dig deep to find this subtle, lovely notes.
The flavor puts this beer on track. The flavor is as intense as I thought and does feel more so than the 8. Ironincally, soft yeasty fruit hits first, followed by figs, a peppery biterness, pudding, and dark chocolate. Very deep in flavor, and the full creamy body of the beer suits the beer very well. Yum yum yum!
On its own, Westvleteren 12 is an excellent beer. If you're not at In de Vrede, it's a bit of work to track down a bottle, even at bottle shops in Brussels! Everyone shoud try this beer at least once. 1,116 charactersDoubleJ, May 21, 2013

A: A beautiful hazy ruby or deep maple colour. A small tan head of about 1 finger appears, but some halo sticks around for your enjoyment the entire time.
S: The first smell I pick up is the yeast. It is gentle and pleasant. Dark fruits are there as well as hints of caramel and yes a bit of alcohol.
T: Carrying over from the smell, the dark fruits come to the fore on this beer. It is fantastically flavorful with so much going on. What jumps out at me is the fact that the yeast is somewhat hidden in the taste.
M: Incredibly smooth. Carbonation is perfect and there is little boozy finish on this. The beer leaves a lovely memory in your mouth with a great warm finish.
O: This is a superior beer. I hemmed and hawed as to whether I should actually pay the price for this, and in the end, it was well worth it (and quite reasonable considering). I prefer Belgian quads and tripels so to me this is like nirvana. What was surprising and pleasant was the complexity of the smell/taste. The fruitiness hid the yeast and the alcohol stayed in the background until the end. I've had Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt. 12 and Westvleteren just reaches above those making it well worth the chase. 1,278 characterspolloenfuego, May 18, 2013

It pours into the challice a deep, slightly murky brown color with a thick, tan head of foam. Excellent head retention.
Smells of rich dark fruits, caramel, fresh baked bread, cloves, and a slightly vinous grape aroma.
The smoothness of this beer on the palate is incredible. The alcohol is very well hidden. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with an incredible richness.
I went in expecting it to not meet up to the hype, but it actually almost does. I'm a big fan of Belgian dark ales, and this might actually top St. Bernardus Abt. 12 and Rochefort 10 for me. Incredible beer. 726 charactersDanny1217, May 12, 2013

A: the color of dark maple syrup with a hint of a beige head
S: almond and vanilla, was expecting a stronger smell but that probably comes with aging (will write again in 2 years now that I'm cellaring my case!). The La Trappe Oak aged gives off a much stronger scent but this one has some nice notes.
T: coffee and chocolate sweetness to start, finishing with bitter alcohol and even a hint of hops, didn't expect that from a quad. This is quite distinct from Rochefort 10 or St. Bernardus ABT 12.
M: more carbonation than I expected. Light tingles down the throat.
O: I drank the three other quads referenced in this review within 9 days of finally drinking this one and, I'll admit, I struggle to separate my review from the beer's mystique. To be honest, I like the other three better. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Westy 12 with some slices of a very buttery brie cheese. Like I said, I think the magic of quadrupels comes in the aging so I'll write again in a few years. 1,040 charactersLiquid_Bread, May 11, 2013

Deep russety brown appearance with a hint of murkiness when held up to the light. Nice beige foam on top doesn't require any coaxing to stay at about a finger in height.
Intriguing smell. Lots of dark fruit with figs, dates, prunes some spice there as well. Reminds me of some red wine at certain stages, not that I drink much wine. Seems to have the warming alcohol bring out the spice without inflaming the situation. Brilliant!
Spicy, cinnamon and allspice are there along with the dark fruits of plum and figs and prunes. Seems to transition from the spices on the front to the fruit on the back and then some spice right at the end to keep you really, really interested. Really dry ending.
The body is solid, but by no means too big, i think the spice helps cut through things. Nice interaction between the spice, the warming alcohol and the fruity smoothness. Really well done.
Don't recall ever having liked this as much as i like this sampling. I always seemed to prefer the 8 out of the Westvleteren brews, but this is helping change my mind. Not a big fan of Quads, but this is very well done and so well integrated. 1,170 charactersMrKennedy, May 02, 2013

I will add that I was at the abbey today, and ordered one at the tavern right across the way (Owned and operated by the Abbey). They serve it very cold which I personally like and recommend for any beer. However, I noticed that this beer has more taste dimensions when served at cellar temperatures. If you have more than one to try then savour it at cellar temp and see if you agree. 490 charactersThe_Beer_Nut, Apr 30, 2013

I am maybe most impressed by how well the alcohol is hidden. one would never know this beer is so strong. one of those rare moments when you feel a connection with people you have never and may never meet. this beer is like a brotherhood of sorts, and I am humbled and honored to be a part of it now.
edit: just as good or even better after five years in the cellar. wow, this is definitely the defining moment of the style. thanks drlovemd87! 1,712 charactersStonedTrippin, Apr 28, 2013

A- Pours an opaque medium brown color with a 1/2 inch dark tan head that's very crackly for a quad as it loses retention quickly and becomes a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Thick, semi-resilient lacing slides quickly down the glass and minimal surface foam.
S- Boozy aroma reminds me more of a barleywine than a quad although, once I swirl, I get a nice waft of Belgian candi sugar and toasty malt. Still, the alcohol sticks out unpleasantly.
T- And there's a sharp booziness in the flavor too, followed by some faint raisin and dark fruit. Once the palate acclimates, things mellow out a bit. Semi-sweet, somewhat toasty with a syrupy aftertaste. Not very complex.
M- A bit stinging from the booze, sticky and dry. Medium carbonation and a hefty body.
O- I love quads, but this is probably the most overrated one I've ever had. Maybe I should have let it sit longer, but I feel like it should be good fresh as well considering all the hype surrounding it. A pretty big letdown but I guess my expectations were quite high. Either way, definitely not worth the money. 1,129 charactersImmortale25, Apr 25, 2013

Appearance- Beautiful hazy orangeish/brown with huge three finger fluffy white head that dissipated surprisingly quick. Lots of yeast floating around. Crazy lacing.
Smell- Cherry, tobacco, rich bready belgian yeast, dark dried fruit, vanilla. The list goes on, but this is one of the most layered beers I've had the pleasure to have. 
Taste- Vanilla, plum, raisons, fresh bread. Finish is pure raison. Yeasty character isn't as pronounced as in the smell which is nice for me. Sweet clean lingering flavors.
Mouthfeel- Tons of bubbly carbonation with a nice resiny stickiness. Clean without the booze heat one might expect from a 10% (especially with 5 years on it.
Overall- Quads are a hit or miss with me, but this is hands down the best quad I've had. Truly a beautiful beer. 891 charactersSeanniek91, Apr 24, 2013
4.78/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52008 bottle
A - Pours a murky red/brown with lots of head and lots of sediment. A bit of lacing.
S - Alcohol, dark fruit, vanilla, cloves, apricot, and brown sugar.
T - So much going on with this one. Plums and raisins are at the forefront with hints of brown sugar, cloves, roasty malts, and a bit of cloves and spices. Not a hint of the 10.2% ABV. 
M - So smooth with lots of carbonation and no burn. Incredibly drinkable.
This certainly lives up to the hype. Just sweet enough with the perfect balance of flavors and not a hint of alcohol after the smell. Glad to finally try this and would happily welcome another. 623 charactersRoninTK3, Apr 24, 2013
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5300 ml bottle, one of six from the recent overseas release. 
Pours a deep, cloudy mahogany, two plus inches of yellow-white foam dissipates very slowly to a lacing, leaves some tracks down the inside of the glass.
Smells of rich cocoa, molasses, bananas, white wine grapes, caramel, slightly toasty bread and a hint of licorice, cloves, and cinnamon. Of note is the exceptional balance of all these aromas; despite sound like a weird mixture, they fit together perfectly. 
The flavor is nutty at first, mildly bitter but also rich like hazelnut. What follows is a bit of cocoa and wine-like grape fruitiness. The conclusion is banana, caramel, and cloves. The beer manages to be rich without being cloying in the least, and seems to balance a malty sweetness with a wine-like dryness. Subtle hints of bitter hop sneak in as the beer warms. There are savory elements as well.
The ale is full-bodied and features as an expansive effervescence that feels refreshing and seems to fill the cheeks and tingle on the roof of the mouth. 
This beer absolutely lives up to the hype and perhaps even exceeds my expectations. A picture of this beer should appear next to the definition for "world class" in the dictionary. Absolutely a worthwhile experience. If you have the opportunity to try this beer, take it. While I am sure some will still find it overrated, I feel most will certainly not be disappointed. 1,405 charactersCylinsier, Apr 24, 2013

4.56/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I've been saving this brew for a little while since receiving it via joemcgrath27 in a cross-Canada trade (madd props!). The moment has arrived with the birth of our baby daughter this past Monday.
A - Poured into the Westvleteren goblet. Before sediment it pours a crystal clear ruby red, finger of head with some retention and no real lacing. A murky amber brown after sediment.
S - Rich caramel and dark fruit, figs, candied apple, rye bread, toffee, hints of chocolate and cocoa alongside a heavy dose of cloves and a touch of booziness.
T - Pre-sediment pour had a stronger cocoa and burnt malt flavour, dark fruit notes were prominent throughout and post-sediment pour the heavier cloves and candied fruit notes come through. Vineous grape notes, earthy hops and a lingering bitterness come through alongside a hint of ABV heat and sweetness.
M - Lighter bodied ale that is incredibly smooth and finishes surprisingly wet.
O - This is one tasty quad and it certainly lives up to the hype. Insanely drinkable, which I would imagine would only improve with time. The high ABV is incredibly well hidden amongst a complex flavour profile. Not only was this an incredible brew, it made for the perfect drink to celebrate such an incredible moment. Thank for sending this treat along Joe!! 1,294 charactersandrenaline, Apr 20, 2013
4.21/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25So, one of the best beers in the world, ever... Been waiting for this one for quite some time. Managed to get two bottles fromhet very limited release at Systembolaget.
Looks the part, murky with plenty of sediment... 
The smell that rises from the glass is sweet, absolutely a Quad. Hints of raisins, plums... In the back I sense som yeast and a bit of booze.
Taste... Well, still a bit sweet, Brown sugar blended with the plums from the smell. Not really a lingering taste at all. Only left with a bit of sugar on the tongue. 
Honestly... If it wasn't fot the whole Westie thang, I would put a beer like Rochefort 10 way ahead of this. In no way is this bad, it is in fact very good. But world-class? Not for me... 720 charactersJamFuel, Apr 19, 2013

4.33/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Time to move on from the blond and the dubbel and hit up the quad I drove out to the middle of nowhere to try. Notes from tasting fresh at the brewery in Dec 2010, bottle cap reads 04.08.13. Poured the bottle into the Westvleteren chalice this beer has a thick tight tan head that has some staying power and laces the glass. Dark brown to black on top, lighter brown color noted towards the thin bottom. Aromas are toasted barley malt, with a chocolate characteristic. Great mouthfeel. Complex, very smooth with the alcohol hidden amongst all the other flavors. Super drinkable for such a high ABV beverage. The complexity of this beer is quite great, this is definitely the best of the 3 beers. Compared to the other great quads of Belgium I'd put this one in the world class category but a notch below St. Benardus Abt. 12 given slightly less estery goodness and the price and availability issue. Well now that I'm here I better have another...I might never get another. 972 charactersdeebo, Apr 17, 2013

Appearance: This is a great looking beer very dark and cloudy in appearance has a relatively high carbonation while consuming. 
Smell: Smells a lot like the Westy 8 did a lot of dark fruit smells figs, cherries, brown sugar and molasses. 
Taste: Getting a lot of the same tastes that I did with the Westy 8, dark fruits and sugars amazing flavor very powerful but not overwhelming. Can not really taste much of the alcohol but defiantly a great flavor, some spice in the brew.
Mouthfeel: Smooth yet spiced. Carbonation is prevalent seems very light. 
Overall: This beer has been on my radar for a very long time and I am pleased to say that I was not let down. This is a wonderful beer, I absolutely love this beer. 764 charactersBleedcold, Apr 14, 2013

4.64/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a murky brown in color with some light amounts of visible carbonation and some mahogany highlights. The beer has a finger tall light tan head that slowly reduces to a medium to large thin patch, a very thin film covering about 75% of the remainder of the surface of the beer, and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
S: There is a fair amount of sweetness to the aroma of this beer - caramel, molasses, candi sugar, and dark fruits (cherries, plum, date, and fig). Very light aromas of booze.
T: Upfront there are flavors of dark fruits with cherries dominating and more moderate amounts of plum, fig, and date. There is a decent amount of sweetness but never enough to become cloying - caramel, molasses, candi sugar, and toffee are all present. Moderate flavors of Belgian yeast and just a touch of spices. Light hint of cocoa powder in the finish.
M: Just shy of full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly creamy with a light amount of alcohol warming in the finish.
O: Great complexity to the aromas and flavors make this a world class beer. It is easy to drink and enjoyable, I would gladly have another one of these in the sitting. The alcohol is not completely hidden but it is not overwhelming and there is sweetness but not cloyingly so. 1,318 charactersdbrauneis, Apr 12, 2013

A- Pours a muddy brown, sediment filled body with a beautiful and perfectly sized khaki colored head, creamy head that leaves a little lacing. As it reduces, the top of the head forms a few brown swirls.
S- Fruity esters, white grapes, vanilla, baked bread, unripe bananas, burned sugar, raisins, a little booze. 
T- Upfront I get candi sugar, nutty notes, light citrus, bananas, dark fruits. This progresses into a roastyness with caramel and fruits that sits on the tongue for a bit. Not getting much alcohol which is good for the 10.2 ABV. 
M- Very easy to drink, creamy, medium body with medium-low carbonation. 
Was this a world class, complex, easy drinking belgian? Absolutely yes. Was it the best beer in the world? That's debatable. I could see it holding that title a few years back, but now that it has competitors with similar (if not better) taste profiles, I think not. Don't get me wrong, this beer was amazing. Anyone who has access to it needs to try it at least once. But it's price and rarity are a sky high, and if you can't get a hold of one don't lose sleep over it. 1,184 charactersgcamparone, Apr 10, 2013

A: Pours with a generous carmel-colored head, with an opaque but not translucent brownish body.
S: Smells like caramel and sugar.
T: Rich sugary taste throughout, though not uncloyingly so. Hints of spice at the end, though most of the flavor is taken up by the Belgian yeasts and wheat.
M: Deep, satisfying mouthfeel that matches the 11% abc without the harsh aftertaste.
O: Overall, certainly one of the best beers I've had. 538 characterslhaqq, Apr 05, 2013

First thing I noticed is a white soapy head floating on a beautiful dark amber liquid. Great subtle smell with lots of dried fruits and a bit of alcohol. The taste is very nice--slightly dank with more fruits and a touch of sweetness. The real strength of this beer is the mouthfeel, in my opinion--super-soft and almost creamy. Well-balanced, overall.

Poured in De Molen snifter
Appearance: The 12 has a reddish/brown hue and pours a white/tan head. Laces the glass quite well. 
Smell: This is where the beer really sets itself apart from other quads. It has the beautiful fruity smell so typical of Westvleteren beers. Not surprisingly, sweet dark fruits hit the nose first. Like the 8, the esters really shine through right off the bat. It's reminiscent of old fashioned bubble gum, the kind you find at a baseball game. Bready aromas, like fresh rye covered with stroop. Caramel and toffee mixes in with all these scents to make the 12 smell more like a dessert than a beer.
Taste: The sharp dark fruit bite is at the forefront and is pleasantly, but ever so slightly bitter. Like the smell, the taste of the beer is more comparable to a desert cake than a beer. Dates, raisins, brown sugar, toffee, and clove all mix together to attempt to veil the alcohol. The bready malts form a good base to the beer, reigning in, and complementing all the other aspects. 
Overall: This is a truly beautiful beer. The pleasant dark fruit bite reminds me of the Westmalle dubbel, which isn't surprising considering they share the same yeast (or so I've heard). I'm not on the bandwagon of ''Westvleteren 12: Best Beer in the World'' but I will say it surely is one of the greatest. It is delicately crafted, and a real treat to the taste buds. 1,550 characterstruebluebums, Mar 25, 2013

A - honestly, I've had enough of the heavy hitting quads to know that they all pour a big head. Westvleteren 12 is no different: huge foam is relentless throughout, but there's hardly any sediment. Brown and plain, but certainly not unattractive.
S - yum. Westy 12 smells like a complete dinner. There's a lot of sweet stickiness that hits the nose at first, caramel maybe, but then it turns savory, meaty, and substantive. 
T - not quite as sweet as I expected from reading the reviews, but there's definitely something lacking in the taste, a kind of emptiness that hits right at the end. Some quads, like Rochefort 10, can get over this yeasty hump, but I don't think Westy 12 does it quite as successfully. There's plenty of sweetness on the front, but very little of the savoriness I got from the smell.
M - incredibly creamy and smooth. No carbonation to speak of, no alcohol to speak of, though after a bottle I need to take a short break. The sweetness isn't sticky like a BW, but it's definitely present.
O - I don't think I'll be seeking this (expensive) brew out in the future, but it's definitely right up there with the best of them. I will proverbially ask, "is it the best beer in the world?" The answer is clearly a subjective, "no," but it's something to seek. 1,470 charactersJamesShoemaker, Mar 21, 2013

A: Deep brown with a thin lacing that hangs around. 
S: Incomparable. The first glass was poured a few feet away from me and I could smell the aroma from there. Beautiful warm yeasty bread, rich dark fruits, plum, malt and more malt. Soft is the best word I have. I wish I could keep my nose in a glass of this all day long.
T: Follows the aroma. Complex, gorgeous, bold, but also well balanced. Heavenly.
M: Mouthfeel is great. Good, slightly high carbonation. 
O: The best beer in the world? I'm surprised to say "yes". 
We lined up two bottles of St Bernardus Abt 12 afterwards for comparison. Extremely similar but the Westy is noticeably better in almost every respect. Prior to this, the St. Bernardus Abt 12 was probably my favorite beer and I was blown away by how good the Westvleteren 12 was. I did not expect it to live up to the reputation, but it did and I'm happy to cross this off the bucket list. 991 characterswilkowski, Mar 20, 2013

4.93/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Just my opinion...I have seen the reviews of this beer fall after the sale of the gift packs in the US. I must say that those who rushed into drinking one right away missed out. I know it must have been very difficult to wait however, to let this beer ripen for a few years one would find a more earthy, well balanced flavor, without the alcohol burn at the end. I love this beer, just opened a bottle dated 14/12/14 which I bought at the Abby in 2011 and based it against one bought last month. The favors of the fruits are more pronounced/distinctive throughout. If you have any left, store it properly and let it sit for a few years, then review it again. 658 charactersMpollard, Mar 19, 2013

4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into Westy XII goblets that came with the brick - split this bottle with my brother. Cellaring the other 5 for a while. Murky, hazy brown with yellowish tan head. Familiar Belgian funk with dark fruit aroma. Tastes much the same, with plum, raisins, and yeasty spice. Perfect carbonation - less than a tripel, but still high as Belgians usually are. Perfectly balanced. I haven't had a lot of quads, but this one stands out. Pretty close to St. Bernardus 12, but has a little something extra. I'll have to A-B them sometime. 
Now if I could just get my hands on the 8 and Blonde...
Thanks to Jerry at The J Clyde for getting the brick to my family for an awesome Christmas present. 690 charactershopjake, Mar 19, 2013

A- a fig/raisin like color that is soemwhat hazy. A nice 2 finger head that is fluffy and sticky. perfect!
S- dark fruits: plums, raisins and figs. subtle caramel malts that complement the brew nicely.
F- Wow, i can see why this brewery and its beers are highly revered. This has great flavor tones of figs and raisins mixed with the malts. I have nothing bad to say. I mean it was just like a big sigh. taseful and relaxing.
M- Slightly carabonated but very very smooth and creamy. It is like eating a plum with a lil bit of brown sugar and it slides all the way down.
O- best beer i have ever had to date. World class and i am grateful i could have it. 709 charactersDodo2step, Mar 16, 2013

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Pours hazy, barely opaque chestnut color. Minimal head in this particular pour but was sharing with a friend. It has very fine bubbles that retain around the edges of the glass. 
Smell: Just the right hint of sweet with dark fruits, raisins, plums, maybe some cherry, caramel and subtle malts. 
Taste: At first sip it is clear why this was a highly renowned beer. It is complex, but perfectly balanced with just the right combination of sweet flavors that taste of dark fruits like fig or plums. There is caramel, brown sugar and a very subtle hint of spiciness at the end. There’s a pleasant warmth from the alcohol as it’s consumed. 
Mouthfeel: Moderate in body, very smooth and creamy on the palate, the oxidation sits on the tongue. The fine bubbles round out the mouth feel with perfectly balanced carbonation. 
Overall: Most anyone should be able to taste why this is one of the top beers in the world. It is complex yet perfectly balanced, has excellent flavor, and overall is one of the best beers I’ve ever tried. The drinkability is off the charts and I really wish I could say I had more than just the one bottle that I tried. I think it’s absolutely worth every penny and if I ever make it over to Belgium I’ll be making my way over to the Abbey of Saint Sixtus. 1,300 characterstastymug, Mar 15, 2013

Appearance: Pours a murky brown color with some visible yeast sediment floating in the glass. There was slightly more than a finger of a frothy light tan head with good retention and lacing.
Smell: Rum soaked dark fruits. Raisin, fig, plum, caramel, brown sugar, belgian yeast
Taste: Similar to the nose. More booze soaked raisins, fig, cherry, sweet bread, apple, yeast spice 
Mouthfeel: Lighter side of full bodied with medium carbonation. It has a soft, slightly creamy mouthfeel that's really nice. Alcohol is hidden incredibly well. Goes down so smooth.
Overall: There's no doubt this is a world class beer. I would rank this as my #1 quad. If you've never tried it, I would recommend seeking out a bottle, and maybe a couple extras to save for special occasions. With that being said, is it worth the extra money and effort it would take to obtain this on any type of semi regular basis? In my opinion, no (and I don't know that there's any beer out there that would be). 1,028 charactersJonada, Mar 12, 2013

A - Burbandy/brown. pencil thin light mocha head. constant carbonation along glass. barely opaque.
S - Chocolate, cherry, dates, carmel and boozy.
T - initially carbonation hits, cherry, dates, toffee and chocolate tones. finish is bit hoppy and pretty boozy. certainly taste the 10.2 ABVs
M - Very frothy and high carbonation. certainly not thick. almost tastes a bit thin. 
O - This is not what I was expecting at all. Much more boozy, missing the thick velvety feel. While yes, a number of complex enjoyable flavors but nothing mind blowing. Rochefort 10 & St. Bernardus abt 12, which I thought were supposed to be similar, blow this away. It is a good beer and I like it, I would order it again, but I am astounded this the 'Best Beer in the World'. I come away disappointed. 880 charactersweonfire, Mar 09, 2013

4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Scored a bottle of this recently, which was broken off the brick gift packs released earlier this year. Definitely wasn't cheap, but when is another opportunity going to come by to try this? Poured into a tulip glass out of a 11.2oz bottle. Split the costs and drinking effort with a friend. Freshness date is printed as "0/0/2015."
Since it was split, can't say much for these bottles' full potential in maintaining head, but even a half pour yielded classic results I expect in a quad. A dark-plum, brownish tone, a decent half finger of head, and wonderful sticky lacing all around. The color is not opaque, but this thing is definitely viscous with the alcohol and yeast included. Has tremendous alcohol legs, and looks delightful yet pretty much identical any great quad I've had in in the style.
The aroma is a combination of dark dried fruits, as expected, alongside grassy hop characteristics and deepened caramel notes. Plums, figs, and raisins are chock-filled here, and presented in an alcohol soaked manner. Unlike Rochefort 10, I'm not getting too much of the boozy, rum notes, and instead find myself surprised to find this to rather different, in the sense where there's a huge grain/malt character soaked with alcohol, as well as bright yeasty notes. The hoppiness really balances out things here, and makes it complex without being too overwhelming. Delightful!
The flavor takes things to an even greater level, by continuing the bright fruit and hop zest, and yet revealing the most notable aspect about this beer. Despite having tons of flavors and complexity, this is SO crisp and juicy to drink! The fruit flavors feel almost pruned and awash with full-bodied texture, as well as having a crisp graininess that resembles toasted caramel. Not too many spices here, or medicinal for that manner. Clove comes in, but it's very subtle. Syrupy yeastiness finds its way with well balanced carbonation. There's definitely a lot of heat that rises at the back of the throat with the alcohol, and the grassy hop flavors tingle the cheeks after each sip. This is ridiculously easy to drink. Can't taste the alcohol, and the ingredients all are well represented overall, each which comes in different phases during consumption.
This ever elusive, frustratingly difficult beer to obtain definitely lives up to being among the greats. If I could find a bottle for half the price I paid I definitely would get it again. All the ingredients come together beautifully and paint a portrait of what it's trying to be. However, the painting never seems to fully reveal itself in the long run, leaving much to be desired and examined by the time the final sip is made. Even if this beer were easier to find, it still would be the stuff of poets. In the end, no matter what anyone gets from this beer, it is extremely hard to deny that this is a beer made with wonderful care and passion from the monks of St. Sixtus, and represents what makes Belgian beer so unique and delicious in the beer world. Don't miss out on a chance to try this.
Update (2/10/2014): Recently got to try a non-brick bottle recently, courtesy of jdhowe. This is terrific - the aroma has been bumped up slightly, as the bottles that are exclusive to Belgium display a funky, yeasty characteristic - like a freshly cut green apple or pear. The beauty really IS in the yeast with this beer, and undeniably puts it far apart from the other Trappist beers as the dark horse of the bunch. 3,462 charactersmagictacosinus, Mar 06, 2013

Really stoked to finally try this beer! Review #500
Pours a clear and dark reddish-brown color; the last pour adds some yeast murkiness. The off-white head is huge and has a superb amount of retention and excellent lacing. Lots of bubbles are seen streaming from the bottom of the glass.
Aromas feature sweet malt and dark fruits, such as figs, dates, grapes and raisin. Other aromas include musty, oak notes and spicy yeast.
The taste is similar to the nose, starting with dark, sweet malts with hints of molasses, licorice and dark cherries. Also has a woody character to it, although the bitterness is very low if not non-existent. Other flavor notes include an acidity or tartness of tannin, as in a wine. Smooth but complex
The mouthfeel is at first dominated by the very high carbonation level, with a medium to thick body. Has a fairly potent alcohol warming presence. The finish is semi-sweet with lingering dark and ripened fruits. Tastes better as the beer warms up a bit.
Overall this was a pleasure to sip on. Is it one of the world's best beers? Not sure, but probably so; it's hard to evaluate this without being somewhat influenced by the notoriety. It's in the top ten of the 500 ones I've reviewed. Either way, I'm excited to have tried this and would recommend it heartily!

T- I didn't get much taste what so ever from this beer due to the carbonation
M- This is the part that I think completely ruined this beer for me. This beer was so heavily carbonated that it felt like it swelled in my mouth and made it hard to get down. Due to this fact I actually contemplated drain pouring, but I sucked it up and finished it.
I will try another bottle I have I don't know if this one was off or what. Once I try the other I will update my review. 493 charactersErraticToast, Mar 03, 2013

A- It pours a deep coppery brown, with light foamy head that forma a nice lace along the glass. 
S- The bouquet on this is very complex, and fantastic. Breads with dark fruits, and the alcohol jumps out at me, but not overpowering. It all blends together nicely.
T- The flavors in this are incredible, combined with strong, but not overpowering alcohol. Combines perfectly. The flavors seem to change throughout, seeming sweeter to me toward the bottom. The maltiness is nicely offset by just the right amount of bitterness to create an incredible balance.
MF- Lighter than expected, with nice carbonation. I love Quads, but this one has a different feel to it.
O- Best beer in the world? This will always be a atter of opinion and personal taste. For me, it's on of the top 2 or 3. Just a shame that more can't try this wonderful beer. 980 characterscdmillard, Mar 02, 2013

4.56/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Acquired one bottle from '12 (thanks to cneville) and one bottle from '11 (from Mike) and did a side-by-side with the '11 Westy and a St. Bernardus Abt 12 - just to see what all the fuss is about. Westy pours a murky, dark brown color that accumulates deep at the bottom with light only passing through near the top of the beer, giving it a lighter, copper color. A beige, creamy head forms but remains small, even with an aggressive pour, though it can be coaxed out easily by swirling the glass. So far, so good.
The aroma was beautiful, and in all honesty, simply everything that a Belgian strong ale should be. Raisins, figs, dates - all lightly sugar coated and soaked with a mild boozy flavor. Sweet, smooth brown sugar, faint roses, lightly toasted nuts, toffee malt, and another complex layer of booze that gets a bit stronger as the beer warms up, until it reaches a slightly phenol-like presence. Earthy and dark, fruity esters abound, along with light hints of spices and Belgian yeasty warmth. It all remains wrapped in an array of sugary and savory aromas - the nose on this is one of the most perplexing things I've come across. Just SO MANY THINGS going on, yet it all mingles so strangely well.
A heavily bread and caramel malt backbone leads the way as I take my first sip. I don't have much time to linger with that, however, because my palate is immediately thrust into a flavor profile more stunning than the aroma. Candied grapes, figs, dates, and more dark, juicy, overripe fruits. Sweet red licorice, light booze, honey, calm, earth and fruit esters, mild clove and warming spices, Belgian yeast... I could go on and on. Truth is, the flavor profile on this bad boy is truly an enigma - so many things happening and there's no way you're going to capture all of them with mere words. Some heavy bread and almost rye-like flavors in the aftertaste, buttery and smooth. Somewhat on the heavy side without being thick or syrupy; silky and smooth on the palate, very creamy and not sticky at all - decent carbonation, even for nearly two years of age.
So, is this the "best beer in the world" ? No. Well, in my opinion, anyway. BUT - I can definitely see why some people might agree with that, and I can definitely say that it deserves to be in the discussion. Even though it doesn't necessary top my list, it's certainly one of the best and most well crafted beers I've had, and no doubt a benchmark example of the style. If you love beer, do yourself a favor and seek one of these out. It was really an amazing beer, and the experience of enjoying it for yourself (or with a friend) is excellent. 2,620 characterstectactoe, Feb 27, 2013

Aroma: I smelled some copper, as well as bread, it had minerality to it, and hints of cocoa
Flavor: What stood out to me the most were the flavors of chocolate, plum, and bread. There was a sweetness that was somewhere between that of cane sugar and brown sugar. I also tasted hints of copper and cinnamon.
Mouth feel: Full body, bubbles were at a nice consistency.
Overall: Not a huge fan of Belgiums but this is a nice beer. Complex yet nicely balanced :) 547 charactersTherisse, Feb 26, 2013

Pour: A hazy, muddy brownish/deep red. A nice two and half finger head forms, and leaves some pretty nice lacing.
Smell: Big candied dark fruits up front. Definitely some plum, overripe dark cherries, and raisins. Alcohol on the finish, and a certain white grape tannic aspect on this finish. Some licorice as well.
Taste: Again, loads of overripe dark fruits: plum, cherry, raisin, and figs. Lots of chewy toffee, and a root beer like aspect. Definite alcohol heat as it finishes sticky with dark fruits.
Mouthfeel: Slightly boozy. Pretty sweet, but a lot less than I was expecting. 
Overall: Very, very good. I need to have another go around with the other quads, but I don't really think the style is my thing. Still, I can see how this might appeal to a lot of people. Either way, enjoyed this one! 863 characterscfrances33, Feb 26, 2013

Appearance - a nice dark brown, reddish, almost purple tint. Kind of the color of prune juice with some fantastic tan-brown head!
Smell - cherries, dark fruits, prunes. Bit of yeast. 
Taste - an amazing mixture of fruits. Probably my favorite Belgian offering, but not my favorite beer ever.
Mouthfeel - very smooth and refreshing.
Overall - an amazing offering! I'm so glad I was able to try this and the birth of my second son is the best reason ever to crack it open. 568 charactersBills453, Feb 25, 2013

Beer pours a dark crimson red color. Very clear. Beer poured with a strong head that is a creamy color and forms a nice lace on the glass.
Initially a lot of caramel in the aroma. A little bit of grape in the aroma, fairly clean esters. You can smell a lot of malt.
Very clean tasting, caramel, toffee, toast, vanilla. Malt is just amazing, a wonderful mixture of toast and roastedness. Reminds me of a dunkel almost with the balance between roasted smooth malt flavors. Plums, raisin, candy sugar, slight phenolic spice, maybe some clove as well.
Full mouthfeel. Very smooth and somewhat silky.
Not as complex as i expected but that is not a bad thing here. The malt just comes through very well. Little to no hops. The alcohol is not noticeable at all. 777 charactersLeeryLeprechaun, Feb 22, 2013

The pour was a medium/dark murky brown with a small (less than 1 finger) light brown fizzy head that reduced down to a thin film and small collar, which lasted throughout and had excellent sheeting of lacing.
The aroma was of a sweet dark bread malt and a bold doughy Belgian yeast with notes of toffee, chocolate, coffee, banana, dark fruit (plums, figs and dates) and a light alcohol presence.
The taste was a smooth malty sweet with just a touch of toffee and chocolate along with a nice mild roastiness early on, and then progressed with a somewhat intense yeast presence building up to a bold fruitiness and a mild alcohol ending. The flavor lasted an average duration following the swallow, and had a yeasty fruity alcohol taste that was left behind to settle in on the taste buds and lingered for a while longer.
Mouthfeel was just under medium in body with a texture that was smooth and creamy yet dry and slightly oily along with a carbonation that was tad prickly.
Overall this is a beer that comes with quite a hype, now I can say it most definitely lives up to it. It has a superb balance of flavors that I have yet to experience in any other beer. Yes, by far this is the best beer I have ever tasted. Thank God I was able to get my hands on some, for the monastery has said it will not be available again here in the US for at least 25 years (2037)...

4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Well, it's Presidents day. Reason enough to commence a Quad-off. Westy 12, Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12. All poured into identical large wine glasses at the same temp. and roughly the same age. Westy picked up fresh at 'Café In de Vrede' and the others imported to the States via normal channels. All roughly eight months old I would guess. All from single 330 ml. bottles as I dont trust the St. Bernardus 750ml. Let's let them warm up a bit before we dive in.
Which is best? Hmmm...I've had them all before but never in such tight competion. After twenty minutes at room temperature, I decide to dive in...
All three pour dark with crimson highlights. Only the Westy is clear and bright while Rochefort and St. Bernardus show a bit of haze. St. Bernardus and Westy show solid retention with Westy a bit creamier in nature. Rochefort settles out quickly yet keep a film.
Nose agains goes to Westy with a pleasant dubbel-like aroma of yeast and bready malts. Rochefort is notably more malty but then that is a bit expected given the lack of foam. St. B. is bright and yeasty but dare I say half way to Unibroue?? But not in a bad way.
All taste excellent with St. Bernardus perhaps a bit lighter in body yet equally if not more depth to be offered. Westy is perfectly balanced and comes off almost as a dryish Dubbel. Rochefort has more character and alcohol and some rich caramel and chocolate and fig that seem to ebb and flow. St. B. is creamy and smooth.
Warming brings out great character in the Westy, more caramel sweetness in the Rochefort and a bit more yeasty character in the St. Bernardus. I must say that I would have trouble distinguishing the Westy from the St. Bernardus as for yeast influence alone, but then they do have a common history. Okay, the Westy is a bit smokier, but subtle.
Overall the Westy and St. Bernardus are largely indistinguishable given the bloodlines. Again, avoid the 750 and go for the 330 as more St. Bernardus. The Rochefort is best fresh and offers amazing depth. Drink local... 2,034 charactersHalfFull, Feb 19, 2013

Bottled 2012
This beer pours a murky brown with some tea colored highlights. It is topped with less than an inch of tan head that some decent lacing.
I get aromas of dates and figs with some molasses. 
The taste is very similar to the smell. I taste dates and figs with hints of molasses and spices. 
Medium mouthfeel with a dry finish.
I am glad that I got to try this beer a couple times in my life. It is not life changing. I prefer St. Bernardus Abt 12 and Rochefort 10 to this. I am not saying it is a bad beer. I like it very much, but I see no reason to chase it when there are better options that are much easier to find. 689 charactersbuschbeer, Feb 18, 2013

Appearance: Dark muddy opaque brown. Solid 1 finger head with awesome retention and lacing. Impressive.
Smell: Raisins, figs, a little nutty, some apples, grapes, nice but not jumping out on the nose.
Taste: Right along with the nose. Raisins and figs mainly. Malty aftertaste. A little dry on the aftertaste. Alcohol is a tad evident but not displeasing.
Feel: Moderate to high carbonation, nice for the style. Really smooth. Only a little viscous, without being too syrupy. Somewhat sticky.
Overall: World-class quad. Happy to have had the opportunity to taste it. I don't think it blows all other Trapist quads out of the water, but it definitely has a stake in the "best quad in the world" contest. Hard to say it is that much better than Rochefort 10 though, so given the availability of the latter, I'm not sure it's worth the trouble and price of going after more than once. 963 charactersMCain04, Feb 06, 2013

4.22/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Pours a fierce light beige head that rises up quickly over a dark and murky chestnut brown body with hinds of red glowing from underneath. (Maroon?) As the head dissipates, it leaves a line around the top of the tulip with trails of lace lingering until the top of the retained head. After about 5-10 minutes, the head has almost entirely dissipated. 
Smell- At first, I smell banana and cloves with a hint of bread but none of this is very distinct and is very subtle. I'm quite surprised by this. Another sniff reveals the esters and spice typical of Belgian beers, followed by fruit, apple, perhaps strawberry. It is quite possible that I haven't let this warm up enough. It is probably more like 45 degrees when it should be 50-55. Is becoming fruitier but still quite vague. As it warms up, the smell is becoming stronger. It is very alcoholic. It smells of licorice. As I pour more in, banana takes over again. 
Taste- It starts with a nice tickle on the tongue and begins with sour and tart notes followed by a very astringent and fruity breadiness. It's not initially pleasant but it works for this beer. This is a beer that is definitely going to take some time to suss out. There is a lot going on here but nothing really astounds me yet. From my first two drinks, it is definitely not the best beer in the world, it might not even be in the top 20 or more. My palate is out of practice but I don't know if that is the contributing factor. Very strawberry on the front, followed by bitter cheese and alcohol heat. I think musty is a very good qualifier for its finish. As it warms, it is beginning to integrate better. Flavors like figs and cloves become more apparent. It's incredibly yeasty as well, so much so that I wonder if I might have not let the bottle stand long enough (4 or 5 days should be enough). Maybe I shook it? I have poured all but the last inch into my tulip and I'm going to pour the other inch into another glass to give it a look and a taste. I did see some yeast come out with the last ounce but not as much as I expected. It doesn't taste nearly as strong as the original glass either. It is nice and dry but halfway through this is somewhere near the bottom of a top 100 list for me. It's still a very nice beer but probably about an A-. I didn't reach any conclusions from a comparison of the majority part and the bottom inch. They taste different and there is yeast in the bottom inch. Honey and bubblegum start to make an appearance but perhaps this beer is just too new. Oh well. 
Mouth- Every enjoyable and very carbonated. It has a medium body and is textured well. The mouth feel might be one of the most delightful aspects of this beer. 
Drinkability- Very drinkable. The heat comes on a first but it subsides. The only thing stopping it from being put down quickly is the 20-25 dollar price tag.
Overall- It is a disappointment but my curiosity is settled some. I will have to try another bottle to see if my initial tasting was tainted. I will also have to get some Rochefort 10 and Bernardus Abt 12 to compare. Also, I am now reading online that I may be trying this beer “too new.” It has 14.11.15 stamped on the cap which would be November 14, 2015. A poster on Beer Advocate suggested that the bottling is three years previous to this date which would make the bottle that I'm drinking only 2 and a half months old. The ideal suggested age is 3 years. And I thought I was being impatient. 3,461 charactersartoolemomo, Feb 03, 2013

Pours with a 1 1/2 finger white head on top of a nice dark brown/purplish/redish body.
The smell is amazing, with sweet dark fruits dominating the nose.
The taste is much more complex, chocolate upfront, dark fruits in the mid-palate, and belgian yeast with smoke taking over the finish. Great beer to sip slowly, each taste is different. 
On the whole, a beer I was super excited to try, and the quality lived up to the hype. 510 charactersthebigredone, Feb 02, 2013

A: Appearance is almost a flawless dark deep hazy brown, very appealing
S: Fantastic, you've never smelled beer like this. Smell is similar to red-wine, a lot of dark fruit, fig, date, and a hint of booze. My description couldn't give it justice. 
T: This beer will not blow you away. It is not extreme or striking, but It is masterfully balanced. You get all the right flavors in the right order, with the wonderful yeast derived flavors piloting the ship the whole time while maintaining a very drinkable character.
M: Again balance like no other. Very full mouthfeel with a slight boozy trail leading into a very surprisingly clean and crisp finish. Interesting for a quad.
O: This beer succeeds where Rochefort 10 fails. 10 is a very good beer but can be a bit messy at times in the taste and feel department. But this beer fails at its whalez status. I could session this beer alll day. 939 charactersFestigio, Jan 31, 2013

Pours a dark brown fig color with a one finger off white milk curd color head. The bubbles speak to you as they settle and pop. It's funny how much attention we give to appearance, aroma, and flavor. The sound of the bubbles mid-symphony in a quiet room transports me to the abbey where these monks brew this beer and I imagine how it must transform the atmosphere of there silent fortress. 
The aroma tells a story of typical quad nuances. Milk chocolate, burnt fig, sweet date, and a hint of fresh tobacco. The flavor speaks of the same subject but with roller coaster flavor spikes and a semi-sweet yet balanced finish. The vinous notes play wonderfully with the dark malt spirit while the hops balance out the sweetness to create a marvelously crafted beer. 
Dark bread, fig paste, vanilla bean, tart cherry, green tobacco with fire on its heels converging on smoke. Those are the prominent characters in this novel of creation via traditional yet soulfully transcending ways. A delightful voyage to say the least. 1,035 charactersMarcWP, Jan 29, 2013

4.51/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz. bottle (Shelton Bros. import) poured into a chalice at a beer bar.
It has been a while since I last reviewed a beer on here, but since this has been one of my holy grails for many years, I figure I ought to review now that I've finally tried it. 
Poured a dark brown color with minimal bubbly head. Aroma of dark malts, and the tiniest hint of fruit. Taste was similar, with perhaps even less fruits, but the sweetness was balanced, I thought. Nice, solid mouthfeel.
The first time I had St. Bernardus 12 (per my review here), I enjoyed it but didn't think it was great (it is a bit more dry and less fruity than Rochefort 10) - my like it it has grown very much over the years, and to be honest, I doubt that I could tell the difference between the two if I couldn't see the bottle. Until I manage to do a side-by-side of Westy 12 and Bernardus 12, I'll side with the assertions that these are effectively the same beer.
While an excellent beer, I have no interest in trying this again until I manage to visit the brewery. For the outrageous price of $40, I could have enjoyed the same experience with a bottle of St. Bernardus 12 six times over... 1,162 charactersmithrascruor, Jan 28, 2013

A: Light brown/ amber color with thick very light brown/ almost white foamy top.
S: Strong floral aromas with citrus and lemon; passionfruit, tropical fruit.
T: A complex flavor that starts with milk chocolate, then switches to a malty belgian white flavor with citrus, bitterness and a lemony sour finish. There is also a smokey flavor too. Finally, there is a peppery spice that permeates the entire taste.
M: Heavy-bodied, medium carbonation, medium-high acidity, not that bitter. Very smooth.
O: "The flavor of a quad without the cloying"; "complex flavor"; "fruity like a Belgian white, but the feel of a triple or a quad", there is a lot going on with this beer. The flavor starts with a creamy chocolate/ coffee and ends with a sour lemon bite. It was excellent. I enjoyed it tremendously. 853 charactersSlothB77, Jan 27, 2013

A: Pours a dark amber color with a two finger head and a little lacing.
S: Dark fruits, apple, and a little alcohol.
T: Sweet dark fruits, nuts, yeast, and a touch of alcohol. Hides the alcohol pretty well for a 10.2% beer. Pretty damn easy to drink.
M: Medium to heavy bodied with good carbonation. 
O: This is a pretty enjoyable beer. It's fairly complex, easy to drink, and it hides the alcohol well. I'm glad I got to try it, but I wouldn't put forth the effort to get another bottle. It's not one I'd wait in line for. 567 charactersnUgZ, Jan 27, 2013

Only the Sint Bernardus 12 seems to be close. The taste is very full and has a kind of wooden taste. The Westvleteren 8 is absolutely more fruity, but less exceptionnal. 
I absolutely recommend the beer and the website that helped me to get the beer for a good price (even if i don't know if this is allowed in my review: http://westvleteren12.webs.com/ )

4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A- Dark brown color with ruby-red hues in it. Tan, effervescent 1 inch head popped up with an aggressive amount of fizz. The head seemed a bit too watery for me. Basically, I expected more of a fluffy, sturdy head. The head is my one mark-down on appearance. 
S- Spice notes, with vanilla, brown sugar and clove.Fairly phenolic. Very small notes of fig.Aroma isn't as bold as the taste, but it is consistent and nice. 
T- Ok, here we have something special. Deep roast caramel malty flavors, brown sugar, vanilla, clove and allspice, burnt marshmallow,and dried fig are all present. Sweetness that is almost like a Dr. Pepper (in the best way possible). Aftertaste is dark dried cherries and a hint of vanilla. Warm hints of booze matched with strong phenols and a very dry finish make this one of the best tasting, most complex beers out there. 
M- Fairly full-bodied, really nice. 
O- This is a solid, solid, beer. I am very glad to have tried it, and the taste really is world class. Some of the subtleties of this beer just can't be found anywhere else. With that being said, I don't think I would constantly hunt this beer down or seek it out. Given another chance, I would love to drink it, but the money and effort are at the far end of my tolerance for acquiring beer, when something like St. Bernadaus 12 or Chimay 12 is readily available. With all of that said- I would still have to concur that this is the King of Belgian beer. 1,443 charactersIPA4LIFE, Jan 24, 2013

A: Pours a dark, mildly hazy brown color. The rocky, off-white head rises at least four fingers atop the glass, even on a pour of average strength. The head is quite persistent, and a thick crown remains as long as there is beer in the glass. Lacing consists of a single jagged ring and the odd patch here and there.
S: Very fruity on the nose with aromas of fig, date, plum, pear, and bruised apples. Complex yeasty scents. Nutty, earthy, slightly musty, hint of leather. Brown cocoa and bread crust. Very restrained whiff of spicy alcohol. Subtle cracked pepper and spice. 
T: Treacle, brown sugar, molasses, dark caramel. Slight phenolic edge brings peppery and spicy tastes. Subtle earthy/herbal hop character. Dried figs, dates, and rum-soaked golden raisins. Honeyed sweetness. Earthy, musty, and nutty yeast. Spicy alcohol is barely noticeable toward the back end. Drying finish of brown cocoa and fading yeasty spice.
M: Moderately heavy in body. Mouth-filling, creamy, lush, and ridiculously smooth. Carbonation caresses the palate and scrubs and lifts subtly and seamlessly. Warming in the mouth and in the pit of the stomach. This might possibly be the best mouthfeel I've ever experienced.
O: So this is Westvleteren 12, perhaps the most elusive and highly rated beer on the planet. I must say, its reputation is certainly deserved. This beer is a work of seamless balance and grand complexity. It just feels more focused and more refined than any other beer within the style, and it may well be the most drinkable beer of its size. There are those within the style that draw very close comparisons, and some may even have a slight edge in terms of complexity and depth of flavor. However, it's the balance and sheer drinkability that set Westvleteren 12 apart and make it worthy of its place among the world's elite beers. 1,980 charactersryan1788a5, Jan 23, 2013

A: Pours a deep amber color, a tad lighter than expected for the style. Three fingers of foam developed quite quickly, a bit prickly, but with pretty good retention. Lacing is good.
S: Spices are most evident in this beer, moreso than I'm used to for the style - orange bitters, licorice, and cardamom. A strong, malty sweetness helps balance this spiced aroma with prunes and plum. Very well balanced.
T: Sweeter than expected from the aroma, I get a strong plum flavor to start. Prunes quickly come in after that with a fairly strong caramel sweetness. The caramel and dark fruits play well off each other. The spiciness from the aroma is also in the flavor, balancing the sweetness. I get mostly cardamom with a bit of peppercorn.
M: Medium bodied for the style with slightly stronger than average carbonation. This beer was very easy to drink.
O: This beer was consumed in about ten minutes. Even while reviewing, it just went down so quickly, even while picking out all the complexities present. This is a complex, yet quaffable beer that begs you to keep drinking more. Good thing I have three more on order. 1,196 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Jan 18, 2013

Looks to be one of the brick box ones that were sent to the U.S., given the gold writing on the bottle. Having this as I brew my first beer ever. Hoping that I will get some good vibes in my wort! Pours deep murky brown with fluffy light kahki head. A bit of reddish hue on the edges. Smells of figs, plums, pears, raisin, light alcohol, bit of bready nuttiness. Flavor is slight bitter up front that explodes into chocolatey fig and white grape. Some nutty bite going on as it mellows into a fruity sweetness. More carbonation than I expected, but still chewey mouthfeel. Lasting bouquet of fruit. So glad I got to try it. 671 charactersBMMillsy, Jan 16, 2013

A: Pours a medium-dark, dull coffee brown with a finger of sand colored head. Pretty good clarity, excellent retention and lacing.
S: Vanilla/cream and red and dark fruits (black cherry, plum) and mild caramel in the secondary. Lots of fruit but it's in balance. Almost candyish.
T: Rich, delicious red and dark fruit, finishing with mild bitterness, sweet malt, and a little booze. Really clean, balanced flavor makes this very drinkable.
M: Creamy texture, medium body and medium-high carbonation.
O: Very drinkable, nice complexity. Its excellence is not in being barrel aged, loaded with hops, or 14%, but in a superb balance and flavor. 715 characterspmarlowe, Jan 15, 2013

The smell of this brew was of candied apples, figs, and a backnote of a sweet dessert wine.
Like the smell, there is a sweet dessert wine flavor, a sweet hint of alcoholic heat, and deep candied figs and apricots. The carbonation lends a peppery quality to the taste. There is a sweetness in the background. Though this is a pretty serious beer, it isn't terribly heavy in texture. 558 charactersMrHassellYaHurd, Jan 14, 2013

S: Earth and prunes with a little spiciness.
T: Rich and earthy with tons of dark fruit and deep complex Belgian sugar flavor. The warmth from alcohol is present and blends nicely with the depth for flavor for a pleasant mind dulling enjoyment. 
M: Medium to heavy in body with a good dose of carbonation. This is my one complaint as it hides the flavor and took a few sips to adjust to the fizziness. Carbonation with fruitiness initially gave me an initial perception of a carbonated wine.
O: This definitely lives up to the hype. I am not disappointed at all. I have one more bottle so will probably refine this when I break it open. 713 charactersHiGravShawn, Jan 13, 2013

Poured from a 330mL bottle into a tulip glass.
A: Pours a beautiful garnet color with a deep red hue. A one finger, pearl white head sits on to and reduces to a thin film across the top after a few minutes. Some spotted lacing is left behind. 
S: A wonderful blend of dark fruits (blackberries, raspberries, and dark cherries) come through initially. There is significant sweetness, along with a nice caramel malt backbone.
T: Very similar to the aroma with a blast of sweet Belgian sugar, blackberries, raspberries, and cherries. It ends with a slight alcohol finish.
M: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Finishes a little hot, but the sweet dark fruits keep you coming back.
O: This definitely lives up to the hype. I am not disappointed at all. Glad I was able to try it, now I must get more. 869 charactersBilbosNuts, Jan 12, 2013
4.35/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52012 Bottle, drinking out of the chalice:
Appearance: Dark brown with an off-white head that has some staying power. Definitely looks unfiltered with some nice yeast chunks swirling around like snow in a globe.
Smell: Booze, brown sugar, dark fruit, raspberries and some biscuity aroma.
Taste: Definitely in line with the nose. Brown sugar paired with dark fruit up front, with some berry and red wine notes that give way to a bread biscuit middle. This all fades out into the smoothest of finishes that kind of just sees everything decrescendo into a pleasant bready finish, that leaves you longing for the next sip. There is some booze noticeable in the middle/end depending on how you drink, but it's nothing overbearing and definitely far from harsh.
Mouthfeel: Not too much, not too little. Just right for this gravity and lends to the "drinkability" *cringe.*
Overall: Don't know if it lives up to the godly hype(what beer can?) but make no mistake, this is a balanced, delicious beer with a great flavor profile that didn't disappoint me. 1,050 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Jan 12, 2013

Cap date: 29.10.05
A: Pours a murky brown and tan with a thin ring of pure white head around the edges of the glass. The foam ring lingers for as long as the beer is in the glass. There is no lacing as it drinks.
S: The nose is quite interesting. I get alcohol burn, berry notes, malt, and sugar. To be perfectly honest... it smells like some sort of cough syrup.
T: This beer tastes like moldy berries, soaked pumpernickel bread, rock candy, and booze. 
M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet to start and cloying.
O: I know this beer has a huge claim to fame, but I'm just not a fan. I have had this many times in the past year, in a bunch of different vintages, and I remain firm on my ranking. I just don't like it. I don't understand all the hype. I can only trust my taste-buds. What I will say, is that I like this beer much better when it is fresh. This particular bottle has 10+ years on it. 942 characterstrxxpaxxs, Jan 11, 2013

Gold/brown body with thick tan head. Has a sweet and spicy smell with matching flavor that pops while going down. Does not go down smooth but doesn't really need to considering this is one that you will sip slow.
Overall this beer is better than average and has a lot of flavor that will get better with age. 387 charactersSpectre, Jan 11, 2013

Served in an Olde Hickory shaped glass.
A: Rich, caramel brown red, with tons of yeasties suspended in what looked like dirty gelatin. The frothy, mocha head didn't go anywhere throughout the entire session Gorgeous!
S: So complex. First and foremost, it smells like a red wine through and through. It's not the usual blend of dark fruit such as plums, figs, and brown sugar. This is much brighter. I got grapes, Sweet Tarts, currants, and maybe a mild undertow of figs.
T: A bit more beer-like in its flavor, not in the least bit overly sweet, and still with a nice red wine bill. The aftertaste is smooth and silky at first, but then of bit of boozy bitterness slaps the palate. For some reason, I get a good bit of apple flavor here as well. Remarkable!
M: Creamy and scrumptious, not sweet or cloying, and with a near perfect carbonation bill. The bitterness was played with a steady hand and I'm still in awe of how they got that element of this brew pitch perfect. The lacing left on the glass was ridiculous.
O: They don't call this the "World's Best Beer" for nothing. With out a doubt, the most remarkable quad to ever hit my palate. Sensational! 1,256 charactersChaney, Jan 09, 2013

I at first wanted it to be awful so I didn't have to keep driving over and getting some, but unfortunately I was wrong. The hype is true. Pours a nice dark caramel/toffee color. Bit khaki head that slowly falls and leaves plenty of lacing behind. The smell is a nice blend of caramel, vanilla, figs, raisins, malt, molasses, and dried black cherries. The taste is just as complex and leaves nothing to be desired. A nice sweetness in the finish and it leaves you wanting, craving, more. World class beer. 595 charactersIggsRay, Jan 08, 2013

The smell is wonderful. Lots of sweetness, dark fruits, like a typical Trappist beer, but this one overwhelms the senses in so many way. 
Lots of breadiness and sweetness on the palette. A fantastic array of dark fruits, caramel malts, vanila, apple. Lots of spices. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and this is crazily drinkable!

Trappist Beer Night! 
The Granddaddy of Them All: Westie 12. Hype and Expectation vs. Substance and Quality. This beer, quite likely, had to overcome the highest expectations of any beer I have ever had. Ever. Heck, we paid $28 for one bottle. This one had better blow my socks off, pick them up, throw them in the laundry with the whites, rinse, dry, press, and return to my calloused feet before I would be impressed (proverbially speaking, that is).
Short story: It impressed. Oh, how it impressed!
Big, rich, brie cheesy. Like opening a barn door on a dairy farm. Yeast jumping out of the bottle. Musky and manure-y. (Yes, that kind of manure.) Creamy, yet crisp. Complex flavors of dark fruits and figs. An aftertaste of aged red wine. Edgy, but not confrontational. Subtle and smooth, yet not without a wild streak. The Quad of Quads and Trappist of Trappists!
The Legend of the XII Lives. Long Live Westie 12. 949 charactersbrewsclues, Jan 05, 2013
4.38/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a westvleteren XII gold rimmed chalice. Huge thanks to my friend Adam for giving me this bottle, glass, and another bottle... Which I have yet to open. Everything is from one of the 12.12.12 bricks.
A: pours a deep nutty looking murky brown with a slight hint of ruby... With a gentle pour I get a creamy looking finger of slightly browned head that's dissapates to a thick film and remains forever, the retention is excellent.... Very nice lacing all the way down the glass as well.
S: at first I got a very very lightly toasted, brown breadiness... Then the sweetness stepped in, apple, caramel, toffee, raisin, plum... Smells nice 
T: yum. Again right up front I notice a bit of breadyness that is quickly washed over with sweetness, caramel, toffe, apple, raisin, fig, vanilla, deffiantly sugary. The alcohol is there bit very well hidden at the same time. Then on the finish I get the lightly toasty breadyness again along with honey and more sweetness... 
M: very very nice, medium body, with lush creamy carbonation which is at the same time also slightly stinging on the tounge... Velvety, creamy and lush... There is a bit of a lingering sweet aftertaste, where at the very end I find a sweet nutty chocolate note 
O: this is a great beer... Would i call it the best beer in the world? No. Bit it is certainly damn good, particuarly for its style. It is a tad on the sweet and sugary side I would say. But very nice balance and flavor, along with the amazing mouthfeel put this amongst the elite few. 1,548 charactersPeterIngemi, Jan 05, 2013

Good dark appearance with a thin off-white head. Lighter than most quads but rich.

Taste is the same. Very smooth and blended. No particular taste stands out. Very balanced.

First reaction, pop the cap, smells like barn doors just swung open and the combination of decadent material with hay had me at hello. This may sound like a terrible description, but it was the happiest I have ever been to be overtaken with the smell of a farm. 
This beer hit like a delicious piece of bread lightly buttered and rich in organic material. Totally satisfied, worth the wait and price. I am tired of being laughed when I call around to find it, however.

4.58/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Westy Wednesday! Had to make this my first review of 2013! 2011 bottle poured into a goblet.
Looks like the prototypical dark Belgian - dark ruby red/brown, 2 fingers of light tan head, decent legs and nice lacing all the way down the glass.
Aroma is just like a spiced caramel apple up front. Clove, slight banana, cinnamon, nutmeg. Even deeper earthy spices like anise and black pepper, tobacco, dark candi sugar. Dark fruit, figs, black currant, and more.
The perfect dessert beer. Lots of figgy pudding and cake like spice, raisin, a bit of cacao, caramel, pear, honey, candi sugar, molasses, toffee, bready malt. The richest and most layered beer I've ever had, certain flavors I can't even describe. A bit of heat distracts at the back of the palate.
This is what really sets this apart from other quads. Rich and slightly slick but sits just enough on the finish to match the rich spice and fruit, satisfying almost like spiced bread pudding and coffe cake.
Hard to deny that it's one of the best beers I've ever had. It really feels like liquid bread or a dessert - really satisfying but I could only have one every once in a while. But if I could I would definitely have it a few times a year. Absolutely delicious, and a great start to 2013. 1,256 charactersafrokaze, Jan 02, 2013

4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottled March 9, 2009.
Pours a semi-hazy dark brown color with a fairly large bubbly tan head that recedes to leave some solid lacing.
Aromas begin with an intense amount of dark raisin fruitness and caramelized sugars. As it warms you get some candy and lesser molasses notes. But the real standouts are the dark fruits consisting of dark cherries, plums, figs, and dates.
The tastes follow the nose with inital caramelized maltiness with an underlying toasted crackery maltiness. It is fairly sweet malt forward with some caramel, molasses and toffee. Once again there are strong flavors of dates and figs with some raisins and prunes as well.
The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium with a perfect amount of carbonation (on the heavier side) that is standard in high quality, well-made Trappist beers.
Overall I was really really really impressed with this beer. After hearing for years that a Rochefort 10 is equally on par with this if not better, I have to say that I do not agree. Maybe it is the age that made this one so special and tasty but I remember being really unimpressed with the Rochefort 10 I had around a year ago. This reminds me agreat deal of the St Bernardus 60th Anniversary beer which I previously thought was the best Belgian beer I have ever had. I would have liked to sample this next to that one to really see who is tops and I will revisit a Rochefort 10 I have been aging as well in a year to see if my memory/opinions will change but I cannot say enough about this beer right now, it was quite special indeed. 1,554 charactersclaspada, Jan 02, 2013
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Got my brick on 12-12-12 and tried one on Christmas Day. Now it's time for a review. First off, I had this accompanying dinner. First a prime rib and second a lobster tail and filet. It was a perfect pairing.
A- Actually, nothing too special. Poured into the tasting glass that came with the brick and I tried very hard to get a luxurious head but it produced a moderate foamy head that lasted a minute or so. Great lacing down the glass. Medium dark clear reddish brown color.
S- Incredibly complex from plain carmel maltiness to brown bread, raisins, chocolate, vanilla and licorice.
T- Everything in the nose is here. It starts sweet and runs through the complex flavors suggested in the aroma. There is slightly bitter finish that balances the sweetness. Over all there is a malty quality that holds it all together.
M- I finally get what they mean by the term "digestible". This packs huge flavor and a good alcohol punch without being heavy or cloying. Medium body, ultra smooth and perfectly carbonated.
O- The best quad/strong dark I have had so far. Last time I finished the bottle with some dark chocolate cheesecake. Not a good match. This seems to go better with savory foods. Something that is very sweet will cancel out the complexity of this amazing beer. 1,275 charactersmschind, Jan 02, 2013

I have had the Westvleteren Blue Cap and Yellow Cap twice before in a bar, but never have I "owned" these coveted beers, and I must admit that I have taken them out of the fridge a few times to just hold them and comfort them prior to my indulgence. So now is the time to cut open the hype, and to determine whether this really is "the best beer in the world"? Is there such a thing as "the best beer in the world", any more than than the existence of the "best sex in the world"? Let's see . . . . 
Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle (10.02.15 date) into the gift pack chalice, after being stored at 51F in my wine cabinet all day and then sitting out at room temp for about 15 minutes. (I'm pretty sure I drank my first one last night too cold.).
A: Pours a medium mahogany / teak color which is more transparent than other quads I have had. Despite visible clumps of dark yeast coming out in the pour, the beer is not overly cloudy in the glass, but is almost burgundy around the edges. The chunky head dissipated pretty quickly and left no lacing whatsoever, a bit of a disappointment, pours like an undercarbonated Coke.
N: The nose is appealing and complex, but much more subdued than I would have expected. Relatively boozy smelling, with vanilla , apple and fig ester smells the predominant notes, backed up by a strange, though not un-appealing buttery woody aroma and the ever so slightest rucola mediciny smell.
T: Bready and malty biscuit foundation with sweet toffee, caramel and fruity notes. The more it opens up, the buttery flavors and the sweetness comes through more prominently with a cola / prune / vanilla flavor which for some reason reminds me of Dr Pepper (not a bad thing.) The taste profile is definitely complex and quite enjoyable and I got almost no warming alcohol burn. One of the more subtle quads I have ever had.
MF: This is where the Westvleteren Cistercians excel, both in the Dubbel and the Quad. The mouthfeel is just so smooth, sensual and enjoyable. The mouthfeel is much more carbonated than the beer appears in the glass, but it's almost velvety in texture.
In summary, is this a great beer? Yes. Is it the best beer in the world? For me, probably not. Like sex, everything is relative and everyone is entitled to their opinion. I've had beers that I enjoyed better, but I just slept with a super model, so I'm gonna gloat for a while. 2,521 charactersJeffreyJDavis, Jan 01, 2013

A: Poured dark mahogany brown with a reddish tint, and a one finger head that slowly dissipated. Fair amount of lacing.
S: Fruits like plums and dates, sweet sugar, roasted malts.
T: Roasted malt, sugar, plum, dates, cherries. A nice underlying spiciness with flavors like clove and allspice.
M: Big body but not overly thick, fair amount of carbination, coats the palate nicely.
O: A very nice quad. The first couple of sips had me worried that it was going to be average, but it really improved by the time i finished it. I think it will benefit from some aging. Planning on spreading the other 5 bottles over the course of a few years. 753 charactersrichj1970, Jan 01, 2013

Glass: Trappist glass 
From: Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, Calif. 
Price: $84.99 for 6-pack + two glasses (also had to purchase $50 worth of stuff at HWC) 
Misc.: Bottle cap and part on bottle said best by Jan. 8, 2015; The only time this beer has been in the U.S. and supposedly the only time it will be.
Poured a mahogany color with about a finger of off-white head that stayed forever on the top of the beer. Great thick and milky lacing on the sides. Great retention all the way down.
Smelled sour fruit up, followed by a sweet tarty flavor. Got green apple and kiwi. Also some malt backbone to it, mainly toasty caramel and toffee. Some light chocolate, too? Got better as I sat and smelled it.
Tasted similar to the nose. Just so damn smooth. Definitely could taste the alcohol up front. Some cloves, which I didn’t get in the smell. Got the green apple and tartness. Also light hints of caramel, honey
Medium body. Thin texture. Soft (below average) carbonation. Long, smooth finish.
An obviously fantastic beer. Like Frank the Tank in “Old School” said, “Once it hits your lips, it’s so good.” One of the smoothest beers I’ve ever tried. 1,190 charactersBucannonXC5, Jan 01, 2013
4.12/5  rDev -10.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to Craig for the trade. Poured just before midnight on Dec. 31, 2012. Poured into a North Coast snifter (1/2) and a tulip glass (1/2). Had a St. Bernardus Abt 12 ready to go for comparison's sake. Bottle cap says 02.09.14.
First scent: beery, almost cola-ish, sweet. Pours ruby. Fizzy head. Scents of dried fruit, apple, yeasty.
First sip: brighter than expected, effervescent, full bodied but not oily or round. Beery/fruity up front, woody carmelly finish. THat's the first sip.
Later sips: cola notes again, but really a planty/woody flavor in the middle -- not something I'm used to in a beer. Expected it would be sweeter. Very long finish with alcohol and wood. Almost a mineral quality to the finish. 
The bottom of the bottle poured noticeably cloudy and had slightly more body to it. 
The Bernardus is almost exactly the same color. Bernardus has more of an apple scent, less of a dark dried fruit. Bernardus might be a little sweeter. Less wood. Bernardus might have a shorter finish. 
All in all, a good quad. If I didn't know it was "the best beer in the world," I might not have figured it out by what's in the glass. It is very good, but I think a lot of its reputation is self-fulfilling. Would buy again if I could. 1,249 charactersmmapes, Jan 01, 2013

Its a good beer, but not super amazing. I am going to set a couple back and try them again in one year intervals to see if they improve, but at this point, given the price I wouldnt buy this beer again. I'm tempted to sell a couple to recoup my cost.
S- dried fruits a bit of alcohol. Same for tne flavor. 
M- a bit thin and more carbonation than expected .

Dates, brown sugar, caramel, notes of maple, and very light bourbon without the alcohol on the nose. The moutfheel is medium- to full-bodied and lightly oily. A bit of carbonation on the rear of the tongue. Nutty up front, caramel apple appears shortly after. Alcohol warmth shows up late and lingers in the throat. Some alcohol bitterness appears as well. So much balance from start to finish in all aspects of the beer. The only drawback is the cutoff at the finish by the alcohol bitterness. 577 charactersDocJitsu, Jan 01, 2013

A - dark brown with a slight amber hue; huge, soft, thick, foamy, brownish head that has tremendous retention
S - alcohol, baked apples, sweet, sugary
T - baked apples, caramel, sugar, warming alcohol, raisins, figs, a bitter finish
M - warm, full bodied, crisp, well carbonated
I have to say that this did not live up to the hype for me. I think had this been fresh it would have been exceptional. As it stands it is a good beer, but certainly not perfect. The flavors did not all come together for me. They all seemed to be disjoint. The baked apples are the dominant flavor followed by caramel and sugar. The dark fruits come in the finish. Don't get me wrong. This is a tremendous beer and it is definitely worth trying if you can find it, but ultimately there are equally good Quads available that are much easier to find. 880 characterstdm168, Dec 31, 2012
4.3/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this on 2012-12-23 in Lititz, PA from the special brick released on 2012-12-12.
A - Ruby-brown with a 1-finger tan head and sticky lacing.
S - Glazed biscuit, dark cherry, semi-sweet cocoa, mild spice. Not real strong.
T - Somewhat tart cherry, sweet raisin, plum, earthy spice, good amount of roasted malt, light toffee, citrus. Quite dry. Finishes more bitter than I expected. 
M - Medium body and quite a bit of carbonation. Smooth, syrupy, 
O - A fine beer. We had this at our Christmas party and everyone enjoyed it; some more than others of course. After tastings of the (arguably) top four Belgian Quads, I would rate them in this order for my personal taste preference:
1 = Pannepot
2 = Westvleteren XII
3 = Rochefort 10
4 = St. Bernardus Abt 12.
Of interest, my wife would rate them in this order:
1 = St. Bernardus Abt 12
2 = Pannepot
3 = Westvleteren XII
4 = Rochefort 10
Quads aren't my favorite style, but I/we enjoyed everything about this beer and the others mentioned above. It was worth the drive to Maryland and the long wait in line to score, share and taste this well-regarded brew. 1,115 charactersTucquan, Dec 31, 2012

A- pours a dark brown with a good amount of reddish tint, a nice slightly off-white one finger head appears and slowly dissipates to a nice covering, fairly good amount of lace sticks to the glass
S- molasses, burnt sugar, dark fruits like figs and raisins, sweet candi sugar, slightly fruitiness from the belgian yeast, smells incredible
T- Burnt sugar, raisins, cherries, lightly bitter hop aftertaste which is surprising, dark malt, sugary sweetness is mixed in, fruity belgian yeast notes, a little bit of nutmeg, alcohol is fairly present
M- heavy body but not overly thick, high carbonation, slick over the palate
O- this is a very good quad, however I definitely think it could benefit from some aging which is why I'm glad I split my gift pack with a buddy and have two more bottles, I'd like to see the alcohol subside slightly, other than that a solid beer even if it is a little over-hyped in my opinion 964 charactersnova009, Dec 31, 2012

Poured in it's own branded goblet. From one of the gift packs brought to North America this year. Purchased at Sherbrooke Liquor in Edmonton. Special thanks to my buddy Scott for the hook up!
Reddish-brown in colour and hazy. Beige head is 1/8 inch on the pour but recedes to a few islands and a ring around the outside. Spots of lace here and there.
Aroma is sweet, boozy and vinuous. Reminds me a little of wine or port. Dried fruit. Almost like a fruit cake.
Reminiscent of drinking champagne. Lots of tiny pin prick bubbles. Strong boozy kick in the pants right off the start. Hints of dried fruit, fruit cake. Fruit cake mixed with champagne. 
Quite unlike anything I've had before. As much as the alcohol is very prevalent, it's not at all overpowering nor does it have that alcohol burn. Complex, subtle, sweet, tart, bubbly, boozy, smooth. The one thing that amazes me, is the mouthfeel. If I didn't know it was a beer, I'd swear it was a sparkling wine. I can't say it's the best beer I've ever had, or my favourite, but it's probably the most unique and pleasurable in it's own way. Not something I'd want to drink every day, but a rare treat. 1,253 charactersNoxious26, Dec 30, 2012

S. That is a beautiful smell. Dry fruit and sugar. Alcohol.
T. Holy shit, that is a magnificent beer. There's a nice hoppy bitterness underneath, a raisin and dark fruit taste. A bit of a brown sugar taste. Malty. So complex and flavorful.
M. Carbonated and tingly on the tongue. Medium bodied.

Aromas of brown sugar, cherries, basement, bread. Tart cherry really comes through.
A lot going on with the taste. Bread and brown sugar heavy up front which transitions to toffee and dark fruits. Spicy, bitter, and dry in the back end with some nice warming. Not overly hot and silky smooth.
The feel is extremely soft with some drying in the end. It's like diving into a pool of cool whip, being pulled out by angels, and the dried with a sherpa cloth.
What a wonderful treat brought back from Belgium by my sister and bro-in-law. Merry Christmas! Thoroughly enjoyed! 656 charactersTCgoalie, Dec 29, 2012

I also purchased a St. Bernardus Abt 12 and a Rochefort 10 for comparison purposes. From my notes, this one prevails as the best of the three:
Pours dark brown with a pillowy, beige head that fades to a foam atop the ale. Aromas are pleasant and come through more as the ale warms: musty, boozy, earthy, sweet, caramel, honey, fruity as it warms w plum & cherry. Tastes are boozy, rich, sweet, malty, fruity with plum, raisin, currant, rum, bready yeast, mossy, musty, earthy - great complexity! Mouth-feel is full bodied with lots of carbonation, very smooth. Overall, it lives up to its expectations. I had my doubts, but it came through...maybe even better than expected. 763 charactersbarnzy78, Dec 26, 2012

4.4/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a nice mahogany brown with a fluffy off white head. Very obviously well carbonated. Looks thinner than I thought it would as it pours out of the bottle. Nice looking beer.
Smell is a little bit of alcohol up front, followed by some sweetness and dark fruit. No real hop presence. Smell is pleasant but not an overwhelming or out of the ordinary smell for the style.
Taste is dark fruit up front, followed by brown sugar and then a slight lingering tartness. Not much of any ligering aftertaste, no real bitterness. Drinks a little hot as it warms up. A very pleasant flavor profile with no one note really overpowering.
Mouthfeel is probably the best i've had in this style. Full carbonation but not foamy. Very smooth and easy to drink despite the large flavor profile. Still a sipper for sure, but it never becomes harsh.
Hard to grade this beer impartially given all the anticipation and the amount of time it spent at the top of the top beers list. For the style, this is marginally the best example i've had. For me, though, it doesn't transcend the style or make me think of quads any differently than I did beforehand. It is worth seeking out if you can get it and are a fan of the style in general. For the price point though, i'd rather buy rochefort going forward, even if I prefer this by a slight margin. 1,326 charactersmechamifune, Dec 26, 2012

11.2 oz bottle poured into a Hair of the Dog tulip, cap dated 26.09.15 - this is an unmarked bottle and not the recent US release. This bottle sent to me by Curtis McArthur (thanks man!) and reviewed from notes.
A: Careful pour yields a ton of off-yellow head that has good substance and sticks around forever; it looks like a root beer float head. Body is darker opaque brown/prune colored with gold highlights at the stem of the glass. Carbonation is still rising ten minutes after the initial pour, streaming up the side of the glass. I'm intrigued - this thing is beautiful.
S: Instant fruitiness, darker in essence; grapes upfront with some suggestions of apples, prunes, plums, and raisins. Maltiness is apparent, and sweeter Belgian candy sugar rises, with hints of caramel as well. Brilliant smell.
T: Follows the nose, with a more subdued sweetness. A touch of a chalky yeast character distracts slightly. Moderate fruitiness again with the slightest sensation of holiday and baking spices; apples and raisin bread, faint caramel drizzle. Dessert, and bready malt; on the sweeter side. Carbonation cleans the palate and the flavors meld harmoniously. Very nice.
MF: Thinner medium body with a dancing carbonation presence that isn't distracting. Just a touch of an alcohol bitterness.
O: Fabulously done Quad. Right up there with Abt. 12, though I believe Abt 12 tasted better to my palate, with more caramel-apple dessert notes. Overall I can see why this is such a sought after beer. This also seems to be an excellent age for this beer. 1,569 charactersScotchboy, Dec 26, 2012

A - a rich deep dark red brown with a perfect 1-1/2" head that slowly dissipates to a nice thin cap. slight to average lacing. 
S -sweet smelling maltiness with omnipresent fruit consisting of fig, dates, and raisins. the Belgian yeast aromas are just what i was expecting.
T -wow, just wow. perfect balance between the sweetness of a Quad but with a dry and slightly bitter aftertaste. the fruits, especially the fig and raisin aromas are released the warmer the beer gets. As the beer warms up to 55* it gives a warm glow on the finish, just amazing.
M - the carbonation is perfect for the full body. extremely drinkable. A slight warming as it goes down, but expected for the alcohol content.
O - this beer definitely lives up to the hype. Have now tried all the Trappist top ABV brews and this is by far head and shoulders above. The balance is perfect and the expected Belgian Quad characteristics are in perfect harmony. Everybody's tastes are different, but for me, this is a Benchmark brew. 1,071 charactersDocrock, Dec 26, 2012
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is it. Review #2,000! Here's to 2,000 more!
Pours a mild brown with a thick frothy head into my tulip. It did foam up initially, which required a bit of patience to subside.
Apple, cherry, fig and grapeskin notes all come flying at my nose. It makes a pretty damn good statement from first sniff!
It starts off strong and tart but then mellows toward the back. Cherry, plum and apple dominate the palate. 
It has just the right amount of tartness too. It finishes dry too and with little of the alcohol heat from upfront. Leaves a chewy texture on the tongue. 
I can't think of a better beer to celebrate nearly 6 years of beer advocacy than to review a beer that has consistently proven its' mettle in the BA Top 100. 728 charactersBrad007, Dec 26, 2012
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance- Burnt-orange brown with lacey retention after initial finger of head.
Smell- Dark fruits (black currant, plum) but not incredibly stong, even after warming up.
Taste- Complex as a Trappist monk. Sweet on the tip of the tongue with a warm middle. A little note of alcohol warmth but well hidden. The dark fruits now come out with greater intensity and phenols from the yeast's work let it be known.
Mouthfeel- Big, smooth, but a little bright alcohol is noticed in the back of the mouth.
Overall- It's a big beer but expertly well-rounded. There's a reason why people have hyped this. 599 charactersSark, Dec 26, 2012

4.4/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2oz bottled Feb 10, 2012. XII version from the US gift set. Served at cellar temperature. Enjoyed on Christmas Day 2012.
Pours clear dark brown with red highlights and an active one finger light tan head that recedes to a small cap, but doesn’t leave much lacing. (not much room for lacing in the tiny Westy XII glass included with the set).
Aroma is dark fruits, cherries, alcohol, belgian yeast, bread, brown sugar, red wine characteristics. Good to very good strength. This glass isn’t very good for capturing aromas...will try second half pour in a snifter or tulip.
Flavor is big overripe dark fruits, cherries, figs, plums, belgian yeast, rich bread, toward the finish some chocolate notes come up and more really dark fruits such as raisins, dates and figs, brown sugar. Some alcohol burn in the middle and finish, but not too bad. Moderate sweetness. Extremely complex.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sharp, fizzy carbonation, somewhat sticky. As it warms to room temp the mouthfeel completely changes, much more full bodied, super creamy, soft carbonation, wonderful.
My Christmas treat! This has always been way high on my wants, but never had much chance to try this...heard about the gift sets coming to the US and even then it was dicey whether I could procure one...lucked out and so glad I did! Truly enjoyable beer, worth the price...gonna cellar one bottle and spread the rest out to some friends. 1,423 characterselgiacomo, Dec 26, 2012

A: Slow-poured as not to disturb the sediment. Thin off-white head, fair amount of lacing when swirling that quickly dissipates. Body is dark mahogany.
S: Raisins, molasses...you could even smell it strongly while pouring, inviting. Nose is extremely sweet smelling, apples and pears dominate upon swirling.
M: Mouthfeel is medium to full. Not thin at all, but not chewy and thick like an imperial stout. This beer lies somewhere in the middle.
T: Raisins, apples, pears. Candied sugar came through as the beer warmed. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overbearing. I would not call this beer "hot." Rum-like qualities push through the fruit flavors. Pleasantly sweet but not cloying. Finish is dry.
Overall: First sip...thoughts are "One of the best beers I've ever had." Not sure if it's THE best, in fact I can probably name a few I've enjoyed more, but that's crossing styles. Drier and not as smooth as St. Bernardus. I'm drinking a Rochefort 10 right now for a comparison, there was a few hours between the two to avoid palate fatigue. Rochefort is harsher (not harsh though) but tastes just as complex.
I reviewed St. Bernardus a few years ago, but I unfortunately did not record the date. I would say this beer is just as good as St. Bernardus 12, but I haven't had one in about a year. I definitely prefer Westvleteren 12 over this particular Rochefort 10 I'm drinking as I type. However, the Rochefort is only 10 months old, and it sure tastes like some aging would do it justice. This Westvleteren is two years old, so perhaps it isn't a fair comparison. 1,654 charactersAlcahueteJ, Dec 25, 2012

M- Very bubbly with high carbonation and full bodied. Crisp bite on the tongue, and has a slight seltzer like feel to it.

4.3/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Black but not fully opaque, light ruby hue. Pours a one finger dense head. It is quite beautiful.
Aroma: Molasses, liquorice, medicinal characteristics and sweetness.
Taste: Dominated by rich and malty molasses. It's very sweet, with medicinal flavour and cough syrup stickiness. Warming alcohol all the way through. Like rich fruit cake.
Mouthfeel: Fairly heavy body, oily, rather light on the carbonation.
Overall: Well, I wouldn't miss the chance, even if it did cost me 19,5 EUR! This is from the new batch, released to make some extra profits for the monastery. I heard that there was a small batch at my local pub in Helsinki, Kuikka, and I had to try one before they run out. It's obviously a great beer, but I personally prefer Rochefort 10 -- this is just too sweet for me. It would go well with a rich chocolate dessert or fruit cake and it's fitting for Christmas time. Not worth the insane price tag though. I do feel that the praise for this beer is partly just due to the difficulty in obtaining it. 1,029 charactersArborescence, Dec 24, 2012

That was me last week at Top Hops in New York. When I heard this was coming out, I wanted to finally give it a go and see what all the fuss was about. Seeing that I'm not getting to Belgium anytime soon, I figured this would be my only chance to ever have a review this. It was really cold and and I waited a while but thankfully, it was worth the effort I put into getting my hands on this. Whether it's the best beer on the planet is another question, but it's one that I don't mind attempting to answer!
I thought the pour to this was amazing, with a nice raisin hue, ruby edges, and a head that would rival that of any root beer float. The aroma was the weakest aspect of this beer as it was quite strong with currant and raisin, but not as overpowering as I expected it to be. Thankfully, the lacing was present on my pint glass and the mouthfeel was about as full and balanced as any Belgian beer I've ever had. The alcohol up front gave way to an increasing amount of dark fruit, sugar, apple, and molasses with the booze sticking around in the aftertaste. The back reminded me of amaretto and finished just as clean as a cordial. It almost reminded me of mead because of how smooth and silky this was while having a strong fermented taste and strong alcoholic characteristic to this, while having a natural sweetness.
This was strong and very aggressive but never did the alcohol drown out all of the flavors and nuances that this had to offer. While I don't regret waiting for hours in the freezing cold to get my hands on a "brick" of this, it fell just a hair short of all the hype given to this. Most of that had to do with the unavailability of this beer in North America but there's no doubt that I don't regret a minute of the wait or cost of this beer. It's not #1 in my book but with so many offerings available these days, this easily beats out 99% of what's on the shelf or on tap at the local brewery or brewpub. This was fabulous from start to finish and I don't care what the extra bottles I have would fetch via a trade - they're either going into my stomach or to people that I deeply care about. Great beers like this do not deserve to be pimped out, but savored for the good times around good people. Anything less would be a disservice. 2,358 charactersJerzDevl2000, Dec 23, 2012

T - A bit of dark fruit up front which is quickly washed away by toasty brown malt. Lots of burnt sugar and toast in the middle with a spicy finish of clove, licorice, and some tea like herbal bitterness.
M - Medium body, moderately high carbonation, and a vey dry finish for such a strong beer.
D - Well, after years of wondering if I would ever have a chance to try this, here I am. You have to sort of expect that a beer with this much hype might fail, at least a little bit, to lie up to its reputation and as much as I hate to say it this is no exception. It is harshly toasty and kind of one dimensional, with a sickly sugary flavor that tastes like someone put too much sugar in their homebrew. It isn't as good as ABT 12 and its not even in the same building as Rochefort 10. I'm glad I only traded for one, I would guess this would fall off the top 100 rapidly if people could get it more easily. 1,175 charactersnickfl, Dec 21, 2012

S: dark fruits, molasses, spices, belgian yeast, candy and brown sugar
T: caramel and toasted malt base, brown sugar, fruits including pear, fig, some plum and raisin. Belgian yeast with some spices, mostly cinnamon and nutmeg. Hint of chocolate and toffee arrive in the finish.
M: crisp up front, finishing smooth and dry. medium to full body and moderate to high carbonation. oily, coating the palate
Overall: A lot of hype around this one. It is certainly an excellent beer. I feel there are other Quads out their that are similar enough to this one without all of the recognition. Regardless it was great to be able to try this one. 724 characterskylehay2004, Dec 21, 2012

San Diego, CA
A gorgeous beverage. Very dark ruby bordering on a complete brown, with a pillowing, light, airy, and creamy dark khaki colored head that leaves the glass with a constant sheet of sticky bubbles all the way down the glass. Gorgeous quad.
A collection of dark fruits in the aroma, chocolate cherries, figs, and dates, along with dark molasses, and distinct yeast character.
The flavor isn't quite as complex as the aroma, unfortunately, though still nice. Lots of dark fruit, spicy yet balanced yeast character, toasted biscuit, and just a bit of alcohol.
The beer is a triumph in the mouthfeel department. Silky, melting, creamy, and disappearing--wild for such a rich, and relatively sweet beer.
Fantastic, but truthfully not worth the price point with St. Bernardus and Rochefort examples readily available. Very glad I (finally) got to try this, however. 907 charactersehammond1, Dec 20, 2012

4.15/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Picked up two bricks on 121212 by taking a hostage teetotaler in with me to the store and have drank two of the bottles in the beautiful glasses provided in the set. An excellent Quad, still a little sweet but many complicated flavors and aromas come out as it warms up. I taste something like black cherry in it, but that is just my taste buds, I suppose - not many other people have picked that type of fruit note. 
Have had this BA account for some time without posting anything, although I look at it often and today I wanted to add a new beer from my local brewery that I am excited about, but found there is a 20 review limit before that can be done! So, the local beer is also a big Quad, and what I am about to say might be considered sacrilege to the obvious Westvleteren 12 lovers here but compared to the offering in the "brick" set, my local boys beat that!
Tomorrow we have a bocce game and there will be some vintage WV12's on hand to compare with these new ones so I will have my second review to post.
(BTW - anyone who says this brick set is overpriced does not value the glasses enough, they are excellent. And two - the bottle says in Latin, “Ad aedificandam abbatiam adiuvi” which means “I helped to build the abbey.” How cool is that?! 1,267 charactersRockAZ, Dec 19, 2012

A: A big, light brown head forms on top of the beer that is brown with red highlights. Medium to high level of carbonation.
S: Fruity (pear, apple, some banana), some sweet malt aroma, and almost a fruit syrup aspect? Perhaps candied fruit is a better comparison.
T: Big apple and pear notes. Sweet maltiness, some dark spiciness. A spicy sweetness that I can't quite place that reminds me of the spices in apple cider (cinnamon? cloves?) - but any comparisons to cider end there. Very noticeable alcohol at end - warming alcohol presence down the esophagus.
M: Medium body, great carbonation sensation present through a velvety beer - very nice. Alcohol very noticeable.
O: This is excellent, though hot...too hot right now. But, I can't wait to see what months and years do for this beer. 943 charactersmacrosmatic, Dec 19, 2012

And it’s all accented by my good fortune, as I was one of the 15,000 people to take place in the historic commercial crossing of the Atlantic by Westvleteren 12. I am grateful to have this opportunity – thank you, Shelton Brothers and St. Sixtus Abbey for all that you do!
A: Pours creamy as ever: as soon as the beer hits the glass it expands in a wave of silky beige foam. The body is a deep auburn color, thick and slightly hazy, only allowing a portion of light through its body. Head is sustained for a short time at about an inch or so before settling to a spotty layer of thin bubbles. At times, wet lacing clings to the side of the glass for a few seconds before falling back in.
S: A fruity, vinous nose rolls out tones of juicy red grape and raisin, sweet peach, and baked apple; all reminiscent of a strong cider or fruit wine. It’s an authentically pleasing aroma of natural fruit character, great on its own, but even better within the shell of grainy Belgian malt that’s just as evident in this nose. The grassy, tannic feel of these scents pulls you into a mill, wafting up as you watch the processing of wheat germ and smell the fresh product – incredible, and natural in every way. Nothing seems forced here, and that seems to show the true character of what this beer represents.
T: Incredible flavor – I can’t believe it, what everyone was saying was true. Dark fruit tastes swarm the palate with every sip, splitting through the initial alcohol warmth with tannic apple skin, sweet baked dates, lightly acidic citrus, and soft peach. A taste of fruit juice this isn’t: what we have here is a savory, chewy, sustained profile of fleshy fruit, turning almost pie-like when a few spots of spicy cinnamon and nutmeg appear. A warm cider alcohol taste extends along the underside of the fruity body; it’s one of those things where you can’t taste the booze as much as you can feel the fullness it imparts on the palate as a whole. Again, we’re talking fresh, natural fulfillment. Slight bitter hop to it, a rindy, herbal, flowery texture that reaches a short peak toward the end and settles almost as quickly as it emerges. Finishes with a mild flavor of vanilla bean and, while grainy wheat is present in the background throughout the drink, it’s showcased in the aftertaste to a fuller extent. 
M: Completely weightless in every way; the best texture of any beer I’ve ever tasted. It froths and flows around the tongue, but thickens and warms as it goes down, giving it an impossibly smooth-yet-powerful character. Any beer with this texture would be unforgettable, but with the palate described above, it’s legendary.
O: The thing I love most about beer is the way it can fulfill my palate and warm my soul with just a mix of simple ingredients. This beer showcases that majesty, the beauty inherent in simple ingredients accompanied by inspired craftsmanship, to a T. Drinking this was not only a splendid experience, but a part of beer history, and something that has inspired me to stay within the world of beer for as long as I possibly can.

S- lots of fruity sweetness. Dark cherry, plum, fig, and a fruit cakey breadyness. Still some alcohol presence, but it's almost masked by a honey like sweetness. What a funky nose this beer has. This just smells like a masterfully crafted quad.
T- wow! This is a hot little devil! More spicy than anything. Cloves, fruitcake, dried raisins. Not as much of the fruit as there is in the nose. Reminds me of a fine cognac or something.
M- thick and full bodied. The first sip the effervescence just went in and opened up my palate. Finish is dry.
O- overall, I feel that this bottle of westy 12 was damn enjoyable! Is it one of the best beers I've ever had? Well, I'll put it in my top 5 for sure. All hype aside this is a beautifully crafted beer and, in my opinion, on the same level as roch 10, and st bern 12. Give this beer 18 months and maybe it will rise to greatness.

Dark earthy, and murky nut brown pour; also a light gery tone that, along with some protein clumping (fuck) is worrisome. and a thick 3 finger head that shrinks to about 4cm and stabilizes. Very little lacing , i was expecting much more
Dark browned sweet cooked sugars dominate the nose. Subtle orchard fruits: pear, apple- maybe some cider spices. Toasted nuts and warm alcohol.
The mouth feel is smooth with a surprising lightness from the carbonation that gives a spicy tingle-bubbles at the end, dry on the front of the palate and juicy rear on the finish. Subtly present wood tannin without the overt acidity.
Very warming alcohol. Mulling spices: clove (including the numbness from the alcohol), cinnamon, mace, allspice, and white pepper. Roasted nuts in the middle, hazelnut sweetness, walnut creaminess. Caramel, licorice and hints of dried fruits. Lots of residual sugars especially on the finish. Juicy and oh so subtle.
As a taste experience, drop your pants and blow your load because this it fucking ineradicable. I have had a couple of beers that are about as complex but this was deceptively layered in a tight (not young but condensed) but not muddling fashion. Super complexity that takes only a slight effort to decode the majority and will give more as you look for it.
That being said I couldn't have this beer every day, or even more than special occasions, even if I could afford it. It is easy enough to drink and it hits all the right notes but the alcohol is about 1% too high for me and the finish is a little flat and is neither a complete taste (makes me want no more except to have it again) or left me wanting more .
Therefore I will give it two ratings and the above and a balance.

A - 4.25 : 4.0
S - 4.5 : 4.5

Appearance: dark brown, a bit cloudy with a thin head that dissipates to a clinging ring around the glass and some beautiful stubborn lace.
Smell: to be fair, I'm recovering from a cold...I smell apples. Not a complex smell. No indication the flavor to come...
Taste: Here is where it gets interesting. Here is where I say, "Oh. Okay. I get it." Yes, what people say about the complexity is true. I taste many things. Overall, one might compare it to a really fine, 20-year tawny port. Apples, raisins, prunes, strawberry, and spice but without the over-powering sweetness that you sometimes find in Belgian ales. It finishes with a nice, slightly tart crisp apple that balances it very well. Truly complex and well-balanced. A definite alcohol flavor that melds into the rest of the flavors so well that it just makes it seem like it was barrel aged for a very long time in fine sherry-cask scotch barrels. I don't know when I've tasted anything quite this good. I could drink it all day...what a shame it's so hard to come by!
Mouthfeel: much lighter in body than I expected - it's about a medium-light with a crisp, champagne-like carbonation.
Overall: Amazing flavor, as described, with a million other fabulous flavors that I'm too much of a novice taster to even detect I'm sure. I really like the way the lighter body balances out the richness of the flavor. What more can I say? 1,513 charactersHoly_Hop_Head, Dec 14, 2012

Extremely happy St. Sixtus sent a few bottles of their brew stateside, and I was lucky enough to pick up one of the bricks. (One good thing about South Carolina, no lines for rare beer releases.) Well, on to the beer.
This brew pours a clowdy tannish-brown with a single layer of lacey off-white head in my Westy glass that came with the beer pack. Some floaties on the second pour. Aroma is excellent, sweet plums, prunes, figs and caramel. Taste is sharp and spicy with many of the dark fruits I mentioned. The alcohol is hidden very well, although this is a heavier-than-most quad. A bit more bitterness than most quad on the follow-through. Noticeable hops.
Definitely can see the hype for this brew. A true classic, though probably not a ton of difference between this and Rochefort 10. Would I pay $85 for another sixer? No, probably not. But for this first chance to try it? Definitely. If I saw a single bottle on the shelves one day, I'd probably buy a bottle though. Well, time to sit down some of the other bottles and see how this beer changes. 1,080 characterssaintwarrick, Dec 14, 2012

3.32/5  rDev -28%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Here it is… the best beer in the world. Not only is this supposed to be the best beer in the world, it is also one of the hardest beers in the world to obtain. Outside of scheduling an appointment with the brewery in Belgium, this beer is nearly impossible to get. We lucked out and got ours on eBay. We grabbed two bottles for $50. Cheaper than a plane ticket, that’s for sure! I do want to see the brewery, regardless of how good the beer is.
We are writing this review on 12/12/12 for a reason. Today, in most cities and states, this beer was released for sale in limited edition (VERY limited edition) gift sets. The set came with six bottles and two glasses for $84.99. The bottles have commemorative labels on them, making it the first time they have ever put labels on this beer. You see, the monks that make this beer are not allowed to take a profit from it. But the brewery needs some TLC and to help raise money they decided to release the beer for the first and what may be the last time. We didn’t buy a gift pack, but a LOT of my beer drinking buddies online did.
Some folks say that this recipe is similar to the St. Bernardus Abt 12. That beer is easy to get, and I am actually not a huge fan of that one. It has a tolerable flavor toward room temperature, but has a weak aroma and basically no flavor. That, and the amount of hype behind Westvleteren… my expectations are REALLY high. I am excited to try it, and to write about it. I am even more excited that we were able to get a bottle without much trouble and without spending an arm and a leg. So today, as many wait in line to spend $84.99 on this beer… we toast you and your first experience with the best beer in the world. Bottoms up, people!
In the Glass: The beer is VERY carbonated. More so than I expected. It had a soda pop sort of head when pouring it into the glass. The head settled quickly leading to a deep dark brown, nearly black color in the glass. There is a very nice lace on this beer, as well. A thin head sits on top of the glass begging me to take a sip.
Nose: It smells like a quad. It is somewhat sweet, and has a subtle fruit aroma. I am getting almost fig on the nose. It is not ice cold, but is chilled. I wanted to make sure we gave it time to warm up as we reviewed it. I love the bottle, too. No labels… just says TRAPPIST on the neck. The bottles that were released today (in Arizona at Total Wine & More) came in a commemorative box and had labels on them. But this bottle, straight from the monks, doesn’t have a label. The cap says what it is… but that’s it! Oh, and I smelled the beer once again. Still sweet, and might be getting sweeter as it sits. OK… here we go. I am about to drink the “best” beer in the world.
Flavor: Yeah, that’s a quad. It has a nice mouthfeel (which I will get to) and slides across the tongue coating your palate with that same sweetness that I was getting on the nose. Maybe it’s just me, but this beer isn’t that impressive. I am not sure why people would rate this the “best” beer in the world. I like Belgian beers, but this is nothing special. If you would do a blind taste test next to the St. Bernardus Abt 12, I wouldn’t be able to tell a difference. It’s good, but this is not the best beer in the world. I have beers in my fridge that are better than this!
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is really nice. It is thick and does a great job of coating your tongue with flavors that lead to a nice aftertaste. On a second sip, I swirled it around in my mouth for a minute. It really opens up the flavors when doing that. It also heats the beer up just a tad, providing more sweetness than before.
Aftertaste: The aftertaste is nice. The sweetness hangs around and some malty flavors start to come forward… but they are here and gone again just as fast. If you have had a Belgian quad before, it is a very similar flavor. We had some quads in Belgium a few months ago… and they do taste better over there. But still. The aftertaste here is nice, and seeing as how I like sweets, that makes sense. 4,079 charactersrickyleepotts, Dec 13, 2012

A: Rich reddish brown coloring with an off white inch of a head that quickly dissipates into a few tiny bubbles. A bit of alcohol clinging to the glass. 
S: This beer smells pretty dank. So much fruity esters from the Belgian yeast strain coming through, that's raisins, plums and cherries. Malt sweetness too. Perfect for the style.
T: This is a balanced as can be. A sweet, fruity Belgian Quad but the attenuation on this is great, which provides a dry and slightly bitter tasting side to the beer. A complex, yet simple beer somehow. 
M: Perfect carbonation and medium-full body. Not too heavy or overpowering, the brew coats the mouth and goes down easy. There's a slight warming in the throat and stomach, great for the ABV. I'd love to get saucy off a couple of these.
O: I think people are disappointed or underwhelmed with hyped beers like this, and let's say a brew like Pliny the Elder, because they aren't in your face, extreme beers. They certainly are a bit over-hyped and played out to be, but at the end of the day, it comes down to how simple and balanced they are. This is just a perfectly balanced Trappist Quad that delivers. Sweet but not overly so, and just the right amount of dryness. It is complex as hell. This is a beer that's also amazing paired with food. I'd put the other Trappist Quads, like Rochefort and other Belgian versions of the brew style, St. Bernardus Abt. 12 for example, right up there with it but it does stand out. These monks are not fucking around over there and I do respect their choice not to expand and distribute this work of art widely. Thanks for the gift sets and good luck with modifications to your monastery. I really wish I had access to more though, guess I'll have to wait for my pilgrimage. I'm wit da hypebeasts on this one, go get it now! 1,852 charactersGoogs, Dec 13, 2012

A: This beer dishes out more head than Jenna Jameson. It sticks around for a while too and leaves some serious lacing around the glass. Color is dark amber.
S: Malty,Caramel, yeast, alcohol. 
T: Malty but really sweet at all. Lots of caramel, plum, yeast, and alcohol. Flavors are very complex. Has an amazing dry bitter finish that really balances all the malt that punches you up front. The alcohol is present but very subdued for 10.2 percent... it provides a bridge for the flavors to linger on the palate long after it goes down. 
M: Very full and rich yet not completely balanced. Really makes use of every taste bud. 
O: I've only found a few beers I like in this style. This is my new favorite. In the words of THE GREAT DALSA... BOOOSH! 865 charactersDNICE555, Dec 13, 2012

P: Poured a nice dark brown with a pretty good head.
S: Smell is unbelievable. Never opened a beer with such an intoxicating scent. Clearly a Belgian strong ale but much more complex.
T: Shockingly good. I'm. . .stunned.
M: Sublime. . .just keeps getting better the more I drink.
This beer is crazy good. I love trappist beers and have tried all of them. I regularly drink Rochfort and Beranardus and they don't come close. This beer is the only beer I've ever drank and immediately crowned it the best I've had. 656 charactersjerehall, Dec 13, 2012

A: Pours with a full frothy head that slowly settles down. Strong lacing. Color is deep amber. Well carbonated.
S: Malty, deep caramel, hay and alcohol
T: Taste is very malty, but not sweet. Lots of complex flavors. Caramel, plum, hay, yeast, alcohol. The taste is surprisingly dry. It has a long bitter aftertaste that dominates but is very pleasant. The taste is not overpowering but it dances on the tongue for a surprisingly long time.
M: Medium bodied, well carbonated. The mix of flavors seems to stimulate the entire mouth (Yeh, I know that sounds funny but that is the effect).
O: A great beer that defines the style. Best beer in the world? I think it is unfair to compare styles but there are other beers that I prefer. Best beer in this style? Maybe, but I have not tried them all yet (but I am working on it). Either way, this is a great beer that is worth seeking out. I hope to try it on tap someday. 1,015 charactersimscotty, Dec 12, 2012

Dark fruits and spice. Warming alcohol. Rum soaked fruit cake. Grassy spicy hops. Rich and bready.
Super rich and fruity gives way to bready and toasty. Cinnamon and clove. Quite sweet but not unbalanced. Warming alcohol in the back. Raisins and dates. Allspice as well. Haven't had many beers quite this rich. Just a hint of spicy noble hops.
Extremely full mouthfeel but with a good amount of carbonation. Thick and sweet but not cloying. Pretty amazing.
Perhaps I'm falling for the hype, but it does seem more rich, flavorful, and has a fuller mouthfeel than Rochefort and St. Bernardus. 690 characterssjccmd, Dec 12, 2012

A - Poured this into my Rochefort chalice. Dark brownish and clear no haze
S - suddle hints of apple and dark fruits
T - very complex, you get cherries and figs, deliciously sweet but not overpowering
M - incredibly smooth with clean finish and suddle alcohol burn, minimal carbonation 
O - a great beer worth trying. IMO it's a dulled down version of St Bernardus 12. The recipe for the St. Bernardus and Westy are the same, so if you can't get your hands on this one pick up a St. Bernardus and try that. I was lucky to bring one back from Belgium and it was very good. IMO the Westy is like the Bernardus little brother/cousin. 722 characterswhitehouse50, Dec 11, 2012

A: a few seconds after popping the cap beer is overflowing from the bottle. I quickly pour into the snifter and it pours an opaque dark amber color with ample, pillowy beige head, easily two fingers high.
S: Mustiness with rich dark malty aroma. I sense a bit of sourness in there too.
T: Rich bready maltiness with typical belgian spiciness. Also getting some vanilla that has kind of melded itself to the alcohol. Its almost as if this was barrel aged.
M: Heavy carbonation with a modestly dry finish.
O: I am not a good judge of belgians as I have not had many but I enjoyed this. The belgian spiciness which tends to be off-putting to me is balanced quite nicely with rich maltiness and alcohol warmth. 820 charactersBeerdregs, Dec 07, 2012

High carbonation on initial pour. Brown with some light and apparent clarity. A beige head that lingers nicely. Aroma is raisins, figs, dates and brown sugar. Not strong but firm. Taste follows closely with an incredible depth of flavor. There's a lot to explore. With so much going on, it's still incredibly balanced and coordinated. There's very little sign of the 10+% alcohol other than a gentle warming feeling. The feel is very light and airy. It almost evaporates as it hits your mouth.
I really enjoyed this one. I look forward to seeing what some age can do for it. 662 charactersGJ40, Dec 05, 2012

4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5330ml bottle poured into a small Westvleteren IIX chalice.
A - A slow foam pushes upward as the cap pops off, leading to a pour of surprisingly effervescent beer. Active carbonation bubbles away as a lighter-than-expected brew fills my glass. It's a sort of dark brownish color, with red/orange/purple highlights when held up to the light. Despite the somewhat fizzy nature of the head during the pour, it appears a dense layer of light tan foam has formed, and isn't going anywhere. Bits of sediment can be seen floating in the murk at the bottom of the glass. Bits of lace form, although nothing substantial. So far so good.
S - The aroma is complex to say the least. The booze is certainly immediately identifiable, along with a wide variety of other notes. Cherries, plums, raisins, figs and dates. Sweet candi sugar, with mild spices and bready Belgian yeast. Molasses and brown sugar poke through as well. Pungent, but subtle. balanced and mild, but bold. Only thing throwing me off is the phenolic bite.
T - Sometimes I find that Belgian beers are simply representations of their respective styles, and don't push the flavor profiles into big, bold incarnations of those styles; they bring to the table would you'd expect, but nothing more. Westvleteren IIX doesn't do this. This brew is big, bold, complex, and delicious. Fruits are right up front, with dates, figs, cherries, and plums all coming through, complimented beautifully by sweet candi sugar and other sweet notes. Well developed base of bready malt, Belgian yeast, which is superb here, and other earthy notes. The sweeter side is balanced nicely by lots of spice, with ginger, cinnamon being at the forefront. The spice lingers long into the finish. Molasses, brown sugar and and other sweet flavors come through as well. Earthy hops and a gentle boozy warmth give it some edge. A magnificent meld of bready yeast, spices, dark dried fruits, and sweet malt. World-class.
M - The mouth on this one is flawless. Fine bubbly carbonation and a nice medium body make this one smooth as silk. Still, it fills the mouth nicely, with a perfect consistency, giving way to a finish in a class of it's own. Slight stickiness, and there's no denying the alcohol presence on this one, but it all goes together with the profile perfectly. 
D - An all around superb beer, and it's easy to see why it's regarded as one of the top brews in the world. While I've always been attracted to the Belgian beers out there, Quads/BSDAs usually fall a bit short for me, but this one was certainly different. That being said, the massive price-tag and exclusivity make it a little harder to enjoy. I've yet to try Rochefort 10, but I can't imagine this is THAT much better than it. Either way, I'm glad I got the chance to try this one; world-class and a benchmark for the style. 2,828 charactersConverge, Dec 01, 2012

Poured into the little Westy XII chalice... long lasting tannish head atop a fairly clear walnut brew... great lacing and retention.
Nose is rich and malty.... complex mix of dark toast... caramel... light peppery notes... raisin... maybe some dark plum... A little cold with the initial pour... but warmth really blooms the aromas and helps them meld into near perfect territory.
Flavor is wonderful.... again very very complex... brown maltiness makes me think a bit of a nutty addition.. tons of malt character without ever being sweet.. nice balance of esters and spicy phenols pull and push all the nuances into a great bow that allows the flavors to linger forever on the palate.
I always think the 12 is a bit overcarbonated.... but what do I know? the carbonation is little bubble and lends a fairly creamy quality to the medium bodied brew.
Not much else to say other than this is IMHO the benchmark for the quad style... I had a St. Bernardus 12 recently and still think the Westvleteren is better by a decent margin.
Funny that I've never reviewed this ... Inflatablechair has opened the 12 in my presence at least a few times that I can remember... While I thank Sam, this bottle (and the 5 others) all my appreciation goes out to LaLaLoveYou... Lauren is a rockin' trader.

S: Raisins at first, maybe a little banana. As it warms a dark, honey-like smell is wafting in and out. Sort of molasses, but, not quite. Figs show up as it warms even more. When will it stop evolving? Can't quite put my finger on this nose, but, it is rather heavenly. Complex is a word that comes to mind, but, it's more than that, sort of all-encompassing. Now, even later, licorice comes through as it loses carbonation. 
T: Heat is apparent, but, in a good way. Figs, raisins, molasses and a wonderful yeast. Can't wait to crack another, when the snow flies, and go outside for a walk. 
M: Superb mouthfeel, carbonation is spot-on, the way beers should strive to be.
O: This, to me, is the ultimate Christmas beer, it has a certain holiness to it, and I am not a church-goer! Glad to finally try this brew, even more glad I have 5 more!

Appearance - Pours a murky reddish brown with a surprising off white head. Chunky and sedimenty. Collar of foam.
Smell - Sherry and other oxidized flavors. Very fruity. The caramel malt still comes through.
Taste - Significantly better than the aroma. The oxidation makes it a little creamier. Lots of sherry. No booze. Buckets of dark fruit. A touch sweet with a somewhat rough cardboard finish.
Mouthfeel - No booze. Low carbonation. Way too oxidized, but it's still pleasant to drink.
Overall - I should really review a fresher bottle. This is really oxidized but the quality of the beer still comes through. Westy with sherry. 763 charactersAlieniloquium, Oct 20, 2012

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5One of the few beers that deserves an all 5-pt rating, this beer is mind blowing.
Bottled date was 4/13/12, poured into 15cl Westvleteren XII glass.
Great deep dark brown color with a small light tan head, the aroma is sweet like candy with hints of plum and a very slight sniff of alcohol but not immediately present. The taste is incredibly complex, so much going on with the belgian candy sugar, molasses, the roasted notes from the malts and the dark fruit just all meshes so beautifully together with what is an amazing yeast strain. To get to 10% with almost no presence of alcohol lingering is quite amazing while keeping enough residual sugar that it lingers on your lips, it's by far the best quad / belgian strong dark ale I've ever had. The body is rich, smooth and complex with medium carbonation to enhance the sweetness and finish, just great overall beer. I wish all beer was this wonderfully crafted. 918 charactersProspero, Oct 17, 2012

T-comes in with a great and bold taste of belgian grains and dark fruits. actually has quite a touch of booze and even some bitterness to it. wow its a strong taste that will leave a long lasting impression. its actually a pretty hot beer, much like most belgian quads i've had. 
M-medium creamy carbonation with a decent bitter finish
O-this is definitely a world class beer. however, its not my favorite quad. its fairly harsh. it has a taste that kicks back with a heat. i was hoping the flavors to be a bit more mellow. i don't regret spending a lot for it. i recommend anyone to do the same, if just for the reason to kill you curiosities. 816 charactersAdamBear, Oct 16, 2012

Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation. Really foams up in the mouth across the palate. Nice 
Overall: Very good but a little less substantial than expected. Compared to the Rochefort 10 its a little underpowered and much sweeter. Very good beer but not earth changing. Much more enjoyable over the long run than the rochefort 10; more welcoming and pleasant. 813 characterscradke, Oct 10, 2012

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The heavens opened up, and His light came down and landed on a small Abbey of Monks. In turn, they grace the world with one of the perfectly complex beers for those lucky enough to find and partake.
I have been lucky enough to spend a year visiting my wife and kids in France, just 45 minutes away from the abbey. In my visits, I would have a beer in the restaurant, and take home a few boxes for enjoyment. The 12 sets the standard; a Holy Grail for those lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. I had a "taste" of one in Pittsburgh at the House of 1000 Beers (New Kensington), where four of us split one bottle ($9 each, for 3 ounces!). I first visited the Abbey with wife and kids, sitting on the outdoor veranda and enjoying each second of the visit. I've been finding that the best beers are made better by the journey and the exclusivity of the brew. In this case, the journey was as memorable as the beer, and the beer is 'top rate.'
Appearance (5.0). Smooth and deep, thick but light, dark reddish brown, with sticky lacing after a full head. Thinking that I heard the voice of god as I took my first sip of beer, I was disappointed to look up and see my waiter asking for my lunch order. I had ham sandwich and salad. 
Smell (5.0). Too many real smells, blending together to show hints of plum and fig, yeast and a bit of sunshine. The garden also helped enhance the smells, as the spring morning gave way to a pleasant afternoon.
Taste (5.0). Who can argue on the complex nature of the tastes, which changed and grew as the beer became warmer. By the end of the 2nd draft, I had hints of chocolate and fig, brown sugar and caramel. 
Mouthfeel (5.0). A party. Bubbles and Belgian at first, and then calm and tasty to finish. 
Overall (5.0). After the skies shined, we had to return home. But not without stopping at the gift shop to pick up as many boxes of the samplers as I could manage. Flew home with four boxes of beer (four glasses, four 12, four 8 and 8 blond). Gave one box to my brother, split one with my beer nerds, and saved two for myself. I can't wait to try the 8 & 12 in a few .... years. 2,136 characterssbrotschul, Sep 30, 2012

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tasting this beer, drinking this beer is very different than what you might expect.
The Westy 12's distinguishing feature is its complexity. It is a multi-layered experience. None of the vertices that lay down its shape are arbitrary, though. Other reviews guess at the 'notes' which range from being raisins to prune to plums to dates to molasses. Whatever the true sources are, the beer is almost classical in that a) there aren't too many of them; b) they exist in just the right combination.
Unlike an Oerbier, say, which is similarly well-crafted -- the Westy 12 is actually thirst-quenching. It's even a bit watery, without that detracting from the flavor or composition at all.
On the way down, it diffuses beautifully. It's the kind of beer that gives you a red, full face with which you can go out and face a winter's night.
This beer is not a gut-buster. In my experience it is unique. You can wrestle with it for long hours, drinking one after another. But instead of besting you or defeating you -- and instead of wasting your time -- the beer seems to match you move for move. It dances with you. It never overpowers you. Until by gentleman's agreement, the match is over, and you get up and find pleasantly that you can hardly walk.
N.B. This beer was had by the reviewer on two separate summer afternoons at the In de Vrede cafe attached to the monastery in 2012. He had 2-4 of them on each occasion. 1,420 charactersamendt, Sep 27, 2012

Dated 07.01.14, so about a year and nine months old. In my limited experience, about 2 years on these is best. 
A - The beer pours just right. Nice two finger head that sticks around for a while. Head is light tan, with maybe some slight red in it. The body is a gorgeous deep amber. Very dark, but red and brown in it. 
S - It's that distinctive, complex quad aroma. A lot of sweetness in this. Black cherry, chocolate, cinnamon, plum, molasses, and brown sugar. Very much in your face with strong aromas.
T - Pretty similar to the aroma on this, very complex. Dark fruits such as cherry, grape, and prune. Also some chocolate and sugar. A great balance between that fruit and sweetness.
M - Strong all around. Nice body and carbonation. Does hit the back of the mouth with a little pucker, but still nice. 
O - Really a nice beer. Goes down smooth, yet is complex and has a lot going on. No evidence of alcohol despite the 10.6% in there. It is very dark, so you need to be in the mood for something like that, but if you are, this is definitely one of the best. 1,184 charactersRuckusDu, Sep 27, 2012

A - Pours a dark muddy brown beneath a permanent creamy head and expansive sheets of lacing. Good start.
S - Woah....cant talk...ohh... hold on...F*ck this smells incredible. Thick wafts of creamy chocolate and marshmellow, hazelnut, freshly baked brown bread, musk, yeast, rye, slightly medicinal. Just bloody orgasmic. 
T - Much of the same on the tongue, with the addition of dark fruits, particularly prune. Sweet rosewater, nutty turkish delight, rocky road, deep bready grains. An unmitigated joy.
M - Smoooth. Mellow with a soft warmth like a dying fire. FULL body. Complex to the extreme and indescribably delicious.
O - I had this in the pantry for about a year, waiting for that special occasion to crack this one open. One rainy, windy Friday evening at home with the wife I decided that given the hype of this beer, it must be a special occasion in itself to drink a Westy 12, and I can tell you now that I was not wrong. Incredible depth of flavour, sumptuous heavenly aroma, reaches the dizziest heights of beer quality. Exceeds the hype. Best beer I have ever had. 1,162 charactersdansmcd, Sep 25, 2012

A: murky brown with some amber highlights. little specs of sediment are seen floating around. thin brown head fizzed out to nothing in no time flat.

T: sweet dark fruits and alochol is about it.
M: Starts thin but finishes thick as syrup. Warming effects from the alochol. Seems kinda flat, could use more carbonation.

Pours a murky medium-brown amber, yellowish at the edges. One finger of cream-colored head. Decent retention and lacing.
Smell is a combination of thin high-nose volatile compounds, and deep fruits like plums and dates. Nice varied fruity aromas. Sugar is fairly low, and it's not as sweet or as complex as I would hope.
Taste is fine, but most of the flavors are shallow fruity flavors, not really wowing me. Has some deeper flavors, but they're tough to dig out. Main complaint is that it's lacking the layering and depth that the best big big beers have. Alcohol is strong in the flavor, as an astringent bitterness that comes in late. Good, but not my favorite.
Mouthfeel is slick and full, with medium-low carbonation. Just fine.
What can I say? I know tons of people love this beer. I hope to try it again, to see if my opinion remains the same. But for now, I find it to be in the upper tier of quads, but definitely not at the top. I prefer some others over it by a decent margin. 1,138 characterszeledonia, Sep 18, 2012

A - Poured a dark, brown. First a bit translucent, but cloudy later on with the swirled yeast.
S - Nose is ripe, fruity. Dark sugary aroma. 
T - Huge flavours. Dark fruit, raisins, prunes, concord grapes. Spicy, winey, and thick molasses. Big alcohol and moderate backing bitterness. Very sweet, smooth but also very heavy and strong.
M - Heavy, sweet and not quite syrupy but with smoothness to it.
D - Definite sipper, and TBH something I would prefer to split 2 ways. Still, amazing complexity and flavour. 707 charactersallergictomacros, Sep 18, 2012

4.59/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally decided to crack open my sole bottle of this much heralded beer. Roughly two years in the cellar, after drinking it I could easily see how this would be a prime candidate for extended aging. Perhaps when it becomes available stateside I will spring for a box and stash it away. 
Pours a deep mahogany with faint reddish highlights; a small cream colored head settles fairly quickly but becomes a foamy cappuccino topping as it rests and remains there for the duration of the beer. Patchy lacing slips around the sides of the glass. The aroma is complex as is the taste. In fact this is one of the most complex beers I’ve tried, with tons of nuanced layers emerging over time and as the beer warms. Rum-soaked raisins and fruitcake, apples, almonds and marzipan, toffee and caramel, plums, figs, dates, and prunes all make an appearance. Each sip reveals another facet. Has to be served at cellar temperature to glean all of these fine details. A restrained bitterness emerges in the aftertaste, and the finish is fairly dry, with fading memories of dark fruit, pleasantly warming alcohol, and marzipan.
Medium-bodied and carbonated, clean and crisp, but velvety smooth and creamy. Yes, it’s probably a bit overrated due to its scarcity, but it’s certainly the best quad I’ve tried. Others come close, and it doesn’t destroy Rochefort 10 or even the best of De Dolle, but it is better than them, deeper and more complex but a good measure. Worthy of its place atop the pantheon of Trappist beers to be sure. 1,526 characterstobelerone, Sep 17, 2012

A: Dark amber, brown with a creamy half-finger head. Glass w/o yeast shows some light when held up, but the glass w/ swirled yeast is much darker.
S: Rich dark fruits. Deep toffee. Fairly sweet, lightly floral. Namely fig, dark plum, and candied fruit in the nose.
T: Sweet fig. The ultimate malt-forward beer, with candied fruit, moderately spicy bread. The glass with the swirled yeast is stronger in flavor, but introduces phenolic notes which I do not enjoy. So, pour carefully.
M: Thin to moderate in body with moderate to high carbonation. Works well.
O: Very good. Obviously hyped, but more enjoyable than any other Trappist beer that I've tried. At three years, it's tasting very nicely. 750 charactersHophead717, Sep 17, 2012

Pours a hazy raisiny-brown color with sediment and a large fluffy tan head with excellent retention and lace. 
Smells of rich dried fruits such as dates, raisin and figs. A touch boozy. Caramel and Belgian candy. Even a touch of spice like mild cinnamon. 
Flavor explosion following the characteristics noted in the nose. Dark dried fruits especially. Again a touch of heat which I love and fits this beer. I wanna know this will fuck me up when I drink it. 
Mouth is bright and effervescent with high carbonation. Ligh bodied yet slightly sticky. 
Overall just a world class phenomenal beer. It's been a long time since I was able to enjoy one of these guys. I love it young and look forward to trying my other one with a few years on it in the near future. 808 charactersMrVonzipper, Aug 28, 2012

Poured all of it without swirling the yeast, so I poured a bit of it but not all.
So this is a dark brown, hazy beer. Not that much light coming through, quite some visual carbonation when poured in the Westvleteren chalice and a small off white head with good retention.
Smells rather complex, lots of dark fruits, sweet melon oddly enough, molasses and also rather vinious. Dark caramel malts in this too. 
This is a sweet fruity beer, dark fruits, some melon sweetness but also a beer a rather firm malty backbone to it. Slightly alcoholic but it only adds to this beer. Very good stuff.
Medium to full bodied, quite alot of carbonation. Creamy and smooth. Highly drinkable.
Overall a very good beer, I love Belgian Darks so this one is right up my alley. Recommended although I do not believe it is really worth the kind of money some people dare to ask for it. I bought a couple of sampling kits from the abbey and they were €9 for 3 bottles, one of each of their beers.
Best beer? Probably not but for the rather small style of quadrupels this one is probably the most complex and probably the best, atleast compared to the ones I had. 1,194 charactersIPA35, Aug 25, 2012

Very dark, purplish brown body, small amount of white head. Not much lacing.

Fruity and malty all the way, reminescent of grape juice than another specific fruit. mellow flavor overall, with low-to mid lingering of flavor.

A: Pours a cloudy, dark amber color. Almost brown in color. A frothy white head forms on the pour and leaves nice, sticky sheets of lace.
S: Big yeasty notes up front, some fruity esters and minimal dark fruit. Bready malts are also heavy on the nose.
T: Dark fruits, figs and dates, are up front neck and neck with the big sweet yeast notes. Bready malts with some light caramelization. Pale malts and some fruity esters.
M: Slightly prickly carbonation with a nice and smooth medium body. There is some slight chew to it as well. Sweet and doughy on the finish.
O: While this was good I'd rather spring for a Rochefort 10 anyday. It didn't have enough burnt sugar and caramelization for me. 831 charactersTreebs, Aug 20, 2012

A - Opaque cream brown with ruby tints with a 1.5 finger fluffy head with excellent head retention and excellent clumpy, sticky lacing around the whole glass.
S - Candied dates, raisins, molasses, alcohol, funky bready yeast, lemon, bread pudding, fruit cake.
T - Very sweet dark fruit initially like sipping the essence of Christmas, dates, plums, candied raisins, molasses, honey notes are follows by warming alcohol which dances with the bready, biscuity yeast flavors and finishes with a nice comforting smooth creamy dark fruit finish.
M - Medium body, moderate-low carbonation, sticky with a lot of warming alcohol.
O - An excellent beer, I close my eyes and think of sitting next to a warm fire in winter.

S: Caramel, malt, dark fruits, brown sugar
T: To be honest with you, I don't think I will be able to distinguish this from Rochefort 12 or Pannepot. All three are excellent Quads. Maybe Westy was sweeter than the two... but really that's about it (from my memory anyway). I would love to do a side-by-side to see if I can tell them apart. With that said, this is a world-class beer. Dark fruits, huge caramel, some booziness, some chocolate note, very sweet but it covers the alcohol fairly well. 
M: Extreme smoothness. This is where this beer really shines, imo. Slightly hot from the alcohol burn. 
O: I am glad I finally get to try this. I wouldn't seek out for it anymore though - I think Rochefort 12 is just as good as this and available at local beer shops.
EDIT: I just wanted to add that the bottle I was dated 10.2.15 - I think this means it was bottled on Feb 15, 2010 (and I am reviewing this on Aug 12, 2012 - so about 2.5 years). Even with two years, I think this could benefit from further aging.
2nd Edit: I was just informed by another BA that the bottle I had was from Feb 2012 (not Feb 2010). 1,210 characterssukwonee, Aug 13, 2012

S: Rummy. Phenolic. Bit of pipe tobacco. Underwhelming.
T: Queer flavour in the background - can't put my finger on it. Alcoholic bitterness. Sweet rummy aftertaste with some fresh cut grass - reminds me of Duvel. Slightly phenolic. Essentially it's a balance of sweetness and dark caramel. Pleasant alcohol burn down the throat, never had that from a beer before. There's a very subtle almond flavour at the bottom end of the spectrum and dark molasses at the top. A bit pipe tobacco-ey but not half as much as I was hoping for. Burping up Coca Cola.
M: Perfect. Smooth.
O: Having watched lots of hyperbolical Youtube reviews I was hoping for something about ten times more special, but absolutely no revelations here. I find mass produced Duvel more flavourful than Westy 12. A very nice drink but don't fall for the hype I say. 897 charactersHoppsbabo, Aug 09, 2012

Poured from bottle into Westvleteren Chalice. Poured a deep chestnut brown with slight deep red hue on edges. Slight bit of off-white head.
Smell is fantastic. Great dried fruit, chocolate, fig, booze, and roasted malt aromas. Taste was truly amazing. All the aromatic elements showed up here...but it was the balance of a slight chocolate and dried fruit flavors and the high boozyness that really made this just so tastey. Amazingly smooth, but noticeably strong. Its as if this wasnt even beer, but an entirely different beverage all together. 
Price paid - roughly $40 USD, but more than worth the price for this beer; which is rightfully one of the best beers in the world. 749 charactersDrinkSlurm, Aug 07, 2012

4.74/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours a bubbly, cloudy, dark brown with champagne bubbles that linger but don't really maintain a solid head.
Smell: Spot on. All the dark, Abt/Quad elements one wants. Figs, dark, burnt sugar, clove and banana from the Trappist yeast.
Taste: Very powerful flavours. The mellow softness differentiates this from the Rochefort. The flavours here are calming maltiness, herbal spiciness, floral hoppiness and a lot of breadiness in the backbone.
Mouthfeel: To me, just a slight too much carbonation, but the smoothness and creaminess of the beer, minus the prickly bubbles is quite delectable.
Overall: I'm glad I got to try this in a way that supports the monks. This fundraiser gift-pack showed up in Alberta and I just had to pick it up even though it had a price tag of $75 for 6 of the Westy 12's and 2 collectible glasses. Not a terrible deal I suppose compared to the grey market prices, but still more than I'm used to paying. The beer speaks for itself though and there's a reason it's generally considered to be the greatest Trappist ale out there. 1,072 charactersHornet2003, Aug 05, 2012

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I made the pilgrimage to St. Sixtus to drink this beer. It was a highlight of my Belgian beer tour. I started with one bottle of each of Westvleteren's beers and the 12 was hands down my favorite.
It poured so smooth. The lace on glass was a perfect amount. The flavors were all delicate and came together to so perfectly for a smooth flavorful drinking experience. I tend to not like dark beers because they can feel too heavy. Despite the dark color this beer is not heavy at all. 
I even managed to score a few bottles to bring home to America. I poured one a month later wondering if it would be as amazing as at the Abbey. It was. Once again it poured perfect and tasted amazing. 686 characterslaurastradford, Aug 03, 2012
4.54/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5****500th BA review****
11.2oz bottle. Cap date reads 7.10.12, so I assume this has some nice age on it. I've had it in the cellar for nearly two years. Poured this into an unmarked snifter to split with a couple of other people.
A: Pours out a murky deep reddish brown color. I actually got some off white head initially, but then it settled into just loose bubbles around the edges of the glass. Some sticky lacing bits are left with a slight swirl around.
S: On the nose, I get the typical dark fruit aromas: raisin, figs, dates, prune, maybe some plum. Pulling some candied sugar notes. Malt sweetness leads to some caramel and toffee like smells. It really does smell amazing.
T: For the taste, strangely I get that candied sugar right away. Then the dark fruit component comes in. For sure, rum soaked raisin, fig, date, you name it. Those sweet malts give off delicious toffee flavors. It's so smooth. Nicely carbonated actually, which was a surprise. No booze but some heat warms the throat. Really a truly impressive brew.
M: Full but thinner than expected because of the carbonation.

I had this with my best beer bud, Cervezango, while sitting in Brussels. This beer was a somewhat dark brown with a little ruby. The head was nice and creamy, a little off white. The smell sweet, herbal, toasty, caramel, alcohol, malty for sure. The taste as complex as the smell. The high alcohol isn't as strong as it would seem. This beer has it all. Creamy feel. I could review this again every day and probably not get board. I paid about $15 for one bottle, and I don't even regret it. 578 characterscambabeer, Jul 31, 2012
4.9/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance: - Pours rather hazy brown. Somewhat lighter than I'd expect. Head retention on this one was pretty lacking. One finger head faded withing a minute or two. Yeast suspended and settled somewhat on the bottom.
Smell: - Dried figs. Somewhat malty. Some alcohol definitely present
Taste: - Sweet- dried fig overwhelmingly apparent. Some serious alcohol aftertaste, but less than what I would expect for the ABV. Malty and delicious. 
Mouth Feel: - at first, almost too carbonated. Champagne-like effervescence detracts somewhat from the taste for this style in my opinion. I Let it sit and warm up for a few minutes (probably started a little too cool), and the mouth feel smoothed out remarkably.
Overall: Definitely a great beer. Somewhat sweeter than I'd expect, but I really like that. For my next one I'll try a more vigorous pour and make sure its starting at a better temp. 891 charactersPsychmusic, Jul 30, 2012

A slight haze in a caramel brown body, thumbs width of beige foam hangs around for quite a while ending up as a thin film that leaves just a few random patches of lace 
S brown sugar or perhaps its brewers candy, has some dark fruits and dried fruits alike, rum raisin with a little yeast and booze, I get some spice but can't quite place it and a little candied cherry
T more spice and booze then I could smell, not as much complexity as the nose but still quite nice, a little wet wood I didn't smell
M its a little foamy and has a faint booze burn, nice lingering aftertaste of spice, hazelnut and raisin
O I almost really liked the taste so I'm bumping the overall. Pretty solid beer but it needs a few years too mellow out
I hate too say it but I'm a little disappointed even though I really enjoyed it. I couldn't taste the hype or rarity perhaps because I didn't need too go further then the liquor store I work too buy it. I preferred an aged bottle of the "8" for sure and will perhaps re-rate this one after it has some age on it. 
Great beer but nowhere near the best the world has too offer, I've only had this one fresh but I have a feeling it won't stand up too a Rochefort 10 of the same age 1,283 characterswordemupg, Jul 26, 2012

4.45/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Reviewing the Westvleteren 12. I have had the Westy 12 fresh (1 year old) and aged 6 years. 
On this particular night, I opened up Westvleteren 12 from 2007 alongside a Rochefort 10 2006 with my good friend Greg (BeerListMan) in Chicago. 
Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort 10 aged are both super complex, but the Westvleteren 12 won due to it's smooth drinkability. There was absolutely no trace of alcohol and everything was so well balanced in the drink. Rochefort 10 still had some 'power' in it and it was extremely tasty and drinkable but the flavors were a little bit more unbalanced. The date, raisin, plum flavors in the Westvleteren 12 were more pronounced while I tasted more bready characteristics (almost like drinking rye) in the Rochefort. 
The only difference is that I enjoyed the heavier, syrupy mouthfeel of the Rochefort 10 over the slightly lighter bodied Westvleteren 12. 
A good way to describe this would be to drink a Highland Park 18 year scotch alongside a similar type of scotch with 15 years.. The 18 year will rock your world due to its drinkability and smoothness and the Westvleteren 12 did the same thing against the Rochefort 10. That being said, I would still age my Rochefort 10s because of its availability in the US. 1,253 charactersChicagoJohn, Jul 25, 2012

Will be sharing this rare score with my BA in crime Andrenaline who is at the mercy of the pitiful LCBO beer selection in Ontario.
A - poured into the small gold rimmed chalice that came with the gift pack, hazy ruby brown, creamy tan head that didn't go anywhere and left perfect lacing all around
S - toffee, sour boozy raisins, grains, herb/mineral, all mellow and balanced aromas
T - starts with a blend of toffee and candied plumb & cherry, moves to a bread pudding flavour with mild wintery spices, finishing with a faint boozy sweetness and and gentle herbs
M - not sure if I've every given a 5 for mouthfeel but this is it, light and fluffy, the creamiest smoothest brew i've had the privilege of drinking, light pleasant boozy warmth with no bite to be found, it melts in your mouth
O - I must admit given the price paid I was instantly skeptical and expecting a lot, and this delivers the goods, its not a big in your face brew and therein lies the genius, it is so mellow and well inviting that you would never guess this is a big ass Belgian.

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5OK, I've been sitting on this one for a couple of years now, and I figured that the beer isn't doing me any good collecting dust. Enjoying this beer for my 800th review here on BA. Review is from notes taken on 7/15/2012. Poured from the bottle to a snifter.
Appearance: Pours as a Quad should -- rich and dark, caramel brown with some deep ruby hues where the light comes through; starts with a big, full 2 finger off-white/light tan head that sticks around for a moment or two and fades to a full and frothy cap; body is dark, but it's moderately clear and free of sediment; 
Smell: Full of rich, dark and very ripe fruit -- smells of figs, dates, raisins; some nice and sweet caramel malts in the back; definite alcoholic and vaporous whiff to it, but it's well blended and not burning the nostrils at all. 
Taste: Meh, I've had better. Just kidding. I can see this beer is as hyped as it is, and it earns every bit of it. Part of me thinks that it could be a matter of the rarity or the rave reviews it has received over the years that are tainting my thoughts, but it's absolutely fantastic. Very sweet and full of the dark and ripe fruits as mentioned in the nose; it has a touch of some Belgian spiciness to it, and a nice bready and yeasty flavor; alcohol is present, well blended, but making a strong appearance nonetheless; some sweet caramel malt falls on the tongue after the booze burns off. 
Mouthfeel: This beer just seems to keep getting better as I go... The body is full, chewy, but not heavy -- very sticky on the palate; the carbonation is full and lush, leaves the gums very tingly; the alcoholic vapor adds to the tingle on the gums, and it warms the belly.
Overall: Worth the wait and the Dark Lord that I traded to get it. Stands out from other Quads in quality and mouthfeel, well balanced and amazing. I would drink this beer everyday if I could, and that's not easy for me to say about Quads because I sometimes find that they weigh me down. I would be willing to sacrifice my body to the beer-bellied gods to have this frequently. 2,063 charactersbamadog, Jul 16, 2012

Score: 93
Unknown vintage bottle (the dates were rubbed off on the cap). Served in a snifter glass and enjoyed on 06/23/12 at the inaugural Chicago craft beer lovers meeting. Huge thanks to Robbie Moy for sharing this one with me. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Pours a murky caramel color with a thin layer of tan bubbly head. 4/5
Smell: Sweet and fruity. Sugary caramel, berries, blueberries, plum, brandy, raisins, and bready clove too. 4.5/5
Taste: Exactly like it smells, with a lingering fruitiness. 4.25/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied, low carbonation. Juice-like mouthfeel. Fruity, dry finish. 4/5
Overall: All-in-all, I enjoyed this one. However, I did not think that it lived up to its lofty hype as one of the world's best beers. I am told that this one is best aged, but I also had a 2009 bottle at Dark Lord Day this year that I was not overly impressed with either (although in all fairness, that other bottle had been sitting open on a table for several hours before I got a chance to try it). I personally liked Westy 8 better, but I will have to try to age the bottle I have for several years to see if my opinion of this brew changes with time.
Recommendation: While an excellent beer, it's not quite worth it's trade weight. Nonetheless, it is a delicious beer that is worth drinking if you get the chance to sample this beer.
Pairings: Banana bread.
Cost: $85 for a "brick" that comes with six 12 oz bottles and two Westy 12 glasses. 1,622 charactersjegross2, Jul 14, 2012

A- Dark brown, a bit cloudy but too dark to be completely translucent anyway, big light-colored head as always.
S- Raisin, plum, fig, has that classic grape aroma that I always get from traditional quads, slightly sweet, some malt, a little bit of alcohol burn on the nose.
T- Tons of raisins, although most of the other fruit flavors I mentioned come through as well. It's so bitter at first but it finishes off sweet, very well balanced between the two. As it got warmer it got more bitter, which is a characteristic I don't recall from prior tastings, I remember it being much more sweet. Also not as smooth as I remember, much more alcohol presence.
M- A whole lot of bubbles on your tongue to help it go down, nice amount of carbonation and a great mouthfeel.
O- Awesome beer, without a doubt one of the best quads in the world, but this is the freshest I've ever had the pleasure of drinking (about 5 months old) and I have to say, older vintages tasted much better. I think this needs some time to cool off and age, it had much more of an alcohol presence than I remembered. I have a good amount of this tucked away and I plan to try one each year to see the difference. I still say though that this is worth the hype and if you like quads you should track one down. 1,358 charactersmgp2675, Jul 06, 2012

So I got this from my father whose friends went abroad and brought him back a 6 pack of this from a Dutch beer store. Why they heck they didn't keep any of it for themselves defies explanation. But I was blessed to split a bottle of this with my father to celebrate my graduation from my masters degree program.
Poured into a Chimay glass:
Appearance: Dark brown with ruby highlights and thicky creamy head. Slightly cloudy and decent lacing on the glass as the beer was consumed.
Smell: Definite alcohol aromas present. Smells of coffee and toffee, proably from malt and sugar mingle with aromas of figs and raisins likely yeast esters. Could smell this all night.
Taste: Definite yeast characteristics dominate. Fruity and malty and some alcohol present as well, but not overpoweringly and works with the malt and sugar present, slight cocoa and nutty notes.
Mouthfeel: Creamy with a dry finish. Definite prickles from carbonation.
Overall: Wonderfully complex with a lot of layers. Definitely a beer that is enjoyable young but will age well. One that should be shared with good friends or company, with people who appreciate good beer. Had a wonderful warm belly feeling after sharing half of this. 1,254 charactersBrianBoruma, Jul 05, 2012

A: Dark brown, bordering on black, seemingly cloudy.
S: Spice, dried fruits, nuts, and no hot alcohol which many 10% beers can display.
T: Very raisiny and super complex with wood and spice, the flavor bounces all over the place creating happiness everywhere. Upon completion of the swallow the level of alcohol became pretty apparent, but not displeasing. 
M: Of the quads I have had, this is undoubtably the best. Level of alcohol is masked quite well, the flavors are extremely complex and blend together perfectly, and the carbonation is spot on for the style.

Plum, raisin cake, brandy barrel, caramelized sugar, carob and sandalwood – different every sniff.
Brown sugar, rum, sultana, dates, some butter, more plums, with some light spice to finish.
Butter toffee ending, a clove hit and spiced plum linger.
Incredibly creamy, medium, slight warmth, very soft.
The creamiest beer I’ve ever tasted – truly extraordinary mouthfeel. Flavors are not super deep – I suspect this is a bit green. Surprise is how amazingly drinkable it is – 10% doesn’t show up at all.

Well, here goes...
A: Pours a murky super dark brown with just a hint of light at the edges with backlighting. Nice 1 inch bubbly light tan head. At the end of the pour arrives some nice brown-black sludgey yeast amalgam. Excellent retention. Faint silky lacing on the glass.
S: Nice fresh belgian yeast and spice, dark dried fruit (especially raisin), cinnamon, candi sugar, and clove. I think I was expecting to get my socks knocked off, but the aroma is not overpowering. Instead it is wonderfully fresh, straight-forward, and restrained.
T: Wow! Wonderfully complex...takes a few sips to get a good handle on this one. Opens with a bitter charred wood note quickly followed by belgian yeast, clove, dark dried fruit, cinnamon, spicy black pepper, and dark dry chocolate. Hints of caramel malt and candi sugar. Notes of aged port and wine play throughout. Simply worldclass. With warming, molasses and sweet tobacco notes emerge.
M: Dry and bitter up front. Turns toward silky smooth and a bit creamy in the middle. Then finishes light and slightly sticky sweet with nice lengthy lingering on the palate (which is tremendously pleasant--sweet and dark notes predominate--and lasts forever...quite a treat). Medium body...which belies the 10.2% ABV.
D: Simply a tremendous brew. This is some magic act...the 10.2% ABV is imperceptible (well, at least not until after you finish the bottle and have time to let the beer settle in). Hands down the easiest beer to drink over 10%. It lived up to the hype, which is hard to do. This one does not hit hard with the first sip...it grows on you, opens up, and by the time you finish the bottle you then realize what you just drank. I'm looking forward to aging my other bottles and comparing notes over time.
1/2/14: Enjoyed another one (from same batch using snifter as well) today. Amazingly similar to this review...nearly imperceptibly changed. This one holds up extremely well with aging!
12/15/14:  Sampled another one in a snifter from the same batch.  More dark dried fruit in aroma and taste.  Still lots of sweet spice and good complexity.  You can tell this has mellowed and softened a bit now.  Not as fresh as previous tastings.
1/11/16: Enjoyed another one (from same batch using snifter as well) today.  Appearance fairly similar to original review, but head is weaker, doesn't last as long, and doesn't leave much lacing.  Raisins, bready yeast, and sweet spice on the nose.  Follows aroma fairly closely, some vanilla, soft clove...the chocolate and wood notes are gone. Soft feel...definitely has mellowed with age.  Alcohol is more present than with previous tastings.  Still a good beer, but definitely past peak (and past it's best by date).  I'm glad I didn't wait any longer to have this last one. 2,851 charactersmwilbur, Jun 19, 2012

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was one of THE best Belgian Quads I've ever had. I tried a Rocherfort 10, and the spectrum of balance and flavor doesn't compare to the slightest. But the price different would make some people beg to differ.
The pour was pretty epic, it was out of the bottle, I purchased a 6 pack. I bought their brick box, so I received the two chalices to go along with the tasting. It pours a very dark caramel color, and even if you put it up to the light, you're not seeing through it lol.
I had my first smell, and I smelt oakey smells. Definitely an ingredient to this brew. It was aged for 2 years in a Belgian cellar before I received it, so it really had a chance to ferment. The expiration was 2014. There wasn't too much of a head for very long, but it had a little bit of lacing on the top.
Since it had aged for 2 years, it wasn't as carbonated as I had hoped for. But I wasn't expecting it to be honest, as it IS a Belgian Quad. 
I had a lot of hype leading up until my first sip, and I believe it held its own. The first sip, I got was oakey, and VERY malty/bitter, with a hard winey after taste because of the 10.2% ABV that comes along with the beer.
Presentation was great, all brown bottle with Westvleteren XII on the front, with a trappist ring. Proving it is still a competitive world class beer. Great opportunity and it has really gave me a great outlook on Belgian beers. 1,392 charactersRaiden805, Jun 07, 2012
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a rich, dense dark velvet brown into a chalice. 2 inch foamy head dissipates very slowly into an inch cream lace.
Sweet grapes, with some figs on the nose, very subtle and very inviting.
Extremely chewy on the palate, sweet malts, brown sugar flavors with grapes and raisins in there also, mixed in with the spices making it one damn complex brew! Just amazing!
Alcohol creeps up, warming the body, very soothing.
An extremely amazing beer! Hail to the Trappist Monks of Belgium, once again and always!!
Could not recommend this one enough!

4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Decided I'd open this for my birthday beer.
11.2oz beer poured into snifter. Dated 18.04.15 on cap. Ordered from Etre about two weeks ago.
A- Pours a fairly opaque (slightly translucent in not as wide of a glass) dark mahogany brown with a reddish tinge, about a finger of foamy and fairly bubbly yellowish brown yeasty looking head that fades to about a quarter of a finger, about average carbonation to maybe slightly above carbonation. Leaves nice foamy lacing.
S- Definitely very aromatic, sweet, and complex. Definite floral notes with figs, molasses, honey, brown sugar, brandy, baker's yeast, and much more all combining to form a complex sweet aroma that is very pleasant to smell. This is ideally what I think a beer should smell like. I could easily sit here all day trying to distinguish what smells make up this aroma.
T- Sweet molasses, brown sugar, some yeast that gives it a very light bready component which comes out a little bit more as it warms up, brandy, a nice sweet aftertaste. Again sweet and complex, a tad bit less so then the aroma though.
M- A very tiny bit too much carbonation when first opened (letting it sit for 5-10 minutes definitely solved this), but otherwise perfect. Not syrupy, a little bit on the lighter side for a quad and a beer of 10.2%, extremely smooth, abv almost nonexistent.
O- This was a fantastic beer that definitely lived up to it's hype. Definitely by far the best Quad I've ever had. The beer was very complex, while everything balanced perfectly into a great beer. The only beer that I like more then this is Heady Topper, but that's partially because I prefer DIPAs over Quads. I can see why this one of the top rated beers in the world. Definitely would love to try this beer again. Maybe with a little bit more age on it. 1,787 charactersjaasen64, Jun 04, 2012

# 1- Poured into a Chimay goblet. Bottled November 2008.
Deep brown in the middle but brighter around the edges. Thin, wispy head over half the beer with a thick-ish ring of retention holing well. A few drippy spots of lace, too.
The aroma started out incredibly bready - freshly baked, lightly buttered and grainy. Something akin to sugar-drizzled pecans. As it warms, fruit tones emerge - baked apples, tart and still green. Suggestions of black raspberry jam. Biscuit, toffee and candy corn. Very pleasant.
The flavors are much more integrated than the aromas, balanced and blended. Lots of lightly toasted bread; nicely grainy. Toffee and the faintest caramel. I'm shocked at how fruit this isn't; then again, that's probably the reason I like it. Not spicy, either.
The feel is full, though it has watery edges. Carbonation is low. While this isn't the smoothest, the feel is very fluid regardless in spite of a graininess.
~~~
# 2- Poured into a La Chouffe tulip. Bottled February 2009.
The appearance is is a swamp water bogged wooden brown; dulled and dense. It's an ugly color. Sediment is suspended throughout. Poured a 1/3rd inch head that hold 1/4th inch retention - quite impressive in that regard. One thick drip of lace. 
The nose finds tart and tangy fruit notes - over-ripe apple, especially. Pear, too. Undertones of baked and toasted bread with spicy yeast tones. Buttered biscuit even deeper down. Sugary pastry notes. A vapid, dry aroma catches my attention from time to time. Faint banana. Smooth butter toffee as it warms.
The flavor has an overarching sense of dirt and earth, which turns to dry bread notes - simultaneously fluffy and yeasty. Surprisingly, fruit esters take a back seat. Toasted sugars on the back end aren't terribly sweet - more rounded than anything. 
The body is a bit on the plump side of medium. Any smoothness is aggravated by a modest carbonation up top and sandy, granular underpinnings. Warming. Spicy finish with alcohol residuals.
~~~
Overall impression: Neither vintage was what I was expecting; I figured this would be a far more potent beer. These two bottles don't even seem like the same beer, they're so different. I like #1 better but, in terms of style, it's for all the wrong reasons. 2,302 charactersRyan011235, May 26, 2012

11.2oz bottle served in a snifter glass. best before bottle date 13.08.11
pours an opaque mahogany tone with a solid finger of lush, creamy head... slowly fades to a thin cap, collar around the glass; decent lacing. good dose of sediment.
nose is headlined by dark fruits, with notes of spice, brown sugar and caramel malts; definitely a sweet aroma. very nice. slight but perceivable presence of booze. flavor follows the nose. again, dark fruits - raisin, plum, cherry; brown, maybe carmelized sugar; belgian yeast... very balanced, very complex. also happens to be quite delicious. some warming alcohol in the finish.
medium bodied with adequate carbonation. insanely drinkable, i could happily drink this all day. 
worthy to note that there was no eureka moment upon first sipping it, but as you drink, the brew really opens up. hands down a world class beer, but THE best? hmm... not sure i could give any beer that distinction. were rochefort 10 as difficult to come by i think it would marshall a similar hype. that said, it's easily a top 5 candidate in my book.

Cap Code - 16.06.13
A - Slightly more than finger's worth of rich creamy velvety light cream colored froth with a couple of medium sized bubble mixed in for good measure... There is a bit of an audible fizz... Modest retention gives way to a full lacing of identical characteristics... Lightly carbonated with a few small streaks of rapid paced carbonation seen within.. The color is a medium to dark brown that lets bits of light in at angles... The delicate lacing clings to the sides of the glass... 
S - Wonderfully sweet aroma... Loads of dark fruit are at the forefront... Raisins... Dates... Fig... Plums... Brown sugar... Molasses... Light toffee notes... Some light dark bread undertones... A bit of Belgian yeast and booze lie further beneath the surface... Complex and completely satisfying... 
T - The expected dark fruits lead the charge... Riasins... Plums... Figs... Dates... Then comes the additional malt sweetness... Caramel... Toffee... Brown sugar... Molassess... Then emerges light of tobacco... A bit of eye heat and booziness on the finish that is potent, but never overwhelming... On the very deep finish are some very very light peppery notes which are a bit surprisingly, but compliment this brew wonderfully... Layers and richness and complexity... 
M - In the lighter side of full bodied... Uber lush... Uber rich... Uber creamy... Surprisingly light... Starts sharp with a touch of dryness... The finish is ever so slightly chalky yet saliva producing... An excellent and complex mouthfeel that delights with each sip... 
D - This one lives up to the hype... After 974reviews, I have finally found the elusive perfect 5... This one exceeds lofty expectations in all categories... So tasty and satisfying, it's hard not to gulp this one down... A truly satisfying and enriching reward for any BA who has the honor of putting their lips to this fine offering... Complex and completely satisfying in all facets... Now if I could only get another bottle... 2,195 charactersphilbe311, May 23, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served in my trusty Westy chalice; pours a deep brown with a big tan tightly bubbled head, fades to the edges and leaves a nice lacing. Held to the light, the body is a beautiful cherry amber, clear save for a small amount of setiment at the bottom.
A-The nose is a luscious blend of dark, dried fruits, and an unidentified wood; oak? Much yeast in the nose with fruits such as prune, fig, and raisin.
T-The taste is completely blended, there are no layers of individual flavors. The initial flavor is kind of sweet up front, but quickly begins to dry out. A light touch of effervescent which I find is typical or bottle fermented Belgian Ales, and I love it. The palate is sweet and yeasty and a blend of darkish fruits like the prune, fig, and raisin I got in the nose. The whole flavor profile seems to settle right on the center of my tongue, lingering with a hint of dryness. Like a good Belgian, Westy warms beautifully, bringing out even more of the tangy yeasty sour goodness.
M-The mouthfeel is barely carbonated, but silky smooth, and heavy. 
O-Head and shoulders above all other Quads, Trappists definitely included. Westy 12 finishes beautifully, much to my sadness, because I really didn’t want this wonderful Belgian beer to end. A true Trappist quadrupel, bless those monks. For a high ABV, Westy 12 is very drinkable, and I could easily put a couple of these away 1,381 charactersmtbdonn, May 19, 2012
4.45/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5bottle poured into tulip - thanks to Brabander
Pours a deep, dark almost black color with some purple and reddish hues. Thick crop of lightly tanned head rests on top, retaining exceptionally well, lasting throughout the entire pour. Sticky lacing littered across the glass. 
Bold and robust in the nose with a warming bouquet of fruits. Dates and figs with some caramelized tones and a light whiff of burnt sugar. Soft boozy glow, tempered by rich layers of malty complexity. 
Plenty of dark fruit layers up front, weaving flavors of dates, figs and raisins together. Candied and caramelized notes with a decent amount of sweetness and a touch of burnt sugar. Thick malty backbone with some caramel and heavy bready tones. Dark and roasty for a brief moment. Finishes with a warm boozy spike and some residual sweetness. 
Fuller body, decent carbonation, thick and full on the tongue. It's fair to say this lives up to the hype, although it's difficult to say that it's worth the price when St. Bernardus and Rochefort are sitting on shelves everywhere. 1,058 charactersxnicknj, May 19, 2012

T - Very complex. Up front there's nice bready malt with toffee and rich dark fruits. Then comes some tart green apples and a bit of spice from the yeast. Finishes a bit warming that brings a nice carmel/toffee sweetness and slight tartness that lasts and lasts.

03.03.13, I believe that makes it a 2010 bottle, but I could be wrong
A huge thanks to muskiesman for sending my all time #1 want over in a trade.
A: Pours a hazy dark mahogany brown, with a huge 2.5+ fingers width of bubbly yet dense light khaki colored head.  The head hangs around forever, literally taking almost 10 min to dissipate down to a drinkable level of 1/2 a finger, which remains throughout the entire drink.  A few sedimentation particles can be seen suspended in the glass.  Lots of lacing clings to the glass.  Great looking beer. 
S: Dark fruits, with notes of fig, dates and some over ripe plum.  Caramel, burnt sugar, molasses, a little bit of spice, and a touch of bakers chocolate round out the nose. Incredible.  
T: Nectar of the gods indeed!  Incredible from the first sip.  Dark fruits, again with dates and fig, along with raisin notes.   Candied sugars, caramel, bakers chocolate, some spice, a touch of hop bitterness.  The degree of spice is significantly more than the nose, and includes characteristics of  ground pepper and hints of clove.  There is a small booze presence that acts as a balancing agent.  A terrific balance with sweetness, spice, a touch of bitterness and a hint of booze, and an  incredible complexity.  Wow.  
M/D: Wonderfully smooth. Full bodied with an appropriate low carbonation.  A somewhat sticky almost chewy mouthfeel, which coats the palate very nicely.  Has a whole body warming characteristic.  ABV is wonderfully restrained and drinkability is superb.  Pretty perfect here.  
O: Overall, what a fantastic offering.  How can a beer with such a high reputation live up to the hype?  Im not sure, but it does. From start to finish just incredible in almost every aspect.  Is it the best beer in the world?  Impossible to tell, as with all the different styles, and personal presences, it's an almost arbitrary distinction.  That being said, I would have to say its probably the best beer I have ever had the pleasure of drinking, and if not number 1, certainly in the top 2-3.  World class.   2,132 characterszac16125, May 05, 2012

Consumed 4/28/12
Note: I've wanted to try this for years (not that I am alone in this aspect), and this is truly an epic occasion
Appearance: Pours a cloudy brown color with some orange highlights - a gigantic head forms from a gentle pour, slowly fades to a remarkably thick cap - fluffy, absurdly creamy head, just looks pretty
Smell: Rich layers of Belgian yeast, spices, dark fruits, and malts - Belgian yeast tartness with some gentle clove - the fruity esters here are ridiculous - just about every dark fruit I can even identify, like grapes, figs, dates - lighter fruits, too, including cherries - some fruity sweetness - deep malts, very cooked, with caramel and molasses - a slight touch of port-like booze
Taste: Majestic- a nice, dry tartness that comes from a ton of dark fruit flavors - figs, dates, cherries, some spices, but surprisingly not a Belgian yeast bomb - on the sweet side, but not excessively sweet, and it's nicely balanced by some bitterness - dry molasses, toffee, caramel, with a touch of alcohol - very complex, but actually not as deep as the lovely aroma
Mouthfeel: Nearly full body, smooth, a little dry, creamy and great carbonation
Overall: Damn you monks!
Well, this lives up to the reputation. This is a fantastic quad. So many fruity esters, a great malt profile, and some bitterness that holds everything together. My only complaint is that it's has a little too much dry booze. This is pretty magical, but it's not the best beer I've ever had. I think this is a good thing, as this is not exactly easy to get. 1,605 charactersangrybabboon, Apr 28, 2012

Appearance: Deep chocolate brown with garnet hues. Relatively clear with a slight chill haze. Pours with a huge khaki/tan head that persists. Head is creamy, bubbly, and thick. Some spotty lacing. This is what the style should be. 
Smell: Plums and other dark fruit. Big bite of alcohol with a nice level of yeast influence. Notes of clove and banana along with a spicy estery backing. Some caramel. Loads of heat from the booze. Bread dough and malty sweetness. Raisins and a touch of red wine and oak. Very complex without being aggressive. Great depth. Spicy and sweet. 
Taste: Raisins soaked in alcohol. Bready and caramel sweetness. Figs, plums, and hints of ripe cherry. Yeast is aggressive hitting big spicy clove notes with touches of banana. Loads of alcohol heat. Candi sugar sweetness. Very clean and complex. So much ripe fruit. It works really well with yeast strain. Sugar runs the gamut from caramel to toffee and ending just over the line of molasses. Manages to avoid becoming cloying. Estery spices and a big yeast work well with the overall sweetness. 
Mouthfeel: Lighter than expected with a lively carbonation. Medium body and a very clean finish especially for the style. Drinks smooth and a touch creamy. 
Overall: This is the best Belgian beer I've ever encountered. Loads of depth and complexity without being too much. Nice balance and the clean finish is damn impressive. Is it the best beer in the world, no. Is it damn good and worth drinking, absolutely. 1,526 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Apr 28, 2012

A - A dark copper amber. A nice thick, frothy head with optimal lacing. Stunning.
S - So soft on my nose. Some dry sweetness, near no hop profile whatsoever. The best way I can describe this is by summoning the scent of a fresh loaf of bread, but beer!
T - Fantastic collection of spices, tingling my palette in ways I previously could not imagine. Bready malts and ripe dark fruits follow and the Westy finishes with a crisp and warm sensation. Top class!
M - Medium body which is rich, smooth and creamy. This defines a perfect mouthfeel. While it could be more stout/bold, this is refined excellence.
O - This lives up to the hype, I raise my glass to the Trappist monks of Westvleteren. Their passionate brewing has been transcribed into their product and warrants its throne atop the beer world. 946 charactersmscudder, Apr 28, 2012

Upon drinking, I was so happy that I started giggling like a little girl. That's how good this stuff is. The taste is right in line with the smell, grapes, raisins, and a floral aroma. It feels great in my mouth and settles well in my stomach.

Appearance: It has a nice cloudy dark brown color to it. It has a nice creamy beige head that dies down slowly and leaves nice lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of dark fruit, mainly plums and raisins, with brown sugar, spices, bready notes and belgian yeast. 
Taste: Like the aromas, it has that complex fruity character with a mild spiciness, bready yeast notes, caramel/brown sugar sweetness and a mild bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: It has a medium carbonation with a great overall balance, feel and complexity.
Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. 639 charactersSebD, Apr 22, 2012

A: Single finger head, decent retention, creamy off-white color settling to a thin white film. The body itself is deep rusty colored brew that is partly cloudy, but still allowed you to see bubble rising to the top.
S: Cherries, grain, dark fruits, belgian yeat, green apples and other tart notes. High ABV was surprisingly not detectable.
T: Did a side by side with Rochefort 10 and Abt 12. I found the Westy to be the winner due to its subtle richness and high level of drinkability. I detected hints of cherry, but much more in the grain and dark fruit department.

4.43/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 2007 vintage bottle (33cl) at Akkurat; murky brown with a concerted cloudy core, a tan light foam rests at the surface consisting of tiny bubbles. Perceptible sediments in the glass. Polite medium intensity nose with multiple layered odor of massive licorice aroma, refreshing cola syrup, chocolate pudding, butterscotch and a hint of fruit, raisins mostly. Along with superb complexity this beer brings synergy to my nose each time I sense it. The beer is full bodied, mouth filling and silky. The high alcohol is not quite evident and malty taste above and beyond the perfect equilibrium of bitterness and sweetness brings this beer into sum balance. Caramelized tones, licorice, butterscotch, dried fruit, cacao, cola syrup and some tiny hints, symptomatic of bubblegum summer berries. This beer is outstanding, and yet I feel there's something missing. The concentration is outstanding, but not extravagant. This is surely a masterpiece, but I'm not blown away. Perhaps my expectations were excessively high for this legend of a beer, lacking a bit of feel and extraordinary touch. http://quaffable.org/?p=32 1,126 charactersdln646, Apr 16, 2012

4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This bottle, dated 20.5.14, was bottled on May 20, 2011 as the dating looks 3 years out and is a freshness guide, although let's face it, a quad of this quality can age gracefully for decades. Westy 12 pours a fantastic burgundy brown with nice hints of light amber and caramel brown. A nice big 3 finger tannish, bone colored head sits atop the beer that has pretty decent retention, leaves behind a lot of film atop the beer and around the glass, but also yields a fair amount of soapy lacing. The aroma is wonderful, lots of tart dark fruit, cherries, plums, some prune, that is balanced with some caramel sweetness that also brings out some brown sugar and a bit of the alcohol, but in a nice smooth way rather than something more abrasive and hot. Lastly, there is a great amount of that famous Belgian yeast in the nose that really ties everything together. The flavors are exceptionally complex, nice raisiny start that gets very bready right away, the yeast really comes out and with it, come a variety of wonderful flavors. Tart notes of cherry, plum and dark grape, some smokey tobacco and leathery flavors, some brown sugar, alcohol and caramel also come around at the end that gives the beer a nice smooth sweet finish. Every sip yields more flavor, more complexity and enhances the overall experience. The body is great, higher than expected carbonation, but still big, thick, and smooth, yet finishes quite dry. 
Verdict: Simply sublime. I may not consider it the best beer in the world, but it has earned its reputation as one everyone should make a point to try in their lifetime. The flavors are balanced so well and have seemingly endless complexity, definitely worth the effort to get. 1,705 characterskevanb, Apr 10, 2012

after the raffles were called, the table next to ours won the trappist collection. upon reception of their winnings, they immediately cracked open this behemoth. the kind, classy, lovely people shared with us.
still and dark. no head in my glass. a dark brown with some purple hues. no lacing really or residue left on the glass.
my god. smelled so strongly of prunes, dates, raisins, molasses. it smelled like brandy. so potent. this, i imagined, is what a quad should smell like. i smelled this one for at least five minutes. unreal concentration of fruit/alcohol. unbelievable.
stop everything. all of it. big and bold. sweet and smooth. this is brandy without the booze. this is cognac without the bite. the smell/taste correlation for this beer is astounding. prune, fig, date, plum, brown sugar, molasses, honey, light booze, all in the highest and most pleasurable regard. fucked up.
the feel on this one is so pure; that is, for all the powerful flavors and sweetness, it finishes so cleanly, smoothly, and not at all too powerfully based on the fruit flavors present. the drink is smoother than any quad i've had.
i didn't know when i'd have this. i certainly did not expect to have it shared from complete strangers, though it was monk's, and any good beer lover knows damn well that the only way to drink a truly special beer is to share it with others in accord. thank you so much for sharing that. 
i also didn't have any idea how i'd respond to this beer. quads are not a style that i go out for. this is an exception: the prowess, quality, history alone can curb you.
i DEFINITELY did not think this would touch its reputation; however, and i must rethink the concept of "hype," this did not expand on its legend, it completely overhauled it, going above and beyond what i expected. 
absolutely incredible. here's more for the hype machine.

A - Pours a clear red-tinged brown with one finger of tan head that has very good retention.
S - Lots of dark fruits, sweet caramel malt and bread. Very nice.
T - Starts a bit on the sweet side, with caramel, dark dried fruits and some burnt brown sugar. From midway through the finish, taste turns spicy and earthy, with considerable bitterness on the finish.
M - Incredibly smooth and creamy initially, gradually transitioning to a bit prickly, then finishing earthy and dry. Some mildly numbing alcohol on the finish.
O - Excellent beer? Yes. Light years ahead of the Rochefort 10 I can buy any day of the week? No, but I did have a Rochefort 10 immediately after this and it was considerably sweeter than the Westy 12. Sadly, I may not have the chance to have a nicely aged bottle for comparison. Overall, this was spicier and more bitter than I was expecting (in a good way) and thoroughly enjoyable. 995 characterswarnerry, Apr 06, 2012

Bottle to Bruery Tulip

I didnt save the cap, dont remember the date.
Thanks to lcmir23 for this one
Shared with Gurudel for his birthday.
App- A very dark brown with some amber highlights in the glass. Fairly thick and didnt let a lot of light through. A nice puffy 1-1/2 finger head with some good stick and cling.
Smell- A very aromatic quad. Has a great layer on the nose of sweetness, malts and the ABV is completely hidden. The beer as it warms creeps with more dark fruits and gets more complex.
Taste- This was my 3rd bottle of this one and I have to say this was the best one yet. Had a good complex flavor with some sweetness and the dark fruits shined. Much like the nose the ABV is really hidden well.
Mouth- A medium body with a medium carbonation level. Good residual dark fruits and some sweetness.
Drink- Great beer, hard to get but worth the experience at least once. 917 charactersFosterJM, Apr 01, 2012

Poured into a Duvel tulip. A deep reddish-brown - tons of yeast sediment slide into the glass as I empty the bottle. Yields a decent head of creamy tan foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding. An opulent aroma of sweet, fruity goodness: plums, figs, dried fruit, molasses, brown sugar and yeast. A warm, port-like booziness rounds it off.
Tastes of rich, sweet malt with a complex, fruity character. Notes of plums, dried fruit, brown sugar, molasses, port/sherry and a hint of dry yeast. A warming alcoholic finish with a spicy, astringent character and a hint of grain. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, with tingly carbonation and a prickly sensation from the alcohol. Highly astringent; dries the palate. Aftertaste of sweet, boozy fruitiness.
Impressive - a beer with a big character. Sweet, fruity booze; it's almost like sherry in flavour. Not sure that I would rate this as the greatest beer in the world, but it's certainly a show-stopper. Perhaps I'll revisit after a few hundred more reviews and see if a revision is needed. Definitely one to seek out and sample. 1,279 charactersjazzyjeff13, Apr 01, 2012

To be savored like a fine congac. 
Thick, rich dark fruit. It reminds me of my mother's mince pie
with the bourbon soaked raisins. The ageless love of the art over the generations is realized on the tongue.
I had my first one at at Au Bon Vieux Temps in the center of Brussels. A tiny old place with a tiny crowd at 9 on a Tuesday night. But didn't get to fully appreciate with a cold.
The one I brought home though (one of several including the W8 reviewed here, all purchased at De Bier Temple) was opened at the most opportune time and therefore fully appreciated.
It merits it's revered status but probably best in moderation as an occasional treat. I would be in trouble if this was my refrigerator brew. 763 charactersheymikew, Mar 31, 2012

Cap is dated 15.06.14.
Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy 2 inch khaki head that settles to a puffy cap on top of the beer. Thick foamy chunks of lace cling to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and a variety of fruit aromas: grape juice, grape jelly/jam, dark fruits. Taste is of raisin bread, brown sugar, burnt caramel, dark fruits, grape juice, and a kick of alcohol on the finish. The alcohol is warming in the back of the throat after each sip and a slight amount of bitterness as well. This beer has a bubbly level of carbonation with a crisp and slightly drying mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fantastic beer and very worthy of its reputation. The carbonation level seems a wee bit high but that is of minor concern. I am thrilled that I finally got to try this beer. 887 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 29, 2012

A: Pours a cloudy, tobacco brown with ruby highlights around the edges. A huge cream three finger cream colored head. The head is extremely uniform and tight. Some of the tightest and finest lacing I have ever seen adorns the edges of the glass. Just a wonderful and classic looking quad here.
S: Oh wow. Honey, clove, banana, cherry, fig, prune, dates. Hints of caramel and supple leather. Lots of biscuit malt notes blend perfectly with all of the ripe fruit. Smells a lot like iced vanilla cake. Amazing. Perfect.
T: Creamy bread crust, cherry, vanilla, some caramel and traces of tobacco. Belgian spice and yeast are well incorporated and assertive, but they don't dominate. I mostly get sweet fruits and fresh bread. A little bit of booziness on the finish. 
M: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Very creamy mouthfeel. Flavors are perfectly balanced.
O: A little booziness is the only thing that holds this back from being perfect. It was evident to me why this is the standard from the minute I poured it...the color, consistency, and head on this beer are unequaled. Definitely one for every beer lover to try.

4.57/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Super excited to try this bottle...
Pours a deep, hazy, dark brown with an incredibly foamy, tannish head. The nose is not boozy at all and has a very distinct cherry- breadiness. The smell is super clean and refined, even when it warms there is nothing out of place. It's almost like a freshly baked cherry pie. 
The taste is quite crisp as well. There is a sweet malty body with intense, ripe pit fruits like those detected in the beer's nose. No off flavors appear to be present, but there is a pungent, residual aftertaste. Unfortunately, the tobacco bitterness is a little intense that kind of throws off this beer's clean presentation in the other categories. I would have liked a less intrusive aftertaste, although it's good to know the beer was potent enough to sit on the palate for awhile. Honestly, each sip is different and offers a new level of complexity.
Overall, this beer was hard to get. And at $20/bottle, it's rather expensive as well. I'm glad I tried this beer, but will most likely view it as a novelty than something I'll actively seek out in the future. 1,081 charactersThePorterSorter, Mar 24, 2012

Pours with a voluminous two fingers of dark tan foam, dissipates quickly without much lacing. The body is a nearly opaque dark plum color, hues of dark red.
Smells of dark fruits and berries. Grapes, raisins, cherries, vinous red wine and some tobacco. Also a strong caramel malt backbone to balance.
Taste is very grape-forward, like a port with dark fruits, rum, caramel, finishing dry with a little wood. This beer is so smooth and the alcohol well hidden.
Great mouthfeel for a quad, not too syrupy or heavy. Carbonation is present but soft, and the beer is dry with mild stickiness. Not much alcohol heat either.
I don't think this is the best beer in the world but it's a superb one nonetheless. Very drinkable for a 10.2% quad and not too sweet. It's excellent, highly recommended, and worthy of the acclaim. 879 charactersislandboi8204, Mar 11, 2012

4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5330ml naked bottle, best before Oct 2013, courtesy of tbeckett - cheers, man! I've heard of this Trappist moniker for a while now, so after a bit of googlemappery, it is nice to see that there is indeed a place called 'Vleteren', with a West and of course, an Oost. Nice.
This beer pours a dark, murky, dishwater brown hue, with a fair amount of swirling, suspended sediment, and one ascetic finger of tightly foamy specked beige head, which doesn't wait around for alms, leaving only a few isolated beads of lace around the glass as it quickly bleeds away.
It smells of sharply bready grain - somewhat sourdough-esque, astringent dark sugar, vinous, floral Madeira, fruity prunes, and a slight apple cider tartness. The taste is a whole lot sweeter than the aroma let on - the nose, it seems, doesn't always know. Caramel malt, tempered by a furthered sour bread character, mildly spiced, in a down-low Noel manner, soft, but firm drupe fruitiness, a subtle leafy, herbal hop dryness, and some sneaky, underhanded rum cake booze warming.
The bubbles are quite frankly, all played out, and not very noticeable, excepting the effect they must have in keeping the fruity, medium-heavy body from even dancing near cloyingness, but rather into an abject, enveloping smoothness. It finishes like a well balanced dessert - multifaceted sweetness, well modulated by ethereal hop and alcohol. Bravo.
Well, the hype, she can be one harsh mistress, but this time, she really puts out - a stellar example of the 'quad' style, or what have you. Complex, balanced, strong yet soft, and beguiling. Like the beer itself, I took a wee spell to warm up, but once it got going, it was very hard to stop. Taken as part of my Winter 2012 Quad Tasting - a rather pushed forward affair, seeing how our 'winter' has petered out this year (spring-like weather in my hood in early March is quite unusual), here's how the Westy 12 fared against its nearest locally available competition:
Westvleteren 12: as above.
Rochefort 10: complex, yessiree - but in a somehow more simple (mea culpa) manner, i.e. - your stellar, GGG wife, until you are presented with the idea of that SI swimsuit model of a particular adolescent fantasy. 
St. Bernardus ABT 12: everything going for it to compete, except for the big step up in complexity that the Westy presents. Nothing bad to say - just another subtle reminder of that 'there'll always be someone bigger and/or stronger' maxim of life.
So, after all that - mere tenths of rating points divide this hedonistic, rarified harbinger of kingdom in the sky end days from its slightly more pedestrian brethren - I shall be taking that into consideration as I move forward in the beer-imbibing world. 2,717 charactersbiboergosum, Mar 11, 2012

Pours a rich chocolate brown with reddish hues and wispy cream clouds rather than a head.
The aroma is very strong in there is sherry, molasses, rum, bootleg scrumpy and red diesel.
Taste wise it makes me think barley wine, it hits the tongue like a sherbet coated sugar plum then zings along with dark rum hints continuously warming the mouth.
I can't completely go into all of the flavours going on.
Strange thing is as strong as it is, it isn't heavy, not in mouthfeel or flavour.
Quite lively put without being too fizzy.
Is it the best beer in the world?
Well it is fantastically good, but I think the heavy weight alcoholic strength would make it the world's best strong ale. 740 charactersEmperorBevis, Mar 01, 2012

Pours a medium brown, clouded with some yeast sentiment, moderately firm khaki head, gone quickly leaving spotty lacing. Scent was fantastic, as it brought a wonderfully blended concoction of brown sugar, light molasses, honey, doughy and yeasty undercooked bread, prune, fig, raisin, apple and light spicing. Was expecting a slap in the face from the taste, but was greeted with a smooth, blended combination of the notes from the scent. Bready, fruity, sweet, savory in all the right quantities. Medium bodied, moderately bubbly, better towards the end as carbonation escapes. Overall, a truly exceptionally crafted beer. Always hard to live up to the hype, but in the way everything blends and layers, it is a work of art. 807 charactersrfgetz, Feb 28, 2012

From a tasting on February 19. Poured into my Victory snifter. 
Where to start? Appearance was fantastic. Beautiful deep amber color, clear with chunks of sediment floating in it. 
Aroma consists of ju-jube, dates, white raisins, quite a lot of pitted dried fruitiness going on in there. No hop aroma at all, which was expected.
Taste was bread, yeast, ju-jube, dates, raisins and candy sugar.
Mouthfeel was super creamy and smooth. Virtually no alcohol detected at all, which is amazing considering the ABV. Would describe similar to Rochefort 10 only much smoother and even more complex.
Definitely worth the expense and trouble to give this a try. 826 charactersDaPan, Feb 25, 2012

Appeared a dark brown color with a billowing, 3 finger light brown head.  A bit of haze and some yeast floaties.
Smelled of dark fruits, light spices, and some roasted-ness.  Also a yeasty backbone in the nose.
Taste is delicious and rich.  Some dark fruit and port wine characteristics - reminded me of a Swedish drink called Glug.
Mouthfeel is thick and somewhat subdued on the carbonation.  Quite sweet.  The ABV is hidden.
Solid beer!  The best....maybe not. 521 charactersTWStandley, Feb 21, 2012

Hazy, deep brown pour yields one to two fingers of head with stubborn retention. The four of us participating all remarked on its aroma when smelling the (unbeknownst to us) Westy for the first time. It holds layers upon layers of complexity that the others simply couldn’t match.
The term "bready" is often thrown around, but Westy 12 actually smells like a freshly baked loaf of bread. Surprisingly strong caramel character too with a more tame spiciness than the others. As stated, we all agreed that this was the best aroma of the bunch.
Extremely complex flavor profile without an over-reliance on the style’s traditional spice characteristics. Tons of caramel (again) atop an already intriguing set of flavors. Bready. Significantly more interesting than the others. Finishes slightly sweet with lingering caramel amidst the boozy warmth.
Westy 12 sports a fuller body than its peers; noticeably more luscious and creamy than the others. Plenty of carbonation, but not too much.
Despite everything I've written, I can't drink this the way I do stouts or sours. It's become grueling for me to drink a Belgian these days, though this is certainly my favorite non-sour Belgian. The monks at Westvleteren deserve the hype they’ve earned over the years. Not the best beer in the world, but I'm rating to style and this is unquestionably the best Belgian Quad in the world -- particularly with a few years of age. I've since had Westy 12 fresh and, while it was still great, it couldn't compare to this ~3-year-old bottle.
...and in case you're wondering, my order of preference ended up being: Westy 12, Malheur 12, Abt 12, and finally Rochefort 10. Cheers! 1,837 charactersbrystmar, Feb 13, 2012

A: Murky ice tea color. Tons of carbonation streaming up to form a nice foamy light tan head, looks like a head on a nice oatmeal stout. Great head retention, decent lacing. Love that color.
S: Bready, floral and dark fruits (mainly figs and plums). Some tart apples, thought the nose would be a bit stronger, but still good.
T: Wow! So complex. So smooth. Up front there's nice bready malt with toffee and rich dark fruits. Again, plums, figs and prunes? Then comes some tart green apples and a bit of spice from the yeast. Finishes a bit warming that brings a nice carmel/toffee sweetness and slight tartness that lasts and lasts. It literally makes your mouth water after each sip.
 It's incredibly hard to pin down all the flavors since there is so much going on.
M: Mouthfeel is awesome. High on the medium side, with a lot of carbonation, but its not prickly. Weird since it's so smooth, like liquid velvet.
O: In one word; phenomenal. Awesome drinkability and the ABV is hidden pretty well. I was a little concerned about the hype, but this lived up to it for sure. 1,154 charactersherman77, Feb 12, 2012

S: A malty smell with a hint of hops. The smell consists of molasses and dark fruit, as well as a refined, thick and sweet alcohol flavour.
T: There is a strong, in-your-face alcohol taste. It is quite sweet, with a non-bitter liquorice flavour, and there are lots of molasses and fruit present. Burnt sweetcorn and sugar cane also present on the edges. Too strong in my opinion.
M: Very smooth with good carbonation. The beer just seems to go down.
O: This is one oddly addictive beer. After sipping you just want more. If this was readily available I would have this quite often. 715 charactersGary779, Feb 09, 2012
4.08/5  rDev -11.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I was going to save this for a special review number, like review #600 or something. But screw that, welcome to review #537!
11.2oz. bottle -- the versions in the bricks w/ the gold etched labeling; cap dated 02.09.14 -- poured into a Duvel tulip
Pours out a dark breadcrust. This isn't beer whose color looks like a dark breadcrust. No, this just looks like a dark breadcrust. It's so opaque! You don't see through it at all. Less than one finger of head, but oh is that creme foam so tightly composed. Very small, fine bubbles. Spots and arcs of lacing make a bunch of abstract happy faces on the sides of the glass.
I didn't come into this beer expecting to be blown away by it or expecting it to hammer me over the head with obvious flavor. I was expecting subtlety, refinement. And I got it in the aroma. It smells like you're a block away from a neighborhood that has both a flower shop and a bread bakery. There's lots of straight-up delicious bread aroma here, but there's all these scents of flower petals and spices (clove, cardamom). I get traces of old dates too; not fresh ones, but old ones. That's neat. There's also a cookie dough aroma... or something. It smells close to that, anyway -- a mix of sweet dough and dairy.
The flavor is not what I expected, though I think that owes to just how fresh this bottle is. An older bottle will be more developed than this. Regardless, here's what I'm tasting. The initial flavor is bread and fruitcake: all malty and sweet. It's a lovely malt profile, but it quickly gets masked by the alcohol. It's surprisingly astringent here, and the tip of my tongue is nearly numbed by its potency. During the midpalate is when the yeast strain starts to take over. It's like a rambunctious toddler at this point in the beer's life. It's forceful and bratty. There's a cloves & band-aid phenols component that absolutely takes over the midpalate. Despite the sweet flavors, this is pretty dry due to those phenols. The yeast then throws out mint all over the place as you transition to the finish. The finish yields this brief flirtation with a grapes & vanilla flavor that I've never quite tasted before ending up with a lingering version of where it started: sweet, slightly fruity bread-based dessert. 
The mouthfeel is this beer's biggest strength, at least at this stage. It's so, so smooth. A perfect level of carbonation. I happen to like drier beers, so I enjoy how relatively dry this beer is. I'd score it a 5.0 in mouthfeel if the alcohol weren't so aggressive.
Overall, this is basically the freshest possible Westy you can drink. This is an infant. So this whole review should be taken with that particular grain of salt: this beer will likely be better in a few years. This is just a score for a fresh bottle. I'll age my other bottles and reassess it if need be. As it is, this is a beer that is on-par with the St. Bernardus 12s and Rochefort 10s and De Dolle Oerbiers of the world. With age? I'll find out in a few years. 2,991 charactersReaper16, Feb 09, 2012

11.2 oz bottle at about fridge temp split with a friend, poured into an ommegang goblet. best before 21.09.14 on the cap, labelless bottle.
pours out a dark, murky, reddish- brown color, some yeast sediment is visible. a nice thick 1/4 inch layer or so of slightly off white colored head that stayed the whole glass. good head retention, but only minimal lace from a swirl. 
very vinious and winey, some booze is evident. you really have to let this warm up before it starts to shine, but i still maybe expected a little more to the aroma. once it opens up some light yeasty phenolics and a hint of a brown sugary malt come out. 
much more complex than the aroma suggested. but again, it becomes better and better the more it warms. has a nice sweetness, but at the same time finishes a bit dry. lots of wine like fruits, grapey, vinious, a nice range of subtle spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, a hint of clove, as well as some phenolicy yeast. some nice molasses and brown sugar and just a hint of some dark breads. 
comes off much lighter than you would think. heavier side of medium bodied, a nice fine carbonation. the booze was such well hidden in the taste. 
really such a complex and enjoyable beer, but i was expecting there to be more to it. the taste was prolly the best part about this beer, but IMO this is still on the same level with rochefort and pannepot. im also not sure on exactly how old this bottle is, my guess would be around 1-2 years. with that said, id definately drink this again, but i wouldnt go through any lengths to get it again. still a beer every BA should atleast try once. 1,631 charactersdogfishandi, Feb 07, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5My 250th review has coincided with a beer I've been wanting to try for a long time. Bought as part of the 6 bottle set released to finance renovations at the monastery. Best before date of 21.09.14.
A - Pours into an Oerbier tulip a murky dark brown with burnt orange hues when held to the light. Three fingers of light tan head fall to a frothy cap of a single finger. Small bubbles of carbonation are present, keeping the head firmly in place for a while.
S - Red wine, grapes, cocoa, star anise, clove, leather, woodiness, a boozy kick of dark rum, prunes, dried figs. A heady and enticing blend which is well integrated given its relative youth.
T - Initial caramel is joined by the dark fruit, with spice then taking over towards the middle of the drink. Cocoa moves out from the middle along with molasses and the alcohol warmth of rum builds towards the finish, its heat increasing in the mouth and throat in the aftertaste. Herbal hops keep dryness lingering, counterbalanced by sweet caramel. Would have liked the alcohol to be better masked and I would have thought age will certainly take care of this in part. Plenty of interest and an adept transition of flavours.
M - Full bodied and carbonation is quite sharp and lively for the style, probably due to its freshness. A creamy mouthfeel keeps trying to poke through but as it appears it's continually cut down by the carbonation.
D - No doubt a world class beer, but a question remains as to whether the hype is fully justified when compared to others in the style. Perhaps this is down in part to the relative rarity and therefore premium price point. Unsurprisingly, reminiscent of St Bernadus Abt 12, which whilst being good isn't my favourite of the quads. I'd go as far as to say Rochefort and De Struise offer slightly better beers, as well as being readily available to me and a much more cost effective option. I'll be cellaring a handful to explore how the booze and carbonation mellow and the flavours integrate, as in my estimation a few years will make it outstanding. Despite this, the overall score speaks for itself. Clearly the work of expert hands... 2,136 charactershaz77, Feb 06, 2012
4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Starting off with my first review I thought I would go for the so claimed best beer in the world. Bottle dated 17.08.14 poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance (4): Poured a dark golden brown, non-translucent somewhat murky look. An aggressive pour yielded a 2-3 finger tight small bubbled head. Head retention good throughout the drinking process. Mildly creamy head. Not the prettiest beer in the world IMO but still enticing.
Smell (4.5): Wow, a lot going on in this first initial sniff. Automatically I got plums, raisins, figs, banana bread, slight cherry, and prunes. All the fruity goodness as you would expect with a world class belgian quad. One thing I was expecting was a alcohol scent with the ABV being what it is, 10.2%, but couldn't smell it.
Taste (5): Holy cow, right away you pick up on the palate the smells you took in from the scent. Sweet bread malts, dark sugars, candied raisins, figs, and oddly a tiny cherry twinge. Not cloying whatsoever. Just the right amount of sweetness I care for, its there but not overpowering. A small and I mean small hop flavor comes through in your search for it. Just like in the scent portion of the review the alcohol was hidden and it holds true to the taste. The only time I could pick up on the alcohol was by the time it reached my gut. It would warm your esophagus on the way down and continue through your stomach. Masterfully done, least boozy presence of all the belgian quads I've had.
Mouthfeel (5): Good carbonation, medium body. Has a slight coating tendency but not even close to syrupy thanks to the moderate carbonation. Slight creamy feel, very smooth on the swallow. 
Overall (5): Awesome! Very well balance with the alcohol and deep rich complex flavors keep you searching for something you havent yet tasted. Tasted this with the other 2 big contenders in the belgian quad category, St. Bernies Abt 12 and Rorchefort 10 and have to say the Westy won out. Each of the two aforementioned beers are great without a doubt, but if money was no object I am drinking the Westy over the other two. Will definitely age out the remaining four I have left to see how it matures year by year. Yes, this beer is expensive and hard to get but I have to say I now know what the hype was about. It's a freaking fantastic beer that has made it's way into the top 3 best beer I've ever sampled. Best beer in the world as people say? Cant say, because I havent tried them all! But it is the best belgian ale I've sampled without a doubt. 2,497 charactersLANCENUTTER, Feb 06, 2012

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have had the pleasure of enjoying this beer on a regular basis. Having lived in England for three years, I was able to travel to Belgium and acquire numerous cases of this hard-to-get brew. I drank about half of my stock (about 10 cases total) and have saved and began to age the other half. I break one out and drink it about once a month or so. I am fortunate enough to have tried a variety of Westvleteren 12s, some being as old as 30 years (acquired these from a Belgian teenager who found a couple cases of Westy's in his Grandmas basement!) I have found that the "sweet spot" for these beers is about 5 years old (+/- a year). The beers that fall into this range are perfect. There is not much more to be said, they are the perfect beer. Store these beers right and they will reward you with the best that any beer has to offer. Liquid caramel. Smell, taste, everything is spot on. This beer is rightfully the number one beer in the world. I will continue to make trips to Belgium for the rest of my life to enjoy beers in the cafe (In de Vrede) across the street from the Monastary. 1,091 characters4thelvofbeer, Feb 04, 2012

S- Very sweet dark fruit scent, it smells so good I don't want to stop smelling it. 
T- Oh dear sweet baby Jesus... It's exceeding all expectations. Honestly I'm not a huge fan of quads but this is mind blowing. Sweet dark fruits come into perfect harmony with hops, malts, and alcohol. I could go on all night but just rest assured this is everything it's made out to be.
M- Low carbonation and quite think, which is a great thing given how amazing the flavor is. Definitely a sipper which just makes it last longer. 
O- First when I traded for this I was glad I wouldn't have to take part in the hysteria. Now I think I might have to give my first born for a crate of this. Seek out at any cost! 898 characterspschul4, Feb 01, 2012

4.52/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52009 bottle picked up from the Brewery. It pours mahogany to deep ruby in colour with a thin foamy beige head. The nose is wood, ginger, raisin, fig, date, orange-zest, leather and dark chocolate. The taste unbelievably complex: wood, caramel, toffee, plum, cherry, date, prune, fig, stewed pear, red grape, banana, vanilla, leather, smoke, charcoal, milk and dark chocolate, rich-roast coffee, liquorice, nice alcohol warmth....the list could go on. The underlying sweetness balances the more savoury flavours. It has fine carbonation, a full body, layers of complexity, surprising smoothness and one of the longest finishes around. Awesome. 642 charactersSc0pey, Jan 31, 2012

S: The nose is deep and sweet. Malts, some phenolic esters also but nothing disturbing here. Dark fruits, grapes, raisins, plums, peaches, a bit spicy (cloves) and yeasty. Very complex and hard to describe.
T: Sweet malts, caramel, faint notes of chocolate, lots of dark fruits, cherries, bananas, hints of alcohol. Typical Belgian yeasts bready flavors on the finish. Warming. Slightly bitter.
M: Very carbonated but full bodied.
O: Very complex and well balanced but easy to drink. With 2-3 years on it, definitely one my favorite from the style! 711 charactersFux, Jan 30, 2012

4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow, I was lucky enough to get a bottle made in 2010 and I split it with a friend of mine. This is the best beer I have ever had and I can only hope that I can get my hands on another one before I die. We poured it out of the traditional unmarked bottle into the most ghetto of clear plastic cup, it pains me to even admit that, but good beer will always be good no matter what. It appearance was a dark murk brown and it had a large yellow/brown head. It had a heavy unami aroma that was very pleasant. Up front it has a simple sweet/malty taste with even a hint of raisin while the back-end of it provided a little spice and heat perhaps due to it being aged for two years. I was told to swish it around in my mouth and there was an explosion of flavor as it turned to a cream like consistency. I would also say it had a little bitter and roasty notes throughout the tasting. Would definitely recommend it and I may have to make a trip to Belgium. 949 characterspcents, Jan 30, 2012

The word that best describes this beer - pleasurable. This beer strikes the balance of sweet and beer so perfectly, it literally brought a smile to my face. It is sweet on the front end of the experience with a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is heavy, it turns into thick cream as you swish it around your mouth. There are hints of raisins and plums that give the beer a rich sweetness, that is surely balanced by some mild hoppiness. Heavy carbonation, slightly cloudy, a light head. 
There is a mythical experience that comes with drinking Westvleteren 12 that cannot be understood unless one drinks it. 790 charactersciaomonaco, Jan 30, 2012

Smelled of dark fruits, dark bread, leather, and cherries.

Tight bubbles in carbonation.

4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well I figured I'd make this review count, and get a little cocky and review it before the distribution to the US actually does happen in the Spring of 2012.
12 oz. bottle poured into a Leffe chalice. The cap indicates 16-06-13 as what I would assume is the best bye date. Popped the cap and a small amount of foam started to ball up at the top, waited a minute or 2 for the pour. Sort of a brown dirty water color in the liquid but darker, slightly darker than cider. There is quite a bit of setiment floating around in there, saved a little at the bottom of the bottle so there wasn't too much, but I think it's unavoidable, no big deal. Looks pretty good. Like many Belgian styles, there is a decent sized foamy head, mostly small bubbles but slightly varies. The head is slightly darker than off white. Good looking beer, I wouldn't say it's the best looking beer I've ever seen (even for the style), but you can tell it's quality. 
Took my first sniff from the bottle before I poured it and I couldn't believe how good it smelled; it sort of went away, but it was hoppier than I expected. However the more I smell it, I think it's just it's the fruitiness from the other ingredients. Dark fruits come out, plumb, crushed apples, pears, even cherries. Subtle tropical fruits too. Also hints of mild chocolate and maybe even some coffee. None of those gross banana-like aromas that often apply in many Belgian styles. This is all good all the way. My ONLY knock on this is that it's not that strong, decisive, but nothing not that strong, so I'd give it a 4.75 if possible, but this will do.
Taste is truly outstanding and now I understand the hype. I'm not traditionally one to prefer Belgian style brews to others, but Quads were what I like the most of them all and now I totally understand the hype. All the aromas come out in the flavor here. Very malty and fruity ( I don't feel like typing all the fruits again, so read above). Subtle chocolate again, but a little more bitter this time, slight coffee too. Perfectly balanced between bitter and sweet. I'm not overly versed in the Quad style, but this is worthy of being the standard of how this beer should taste. 
Mouthfeel is perfect, plain and simple. Huge, full flavor while feeling soft and delicate. Great carbonation level and the yeast doesn't leave that ,well "yeasty" feeling in your mouth, it's very smooth. The 10.2% is WELL hidden in the mouthfeel and the flavor, I NEVER would have guessed that if I didn't know. Crazy drinkable too. This is just an all around wonderful beer all around, absolutely happy to have tried it; maybe I'll get the opportunity again. If more Quads tasted like this, it could be my favorite style. 
Huge props to dbexpert, you're the man, thanks a ton for the trade! 2,772 charactersAndyAvalanche, Jan 28, 2012
4.89/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Unknown vintage, although I think it is quite fresh. 
The colour is brown, the liquid a bit cloudy. The low head is off-white, it leaves some nice lacing. 
The smell got a distinct note of sponge-cake dough. Sweet Champagne. Red berries. It is very smooth. 
The taste is first enormously sweet. Then, fruity jam flavours kicks in. Smooth hoppy-hayish notes with very low bitterness. Wheat flour. Some toffee. The aftertaste is tremendously smooth with fruits and herbs in the finish. 
The carbonation is fresh, the bubbles are small. The liquid is smooth and a bit dry. 
One of the best beers in the world? I was a bit nervous before tasting it, but it didn’t disappoint me: One of the smoothest and most balanced beers I have had, with a distinct note of Raspberry Swiss roll. 784 charactersbark, Jan 28, 2012

Bottle to Westvletren 12 (small) chalice - as it should be!
From notes. I have enjoyed this beer several times, but this review was as a result of my encounter with it as beer #4 enjoyed as part of a blind Quad tasting - to warm our palates before the real tasting - in Utrecht (December 2011). Thanks Jeffo and doopiedoopiedoo for the hospitality!
A: Burnt brown. Single (tan) fingernail head on Jeffo's pour - I was being honest.
S: Holy smokes. I knew what is was from first sniff, but gosh it doesn't get much better than this! Complex. Dark fruits, caramel, hint of vanilla, cloves, and a touch of heaven. At least I can only hope.
T: Much like the smell, but very, very smooth. Brown sugar, dark fruit, and nice balance of spice. Not overly complex, but just right!
M: Medium bodied and perfect carbonation here.
O: Stand ovation on this and it will never stopping amazing me - the monks of Westvleteren sure know how to brew an excellent beer! You can enjoy a "fresh" bottle or a vintage bottle and the result will always be the same - outstanding! It does age quite well too, but I think this bottle was a bit more fresh. Either way, it is definitely something any beer drinkers out there should have the experience of enjoying (even if you don't like the style). I converted to appreciate the Belgian Quad as a result of my first encounter with this beer. 1,384 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 27, 2012

33cl bottle best by dated 03.13.13 poured into a tulip
A: Very carbonated. Pours a deep reddish brown. A complex spider web of lacing.
S: Belgian yeast unlike others that I’ve smelled. Red grapes, raisins, and a small amount of caramel.
T: Loaded with flavor. The yeast really stands out. I’m going to pour it all in. Yum! Dark fruit and chocolate. Pretty sweet. Lots going on. The finish is pretty hot...lots of alcohol. Enough analyzing...I’m going to slow down and enjoy this.
M: The alcohol burn keeps me from rushing through this (which is good) but it hurts drinkability a bit. Carbonation was more than I expected, but I’m enjoying it.
O: So glad I got to try the great Westy 12. It’s interesting to think about everything that went into making this. I’d like to try another one with some more time on it. Hope I get another chance to try it again. Next time I'll opt for a chalice instead of a tulip. 970 charactersmjtiernan, Jan 24, 2012

A - pours a caramelly brown with a billowing head that slow dissipates to nothing
S - lots of dark fruits, figs, raisins, and brown sugar
T - starts off with caramel malt and brown sugars. These fade to a lot of dark fruits and some Belgian yeast spiciness. Come chocolaty toasted malt comes through on the finish, and leaves fruits lingering on the tongue. Really nice complexity.
M - a little spritzy with a nice body; the abv is well hidden.
D - Solid quad, really nice complexity and balance between the sweetness, fruits, and malts. Definitely worth the trouble of getting for the experience! 647 charactersbirchstick, Jan 21, 2012

A-Chestnut with a billow tan head. I am disappointed that there was no lacing or cascading.
S-Yeasty, boozy, dark fruits consisting of plums and raisins, but also some pearl and apple, with a hint of caramel. It is a complex nose.
T-Cocoa, alcohol, caramel, with some toffee and dark fruits. Surprisingly there is a slight hop bitterness which was unexpected. It was also fruitier than expected.
M-Slightly thick and somewhat chewy, balanced by a nice amount of carbonation. Honestly, it is not as thick as I expected it to be.
D-Complex, rich and satisfying-a beer I could drink for days.
Overall, I will admit I was slightly disappointed by the greatest beer in the world. That was obviously due to the extremely high expectations I had. That being said it is a great beer, but honestly I think St. Bernardus Abt. 12 is slightly better. However, I will definitely drink this again in the future. A must try for all lovers of beer. 1,066 charactersthegodfather2701, Jan 19, 2012

4.29/5  rDev -6.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 33 cl botlte into a Westvleteren chalice. There is no more recognizable unmarked bottle in all the land. Best by 09.03.12.
My pour has a dark caramel brown color with a slight ruby tint, mostly opaque but transparent in the edges. Only a small off-white cap forms on the inital pour, and this fades to a few spotty islands remain, along with a fair amount of particulate, even with a gentle pour.
The aroma is full, deep, and smooth. Brown sugar, toasted bread, caramel, raisins, figs, plums, cinnamon, Belgian yeasty spice all combine to form a nuanced and complex aroma.
Especially as it warms up, the flavor is pretty fantastic. Brown sugar blends with toasted bread, caramel, and some nutmeg, cinnamon and general yeasty spice. Raisins, plums, and dark cherries come in as the body turns from medium / full to medium / light. Right at the end, just a bit of ethyl alcohol comes in, along with some red wine vinegar acidity. The carbonation starts on the light side, and it is practically flat by the time the beer is through. It is creamy and smooth, while still a bit grainy. Medium to full body.
While there was no way for this beer to live up to the "best beer ever," I thoroughly enjoyed the anticipation leading up to my first experience, and the beer itself was quite good as well. 1,309 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jan 18, 2012

Presentation: 33 cl brown custom Trappist capped bottle. Characteristic lack of label or marking other than the cap, which shows in black, silver and gold name, seal, faintly legible date, and 10,2% Alc. by Vol. Served in a snifter.
A - Deep hazy amber brown with a towering frothy head, good retention with nice surface memory and lacing.
S - Surprising nose, a tad subdued, funky, insinuation of sourness and caramel with some mustiness…
T - …which leads to a great shift in the palate, there is a rich fruity sense woven to the yeast, prunes, figs, dash of raspberries and apples going back to some raisins, caramel touch but not that sweet at all, hint of spices in the backbone… Slightly earthy with a tart port sense at points. 
M - Medium full body with moderately tuned carbonation, nice flow with a creamy warmth as it closes.
O - Long and complex sipper. Quite a delight…
Notes: Sure, I would have it again, and again, and I did not pay tooo much for this bottle. But there is some undeniable hype riding here. Fruity and sweet character aside, this is on a similar league for me than, say, a Rochefort 10, which is readily available. Worth the try, and wishing I could ride up the monastery after having won the phone lottery to pick up a couple of legit cases. But that is another story... 1,439 charactersDaniellobo, Jan 13, 2012

4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Reviewed blindly from Blind BIF 6. Poured into Duvel tulip.
Appearance: Bottle opened to a barely audible hiss. Gentle pour into glass is yielding no head, and I can already smell the must. As I near the bottom of the bottle, I quickly stop a thick and heavy sediment from making its way into my glass. Color is a dark ruby brown, and I get nothing but a few bubbles from the nucleation point and minimal wispy lacing. This looks like a quad, and one with some age on it.
Smell: Must dominates the nose - no doubt this has some serious age on it. Underneath I get raisins and caramel. 
Taste: Sweet with a nice blend of raisins and caramel, even more fruity as it warms. The alcohol has molded into the beer nicely and makes it impossible to tell how strong it is, but something tells me this is an ass-kicker. Hint of oaky/woody flavor in here, but I don't think it's enough to say this is wood aged - more just earthy. I do get a bit of alcohol numbing on the back end, particularly as the beer warms. I will say, the one thing scaring me here is I'm not getting that Belgian yeast punch to the palate that I'd expect from a quad/strong dark. Got me worried that I'm way off here.
Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy, but goes down smooth. The carb is surprisingly strong in the mouth given the still appearance of the beer. 
Drinkability: High - I'm enjoying it immensely, but it's a sipper. 
Overall: This is right up my alley. Love the style, love the age, love the beer. Would happily drink again. Fantastic beer.

Split a bottle into a Bruery tulip.
A: Light head that cascades down as the beer is poured. An inviting creamy brown color of the body sucks you in.
S: I'll say this word a lot, but the smell is full. It occupies the nose completely with dark, complex fruits. The smell is rich enough that it is almost filling. Some warm bready notes come through as well.
T: The liquid seems to expand as it hits the tongue and the taste follows full and hard. It's a delicious, complex taste that brings memories of an earthy, warm dark setting. Maybe it's just my imagination or the power of persuasion, and I'm not sure this makes sense but I feel like this beer taste like what I imagine a monestary in Belgium to look like. Figs and dark, sweet fruits are very prominent.
M: I mentioned the mouthfeel above but it demands a second mention. I feel that the mouthfeel really puts this beer over the top. It's a light carbonation that explodes and expands as it moves through my mouth. A unique and wonderful experience.
O: I must profess that I'm not a Belgian style lover. I'm not sure if I let the hype get to me or I feel like I need to like this beer because it was expensive, but I really enjoyed this. If I was able to have access to this regularly, it would be a staple in my fridge and I'd be a Belgian beer fan for sure. Worthy of the acclaim that it gets. 1,397 charactersGatorBeer, Jan 11, 2012

4.13/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I've reviewed this beer several times but I feel inclined to give it a fresh start... 2012 vintage poured into that cheap ass Westy glass that came in the brick:
Swampy dark brown body produces a hell of a head... dense, stubborn pale khaki head that laces through and through with a decent amount of beading beneath it. Even after some time in the fridge is showcases a massive dolloped layer of carbonation that you don't really find anywhere else.
Sweet leather, caramel, overripe red fruit notes... some brown sugar aromas tie everything together. Smells much more mature than it actually is. A musty pale berry profile surfaces with a bit of warmth. 
That uniquely Westvleteren tobacco/caramel/dark fruit flavor dominates the palate from start to finish. It's one of the few beers that exhibits those classic oxidization notes even when fresh... leather, sweet and dirty dark fruits. The alcohol is more or less undetectable... I think I actually prefer this one fresh. 
Whoever says that this U.S. import version is inferior to its predecessor is high on drugs. It's the same beer, for better or worse... (well, probably worse, considering the price). 1,161 charactersyamar68, Jan 06, 2012

P: 11.2 fl oz bottle in to a snifter.
A: SRM is caramel/toffee brown. Translucent with sediment. Head is off white, 1 in, dissipates to 1 cm. Medium carbonation. Heavy lacing.
S: Semi sweet, some dark fruit, light hops, medium roast malt, blegian yeast(bread notes), alcohol.
T: Wonderfully balanced maltiness, semi sweet dark fruit, light hops, some yeastie bread notes, and some caramel notes. Aftertaste is malt and yeast/bread with a light caramel sweetness.
M: Medium/full body. Quite complex and layered. Malt and yeast give a thicker feel, but the light hops and friut lighten the feel a bit. Light alcohol gives another layer to the feel. Finished wet.
O: Easily in the top five beers I have ever had. This was the second time I have had this beer, and it was just as good as the first. I think I might like the 8 more, but not by much. Fantastic flavors, all almagamated nicely. If you are in to craft, this is the Holy Grail of craft. Consider yourself extremely honored and privileged if you get the opportunity to try this one. 1,074 characterstsauce2, Jan 06, 2012

11.2 oz bottle, date on the cap is 18.11.14 so 2011 bottling, poured into a Chimay Chalice
A- Dark brown/red with a two finger head that fades to a small light tan cap.
S- Sweet dark fruits, figs, plums, cherries, hint of spices, bananas, grapes, touch of alcohol, just complex and great.
T- Wow, a lot going on here, finish really surprised me, it is bitter from earthy spices and a hint of alcohol. Not as much dark fruits as the nose but the are here and work very well the the yeast, some grapes, some bready notes. Very well balanced, very complex and delicate.
M- Smooth, creamy, medium body.
O- Just great, and I am very happy I was able to get a bottle. I can't not wait to try this again, easily one of the best beer I have had, and very easy to drink...I almost finished the bottle before the review and that rarely happens with me. The 10.2% ABV really sneak up on you! 921 characterslarryi86, Jan 04, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured (a 2007 best before bottle so well aged) into a belgian goblet to a rich muddy looking - mid brown colour with a small head that soon vanished
Smells fruity, some dried fruit aroma, maybe some banana and certainly some spice aroma
Tastes rich and complex, burnt sugars, some spice, dark fruity flavours . . . you would not think you are drinking a 10%+ beer, the trick of any great beer, if I dind't know the ABV I'd have maybe guessed at 5 to 6 % - so basically a session beer if you're from the USA ;)
Mouthfeel was very silky and just begged for more to be imbibed
I drank the 2nd half of my glass with some roquefort cheese - an excellent pairing!
Overall a great great beer, very complex and one for a special occasion (or two!)
Having had an in-date bottle in the past, the aged one was just as good - but probably no better to be honest, slightly more earthy if that makes sense to anyone! 909 charactersRuds, Jan 02, 2012

Thank you, Brad. Best by 17th Jan 2010, so that makes this almost 5 years old.
A clear very deep ruby red with a dense, light brown head that falls off to a disk surprisingly rapidly, this looks quite excellent. The nose has plenty of plum and dark fruit jam characteristics, over-ripe even, with a little bit of cola and coffee. There are caramel and bready notes as well, and combined with the dark fruit, this smells like fruitcake. The yeasty phenols have died down with age, though a mellow spice character is present with allspice, nutmeg and clove. Pretty excellent.
The palate is dominated by the dark fruit character. So ripe and jammy, there's plums, dates, raisins, even a little bit of prunes, and a touch of black raspberry. Bready on the mid-palate with dark caramel, toffee and a little bit of cola (along the lines of Pepsi IMO). A little cocoa is present as well. While a little bit on the sweet side, this finishes quite dry and is actually refreshing. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer has a pretty stunning mouthfeel. Best beer in the world? Nope. Best quad I've had? Pretty darned close. I'm letting my original scores stand for now.

largadeer split this one with me - thanks a million for the chance to try this! Best before 19th Sept 2010
A: Very deep ruby red with dense light brown head. Excellent head retention
S: Fruity with plums, dark sugar and alcohol. Complex and sweet
T: Fruity to start with but grows in complexity with the appearance of figs on the palate. As big and full bodied as this beer starts out to be, it finishes surprisingly dry
M: Incredibly smooth with great carbonation and a sweet but dry finish
D: This is an incredibly easy-to-drink high ABV beer. I need to find more! 1,960 charactersDefenCorps, Jan 01, 2012

This is my first Westy 12, so nothing to compare to - starting w/ an 8 year old bottle.
A- Pours very deep brown and murky, got a bit of sludge toward the end of the pour, I did manage to keep most of this out of my goblet. Very thin head. 
S- Amazing. Mostly picking up plum and raisin. Definitely has a port thing going on here.
T- Very good. Dark fruits, candy sugars, a bit of a port booziness going on here. Quite warming and both strong and delicate at the same time.
M- Beautiful creamy, leaves a bit of an oily feel in my mouth, which I like.
O: Again, never had one before, but I love this. Would really like to try one w/ less age to compare. I've got a few more 8 year olds, which I'm totally fired up about after finally cracking one open.

As far as quads go it has a consistent dark malty flavor without being overbearing. It does have a very slight banana ester flavor-just a hint so may not be as noticeable. As I have found over the years drinking/trying/comparing quite a few beers especially in the quad category this one always seems to be consistently terrific but now is extremely difficult to find. 522 charactersgrasshopper, Dec 30, 2011

4.55/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks Brabander for this one, drinking this one relatively fresh. 17.8.14 on the cap. 
Was a little worried, the smell during the pour was a bit strange, but it resolved itself in the snifter. Three things hit me in the first taste: the strong solventy Belgian sweetness, alcohol and some hop bitterness. Very rich, after a big meal, this was heavy on the stomach. Very effervescent, strong carbonation. Still with all the strong flavors, it is overall a very tasty beer. As it warms the roasted malts come through. Excellent beer!
Is it better than Younger? I would say they are both excellent, but I don't see the hype. There are many beers more attainable that I enjoy at least as much, but I will say the hype and story makes each try of both an experience. 764 charactersdborginis, Dec 30, 2011

A - rootbeer with 2cm of off white head, legs for days.
S - Candi sugar, cherries, plums, whoppers, awesome.
T - A lovely malt ball covered raisin. It's delicate and and decadent and could be sipped for a long time.
M - creamy body with a slightly dry finish.
O - Screw the hype, I love this beer. I've had it, along with most of the other Belgian quads and varying ages, and this is still my favorite. I think 2-3yrs really is perfect for the beer to showcase everything. 532 charactersxpimptastikx, Dec 30, 2011

Look: Dark brown in color with a lighter shade of brown cleaning up the edges. 1/2 inch tan head and great retention
Smell: Notes of dark fruit raisin and grapes come to mind backed up by a touch of funky a yeast and just a wiff of alcohol
Taste: Just amazing fruit flavors on the palate. Raisins and figs lead the way and are just amazing. The middle carries a quite a bit of grape flavor that is a potent due to the aging. The backend has some nice spice notes from the yeast. As the beer warms up you get a bit of caramel.
Mouthfeel: Medium body and just the right amount of carbonation
Overall: I aged this one just over 3 years and celebrated the birth of my daughter with this beer and I must say this is just a Perfect Quad. 832 charactersDarthKostrizer, Dec 29, 2011

# 1- Poured into a Chimay goblet. Bottled November 2008.
Murky brown with a ton of floaties, even with a pretty careful pour. Eventually this clears/settles into something somewhat resembling a strongly roasted tea. Modestly sized head, but pretty nice retention considering the age and the width of the glass opening. Nose is freshly baked bread smeared with apple butter, straw and yeast. Not nearly as fruity smelling as I’d guessed, and not as fruity tasting, either. Yeasty and bready with a pleasant, but light plummy taste. As warms, sorghum and toffee sweetness begin to emerge, along with a light grassiness. Brown sugar. Sourwood honey. The skim of foam is easily kept alive with a swirl now and then. Scattered speckly lace isn’t too bad at all considering how much I’ve swirled this stuff to study it. Without a doubt the highlight of this bottle is the incredibly soft and velvety mouthfeel, which leaves behind a lingering yeast/bread/honey combo in the finish. 
# 2- Poured into a La Chouffe tulip. Bottled February 2009.
A shade darker, with active carbonation feeding a finger or so of beige foam. Comparatively tenacious retention. Perhaps a trick of the glassware, but the aromas are more lively with this one. The nose seems more fresh and yeasty, although not as bold as I'd like. A fruitier flavor, particularly with prune and raisin, but again, not as potent as expected. Light leafy and tobacco notes. Carbonation slightly more prickly, but in general the same seductive, slippery feel. This one seems to have a touch more warming alcohol, although neither is particularly boozy. Light cocoa and a sweetness that reminds me of straight liquid malt extract.
Overall impression: I was somewhat surprised about the differences between the batches bottled just 3 months apart, but even moreso by the subtlety of both bottles. I’d almost go so far as to call them tame, at least in the bold world of quads. Tasty, although somewhat underwhelming. Perhaps they go through something akin to the ‘awkward’ stage you often see in American barleywines. I’ll update my review if I get the chance to try fresher or older samples. 2,270 charactersPDXHops, Dec 29, 2011

A- Pours a 1 ½ finger tan head that dissipates slowly, really nice lacing, dark dark brown color, burnt orange hues coming off the bottom, really attractive beer.
S- Beautiful aroma, sweet dark fruit aroma coming out right away, Plums, raisins, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, really complex aroma. 
T- Wow, this is Incredibly smooth, brown sugar and toffee come out a lot stronger in the taste than the aroma, dark fruits come out in the background, plums, raisins just like the nose, again really smooth and easy drinking, the abv is nowhere to be seen.
M- Medium mouth feel, incredibly smooth drinking, clean finish, coats the palate, well carbonated.
O- I have had this on numerous occasions and I always forget to review it. This bottle really surprised me compared to the past bottles I’ve had, incredibly smooth, and well balanced. World class beer, very impressive. 938 charactersChriscrundwell12, Dec 26, 2011

T: Bready and Fruit. (Fig's, Raisin's , Plum's). Caramel notes linger in the back end with banana and mild bubble gum. Candied sugar is evident as well. For the strength there is no booziness what so ever. Complexity at it's best.

A: Good pop of carbonation opening the bottle. Appealing garnet color in the light. Minimal, loose, irregular head.
S: Candy, brown sugar, strawberry. Mild fusels, raisin.
T: Date, raisin, fig. Bready malts. Candied orange and cherry. Mild phenolic finish.
M: High carbonation, a bit prickly. Finishes a little too clean; carbonation is scouring too much of the flavor. After about 15 minutes, the beer seems to have gotten some of the carbonation out of it's system and it's a lot more pleasant, although the body seems a bit light and I'd like more linger.
O: Is this one of those cases of unrealistic expectations? I'm not sure. The excessive carbonation definitely takes this bottle down a notch for me, as the first half was almost impossible to taste. But beyond that, I'd say this is a nice, but not amazing beer. I'm curious to see if it's substantially different on tap when I have a chance to visit Belgium next spring. 957 characterskscaldef, Dec 26, 2011

Bought 1½ years ago directly at the abbey and stored since then in my cellar. Reviewed in direct comparison to the Rochefort 10.
The beer starts relatively bitter with hints of malt and dark fruit. Very sweet, nearly clammy, no sign of the 10,2%. 
The aroma of dark dried plums get lost in the sugary sweetness, which makes the beer very drinkable, but also very monotone. It is in my opinion even boring in comparison to the blast of aroma of the Rochefort 10. 
The aftertaste is dominated by the brown sugar and the hop-bitterness, which remind me of our German Oettinger Malz, only a bit richer. But nearly no sign of herbal flavours like the Rochefort 10. 
--&gt; If I'll be at the Belgium coast on vacation next year, I'll again buy a crate, but for me this beer is not worth any effort! Very disappointing and absolutely overrated!! 865 charactersErzengel, Dec 25, 2011

S: The beer is pretty calm. I am picking up some dark fruit, like figs or raisins. Maybe I am crazy, but I also get a bit of banana in there. 
T: Now this is where the beer deserves to be considered the greatest beer in the world. There is a nice amount of dark fruit with some malt and a good amount of sweetness. I am also getting a tiny bit of banana. Really tastes more like a 4% beer and not 10.2%. 
M: This is the perfect mouthfeel to me. It is so smooth and easy to drink. There is a tiny amount of crispness that tingles the tongue, but other than that it goes down like water. Cant ask for anything better.
O: If I could give this beer a 6 out of 5 I would. It just doesn't get much better than this and I wish it was easier to find, but I cant complain too much because I was lucky to get one thanks to my wife. Just amazing! 969 charactersgtermi, Dec 25, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received a bottle of this 'mythologic' trappist beer when a great friend (thanks, Dre!) visited the Abbey of Saint Sixtus.
Served from a chilled bottle, with the smoking gun when opened, and poured into a goblet. 
Poured a even dark brown color with 2 centimeters of tan/brown large foamy bubble head, that slowly disappeared to thin wisps but re-emerged with agitation. Beautiful micro-bubble carbonation like a Guiness commercial.
Smell is surprisingly subdued, malty and caramel tones. Smell returns with a nasal flux following sipping.
Taste is a mild blend of figgy, caramel, malt flavors. Some clove and bread in there. Hop bitterness is notably absent. Strong alcohol content is almost hidden. Aftertaste is more of the same with a smooth decay. 
Mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant, and made more robust by the lingering aftertaste.
Overall, an impressive blend of flavors and subdued notes. Like an artist's palate. High abv makes the repeated drinkability low beyond savoring a few in celebration. Awesome overall. No hype here. 1,041 charactersSkagbaron, Dec 25, 2011

Taste. Cherries, pears, brown sugar, just a little booze. Really smooth with many subtle, complex flavours.
Mouthfeel. Medium-full body with medium+, smooth carbonation.

Has the Latin phrase "Ad aedificandam abbatiam adiuvi," which means "I helped to build the abbey" on the bottle as well as a pretty dramatic "Westvleteren XII" label. Has a best before date of 31.08.14 on the cap. Poured into a Westvleteren chalice.
A- Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights, produces a thin layer of tan head, bubbles down to a ring around the edge of the glass.
S- The aroma is massive, a delicious blend of fruit (raisins, figs, dates) some phenol with licorice and caramel, spice, and moist bready malt with brown sugar.
T- Similar to the nose, with big dark fruit flavors as well as spice. Malts are big and moist, lots of caramel and bread pudding. Alcohol is warm and spicy with some clove and phenol and licorice. 
M- Medium bodied, solid carbonation with a smooth, creamy feel. 
O- An amazing beer, its reputation really is well deserved. One of the best beer's I've ever tasted. 1,103 charactersWillCarrera, Dec 22, 2011

4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Having read of this great beer for years, and coming to the understanding that it was not available, I set out a course to get some. Having been to Roquefort, and had 10, I was anxious to taste a beer that was supposed to be better than that.
Once landing in Amsterdam, it is a 3 hour drive to Westvleteren. The town is on the western edge of Belgium very near France. Having stopped at a few other breweries along the way, we arrived in Westvleteren at 4:45, and the shop closes at 5:00. A very kind person, who we asked for direction to the abbey, simply led us there, and we arrived at 4:55. We rushed into the small shop and asked for a case of 12, it was May; the Monk looked at me and said, "We will have 12 in August". Aghhh – So I bought a case of 8. 
The Monks prohibit resale of any kind, but they have built a restaurant across the dirt road from the Abbey. In there I had my first 12. As I peered at it I realized that it had the same polish in the glass as fine wine, this is unlike anything I have ever seen. The aroma is rich and layered simply lovely, but not as fine as Roquefort 10. Unlike 10, with its amorphous head, the head on 12 is relatively thin and smooth. The taste was pure heaven. Smooth, Rich, the mouthfeel was thick and glorious. The flavor is complex in nature, like other great beers, the flavor morphs as it warms up and this is an awesome thing to experience. The 13% ABV is awesome, and well hidden. The flavor lingered for a long time on the palate, allowing a glass to be savored, thank God - 
I checked a case in a roller bag - none broke – The Monks use good glass. 1,613 characterseypmcfg, Dec 21, 2011

A. Pours a pretty well carbonated 2+ finger head. Good retention. Thick lacing. Colr is dark brown with some amber hues. 
S. Very complex and rich smell. Luscious dark fruit smell, raisins, figs, and quite a bit of grape. Nice caramel malt base underneath. St. B so far for me has been the best smelling quad, I have had. I think I have to say that I give a slight edge to Westy 12. This is really a delicous smelling quad. 
T. Wow. Great dark fruit flavor just like the aroma. Raisins, figs, and quite a bit of grape. Has really all the flavor qualities that I think make the great quads. Very complex flavor. Nice caramel base, and some candi sugar sweetness. Very interested to see what time does to this beer, as in my opinion it is pretty damn good right now. 
M. Full bodied. Drinks pretty sweet but finishes fairly dry. Medium carbonation. Nice mouthfeel.
O. Having had Rochefort 10 and St. B in the last week in preparation to try the Westy 12, I am basing a lot of my review on how Westy 12 compares to those excellent beers. In all honesty I think Westy 12 is an amazing beer. For me there is quite a few similarities to St. B Abt 12. I think the Westy 12 is just a bit better overall. Very complex aroma and taste. Nice carbonated full bodied mouthfeel. Is this the best beer in the world? That is hard to say, as one of the best beers in my favorite style, I would have to say it is certainly in contention. 1,641 characterssiradmiralnelson, Dec 11, 2011

I am just starting to get into high quality craft beer, but I have already exploded my taste buds. Anyhow, here are my thoughts. 
Appearance - Dark brown, Caramel color on bottom with a lighter tone on top. 
Smell - Dark fruits, a hint of raisins.
Taste - So many different things going on. First drop that hits your mouth is a 360 spin from the last flavor that hits you. In my opinion, it starts out bitter, then quickly goes into an almost sweet aftertaste. By sweet i mean chocolatey, then a hint of raisins.
Mouthfeel - I believe mine is aged a couple years, so it is lighter. Not thin what so ever though. Just right.
Overall Westvleteren 12 impressed me more then i thought. There were so many different flavors going on that it blew me away. The best beer in the world? Maybe, maybe not. But it is a good beer that anybody should try if they have the chance. 973 charactersintensify, Dec 10, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Unfortunately this beer came at the beginning of my beer drinking career and I'm convinced has forever tainted my taste by setting the bar so damn high. It is perfect, subtle yet bold with a fruity taste that is neither to sweet nor to tart. Light with an amber/brown color, it goes down smooth and has a taste reminiscent of times only monks could capture in a beverage. A+ and R.I.P probably the only bottle i will only drink, if you see this, get it. 453 characterssespourteille, Dec 10, 2011

Pours a deep, dark mahogany. Even with a careful pour, the yeast found its way to the glass (which was fine by me). The head is moderate, slightly off-white, with only medium retention. 
Hopefully I popped the top on this a bit early, because I'm not picking up anything special in the nose. It's very malty and a bit cola-like, some dark fruits for sure, but nothing out of the ordinary. As it warms, alcohol fills the olfactories and notes of fruit cake come forward.
The taste is much better than expected based on the look and smell. It's rich, dark fruits like raisins and dates, the funky Belgian yeast is prevalent. Alcohol makes an aggressive appearance and lots of spices are prevalent. 
It's very complex. Slightly sweet with an almost strong mouthfeel to start, as it moves back it brings forth some hoppy bitterness and heat from the alcohol. It's full-bodied and the flavors and sensations are tight. A slightly dry, carbonated finish. Very warming on the lips from the high ABV. 
You'll want to error on the side of warmer rather than colder. The beer really comes alive as it warms. This beer doesn't need anything from me to pump it up, so all I can say is try it. If you're a beer geek, you owe it to yourself. I actually prefer Westy 8, but this is near the top of the list. 1,320 charactersRickS95, Dec 09, 2011

 Purchased from Etre Gourmet along with some Pannepot and A Cantillon unblended lambic. Plain brown bottle with a "Trappiste" ring around the neck.
Poured into my trusty Chimay goblet a medium brown color with a little light coming through. Medium size off-white head that fades to a covering of the glass. The covering continues throughout the tasting (about 30 minutes). Lacing consists of a film with dots of lacing contained in it.
Smell is mostly dark fruit (raisins, figs) and some Belgian yeast. Pronounced and very rich.
Taste is out of this world. Belgian candi sugar, yeast, dark fruit, spices and a little caramel malt. Expertly blended, hint of warming alcohol. Absolutely outstanding. Worthy of the hype!!!
Mouthfeel is rich and luxurious. The alcohol is not a negative factor. This is an outstanding beer. 872 charactersJayQue, Dec 09, 2011

First things first, I am coming into this beer with immense hype. How can a beer ever live up to its representation of "best beer in the world?"
A - Very dark mahogany brown color with an off-cream colored head. Head dissipates a little faster than the Blonde and 8.
S - Faint aroma of dark fruit and brown sugar. Not as aromatic as the other two either. Hmmm.

Severed in Chimay chalice it produces about 2 fingers width of white fluffy head that disappears somewhat quickly the color is a outstanding dark chestrnut brown. The smell is very faint I pick up the Belgium yeast, a boozy smell and very faint caramel sweetness. The first sip is amazing, where I was let down by the smell the taste blew me out of the water. Great caramel/molasses flavor, nice dark fruit like raisins or figs, and that great Belgium yeast flavor. The mouthfeel is prefect great balance between the carbonation and the body. Overall this was one of my favorite beers I had, the 10% alc was extremely well hidden in the taste. This is a dangerous beer if I could get my hands on it more often I would drink this all the time. 884 charactersphisigben, Dec 06, 2011

4.34/5  rDev -5.9%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5My brother visited Holland last year and was able to bring one bottle back. I’m drinking out of a brandy snifter, and letting the brew warm up some as I write this review.
Appearance is typical quad, dark, creamy, whatever.
Smell is Belgium yeast and fruity caramel malt coated in alcohol.
Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and so is the taste. While you can smell the booze, you don’t get much of it on your pallet. I taste the typical Belgium dark fruit/clove/yeast taste but I also get hints of German malts, almost like you’d find in a dopplebock or even scotch ale.
Overall, this is a very nice brew! Worth the hype? Well that depends on who you ask. I typically find Belgiums somewhat bland and overly smooth. I tend to enjoy a shock to my taste buds and a overflow of complex flavors when it comes to drinking something so legendary. 
This beer is 100% delightful to drink, totally enjoyable, yet somewhat under complex. 
I could easily drink this again and again.. Well ok no; I’ll prolly never drink it again, as its near impossible to find for most of the world, and expensive as hell.
So in a nutshell: A+ awesome brew, but not what I would call the #1 beer in the world. 1,190 charactersArknot, Dec 05, 2011

A - Great dark brown body that allows a bit of light to pass through. There is a little bit of sediment that settled at the bottom of the glass. Fantastic off white/light khaki head that sticks around forever. Really creamy and tight bubbling with some moderate lacing and retention. 
S - Loads of dark candied/caramelized fruits. Figs, prunes, plums, raisins etc. This is followed by a great spice note and some light yeast and alcohol. Extremely well balanced.
T - Follows the nose. Candied dark fruits, caramel, and then the spices. The aftertaste is of Belgian yeast. The flavor is so well balanced and delicious. I could down pint after pint of this stuff. The alcohol is not noticeable at all.
M - Creamy, medium mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation. It coats your mouth but doesn't stick around for too long. Fantastic.
O - I actually wanted to not like this beer as much as I did. I know it has a great deal of hype and I figured since I invested $0 on the bottle I would be going into it unbiased. It blew me away though. This is an excellent quadrupel and its worthy of its high ranking. I enjoyed it much more than the easier to find examples, and the only other quad that I have had that surpassed this was pannepot grand reserva. 1,455 charactersdavey101, Dec 02, 2011

Produces a fizzy tan head that falls down to a nice little thing of almost a finger. The body is brown with red/orange hues popping up at the bottom of the glass when held up to the light. The head sticks around and leaves a nice sheet down the glass. 
Pleasant alcohol aroma is present along with a little sweet caramel. Dark bread, dark fruits, and cherry round it out.
Oh my, this thing is smooth as a babies bottom. The alcohol and carbonation leave a little tingle on your tongue. Medium bodied. Dry. Some dark fruity raisin thing going on. Leaves a bready taste in my mouth. A little sweet, but not overbearing like some quads can be.
As close to perfection regarding quads as far as I’ve had. I suggest eating beforehand or pairing with something after you get a taste for it because this leaves the head feeling good afterwards if you aren't prepared. 898 charactersMattSweatshirt, Nov 30, 2011

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So I have had this special brew on several occasions but never done a proper review. This beer is so well worth all the hype. Thie style used to hold many of the top spots in BA's top spots but have slipped a bit in recent years. Much of the slide of this brew can be attributed to the release of the castle box that made it to the U.S.  Big IPA's and barrel aged stouts be damned, this beer is the pinnacle of perfection for the style. So much balance and complexity that is almost to much for a novice palate to appritiate.  This may be a reason for the slip in ratings. Spicy and layered wonderful sweetness in terms of flavor. Let this warm to closer to room temperature before you enjoy. 692 charactersSPLITGRIN, Nov 29, 2011

An over-foamer. I was being gentle with the cap to save it, and ended up loosing at least an oz. or two. Bummer. Dark cola brown with a light tan head, decent foam and nice sheets of foamy lace. It had a little spritziness to it that I found concerning, but it didn't decimate the head retention as I expected. 
Smell is phenolic, not as sweet as the taste, fruit and spice, macerated berries. 
Taste is good, this one is complex, on the sweet side, some big grape flavors, caramel, but it's not to sugary. Just awesome. 
Mouthfeel is lighter, some crispness to it, just a touch sticky. 
Drinkability is pretty good. I've had this a few times, but this is the first full bottle I've savored on my own. Obviously, it's hard to get a hold of, so that hurts it, but overall, it's a great beer. A top candidate for a desert island beer. 984 charactersccrida, Nov 26, 2011

Date on Cap: 15.12.13
Pours a dark chestnut brown with a craggy, foamy off white head that leaves thick lacing. Breaks down to about a half inch thick foam.
The aroma is of tart fruit, with some dark sugars and phenols. Very faint alcohol.
The taste is again of more tart fruits upfront, followed by light yeast and dark sugar notes and finishes in a very light, boozy warming. Very low phenol character intermittently, which I enjoy as I find the spice in some quads to be a bit much for my taste.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with prickly, active carbonation.
A very enjoyable beer, and I love the balance in tart/dark fruits and the phenol spice. I feel very fortunate to get to try this beer.
All of that said, it is not such a spectacular beer that I would probably not go the great lengths it generally takes to acquire this beer. 876 charactersvkv822, Nov 22, 2011

Looks-wise, slightly disappointing. The trappists are known for their big, voluptuous heads and this one is a little sad, a sandy beige with limited retention and no lacing. But otherwise, it looks good, cloudy cola brown with cinnamon orange highlights. The aroma is a deep, dark vault of nuance. Brown sugar, raisins, pure caramel malt, pumpernickel, and toffee come first; delve a little deeper and you get toast, coconut, praline, and calvados. Despite its darkness there is a champagne-like quality to it, a mix of biscuit and fruit (mostly apples, grapes, and figs).
The flavor is lovely and round, full of cherries, dates, rum, and brandy. Toasted marshmallow and bourbon come through as well, with a touch of oak and hints of anise. It is delicious, filling, lingering, and soft, chewy and rich but still vaporous and dry. A beer of many contradictions and beautiful harmonies.
Outstanding. 917 characterssoulgrowl, Nov 21, 2011

Poured into goblet after returning home from hospital after the birth of my son!
Aroma: A nice, sweet apple note, freshly-baked whole grain bread, clove, and yeast.
Appearance: Very light tan, 2 fingered head hangs around for a while, and leaves sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Body is a very hazy dark amber/brown.
Flavor: Sweet caramel, subtle clove, and some underlying alcohol. Sip after sip, the alcohol seems to come through more and more, and lends to a bitter finish. Up front, the brew tastes fantastic. It could probably use some age, though, to soften the boozy bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Very well-carbonated. Body is medium-full. The high amount of alcohol leaves a nice warming feeling in the throat after swallowing.
Overall: Definitely a fantastic, well-balanced quad. Is it the best beer, or even Belgian quad I've ever had? Unfortunately not. I'd really like to get another bottle of this and let it age for a couple of years to see how it improves. This many people can't be wrong! 1,074 charactersmdvatab, Nov 19, 2011

A: Murky chestnut body with an impressive cap of tan foam that sticks around nicely. Great head for being sold old.
S: Intense, rich, deep, and smooth. Toffee, dates, prunes, and straight maltiness. Very, very, very nice. Perhaps not as noticeably complex as a fresh bottle, but the smoothness more than makes up for that. Terrific.
T: Super smooth, with terrific balance between sweet malts and more restrained dark fruits. Slight alcohol tingle on the finish, and a touch of mustiness that is the only negative sign of senescence.
M: Smooth (again), delicately carbonated, and perfectly graceful.
O: No surprises here, this beer ages like a champ. I'll be updating this review with that of a fresher bottle shortly; I've tried this beer several times now at tastings, and I can't wait to savor an entire bottle all by myself.

Bottle dated 07.01.14
Pours a nice black-purple with a very healthy good-looking white head. Nice cloudy lacing.
Smell is lots of yeast and some alcohol. Very very pleasant fresh yeast smell though, almost porridge-like. Some celery. Raisins and grapes.
Taste is also very yeasty with a really nice grapey sweetness which is well balanced with alcohol bitterness. Aftertaste is very alcoholic. Normally I find quads a bit sweet but this one has a really potent and enjoyable bitterness and bite to it.
On the mouthfeel, feels like the beer is laced with oatmeal- thick, creamy and awesome.
Is this beer overrated? I would say yes. It is still excellent however. For something represented as being all things to all people, it holds up well. Can't wait to try the -BA version! 945 charactersdanieelol, Nov 17, 2011

Poured a golden brown, medium head minimal lacing ... and a terrific aroma of candied sugars, figs and raisins. Excellent body with medium sweetness, hints of vanilla, dark fruits and some caramel. excellent carbonation and a solid finish. I think what sets this one apart form others it the incredible balance between the carbonation, flavors and alcohol. Hard to live up to the hype of being the highest ranked beer in the world - but definitely something everyone must try if you have the chance. It is worth it!

Poured from the bottle into my Russian River Belgian glass. Huge thanks to Erik for the hookup! Date on the bottle cap is 24.09.13.
A - Pours an impossibly opaque reddish brown, with a finger's worth of cream colored head. Never seen a beer quite this color. When held up to the light, shows a tannish outer edge. The way that this beer starts at the darkest of browns in the center and just sort of works its way out to the edges and a lighter brown/tan is astounding. Head retention is great as well, lasting for a full 20 minutes after the pour.
S - Ripe red apples. Just a dash of tartness. I want this smell in my nose forever. As I delve further into the glass, picking up some caramel notes, some molasses perhaps. I have definitely never smelled a beer quite like this.
T - Starts off following well from the nose, especially as I swirl it around my mouth. Tastes of red apples, with some caramel and molasses in the background. Honestly reminds me of a warm apples cider type of taste. There is an odd dry finish to this beer that leaves an interesting aftertaste in my mouth. Fairly alcoholic in the finish, which is my one beef with this beer. I also don't really get the tartness that I picked up in the nose, which was a bit disappointing.
M - Starts off with a great feel, with no burn at all and absolutely fantastic on the tongue. However, the finish provides a bit of a harsh burn, which is accompanied by a drying sensation that doesn't quite work for me. 
O - Overall, a great beer. A phenomenal beer. But not the perfect beer. If the mouth was matched perfectly to the nose, this may have been my first perfect 5, but alas, it was not to be. 1,679 charactersMarkIntihar, Nov 15, 2011

A cloudy, slightly chunky dark brown colour which is quite pale at the edges. Small, light tan head with decent head retention.
Sherried malt and raisins. Dried dates. Light Christmas spices. Malt and toffee. Rich and complex.
The flavour maintains a balance between lightness and richness. It is sweet and sherried without being cloying. Light hard fruits. Touches of raisin. Not bad at all.
Medium body with moderately-high carbonation. Eminently digestible.
A delicious and complex Trappist ale. It is truly excellent though I'm not sure I buy into the myth that it is the best of the Trappists. 679 charactersdgilks, Nov 14, 2011

A – Poured out a brown with reddish hues. Luxurious looking creamy one finger tan head. Sticky lacing. 
S – Classic Belgian aroma to start. Yeast. Lots of floral qualities. Spiciness. Rum. Dark fruit. 
T - Nice dark fruit to start off with plums and raisins included. A nice grape flavor comes along. Some caramel and brown sugar lend some sweetness. Towards the finish you get a spicy, peppery quality along with just a touch of warming effect from the alcohol.
M – Medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Incredibly smooth drinker. This beer just coats your palate with flavors. 
O – Incredibly tasty brew. More complexity then my palate can even fathom. Taste is out of this world. Lived up to the hype for me. Always on the prowl for more. 902 charactersGallowsThief, Nov 12, 2011

The smell is of yeasty fresh bread and a slight booziness too. The taste is bitter on the front end but that leaves quick and your mouth is filled with a fruity sweetness that coats your whole mouth. The sweetness stays but you still get that bitterness. It is well balanced and not boozy at all like the smell leads. I can see why this one is rated so high. while I do agree with it having a high rating I have to admit I'd take a russian imp stout over this any day. Still a great beer and I'm glad I got to try it!!! thanks Wyatt!!! 686 charactersbobbypaulson, Nov 10, 2011

O: Amazingly balanced and complex. Far too smooth for how much alcohol is in there. Without a doubt, a fantastic beer that just about lives up to its hype. 602 characterssirosler, Nov 07, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured a bottle of this into a Duvel tulip glass.
Had a dark brown color with a half-inch head on an easy pour. Compared the beer to a St. Bernardus Abt 12. Westy had a slightly darker brown color.
Smell was amazingly complex. This is probably where the beer shone the most. St. Bernardus had almost no smell compared to the Westy. The smell was of toasted malts, some mixed yellow and dark raisins. Some spices, almost had the smell of red wine and some sour beer.
Taste was not sour. This is one smooth beer. Raisins and spices shine through. Excellent malt sweet taste. Yeast is present but not overpowering. Warming but subdued alcohol presence. St. Bernardus was way more boozy than the Westy. 
Carbonation was also silkier in Westvleteren. St. Bernardus had more carbonation and felt a little invasive, like it detracted from the beer. 
An excellent beer overall. Very, very drinkable. This is definitely the easiest drinking 10.00 ABV beer I've ever had. I could have this beer every day. It is complex and well rounded.
St. Bernardus is also a great beer, but really, I do believe Westvleteren is in another class. 1,128 charactersluisfrancisco, Nov 07, 2011

Smells of figs and raisins soaked in alcohol. Sweet yeasty smells like a cinnamon bun with extra fruit.
This a 4 year old beer and it holds up nicely. Sweet fruit up front with some sugary spice in the middle and ends with Just the right touch of heat. Complex and tasty.
Mouthfeels is medium and nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either.
A really nice beer inline with or slightly better than Rochefort or St Bernadus. The monks do it right. 546 charactersYnot2, Nov 05, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I only got to try about 1/4 of a bottle of this exceptional beer but it has definitely lived up to it's reputation. Amazingly enough a bartender at a bar me and a friend frequently attend and joined a beer club at got a bottle from a friend who had been to Belgium recently. He was kind enough to share it with us and give us a each about a quarter of the bottle. I would definitely like to try this again but I savored each mouth-full of the little I tried.
A: Dark brown and somewhat opaque. Small head but difficult to judge what the head would be like on a full pour from the small amount sampled.
S: Fruity, malty, and sweet notes rose out of the glass with each smell. Even after the initial smell and taste complex and intense scents still shined through.
T: Amazingly complex. Fruity, sweet, and malty with yeast flavors coming through. Apparently the bottle we tried was extremely fresh and strong flavors really pushed through and popped. Flavors of this beer lingered long after it was finished and I hoped they would have lingered even longer.
M: Fairly high carbonation but still very smooth. Each sip was savored and taken very slow in order to get as much as I could out of the small sample and the texture was perfect for a quad.
O: Overall I would say this may have been one of the best beers I have ever tasted. I wish I could have had a full bottle of it but from what I had it was outstanding. I feel as though there is much more to experience from this beer because it is just so complex. If I ever get the opportunity I will definitely try this again and hopefully unlock more of the complex secrets this beer offers. 1,644 charactersssznyter, Nov 04, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewing from notes.
I've finally found a bottle of this holiest of holies locally and for a very reasonable price. I have wanted to try this one since the very first time I saw it atop the Beer Advocate Top Beers. I asked the bar tender if he'd let me open it myself and he kindly obliged.
Appearance: Poured into a chalice. Dark brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light. Very little head, a few floaties. The head retention is minimal.
Smell: Full and complex, red wine grapes, rum soaked raisins, candied fruit, molasses, some yeasty bread-like aromas, dark caramels, some spices, black pepper, little bit of alcohol. Wow. Just wow.
Taste: Big vinous flavour, some alcohol warmth, caramel. Spices, some chocolate, big malty backbone, esters, dark fruits, clove. 
Mouthfeel: Thick and effervescent. Pleasantly coats the tongue.
Overall: Best beer in the world? Damn good chance of it. This beer was well worth the wait and easily one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely top 2 or 3. I don't know when I will get the chance to have this one again, but I certainly hope it's soon. 1,106 charactersdragonofblood, Nov 03, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 411.2oz dated 06.10.13 on the cap. Got this for free in an order from Beer Planet. Poured into a New Belgium globe.
Roasty chestnut in color, almost ruby with an off white brownish head that sticks around. Lacing as the beer is drank down. 
Spice and bready yeasty qualities prevail through the nose at first with highlights of nutmeg and dessert bread. Much more spice than what I experienced in a Rochefort 10. Subtle highlights of raisin and figs but not as much as I would have liked. Alcohol is present throughout the smell and can become a little overbearing, in my opinion. Almost smells like rubbing alcohol at points.
Fig and raisin more apparent in the taste of this, which I let a sigh of relief from. Candy sugars and Belgian spice, with some yeast qualities which are more subtle in the flavor. Spice is similar to holiday spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, clove and allspice. The yeast gives a good dessert bread quality to the beer and only accentuates the spice, fruit, and candy flavors. Alcohol much less apparent than the smell. A touch of chocolate too.
Smooth, delicate, and medium body. Almost silky in it's texture, with low carbonation. Might be one of this beer's strongest characteristics behind the flavor.
A nice balanced tasting quad with flavors of dark fruits, spice, with dessert and candy qualities. The nose was a bit strong on the alcohol but for this alcohol by volume, I feel that is forgivable. I've never been overly impressed with this one like everyone else is, but it certainly is a great beer. I believe the scores more have to do with the elusive character the beer maintains, due to it's limited availability and the monks choice to not commercialize their beer. 1,707 charactersauroracrisis, Nov 02, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52 year old bottle poured into a snifter. 
It pours a nice cloudy dark brown with a small sized head. Smells great (and complex). I sensed some dark fruits, and a hint of caramel and sugar.
The taste is exceptionally complex. Each sip was different. It tasted of yeast, candied sugar, and dark fruits (think figs and raisins). Although the alcohol was hidden well in some sips, it was not hidden at all in others. The mouthfeel was pleasant and smooth, though a tad thinner than I excpected.
Overall, this is a fantastic brew, although overrated. It is on the same level as St. Bernardus and Rochefort, and I would actually prefer St. Bernardus. 647 charactersDunkle, Nov 02, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5For a quad, the appearance of this was a bit light. Previously i had the rochefort 10 and was used to a VERY dark trappist quad
I rented a car in Paris France so i could drive up to Belgium for the sole purpose of getting this beer. Luckily my wife(we were on our honeymoon) was quite happy to join me on this excursion. I can say that with the build up of the then top beer advocate rating i was not even slightly disappointed once i was able to taste this exceptional beer.
This put every trappist that is available in the states to shame. I did a side by side comparison when i got home and the old favorites paled up against the Westy. 641 charactersstormywaters, Oct 28, 2011

Thanks to london1o1 for this opportunity.
It pours a dark brown body that in the light seems more of a ruby brown color. Lots of dark yeast floating around and a thinly laced head right from the start. Not much head at all. 
Lots going on in the aroma department. Dark fruits like raisens, figs are right up front along with some sweet caramel, lemon peel and a nice spicy kick. There is a little heat as well.
Taste held up incredibly over the years on this one. Sweet malts and belgium spices are right up front. Brown sugar, lemon peel, honey, caramel and dark fruits linger around in the back. A little bit of heat on this one but not over the top, just enough. Man this beer is delicious. 
Mouthfeel is almost velvet like. Carbonation held up good, very smooth and goes down pretty easy. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting.
Overall this is an amazing beer. I've yet to have it fresh but I cant imagine it tasting any better than this bottle does right now. This is a beer I will always be seeking out. 1,047 charactersStockfan42, Oct 26, 2011

Rich malt taste, light bitterness. Definite suggestions of sugar, raisins and a very light spice profile. Light alcohol burn. Rich, but not heavy and a light, but effervescent body. Up there with Rochefort 10, but a bit rarer and a bit more expensive. An ideal quad, but not one I'd buy often if only because of the price. 421 charactersBDTyre, Oct 26, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -6.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The appearance of this beer is awesome. Beautiful color (warm medium/golden brown) with a nice thick head. The lacing is marvelous...probably one of my favorite aspects of this beer. Aroma definitely offers a strong dark fruit character...there is a sweetness as well, along with a touch of Belgian yeast.
Taste is strong in raisins/dark fruits. Belgian yeast is present throughout. A touch of malty flavor is there as well, mostly as the brew warms. Very drinkable, especially for a quad. Nice mouthfeel...carbonation is good, and overall this beer is pretty smooth.
Did it live up to the hype? Honestly, my favorite quad is still Rochefort 10. I'm actually relieved because this beer certainly isn't an easy one to get! I'm happy that I had the opportunity to try it, and I recommend that if you can try it...keep an open mind. Maybe it will be the best thing you ever had, but I really feel a lot of the strong ratings come from the rarity/hype around this gem. Still an AMAZING beer...no doubt about that...and it is world class. Just not my personal favorite quad! 1,071 charactersMsRif, Oct 25, 2011

As i walked into In Dre verde my whole body was shaking with anticipation and i must say the 12 didn't let down. It was poured into the Westvleteren glass and it looked so elegant. It had a perfect one and half inch head right up to the lip. And from the first sip i could tell what an amazing beer it was. Just like the other Westys it has a full and I mean FULL body and right away you can taste 4 or 5 different flavors coming through. What most impressed me was the smoothness. From start to finish it was incredibly consistent. After all of my hyping my father and friend were also very impressed and could see why we made the trip. Can't wait to try another bottle of this when i get home 935 characterstenaciousp65, Oct 23, 2011

A: Very dark brown, cola-like. Some head with the pour, with a very thin layer retained the entire time
S: Notes of belgian spice and lots of dark fruit (raisin, fig, plum). Spiced bread provides balance
T: Dark fruit is prominent, with the belgian yeast providing complexity. Caramel and fresh bread. All the flavors are blended wonderfully. Mix of bitterness from the spices and small amount of heat from the alcohol
M: Medium bodied. Slightly sweet and bitter/spice flavor lingers
D: No doubt a world class beer. Very complex and hides the alcohol well. Very excited to have another two to age a few years 718 charactersBrez07, Oct 23, 2011

Lucky to have traded twice for one. Pours a super syrupy brown with nearly zero head on a careful pour. Smells very bready along with nuts and dark fruit. The taste is delicate brown sugar malt with several layers of sweetness. I pickup lots of belgian dark sugar and it reminds me a bit of a well aged barleywine, but not as thick or heavy. The mouthfeel is slick and a tad syrupy with a nice medium carbonation. Mild alchohol finish on it, but I loved it. 562 charactershombrepalo, Oct 18, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Served at 55 degrees F, it pours a thick and carbonated, off-white head. The color of the beer is medium brown and somewhere between translucent and opaque.
Aroma: Up front there is a ton of dark fruit character: raisins, cherries, and figs with cherries being the most aggressive. There is also some caramel and toffee flavors, and a touch of yeast and alcohol. As it warms some more of the yeasty character comes to the fore, along with a sweetness that wasn't there in the beginning.
Taste: There is a surprising lack of alcohol in this beer. What alcohol I did detect was well-hidden and not present until I was nearly done with the entire glass. The dark fruits mentioned in the aroma are all there, but there is also a bit of roastiness, similar to toasted oatmeal. The caramel and toffee flavors are there at the beginning, but as it warms they subside into more of an overall malt character. A touch of bitterness at the end is all that lets me know there were indeed hops added at some point in the brew day.
Mouthfeel: Creamy with medium carbonation. The taste of the sweetness lingers, but not in an unpleasant or cloying way.
Overall: Such a fantastic, fantastic beer, and well worth the wait I enforced upon myself. And it lives up to the hype! It's unbelievable to me that there are Belgians out there that have the opportunity to drink this beer on a semi-regular basis. I will seek this beer out again sometime, and encourage all beer lovers to try it at some point in their lives. 1,513 characterstedsox31, Oct 16, 2011

HUGE thanks to a regular trading partner Daniloknezic!
Date on cap reads: 23.03.14
poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: light brown bodied beer with cranberry hue noted when held up to light. 1 finger of tan colored head that fades down into a thin cap on top of the beer.
Smell: Very fruity smelling quad; apples, pears, and dark fruits abound. A mild spicy smell is noted in the nose as well.
Taste: Caramel and brown sugar malty sweet goodness. Also very fruity just like the nose. Dark fruits are prominent. Hints of pears, red delicious apples and white grapes. Malty sweet and fruity. Its delicous.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with lively moderate carbonation. This beer is soo rediculously smooth and yet it has a syrupy feel to it is well. Not boozey at all. As the beer warms it becomes a little dry. Fantastic mouthfeel. 
Overall: Yes I agree. This beer is living up to the hype for me. I really enjoy this beer and I want to get my hands on more! Seek it out and enjoy it. Every beer geek needs to try this once in thier life! Willing to visit the brewery for a beer that is without a doubt World Class beer! 1,159 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Oct 15, 2011
4.61/5  rDev 0%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finaly got round to opening a bottle of this stuff (had 5 bottles for a number of years), lets see what all the fuss is about.
Poured into a Westvleteren chalice, it looked fairly limp compared to it's 8% brother, wispy head on top of a moody looking dark browny/red body. I tried not to let any sediment out the bottle, but a little managed to leap past me into the chalice, I'll drink the remainder of the bottle (a fifth) with most of the sediment at the end of the review. I am reviewing live as I drink this evening.
The nose is rich red fruits, dried on a bed of dark chocolate and aged with fine English Oak, this is a smell not to mess with.
The taste is fantastic, add some carbonisation and a heap of alcohol to the aforementioned aromas and you're half way there: I found a gargantuan amount of flavours and I now see why beery people clamour for this brew so much. Sweeter than I thought it would be (shared half a glass at the brewery bar when I bought the beer, don't remember the sweetness), but that doesn't detract from the tasting I'm currently having, which I'm really enjoying.
The 10.2% only become evident as the mouth dries, so well is the body and mouthfeel, a truely great beer, certainly now in my top 10, only the appearance letting it down. 1,272 charactersBlackHaddock, Oct 13, 2011

 poor head retention with minimal lacing, not what i expected. i do believe the glass may be the issue here.
soft malty nose with raisins and stewed plums coming to the front with notes of rich barley and caramel at the finish. 
sweet on the palate with rich flavours of malt and stewed fruits with hints of caramel on the back end. the sweetness works well with the 10.2 ABV but is a little cloying with the sweetness. only a little!
mouthfeel is fantastic, thick on the tongue and the faintest ethanolic presence which cuts through the high sugar content to leave you wanting more. very long finish, god its good. 
overall a fantastic beer. however the excess sugar and added caramel make the beer a little cloying, nothing compared to some other beers but still, for the worlds most acclaimed beer i find the balance could be more centered. having drunk a lot of belgian trappists on tap in belgium, i am fairly certain that if this was on draught these problems wouldn't exist. a travesty that the westy cafe was closed for the hop harvest festival when i was there.
to conclude, this beer needs to be drunk on draught to fully enjoy it, i got a fresh bottle but even so i just know it would have been out of this world if it was from a freshly tapped keg. next time i will report on and aged bottle, just give me a few years! the best trappist ive ever drunk and hopefully not the last time i drink it.
EDIT* reading back over the reviews. i believe this beer has been subject to the tried and true over-hype phenomenon. someone says its 'the shit', and people taste it, even if it isnt there. covet this beer but dont ASSUME its the be all and end all. 1,815 charactersBeerWanker, Oct 11, 2011

Appearance: Pours out a reddish mahogany color, with 2" of light khaki head. Retention is incredible on this beer, and the lacing is awesome as well. 
Smell: Some dark fruits present, with figs and dates. Probably not as dark fruit heavy as I was expecting though. Phenols as well, some yeastiness, and a sweet grapey twang oddly enough.
Taste: Caramel malts and a bit of toffee up front, followed by figs, dates, yeast, and again that sweet grape flavor. Phenols and spices round out the back end. Finish is sweet with a grape juice twang and phenols. 
Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is just under medium with high, very fine carbonation. Pillowy mouthfeel. This beer was certainly good as I had expected, but I wasn't awed by it. A little sweeter than I was expecting which retracted for me. 900 characterszhanson88, Oct 10, 2011

Aroma is dark fruits, figs, dates, brown sugar, spice, rum, and a hint of molasses. Smells exquisite.
Taste is rich and complex. Sweet dark caramel malt, spice, booze, figs, and raisins. Super smooth, chewy mouthfeel. Fills every taste bud with a complex blend of flavors.
This beer totally lives up to the hype. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the head - but this beer is also 4+ years old, which may account for that. If I try another one I'll make sure to get it fresh.
(Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.) 867 charactersdraheim, Oct 07, 2011

T: My word this is good. The flavor of the dark fruits is nothing short of spectacular. Robust, bold, big flavors. Malts, booze, fruits, all balanced together absolutely perfectly.

4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I shared a few bottles with a handful of friends, poured into a Rochefort goblet. 
It's a cloudy brown color very similar to the 8, with a finger or so of off-white head. 
The aroma is heavenly, a blend of toffee, dark fruits, rich caramel, spices, a little floral hops, and just a slight tinge of alcohol. It's inviting, warm, and top notch.
The taste is more of the same, rich with flavors, each bursting through but none overpowering. It's like everything you would want in a good quad is there, toffee, dark fruit, floral hops, esters, a slight yeast funk, brewing spices... it's all there but nothing in so much quantity that it takes away from the rest.
A pure joy to drink, there's a reason this beer is considered by many to be the #1 beer in the world. I was worried it wouldn't live up to all the hype, but it absolutely did, and everyone else tasting it felt the same way. 887 characterstheboozecruise, Oct 05, 2011

S: Aromas of toffee, ripe plums, port, raisins, and table grapes fill the nose. As the beer settles, notes mellow alcohol and brandy become detectable. Very nice.
T: A malty, rich entry dissolves into harmonious notes of milk chocolate, toffee, plums, raisins, figs, dates, cognac, and port. The finish is delicate, mellow, and exceptionally long with restrained notes of dark fruit and warming alcohol giving way to a pipe tobacco and earthy hop fade. Exceptional. I've never had a beer with a better flavor profile.
M: Full-bodied and substantial in the mouth. Starts off silky and smooth, but dries out nicely on the finish. Very satisfying and perfectly balanced for such a strong ale.

4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Cloudy, mahogany body. Thick off-white head (about two fingers) that leaves behind some heavy lacing.
S: Sweet mixed with a fair amount of dark fruit (plum, fig, raisins). Yeast is also evident with a hint of alcohol.
T: Belgian candied sugary sweetness which is offset by a peppery spiciness. Dark fruits are also involved. Only a hint of alcohol warming.
M: Full-bodied but not heavy. Creamy and smooth, while light in carbonation with a touch of dryness.
O: One of the best Quads I have ever had. I can definitely see why it's ranked #1. 547 charactersPatrickSullivan, Sep 30, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have had it from the bottle (in a glass of course) twice now. Thank god I was sitting down both times.
Truly is the only beer I have ever said that with and that's all that needs to be said. It tastes and smells wonderful. Malty, dark fruit, and earthy. The absolute best beer. I keep thinking others may overtake it from my favorites... like I said, it is still the only beer I have ever had that made my knees quiver.

4.66/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy chestnut brown with little light coming through it and showing some red at the top and bottom, with tons of bubbles racing up the beer; it looks like a thick porter or brown ale with a lot of sediment in it. This had the most amazing creamy tan head that poured 3 fingers thick and lasted about 5 minutes, literally. It was marvelous to look at as it faded extremely slowly, leaving good spotty lacing. A very impressive looking beer overall that was a sight to see. 
Smells of caramel, syrup, sweet malt, yeast, brown sugar, pepper and light spices, herbs and faint molasses. The alcohol aroma was very mild and not a distraction, making for a nice sweet malty nose. 
Tastes of caramel, syrup, sweet malt, yeast, brown sugar, pepper, light spices, mild floral hops, herbs, tea leaf, faint molasses, a sweet alcohol presence like rum or a port wine, and some dark fruit; this tastes like it was barrel aged and the fermentation leaves an overall sweet flavor that is complex and very tasty. 
Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy, with basically no carbonation, a medium body that's chewy, and a buttery feel as it slides across the tongue that left a semi-dry finish. 
This beer was a pleasure to drink and felt great as it went down. Very high drinkability, this was an outstanding beer that I am happy to have tried as it's not readily available in the US and I was lucky enough to try some brought back straight from Belgium. It went down so smooth and easy, hid the ABV with perfection so it wasn’t even a factor, and this beer was just impressive in every facet of this drinking experience. This beer lived up to the hype and is a very high recommendation. 1,687 charactersCHickman, Sep 25, 2011

Rich aroma of figs, chocolate, bread (breads really), raisins, currants. 
Taste is as complex and dark as you'd expect from a quad and matches the aroma. It's drier and less sweet than some quads. Very creamy and thick. It finishes clean and dry. Every sip is a little different--one of the great qualities of the most complicated beers.

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had the opportunity to visit l'abbey of Saint Sixtus and their cafe, de Vrede, late in October 2010 with a beer tour group. We tasted all three beers. I waited a few months to review this and add comments just to see if time and more tasting would alter my opinion. It has not. 
Everyone in our group had read and heard all the hype for years and quite frankly many in the group, including myself, were doubtful that any beer could live up it to such a reputation. For the record, although the beer by the six-pack is sometimes available for purchase and carryout at the cafe, it was not on the day of our visit. In reality, unless you live in the area or are visiting for a long time, you will probably never be able to buy any of the beer in great quantity. Check our their website to review their order and purchase system. If you are lucky enough and living right, their system allows you to purchase a couple of cases (sometimes more) through their reservation system. We did see an OCCASIONAL bottle for sale in beer stores such as Bier Temple in Brugge and Brussels. 
When I see Westvleteren for sale in the U.S. and it has a label on it or a different cap, etc. I wonder who did that? Certainly not the monks. I wonder if it is even the same beer. The individual bottles I saw around Belgium retailed for 14 Euro (close to $20 per bottle). 
Now, on to the tasting! 
We ordered all three and if memory serves me right, we paid about 3.5 Euro per beer. The beers arrived in bottles and the staff opened and poured each at the table (they weren't going to allow any unopened bottles to leave the premises). Poured into Westvleteren chalices. Naturally, we started with the 6, then the 8 and finally the 12. The 6 and 8 were great beer in their own right but we had come for the 12! Quite frankly we had been tasting beer for two weeks all over Belgium and the Netherlands and had some very fine beers, some well known and others from small artisan local breweries. I love Belgian ales and I doubted that any beer could top my favorites. I was looking and hoping to find fault. I did not. The 12 was pure perfection. 
I won't spend my time rehashing what most reviewers have already covered. You already know the color, feel, etc. I will say the smell is heavenly and unlike any I had ever experienced. I wondered if the taste would match. It did. I will concur with those that were amazed at the complexity of the taste (earthy, dark fruits, sweet, etc. ) and how well masked the alcohol was. This beer slowly crept up on us and just covered us. This will be the taste against which I will always measure similar styles of beer. I will be chasing the memory of that taste and the rest of my beer drinking days. It was just different and a notch above everything else. We may have been drunk as we walked out of the cafe, but we all agreed that . . . yes . . . there is a God and he has his hand in this endeavor! 
I have had a couple of 12s since that day, both had been aged for a couple of years. Great, but not the same. Perhaps the travel and heat altered it. Fresh is what I will always remember. The monks advocate drinking it fresh and from my experience . . . I have to agree. 3,196 characterslwhcchh, Sep 19, 2011

Quads aren't my personal favorite style, but for a Quad this is definitely the best in my opinion. Very flavorful, with a nice level of sweetness and an interesting level of hops. Alcohol felt well masked. It poured a dark brown with perfect head left on top. Wish this was more readily available, but if I get the chance, I will definitely purchase again. Lives up to the hype. 457 charactersEA728, Sep 18, 2011

4.09/5  rDev -11.3%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Jeffo much kindly for the Westvleteren trade. A fresh one here, bottle cap dated 22.09.13. Poured into an official Westvleteren chalice. Smoke and big gas pop upon opening. 
A great appearance consisting of a creamy off tan/white head that has peaks and valleys. Whipped up meringue like topping. Body is a nice dark ruby red and some chestnut/walnut dark brown with a see through quality but dark to actually see through. Lacing while drinking is exceptional consisting of scatters waves of foam while drinking. Once again like their blonde, an amazing appearance.
Nose though is almost non existent. Closed and muted a subtle hint of alcohol heat over top a juicy grape. Nose opens up after a couple of sips more so slightly. Hints of grainy ripping husk sense too after opening, perhaps some raisin/dates sense.
Taste though, is an example I think of why lots of people cellar this beer. A very noticeable and overpowering hot alcohol heat that sits on top of a juicy grape palate. Alcohol masks much of the malt and fruit component but does bring interesting play. Much of the boozy feels like a junipery gin with classic botanicals and so forth. Texture is solid even creamy to some extent giving that juicy feeling. There is a tannic quality to this like the 8 but more like a nut than barrel/wood with a teeth coating chew.
Overall man I wish this wasn't so hot. It feels like a typical hot young wine that needs to age maybe that will make it better? Would love to age this and try it again some day in the future. 1,536 characterssmakawhat, Sep 16, 2011

16.06.13 bottle dating
A: Pours a very healthy head into a tulip with heavy lacing. Dark muddy brown in color with tiny visible bubbles coming to the top of the glass.
S: There is a lot of bubblegum mixing with figs, dates, prunes, and plums. A dry belgian yeast aroma with caramelized sugars.
T: First sip was a little more bitter than I had expected. There is a deep fig taste with plenty of bittering characteristics, a dry tongue buckling presence of either oak barrels or a large dosing of bittering hops. There are caramelized sugars all over mixing nicely with a dark belgian candied sugar presence. 
M: Perfect mouthfeel really. There is a medium body with a mild carbonation. Slick rolling mouthfeel that stayed consistent.
O: It lived up to its name. Glad to try this before hitting up Belgium in a few weeks. I will be sure to take notes of all the other great beers I am trying out there. 946 charactersalpinebryant, Sep 16, 2011

A: Darker brown w/some red. Has a creamy/smooth, 1-finger head that's an off-white or cream color.
S: Great blend of subtle sweetness. Dark fruit. Definitely getting fig. 
T: Again, subtle sweetness that's VERY smooth and unbelievably well-balanced. Some bitterness and alcohol in the finish but not much. I did my best to savor this bottle but at the same time, I know I could put down a lot if an abundant supply was in front of me.
M: Carbonation is there but it's not very noticeable (the perfect amount, IMO). I wouldn't say it's thick although I am leaning in that direction.
O: Wasn't sure what I'd think after reading so much about it, but this definitely lives up to its reputation IMO. The overall balance is unreal and it was a complete pleasure to drink in almost every way. It is going to be a total challenge to save my 2nd bottle. 919 charactersalohaspicoli, Sep 15, 2011

Best by 10.03.13
Appearance
I've never seen a quad with a head like this, wow. Its very rocky and airy, but also very frothy. The froth is a dirty sand color. It leaves loose, torn off lacing all over the place. The beer got quite muddy after I added the bottom on the bottle. The bottle was perfectly settled, until my girlfriend knocked it over right before I was about to open it. Oh well. I got a few chunks in the thick head. The color is a nice purple-brown with plenty of red hues as well. 
Aroma
This stuff smells very good, but perhaps just short of exceptional in the ranks of all the amazing Belgian quads; Pannepot, Rochefort 10, St Bernardus 12 etc. There is a very familiar, comforting quality to this aroma. Bread pudding smells make up the bulk of this bouquet. It seems laced with cinnamon-sugar and rum, lots of spiced rum. Rum soaked dates and figs build a venerable middle. There are also notions of sourdough and/or a crusty dark bread. 
Taste
This stuff is quite sweet, but when done right, that's something I don't mind. The front of the initial sip was pure prune, raisin and fig. There is a lovely vanilla creaminess to the middle of this beer that I did not expect, but welcome heartily. All the way through there is a lot of spice and spicy rum-like alcohol. Honey-roasted/caramelized nuts come to mind as the beer warms. The dregs of the beer unlock a very nice candied banana taste, but the dregs also open up a rougher, more alcoholic, almost medicinal finish. 
Mouthfeel
There is a lot of carbonation, as to be expected from a beer that hissed so loudly upon opening and poured with such an immediate head. The carbonation is very fluffy, soft, smooth and pleasant, however. Even through a higher level of carbonation, this beer's thick body still is perceived as full. This beer is sweet, so its slightly sticky on the lips, but not enough to cause discomfort. 
Overall
This, perhaps, was the beer I have been most excited for from day one on BA. I never really hunted it, I knew it would always be there. Leave it to AleWatcher to make it happen for me when I wasn't even trying. This ended up being one of my favorite beers of what is probably my favorite style. I'll have to get more than one bottle of this soon. 2,369 charactersMbpBugeye, Sep 14, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a belgium strong ale Westvleteren goblet style glass at the actual brewery cafe. Reduced the smell point due to any volatiles may have been missed.
A - Pours a dark brown/red color, average carbonation, nice creamy stable head, lacing is sporadic on the glass wall.
S - Very complex, in order of effect, toffee, raisins, fig. 
T - The taste is so balanced, Toffee, with a yeasty bready background. Bitterness supports the malt, without any components such as resin/ harshness being apparent. 
M - Medium body, well rounded, with a smooth carbonation. Tiny, tiny bubbles. No cloying affect. Wonderful.
Overall - terrific, its a shame this is so hard for people to try. Its also a factor to bear in mind when trying to objectively review this beer. 761 charactersjascox2, Sep 11, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bottle into a goblet.
Appearance: Pours a clear dark reddish amber with a finger of very smooth off white head. A layer of head remains on top of the pour.
Smell: Sweet with dark fruit notes and some brown sugar/molasses hints. Mild Belgian spice. Everything blends together perfectly.
Taste: Sweet but not in a cloying way. Extremely smooth. Some Belgian spice with hints of brown sugar and dark fruit. There is a slight bitterness in the finish along with the sweetness. Hardly any alcohol taste at all.
Mouthfeel: Body is just on the thick side with smooth tingly carbonation and a slight dryness in the finish.
Overall: Just an amazing beer. Everything blends together perfectly. Kind of reminds me of a super smooth barleywine. I definitely want to have more in the future. 797 charactersoline73, Sep 11, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +2.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle cap is dated 09/08/09 so this bottle is 5 years old. One of the last few that I have left from the original case.
Pours with a murky brown/amber with a short-lived 1-finger tan head that falls to a partial cover without much lace.
The aroma is rich with dark fruits and candied sugar; it's very enticing and just smells warm and inviting.
The taste is a lot more of these tasty, dark fruits and candied sugar. It's noticeably sweet which could be a problem yet isn't in this beer. All of the flavors are still there but have mellowed quite nicely and, surprisingly so, I am able to detect just a hint of alcohol.
Mouthfeel is smooth and medium tending toward full with barely there carbonation that doesn't affect the taste adversely.
Overall: I have had about 15 bottles from this case over the past 5 years. I tried to space them out while giving/sharing the others. I hope this has diminished the hype/rarity factor so that I am not too swayed by those factors. So, even at 5 years this is a wonderful, tasty beer. I may have liked it better at 3 years or even fresh but it has held up well. For those who like Rochefort 10 or any other quads this is a beer that you must try. It may not live up to the hype, for some, but it's worth the try. Even my cat loved the drop I put on the table for her. I guess it's nearly impossible to do but I wish a USA company could replicate this beer. 1,401 charactersmeatyard, Sep 10, 2011

Bottle from Against the Grain, unknown dating.
Served in a Rochefort goblet, pours a dark brown colour with a thin tan bubbly head. Leaves a thin layer of lacing down the glassware.
Nose is very balanced; brown sugar, pear, apples, sweet malts, Belgian yeast.
Taste remains sweet, and is well rounded. Malt body highlighted by apple accents, light fruits and the distinct yeast strain. More brown sugar and grapes follow into the finish.
High carbonation and medium bodied mouthfeel.
Overall, I was pretty impressed with this Trappist concoction, figured the hype wouldn't live up to itself seeing as its not a preferred style of mine. However I must admit it was worth its price tag, albeit once...a must try. Top of its style for me, beats St. Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10 personally. Not something I would care to drink regularly thankfully given its rarity, and no where near best beer in the world.
But thats just me. 938 charactersheebes, Sep 06, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5What is there to say about the best beer in the world. In the end of March I got the Westvleteren 12, as a gift from my parents. This opened a hole new beer world for me. Before I have never heard of such rare and special beer. I always thought, and still do, that beer is there to share and enjoy. Therefore beer must be widely available. 
After this introduction to very special beers, my learning ladder looked like a speedway and as a result I am now on BA. Because special beers need to be shared.
OK enough chitchat;
A-Nice dark brown, hazy fluid with nice head that disappears slowly.
S- Wood, wine and peat
T- A very nice beer with nut flavors, some vanilla. A bit sweet in balance with the bitterness.
M- Creamy not sticky, just enough, carbonation slowly explodes in your mouth.
O- A good beer, but worlds best??? I don't think one can say there is only one best beer in the world.
Due to the availability issues, I would rather drink Trappistes Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12.
Today (13-09-2011) I tasted a Westy 12 once more at the 'Vrede' next to the monastery Sint-Sixtus. What a great beer!! We discovered (my buddy Ed and I) that when this beer is served, not to cold but say around 17-18 degrees Celcius, it is absolutely World Class. Nothing comes close. You can drink this beer anytime of the day and take any kind of meal with it, it will hold. 1,375 charactersMar02x, Sep 04, 2011
3.7/5  rDev -19.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I opened a 2006 bottle the other day with my girlfriend before she began an internship. Special woman, special beer, random day of the week.
Recent studies suggest that our perceptions have a lot to do with how we taste. Rarity, for example, has something to do with a positive reaction. Same with group pre-approval. So opening the A+ "best in the world" beer from BeerAdvocate, I suppose my expectations were already through the roof.
Sadly, they were let down. The appearance was dark, reddish at the seams, with good head and lacing even after five years in the bottle. But it's a bit too ruddy, and appears like it hasn't completely held together. The smell is pure, complex, and holds dates, raisins, caramel, candy, roastiness and smoke. It doesn't appeal strongly to my palate, but it's all there.
The taste is more of the same. Dates: dried and sugared. Sweet, with a yeasty alcohol finish. In the mouth it's relatively thick despite the age, and there's no doubting it's complexity. That said, I look forward to trying one fresh, because Rochefort 10 blew this out of the water.
Or maybe that's just my perception... 1,130 charactersafksports, Sep 03, 2011

Poured in to Duvel tulip. 
Bottle date on the cap was 3/12/11.
A - Poured a very murky dark brown colour with a small amount of khaki coloured head that disappeared quickly and left good lacing behind on the glass. 
S - A very interesting nose. Lots of fruit - raisins, figs, pear and apple come through. Sweet caramel, brown sugar and a slight sticky candy scent round out the nose. 
T - Similar to the nose. Apple, pear, plum, raisin and fig contribute a spectrum of fruit flavours to this beer. They are complimented by a sweetness with hints of dark caramel and brown sugar. The alcohol is slightly noticeable as well but is generally well hidden. The sweetness in this beer is perfect, which is something that I don't get very often. It is just enough to be noticeable yet not enough to dominate the palate, which makes this beer all the more complex. The apple flavour is really noticeable at times but without dominating either. Incredibly delicious and complex. 
M - Medium body. Smooth and somewhat chewy. Light carbonation. 
O - Absolutely lived up the they hype for me. Belgian ales are typically not one of my preferred styles and this is the first one I have had that I would drink every day if it was available. Truly remarkable. 1,388 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Sep 02, 2011

A little ripe, dried fig flavor nice malty sweetness, and a bit of bitter alcohol. There are other flavors of sweet stone fruit (cherries and dried peaches) in the beer and aroma. Clove-like phenols and toasty bread are more highly expressed when the beer warms.
This beer is a bit underwhelming, and maybe it was the age, but I found that I've liked St. Bernardus 12 and a couple other Quads I've had in the past better. 563 charactersSoonami, Aug 28, 2011

A - Poured out a slightly cloudy, burgundy color with a two-finger head of pillowy, off-white foam. The head was long lasting and left sudsy trails of lace down the sides of the glass.
S - Hard to explain how fantastic this aroma was. Everything was perfectly balanced - plum, fig, raisin, yeastiness, caramel, toffee. Nothing was strong or overpowered the other aromas. It was just perfect.
T - Again, so much balance. A perfect marriage of flavors. Dark dried fruits - fig, plum and raisin. Sweet maltiness with caramle, toffee and some molasses. A touch of yeasty spiciness.
M - So smooth! Medium bodied and crisp.
O - This is fantastic. Lives up to the hype. It was like a fantastic dessert or a flavorful steak that melts in your mouth. 779 characterszeff80, Aug 28, 2011

 Pours a super syrupy brown with nearly zero head on a careful pour. Smells very bready along with nuts and dark fruit. The taste is delicate brown sugar malt with several layers of sweetness. I pickup lots of belgian dark sugar and it reminds me a bit of a well aged barleywine, but not as thick or heavy. The mouthfeel is slick and a tad syrupy with a nice medium carbonation. Mild alchohol finish on it, but I loved it. 
Leaps and bounds better than the first Westy 12 I had that was full of sediment and aged on its side. 556 characterssarro, Aug 23, 2011

T: Wow, so flavorful and absolutely delicious. Layers upon layers of flavor. Starts sweet with dark malt, brown sugar and some molasses, followed by candied fruit with herbs and spices, a slight hint of alcohol and more brown sugar in the end followed by a long lingering melody of all the aforementioned flavors. 
M: Super smooth, somewhat creamy medium body with some tingling from the carbonation, finishes on the sweeter side.
O: So delicious and drinkable, could easily drink this every night for the rest of my life. Definitely the best quad that has crossed my taste buds. Simply incredible, wish this glass would last forever. 1,025 charactersAzurescens, Aug 16, 2011
3.62/5  rDev -21.5%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.533cl bottle poured into Grimbergen chalice
Best Before date 04 December 2010
A- Dark mahogany body with a lot of sediment. 2 finger creamy head with average retention and minimal lacing.
S- Toasted almonds, a little dark fruit, some rose petal sweetness and a touch of wholemeal bread. Overall aromas are subtle
T- Malt forward again. Wholemeal bread qualities come through again supported by a sweet malt backbone. No real suggestion of alcohol heat, very smooth.
M- Creamy with medium carbonation, full body. Very smooth considering abv
D- Appearance wise not amazing, Flavour/aromas are subdued i guess with age. Mouthfeel retains a lovely creaminess and full mouthfeel. Overall, not a beer i would say has enhanced with age. Certainly no developing complexties. Eventhough not drinking this beer before, i cant help but feel its lost some former glory. Would love to try fresh! 887 charactersseanyfo, Aug 14, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle split with a buddy. Didn't catch the date, but it was about 3 years out. 
Pours a hazy brownish copper with a tan head. The nose is slightly caramel and bready with dark fruits and plum. The taste is big, bready, yeasty plum with a touch of banana and other dark fruits and slightly caramel malts. Very smooth flavor with a very subtle complexity. Blink and you miss it. Good carbonation, good body. Overall, this is a very good beer, but it did not top the 25 year old Extra 8. Maybe worth trying once, then grab a Rochefort 10 given the relative difference in ease of acquisition. 590 charactersseeswo, Aug 12, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +6.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Brabander and another buddy of mine, I was able to procure 3 bottles of the Westy 12. Just cracked open the first one and it absolutely lived up to the hype. Amazing...
A: Dark brown with an aggressive tan head at the pour, the remnants of which linger for a while as I drink it.
S: Perfect. Dark fruits, delicious yeast are the most predominant aromas.
T: Wow...incredible. Dark fruits, yeast, brown sugar, a hint of molasses maybe. Absolutely delicious.
M: This beer is so incredibly easy to drink. It's actually kind of "light" feeling for a quad. Slightly overcarbonated to me...hence the deduction. Lingers on the palate just long enough but not too long to be cloying. I could definitely do multiples of this (if I were lucky enough to have a limitless supply).
Overall, this beer is phenomenal and worth of it's reputation. I love Quads, have tried a number of them, and this one is the undisputed king. I can't wait to have occasion to drink my last 2. 975 charactersbcostner1, Aug 11, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511.2oz bottle into chalice. From notes. Bottle dated 21.04.13.
A - This gem pours a murky, swampy brown with slight reddish and purple edge accents. Faint bubbly beige head quickly dissipated.
S - Lots of ripe purple fruits of plums, currants, raisins and black cherries. Distinct Belgian yeastiness adds that desired bread nose.
T - Very complex. Epitome of quad brew flavour profile, dark fruits, cherries, some pepper and amazing cloves. That bready yeast profile is nicely integrated and somewhat subdued. Wonderful experience
M - Ridiculously smooth, no ABV to me picked up, medium and caressing.
O - I was a bit skeptical going in as this is quite the highly hyped, idolized beer. However, the beer speaks for itself and completely crushes any of the perceived 'hype' surrounding. Delicious, and that's all. 818 charactersOakedCanuck, Aug 10, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512 oz. bottle at In De Vrede, in a chalice. Been dreaming of having this beer at this cafe for awhile.
A: Dark brown that lightens toward the edges. Frothy one and a half finger head with decent lacing immediately. A small layer stays suspended forever.
S: Huge cornucopia of dark fruits, candied figs, caramel, small esters, rather sweet. Sublimely balanced - it's really hard to pick anything out. Everything blends in an incredible way.
T: Full! So much, very rich. Rather sweet, a bit light. Alcohol presence has a great warming but not hot character. Some toasty grains. All the dark fruit is in there just like the nose. Wonderful Belgian yeast flavors. Just as well balanced as expected, everything blends to create a phenomenal flavor that seems unique in its complex unity.
M: Medium-heavy but still lively. Great.
O: Incredible! I don't know how much of that is the rare talking, but at the first sip I was blown away. Huge and bold, but still tame and so well balanced. 985 characterstsatem, Aug 09, 2011
4.06/5  rDev -11.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours an opaque brown with an off-white head. Almost 0 light was shining through the liquid which was pretty cool. 
Smell was slightly fruity, some raisins and dark fruits, with mostly caramel and booze coming through. 
The taste was very good, the mouthfeel was amazing, the booziness warmed the mouth and gave a great sensory experience while drinking it. 
This is an amazing beer, the fact that it is so hard to get and the recipe hasn't changed for thousands of years makes drinking it a great experience. I think the 8 was better, but this one was really good as well. 576 charactersmsfoster77, Aug 05, 2011

This is one of the finest quads I have had, but I can't say it lives up to the hype. I would rank this right along side the Rochefort 10, yet the unobtainability and buyer's remorse creates a mythical presence in this beer that causes to be catapulted to the top of any beer list. This is a fine beer that should certainly be seeked out. But is it definitively the best beer in the world? Probably not. 481 charactersTheTippler, Aug 05, 2011

4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5THE beer. Finally got another one in a recent trade. I decided to open it with a friend of mine and tonight just happened to be that night. Bottle poured into a chalice.
A - Pours murky brown with a start white one and a half finger head leaving small wisps of lacing down the glass.
S - Smells of dark fruits; like figs, prunes, and raisins; mixes with the sweet malt, chewy belgian yeast, and some damp earth. The alcohol creeps in as it comes to room temperature. 
T - Starts off with a sweet mix of dark fruits and candied sugar slowly giving way a mix of bready malts, spicy belgian yeast, caramel, toffee, molasses, and some chocolatey sweetness. The alcohol begins to rear its head as the ale comes to room temperature, drying the pallet. The finish is a mix of sugary sweetness and light heat from the alcohol. Amazingly balanced overall. 
M - Medium-Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. So damn smooth with a little bit of chewiness. The alcohol does become a bit tiresome over the course of the glass.
O - This is still one of my favorite beers of all time. From the dark, complex, flavors to the soft, velvety, feel you would be hard pressed to find a better quad. I can't wait for my next encounter with this amazing beer. 1,251 charactersorangesol, Aug 03, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottled 18.09.08 and cellar-aged. A wonderful present from my girlfriend for our anniversary.
A- Deep, opaque mahogany brown. One finger of eggshell white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a mild, creamy cap throughout consumption. Leaves minor silky lacing throughout. Surprisingly, only a small amount of sediment present here.
S- Caramel malt, walnuts, ripe grapes, Belgian yeast. A background of sour cherries and other dark fruit esters. A bit of alcohol.
T- The base is introduced with scrumptious, chewy malt goodness intertwined with rich caramel, bread/biscuit, and wonderfully balanced Belgian yeast. This is paired with a number of rich fruits - primarily red grape peel, figs, and ripe apricots. We are transitioned to a beautiful sweet finish, with walnut banana bread being the best way I can think to describe it. There is only a bit of warmth from the alcohol - it's hidden exceedingly well and what warmth does surface is only complimentary to the flavors present. As it warms, the fruit esters become more pronounced.
M- Wonderfully light for the style, and considering the complexity I was surprised with how easy-going the body was. Just a tingle of carbonation during transition to inject a little excitement. Primarily dry finish that works well with the nutty aftertaste.
O- What can I say that hasn't been said already... This is quite simply the best tasting beer I've ever had. Considering the relative difficulty in obtaining it, I'm not sure how many times in my life I will get to taste this beer again, but I'm very glad I had to opportunity to do so. If you have the chance, make every effort to experience this masterpiece. 1,666 charactersseabass87, Aug 01, 2011

4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Second Westy to get through was the 12, as I decided to lead things off with the 8 the other day. I fell in love with the 8 - how will the 12 hold up? 
Thanks again to Jeffo for bringing a crate of this back in the Great Canadian Westy Trade 2011! 
Poured into a Duvel goblet. A nice, murky chestnut brown colour, with a slight reddish tinge. A billowing pile of off-white head sat upon the brew and refused to leave. By the end of the bottle, there was still a thick ring and scads of lacing. A terrific looking brew.
Great nose to it as well: raisins, booze, candied fruit, chocolate, all sorts of goodies. Not quite as potent and rich as 8 (which I will inevitably be comparing this to, despite being different styles), but still terrific.
A great quad, rich and spicy, with those same fruit notes (raisin, dry white wine, raspberry), spices, a bit of chocolate, warming alcohol and a drying finish. Exceptional stuff, really enjoying this.
Tart carbonation, but coats the tongue well and leaves a nice slick feel. The booze stings ever so slightly.
Gotta put the 8 a hair above this brew, but damn is it close. I think it comes down to personal preference - I prefer dubbels to quads or tripels (I'd make a lousy figure skater) as a general rule. However, I do enjoy a fine quadrupel, and this is most certainly among the top of its class. 1,349 charactersJohnnyBarman, Jul 25, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Best before on cap is 24.09.13. 
Beer is brown with reddish hints. Minimal white head fades quick;y. Not as dark as I would have expected the beer to be.
Smell is excellent. Dark fruit (plum, red grapes, fig) and brown sugar. A complex and enveloping smell. A bit of alcohol is present, but only slightly. Gives the nose a bit of a sterness that is nice.
Taste is fantastic. Just like smell, but more. Again we have dark fruit, plum, fig, red grape and some brown sugar, with a somewhat dry finish. The beer has a lot of fruit in it, but is not juicy. Almost tastes like a rich syrup. A warming alcohol flavour runs alongside the other flavours, not overpowering but present.
Beer is full bodied, with a medium amount of carbonation that is perfect. Beer is active, but not irritating- very minute bubbles.
Overall, truly an excellent beer. Given the availability and price disparities, I would go for the Rochefort 10, but this is just wonderful. Glad I got to try it. 974 charactersjrenihan, Jul 22, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Here it is. What, by many accounts, is the best beer in the entire world. Purchased at Bier Tempel in Brussels, along with the 8 and the Blond. Carried to Bruges until I realised I didn't have a bottle opener. After I attempted to prise off the cap with the edge of the table and the toilet-roll dispenser in the hotel room, my girlfriend became bemused and went out to buy me a bottle opener.
To the big question, however: can a beer this hyped live up to its expectations?
Freshness date of 20/04/14 stamped on the cap.
Pours a murky red brown, deeply coloured with amazingly fine carbonation feeding a modest, but amazingly fine-bubbled head. Lacing is thick and creamy, like uncooked meringue. Body is light, but slick looking, holding some of that fine carbonation when tilted. The bead is what makes this beer look so very refined. It's an absolutely lovely lookjng brew.
Nose is fine and light, tantalisingly giving off its aromas of spicy esters, fruity tannins and portlike booze. Slight tingle of lemon acidity to it as well. To be perfectly honest, though, its a lot less robust than I expected. The characters are very pleasant, and nicely balanced, but I've had beers with similar characters that have been fuller and more intoxicating. I'm not saying the subtlety here is bad. Just surprising.
Taste is lovely, however. Broad and long, giving wonderful complexity over the tongue, and developing as time passes along its length. Characters of raisins, tea leaf, red grapes, banana skin, rosemary, vanilla, cherry brandy, with a boozy and mildly astringent finish that you think is there to clean it up, but in fact just adds its own subtle complexity. Feel is sublime, just so smooth and supple and slick and thinly creamy. Now I understand the lack of body. Any more, and you'd look at overwhelming the subtle complexities.
I don't think I've had a better Belgian. This is top of the style easily, and it does easily warrant such an impressive place in the beer ethos. But, no, it's not the best beer in the world. The best beer in the world is still out there somewhere, tantalising me with its mythical presence. Some day, I will find it.
And unless I want to think that it's all downhill from here, I have to believe that until the end of my beer-drinking days. 2,286 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 20, 2011

Pour is liquid caramel topped by a soft yellowish beige head. 
The aroma had a complex combination of fruits, brown sugar, moderately sweet caramel/toffee like malts, and vanilla. 
The flavor is again very complex: malty, sweet, brown sugar, fruity (raisin, others), vanilla, spices, and some alcohol. 
This seemed to have some oxidation going on, but it was spectacular nonetheless. Medium bodied with good carbonation. I may need to seek out more bottles for a follow up try soon. 520 charactersajsdad06, Jul 18, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -4.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I will probably never forget the afternoon when Andrés, my student at UD, walked into my office with the gift of a bottle of Westvleteren 12. ‘Twas an amazingly generous and extraordinarily well-received gesture. He’d hand-imported it to the States after an enviable tour of Belgian and northern France, where he went to visit his sister. Rebecca and I are splitting this special treat on one of the final nights of packing up for our move from the apartment in Newark to our new place, in celebration of what’s been accomplished, and in anticipation of the glory to come. ¡Salud, Andrés!
Appearance:
Rich mahogany brown capped with a few fingers of foamy white head, which quickly reduces to a sticky film. Very impressive clarity. Inviting, appearance is not the strongest card in this one’s hand...
Smell:
Fruity yeast esters kick things off, tinged toward the dry and dark. Prunes, raisins, wood, dry dark cherry. Layers and layers of complexity; it seems like the longer you smell this, the more you pick out. Figs galore. Creamy, lemony, sweet, light, fruity as well. Maybe even vanilla? Alcohol pokes through but is by no means overwhelming.
Taste:
Juicy, vinous. More dried fruit. Super complex, subtle, and layered. Moreish to an extreme—I would need several more bottles to really wrap my mind around this one completely. Caramel and deep rich pumpernickel crust peek through at the end. Peach soaked in brandy. The alcohol comes out more as it warms.
Mouthfeel:
Chewy and thick, yet light-bodied as it lingers in the mouth. Light, smooth carbonation that is barely noticeable.
Drinkability:
Utterly complex and unique; who wouldn’t want to drink it? Frankly, both the missus and I were expecting this one to disappoint a bit, given its chargin’ hype train, and the fact that a Belgian quadrupel is not really a go-to style for me. This one, however, has won us over completely with its subtle complexity. There are other beers that have blown my mind more personally, but I can’t think of any that have matched this one in its refinement. Subtle, but super-assertive. Certainly nobody’s session beer, but one that I would love to have on ANY occasion. 2,188 charactersTaddyPorter, Jul 18, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from Notes: I had this amazing brew on a trip to Europe that was as equally amazing. Sampled at In De Vrede in the shadow of the abbey of Saint Sixtus, it really doesn't get any better than that. This nectar of the Gods pours a lovely dark brown color, aroma is of fruit, plumbs and sugar canes. As soon as you take a sip you realize that this beer lives up to the hype..Does it get any better than this? NO. This beer coats the tongue in sweet fruit flavors and the alcohol is so well hidden that you are not aware of the effects. That is until you walk down the path at Westvleteren to the shrine and realize that you are extremely drunk. This is OK you remind yourself, as you are in Europe at the Mecca for all beer drinkers. If you ever have the chance to visit PLEASE do..you will not be disappointed. We purchased some at De Bier Temple in Brussels. The lady there has plenty to go around, so if you miss the "Beer line" or all orders are full, fear not she has you covered. Do yourself a favor and grab a Westy, it is what the Gods Drink!

4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this at room temp in Belgium and couldn't note any differences between it and Rochefort (from memory). I suppose a review is appropriate after I've returned to the States for a while.
This review is from a cellared bottle, 20.04.14 dating on the cap. Thijs, you are the MAN!!!
A - Good color. Deep brownish-red. Head retention is great. I couldn't ask more from a beer, especially this style. Once again, I'll give this a top rating for style appearance. Head retention is beautiful after the 30 minutes it took me to review this beer.
S - Wow. It took me a bit, but I've actually pinned the aroma down to white grape juice. Yep, you read that right. The more time I spend sniffing, I guess I would say that it smells like a bready smashed handfull of grapes. I am seriously getting bready grapes here. That may sound crazy, but that's what I get. Then again, the beer is still at around 40 degrees Fahrenheit. I get a little more bread as I walk away for 15 minutes and return. I still smell some sweet grapes though. I'm not sure if a quad "should" smell like this, but it is a great aroma. Who am I to tell the Monks what a quad "should" smell like.
T - I should put it next to Rochefort 10, and I will, the next time I open a bottle. I get a slight grape that quickly moves to a bready quad flavor, then to a dry grape finish. Grape is the only way I can think to describe it. It isn't like a wine or Lambic. There is a bread-like flavor on top with an underlying sweetness that is comparable to eating red/purple grapes. This is a very unique flavor. I actually think I'm in love. I have given a few of these out to people as extras since I've been back from Belgium, but I think I will keep the rest after trying this one.
M - An odd medium-thick body. It's right in the middle, but I think that it is probably best described as a medium body with creaminess that creates almost a thicker mouthfeel. Fantastic. The flavors stick to the palate after each sip. This is just one more reason for me to love this beer.
O - Damn. Sorry, I hate to use this language in a review, but Damn. I've only had one beer that stood out as an equal or superior to this (hahaha, thanks Urbain!). To each his own, but I love this beer. I could slam this beer upon request. I would happily drink this and only this for the rest of my life if I had to. This is so much better than the one I had in an Antwerp hotel room. And to think that I've been telling people that it is no better than Rochefort.
NOTE: eBay prices are far too much for a bottle. Please don't buy these bottles from that site. The practice is against the wishes of the Monks and in an unbelievable inflation of the prices for each bottle. If you really need a small number of bottles, please post to the Belgium forum and I'm almost certain that you will be taken care of. 2,840 charactersclaaark13, Jul 01, 2011

A: Dark copper brown color with a small tan head of foam.

T: Sweet caramel front with a backing of raisins and figs. The alcohol becomes more noticeable as you get further into the beer.
M: High level of carbonation with a warm alcoholic feel.
O: Extremely complex and impressive quad. I was absolutely impressed at how well the alcohol is masked. Sure, you can tell it's there, but at 10.2% you'd think it would be more noticeable. Definitely worth the hype. I brought a bottle home with me to cellar. Current plan is break it out for a special occasion in a year or so. 756 charactersdistantmantra, Jul 01, 2011

Taste is a complex mash up of sweet elements. I get plum, cotton candy, banana and vanilla. Big smooth sweet presence and really nice taste.
Mouthfeel is creamy and thick with moderate to high carbonation. Very well done here.
Overall there is just something amazingly drinkable and smooth about this big flavorful beer. Almost silky on the palate. Rounded flavors, I'm impressed. 624 characterspdoran10, Jun 30, 2011

The nose is pounding with grape/honey/wood. On the tongue it is sweet, quite sweet, grapes or raisins, then the alcohol bites you in the rear, but subtly. Mouthfeel is excellent, goes well with the fruity explosion. Overall, the Westy definitely lives up to the hype and I was very excited to drink it. 412 charactersSDDanC, Jun 29, 2011

4.63/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5First had: bottle from Brouwerij Westvleteren (via a German friend)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4Qh-YmW2SM
Oh the hype! Was it worth it? Well, sure. I've heard mixed reports on this beer, and from my experience, many true beer aficionados out in the "real world" will tell you, that the main appeal of this beer is it's unavailability, not it's features, and that in fact, a fine Rochefort or even St. Bernardus is as good as or even better than a Westvleteren. So in the end, it's just a matter of opinion, like anything else.
That said, this was a great beer. I acquired the bottle legitimately: a friend of a friend of mine traveled to Westvleteren and respectfully procured me a few bottles from the elusive monks.
My at-the-time fianceé and I each had a bottle, we shared one with friends at our engagement party, I used one for a video review, and I have four that I'm cellaring, with one or two perhaps for trade.
Anyway, on to the review, as you can see from the video, this beer was properly poured into a signature Westvleteren goblet. Dark caramelized brown in color, hazy, moderately carbonated, with a beautifully crafted light tan head that settled right around the "Trappist" logo of the glass, retained throughout the session, and exhibited some fine lacing. Robust aroma, dark fruits, dark sugars. Extremely full of flavor, smooth, candi sugars, toffee, dark cherries, raisins, alcohol is noticeable but not at all detrimental. Earthy, organic, chewy, complex... Medium mouthfeel, but full of flavor, slightly bitter aftertaste, and very drinkable. 1,575 charactersRifugium, Jun 28, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Picked a few bottles up at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam. Initially, I was going to wait until I got back to the States to indulge...but the excitement got the better of me. 
I poured the beer in a Chimay chalice. Dark and beautiful...but still transparent. 
The smell was complex and earthy. Dried fruit and dark sugar.
Huge build-up to my first taste, and it was not disappointing. Fruity, floral, boozy, earthy. Thick and very complex...it's difficult to point out each individual flavor, because they interact with each other. It was more carbonated than I thought, but the mouthfeel was still great. 
Hard to tell if this is the best beer that I have ever had, but I will always remember the day in Nice, France when I first tried this beer. This beer wins for my favorite "beer moment". 793 charactersJPBCrown, Jun 27, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Drunk this, the Stanley Cup of beers, to celebrate the Bruins Stanley Cup win. And I love how the crown cork is black and gold. Coincidence? I think not. 
But you know, I am sort of skeptical of all the reviews of this beer on BA. Not that I believe that this beer is over rated. Not at all. It definitely deserves its status. Its just that I can't see how everyone understands this beer after just one bottle. Westy 12 just way too complex for that.
Pours a lovely deep mahognay colour maintaining a creamy full thick head which leaves sticking drifts of foam all over the glass.
Taste is where its complexity really comes in on the tongue. There is earth, toffee, dark chocoate and a cutting form of sweet, fine and fairly intense custard cream richness. There's a deep thick oakiness there too especially with the body. An unbelievably complex balance of strength, finesse and complexity. Aftertaste is very very long and has left an impression on my taste buds like no other beer.
Despite its religious inspiration this really is a beer that strikes at your intellect and curiosity more than the heart. For me this is what makes it so inspiring. I'm still very much just beginning to understanding Westy 12 but I can recognise its genius which would have totally missed me had I drunk it as a beer rookie many years ago. And this is what makes me think that people here award it top marks based on reputation alone. Either that or BAs really have some of the most sophisticated and perceptive palates you'll find anywhere. 1,529 charactersZimbo, Jun 26, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Jason for sharing this rare gem with me at the bottle share! Pours a murky brown color with a small tan head that sticks around for a little. Scent is delicious candied dark fruits and brown sugar. Taste is initially sweet caramel, followed by figs and prunes. Lots of dark fruits with hints of green apple, molasses, and brown sugar. There is also some alcohol taste to it, but not overwhelming at all. The complexity of this beer is ridiculous. Mouthfeel is extremely dry and full-bodied. Well-balanced. Drinkability is VERY HIGH for the ABV. Overall, this beer is outstanding and I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it. However, the beer does not blow Rochefort 10 outta the water, so I'm not sure if it's worth all the trouble getting one. 759 charactersDovaliHops, Jun 24, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -10.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4poured into a tulip, courtesy of a birthday present - thank brosephus!
pours a nice, dark brown, slightly cloudy. head was extremely underwhelming, aggressive pour and it barely mustered a quarter inch. nice aroma - raisins, dark rum, carmelized sugars, a lot going on. 
broad range of tastes on the tongue - again lots of dark fruit, brown sugar, alcohol warms on the back end. this beer was a bit thinner than i was prepared for, although it did continue to open up nicely for at least 20 minutes.
overall - very nice beer, would gladly drink it again and was thrilled i finally got to try it. but i'm not understanding the holy grail status. 647 charactersrobbrandes, Jun 16, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- Dark brown color with a head that sticks around a long time and alot of lacing.
S- Alot less of a scent then I would have thought. I get alot of the yeast and some dark fruit.
T- Extremely complex taste. Malt, raisin, prune, date, malt, nuts. 
M- Smooth and no big alcohol bite. It's a big beer, but it goes down very easily.
O- If this were local and reasonably priced I could easily drink this on a regular basis. Definitely lived up to the hype and I will seek this out again. 486 charactersRick187, Jun 14, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- Pours a super dark brown color with a perfect two finger chocolate head. Head sticks around a long time, and there's massive lacing on my goblet. Good carbonation too. Can't really see through this one, but it's not a black hole like some beers are. This looks like one serious Quad, and I really can't find a fault w/ it- it's really a beautiful looking beer. 
S- The smell is slightly less pungent than I thought it would be, but it's still really good. Caramel, malt, fruit, yeast, alcohol all make their presence known. Maybe some nut in there as well? It definitely gets better the warmer it gets. Really opens up. Very nice.
T- Wow. Super complex taste. Caramel, malt, raisin, prune, date, hint of chocolate, licorice.. Maybe some more as well. There seems to be no end to the flavor profile of this beer, and it keeps improving the more I sip it. Warming also really opens this beer up. Pretty amazing! I don't get much alcohol, just a little on the aftertaste. This beer definitely lives up to the hype- it's a remarkable brew, and I can understand why it lives in the top 3 beers in the rankings. 
M- Big, smooth, slightly chewy without being overwhelming or heavy. Exceptional feel. I can't really imagine it getting much better than this for the style.
O- I've had Westy 12 a couple times now. Once was pretty good, but this batch seems to be a step up from the last time I had it. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever had, and one of my favorite styles as well. If you get a chance to try this beer, you'll never forget it. It's a masterpiece that gets better w/ every sip. Cheers, Advocates! 1,617 charactersjayhawk73, Jun 11, 2011
4.07/5  rDev -11.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Best before date: 15.06.04 (June 15, 2004) It's my understanding the Westvleteren beers are bottled 3 years prior to the best before date. Which makes this beer almost ten years old to the day! The alcohol content is also a bit higher @ 10.8%. 
Purchased through Cracked Kettle, Netherlands
Price - Lost record, I'm sure it was expensive...
I purchased this a few years back before I was keeping receipts. 
Popped the cap and bam, a flow of foam gushes out of the bottle. A quick pour in my glass reveals a two inch creamy foam head that fizzles out after a few minutes leaving behind the scene of a cloudy sky. Polka dotted lacing stains the glass after several sips. The color is brown with quite a bit of yeast sediment.
The aroma is fairly strong and pleasent. Full of caramel, red grapes, candy sugar and spices. 
The flavor is sweet malt, caramel and dark fruit with some earthy notes.
The mouthfeel is medium in body, soft and smooth with plenty of carbonation. Unfortunately a metallic bitter aftertaste sneaks in and kills the overall enjoyment. 
I think the age of this bottle is certainly bringing it down a bit. I have several newer versions and will update this review to reflect the best buy date. 1,218 characters05Harley, Jun 09, 2011

T: The beer has a nice bitter woodiness balanced perfectly with some nice sweet dried fruit. Not too heavy but really has a good weight 
M/O: Very good carbonation and presentation even after aged for a year. Very good balance with strong alcohol aroma but not overpowering the flavor or the texture This beer is balanced on a knifes edge presenting weight and superior drinkability. 547 characterspzrhsau, Jun 08, 2011

A: Brown hue with lighter brown highlights and a bubbly off white head. Cloudy look. 
S: Smell is dense with bready/dark bread malt character thats dry but not overly sweet smelling. Savory for sure in terms of the grain in there. Some ripened dark fruits abound with a little syrup and nutty notes. 
T: Follows the smell but it is not as vibrant as the aroma forshadowed, sort of falls flat over part of the palate though what is there is good for sure: Some almost citrus like twists accompany a ton of dry caramel, chestnut, cinnamon, and of course plenty of grain. There are other quads I enjoy far more than this that are much easier to get!
M: Medium feel with lots of carbonation. Smooth and nice overall. 937 charactersDreadnaught33, Jun 06, 2011

As expected, poured a dark, yet clear beer with alot of yeast and nice head.
Taste: Raisins, dark candy fruit, a spiciness. I'm actually surprised at the lack of complexity. To me, a nice Dark Strong Ale, but overall not as enjoyable as some others. I realize this is the "king" of DSA, but to me, not the best.
Overall: Wonder full, I'm glad I tried it, but I prefer some others. Particularly given the cost and difficulty getting this. Perhaps some fresh from the brewer would be ideal. 540 charactersjbonapar, Jun 04, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5200th Review!
A: Pours a very dark and murky Coca Cola-looking brown color with very little head. I wasn't super impressed by the appearance.
S: And here we go. Simply put, I have never smelled a beer that smells this good. It's incredible. I found it nearly impossible to pinpoint all the smells. I got notes of brandy-soaked raisins, fruitcake, chocolate, tons of dark fruit, molasses, some overripe banana and a bit of jackfruit. Unbelievable.
T: Lots of raisin and brown sugar flavor upfront along with some brandy. Hints of plum and raisin on the finish along with a nice warmness on the way down. Some spiciness and a bit of white pepper to be found in this as well. Well worth it's reputation. I don't know if it's my favorite beer ever (still a sucker for Abyss), but this is a stellar beer. 802 charactersnotchucknorris, Jun 04, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought this fine beer from the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam. Waited until I returned to the states to drink it.
A: Cloudy, chocolate color with a tan colored head.
S: Bread. Kinda like sourdough. A hint of raisins, dates, and plums, along with cherries. 
T: Expected the alcohol to give this beer a nice kick, but the beer masks the ABV well. The taste starts off rather sweet, with a little bitterness in the aftertaste. 
M: Somewhere between a light and a medium body. I expected the beer to be much thicker than it was. The thin-ness definitely enhanced the experience, as I expected it to be rather syrupy.
OVERALL: A very nice beer. Maybe it was all the hype, but I can definitely see how this is voted the best beer in the world. The complexity was remarkable. Quadrupels are not my favorite style, but I thoroughly enjoyed Westvleteren 12. If it wasn't so expensive and so damn hard to get, I would definitely put this beer in my rotation. 950 charactersmcguirmn, Jun 01, 2011

This pours out with a murky brown color with some orange highlights, the head is kind of minimals but has a little white ring around the glass. The smell of this beer is very good. Lots of sweet fruit aromas a little Belgian yeast on the nose. Not much in way or hops. The taste is very good, the flavors of apple, fig, and white grapes all come together in a very nice combo. When the beer is colder the mouthfeel is a little thicker feeling. Once it warms up it thins out and the booze aromas start to show. The beer as a whole is very good. It's incredibly easy to drink, it's great to savor over the course an hour if you want to. The finish is dry but smooth and overall just really nice. I can see why people love it so much. 898 charactersKnapp85, May 30, 2011

Taste is much like the nose, figs, dates, rasains, brown sugar molasses, vanilla and some bready yeast Alcohol is hidden well here.

4.3/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Decided tonight was the night to finally give this beer a try - been sitting on a couple bottles for a few months now. It was an 8/2010 bottle, so about nine months old. Consumed from an Orval chalice. The beer gave a strong hiss on opening the bottle, and after pouring filled the chalice to the absolute rim with about a finger of a gradient of light brown to frothy white foam. The head receded after a bit, leaving a minimal amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. The beer was a rich brown, with amber highlights around the edges.
The smell was a blend of date & fig, sweet brown sugar and a bready yeastiness. The taste followed right along with where the nose was leading, but stepped up the complexity with additional elements. A peppery spiciness was there along with the candied dark fruits, a little bit of a vanilla and warming alcohol. This is an extremely well rounded and balanced quad flavor. The feel was equally as pleasant - full bodied, with a medium amount of carbonation. The finish was fantastic and imparted no harsh alcohol component. Overall this was a real treat to try - I don't know if after one bottle I'm ready to place it above some of my other quad favorites (St. B, Rochefort 10) but it is definitely a member of the exclusive group of top tier beers of this style. 1,307 characterssurlytheduff, May 29, 2011

A: Big fluffy off white head accompanied by some sediment. An exceptional brown with a ruby hue. Lots of "floaties." Heads 
S: Strong port wine, not sure if my nose is off but that is what I am getting. Bready with lots of dark fruits. I think that is where the port wine is coming from...
T: Oh my word! This is far more than I expected. Big bread and fruit just like the smell. There are definitely some spices, not sure what it is though? Not getting much alcohol but this bottle has a little age on it. More robust flavors of bread and plum arise as it warms. Fantastic.
O: I love this beer and will most likely be ISO more, a great treat. Glad I got to try this! 734 charactersAlpar, May 28, 2011

I opened the 2010 bottle that I had, and really am a fan. I did this side-by-side with a 2003 bottle and much preferred the newer, fresher version. It was a very interesting beer, definitely had a ton of taste and some fruit flavor to it. It was very strong, but even for a quad, I didn't get a strong burn or anything like that from the alcohol. I am interested to open my 2008 and do a test of the middle-of-the-road version. 495 charactersrhodeska, May 25, 2011

The aroma is full of plums and yeasty pepper. I really like the balance of sweet and spice in the aroma.
The taste is nice and sweet with dates, figs, and a hearty dose of brown sugar and cinnamon. The finish is a little drier with some peppery spice.
The body is medium to heavy and the carbonation is slightly prickly, helping out the sweetness. This is a nice sipper.
I don't think it's MY favorite, but it's very delicious and complex. 624 charactersandrewinski1, May 20, 2011

Thanks for the hook up Craytonic! Split with Andy and poured into a tulip. This one pours a murky brown with about an inch of white head. It settles to foam with some soapy lace.
The aroma is full of dark fruits with with hints of toffee. Plums and raisins with grape skins and a bit of booze. Lots of grapes in the aroma. Fruity and sweet with a tanic aroma. Hints of molasses sweetbess yo front with lots of dark fruits. Tanic flavors like grapes. This one is a bit on the boozey side though. It finishes with a really nice caramel sweetness to it with a touch of grassy hops. 
The feel on this is nice. Really a dry beer with a full body. Soft carbonation makes this one really nice. Overall, this is clearly a well made beer. For my money, I can get stuff stateside that I'll be just as happy with. But don't get me wrong, this one is a rare treat that I'll accept anytime. 980 charactersBendurgin, May 20, 2011

A: Pour is murky dark brown with a medium large tan head that sinks into great lacings.
S: A rich full smell with lots of sweet malt. A nice mix of bitter and floral hops - lots of dark fruits. Complex, yeasty and spicy.
T: Malty, very malty - sweet, but not to sweet. Some yeast and faint alcohol with spices. A very complex and well balanced beer. Again both floral and bitter hops. Rich dark dried fruits, almost like molasses. 
M: A really long after-taste with a creamy sence and both bitter and sweet. Full bodied and mild carbonation. 
O: One of the best beers in the world? Well in my opinion: it's clearly a fantastic beer, and in comparison to the St. Bernardus; It's very similar in taste and smell, but in this beer the smell and taste are so much stronger. When it comes to quads; this one is very nice, but I prefer Rochefort 10. 979 charactersEvil_Pidde, May 19, 2011

Screw Kyle on this one, thanks to mdfb79 for this taste.
First off a Westy 12, are you serious!?!?!?!?!...Dude, you're the man. And I'm so glad I came over to help Kyle out, this was all the reward I needed.
This beer pours a cloudy dark amber color. I'm guessing some dark Belgian ale. The aroma is actually rather yeasty in nature, like that of rising bread. Though for smelling like yeast, it's oddly pleasant, usually I don't say that. Wow, this tastes worlds different then it smells. There are plums and figs and berries all with a sweet dark caramel sugar flavor. Some spices from either additions or the yeast itself. This is really tasty for a Belgian, if that's the case. I've also changed my opinion to narrow it down to a BDSA or Quad, but since IMHO those are the same, I consider myself right. The reason of this narrowing is that this beer is pretty boozy. It isn't enough to hurt the flavor, but it's not really all that pleasant either. Overall this is a pretty darn good beer. My guess is it could use some time.
May I just express my disappointment at how regular this was for the top beer in the world. 1,150 charactersVdubb86, May 18, 2011

No thanks is big enough for mdfb79 for this bottle!
Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF Round 5. Cap reads 06.10.13. It pours a dark, semi-cloudy burnt auburn topped by a healthy tower of cream foam. The nose comprises dark greens, black pepper, clove, very bready yeast, nutmeg, figs, and light cocoa. The taste holds notes of cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, nutmeg, mild milk chocolate, Belgian yeast, light citrus peel, light cardamom, dark greens, candi sugar, and grass. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light-ish moderate carbonation and an almost astringently chewily dry finish. Overall, this stuff was indeed tasty (and admittedly a little young), but it felt a bit wrong on my tongue. Honestly, I generally enjoyed it, but I've had plenty of better quads in my day. 829 charactersTMoney2591, May 15, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I decided to review this beer not because I could possibly add anything others have not already, but because this beer somehow is rated the same as pliny the younger. And although I haven't had that beer but the similarly rated elder, I feel there has to be some justice in this world. The pliny is a very good beer, I must admit, and it is a completely different beast, but I don't think it inhabits the same universe as Westvleteren. Westvleteren is a perfect beer. It is not THE perfect beer. But it is, IMHO, absolutely great. It is just so perfectly balanced. It really is a 5 out of 5 sort of a beer. If you have the money and the great luck to find it somehow, you must try it. 684 charactersdelmet, May 15, 2011

Pours a deep brown color with a thin tan head that has nice retention. When held up to the light some amber tints show through.
Smell of raisins and plums with a solid candied sugar backbone. Taste of mostly raisins with lots of sweetness up front. Overall just a very smooth impression. Very complex flavors but somehow presented in a very clean way.
Overall an obviously world class beer. Not sure if I agree that it's the best in the world but it is good. Would grab this any time I have the chance. 783 charactersbeermanbrian, May 15, 2011

Pours a hazy ruby brown color with a half inch of head. Head fades quickly leaving no lacing, but there are bubbles comming up from the Chimay C on the goblet.
Smells like tawny port and bread. I would say, figs, prunes, dates, bread, alcohol, raisons, slight orange, chocolate, caramel, and a hint of molassas. It smells...good.
Taste opens with raisons and plums, moves into more fruit and alcohol, finishes with a strong caramel sweetness. Lasting impression is fruity in the mouth with an off tasting alcohol flavor. The alcohol flavor really brings this down...age that sucker.
Mouthfeel is nice, good carbonation and plenty thick.
Overall, its good, no where near the best. Give me a Rochefort 10 and call it a day. 841 charactersbs870621345, May 14, 2011

Pours a dark brown with amber hints at the edges. There is plenty of sediment as this was bottled March of 2009. I didn't pour it violently, and not really any head formed. I probably needed to pour a little more forcefully as I babied it too much. Lightly carbonated and little to no lacing...
Aromas are rich and complex. I get a lot of fig, raisin, some applesauce, A hint of brown sugar. The aroma profile is very robust, too. Maybe a hint of bubblegum, too. Overall a quite sweet and rich smelling beer.
Oh, yeah - the Basics: No idea on price and 10.2% ABV...
The beer lacks carbonation. That's too bad. It must simply be a case of storage. Very rich and malty upfront, and very sweet. I get a ton of caramel malt, brown sugar, and raisin flavors, just as was suggested by the aroma profile. Middle sees it round out somewhat and show off more of the yeast. I get a touch of bitterness from this and then it quickly morphs into the finish where the yeast character takes us to the finish line. I have to say that, even considering how hyped it was, and I certainly was expecting a lot, this is not nearly as good as even St. Bernardus ABT 12 or Pliny the Younger (I know, not a quad, but a better beer for sure). I'm not certain a better stored or fresher bottle would have made a huge difference. If the carbonation wasn't completely gone, I'm sure I'd like it more. As it is, the flavors don't burst and it is overall simply too sweet...bummer...
What I like most: The wonderful aroma profile.
What I like least: The complete lack of carbonation.
Verdict: Unfortunately, this doesn't pass even the second tier of quads I have had, and unfortunately it's not the Monks' fault as this is simply a question of poor storage...what a bummer. 1,905 charactersSolomonGrundy, May 14, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512 oz bottle courtesy of cmurren25, many thanks to you Chad! Had this as part of a horizontal tasting with Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12. Pours a dark brown color with a creamy, large and voluminous tan head. Very good looking brew.
The westy has the best nose of the three trappist quads with a nice balance of fruit, caramel and light roast.
Lots of chocolate and bready yeast. I am surprised by the amount of roast this has! A bit of an earthier, woody tone to it compared to the St. Bernardus and Rochefort. Body is just about right, not quite chewy but plenty viscous. This most certainly is a world class beverage, but I am pretty surprised at how close St. Bernardus comes to this. The Rochefort came in a distant third for me. Great beer, cant wait to try one in Belgium one of these days... 805 characterstwiggamortis420, May 14, 2011

Overall a very good belgium quad. Not really sure if it deserves the number 1 overall beer, but thats maybe because it's not my favorite style. 260 charactersjckp64, May 13, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared by colonelforbin. Big thanks Mike. Bottled on 15 December 2009. Pours a cola brown with a small light that has very good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. A little big of yeast can be seen floating in it. Aroma is big dark, plum, raisin, light brown sugar, a light nuttiness, Belgian yeast, and light alcohol. The taste is sweet with raisin, plum, brown sugar, hints of nuts. No alcohol to be found in the taste. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Really smooth for being such a big beer. A very good beer. Certainly one of the best quads I had. I wouldn't say it was one of my personal favorites, but I can certainly see how it has the reputation that it does. 700 charactersjethrodium, May 11, 2011

Poured in trappist glass a murky brown with a pretty thin white head. 
Immediately smacking you in the face is an aroma of dark fruits - grapes, figs, plums, and most of all, dates. I didn’t get much malt but there was definitely a bit of spices in there. 
Taste was about the same. Huge dark fruit explosion. Dates were the prevailing fruit taste in the beer. It was smooth and had a pretty dry finish. 
The alcohol came through on the palate but not in a bad way. What an awesome brew. I wish I had a case of this 617 charactersSpencerDB, May 11, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4A: opaque chocolate brown, tan creamy head. 
S: fresh sourdough bread dough, raspberry jam, cherries, apple juice. 
T: yeasty and biscuity at first, the middle tastes almost exactly like malt extract, just as sickly sweet and syrupy, slight bitterness on the finish. There's almost no suggestion of the alcohol, which is crazy considering the ABV.
M: light to medium bodied, a little on the thin side, low carbonation, syrupy finish.
O: overall a decent beer, but there are some things I felt it was lacking. I wish that there was some more complexity in the flavor, it's a little bit like a glorified malt drink, more dessert wine than beer. I also found the body a little watery. It's really hard to believe it's 10%, it's so well blended that it tastes non-alcoholic. 774 charactersnickhiller, May 10, 2011
4.56/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is a review of the bottle I brought home from In De Vrede. I have tasted this beer twice before, both times at In De Vrede, but never outside of Belgium.
A - Pours a 2 finger, creamy tan head. Colour is a dark copper with a brown element, almost black and there is good carbonation coming up the sides. Great creamy head retention with one finger sustaining and a significant amount of soapy lacing. Great head retention and creaminess of it is a bonus.
S - Pit fruits, dates, raisins, lot's of yeast, sugar, boozy fruitcake. Tons of plum and raisin, dark bread.
T - Starts out with alot of yeast. Sugar, slight booze, great rich dark fruit like dates, raisins, plums. Some sort of sugary syrup covered fruit comes to mind or syrupy dessert cake. Once it opens up the fruits become more intense and the yeast element is tamed. There is almost no alcohol. A little bit of spice. Avoids being too sweet as well. Red grapes are present as well. Wonderfully complex and delicious.
M - So insanely smooth. This is my third tasting of this beer and it happens every time. That is one of the things you notice with Westvleteren 12. The fact that it is so incredibly smooth and easy drinking, going down without any sort of sting and almost not wanting to swallow earns lot's of points. You need about half a bottle to realize the ease that you can drink this and yet enjoy it so much and recognize its subtleties. The body is full but not thick, a little creamy, and has medium carbonation.
O/D - I can't see how people consider this the best tasting beer in the world. But it's lovely complexity and texture are world class. It's amazingly drinkable, wonderfully smooth and flavourful. The yeast character at the start is a surpise, but once it opens up it becomes a great, complex beer. It seems alot more yeasty and sugary than other quads...probably due to the amount of candi sugar used. My girlfriend thought it was the best beer she'd ever had. 1,954 charactersbylerteck, May 09, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle from Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam. Lugged around in my suitcase all around europe for the next 3 weeks. I was wondering if it even survived the journey..
A: Pours a dark copper brown, with a good one finger head that just wont seem to go away.
S: Figs, plums, mostly dark fruit and booze.
T: The dark fruit really comes through and creates a wonderful taste. Everything works so well together. Slight boozyness in the finish, but overall very light for such a high abv.
D: great. You can barely taste any alcohol in this beer and you only feel it about half way through when a nice creeping buzz hits you.
O: Love it, which it wasnt so hard to get or damn expensive. 677 charactersDobby, May 09, 2011

A: Color is dark amber brown. Excellent lacing.
S: You can smell hints of plums, figs, and other fruitiness. 
T: Perfect rounded balance of fruit and malt with minimal hoppiness. Hides the alcohol very well.
M: A very tastey beer indeed. I really love this beer it is a good beer. It reminds me more of the Rochefort 8 than the 10. 
D: Easy to drink and would drink another but want to save one for a couple years. 456 charactersjradams76, May 08, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5.33 L bottle at the Tap House in Norfolk back in 2006. Drove down from Philly just to try this one minutes from the home of a good friend.
Chocolate brown with thin creamy head. Whiff of flowers, malts; so gentle. Incredibly balanced taste. A flavor like other Belgians I’ve had but super refined. I can see what the others were striving for. Curiously recognizable but almost as if from a dream. Once you’re immersed the 12 goes down just like water. Buzz creeps in half way through; makes me happy. I think I could drink these continuously for a few days. 
Not the beast I expected but a Shakespearean achievement of fermentation. A keystone of western culture. 669 charactersTheEpeeist, May 05, 2011

Smell is of figs, vanilla, banana nut bread, rum cake, and plum
Taste is malty sweet, candi sugar, rum notes, bready plum flavors, alcohol is very well hidden, nice and chewy. Carbonation is perfect. Some banana and clove with some spicy characteristics. A very complex beer, lots going on here. A real treat wish I could drink this more often. 444 charactersweissbierdrinker, May 04, 2011

A- Pours very deep brown almost black with a thin tan head that leaves some nice bubbles and a faint protective layer. Really wants to lace well. Other samples I've had at In De Vrede usually prodcue large patterns of webby lace on the Westy chalice.
N- Outstanding on the older bottles: loads of rum raisin, malaga gelato, light cognac, dates, figs, mulled apple cider. Whoa. 
T- Similar: tons of gourmet dark fruits, cognac, milk chocolate, ganache, chocolate mousse, mulled red wine. A little warming from the 10%. This is seriously good. 
P- Beautiful creamy, rich palate. Definitely gains mouthfeel and body from the aging.
Definitely one to age for 5+ years. 684 characterstarheels86, May 04, 2011
4.57/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pouring the bottle into the glass was a little whiff of Belgium. The smell was fruity, of cherries, apple, and candied sugar. Around the edges of the smell there's a bit of round hops that have just a bit of bite. It's a fairly strong smell, but mainly sweet, with little bitterness present. Underneath was just a touch of roast, but it's faint.
The beer poured a deep brown color, fairly cloudy, and with quite a bit of sediment in the bottom. There's nearly a finger of yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle, in large white flakes. There's almost no head, just a slight dusting of off-white head. The ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass left a touch of lacing.
The taste was initially of chocolate and fruit, with a good candy sweetness, but still some tartness in the mouth. Towards the back of the tongue, a smooth hop bitterness took over. The malty chocolate flavor sat just in the middle of the tongue. I noticed just a hint of alcohol flavor as well, not nearly enough to indicate the 10.2+% that this beer contained. The flavor was very strong though, absolutely filling the mouth, and leaving a fruity and bitter aftertaste for quite a while.
It's a very full bodied drink, absolutely thick and syrupy. There's quite a bit of carbonation though, much more than I'd expect from such a thick beer. It left a filmy coating on the teeth as well. The beer warmed the throat going down, a much better indicator of how strong it is.
It's definitely a very good drink, and well worth getting your hands on one. I didn't like it quite as much as the 8, but it's probably more a style preference than anything else. I'm not sure exactly how old the bottle was, at least 4 months, and probably older. 1,717 charactersstageseven, May 03, 2011

It poured a dark raisin brown, very cloudy, with a light cream colored head. The head was ultimately smooth and creamy and sat atop the brew in such a delicate manner. It looked exceptional! The aromas consisted of a lot of yeast, bananas, cloves, freshly baked bread, and it had a sweet and dry malty finish. The flavors were very full and consisted of bananas, yeast, freshly baked bread, and some type of nut (hazelnut perhaps). It was simply delicious. It was very full in body and quite thick. It was also exceptionally smooth. Wow, this is hands down the best Quad I've ever had. What an amazing beer. Thanks again Eric! 713 charactersaasher, May 02, 2011

A - Deep ruby-brown body with lots of visible sediment. Then again, I'm drinking the last 1/3 of a bottle that I shared with two others. Head has great retention and by far the best lacing I've ever seen.
S - Smells like a malty red wine with a slight hint of orange. I'm blown away by the scent. 
T - Wow. Honey and oak. Really rich yet still remains incredibly drinkable. The alcohol in this is hidden amazingly. Nice dryness in the finish with an aftertaste that stays for quite a while but is really enjoyable. 
M - Like velvet on the tongue. Very full-bodied but manages to stay light on the tongue as well. 
O - Definitely deserves its high rank. This is a beer you have to experience. I'll be damned if I never get to drink it again.
Wow. 854 charactersloobear, May 02, 2011

Appearance - Dark clear ruby black. cream colored head. With good lacing. 
Smell - Candy. Almost medicinal, but not in a bad way. Just in a weird exotic way. and something delicious I haven't found in any other beer ever. 
Taste - Dark fruit body, honey finish. Hidden alcohol, but still with a delicious sharpness to it. Strange sweetness that I can't identify. like some sort of exotic fruit. Pomegranate maybe?
Mouthfeel - Smooth body. Nice sharpness to it that dissipates and doesn't leave a strong alcoholic breath like other beers might.
Overall - Lived up to the hype. I was hoping i wouldn't be let down and i wasn't. I would call this the best beer in the world for sure. 820 charactersZenAgnostic, May 02, 2011

Sweet malt, raw sugar, toffee and a background of wet grass and hay in the nose. Some liquorice, and warming alcohols in the mix as well.
A medium thick body full of raw cereal, muscovado and candy sugars, molasses and liquorice in the malt. Bitter roasted barley and hops from the boil bring a good hit of dry bitterness in the middle. Finish starts dry and becomes sweeter. A slight alcohol that lingers in the back of the throat is the only real sign of the ABV.
Good medium level carbonation plus the very generous malt body give a good solid chewiness. (I think this is the only area where this beer definitively tops the fantastic Rochefort 10)
I like it. Its my 3rd lash at the 12 and I hope I get another go. 819 charactersTrizzle, Apr 27, 2011
4.1/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I decided to open one of these on Good Friday. The usual suspects were in attendance for a tasting at my place so why not start it off right with a Westy 12.
Poured from a bottle (just shy of a year old) into a small Westy goblet at cellar temperature. This brew appears a clear amber color with ruby and orange tints around the edges of the glass. A cap of fizzy yellowish tan head forms a finger's worth of head that dissolves to a thin lacing across the top of the brew. A light swirl revives the head and produces some spotty lacework on the glass.
The smell of this brew is sweet with dark fruitiness riddled with candy sugar. It smells of plums, raisins, dates and brown sugar. Just collectively a bunch of deep sweet scents whack the nose. A light touch of fruity alcohol is present and a contrasting strong herbal to almost medicinal hoppy bitterness keeps the sweetness of this brew's smell in check.
The taste of this brew is sweet caramelized sugars tasting reminiscent of plums and raisins. There is a light nuttiness to the malt flavoring and a strong booze flavor that is backed by herbal flavors and modest hoppy bitterness. This initially tasted like the sweetness could get out of control but the alcohol and hoppy bitterness keep it balanced. There is a lingering taste of candy left in the mouth coupled with fusel alcohol and a bit of yeastiness that provides a light spiced aspect like clove.
This is a medium bodied brew that has a lively, prickly level of carbonation. A little young, green yeastiness is present throughout the flavor profile. This is more herbal and bitter than I was expecting with hops being more evident than I would prefer but regardless it is balanced well and enjoyable. I couldn't wait any longer to open this brew and finally give it a try. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations, shame on me for opening this too early. Perhaps I will need to acquire a vintage bottle and revisit my review. 1,957 charactersstakem, Apr 27, 2011

Opened 25/04/11
Poured into Red Wine goblet
A: Deep, rich, thick brown with an equally thick, almost viscous creamy foam atop -- reminds me of cappuchino!
S: Roasted barley, faint leather, coffee, ever-so-faint alcohol, damp earth, mineral, biscuit, oak.
T: Very rich -- like candy. A cascade of biscuity malt with the perfect balance of bitterness reminiscent of a good espresso -- oaky, like a barrel-aged stout or even a smooth bourbon. And keeps on going.
M: I want to just keep going with this brew. No stickiness -- perfectly balanced, ideal carbonation.
O: Oh man. Even apart from the mystique, it's art. The mystique is there for good reason! Worth seeking out, and cellar it if you've got strong enough resolve.
I paired it with a Polyface Farms "Fauxo-" buco (adult beef shank), risotto milanese, sugar snap peas, and sour cream biscuits. An excellent pairing, but not perfect -- the beer was actually a bit strong for the food. It could stand a stronger, heartier dish, but it does love the garlic-tomato stewed meat and marrow. 1,085 charactersdrperm, Apr 27, 2011

Overall, this is a textbook quadrupel. It was not, however, markedly better than the neighboring St. Bernardus. I understand that the rarity of this beer may drive up the ratings a bit, and that's understandable, but this is not the best beer, or even quadrupel I have had. It was, however, fantastic, and I highly recommend trying one if you have the opportunity to visit In de Vrede. The pilgrimage is worthwhile. 524 charactersdavidfortunato, Apr 26, 2011

T: Everything you could possibly want in a Belgian quad. Perfect rounded balance of fruit and malt with minimal hoppiness. Can't taste the alcohol at all.
M: Definitely an experience on the same level as the taste. Wet at the beginning with some delightful tingling from the carbonation. Drinking water with this kind of mouthfeel would be a pleasure.

Pours a dark brown, not unlike the color of the bottle it was poured from. Forms at least an inch of tan head which clings to the glass like someone was coming to take it away 
Smells of raisins, grape juice, and caramel. 
The taste is more of the same. I love that grape juice characteristic, which is not unlike Pannepot Old Fisherman's ale. Very pleasant overall.
Finishes smooth. Very carbonated but not overly so. 
Ahhhh, the question that can not be answered: is this the best beer in the world? It is certainly one of the best I've ever had, but I'm fairly new to the ticking scene, so I don't know how I'll ever k ow, unless I get my hands on a case and can compare every year or so to the new beers I've come across. Overall wonderful and one I'm glad to have ticked. 865 charactersCruisaC, Apr 20, 2011

This beer pours deep, ruby-tinted brown with a huge and dense fluffy white head. The nose is malty and complex, with notes of dark dried fruits, cocoa, honey, and faint spiciness. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and the taste is complex with more dark fruit and caramel with almost port-like flavours. Alcohol is present and warming, but not hot despite the ABV of 11%. Probably not the best beer I’ve ever had, but damn good. 576 characters, Apr 20, 2011

I want bore you with the same tasting notes that 1000 others have already beaten me to. I will say that whilst I do prefer the 8, this is still an exceptional beer but it also proves that sometimes more isn't necessarily better.

A-Gorgeous brown body, lots of carbonation and huge tan head. A real pretty beer.
S-Smells very earthy, lots of brown sugar and caramel with a fruitiness to it. Almost a little bit of fig.
T-Grape flavor overwhelms this one. Lots of grape followed by brown sugar and molasses, not quite what I was expecting. It is very sweet and flavorful but also very fruity.
M-Nice carbonation and flavor, quite drinkable.

I have to say this is a very good beer, but i didn't see it as the "holy grail of beers"(no pun intended seeing that this is an abbey beer)
I quite enjoyed this beer, the lacing on the glass signaled the quality and the aroma was great. The taste was as impressive, but i personally have had some better overall belgian beers
I am planning another trip to europe this year so maybe i will get to belgium and who knows, maybe get to the abbey to try the other 2 beers they produce! 586 characterscalcio360jrd, Apr 19, 2011

a - poured a cloudy dark brown into my glass. had a slight head that laced around the glass very well. when held to the light one can see the sediment goodness that comes along with the beer.
s - fruity prevails at first scent, then gives way to a sweet smell of sugar. also apparent to the nose is a yeasty bread scent.
t - at first sip what comes to mind is that all the tastes from this beer is very well balanced. the fruit flavors are not overbearing and gave way to a caramel/brown sugar flavor. the alcohol was not overpowering at all and seemed almost non-apparent. a dangerous notion with this wonderful beer at 10.2% avb.
m - medium in body which is good for a quad. the amount of carbonation was great which made the beer smooth in the mouth.
d - i cannot help but reiterate that i think this is one of the most balanced beers that i have had. which is what makes this beer very good. i feel that i could drink this beer for any occasion and probably put back more than one if they weren't so expensive. this is definitely a beer that everyone should try one in their life. 1,202 charactersnightwing002, Apr 17, 2011

4.45/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter glass from a bottle with a best by date of 07.01.14. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 
Appearance: As poured the beer is a clear medium to dark brown color with a 1” frothy light tan head that leaves little lacing as it recedes. After a while the head any foam are gone except for a thin layer that partially cover the liquid and a ring around the glass that leaves a few patches of lacing when sipping. These soon slide back down to the liquid so no lacing clings to the side of the glass.
Smell: The aromas leave no question that this is a subtle and complex beer. Even though it is quite complex it seems to me there is caramel and chocolate or cocoa here, along with some fruits like raisins and cherries. I’m also picking up a trace of alcohol.
Taste: The flavors are much as predicted from the nose. Again there is no question this is a subtle and complex beer. There are dark fruits here (raisins, cherries) mingled with lightly flavored chocolate or cocoa. Both the sweetness and the bitterness are well controlled here and neither shoves out the other.
Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is full to medium bodied and quite soft and smooth with the gentle carbonation. The finish is medium to long, begins in sweetness from the malt and candi sugar, and then moves through some gentle earthy bitterness (that almost isn’t) before trailing off to dryness. Interestingly the end is noticeable because eventually it feels there should be something there but it isn’t.
Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a very drinkable beer. Each sip follows the last quite naturally and easily. But for the ABV I could sit and sip on this beer all night. I’ll certainly be willing to have another should the opportunity arise. My overall impression is that this is definitely a well made, first rate beer. I don’t know that I’d say it’s the best in the world but it well deserves to be right up there in competition for that honor. 1,990 charactersdrtth, Apr 14, 2011

Well, this a very fine beer...but I've had better. No problem, I give it props.
Pours a light caramel brown, lighter than expected and for the style. Some particles floating around and a 1 finger head. Head pulls down to a collar.
Aroma is caramelized almost-rotten apple, sweet biscuit and plump young raisin. Boozy, too.
Flavors are extremely well balanced, yet nothing sturdy. Orchard fruits, caramel, candied sugar. Boozy on the end. Some spice comes and goes. A bit light with the flavors. Nice finish on it with the fruit and caramel tailing off nicely, and the alcohol giving a pleasant warming.
Overall, a very nice beer. A tad light for the style, and not a "holy poop, this is great" beer. Worth the adventure to secure one...or two 796 charactersMebuzzard, Apr 10, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally the Westy 12. Cracked open on my first anniversary of joining BA. I can remember the time where I thought I'd never get a taste of the number one beer in the world. If I would have had one then, I would have gulped it down without a doubt. Tonight I appreciated it a little more. I didn't know what to expect from this beer as there is a lot riding on being labeled the number one beer in the world. Was expecting a little let down... far from it after finishing it off. Cap reads 26.5.13. Poured into Westvleteren Chalice.
A- Pours very hazy, cloudy brown in color. Off white 1 and 1/2 finger head. Fades down to a thin cap for the remainder of the beer.
S- The nose starts and ends with dark fruits throughout. Very inviting aroma, as it is not to much, but still enough to make you wonder what is about to come. 
T- My first taste leads to a boozy grape, raisin beer. The flavors pour in from here with some sweetness, spices, and dark fruits. Everything is balanced, more than expected. Very smooth drink, makes you want another sip right after you had one. Dark fruits end the drink nicely. Wow, it really is a great beer to drink. 
M- Medium body, lighter on the carbonation. A little crisp, coats the mouth nicely though. 
D- Only my second quad, and this is by far the better of the two. Didn't like my first quad, so I was a little apprehensive of this, but it lived up to expectations as a great beer. Wish I had the opportunity to get a couple and enjoy with more people. 1,495 charactersHosP, Apr 10, 2011

I had the esteemed pleasure of having this beer on my trip to Belgium; first a one year old version at my friend's house in Ghent, then straight out of the bottle at the abbey when I picked up 48 bottles of blond, then a two year old version at my friend's house. While having the two year old, my friend brought out yet another bottle of the one year old so we could compare them. I figured aged beers were for snobby pretentious little bastards, but I was proven wrong upon tasting the difference betwixt the two. Touche. I didn't actually review the version straight from the abbey, but I've included my reviews of both the one year old and the two year old below. (I know I'm a lucky bastard, for the record.) Obviously, both were from the bottle, served into a proper Westy goblet. I tasted the aged versions in Ghent.
A(1yr): Two finger head of amazing cream and thickness. A dark black colour with an amber bottom. Very appealing. Excellent retention. I let the beer sit for a bit so that it would be the correct temperature; it was fetched from a refrigerator. 
A(2yr): Two finger head of lovely cream and thickness. Dark amber colour. 
Sm(1yr): Cream. Very subtle spices and esters. Esters are seemingly dominated by raspberry. Some nutty hops. Exquisitely subtle. Balanced. A light strength scent overall, but then me nose is broken. 
Sm(2yr): Dark fruit. Cream. Hops. Complex. 
T(1yr): Beautiful body of nut, spice, and especially tamed fruit, which bleeds - nay - allows itself into the finish. Perfectly balanced. Fruit hangs on the finish, joined by a symphony of cream. Cream is also present on the open. A perfect injection of bitterness is present just before the climax. 
T(2yr): Dark fruit, hoppy body build. Amazing. Incredibly complex. Balanced perfectly. Built perfectly. Fuck me that's delightful. 
Mf(1yr): Perfectly creamy, smooth, and wet yet dry. Teases an orgasm from the tongue. Amazing. 
Mf(2yr): Silky. Soft and smooth. Amazing. Delicate and incredible. 
Dr(1yr): I would down this repeatedly if given the chance and budget (and I did, at In Da Vrede). If you have a last meal, this ought to be a candidate for the drink. Makes you close your eyes to savour the taste. Believe the hype; this is the best beer I've had so far. The best retention I've ever seen. 
Dr(2yr): Fecking brilliant-like. Hides its ABV absurdly well. 
Note that the numeric review values correspond to the two year.

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Here it is, the legendary Westvleteren 12. I received this in the mail just today. Could barely contain my excitement as I waited for it to chill. It's in the well known unlabeled bottle with a ring of glass that says Trappistenbier. Bottlecap bears the date 24.09.13. Poured into a snifter.
Appearance: Pours a delightful dark hazel color with a cream colored half inch head. Head retains very long and lacing is also long lasting and thick.
Smell: Amazing. A mouthwatering blend of complexity. I pick up dark and dried fruits, cream, toffee, sweet desserts, and not a hint of ethanol. It's clear to my nose that there is much more here than my meager olfactory senses can pick up.
Taste: Perfect. Everything I expected. This style of beer has proven one of my favorites ever since I tried the excellent Rochefort 10, but this beer is the best I've tried so far. All the smells I mentioned in the previous section are present in taste, including the lack of ethanol. The overwhelming complexity keeps you drinking and wondering what other treasures might be found in the depths of this beer.
Mouthfeel: This beer is so smooth. Syrupy in consistency with light carbonation. But not forceful. Goes down very easy. A very drinkable beer.
Overall: This beer is indeed legendary. It's reputation is well deserved. I know this review has thusfar seemed as if I've been kissing Westvleteren's ass due to the hype. But it really is the best beer I've ever tried, and I've just tried to say why. It is such a shame that this beer is so rare. Because it is a real treat. 1,566 charactersJeriacor, Apr 08, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - No label, with a ring around the bottle that says Trappistenbier. The cap has the date 16.06.12 stamped on it. Pouring this into my tulip glass produced 1.5 inches of off-white head that has great retention and leaves some clingy lacing. The beer is clear with a very dark ruby red hue.
S - It has a very pleasant sweet and fruity aroma consisting of prunes, raisins and grapes.
M - Medium in body with perfect carbonation. It has a slight syrupy feel to it that coats the mouth.
T - Upon the first sip dark grapes and prunes dominate the flavor. Next up is a little woodiness before some more dark fruit. I couldn't really detect any alcohol in the flavor, but noticed it a little as it warmed up my chest. It has a good bit of sweetness, but is never sickeningly sweet. It drinks extremely smoothly with no harsh flavors at all.
This is without a doubt a world class beer. I wouldn't have been able to tell you that it contained over 10% alcohol. I want to give a huge thanks to Brabander for sending me 2 bottles and giving me the chance to try this delicious beer. Hopefully I'll be able to try it again next year when I'm in Belgium. 1,146 charactersboralyl, Apr 07, 2011

4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Tasting Date: 3/19/2011
Service/Appearance: Poured into two Duvel glasses to share with my father. Since it was a one bottle split, it obviously didn't come close to filling it, but still poured a deep amber color with a creamy off-white head. Nice lacing as it settled. 
Nose: boozy but a bit fruity at the same time. I got fig, maybe dates, some spice, but pretty subdued. 
Taste: A lesson in quad balance. No over-the-top alcohol here. This is not to say that the alcohol was not apparent, just that it was balanced well by the other flavors - different from a Rochefort 10 in that regard, I think. Complex and delicious. Fruits apparent, some sugary sweetness, balanced out by the yeasty, biscuit-like notes and alcohol.
Mouthfeel: I think this was the weakest aspect of the beer -- though still good, I felt that the feel was a touch thin, though as I've been drinking more stouts recently, it might just be an adaptation bias. 
Overall: Excellent beer. If you like good beer, it's worth trying to find. Even if you're an IPA or Stout drinker, it's an experience worth trying at least once. If you like strong ales, it's very probably top of the heap. 1,161 charactersEldritch, Apr 01, 2011

I said this was the beer I wanted to toast when my daughter was born. Although she was born a little less than 2 days ago, this is my first chance to sit back and enjoy one. This one is for you, Samantha! Welcome to this world...cheers!
A - label-less bottle with a glass ring around the stem of the bottle that says "Trappistenbier" and a cap telling me that this is the Westvleteren 12. Dated 27.05.13. Opened the bottle and poured into my La Trappe chalice. The entire bottle perfectly filled the glass and had a nice brownish purple color with a picture perfect frothy head. The head was creamy and wonderful. As a big fan of Quads, it is wonderful to see that this beer looks perfect.
S - Sweet grapes nutmeg and booze. My mouth is watering. 
T - Oh wow. Just as the nose suggests, this beer is sweet boozy grape juice. I may have opened it a bit too fresh from the fridge because it got much better as it warmed and really came into it's own.
M - Creamy and smooth. The alcohol is HOT on this beer. Tingles like crazy in my mouth and leaves a somewhat bittery yet biscuity after taste. Once I got used to the heat, the flavors and creaminess ruled the roost. Beer felt great.
O - Overall, I am not disappointed one bit. However, I am a bit surprised on the booziness of this beer. Amazing Quad. Best beer in the world...? Maybe. Worldclass...? DEFINITELY. I'd really love to try one that has some solid age on it...I bet it would be insane. I do understand all the comparisons to some of the other better known quads and I do understand some folks choosing other Quads over this one. I'd love to do a blind test next to some of my other favs. 1,748 characterscosmicevan, Mar 27, 2011

I was fortunate enough to find a beer bar in Brussels, Belgium which served bottles of this beer. This was my first time trying this beer. I found it again being served at the Cambrinus restaurant in Brugge, Belgium.
The beer was served almost at room temperature in a chalice. The color was a deep, dark brown. The aroma was of spices, fruit, and a hint of caramel.
The beer was rich and smooth and full of flavor-you could taste the spice, maltiness, and dried fruit.
I drank this beer slowly both due to its richness in flavor and because I wanted to savor this rare beer.
I feel very lucky to have had this beer more than once during my trip to Belgium! 742 charactersChincino, Mar 24, 2011

Murky dark brown body with no head or lacing to speak of. The lowest of the rating tiers for sure.
Aromas of prunes, dates and baking spices. 
Brown sugar, dried fruits and spices. Oak aging is evident. Has a tiny bit of sour funk to it. Pretty sweet overall. The yeast dominates. Quad Heaven!
Silky full body with low carbonation. This is "beer juice". 
No obvious alcohol presence to speak of. Any difficulty you will have drinking this beer would be from the richness of flavor, which is expected, and not the harshness of the alcohol. It's so incredibly smooth for the abv %. The smoothness of this beer is unparalleled. If I could rate this an A++, I would.
Probably one of my favorite beers ever and I'm usually an American hops kinda guy. Trade more of this with me and I'll be your best friend! 927 charactersaficionado, Mar 22, 2011

The beer is a nice deep brown color but not black. You have to take your time with this beer because of the high abv and all the notes that you can pick up in both the nose and the taste. Toffee, caramel, and malty sweetness capture your nose. The taste is a delicious blend of the aromas plus a little warmth from the abv. This beer is a good beer to end the night with because of its high abv plus your palette will be overloaded after drinking this beer. Take your time and savor this great brew.

The aroma is of grape juice and light prune. There are some musty yeast notes that bring an earthy character to the aroma. Some light tobacco notes round out the aroma.
The taste starts off with grape juice and prune flavors as well as some honey and caramel. This is quickly balanced by some stark earthy notes. Some nice tobacco notes bring balance to the flavor profile. There is some ash that actually gives the beer a lightly bitter finish. Some light medicinal characteristics are detected but nothing really stands out, perhaps some clove. A really well rounded flavor profile that has great balance.
Moderate feel with fizzy and airy carbonation that makes the beer feel lighter than it actually is. Very creamy feel. Sweet on the palate but does finish with a light bitterness. Great balance.
Great quad/BSDA. Exactly what I look for in the style. Not overly sweet with raisin and prune flavors but more of an earthy flavor that makes the beer very drinkable. Glad I got 3 more.

The first one I had was poured almost room temperature from the bottle into a matching chalice. Dark brownish/red hue. Dark brooding scents of prunes and other dark fruit.
Taste was absolutely amazing (even warm - which normally I don't care for). I was sold in the first few sips. Tastes of prunes, sweet dark fruit and spices. Very little aftertaste and almost no hint of alcohol at all. Heavier mouthfeel but drinkability was fantastic.
I turned to my wife and said "this is without question the best beer I've ever had". I felt vindicated when I found out later that I was sampling one of the highest rated and most sought after beers in the world. Brought a couple bottles home for my first wedding anniversary and I can't wait to drink them. 954 charactersAZbelgian, Mar 19, 2011

Tons of different flavors dance around, cherries, mollasses, brown sugar, raisins and even a hint of chocolate. Each sip brings all of these and others, all perfectly blended and smooth to sip. No notice of the booze, even as it warms. Mouthfeel is smooth yet still a little crisp, not cloying at all. A beer worth waiting for!! 579 charactersLiverpool08, Mar 19, 2011

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My dear Lord. This beer poured with a perfect, beautiful head that left a lace that was almost better that a woman's. Dark amber brown, with a clarity if poured with the retraction move utilized on most Belgians with internal fermentation. It almost kills me to wait and look, because I know what's next. The flavor is outstanding, dare I say epic. The fact that it pegs the meter in all aspects of beer flavors, while at the same time maintaining a perfect balancing act, is nothing short of awesome. The yeasty flavor coupled with the hard water provide the backbone for the dry and floral flavors that dance with the light malt and hops. It finishes dry and satisfying, and begs you to open another with its tempting warm alcohol in the back of the throat. Please don't hate me for having cases of this beer in my basement when I lived in Belgium. My friend's Belgian wife was very adept at acquiring copious amounts of this platinum liquid. This is my favorite beer in the universe, and has been for over ten years. 1,019 charactersWegomlegging, Mar 13, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5As with anyone who's had the privilege of trying this brew, the effort was painstakingly brutal and the blow to my pocket was high. This is a genuine Trappist Beer made by the Monks in the Trappist Abbey of Saint Sixtus of Westvleteren and shipped to me directly from Belgium. They brew roughly 500,000 cases of beer each year with a mere 160,000 cases of Westvleteren 12. That is an extremely limited production considering it is rated the #1 Beer in the entire world. For this reason, it is almost impossible to find and outrageously expensive. Even in Belgium, the citizens are limited to 1 order per phone number/license plate per month. And although the demand is astronomical, the production is not expected to increase. The Abbey is very much against the resale of their beer and for this reason there is actually a thriving black market for it, with some of the aged ones selling for upwards of 100 USD for an 11.2oz bottle. I won't say how much I paid because some people may be so inclined to call me ridiculous but anyway; I managed to get my hands on six .33cl (11.2oz) bottles, they were shipped to me via Fed-Ex 2nd day air. The bottle has no label, it doesn't need one. It does; however, adorn its infamous Gold Cap and mine has the date stamped: 15/12/13, translated to December 15, 2013. The beers are bottled 3 years before this date which makes it about 1 year and 3 months old, by a QUAD's standard, it is very fresh. And even though this beer is meant to be aged for years, I'm gonna go ahead and crack one open right now! Mr. Westy, we finally meet. I've been expecting you...
Presentation:
11.2oz Bottle that I carefully pried open one notch at a time careful not ruin or hinder the perfect circumference of the Gold cap. Poured into an Affligem 25cl Goblet, I chose a goblet over a tulip so the beer could properly decant in the wide mouth glass. 
Appearance:
Root beer brown that developed into a gradient ninja assassin shadow black hue as the unfiltered sediment from the bottom joined the party. A misty head and frothy lacing that left little to be desired and a final ring that held the volatiles in with a thick beige cloud of radiant sunshine. It's assurance that nothing would be escaping was comfort for the soul. 
Smell:
Belgian Dark Candi syrup nose with a buttered raisin bread inhale - that classic QUAD aroma that you demand from the style. Hints of dried fruit pods, molasses and even a bit of chocolate play a role in this flawless medley.
Mouthfeel:
Medium to full bodied with a perfect ballet of effervescence that finishes supple, creamy then dry. Cloud 9, here I am. 
Drinkability:
EPIC! When you get into QUADS you start noticing things like too much sweetness, overwhelming alcohol, bite from the carbonation, more spice than you need but what makes this brew really sparkle is its ability to equalize everything that you love in the style and balance them harmoniously. It's something I haven't experienced before and I see it as a privilege to do so today. The alcohol takes a back seat; not even the warming is very present. I only noticed that it was a 10.2% when I got up out of my chair and realized that I definitely drank this too fast. But hey, that's what excitement and anticipation does to you, I guess.
Taste:
Luxurious, brilliant and inviting to the palette. What's cool is that the taste differs slightly between a sip and a gulp. On the sip I get a refined succulent smooth silky grape and fig personality. On the gulp it's velvety but punchy surrounded by black cherry malts, dark candi sugar and toffee with a cream soda back end then a tremendously dry frothy finish. What's peculiar is that not a single profile overpowers the other. I think what makes this work and what keeps coming to mind is its incredible balance. Its complexity shines.A couple of sips toward the end it turned a peppery anise and even floral at one point. I really wish this bottle wasn't so expensive because I'd like to re-explore this beer and give it another whirl but alas, my hasty dive has unfortunately found the bottom of my glass and to be honest with you, am a little disheartened that I can't enjoy more of this magnificent brew. Westy 12 tastes incredible fresh, I bet it's even better aged. I'm going to let the other bottles sit in the cool humid darkness for another year and come back to let you know how the flavors marry. 4,387 charactersjayavery, Mar 11, 2011

M/D: This had medium amount of carbonation, which allowed a lot of the subtleties to be appreciated throughout the tasting. A well-balanced and complex beer. I would love to let there be some age on the beer and see what it does. But a fresh one is superb, so I cannot complain 698 characterscpmichael, Mar 07, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Kasteel goblet. Thanks to onedropsoup for this. I think this might be from 2009 due to the dateless cap. 
The first (and only other) time I tried this beer I was at a tasting and had several brews before getting to this one. Boy was that a mistake. I couldn't smell or taste much of anything. Anyway, this time I get to fully enjoy it. 
4.0 A: Pours a ruddy dark brown color. Initially, it poured fairly clear, but toward the end of the bottle, clumpy sediment started accompanying the liquid. Two fingers of mainly frothy beige head with slightly better than average retention and a formitable ring of lacing.
4.5 S: This is quite a complex brew! Surprisingly nutty, this is by far the nuttiest quad I've ever stumbled upon. Dry as well (I suppose that's expected from the candi sugar). Earthy and musty, and toasty like there is lots of brown malt. Only moderately spicy and nothing really stands out in this regard (maybe white pepper). Fig, tobacco, and pear brandy fruitiness. Ovaltine-like chocolate and just a touch of booze. This is very nice, but I'd prefer if it had some more power.
4.5 T: Not as complex as the nose, but much stronger flavors. Foremost there is brown sugar, caramel, tobacco, and molasses. Booze soaked figs, raisins, and prunes. Raw cacoa powder, nutty, and toasty. Peppery and to a lesser extent, clove, spiciness. Again, earthy and musty. Pretty damn good here too.
4.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Carbonation is in perfect amounts with a good spritzy quality to it. Good amount of creaminess and super smooth with a touch of warmth on the finish.
4.5 D: I suppose this does live up to the hype. It's an excellent brew, but I'm not so sure that it's that much better that easier to get examples. Still, quite a brew! 1,773 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 05, 2011

Drinkin it with him right now. Poured a cola/chestnut like apperance with moderate head. Very nice amount of carbonation that gave a very satisfying tang to it. Very delicious beer, prob not number 1 though thats what its title proclaims. Very nice spicy fruity taste that complements the smooth creamy maltiness of it. A very rich package all together. I wouldn't prob pay this much again for the beer, but I am certainly happy I was able to have it finally. 565 charactersjbbjr0387, Mar 05, 2011

A: Slightly lighter in color than I imagined for a quad, almost caramel to brown, with a sort of milky quality from the sediment.
S: Aromas are simply amazing with notes of dates, raisins, licorice, baking spices, dark fruits and fennel.
T: On the palate the flavors were a lot creamier than I expected, almost reminiscent of a barleywine. Notes of caramel, milk chocolate, licorice, cloves, fresh baked wheat bread and rich cinnamon-raisin bread pudding
M: Feel is soft and silky, about as elegant a mouthfeel as I can remember.
D: Drinkability was first class, perfectly balanced, which doesn't strike me as earth shattering, cause lets face it if your 10% ABV quad is overly boozy your probably doing it wrong.
Over all an incredible beer that I was glad to finally try. Can't say I'd climb any mountains to get this again, but I certainly wouldn't say no if one happened to fall in my lap again. 975 charactersnbree00, Mar 01, 2011
3.7/5  rDev -19.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Bottle as part of Westy Wednesday at Volo, served in a flute. Anticipation is huge with this one, peensteen and I were drooling waiting to sample this one. Been waiting to get my lips on this one for a while. 
Poured a deep dark maroon, with some burgundy and deep blood red highlights at times. Great lace and creamy, dense head. Nose is of rich dark fruits, figs, rich plums, brown sugar and a vanilla. A sense of some subdued alcohol notes, rich and very pleasant overall. Taste is a cascade of raisin, plum and figs on the tongue, less brown sugar than the nose, some vanilla, light spicing. Long dry finish, and fairly dry throughout. Lingering mouthfeel with some warming alcohol. Begs for sip after sip, this was just fantastic. Best quad I've come across thusfar, absolutely delicious and worth every bit of hype. 5/45/5/5/45
Re-reviewed as this was shared among a variety of other quads as part of the QuadShowdown - amazingly, out of 13 quads, we ranked this the absolute lowest. 2010 vintage. Poured a dark brown, with a dark cream coloured head. Great retention and a bit of lace. Nose is really grape-y, sweet with a lot of Welch's grape juiciness. Some sugary notes and a bit of vanilla. Taste reflects the nose, more grape and Welch's, some balance but there's just a great amount of grape juice here. Some caramel, darker fruits and sugar, but not alot of complexity. Medium-medium heavy mouthfeel with a bit of creaminess, with some lingering saccharine and grape notes. Modest, but feels too young. 4/4/35/4/35 1,530 charactersliamt07, Feb 27, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.53 year old bottle.
A-Hazy deep brown with little particles of yeast and a head that leaves beautiful rings of lacing as it dissipates.
S-Fig jam, bread pudding, fruit cake, cinnamon, earthy sweetness.
T/M-Very lush mouthfeel. Palate is coated with mature fruit flavors, almost reminiscent of a vintage barleywine. The finish is defined by a delicate hoppiness that keeps this from getting too sweet.
D-Is it better than the Rochefort 10? I don't think so. Still, this is fantastic stuff, perfect for a special occasion. 523 charactersDaveHS, Feb 27, 2011
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5What is there still to say about this beer that was not said before. Maybe that fresh, this beer is not supposed to be #1 in the world (rochefort 10 and sint bernardus abt are superior fresh), at least to my opinion. With a little bit of age however, this beer becomes by far the best quad in the world! So, if you get your hands on a bottle, be patient and store it for at least one year.

4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Backstory: Purchased Sept. '10 consumed Feb. '11 in a Westmalle chalice at about 20 degrees Celcius. 
A - thick thick beige head looks memory space foam. So thick it looks like it has resistance. Surface tension high. First beer I've had where the lacing went up the glass not down. Color is cherry mahogany. Slight carbonation on sides. Cloudy about like melted butter. 
S - stone fruit figs dates. Blackberries. Rasberry. Cranberry. Cotton candy. It changes then changes again. 
T - each sip has a slightly different taste. It changes fast. Strayberry. Citrus. Red wine. Rye bread. Sourdough. Peaches. Aftertaste is slightly fusil burn alcohol and sour wine yeast. Very fruity not light sweet corn sugar but deep and concentrated like grape peels. 
M - slightly drying but smooth silky and velvet like rubbing the inside of my mouth with rabbit fur. 
D - this is beer you drink with your eyes closed. You want to experience it slowly and methodically. 958 charactersjeranbrews, Feb 26, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 524.09.11 stamped on the cap. I think that means bottled in 08 but I'm not sure.
Pours a very dark chestnut brown/plum color with slight murky cooper brown edges and a one finger frothy beige head that slowly fades into a thin lasting cap. Sporadic spots of lace left behind.
Spicy, estery aroma with lots of vinous dark fruit, zesty pepper and earthy hops. Very complex nose with lots of plum, grape, raisin, fig, date and dark cherry. This is complimented by a nice roasted malt presence with hints of chocolate and caramel and subtle earthy pine. Peppery with coriander and cardamom as well as hints of yeast/bread, phenol and licorice. This beer smells exceptional.
Medium bodied with a perfect balance of sweet, vinous dark fruit, eatery yeast, zesty spice, earthy hops, roasted malt and sweet alcohol. Soft carbonation up front with a heavy spice profile. Lots of zesty pepper and coriander that lingers throughout over the complex body into a sweet yet dry finish. This is quickly countered by a delicious dark fruit presence with hints of plum, grape, dark cherry, fig and raisin. The sweetness from the yeast is complimented perfectly by a prominent malt character. Fuller bodied than other beers in the style with a slightly roasted character giving off hints of chocolate, toffee and caramel. In addition to all of these flavors, there is a subtle earthy hop presence that adds more depth, balance and complexity. It's not overpowering, providing just enough bitterness to balance things out a bit. Toward the end of the swallow there is some sweet alcohol phenols and subtle heat but the ABV is excellently masked with little to no warmth in the finish. This beer is dangerously drinkable at 10.2%. 
Overall, this beer incredibly complex, delicious and extremely quaffable. The best example of the style that I've tried and one of the best beers I've ever drank. 1,877 characterscorby112, Feb 23, 2011
4.55/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Hayesez for this one. I've been holding onto this one for over a year now and finally found a reason to open it... Celebrating a wonderful weekend with my new beautiful fiance. 
Poured from a bottle which I have no idea how to tell the date on, into a chalice.
A: A deep mohagony with about a half inch of a foamy light brownish head. 
S: Lots of dark fruits. Raisons, prunes, figs, maybe a touch of brown sugar and a hint of caramel. Wonderful especially from a style that isn't my favorite. 
T: Sweat dark fruits show up once again, this one goes right along with the smell which is nice. There is only the slightest trace of the 10% abv. Very complex and by far the best belgian I have ever had. 
M: Full bodied and creamy. 
D: I could drink many more of these... well maybe if i lived there.
Not my favorite style, and definately not my favorite beer, but this is by far my favorite beer of this style. 923 charactersBS68280, Feb 22, 2011

Poured into a Westvleteren chalice. 21.05.11 stamped on the cap.
A: A deep red mohogany colour. A very tan head with tight bubbles. A lot of sediment in this particular bottle.
S: Raisins, dates, dark cherries, honey, malty goodness accented with vanilla. I cannot stop sticking my nose in the glass.
T: The dark fruits, sweetness of the malts and a fantastic spice. Caramel, caramelized brown sugar and a hint of vanilla are next followed by the alcohol in a very subtle way. So complex and delicious.
M: Very smooth and creamy. The warming sensation from the alcohol is amazing.

27.05.10 is stamped on the bottle cap.
Deep red almost purple in color. Lovely foam retention. At least an inch of tan head. Beautiful lacing along the chalice.
Plenty of spice, figs, prunes, raisins, some herbal tea notes and mild bready notes.
Whoa! This is so smooth up front with a ton of carbonation. Huge amounts of prune and fig with a nice earthy yet spicy bite of hops. Toffee and honey come through with the sweetness of dark belgian candied sugars. Some currants and raisins litter the palate. The depth of esters and malt characters is unparelleled. Superb.
There is a general warming overall but the alcohol is so well hidden it really is a work of art. Little to no phenolic aftertastes. Just a great amount of balance in the beer. Wonderful! 846 charactersstewart124, Feb 21, 2011
4.78/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz poured into an Orval chalice.
A- Creamy, abundant, lacey head that has a hint of a brownish hue to it. Dark as night and can see some carbonation at the bottom if seen with light shone through it. This thing laces a glass like a 2 coat paint job. 
S- Malty bread aromas mixed with a spicy hint aside yeasty estery aromas, dark fruits, and caramel.
T- Malty, with biting spiciness that opens into a complex array of caramel, white raisin, anise, clove and hints of brandy, listed in no particular order or relation. Very phenolic, but well masked, albeit hot. Has an herbal quality in the aftertaste accompanied by a lemon like bitterness that lingers in the mouth. The yeast dances around is present no matter what you focus in on, sweetly punctuating every sip.
M- Full, creamy but carbonated in a way that it breaks on your tongue like a way and dissolve into it. It leaves the mouth watering for more.
D- Wonderfully drinkable, but a serious brew. Very strong and dominating. 
O- Second time I've had this, first time I had a whole bottle to myself. Hype has been lived up to and exceeded two times now. This is the real deal. Do what you can to get this. 1,172 charactersDPFRD, Feb 18, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cap date is 15.12.12 (about 1 year 2 months).
A: Dark cloudy amber with a tight bubbly thick tan head that quickly subsides to a minimal head. Some sediment floating about.
S: Candi sugar, dates, brown sugar...as it warms slight cherry and alcohol appear.
T: Starts creamy caramelized brown sugar covered dates, transitions to a slight alcohol astringency, slight yeast and a hint of chocolate. A candi sugar/brown sugar sweet taste lingers. Very complex to the point where I don't do it justice in my description.
M: Creamy, perfectly carbonated. First Westy 12 so Im not sure what the year has done to the carbonation.
D: Very drinkable. Alcohol is well hidden but enough is there to remind you that you are drinking an alcoholic beverage. 
I have read many times that Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt 12 are good substitutions for Westy 12. I have had both on multiple occasions and could not disagree more. There is no substitute for this beer! May have found a new favorite beer. 992 charactersJpwv, Feb 18, 2011

A: Pours chestnut, a large khaki head quickly develops. 
S: The aroma good yet not incredibly complex. Hearty bread, and a ton of "dark fruit". Im going to call it raisin bread....Also getting hints of candi sugar, yeasty under tones, and a touch of alcohol. Dark, yet sweet.
T: Dark fruit is the biggest player here by far. Dark cherry, figs, raisin are all well pronounced. Candi sugar and spice really shows in the finish, pleasantly sweet. Tons of flavor here, yet somehow so delicate. Theres lots to discover as the glass warms. 
M: Bubbly, medium all around. Expressive, silky smooth.
D: Alcohol heat is barely discernible except in some pleasant warming. This is something to savor yet nothing about this beer would stop me from sucking it down if I wanted to. All things considered, drinkability is great. 
Masterfully crafted, oh and uh...better than Rochefort 10! 930 characterszoolzoo, Feb 17, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours dark mahogany with vibrant ruby red tones showing in the light, tight sticky white head and nice lace showing along the glass. Smells of subtle alcohol, fig, brown sugar, yeast, plum, raisin, cherry, faint leathery notes, dark fruit. Nose is stunning on this one. Tastes of yeast, dark fruit, alcohol, toffee, vanilla, fig, plum, raisin, dark sugar and something almost oak like that are behind the vanilla notes. Every sip of this opens up something new or complimentary. Medium to full mouthfeel that is smooth as silk with a delicate, light carbonation. Dangerously drinkable, ABV is hidden well and its so very tasty and flavorful. Does it live up to it's hype? it certainly comes close. Maybe the best I've ever had and absolutely in my top 3.

It pours a cloudy brown, with a huge, thick, dark beige head.
What a nose! Crazy complexity, figs, dates, estery yeast hinting every stone fruit, some light spice, myriad underflavors beyond me to describe, but with their presence a superb perfume is created.
Perfectly blended flavor, superior to any quad I've tried. Think of all the best flavors of Rochefort 10 and ST. B's ABT 12, soften them a bit, add the most delicious yeast in the world, and you have this. Stupidly delicious and complex I won't even try to dissect. The finest tasting beer ever.
Mouthfeel, judging as the ability of a beer's feel to highlight it's taste, is perfect.
Drinkability is beyond mere numerical representation. Had I enough, I unstoppably would drink this until algae evolved to be the most intelligent living things on the planet.
Impression: The finest beer I've tasted. Hope to taste a better. Doubt I will. Doubt there is one. 1,029 characterscavedave, Feb 17, 2011

A- Murky dark brown with a nice creamy off-white head that looks silky and has pretty nice retention. Certainly some nice spots of lace and a bubbly cloud atop the ale.
S- Lots of bread, very nice and freshly baked bread. A good amount of dark fruit, general spice feel, raisin and some darker brown sugar toast malt, nutty hints.
T- Dark fruit, raisin and fresh bread come off as the biggest thing to me. Underlying notes of nutty malt, brown sugar, citrus zest?, toasty brown malt, slight roast, vanilla and even oak add complexity. The dark fruit is less medicinal than some other strong Belgian ales.
MF- Quad body, lighter overall feel but a strong beer nonetheless. Very little warmth, impressive for 10%. Somewhat creamy with carbonation at a level that suits the flavors.
DB- The fresh bread and yeast profile here surely make this one a treat. At 10%, the ABV is a ghost and this one drinks dangerously smoothly. I could easily throwback a few bottles of this a week if it were available to me. Complex but balanced. 1,122 characterscbutova, Feb 14, 2011

Pours dark brown with red highlights, off-white head turns to film and thick ring which retains perfectly. Some lacing left. Sediment settled at the bottom.
Pretty awesome scent. Super fresh baked bread, raisins, caramel, cherries.
Follows the nose pretty closely...warm dark bread I think being the stand out, brown sugar, figs, cherry pie, nutty malts. Explodes with flavor, yet remains subtle...
Mouthfeel and drinkability to me are the true highlights of this beer. 10.2%, uh whaaa? Not even really a hint of that present. Light, extremely smooth and a bit too drinkable. Even as it warmed to about room temperature, this only improved. 828 charactersChico1985, Feb 10, 2011

taste has a good amount of candi sugar with some nice rich fruits a bit of bread and some burn to it. There is a bit of vanilla in here as well. This would really improve with some aging and I can clearly see the potential.

Thanks to Sweemzander for this treat.
A- Pours a chocolate brown with a huge head, three fingers and some sticking out of the top of the tulip. The head takes forever to die down and leaves great lacing on the side of the glass.
S- Some nice notes of milk chocolate, and dark fruits such as dates and fig. There is also just a hint of sweetness and no alcohol whatsoever.
T- This beer does not disappoint. Some nice chocolate notes to go along with some malt and some dates and currants. There is a creaminess that adds to the flavor.
M- Full bodied that coats the mouth. For as big as the head is, the carbonation isn't very apparent. Just a little heat on the back of the throat from the alcohol.
D- I could sip on this beer all night long. Great flavors and great mouthfeel make this a winner. I will be seeking this out for future Green Bay Packer Super Bowl celebrations. 922 charactersWisconsinality, Feb 08, 2011

A: Pours a dark brown with amber hues, especially when held to light. Small tan head that dissipates slowly, leaving decent lacing.
S: A plethora of dark fruit are dominate ... especially plum, fig and cherries. Yeasty with sweet carmel and syrup. No booze in the nose at all. Very, very nice. 
T: Much like the aroma, the taste is dominated by dark fruit. Sweet, but not overly sweet. Toffee and maple syrup perfectly meld with the fruit and yeast to create something truly special. Just a bit of alcohol on the back end, but certainly not what you'd expect for a 10.20% quad.
M: Medium body and medium carbonation with fine bubbles, creating a smooth, silky presence on the palate. Warming alcohol and just a bit drying. 
I really enjoyed this, and would highly recommend it. Thanks again to Urbancaver for his generosity. 1,006 charactersMississipping, Feb 07, 2011

A: Medium dark brown with heavy ruby red accent. The head is tan in color and is about ½ finger. The head faded quicker than I expected, but left some lacing and a swirl of bubbles and crown that remained for the duration of the drink.
S: My initial reaction was that this smelled a lot like plums. There's also some light caramel, and grapes/champagne. Finally I get a bit of alcohol. This is a very layered and interested smelling beer. 
T: The flavor is deep and complex with a lot of dark fruits up front, primarily raisins and plums, followed by some dry bitterness and a little alcohol heat. The flavor is a little sweet but is nicely balanced and quite a bit different than the smell would indicate.
M: This has a fairly light mouthfeel, but a nice level of carbonation. The aftertaste is great and the beer is crisp. The viscosity is medium of the road and what I would expect. Overall this may be the weakest part of this otherwise outstanding beer.
D: If I lived in Belgium, I would drink this every night of the week. It is truly amazing. Only if... 1,088 charactersglazeman, Feb 05, 2011

Pours a dark brown with slight maroon hues. Fairly large antique white head recedes at a moderate pace. A decent amount of lacing left clinging to the glass.
The aroma is rather herbal and sweet. Brown sugar and dates. I am not getting the depth with the dark fruit that I hoped for. The herbal and spicy aroma are coming through much more clearly than the sweeter scents.
Deeply caramelized sugars and raisins come sweep across the front of the palate. Strong yeast characteristics, cloves and anise, appear mid palate. Medicinal flavor is a bit to pronounced, not a fan of the phenols here. Earthy hops flavor is subtle.
Medium bodied, carbonation is moderate and appropriate. Finish is clean but moderately long. The residual flavor does cling to the tongue a bit.
Maybe my expectations were too high, maybe my palate was not feeling it, I am just not finding what makes this the worlds best beer. Pleasant to drink, I am not sure I want more than one in a sitting. Good beer, worth trying atleast once in your lifetime. 1,134 characterskzoobrew, Feb 04, 2011

This is my second Westy 12 and although it's a very good beer it doesn't strike me as a world class contender. Very good but not worthy of all the hype. I was also surprised on the level of oxidation. 557 characterswisrarebeer, Feb 02, 2011

Poured slightly chilled into a chalice with a hazy opaque brown body. Hazelnut color with lighter tobacco like hues around the edges, fluffy tall white head with nice retention. Smells like figs and fine cognac. Bready and caramel sweet odors in the nose, too. Taste is raisin and fig with brown sugar and slight booze. Sweet and caramel, malts are very pronounced with a slight floral background. Very clean and smooth, booze is not very apparent in taste or feel. Silky character to the body with low to moderate carbonation. This beer was extremely complex and balanced, rich and luxurious, and just downright delicious. I can see why this is touted as the best beer in the world, I hope that I get the chance to try this again and maybe get a few bottles to age. 818 characterskbanks13, Jan 30, 2011
3.95/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2 |  overall: 4A - Deep, reddish amber with a finger silky smooth tan head. The lacing is impressive - when you til tthe glass, the bubbles all fall together, then break. Nice eye candy.
S - Tart cherries, sweet raisin, rum raisin, fresh baked bread, nuts, slight cardboard oxidation. It all finishes with an unusual slightly tart lemon aroma. 
T - Caramel, loads of molasses, hints of raisin, plum, dates and cinnamon. Quite bready and nutty, this tastes very hearty. I'm impressed that the hop profile is so apparent: slightly acidic and tart lemon, grass and orange flavors are found near the finish. Also adding a dryness I was not expecting or enjoying for that matter. 
M - Syrupy, mouth coating body with an obnoxious amount of carbonation. Carbonation is prickly and really too much as I feel like I can't taste everything because of it. it does get better the more you let it warm and let the carbonation die down.
D - I am stunned that this is 10+%abv, it drinks wonderfully with zero alcohol heat. The dryness in the finish is my only drinkability related criticism. Lots of nuance and complexity, solid beer. 1,109 charactersdrewba, Jan 29, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5.33cl, bottled in September 2010.
Rich mahogany color, copious off-tan creamy head-- really a beautiful appearance, though with lots of yeast sediment on the final pour. Very nice lacing.
Aroma is interesting though subtle, with some grape fruitiness, toasted malts and buttery caramel. Booze is there as well. 
Easily one of the most complex ales I've ever tasted. Initially sweet, with candied and brown sugars. Then a pretty strong bitterness is revealed, and the finish is remarkably dry for the style. Seductive and complex dark fruit. The aftertaste is roasty and chocolatey. After a few sips, a pleasant warming effect sets in. As the beer warms, a yeasty-spicy character becomes apparent, adding to the depth of this amazing ale. The mouthfeel is very effervescent, coating the tongue in full, smooth and creamy layers. Although it's very strong, it's very drinkable, with a decently disguised alcohol.
This beer deserves its status as one of the best. THE best? Who knows. Westy 12 is a dry, balanced Quad, and this is what makes it a beautiful beer. 1,063 charactersdasenebler, Jan 29, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours an intense shade of brown with a light tan head.
S: So complex. Brown sugar is prominent. There are dark fruits, but they don't assault the nose like super malty beers that use a ton of specialty grains known to create those flavors (special B, etc). There is a caramel softness to it, which lends the perfect amount of sweetness.
T: Follows the nose. More complexity. Layers upon layers of interesting flavors. Brown sugar, dates, caramel, Belgian yeast phenols.
M: Light on the carbonation. 
D: Westy 12 and Hair of the Dog Adam are the two most complex and interesting beers I have ever had. There is a refined elegance to everything about this beer, from the packaging, to the aroma and taste. 710 charactersgameface23, Jan 28, 2011

Bottle Date: 15.12.11 (approx 2 years old, would turn three this december). 
Tasted on christmas day in what i called "battle of the quads." Was compared to Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus Abt 12.
Poured into a Duvel Tulip.
Well Westy, we finally met. It was a excellent christmas day beer. 
A: Fairly dark brown, lighter then a stout, but darker then your usual brown ale. Pretty sexy looking if you ask me. Poured about two inches of creamy off white head and left tons of lacing. 
S: If you are a fan of Quads, it really can't get any better than this. Dark fruits are just coming out of the wood work with this beer. You name it - Plums, figs, dates, raisons and maybe some cherry. Semi-sweet on the nose, some carmel notes present as well as of course, some belgian yeast i have grown to love. 
T: WOW, what a beer. One of the beers that really puts you back in your seat and takes you for a ride. Going along with the smell in perfect harmony, dark fruits are present along with a sweet belgian brown sugar after taste. Just wonderful. 
M: Heaven on the tongue. Perfect amount of carbonation, very well balanced beer. Very tasty! Alcohol so well hidden its barely there. 
O: Overall, this beer is INSANELY good. I just wish it was more available to get, but oh well. I would recommend that any who likes belgian beers, especially Quads and Strong Dark Ales, this is a MUST try. 1,420 charactersCaptainTripps, Jan 27, 2011

Aroma is wildly delicious - sweet figs in honey, toffee, an immediately noticeable vinous presence, rum sugars, candied dates. A rich, fresh maple syrup is announced. Pour is deep chestnut brown with a small, cobwebby beige head. A highly-anticipated first sip. This has the round, chewy malt of St. Bernardus 12, but has a richer fruit presence and is more refined. Creamy, wonderful mouthfeel. Just beautifully balanced and well-crafted. As with Rochefort, an impression of overripe banana makes itself known. This is fucking amazing. A brilliant spicy note, like cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom swirl about the dark fruits and rich, deep alcoholic sugars. I don't know if I''ve ever enjoyed a bottle of beer this much. If my tooth wasn't hurting I probably would have enjoyed it even more. 803 charactersJAXSON, Jan 27, 2011

The much sought after Westvleteren 12 - 6 pack finally arrived after weeks of pursuit. Refrigererated to only 12 degrees C per Saint Sixtus' website. 
Appearance - Pours a beautiful mahogany brown with just the slightest head.
Smell - Smells of caramalized sugar and dark fruits. Some spices too. You know this will be something special.
Taste - Candy sugar and cocoa; Hop bitter palate. Dark fruits evident. WOW ! Considering this is a 10.2% you would not know it incredibly smooth. Rochefort 10 is great but heavy alcohol taste evident. This beer is very complex but tastes excellent.
Mouthfeel - Carbonation slight, not overbearing. Almost creamy/frothy.
Drinkability - What can I say. For a 10.2%abv this has got to be hands down the most drinkable quad I have ever had. PERIOD ! So smooth.
Overall - This is a great beer. Worth the painstaking time, effort and money to get it over here ?? Probably not. I would never turn this beer down, but thank god for Rochefort and St. Bernardus which are here and a lot cheaper. 
All beer connoisseurs must at least try the #1 rated beer in the world. Excellent ! 1,185 charactersCraigKodish, Jan 26, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5200th review.
11.2oz bottle served in a snifter glass. best before bottle date 13.08.11
pours an opaque mahogany tone with a solid finger of lush, creamy head... slowly fades to a thin cap, collar around the glass; decent lacing. good dose of sediment.
nose is headlined by dark fruits, with notes of spice, brown sugar and caramel malts; definitely a sweet aroma. very nice. slight but perceivable presence of booze.
flavor follows the nose. again, dark fruits - raisin, plum, cherry; brown, maybe carmelized sugar; belgian yeast... very balanced, very complex. also happens to be quite delicious. some warming alcohol in the finish.
medium bodied with adequate carbonation. insanely drinkable, i could happily drink this all day. 
worthy to note that there was no eureka moment upon first sipping it, but as you drink, the brew really opens up. hands down a world class beer, but THE best? hmm... not sure i could give any beer that distinction. were rochefort 10 as difficult to come by i think it would marshall a similar hype. that said, it's easily a top 5 candidate in my book. 1,090 charactersperrymarcus, Jan 25, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5a- pours a rich deep brown with lighter highlights, a sand colored head that fades to a slight rim. 
s- heavy on the candi sugar and caramel, a hint of spice and raisin, slight prune smell too.
t- again big sweet malts, caramel and toffee, picking up a surprising hop taste too, adds some nice bitterness, finishes with classic belgian yeast spice and some orange zest.
m- just the right level of carbonation, feels almost a bit creamy
d- for a quad, feels very light and sessionable. 10+% begs to differ...
will be doing a side by side with rochefort 10 later this week to determine which I like better, right now it's pretty up in the air. i would have liked more of an emphasis on the dark fruits in the taste, but the presence of other nice flavors certainly makes up. 777 charactersDrewZ926, Jan 18, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Acquired from beerinvest.eu (De Struise shop) on 4/29/2010, consumed 1/17/2011. Best before date on cap is "24.03.13" Served in a Bruery tulip.
Appearance - Opaque brown - lighter than a stout. 1cm head, subsiding slowly to consistent lacing. 
Smell - light alcohol, raisins, caramelized sugar (but not as heavy a caramelized sugar as Westy 8). Warm and inviting. Light spicing - perhaps anise?
Taste - some roasted malts. I'm usually not a big fan of quads -they're usually overwhelmingly cloying. But it seems to have a nice balance of noble hops. Slight orange peel flavor.
Mouthfeel - nice carbonation - helps bring out the flavor. Not sickly sweet, but thick. 
Drinkability - much like Westy 8, I'm picking up new things on each sip. I wish I could keep picking up this beer and figuring it out. 
I figured the "best beer in the world" would be more mind blowing - but this is more cerebral. It doesn't stand out in any one way, but it seems a great exercise in balance. Don't get me wrong, it's strong, but restrained. 1,030 charactersmlaroche, Jan 18, 2011
4.55/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Cap dated "16.02.13." Thanks for the chance to try this elusive beer, D13Logan.
Appearance:
Pours a dark mahogany brown with ~1-1.5 inches of an off-white head that lasts for a few minutes. Perfect carbonation levels. 
Smell:
It smells beautiful. Smells of dark fruits - plums, raisins, cherries. Only a hint of alcohol and a faint caramel smell. As it warms, the cherry fruit really comes out.
Taste/Mouthfeel: 
The taste is rich and creamy. Lots of dark Belgian malts. The fruits shine and have a sweet and slightly sugary taste. This beer definitely needs to be drank at the correct temperature as you'll miss much of what the beer has to offer if it's too cold. Long lasting dark finish with brown sugar notes and a slight bitterness. It drinks like a 6-7% beer, not a 10% ABV beer - only a small alcohol burn. 
Drinkability:
This beer is almost scary drinkable as it goes down so easy with almost zero hint of alcohol. In my opinion, the Westy 12 deserves every bit of hype that it gets. 996 characterskevinv, Jan 17, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I'm very lucky/thankful to have a chance to try this beer. Pours a deep brown with an inch of foamy off-white head on top. This beer is not black but you can't see anything through the glass. Lots of lacing on the sides of my glass as I lift it to drink. I love the smell of the Belgian yeast in this beer, it smells like a really sweet apple cider. Lots going on with the flavor of this beer but I taste lots of sugary apple flavored yeast. There are also some slight hints of dark fruit and a nutty finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but with a "lively" feeling of carbonation. There is hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. Everything about this beer was great, and with the exception of the mouthfeel I hardly noticed any of the alcohol presence. I would drink this again or consecutively if it were readily available. 823 charactersSiepJones, Jan 15, 2011

It was just the right blend of strong, but not alcoholly or overwhelming flavour where oh so many other hoity toity Belgian beers have let me down.
Only place I was let down was mouthfeel. I've come to enjoy carbonation, and was slightly disappointed. To each their own. 421 charactersButtWizzard, Jan 12, 2011

This beer is quite beautiful when held up to the light, deep, dark red with sparkling clarity. Two fingers of pancake batter head forms and slowly recedes, leaving chunks of lacing behind...
Sweet and sugary in the nose. Dark fruits and caramel malt. Belgian yeast spice, surprisingly muted aromas overall...
Ripe dark fruits provide some sweetness on first sip. Quickly becomes yeasty, Belgian spice and a lot of caramel malt. A bit of alcohol heat in the finish with a lingering spice and dark, burnt sugar...
Full bodied, creamy and very smooth. Has a certain lightness to it, soft. Alcohol heat shows up and lingers long past the finish... 717 charactershawks10, Jan 12, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 510% ABV. Tasted on self-proclaimed "Westy day" 01/06/11 with my craft beer aficionado buddy. This quad made of perfection was bottled in 2010 (with date stamped 15.10.13 on cap) and given the title "Baby Westy" by us because of its perfection from birth. Currently, ranked the world's best beer gave off an opaque brown/copper appearance. As you drink it, you see many different layers of color - multi-layered complex. Smell hints of Belgium candy sugar. Mouthability and drinkability gave off a smooth and perfect balance. I could taste caramel, raisins, licorice, figs, maybe hint of orange peels, and candied sugar. Additional notes: A beer beyond measure and perfection. Now we can fully measure taste of all beers going forward now that we've had a Westy 12. By drinking the Westy 12, I wouldn't mind joining the St. Sixtus monastery. Humbling experience. Me: I feel buzzed already, Friend: No, its probably the euphoria of drinking this beer. This is a heavenly task that I would totally kill someone if he drank it down in one big gulp. The Westy 12 is indeed the "Holy Grail of Beers"! 1,094 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 11, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -5.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4March 2010 bottle into a snifter. Tasted as part of a comparison tasting between it, Rochefort 10, and St. Bernardus Abt 12.
A - Pours a nearly opaque, cloudy brown, with a huge three fingers of head that fills the remainder of the glass. Great retention and lacing. By far the best looking of the three. 
S - The requisite dark fruit, with fig seeming to be the dominant one. Candied sugar, and a slight spiciness in the background. Nice for the style but not necessarily superior to its competitors. 
T - As expected, it's very, very nice. Not as sweet as the nose would indicate, but there's plenty of that candied sugar leading off. Some yeastiness follows, along with the dark fruit. Raisins and figs, maybe a bit of molasses, and caramel. At colder temperatures it wasn't our favorite, but as it warmed it took over the competition.
M - Definitely softer and rounder than the others. It has a velvety feel that the others can't match. Excellent.
D - While the flavors and feel are definitely great, like most quads it suffers from the high abv. That being said, I wish I had another to open.
O - Great beer, but not the world-changer that the hype makes it out to be. There are just too many easily-obtainable beers in this category that are close to it in quality for me to work this hard for another one. 1,318 charactersdjmichaelk, Jan 04, 2011
4.57/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Much to my delight, the Holiest beer on planet earth arrived three days prior to Christmas. Two bottles were purchased online--one for me and one for a beer loving homie. 
On to the review...
Appearance: Dark earthy tone resembling very fertile soil with a nice bleached leather colored head. Lacing immediate and intricate. Tiny bubbles of carbonation bouncing and popping. 
Smell: Fruity. Raisins. Plums. Pumpkin. Dates. Dried bananas. Malty. Molasses. Earth. Reminiscent of a thick autumn fog on a pumpkin farm. Lots of stuff going on.
Taste: Malty goodness giving way to a break of fruity sweetness and ending with a nice tinge of alcohol that only serves to cleanse the palate for another swig. It tastes just as it smells. 
Mouthfeel: Not heavy. Not light. It dances and skips along with the tastes. The carbonation is perfect. It's a ballerina.
Drinkability: Well, at 10% you can't hang with more than a couple and still appreciate them, but damn I would love to try. 
While drinking this I asked myself the same questions I asked myself before I decided to marry my wife... I made it about beer instead of a woman though because it would be weird if I didn't. 
Is it the best and if I were to consume this one beer for the rest of my life would I still have eyes for other brews?
-Well, if I lived next to the brewery, or even within 200 miles, this might be the best beer ever.... But I don't, so it isn't. If I did live that close, I can't honestly say that a Saison, Strong Pale or Dark, or a really nice Triple wouldn't tempt me to stray (Really, Belgium has all the super model beers). However, this is by far the best Quad I have ever had and would love to drink it again someday. 1,702 charactersGoNowhere, Jan 04, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +2.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Review #100!
11.2oz bottle poured into a Westvleteren chalice.
Huge thanks to some great BAs for this.
After a rat race to get this beer (asked a girl I had class with if she had any family in Belgium, who then got me in contact with her uncle in Holland, who met a contact I met through BA to pick up the beer, who then delivered the beer to her grandma who traveled in this winter for her graduation, who then gave it to the girl, who gave it to a friend of mine from college who finally gave it to me), I finally received 8 bottles from this abbey after two bottles and a chalice broke in transit. I got three 12's, two 8's, and three blondes. Cracking the 12 in celebration of the New Year, bowl season (damnit PSU), and the Winter Classic tonight (go Pens!)
A - This beer kind looks a bit similar to other Belgian-styled Quads in that shows as a murky brown, copper, almost muddy purple color. Head is a nice, 2-fingered frothy cap, but retention is a bit on the poor side. Not much lacing at all, surprisingly.
S - As this beer warms up, the aroma really picks up and grows in complexity. Initially a bit muted, as it aerates the bouquet of Belgian yeast, sweeter malts, grapes, plums, and apples. There is that noticeable alcohol smell that is common for the style, but not bad at all. What really stood out to me in this beer compared to others in the style is that while it does have some of the candied sugar smell, it is definitely more toned down compared to some beers which seem to be swimming in it. It just seems more blended and complex as a result. As it approaches room temperature, the grains start to show through which adds an even deeper layer to this already multi-faceted bouquet.
T - If the smell was deep and complex, the flavor profile is that and more. While its possible to note individual flavors in this beer, such as the slight sugar at the front, then the juicy apples and grapes which give way to the alcohol, the overall taste combines all of these elements without giving a clear distinction or transition between them, especially as it warms up. This is both good and bad, as I enjoy being able to pinpoint exact flavors, but it is a testament to how complex this beer is while keeping it from appearing muddled and haphazard. The finish is sweet, long, with a bit of alcohol, but also with the sugar.
M - Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Given the relatively poor head and retention, I wouldn't be surprised if this had a bit of a carbonation problem, but the flatness doesn't kill the beer. Coats the mouth and has a great finish.
D - Drinkability is high. The mouthfeel, flavors, smell... everything comes together to work here. For the 10.2% alcohol, it is really hidden well and is dangerously drinkable.
So is it the greatest beer in the world? That's hard to say. It certainly has an appeal to it due to the rarity and trouble taken to get it, but I'm not sure if that should be taken into account too much. In my opinion, it's an incredible beer, but I think I let the hype get to me a bit and was expecting a bit more. I have a few more bottles, so hopefully in a few years I'll revisit this beer. 3,169 charactersnhindian, Jan 02, 2011

4.6/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Finishing 2010 off with my buddy SpinRSX and the worlds #1 beer!
Appearance - beer pours a dark brown murky like in appearance, very hard to tell any carbonation levels due to the 0 clarity. The head produced a nice brown based foamy head, that had some good volume to it. The head stuck around for a good duration too.
Smell - I found this to be a very dynamic smelling beer, right upfront i was able to pick up some green apples, followed by a hint of grapes. There was almost, buried a little deeper, some dark fruits, possible raisin like in smell. 
Taste - Dark tones right off the top, followed with some sweetness but as well raisins. The end produced a little hop with some bitterness. I found the alcohol was well hidden. One thing i noted, there where signs of a "dry" fruit to this beer.
Mouthfeel - the carbonation levels increase and the deep raisin taste. As well, i found as the beer warmed the alcohol came fwd a bit more. This is where i was able to pick up a hint of sweetness, very nice.
Drinkability - SpinRSX and i had this debate, but i think this is a well rounded beer and brings complexity to the menu. This is something that was more of an investment and a sample, but if i could drink it daily i would love too. 1,243 charactersSwedes21, Dec 31, 2010

330ml Bottle
Appearance - The beer pours a murky brown colour with a very large frothy beige coloured head. I can't see much carbonation due the murkiness of the beer and there is some excellent lacing running in stages down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for several minutes before it began to dissipate. There was a small amount of sediment on the bottom of the bottle.
Smell - apples were the first thing that came to mind, also malts, dark fruits, an earthiness
Taste & Mouth - The beer actually has quite a bit of carbonation but it still feels smooth and creamy on the tongue. Most of the taste is made up of malts, dark fruits (rasins?), and some light hops. As the temperature of the beer got warmer the flavour of the beer really seemed to change. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and this beer is very easy to drink. The beer finishes with a malty and sweet aftertaste, there was also a light hop bitterness.
Drink - I'm happy I got to check this beer off my want list. I'm sure the fact that it is hard to get adds to the hype and positive reviews; but it really is a must try and a fantastic beer. 1,157 charactersspinrsx, Dec 31, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52003 Bottle traded from masterhomebrewer. Thanks so much! 
A: Pours a dark mahogany brown, hazy. Didn't pour aggressively, and the head dissipated to a ring. Decent lacing. 
S: Juicy dark fruit. Complex, resiny... dark gushers? There is a musty cherry woodiness as well. Wow. 
T: Right up front I got that dark-fruit gusher taste mixed with an almost leather-mahogany taste. In the middle of the palate it produces a sweetness that reminds me of raw, dark agave syrup. The slightest hint of spiciness and bitterness at the very end. Aftertaste is of pleasant dark cherry. As the beer warms, more pleasant spiciness (like cinnamon and cloves, not peppers) appears. 
M: Velvety smooth on the tongue, with a little bit of carbonation. Body is surprisingly light for a darker beer. There is some stickiness on the tongue.
D: WAY too drinkable for a beer that is booth 10%abv and very hard to find. I could have easily see myself drinking two or three of these in a sitting, despite the higher abv. It just went down so nice. A lot of this may be due to the 7 years it's been aged. 
Notes: I can't believe how good this beer is. For years I've wanted to try it. I tried to calm myself recently so as not to over-hype it, so I approached this tasting with level-headedness. It blew me out of the water. 
My wife LOVED it. She has tried (mainly sipped) almost every beer I have and isn't really a huge fan of many. This, on the other hand, she tried to drink all of. I had to pry it out of her hands a few times. She says she likes it more then most drinks in general. 
Is it the best beer in the world? Well, I still have a lot of beer to taste before I pass that judgment. I would also need to taste a fresh Westy as well as an aged St. Bernardus Abt 12
and/or Rochefort 10 (only had them fresh) before I truly make the call. Any which way, it is a phenomenal beer. 1,868 charactersuberkane, Dec 31, 2010
3.61/5  rDev -21.7%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I've been holding off on this for a while to prepare myself for the hype, so lets see how this "famous" beer holds up to the lumpen proletarian sentiment.
Pours a murky amber-brown with a rocky off-white head. Smells of wine, peppery yeast, wheat spice, kind of like hopped up Bitburger. Taste is subdued, sweet but not in your face; I get some cola, toffee, white wine, hop bitterness on the very back that is barely there, some clove spice, mellow flavor for sure. I like the mellowness of this compared to similar brews with in-your-face spice that makes me wish I was drinking something else. Carbonation is high and mouthfeel isn't thick at all; very drinkable as the sugars aren't cloying, the pepper-clove character seems to cleans that 'sugar overload' from the palate. Drinkability was marked down to the exclusivity of this, if I could find it down the street I would sit through a sixer of it and crawl on my lips to my bed. A decent beer indeed, but nothing I'd trade something special out of my cellar for. Verdict: the best of the Belgian styles that I have tried thus far, but certainly not a game changer for me. 1,129 charactersyouradhere, Dec 30, 2010

This was the first of a 3 beer tasting with Abt12 and Rochefort 10. 330ml bottles, 3 people tasting, so the pours were small. The Westy had the edge over the Saint Bernardus and the Rochefort. The Westy was older than the other two.
A dark chestnut color. Not a big head. Not much more to say without a big robust pour that was not possible with the size of the bottle and number of glasses (3) that needed filling. Pretty beer. 4.5
S Aromas were rounded with nothing sharp. Plums and dried fruit come first, but as it sits some biscuity, bready aromas are detectible as well. Very clean and inviting. 4.5
T Chocolatey taste at first, more dried fruit, most like plums. There is some lingering sweetness, but it is a dry beer. This is one of the better balanced beers I have tried. 5 
M This beer has a nice thickness on the tongue. The carbonation was a little lighter than the other Belgian beers we tried this night, but didn't seem to detract from the beer.  4.5
D It is high in alcohol, therefore you won't be drinking a lot of these at one sitting. However, aside from the high alcohol, it is one of the most drinkable Belgian beers I have tried. Wonderful. 5 1,211 charactersboss302, Dec 29, 2010

poured from bottle into goblet.
A: rich reddish golden brown. small light head that lingers well.
S. My goodness, i wish i could inhale this lovely bouquet for much longer than my lungs provide capacity for. Dark fruits, sweetness and a little alcohol comes through. mouthwatering to say the least.
T. I'm really not sure how to get into it... Theres so much i want to try to describe, but i am left for an utter loss for associations. Dark fruits comes through, and a nice level of heat from the alcohol, though it is amazingly enshrouded in drinkable flavor. I'm sure if i let it age for longer, the heat would have become even more subdued and incorporated. Each taste is a new experience as different subtle flavors grab my attention. The slight afternotes of hoppiness are exquisitely balanced with the sweeter richer flavors, leaving a kind of dryness that begs you to take another sip. As the beer warms closer to room temperature the uniqueness of each sip is exacerbated, the intense web of subtleties which give this beer its incredible foundation become more prominent. im really not sure how to pinpoint the particular flavors. familiar, yet denser, more complex, more "whole" sweetnesses and bitternesses. 
M. Silky, but not oily. it gently covers the palate and reveals new sensations as air circulates around my tastebuds.
D. incredibly drinkable for its alcohol content. gives an experience that is truly unique and fulfilling in all beer drinking aspects. 1,525 charactersbrendanbeer, Dec 26, 2010

Appearance: Really deep cloudy brown in color. Gushed just a tiny bit as I opened the bottle. Poured a nice two beige head that left a nice lacing around the top and left a little lacing around the glass. 
Aroma: Beautiful bouquet of cinnamon, rum, molasses and vanilla. All are beautifully integrated and nothing dominates. Molasses and caramel notes compliment the breadiness in the background. Perfectly balanced and complex.
Taste: All the notes from the aroma are here too. Molasses and vanilla create a really nice backdrop to all the spices here. The alcohol creates a nice warming during each sip, though it is not perfectly hidden. Brown sugar and caramel notes are also quite nice. Good balance and remarkable subtly and complexity. 
MouthfeeL: Full bodied and creamy. The amount of carbonation in this beer was more than I expected.
Drinkability: Really smooth and drinkable for the ABV. The things pulling my score down here in this section are availability, alcohol content, and price.
Overall, a really great beer and possibly my favorite of this style. I didn't expect this to be my number one beer of all time, but I definitely enjoyed it immensely. I'm really happy to have tried this and crossed it off my beer bucket list. 1,369 charactersGosox8787, Dec 25, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Christmas Eve, 2010. 5 years and 1 day on BA fcr me. Kids are asleep, presents wrapped, house is clean (more or less). . . time to celebrate with my first Westy 12.
A big thanks to MRMOJORISIN for the bottle - and 15+ years of sharing great beer, great tunes and good times.
Best-by date on the bottle cap is 9.11.11. Allowed the bottle to sit at room temperature for about 10-12 minutes. Not sure if that's enough to take the chill off, but I'm like my 6-year old on Christmas Eve right now - that is, excited and anxious, and asking for patience is just unreasonable.
A: A slight gush upon popping the cap is followed by a careful effort to decant the yeast. Poured into a Piraat snifter/tulip-type glass (I debated between this glass, a Duvel tulip and a Chimay chalice). Body is dark brown with a light-khaki-colored 1/2-finger head. Head settles fairly quickly to a film, with some bubbles rising to fortify the foam and popping like the occasional stray fireworks on the Fourth of July. Leaves some splotchy lace. Notwithstanding the careful pour, there is plenty of sediment in suspension.
S: The smell is wonderful, and - besides the slight gusher upon opening - provides the first impression. Raisins, candied sugar, dried fruits in general are all present in a candy-like package. Hint of black licorice too. Waft of alcohol as it warms up a bit more.
T: Here goes. . . When my father-in-law drinks SNPA, he puts it down very quickly and is fond of saying "it's like candy." Well, THIS is like candy. Those dark fruits are there, along with candied sugar. Regular fruit too - some berries or maybe cherries (slightly booze-soaked). Alcohol warmth - it's warm, not hot - is felt on the way to the belly, but in a soft, not harsh, kind of way. Slight drying from the alcohol at the finish of the sip too. Lingering bitterness seems somewhat tannic.
M: Like a good Belgian - there is a fine fizziness that makes it feel lighter in heft than it really is, and almost airy on the palate. That fizziness helps to cleanse the palate after each sip
D: Extremely drinkable, especially for a beer of this strength. I'd give it a 6 if I could in this category. 2,166 charactersKendo, Dec 25, 2010

A= wonderful smell of Belgian sugar. Typical Belgian spiciness, but not booze smelling considering this is over 10% abv.
T= more Belgian sugar, spiciness and dark fruit flavor that all meld together nicely. Sill impresses that this isn't as boozer as expected. As it warms all the above flavors shine through even more.
M=the water used In his is incredibly soft! And the mouthfell is actually not as thick and heavy as expected buy is nice none the less.
Overall this is a terrific beer. And most certainly the best quad I have ever tasted. Seems more restrained then most bug Belgians which is nice. 705 characterswebbcreative, Dec 24, 2010

Pours a dark brown with a good amount of off-white head, lots of lacing.
Scent is of dark fruits, raisins, a sweet sugar presence, and a hint of booze.
The taste is similar - dark fruits, figs, raisins, and a sugary sweetness in the back.
This is medium-bodied and creamy with a well-balanced moderate level of carbonation.
This is a great beer. A quadrupel that I can drink all night (I wish I had enough to do that). I had this at a tasting with Westy 8 as well and I found it interesting that this was less boozy than that. Is this worthy of the title of "best beer in the world"? That's for you to decide. But I'll doubt you'll call it anything but a great beer regardless. 695 charactersstrangefate, Dec 24, 2010

A: Dark hazy reddish-brown body. Three finger off-white head leaves lots of lacing.
S: Mostly dark fruits and sugar. 
T: Ridiculously complex. Plums, raisins, brown sugar, and gingerbread. Peppery alcohol. A hint of noble hop bite. Finishes somewhat dry.
M: Rich and creamy. Practically melts in your mouth.
D: The million-dollar question: is this the best beer on Earth? First off, I should note that my bottle was pretty young and still had some heat on it. I think it would improve with age. Anyway, this was an excellent beer, and I feel privileged for having had a chance to drink it. Whether it's the best is, of course, subjective, but I'd definitely put it in the conversation. However, Rochefort 10 did just a little bit more for me. Honestly, though, all the elite Trappist beers are superlative in their own way. 917 charactersBarrelO, Dec 19, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I felt EXTREMELY privileged to share a bottle with some CouchSurfing friends of mine in late-July 2010 while staying with them in Pittsburgh. I attended their wedding a couple of years ago and they received some bottles as a wedding present and held them for one of my visits. My Facebook page shows us drinking this beer on a hot, humid night as took the best notes possible.
I was (hopefully) getting smarter as I went along. I only gently poured a little better than half of the bottle after it foamed continually once the cap was popped. Its color was a deep brown with good clarity, excepting a slight sludge in the well of the glass. Nose was really rich with a good bit of alcohol heat accompanying notes of fudge, anise and licorice. The mouthfeel was REALLY hot, medium-to-full, and filled my mouth with caramel, burnt brown sugar and molasses. It was MUCH sweetr than any of us expected. Finish had a sugary, malty heat that seemed to linger, killing the other underlying flavors. I also poured the lees separately, and they turned out to be comparable to the taste of the beer initially without the heat, perhaps even a bit sweeter.
I am not discounting how good this beer was, especially in the face of so many horrible CANQuest (TM) beers, but neither did I hear the singing of angels or have any sort of religious experience. 1,341 characterswoodychandler, Dec 18, 2010

Poured into a Chimay glass
Appearance:
Initial pour is clear dark ruby. Head is good and lingering despite slow pour so as not to disturb the sediment. Last of the 3 of us sharing this bottle had an understandably cloudy pour.
Aroma:
Deep malt sweetness. Excellent yeast esters giving light fruit notes. Carmel and wisps port. Fig and date with soft alcohol.
Taste:
Complex malt, sweet candied sugar, dates, leather dried plum and warm alcohol. I haven't the words. Very low hop bitterness without being overly sweet. 
Mouth-feel:
Smooth and full. Warming alcohol. Very pleasant aftertaste. Carbonation is excellent.
Drinkability:
Price alone hurts the score here. I could drink this all day...slowly, but all day. 760 charactersLakes, Dec 14, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Westy 12 pours a hazy dark brown with almost a maroon or purplish tinge. The pour into my Duvel chalice creates a decent tan head that dissipates but leaves quite a bit of lacing. The aroma on this beer is outstanding. It's a great blend of dark fruits, brown sugar, and Belgian yeast. There's a little bit of booze to tie it together.
The taste is far more subtle than I had expected. This is not a bad thing. Similar to the smell, dark figs or plums are prominent. A definite flavor of charred brown sugar. A small hit of crisp, light hops. Complex yet restrained. Beautifully balanced, with just the right amount of booze. The mouthfeel is very sticky, with carbonation lighter than I'd expected. I did my best to pace myself, but it was gone before I knew it.
Now, obviously, I can't answer the question about whether this is the best beer in the world. That's a completely subjective question. I can do a little better by comparing it to other quads. I would need to taste them side-by-side a few times to really make up my mind, but my first instinct is that I like St. Bernardus Abt 12 a tiny bit better. But if you're a Belgian beer fan, or any sort of beer fan at all really, Westy 12 is worth at least some of the hype and is an absolute must-try. 1,259 charactersCharlatanSin, Dec 14, 2010

A: Pours a muddy brown color with a good amount of head that had good retention.
S: Lots of really complex smells in here. I pick up sweet berries, raisins and spices. Maybe some chocolate as well.
T: Very nice. Somewhat boozy. Other than the obvious Fruit and sweet sugar tastes, there is maybe a bit of black liquorish.
M: Thin, nicely carbonated and well balanced. Lots of flavor for a beer of this weight.
D: Impossible to find, so that hurts the score. Great beer for sure, but I just don't think that that much better than some of the other more readily available Trappist Beers.
Edit: Upped the overall a bit, as I take into account the beer experience. One part of that for me is availability, and this one seems to have become increasingly more available. 921 charactersBeerThursdays, Dec 13, 2010

A.
appearance is a brownish and dark ruby red color (when held up to light). A huge amount of very light khaki head...About 3 fingers worth that is very ice cream like. Insane amount of lacing on the glass as well, even to the very last sip.
S.
Lives up to the hype! Booze soaked dark fruits like figs, raisin, prunes, etc. A very sweet aroma like brown sugar and caramel. A little wine smell as well, like a good port. Absolutely fantastic.
T.
again. Fantastic. Where to start? Sweet sugars and dark fruits with a little booze. A little caramel apple in there. Such a complex beer. You also get some of that Belgian yeast, spice and a little bit of bitterness in there. There is so much going on with this beer. Each taste and smell is something different. 
M.
medium bodied. huge amounts of carbonation. A little bit of bitterness and a dry finish, like a wine. 
D.
Wish I could rate this a 5 but I can't. If it was easy to find, cheaper and a little lower ABV, I'd rate this a 5. Even with the high ABV, the booze is hidden really well. It is still there in the nose and taste, but not as strong as I thought. I will definitely be going out of my way to try and grab more of these. Definitely an A+ beer that lives up to the hype! 1,304 characterscetherid, Dec 12, 2010

The taste is everything the aroma promises. Dates, rum soaked raisins, candi sugar, cherries, pears, Belgian yeast, and grapes. There also is some spice, perhaps cinnamon? This is a nice sweet Quadrupel, which is not overly sweet. There is a nice complexity of flavors, and there are flavors in this beer which I cannot pick out. All the same, I would not change a thing.
Medium to full bodied and perfectly carbonated. I can taste some of the alcohol, but there is no alcohol burn at all. The alcohol is definitely warming though. This is also a smooth and creamy beer. Drinking beer does not get any better than this. The drinkability is off the charts, and I must seek this out again. 892 charactershardy008, Dec 12, 2010

A - pours with a quarter inch of loose, sudsy very light tan colored foam. some sediment started creeping out of the bottle before I stopped short, saving that for later. the beer is cloudy, very dense amber/brown in color.
S - insane amounts of dark, juicy fruits....figs, raisins, red grapes, cherries...some leathery and tobacco notes, brown sugar, bubblegum, white wine, brown sugar, and caramel. I could probably go on for another 15 minutes. nice.
T - begins with a pleasant mix of sugary sweetness and yeasty Belgian notes. brown sugar, massive amounts of candi sugar, dark fruits (apples, raisins, figs), yeasty phenols, leather, molasses, spices (nutmeg and black pepper) just come alive in the mouth. light notes of boozy vodka, aspirin, and banana near the end. as complex as the nose and just as enjoyable.
M - light to medium body with very sharp, dense, and pinchy carbonation. insanely refreshing and awakening alcohol burn, though it certainly doesnt drink like a 10% beer. burns the mouth (pleasantly) with the history of generations of Trappist monks. 
D - an insanely well crafted beer here, the fact they can pull off flavors like this without any flashy ingredients is just mind boggling. just cant begin to describe how complex yet delicately constructed this one is. a real treat, and worthy of its own special occasion. cheers to the monks of St. Sixtus for this one. 1,556 charactersStigs, Dec 12, 2010

Despite a gentle pour to keep the yeast caked at the bottom of the bottle from being disturbed, nearly two fingers of off white head. The head continued to grow after I stopped pouring, and build peaks of foamy head out of the opening of the glass, reaching three fingers plus in height. The beer is dark and somewhat clear brown, with scarlet streaks at the edge when held up to the light. Tons of carbonation streaming from the bottom of the glass. Really impressive looking beer.
Nose is dark fruits, plums and raisins, dark caramel, and yeast notes. 
Taste is a nice balance of sweetness from the dark fruits, malty caramel sweetness and a dry light hop bitterness. Alcohol is very well hidden in this beer, despite its relative young age as it was brewed earlier this year. Compared to other Belgian quads, this definitely drinks the easiest, but the flavor complexity is a bit lacking compared to the others. 
Medium body with lots of light bubbled carbonation that sweeps gently across your tongue. A drinkable and inviting beer, but flavor wise isn't as impressive as I had hoped. 1,176 charactersnataku00, Dec 05, 2010

Poured into a chalice. Pours a beautiful dark dark mahogany brown, with a two finger head that laces up the glass. Aroma is of figs, subtle spices, a bit of alcohol, some dark fruits. Taste is...wow. Incredibly complex, A lot of caramel, a bit of booze, figs, slightly bitter, gives a wonderful warming feeling on its way down. The malt backbone is spectacular, and a fruity aftertaste lingers around the lips. The mouthfeel is the best I have ever had. It slides around so smoothly, and the gentle carbonation pops all over the tongue, bringing out the taste. It is full bodied, and goes down incredibly easily for a beer of this ABV.
This is great, beyond question. It is the best beer I have had so far, but I think that there are a very very small percentage of better beers out there. But for now, long live the king! 953 charactersramseye4, Nov 29, 2010

4.48/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4So after all the reading about, hearing about, and let's face it - hype - associated with this beer, I have finally opened my single bottle I acquired on eBay.
As always, I will try to comment here away from what has gone previously. My ranking or specific commentary is worthless to pros. I am but a novice. I know what I like. I like quads, strong dark ales with complexity and flavor. 
As I pour it into a goblet, I notice the lack of head, and an unassuming semi translucent mahogany hue.
The bottle is colder than I like to drink. But my pattern is to start chilled and let it come up to room temp before I start seriously sipping. 
Aroma is very subdued, Earthy, but not heady - not revealing too much of what's to come.
What comes is nothing short of history in a bottle. The mystery and intrigue of centuries of Trappist Monks creating the ultimate ale is present in every sip. 
Once again I am forced to reference legend. If there was ever a beer that could eclipse the stories of Mead, Treacle, Butter Beer or Ambrosia - this truly is a magical nectar in our physical mundane, Muggle world. The words "flagon", "quaff" and "tavern" were created to accessorize this ale. 
I can't imagine what standardization needs to be in place to vote something the "best beer in the world". It seems like a ludicrously subjective classification. And as amazing as this beer is - I'm not saying that I'd choose it every or all night. But really -there is no "next best contender" to this beer, because it is unique in its approach and scope. A heady breath of dark, slightly figgy, mildly sweet (and I mean mild) malt flavors hits the tongue and then dissipates into... more of the same. Instead of transmuting into some phenol-ridden, frothy fluff - the flavor just exponentially increases and drapes as it travels over your palette. 
As I get to the bottom of the bottle, the cloudy sediment shows its presence. Flavors are hard to isolate because the blend has been perfected into a cohesive whole ONEness. But some fig, currant and - as God is my witness - LOAM come to the top of the pile. 
The hype is high on this one because of its legendary rareness. One in a while hype is justified. Sometimes, you just need to recognize that the laws of supply and demand are affected by real world lay-lines of taste and appreciation.
There are so many magical fables that we can't reach out and touch. If, as a child - you ever longed for Brigadoon, Narnia, Middle Earth or Neverland to be real - go through the motions and acquire a bottle of this beer. It's worth the trouble to reaffirm your sense of humility and wonder in the world. 2,639 charactersradioscooter, Nov 25, 2010

A- Reminds us of autumn in Belgium, even tough most people in the room have never been. Nutty and carmel color. With tones of amber and small bubbles on the frothy, lacy top. Looks like a pancake ready to be flipped.
Smell = Sweet caramel apple, with a hint of bitter.
Taste = Strong and yet sublime. You taste but there is no bitter after taste. Its just perfect tasting. Little bit of sweet and sour, apple under tones.
Mouth & Drink = Just smooth. Taste a bit of froth. It warms you up, the first sip you feel it in your stomach. 
The drink equivalent of Oh NOM NOM NOM!
Great way to spend a lunch break. I don't think this is the best beer I've ever had, but I am very appreciative of the rare opportunity to try it. Here's to the last sip. 852 charactersfoxbat2500, Nov 24, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This will be my 200th review and I wanted to have a special beer for that milestone. My wife delivered that to me for our anniversary by getting her hands on a couple of bottles of Westvleteren 12. Perfect!
I kept putting the instant read thermometer to the side of the bottle to ensure that I was drinking this beer at the recommended temperature. 
I poured the beer and took a photo of the bottle and bottle cap next to the Westvleteren chalice that my wife got me to go with the beer. The color of the beer appeared almost purple but on closer inspection it is a deep, ruddy brown that is mostly opaque. The head, the color of toasted marshmallow, rises quickly and thick (more than 2") and had enough structure to exceed the bounds of the edge of the glass by a good 1/2". I dared not go further than that in fear of spilling even one drop of this difficult-to-procure elixir. The head did fall down into a dense, sudsy surface coating with a thick ring that left sheets of foamy lace. 
One smell and I realized that I have smelled better. Figs and brown sugar matched with an alcohol warmth greet the nose without overpowering it. Tropical fruit esters are thrown off and are backed up by a barely perceptible sense of black pepper.
I really expected a lot more bold flavors and an orgasmic or, more appropriate, religious experience, but it does not live up to the hype. I suspect the scarcity of this brew and its reputation have driven many of the previous reviews. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious but it's not the be-all, end-all of beer. Cocoa, brown sugar and figs represent for the malts and are in perfect balance with the tropical fruit esters put off by the yeast. Alcohol is well-masked, but is not entirely mitigated, leaving a sense of dark rum laced with one mini-pinch of black pepper. All the flavors work very well together and is the strength of this beer. 
The mouthfeel is silky smooth and surprisingly light with just enough bite to express itself nicely without overpowering the palate. This is one wonderful, wonderful, wonderful beer. I would really love to put down quite a few more of these but that is cost-prohibitive due to the efforts needed to obtain a bottle. Due to the ABV it is also equilibrium-prohibitive. 
Overall this is one amazing quad, but Rochefort 10 does compare favorably as do a few other quads and Belgian strong darks. It earns its reputation as the "Holy Grail of Beer" by the means needed to get a taste of it but once it has been tasted your efforts could be better used for more reasonable endeavors. I am so happy to have had it though and now need to decide when and where to open the second bottle. 2,668 charactersNaugros, Nov 21, 2010

Poured into the Westvleteren chalice.
A - Pours a magnificent dark red amber that seems both opaque and crystal clear at the same time, with a 1/2 inch head that is not going anywhere anytime soon. Seriously, this pillow of off-white foam sits proud and strong in the chalice, leaving a great wall of rich, creamy lacing as you drink.
S - Dark, rich dried fruit, brown sugar, slightly boozy, spiced, phenolic. Oh so complex.
T - Right after pouring, it's very boozy and a tad harsh, but given the chance to breathe, it mellows into a malty, slightly hoppy, slighty fruity and sugary sweet nectar of the gods. Liquid joy.
M - Surprisingly light on the palate with a very fine carbonation. Warms a lot right off the bat, then settles down for a bit, then gives off the warming feel again. Lovely.
D - PROTIP: Let this one breathe for a minute after pouring. It was very boozy and in my face right off the bat, but it settled down into a very drinkable brew once it had the chance to aerate. As for the ABV/feel, it goes to your head pretty quick, but it's a great buzz.
Overall - Oh man, this is a damn good one. I was nervous about opening it, but I'm so glad I did. Every sip I take is in eternal thanks to the good monks who brew this divine libation. I can see why they say this is the best beer of all time. 
And now my glass is empty. Sigh. 1,431 charactersDannyS, Nov 20, 2010

Wow, this beer lives up to the hype for me. I don't think Ive ever had a beer this complex. Those Belgians are onto something here and very well might have a future in brewing.
The appearance is typical for most quads Ive had. Maybe a bit lighter but nice and almost clear. The thin white heads fades fairly quickly. Very little lacing.
The nose is outstanding. A little sweet but more than anything plums and grapes. Really surprised how much fruit I'm getting on the noise. Maybe some faint vanilla and bitter orange. 
For being two years old its still fairly warm but not overbearing. I know its a high ABV by the taste but its doesn't knock me over either.Actually the warmness doesn't come into play until the finish. The taste is self is a nice and balanced sweetness in combination with some plums and vanilla. 
The mouth feel is great. The carbonation is low to medium and doesn't not put off any of the sharpness some over carbonated beers tends to do. 
Really enjoyed this one cant wait to get the next. 1,036 charactersAndrewNations, Nov 16, 2010

A: Very Cloudy brown body with a small tan head. Very light lacing and only a small ring of bubbly cover. Significant grit on the bottom.
S: Brown sugar and raisins jump out immediately with a slightly hot and slightly solvent character. No hop aroma.
T: Slight cardboard... may be a bit oxidized. Slightly sweet raisin and maple flavors. Spicy yeast character (not much of a surprised based on the appearance) and just enough hops to balance the sweet body. No lingering aftertaste.
M: Medium to light body and light carbonation. Brief carbonic bite that caught me off guard.
D: This particular bottle is unimpressive and not particularly enjoyable. There is definite potential here, but I'll need to track down another bottle to realize.
O: I think I bought a defective bottle. Very disappointing. I'm sure that this one can perform better, but I'll need to come back and revise when I get a chance to sample the beer again. Hopefully for Christmas. 1,001 charactersdpnelson1978, Nov 06, 2010

A: Pure brown. Cannot see though it. Awesome color. Head was 1.5 fingers with pretty good retention.
S: Lively aroma with more new notes at each new smell. Dark fruits mostly - raisin, plum, currant. Spicy with anise and nutmeg. Slight whiff of alcohol covered quickly. Slight hint of those baked cinnamon and sugar coated almods you can find from street vendors.
T: Amazingly complex. Dark fruits of course. Slight hint of rum soaked fruits and a bit of rum itself. Fruitcake. Vanilla. Earth. Brown sugar-coated roasted nuts. Clove and other spices. Finish is crazy as well. Somewhat alcoholic then covered with a flood of flavors - wood, yeast, tobacco. Brown sugar. Anise. 
M: Very smooth and the alcohol does not dry, amazingly.

I was not able to take deatiled notes on this one, but I did make some shorthand and took mental notes in order to prepare a small review. I plan to take more detailed notes on my next opportunity to try this rare find.
Thanks to Don Lowman for sharing 3 of Westy 8s & 12s with the group, a very generous gesture indeed.
Appearance is dark brown/chestnust in color with a creamy tan head. Complex aromas of dark fruits, followed by Belgian yeast spice notes and dark fruity malts. Tastses as it smells with and amazingly smooth and well rounded flavor profile. A sacred brew worthy of sacred appreciation. Full body with medium+ carbonation and semi creamy mouthfeel. Surprisingly drinkable at 10% abv. I personally enjoyed the Westy 8 better than the 12, but I am curious to try both again and take some detailed notes. 910 charactersunclejimbay, Nov 04, 2010

2003 vintage. I've been lucky enough to try this several times but this is actually the first time I've ever had one in my possession. They always get cracked at tastings but its never found its way into my possession. My willpower lasted about 2 months before I i was forced to crack it open. The beer pours a muddy brown with just a bit of a head that leaves no lacing. Actually the heads kind of ugly. Big fish eye bubbles. No lacing. The aroma is chocolate and dark fruits. Sweet maraschino cherries with toffee. A hint of booze. Nails. The flavor is fairly similar. Pure coco powder up front with date and fig. Big sweet cherries with dark fruits. Caramel and toffee with just a hint of toast. Just a bit of sweet molasses. The mouthfeel is honestly the worst part of the beer. It honestly a bit thin. I don't know if its the prolonged aging that has thinned out the body but its not quite what I remember. Overall, this beer is fantastic. There's really not much more then that. 1,021 charactershwwty4, Oct 31, 2010

A- Nice brown body, minimal head and it settles quickly. Beer is lighter in color than I was expecting.
S- Wonderful nose here- plums, pears, all sorts of brandy-soaked fruit. Molasses or brown sugar.
T- Lighter presence on the tongue than the nose was leading me to expect. Dark fruit, a bit of peppercorn, a hint of orange peel and cinnamon. A bit of earthy malts. As it comes up to room temperature, it opens up a bit and lush malt notes come out. 
M- Lower carbonation works well for it. 
D- Moderate. Easy enough to drink, a pain in the ass to procure, and no better than a handfull of other top-tier quads that are sitting on local shelves. A delicious beer- but not the stuff of legends. 
A big thanks again to Thijs for the hookup. Saving my other bottle to do a quad comparison tasting. 877 charactersShogoKawada, Oct 30, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to dvelcich & lurchingbeast!
Poured at room temperature into a big 25 oz snifter on 10/26/10. The cap carries a date of April 29, 2013; had it right after Rochefort 10 so there's some comparison in notes.
Appearance 5/5
Clear mahogany brown with a massive, very light brown, rocky "Belgian" head, with good head retention and good lacing.
Aroma 4.5/5
Little alcohol, compared to Rochefort 10. Toasty malts with warm richness, raisins and dried plums; like a pie that's still in the oven! There's some chocolate as well, but no coffee. Little, if any, phenolic notes: I have heard that Westmalle & Westvleteren use the same yeast but I can't see any similarity.
Taste 4.5/5
Effervescent and slightly sweet at the beginning, with elements of caramelized sugar along with dark fruit in taste. A long, long finish that is dark, slightly bitter, rich, comforting, and warm, with a slight tannic astringency. This is not the best tasting beer I have had, but this sure is a magnificent beer. Only a fool could underrate its merit. Very complex with dessert like sweetness, very present hop bitterness, and wine and over brewed tea like tannic finish; the finish wouldn't have been as clean without that sharpness of character. This beer deserves to be the legend it is. I have rated some other beers higher and I will do so in future too, but this beer is quite an experience.
Mouthfeel 5/5
I have the exact same comment as I had for Rochefort 10: "The body is medium, but its presence immense." However, the mouthfeel on this one is lighter than Rochefort 10.
Drinkability 5/5
Supreme!
Other
Had it again two days later, side by side with Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12, Rochefort 8, Chimay Blue, Cuvee Van De Keizer Blauw, and Trois Pistoles. Although I am rating Westvleteren 12 higher than Rochefort 10, it's only because of better looks and absence of alcohol in aroma; these two, although very different, are just as good as each other in my opinion. My taste preferences lean more towards Rochefort 10, which is a good thing because that's way easier to come by. 2,077 characterstewaris, Oct 29, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Acquired at some small, excellent store I don't remember the name of in Brussels in April 2009. Decided to crack open the bottle with my wife on our third anniversary. Poured into the Kasteel chalices we used for our wedding toast.
 Pours a pretty reddish-garnet color, topped by a big, thick, creamy tan head that holds its shape for a good long while. Aroma of sweet malt, brown and candi sugars, and lots of dark fruit (fig and plum). Palate is smooth, strong, sweet, and complex. Sweet dark fruit and dark brown sugar up front mellow into a malty, more balanced profile in the back of the mouth. A nice, nutty character (toasted hazelnut?) comes through on the swallow, adding depth to the sweetness that's akin to dark fruit dipped in honey.
 Body is silky smooth, well-carbonated but not bubbly, full and creamy but not overly thick. A warming dose of booze comes through on the swallow, accentuating the complexity of the beer. On the whole, this is just a masterpiece. I wish it were easier to obtain, but I understand and appreciate why it is not. 1,056 charactersElGordo, Oct 28, 2010

cap is printed with 18.06.11
dark reddish brown. yeast easy to disturb, so it's hard to decant, even after settling in fridge for 3 weeks. thus, pretty murky. 1-finger off-white head fades to wispy layer w/ sudsy ring. splotchy, thin little rings of lace all the way down the glass. the dregs do integrate smoothly tho; no chunks.
aroma: port and sherry, spiced rum note. caramel, brown sugar, licorice, candied orange peel. mild whiff of hops. raisins, dates, gentle phenols and alcohol in back.
taste: very much like a sweet fortified wine, w/ notes of rum again. very caramelized, then fruit esters. mild grassy hopping w/ mild to moderate bitterness, intermingling w/ spices (nutmeg, anise, licorice, candied orange peel) and "cleaned" up by mild phenols and alcohol.
medium body, smooth despite ABV, almost silky, but punctuated by alcohol and phenol bite. mild carbonation helps body somewhat. dregs are creamy.
quite drinkable despite the high alcohol and richness.
a very good beer, but seems to me that rarity and hype have pushed this one to extreme heights. still have several other bottles, so will try again, and revise scores if my opinion changes. 1,247 characterschinabeergeek, Oct 24, 2010

A: Small head, with decent lace, murky in appearance and a darker dun color; quite visible sediment.
S: Some smell I can't quite identify, almost smells slightly burnt. Yeast aroma is most prevalent, with prominent malt smells following.
T: Taste is sweeter than expected, slightly sugary with a taste of raisin. Musty yeast and malt flavors. A sort of sawdust pull follows the sweetness that suggests the contents of the bottle might be slightly oxidized. The finish is spicy and a little bit hot. Taste, especially in the yeast and esters, is very rich.
M: Mouthfeel is slightly oily, light with carbonation, a little bit syrupy but not out and out thick. Goes down fairly light, but leaves a slickness behind.
D: Fairly drinkable, but a bit to sweet and rich to be drinking often. A little bit of solvency was a deterrent also, but also likely to be a result of oxidation. Slight burn is a reminder of the ABV.
NB - I would like to revisit this beer again when I can be sure that I am not tasting a compromised sampling. Enjoyable despite that, though. 1,099 charactersChronofied, Oct 24, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally got a chance to drink this. About to buy an awesome new house, so figured it was time to crack this baby. A huge thanks to Brabander for getting my a couple fresh bottles I can age a bit. In the mean time I also have to thank kkipple and nickd717 for pre-aged bottles to try in the mean time. I believe this specific bottle is from nickd717.
Pours with no carbonation, absolutely zero head with just a few light bubbles from air being mixed in as I poured. I wonder if that was a mistake capping, or something, I'll have to try another one sometime and see if that's better. The beer is super thick and a yeast chunked swamp. It's so thick looking the yeast is completely suspended in it like Jello. It's the color of maple syrup mahogany brown wood.
The nose brings tons of fruit, apple, pear, apricot, raisin, and more. Then plenty of Belgian dark malts, not so heavy though, more delicate actually. Some chewy like malt aromas, a light essence of dark candi sugar, some sweetness, and almost no booze aromas.
The taste comes rich and somewhat creamy, lots of Belgian dark malts, and some light ones too. It is kinda barleywine like with the way all the malts and fruits come together. The fruit flavors bring a lot of various fruits, a light apple, pear, fig, raisin, etc, and a light caramel apple flavor. A bit of dark candi sugar, some candy bar flavors, touch of brown sugar. A very light bitterness too. It's extremely smooth and drinks like a 7-8% beer and not 10+%. It finishes with some light sweetness, a little candi sugar, lingering fruits and Belgian dark malts, and a very light toffee. It really is delicious.
The mouth is somewhat thick, creamy, and very smooth, a little syrupy, but the lack of carbonation gets it.
It drinks very smoothly and very well. It's not sticky at all either, and no off flavors. I could easily pound this like it's water, if it didn't taste so good. Again the only thing that hurts it a bit is the lack of carbonation. 1,977 charactersjlindros, Oct 24, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to lurchingbeast for sharing this one in a recent trade. Poured into a long-stemmed tulip during the Eagles' game today. Best by date on the cap reads 17-11-12.
The color is a deep brown, as garnet only shows up when viewed at an angle with a bit of backlighting. The head is full, creamy, and well retained, and there are clumps of foam indicating active yeast cultures that form on top of the beer. there is a good amount of irregular lace that sticks all over the walls of the glass.
Full of toffee and caramel from a distance, the aroma develops to include some cocoa, dark fruits (dates and raisin), and some nutty malt notes.
The taste is similar, as the dates, raisins, toffee, caramel, and some spicy, funky yeasty notes start of the profile. Cocoa powder makes a subtle appearance later, bringing with it the nutty maltiness that really rounds out the flavor.
The body is full and creamy without being too heavy or overwhelming. It works nicely with the carbonation and the flavors to create a sublime drinking experience. While I am not completely blown away, this is still a phenomenal beer. I do wish it was easier to obtain, as this is a top-notch BSDA/'quad' that certainly sets the bar high for the style. 1,231 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Oct 17, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from a 0.33L bottle into my Duvel tulip. Cap is dated 29.03.09, so it is about 4.5 years old. I've had Westy 12 3 times before this, but always relatively fresh and never more than 2 oz.'s or so, so excited to have a full bottle.
a - Pours a dark mahogany brown color with two to three inches of off white head that lasts for four or five minutes. High carbonation evident and a tiny amount of sediment. Left the last oz. or so in the bottle as the amount of sediment was very high in the bottle.
s - Smells of dark fruits, especially cherries, plums and raisins, as well as Belgian yeast. Also getting some grapes/wine smell in it as well. Hints of caramel malts, sweet fruit malts, spices, bready malts, and a touch of alcohol. Very enjoyable; it's very complex and balanced, especially as it warms up and the cherries come out.
t - Tastes of raisins, plums, figs, other dark fruit, bready malts, caramel malts, Belgian yeast, and a hint of spice. Not really getting any alcohol in the taste. Was hoping for more cherries like the smell, but still wonderful. Tasting amazing.
m - Medium body and high carbonation that stings the tongue. It has a nice, smooth body, but the high carbonation hurt it a bit and keeps it from being great.
d - There's a reason it's #1 of BA; it's pretty amazing. While it isn't the #1 beer on my list, it's safe to say it's high on my list. The good news is that the taste and smell are the highlights of this beer. Both are complex and enjoyable. While the high carbonation hurt the mouthfeel a bit, the smell and taste are amazing. It also definitely helps to let this one warm up a bit, so you can fully appreciate everything in the nose and mouth. If you like quads, I think it is safe to say you'll love this beer. I was also surprised how easy it was to drink and how little alcohol was noticable in the taste. I think I like this slightly better than Westy 8, but it's close. I look forward to aging my other 2 bottles and see how they do with even more time on them. 2,017 charactersmdfb79, Oct 10, 2010

Smell: Very complex, dark fruits, milk chocolate. Surprised there is no alcohol present in the nose.
Taste: Again complex. Dark fruits (plums??) milk chocolate. No alcohol flavor. Just a complex multitude of plums, figs, and chocolate.

REVIEW 400
cap reads 2/7/11 - meaning brewed in 2008. 
poured into a russian river belgian glass
pours extremely murky dark brown with slight copper hue and lots of yeasty chunks floating around. about an inch of cocoa creme head. light creamy and frothy retention with a very slight trace of lacing.
sweet and vibrant grape juice with hints of dark fruit like fig and raisin. slight hint of booze.
again, grape juice. sweet and grape like with subtle hints of fig, date, and raisin. very vibrant sweet and boozy combo. not nearly as complex as i had hoped for. this really has a dominating grape flavor. 
moderate carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. 
this is good, cus i love grape juice. but really, this is a bit overrated. i highly preferred the westy 8 to this. i would love to try this fresh. at 12 years old, terrible. at 2 years old, good, whats fresh like? 901 charactershooliganlife, Oct 10, 2010

S: Nose is clove, Belgian yeast, grapes, figs, green apples, and sweet brown sugar. Very alluring and rich. Fruity and sweet. Impossibly complex but balanced at the same time. Alcohol is conspicously missing. 
T: Opens grape, prunes, and clove. Bready and brown sugar. Belgian yeast is very apparent towards the middle where it adds a nice spice and bitterness. Grape gummy sweetness towards middle that tapers off into a slightly twiggy bitterness. Malt forward presence never fades though. Finishes is brown sugar and just the slightest bit of alcohol. Aftertaste is sweet and fruity. 
M: Medium to full bodied, aggressively carbonated and lively but rich and smooth at the same time in the mouth. Finish is clean and aftertaste is filmy and slightly sticky. 
D: Likely the most drinkable 10.2% beer in the world. This one really earns its accolades. Incredible balance and complexity with a mouthfeel that really pulls it all together. Nose is impeccable and even looks great. Definitely one to try and seek out and very much worthy of the praise. 1,426 charactersSpeedwayJim, Oct 04, 2010

4.1/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This was left for me at my apartment by my buddy Charlatansin the weekend of the GABF after he and a bunch of my friends came out. Was excited to finally try this beer after everything I've heard about it.
Appearance- Pours a murky brown mahogany out of the bottle with about a finger of slightly tan head sitting on top. The head dies back relatively quickly to a thin, spotty layer across the bop of the beer. Very small amount of lacing left as I drink as well.
Smell- Smells of booze soaked dark fruits, showcasing figs, dates, and raisins in particular. Complex but a surprising amount of booze showing through on the nose. Doesn't really offend however. 
Taste- Again, big on dark fruits here. Lots of fruity esters showing through, with figs, dates, candy sugar and raisins in particular. Although present, much less booze on the palate and becomes even more well hidden as the beer warms further. Nice.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is substantial and well carbonated but surprisingly more carbonated that I was expecting. I will say the beer went down quite easily for the style, especially as it warmed.
Overall a very nice quad, but I didn't find it completely mindblowing. Worth trying for sure but more for the experience than the beer I think. 1,266 charactersboatshoes, Oct 01, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Acquired this bottle through the most generous and random wedding gift we received. Poured from the bottle into a champagne flute. Served around room temperature.
The aroma was amazing. Dark sugars and rum/raisin. 
The appearance was nice, a dark brown color with a small white head.
The taste was amazing. Tons of dark, rummy sugars. Lots of figs, but zero alcohol burn. 
This was an amazing beer. I am not worldly enough to say best beer or not, but it was an amazing beer and I feel fortunate to get to try one. 518 charactersgtn80, Sep 27, 2010
3.84/5  rDev -16.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Bottle from a great BA digita7693. Cap 16.2.13
bottle share with a good friend that is a home brewer and great BA as well.
Pours like a carbonation bomb. I hate waiting 5 minutes and pouring 5 times in order to try a beer. But oh well, looks good otherwise. Pours a dark burnt amber color (once it settles and I can actually see color) 
Smells of figs and Belgian Yeast, slight flowery aroma, and also a bit wine-like. 
Taste, well this is where it gets interesting. I didnt get much out of it when it was cold so I let it sit a while. The warmer it got the more figs came out of it. The alcohol is VERY well hidden. can't detect much alcohol at all. The flavors do dance around on the palate, and is very complex as well. not sure if they blend all that well, or that this is really worth the hype, but it is a good beer. Still way too carbonated for me, and the entire time I was drinking this I was swirling it out. mouthfeel is diminished because of that, but again, as I got down to the end, and it was warmer and less carbonated it got much better. I am not a huge fan of working my beer as I drink it, but so be it.
Not AWESOME, but it was good. i wouldnt go out of my way to try it again, but am glad I did drink into the hype machine at least once, and have another in the cellar to age and review again. But as many have said, St. B 12 isn't that too far off if not better. 1,385 characterscrusian, Sep 22, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. Date on the cap of 08.01.11, so bottled in 2008 I believe. Pours a hazed deep mahagony reddish brown color with a slighlty off white head. Some sediment evident in the glass. A solid mix of aromas in the nose including fruit like raisins, spice, and alcohol. Also get plums in the nose. Medium mouthfeel with some carbonation that dances across the tongue. Dark fruits and subtle sweetness dominate the flavor. Some evidence of the alcohol in the taste. Pretty smooth and exceptional tasting. Other flavors that I can pick out include molasses and caramel. Nice sweetness left in the mouth after your drink. So, how does the "#1" beer in the world rate? It's hard to imagine how any such beer can be #1 for me. This is a great, very smooth drinking, well made beer for sure. The fact that you can only get it from the monastery has to come into effect in where it is on the list. Overall, I really like this beer. Its really tasty but I couldn't drink it all the time. Give it up to the monks for making this one. 1,021 characterskbutler1, Sep 19, 2010
3.52/5  rDev -23.6%look: 2.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5It is widely and arguably acknowledged as the best beer on the planet. It has had more heritage and prestige poured into its creation, more exclusivity surrounding its availability, and more debate about its worth than potentially any beer on earth. It is the Westvleteren 12. The bottles come exactly as shown here; no label, and nearly no branding wahtsoever. A thick bevel around the shoulder of the bottle claims Trappisten Bier, and the cap indicates that it is indeed a Westvleteren 12, at 10.2% abv, and thats it.
It is important to understand that this is not the best beer in the world, it is merely the highest rated beer on the planet. There is a difference. 
This posses an interesting predicament that I have come by so many times since engulfing myself in the world of beer; that is trying a beer that has been so outrageously hyped with an untainted preconception of it. Its nearly impossible to ignore the hype and approach it with a clean slate and unbiased palate. It's true, I wanted to love the Westy, but I tried my very hardest to conduct an unobstructed tasting of it before I would relax and simply enjoy it.
The Westy 12 was served to me at cellar temperature around 14C (57F) as a vintage Belgian Quadrupel should be. This allows all of the beer's flavors to stand forward without the cold numbing your palate or any sensations. The pour was easy and straight forward; nothing too elegant, thick or lush - rather uneventful actually. No head built until about halfway up the glass when a soft airy cream colored foam began to build. It showed a smattering of large bubbles scarcely scattered throughout the head eventually building to maybe an inch. It faded fast to a translucent film. The beer was dark and glowing. It was a rich burgundy red with deep ambers, golden browns, and pitches of black trapping any light that came near. It was not totally opaque though, and was crisply transparent. Very pretty, but not nearly as dense or as full as I had expected.
The nose is soft and aromatic in a classic Belgian style. Malted grain bring pale and caramelized flavors into your nose and plays with the range of sweet bread, biscuit, golden raisins, brown sugar, and nuts. Sweetness dominates the air with no hop aroma to be found. Leaning back in for more brings apple juice and cider to my senses and more raisin flavor. Touches of pear and cereal show up, then fresh baked sweet egg bread.
When going in for a sip I was madly excited and nervous. I wanted it to be good, but at the same time was trying not to expect anything. I let the first sip wash over my palate and swirl into ever inch of my mouth. My friends were starring at me in silence awaiting my approval or disapproval. I said nothing and went in for another taste before I made any premature conclusions.
My first impression was of the mouthfeel - it was not thin, but it was definitely not lush. It poured over me with a smooth and silky texture, but was relatively flat and uncarbonated. The years ageing in the bottle may have have stripped the beer of its effervescence faster than I would have assumed. Beyond the mouthfeel was a sweet and fruity wave of malts - big malts. Quick complexity caught my attention at the Westy showed me golden raisins, plums, pears, light golden sugar and grapes. It was richly fruity and a good balance of sweet pale and caramel malts.
No roast, bitter, or tart was apparent to me yet, and I started to wonder how this seemingly one sided beer had claimed the top spot among the beer world's best. The malt was soft but potent, digging deep into my taste buds bringing candy, and sweet molasses. It showed hints of nut and sweet cereal, but lacked the cocoa, earth, citrus or complex presence that I was expecting from a big Quad like this. Regardless of what I was expecting, a delicious soft sweet bread flavor was present. It was the unmistakable flavor of Challa - a sweet egg bread made for Shabot dinner. Soon then came based apples and a hint of tart cider. The sweet was wide and generous, and very delicious. But still, something was lacking; a spice, or herb, or balance... Something.
The finish mimicked everything about this beer so far; it was a short, plain finish with a sweet fruity sensation and little crackle.
Don't get me wrong, this was very delicious, but to me beer is graded by flavor, construction, and sensations. This beer just didn't peak where I had expected it to, and hence the problem with knowing the hype. I would still give the Westy very high grades, just not in the elite class. That being said, two of my friends satting at the table has each had a Westy 12 before, and they both claimed that this tasted different. So, will not make a conclusion on this beer until I have had another. And the hunt continues... 4,790 charactersStephenRich, Sep 14, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from my tasting notes of a decent sized sample I consumed at an epic tasting event held with the members of the SMBDC. I hate to fall victim to inflated scores due to this beer's rarity and reputation, but I do believe it is deserving of the highest ratings I have given.
The beer is clear and has a amber brown color. The head is tan and very bubbly. There is a sweet, semi-dry fruit that makes up the aroma. It smells like some sort of berry, but not one that I can identify (if I knew what it was, I'd go out and buy a pint). The flavor is big but not overbearing. There is some toasted malt and noticeable alcohol. The malts are sweet but never too much so. They impart a hint of strawberries that is most enjoyable. After each swallow the warmth of the alcohol lingers on and keeps you company until you bring the glass back to your lips. It has a medium body and plenty of carbonation. Swishing it about my mouth, the beer foams up quite a bit. I could easily drink a lot of this, at least until the alcohol caught up with me. It doesn't feel or taste like a 10% ABV beer at all. This is truly a world class beer. Nearly everything about it sets the standard for which quads should be judged. As I said above, Westy 12 is worth all of the praise it gets (but I must agree that there are some beers easier to obtain that come close to its greatness, see St. Bernardus 12), and it deserves your attention. 1,419 charactersToasterChef, Sep 14, 2010

A: The pour is a dark brown color with a sizable tan head and plenty of carbonation.
S: An intense sweetness that comes in the forms of caramel, candi sugar, molasses, and a whole lot of dark fruits. I get some cherries, plums, figs, and dates.
T: The flavor is pretty much more of the same, and that's not a bad thing. A lot of sugary sweetness along with some caramel, molasses, and toffee. There is a strong flavor of dates and figs with some raisins and prunes, too.
M: The body is quite full with that fine carbonation that it seems only the Belgians can pull off.
D: A very, very good beer. Maybe a bit too sweet to drink a lot of at a time, but such a good flavor that you might make a bit of an exception. 750 characterswomencantsail, Sep 13, 2010

A - Pours a deep, dark brown...not at all what I was expecting. Very nice tan head sits atop the beer.
S - caramel, brown sugar, raisins - very complex. Many smells going on here.
T - It's as good as the best amber Belgian I've tried. It's just a tad hot tasting, but not too bad considering it's 12%. Other tastes are caramel, brown sugar....just like the smells.
D - OK - so it's very drinkable. I was super exited to try it. However, I think if it were easier to obtain, it might not hold the position of top beer in the world. Something to be said for having to call the monastery for an appt, hoping you get through, and then picking it up. A treat to try for sure! 760 characterscbak999, Sep 10, 2010

Consumed on my 44th birthday with Father Ian on my deck at Vintage Hills.
Date on the cap is 25.04.13.
Poured from the bottle into tulip glasses. Started at 51 degrees and ended at 54 degrees. 
A: Murky dark brown. I gave a very careful pour to avoid stirring up too much yeast. Tiny, tiny carbonation bubbles formed a one-finger head that dissipated quickly to a thin head that stays on top of the beer and leaves some lacing when drinking. There is still a significant amount of floating material (yeast, I suppose), but it does not detract from the look of the beer.
S: At first, there was virtually no smell from it at all. As soon as it warmed up a few degrees, the nose came to life with caramel and fresh fruit aromas. I really enjoyed just breathing it in deeply.
T: Here I was slightly disappointed. The beer tasted good. There was nothing "off" in the taste- no funkiness at all. There also was not a whole lot going on. Fresh and slightly fruity was all I could get myself convinced of. No specific notes like raisins or those types of things. I have a feeling that this beer was very freshly made and might get some of the more pronounced flavors with some age on it.
M: How in the hell does this beer hide 10.2% alcohol the way it does? The beer has an incredible, creamy mouthfeel and the carbonation is perfect.
D: I am sorry that I was only able to obtain one bottle, because when I took a break from sniffing it, I drank it down way too quickly. 
Overall, this was a very good beer, but I hope maybe someday I will be able to obtain a bottle with some age on it to enjoy more pronounced flavors an aromas. 1,735 charactersSpica66, Sep 10, 2010

This review comes from my first time having the beer with a bottle marked 28.03.10. It pours with a off-white head that goes with time and leaves some waves covering a murky brown body with particles. Alcohol legs on the side of the glass. Amazing aroma of figs, dark fruits, raisins, chocolate, alcohol, brandy and a slightly tart plum. Taste is sweet, lighter than expected with complex, rich and spiciness. There is a complex savory alcohol note on the finish that is beautiful along with a long, clean and pleasant after taste. Brandy, spicy, sweet, yeasty and fruit. There is so much in this beer. It is subtly amazing! Syrupy mouthfeel with really light bubbles. This beer quietly lives up to all expectations. Is it the best beer in the world? Probably not, but it sure is an excellent one. 866 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 09, 2010

1996 vintage.
The beer appears deep burgundy tinged brown with a large frothy beige head. The aroma displays a complex and complimentary sherry-like oxidation quality. This aged iteration is reminiscent of a fine port, with notes of ripe plum and prominent cherries. It's somewhat nutty, with an effusion of caramel, dates, and prunes. The flavor is rich and malty with sherry oxidation and a touch of cardboard, just a touch. Notes of ripe cherries accompany dates, prunes, and a strong caramel profile. The beer is highly carbonated with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel and noticeable alcohol warming. A rare aged treat, thanks! 640 charactersHopHead84, Sep 09, 2010

A September 2006 bottle from a Belgian friend I made on my honeymoon.
A: bottle split 4 ways, but the head still fills the glass. the beer itself is a captivating brown color. very impressive looking beer. I have pictures to prove it!
S: an unreal wave of ripe prunes and figs fills the nostrils. smells kind of like a Christmas cake... complete with marzipan icing. hints of citrus and a toasted nut quality.
T: An unreal beer. taste is very complex. I wish I had the whole bottle to myself!
M: velvety smooth. carbonation is so delicate but also enough to excite the pallet. 
D: This is a beer that makes you want to raise your arms in joy. The best beer in the world? I'm not sure about that, but in my opinion; the best Trappist! 792 charactersuno99, Sep 09, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drank from my Vintage Sint Sixtus Chalice
A - What makes this 5 in appearance is the way the head just stays true and settles into what every beer lover wants and that is a beer that just demands to be consumed, it settles to a uneven surface that you would see on the moon. The colour is a testament to everything beer should be and is mesmerising.
S - Powerful sweet fruits from the bottle. Once poured it's released from it's cage and just plain stinks of roasted sweet fruits and bready yeasts that give of smooth creamy vanilla aromas.
T - The complexity of this brew is astounding. It commands respect and at the same time introduces your palate to a myriad of flavours that actually hypnotises you. The flavours are raisins, bread, chocolate, stewed cherries, dark fruits. It finishes with a lingering zing of intense dark fruits.
M - The incredibly smooth body is just perfectly complimented by low to medium carbonation.
D - This is more than a beer. It is a truly great experience, hype aside this brew is rightfully called the best beer in the world. Everything about this beer says exquisite. No RIS can express a subtle domination of your senses as this beer can. In it's subtleties it's power leaves you seriously impressed.
There are very few beers that one feels privalidged to drink. This is one of them. The fact that it is made by reel monks for love, warms the heart. For me Russian Imperial Stouts are plentyfull and some even delectable. What makes the Quadrupel superior is the way the subtleness is balanced by sheer power and flavour, this is at the top of the tree in Quads and therefore rightly sits as the best beer in the World. I have been lucky enough to try Big DIPA's and massive Imperial Stouts. This trumps them all.

Drank from my 1960's St Sixtus Vintage chalice
A - Pours a deep Mahogany colour with the classic foamy head that does not move at all, and laces all the way down the glass.
S - Oh sweet lord, I don't think it gets better than the aromas displayed by this beer.
T - The flavours have nicely balanced out with the brown sugar subsiding to let the dark fruits be more prominent. The alcohol is still sublimely hidden and the complexity is still unbelievable.
M - Medium to full body with low to medium carbonation.
O - This beer does get a lot better with age. The port like flavours begin to emerge at three years old. I will review again in a couple of years time. This beer cannot be beaten. I know some people are dissapointed when they first tsate this beer because they are used to massive bourbon barrel aged stouts that are dominated by a particular flavour or two. This beer challenges the need for massive flavours by taking you on a journey of subtleness and balance. That for me is the pinnacle of brewing. 2,819 characterseric5bellies, Sep 08, 2010

A: It pours into my Chimay goblet a cloudy dark amber/brown color. With one finger of tight, spotty, off white head that remains for some time. As I slowly drink it down, persistent lacing covers the side of the glass
A: The floral Belgian yeast is noticeable immediately. Followed by some caramel malt aroma, and dark fruits. Notably, raisins, figs and plums.
T: The flavors here are so complex that it is hard for me to discern, break down and describe the individual flavors. What a wonderful yeast strain used here. The flavors of the dark fruits do come through nicely. The plums and raisins blend effortlessly with the flavors from the malt and yeast. This is possibly the most well balanced beer that I have ever had. No one flavor really jumps out apart from the rest. Everything just blends together perfectly.
M: Fairly highly carbonated. More than I was expecting actually. None the less, this is no detractor here. It has a wonderful smooth, medium body on the palette.
D: The alcohol is nearly unoticeable at first, but comes out a bit as the beer warms. I could literally drink this every day and never get tired of it. It really is too bad that alas, I only have one bottle. This is the very definition of a world class beer. I will certainly be seeking out more of it. 1,352 charactersCaptinRedBeard, Sep 07, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5So it's my second Westy of any strength (had the blonde at a recent tasting, thanks colforbin), really nice beer, appearance is fine, just hard to be "exceptional" in appearance, unless you put a meringue head on a bmc (sorry that's from a recent Duvel thread and made me laugh). Actually I am going to bump up the appearance score a tad for the dramatic difference between the dark liquid and the white head, which my homebrewed attempt lacked (its head was brown).
Smell is oh so complex, lots of dried fruits, malt, subdued hops on the nose, sweet malt; taste is similarly full and complex, lots of sweetness yet not cloying in the least, sort of just what I expected and have aimed for in my homebrewed imitation. Real nice bittering hop on the finish. Mouthfeel, see taste, not thin but never thick and at this ABV that's the magic. Drinkability, I thought about a 5 here but that would be totally adjusting for ABV, a 4.5 is still fair. 
Other note, slight hints of oxidation, this bottle is roughly 5-6 months old, this seems like a beer where oxidation will not be a big detriment at all. Going to open my homebrewed W12 attempt, about 9 months old now, may revisit this review if that opens new insights.
Opened the homebrewed version, makes me appreciate the real thing much more, the homebrew is actually less sweet but more oxidized, darker color and especially darker head. Loving the original. 1,410 charactersGilmango, Sep 06, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A huge thanks to Chris for the generous trade of Westvleteren.
A plain 33cl brown bottle with a slim neck topped with a black and gold cap. Dated 25.08.12
Holding the bottle up to the window, I can already see that it has excellent clarity and just a tiny bit of sediment at the bottom.
The cap opens with a loud hiss. I pour it slowly down the side of the goblet glass but a huge rocky head forms anyway. Even leaving the last dregs in the bottle, the oversized glass is complete filled - half glorius beer, half thick linen colored head. I'm starting to wonder if it will ever settle. Chunky lace is left behind as it starts to give up the fight.
Westy 12 is a perfect ruby red color when the light hits it. Surprisingly good clarity but that's probably due to having plenty of time to settle in my basement. The bubbles continue to cascade up through the beer from the etched bottom of this glass. What a sight.
The aroma is distinct and special in it's own right. While familiar to a Belgian beer lover, it seems to have a little something special - that unique trappist yeast. It's like a warm wheat bread dough being proofed. Dark cherries, raisins, plum pudding, and fruit cake all mingling in my nose.
The flavor is equally wonderful and complex. The first sip dances across my tongue and has such incredible nuance and depth that it seems to linger well after. The taste is much like the aroma with all sorts of fantastic dark fruit both sweet and a little tart. There is bread and chocolate as I roll it around my mouth. What a great combination of flavors! The yeast imparts a flavor that isn't funky or sour but somewhere in between and very mild.
The mouthfeel is suprisingly light in body with perfectly judged carbonation for the style. It's smooth but the alcohol begins to warm on its way down. Otherwise, I don't know if I would ever know it's over 10%. A beer this strong and full of complex flavors has no right being so easy to drink.
Overall just an amazing beer! Looking over my review, I realize I'm running out of adjectives to describe how great it is. Worthy of the accolades and praise. The most wonderful, special, and unique beer in the world. Period. 2,189 charactersGilGarp, Sep 04, 2010

Looks: absorbing. The beer pours a cloudy dark amber, opaque, with hues of maroon and orange shimmering throughout. The head is fleeting - a rosy tan that becomes a quick ring and film, but leaves some mountainous craggy horizontal lace. 
Smells: crazy! Lots of flavors swirling about that I can't decipher. I do pick up brown sugar, molasses, ginger bread, graham crackers, fig, cinnamon and some light maple syrup. Each whiff reveals something new. It's exquisite. 
Tastes: just like it smells -- complex and crazy-time good. There's some inviting spiciness, with peppery flavors of coriander, cardamom, saffron and rye. Sweet figs, caramel, cinnamon, brown sugar and sweet dark molasses dance in the sweet finish. 
Feels: velvety. Subtly carbonated, with a medium-full body and a delightful smoothness. The alcohol is noticeable but not distracting. Everything here's perfectly in tune. 
Drinks: incredibly. While I want to really wait it out and savor it, the beer goes down so easily it's scary. The complexity brings something new and exciting to each sip. Twelve's renown is indeed deserved. 1,213 charactersPhelps, Sep 03, 2010

MF: Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Full, but just a tad light on the carbonation.
D: Drinkability is excellent, and I'm getting a little sad that this brew is almost gone =(
Overall, Westvleteren 12 is worth it's praise, however I still hold Rochefort 10 as it's superior. 706 charactersTKEbeerman, Sep 01, 2010

4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5Fresh bottle from the monastery, poured into a Westy chalice. I've had this a couple times before, but it always feels special to open one of these up. 
Appearance is a medium-dark brown color with a billowing off-white head. Some yeast floaties, as per usual, but the beer itself has great clarity. The cap never completely recedes, and a swirl brings it back in force. 
Smell is classic Belgian quad. A glassful of dried dark fruits, plums, raisins, prunes. A hint of banana, rum, vanilla, spice, and yeasty notes. The nose is outstanding and one of the more complex you'll find. It's in perfect balance, no aroma dominating whatsoever, all in good harmony. 
Taste follows the nose in almost all respects. Dark fruit, rum, banana, and spicy components. The alcohol is barely perceptible. This is one of the best beers ever with respect to hiding its alcohol content.
Mouthfeel, I have to dock it just a little bit. At the start of the pour, it's just a bit too vigorous with the carbonation, providing more of a sharp bite than the creaminess that I would expect from this style. However, by the end of the bottle, it had rounded out nicely. I've had an aged bottle before, and I seem to remember that the level of carbonation was greatly superior, with a silky quality that is unrivaled by other beers.
Drinkability is outstanding. So amazingly easy to drink. This beer is dangerous.
I think that I will age most or all of my remaining bottles. This is a great beer, no doubt, but I have had it when it's been better. I do have two 7-year-old bottles sitting at home, maybe I will try one of them soon and refresh my memory how it ages. Regardless, fresh or not, this beer truly is great. 1,697 charactersdavod23, Aug 30, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5At long last, through the selfless actions of a true advocate, the holy grail is here. I am going to do my best at giving this beer a fair shot; its difficult to not ride the wave of hype surrounding this beer. It is even more difficult when the beer certainly lives up to everything that is said about it. 
(As a quick side note: I received this beer about 32 hours ago after being flown accross the Atlantic. I immediately put it into the fridge, I figured that over 30 hours in a fridge was enough to let things settle down a bit. I have another bottle that I am saving for a few months, or years, so if I am doing the beer any injustice by reviewing it so soon, I will correct later.)
Westvleteren 12 is a mahogany colored brew with a finger's worth of head. The lace sticks to the glass for several seconds as a solid mass, then breaks suddenly. This leaves a thick ring of beige clinging for its life. I have never seen lace break so quickly, its as though some silent whistle blew, and the huddle broke to approach the line of scrimmage. The pour is pretty clear, any murkiness present I am attributing to my impatience (see above.)
The smell and taste are as close to perfection as my senses are able of detecting (then again, I am neither a supersmeller or taster) So many components floating around. There is a definite raisin or plum note. The first sniff gives me some slightly burnt toffee, a touch of smoke (?), coriander, and just a hint of warm booziness. The taste follows the smell, starting sweet and caramel-like, before coming to an almost tart fruitiness, think green apple, and then melting away to a little warming alcohol. The booze plays well, the flavors melding together just enough to mingle without either making it stand out, or covering it completely. Wow, as I mentioned earlier, I am doing my best to give this beer a fair review, I am just having much trouble finding faults. The complexity is awe-inspiring. As a homebrewer, I feel I really have tasted the holy grail, knowing the amount of work that goes into even mediocre beers...I cannot imagine the care that has went into this beer over the generations. 
The mouthfeel leaves me unable to criticize...highly carbonated, starts off thick and chewy, but finishes dry, with just a hint of caramel sticking to the tongue, begging you to take another sip. I cannot think of anything I would change. The bitterness is there, the booze is there, but everything in just the right measure.
Drinking this beer is an experience to say the least, it almost transports you to some medieval monastery, where monks in tattered robes stand around wood-fired copper kettles, stirring and sampling with large wooden oars. Highly recommended, worth the time spent salivating, excellence. Thank you again to the BA who put this into my hands, thank you from the bottom of a well enjoyed glass. 2,870 charactersgrayburn, Aug 29, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was lucky enough to score this twice. Once with my bed and breakfast owner in Bruges, and once at a bar in Amsterdam, both in June. It was unreal to get my paws on it. The second time I had it, it was aged 3 years, and it made it a little more smooth, but it is just a terrific taste. 
It was like a thick texture yet soft feel. I was creamy but not the same like a Guinness. I am caught up in the hype and think this is the best beer in the world. It has carbonation, but not too much. It has a toffee type taste, yet some hints of fruit. 
The aftertaste is great. The alcohol was masked wonderfully.

A: poured (chill haze), dark armber, thin foamy light tan head, slow dissipation with excellent lacing.

F: Toffee, tropical fruit : melon, caramel malt. Flavors are perfectly complementory
M: Light in mouthfeel and body, finishes light on the palate, almost like a 'whispering finish' / medium carbonation. Drinks very smooth on the palate. No alcohol warmth.
O: To be a quad, I think this needed a little more oomph. Not as viscous as I would have thought a quad to resemble to style, but yet still delicious. 618 charactersadkirkish, Aug 28, 2010

Also, my 35th review.
12 oz. bottle poured into Caracole tulip.
A: Pours a beautiful opaque-mahogany with a 3 finger mocha head that will not die; creamy head stays throughout the entire beer. I've never seen anything like this.
S: Fruit; this doesn't smell like beer at all. Fresh elderberry jam, black mission figs and a hint of heat. Quite possibly the most "delicious" smelling beer I've ever had the pleasure of sitting in front of.
T: Holy hell; it's all true. I think the closest thing I've ever had to this is St. Bernardus Abt. 12 in terms of flavor; sweet, fairly boozy, and heavy on the dark fruits. Caramel, brown sugar - this is just awesome.
M: Feels literally like silk on the tongue, with nice carbonation and a medium-thick viscosity.
D: I don't feel as if I'd be a proper BA if I was to give this a 5 for drinkability. Is it incredible? Yes, but it's also 10.2%, which of course means that it's quite sweet. Add to that the fact that drinking more than one of these is usually not an option for us state-siders, and it becomes clear that this is a rare treat more than anything else. Honestly, I wouldn't want it to be anything else.
Worth the hype; this will not be my last encounter with this beer. I will sleep well this evening.
Edit: Forgot to mention; gave my girlfriend the first sip. Her reaction?

4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Picked up at the monastery and stamped 16.06.13. This beer pours dark brown with a little amber on the edges of the glass. It started with about an inch of head and reduced to about a quarter inch that stays with the beer throughout. The smell starts with the malt with a hint of something sweet and is followed by the yeast and something that can only be described as slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel is that of some carbonation and a nice warmth. The alcohol is well masked. It seems slightly sticky like sugar. The taste follows the smell with a sweetness and slight fruit taste. I really enjoyed this beer and would be very happy drinking it everyday. 655 charactersjlmarshall, Aug 26, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to many BAs for sharing, most recently GOGRANDE and Spycow.
A - It pours a rich plum-mahogany hue; translucent, though the shade is dark enough to prevent much light from passing through. A short-lived ivory head gives way to migrating wisps of froth, leaving a few substantial swaths of rocky lace on the chalice.
S - The aroma is so multifaceted and dynamic that it is nearly akin to perusing a gourmet market. At times the aroma is more nutty, at other times more raisin-y, notes of maraschino cherry appear and then segue into impressions of mejool dates, Concord grape, blueberry bushes, hazelnut, honey, and a variety of cognacs, fruit brandies, sherries and port wines. Perhaps there is a hint of a woody-earthy spiciness too.
T - This stuff is amazing; the intensity of flavor is superb and astounding. It's all it is cracked up to be. The taste is full, rich and beautifully balanced. I am initially getting sublimely sweet Concord grape and rich date flavors, coupled with nuances of earthy hazelnut, chocolate covered cherries, fruit brandies and cognac. I am particularly impressed by the sublimely tempered booze. Actually, I am particularly impressed by every aspect of this brew. As it airs out, I get an additional plethora of tastes including clove-nutmeg spiciness, dark bread, dark fruit, papaya, more concord grape, Curacao, anise... What an outstanding libation. Truly some other-level stuff.
M - Nectar-like; expansively creamy, softly and persistently carbonated, lighter in body but still tremendously substantial, totally enhancing.
D - Off the charts. This is as good as the best beer I have ever had. 1,639 charactersktrillionaire, Aug 24, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Much love to Shyne for the trade!
Poured into a snifter: About a finger of beige head that dissipates & leaves a wisp across the surface & a loose, bubbly collar. Body is deep ruby amber, hazy, with a few tiny strands of nucleation. 
Dark, stewing fruits are up front in the nose: prunes, raisins, even some slightly tart cherries & sweet wine grapes. There's an herbal quality here that reminds me of Orval, even a little floral. Nose evolves subtly with each whiff, into mild baking spices (cinnamon, nutmeg) to hints of cocoa. The smell is more restrained & not very intense, but complex & pleasing.
Significant herbal flavors at play in the flavor, followed by a vinous sweetness, sweet baked dough, a little hot cinnamon, & drying out near the finish. Ends with a subtle alcoholic jab, then unrolls into a long aftertaste that moves through candied fruits, menthol, even a tiny bit of smokiness. I love a beer with a "second act" after each sip. 
Velvety smooth with just a little prick from alcohol. There's some heat, then the cool menthol-like quality. Rolls around on the tongue, this has such a great mouthfeel. Full-bodied but somehow light & airy as well.
This really defied my expectations. What I anticipated was a big, bold flavor profile, this is all about finesse. So complex, but not a slap in the face -- there are a lot of subtle notes & movements, & none of them overpower the others. Well-balanced, silky smooth, & flavorful, this is a great beer. 1,474 charactersOneDropSoup, Aug 22, 2010

Big thanks to Chris from The Blue Dog for sharing his case of Westy 12. Thanks to him I was able to try what many consider the #1 beer in the world. 
A super slow pour produced about a 4 finger head. The beer is a murky brown iced tea color with a huge fluffy beige head that's going nowhere anytime soon. 
The nose is lots of spice, lots of sticky dark fruits, figs, raisin, plums and sugary molasses. A bit of alcohol also. 
Flavor is just like the nose. The dark fruits, the spice and caramel and candied figs go along nicely with the Belgian yeast. 
The mouthfeel is where this thing really shine. Light and fluffy, smooth and creamy and oh so soft on the palate. Very impressive. 
Best beer in the world? In my opinion no. But I can definitely see why it gets all the accolades it does. It's an amazing beer and would love to drink as much of this as possible.

4.54/5  rDev -1.5%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a dark chestnut color with a moderate eggshell head - it hung around decently, but didn't provide any lacing. Nothing special in the looks department.
The aroma actually presented a bit of a challenge for me - I had difficulty picking out the individual notes. There's the yeast, along with some clove and then a fairly sweet, light fruit aroma. The taste didn't provide much more clarity - but it was sure delicious. Surprisingly sweet - much moreso than I expected. A fairly light flavor for a quad - sweet, brown sugar, honey, light fruit, toffee, a bit biscuity.
Mouthfeel was good. Appropriate carbonation.
Honestly, I read some of the descriptions in other reviews, and I my experience seems significantly different from what others are describing. This was a fairly light-tasting, sweet experience for me. I guess my palate has even farther to go than I realized.
Regardless, this thing was absolutely delicious - I could drink this all day. 958 charactersMavajo, Aug 16, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from it's signature unmarked bottle into my Westy chalice.
A: Dark copper to brown in color, slightly cloudy, with an eggshell colored head that does not want to go away. Lacing is excellent.
S: Insane aromas of brown sugar, spice, fig, dried dark fruits, and toast. Hops are not prominent on the nose, but still noticeable.
T: Wow! Much like the aroma. Dough, sugar, spice, raisin, prune, fig. You name it, it's there! Alcohol lends a slight warming sensation, but less than would be expected. The finish is somewhat dry, with slight hop notes lingering.
M: Full bodied, and has a mouthfeel unlike any other beer I have ever tried. This is liquid silk.
D: I can see what the hype is about. Westy 12 is near perfect. Extremely easy to drink. This may be the best beer of any style that I have ever had the opportunity to try. 837 charactersWYVYRN527, Aug 15, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to GOGRANDE for this offering.
A date of 27.10.12 on the cap.
Pours into a Chimay Chalice a muddy brown color with all kinds of sediment suspended about. The head is about a finger thick, tan in color and so thick you could cut it with a knife. Lacing? Plenty.
To be honest, the nose is rather faint. Picking up some lightly roasted malt, milk chocolate and some light fruitiness. Maybe it needs to warm even more, but right now, I smell nothing special.
Okay, so the nose isn't that great. Well, the taste more than makes up for it! Where to begin? There is no one thing that just pops out, it is really unexplainable. Just a complex meshing of roasty malt, malted milk balls, chocolate, nougat, rum and dark fruit such as dates. I cannot do this justice. The alcohol is there, but it's not showing that the beer is over ten percent in any way. The finish is so pleasant and clean. Just amazing.
Mouthfeel is like a milk spongebath on palate. Full bodied, thick, rich, and creamy velvet. Amazing again.
It's crazy how well this beer drinks. I am honored to have tried it and have to say it is every bit as good as anyone has ever said. Amazing, amazing, amazing. There will soon come a time where I will NEED to have this again. 1,246 charactersjera1350, Aug 14, 2010
4.46/5  rDev -3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Wow, i had this one sitting down in my holding for about a year before tonight, which is the night before my wedding, and with it being on reserve for a special purpose it did not dissapoint. 2 bottles, one each for my Best Man and I, poured at 45ish and sipped until warmed to room temp.
From the initial pour, perfect. great head retention. i just want to stick my nose in the head it's so frothy, like a properly foamed cappachino. a dark sandy brown color, a bit lighter color then expected, not a wrong color just not what my brain had in mind, stunning. 
Nose is great but a little subdued overall. There is a nice fruity alcohol i pick out that smells great however.
Amazing in this field, strongly reminds me of Pannepot Grand Reserve, but with more depth to it overall. I think the strong spice like presence brings alot of the resemblance, but this one goes deeper into the territory of dark fruity flavors, and warming alcohol. The yeast also pokes through more and you can get some baked bready flavors,and a nice earthy and mineral esqe facet. For this beer, i really liked drinking about 8oz, then drinking the last 4oz with the yeast poured in to see how it added to the beer. I'm sure with every bottle opened something new would present itself, 12oz is simply not enough to explore such a complex beer to the extent of it's depth.
i had to stop for a bit to think about how exactly to rate this ones drinkability....i had no desire, at any point, to take more then a sip. i have been repeatedly pouring this into a 4oz sample snifter actually. nothing more is needed. a beer that can make 12oz fulfill such an amount of time and be so complex yet still be easy to drink, perfect.

4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The moment of truth has arrived! Exponential thanks to BeerThursdays for hooking me up.
33cl bottle into oversized wine glass. Best-by date 24.09.11 (therefore bottled Sept. 08).
A: I was carful as to how I pried the cap off this beer because I wanted to save it. To my surprise, as I started to pry carefully around the lid, I released the slightest amount of pressure with a "pfffft" which then quickly became a forceful fountain of foam. I did not lose much more than an ounce or two since the cap was basically still on, but that was an ounce or two too mcuh for this beer. I quickly pried the rest of the cap off and poured the dark mahogany-chestnut colored liquid into my glass. A small amount of fine sediment came out as well and settled on the bottom. The light tan head was not as ample as expected (probably due to the spill), but it was thick and impressive none the less. A fuzzy film stayed on top of the beer the whole way through and left some faint rings of thin, sticky lace down the glass.
S: Beautiful soft aroma. Not as strong smelling as I was expecting, but so very lovely. There is an overall yeasty, buscuity, and woody quality to the scent, with sweeter notes of prunes, black figs, raisins, coco and caramel malt. Not very spicy. Earthy and vinous scents along with a faint hint of alcohol come through as well.
T: Incredibly smooth and complex. I'm glad I've tried Rochefort 10 so that I have something similar to compare this to. Not since that beer have I had anything this soft, complex and smooth. It is similar, but better. My unworthy palate picks out notes of prunes, red grapes, oak, caramel malt, dried cherries, leather and coco. There is an overall mustiness like an old damp basement. Finish is full of raisins, coco and a slight funk. Aftertaste can be described as a mixture of berries and toasted marshmallows. After-aftertaste is similar to the aftertaste of smoking a fine cigar, but not as potent. It reminds me of tobacco though. 
M: Very fine carbonation that hits the tongue sharp at first and then melts into the full body of this beer. Silky soft mouthfeel with a dry finish makes me wish I had a lot more of this beer left in my glass. Alcohol is lightly present but well intergraded into the flavors. For a beer that is over 10%, the alcohol is actually handled extremely well.
D: It's beers like this that make you really appreciate what can be done with beer as a beverage and as an art form if produced in the right hands. Every beer that I have in the next couple days will be just a little bit less enjoyable because of this experience. I hate to give this beer so much praise, and part of me was expecting to be let down since there is so much legend surrounding it. But honestly, I can see how this is the top beer in the world. I wouldn't say it's my favorite beer, but world class, yes, and definitely worthy to be one of the top five beers ever made.

A: Reddish brown mahogany, it poured with a creamy thin head that sticks.
S: Raisins, molasses, rum alcohol, leafy/moldy hops, a particular sweetness like cinnamon bread, slight cranberry walnut. Pleasant is an understatement.
T: Stick sweet, like a cinnabon with subtle raisin and dried fruit, cherry/cranberry, rummy alcohol with hops that are sharper than expected, which linger on the front while a musty leafy sweetness slowly fades.

330ml capped bottle poured into a vintage Abbij St. Sixtus goblet
The Cap is stamped with a 19/09/10 date, meaning this beer will be 3 years old this September 19th. 
I let it warm to 50° before I opened the bottle. It opened with a "hiss" and poured a deep dark cloudy brown with a one finger tan head on a slow easy pour. The head leaves a nice thin lace on the glass. 
The nose was sweet with hints of dried fruit (raisins/plums), licorice, chocolate and bit of alcohol . 
The taste is of caramel, dried raisins, prunes, vanilla, sweet candy (is that licorice again) and a hint of cherries. 
The mouth-feel is of medium creamy feel with a nice pleasant warmth from the 10.2% abv. 
This is a very drinkable brew and I'm going to be heading to my fridge for an encore. 956 charactersuturn, Aug 10, 2010

I thought to myself... after the day I had, what would top it off? The sole Westy 12 I've ever had! BIG thanks go out to Prufrock for putting this in as an extra in the Blind Beers BIF. Poured into my lovely brandy snifter and reviewed on the spot for all to enjoy.
Vision
The moment I began gently pouring this acclaimed brew into my glass I had the sudden urge to scream out "Carbonation ho!" It is extreme the amount of head that gushed forth from a gentle pour. Easily a finger and a half of pure white foam that absorbs the hues from the liquid below. In fact there is a two tier system of bubbles here. One is a gentle brown fading quickly to wedding gown white. You'd think that the body would share a similar coloration as it gives off, but this is not true.
The body is burgundy melted into ruby red. It reminds me of unfiltered apple cider. You want to call it brown and red at the same time. Brick red isn't right, but it isn't muddy clay either. It is dark enough that light fails to penetrate far into the center. It gets just enough in to divulge the secrets of carbonation, but no further.
This beer is like every other Belgian I have had, fizzier than a pop drink on a warm day. I do not despise this. I look forward to it, actually! Without this, I would have been disappointed, to be quite frank.
After a few minutes, almost all the head is gone except for a nice island of bubbles that is constantly regenerated by the endless supply from below.
Bouquet
Caramel tones sneak by under the stadium-sized apple presence. If I grabbed a truck full of apples, mashed them, and laid them bare into my front room I doubt it could even match the intensity that enters my nostrils. I can actually taste the tartness through my nose. It is strong in bitterness ( Not acetic, but can't tell ) but the strong fruit sweetens the deal to make it quite enjoyable. The ending breath whispers a bready note, but I'm almost positive I'm lying to myself. I wish there were more complexities to note, but maybe I am missing them currently.
Flavor Profile
The very first sip is like a journey from high noon into the depths of a cave. I can only start off by proclaiming this is where the complexities lie. 
The entrance-way of this spelunking trip is instantly tart with a good amount of sweetness. It is there not to be a player, but the walkway with which I can traverse between rooms. Without it, there is an overwhelming uncomfortable bitterness instead of tart. That is not the case, thank goodness.
My very first steps ring out with the noise of fruits, tart nature, and crisp flavors. I stand still for a moment and the echo kicks me in the tongue. The finish is falsely clean, because not more than five seconds later I can taste bananas on the back of my tongue. A new challenger squishes its medicinal head free of the at once mildly sweet flavor and drenches me in what can only be a disinfecting alcohol. 
These same flavors find new ways to meander around depending on how I sip this. Letting it rest for much longer than previous sips reveals a new layer. It grows crisp little legs that tickle relentlessly all over my tasting centers. Apples, tart notes, and bananas once again but if I let it sit too long, it feels like a giant jackhammer stabs through all flavors and prickles with an intense desire to burn, to own all locations. The alcohol reminds me of every stereotypical tourist flashing his camera endlessly to the point where it is a violent weapon. I enjoy this assault, but maybe because it is a new experience. 
Oral Sensations
The body is exactly as it should be. I mean it. This is perfect for this beer. There needs to be no increase or decrease in how it feels flowing in my glass or in my mouth. It is both creamy and crisp. Both tingly and smooth. It has enough presence to linger, but it goes home exactly when it should. 
Even though the alcohol is the flock of bats inhabiting this cave, I find it only warming my throat and no where else. It did not light a fire in the pits of my stomach even after halfway through. It is almost a contradiction in this way.
Conclusions
This sneaky little beer, both in its alcohol content and flavors, proves to be quite easy to enjoy. I wanted to hate it. I looked for things to down grade it on. I wish I could treat this with rougher hands, but it is what it is. I truly enjoyed this beer. It not only was a pleasure to enjoy, but I anxiously await another. I could have two in an evening and be satisfied. 
The flavors keep coming back in interesting ways, and I do not grow to despise them. I welcome them like an oil lantern after my flashlight lost power. 4,730 charactersKhazadum, Aug 08, 2010

A - Pours an awesome mahogany color witha nice .5 inch head that is off-white and very active and dense. Very attractive beer. Head retention is nice and it is reduced to a nice thin mat. 
S - Starts nice and spicy, with some cinnamon and some cloves. Also sweet and malty with some nice bread aromas. Some vanilla, mild vinous character, raisins and also some nice phenols and yeast. Some mild citrus character as well maybe lemons. Absolutely delicious.
T & M - Starts off smooth with a great bready flavor. Then nice sweet malt with cinnamon and many spices. Very malt heavy beer with a greta full body. Fluffy and smooth all at the same time. Some vinous character, nice phenols and spices complement and are perfectly balanced with nice bready malt. Some vanilla and a nice alcoholic sweetness that is very much noticeable but not overwhelming. There is actually some nice dry hop-like character at the end but a great malty sweet aftertaste.
D - Delicious and everything that is expected of a beer of this caliber. ABV is high so its not a perfect 5. 1,136 charactersJoEBoBpr, Aug 06, 2010

Pours a deep dark brown with an off-white two finger head with a dusting of brown sediment on the top. Maintains phenomenal lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of fruit, bread, alcohol, and malt. The flavor is of malt, bananas, alcohol, biscuits, citrus, and bread. It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is excellent in all aspects. The complexity of this one is truly INSANE. The appearance is awesome as well. This one sample makes me want to book a flight to Belgium and drink more... The hype is true. 653 charactersthagr81us, Jul 31, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I always assumed If I has the opportunity to try this I would have to kill three men and give away the rights to my first born to do so. Luckily for my future generations a beer bud of mine took a trip to belgium and surprised me with a bottle. 
Pours a murky dark walnut in color with very little light coming through. The head is thick and bright white leaving some awesome lacing. The smell is a bit subtle for what i was expecting but the amount of scents fuzed into a singe whiff is astounding, dried fruits cinnamon yeast spices and a bunch of other things I cant even put my finger on. The taste is more complex then the smell but also subtle. Raisins the slightest citrus note cloves and a warm tasty booze dominates for me. The mouthfeel is not heavy at all but you know its there and the drinkability is through the roof. Not that anyone would want to but you could put a few of these down in a hurry if you had to. This is hands down the best Quad I have ever had, I don't know if it would be the all time best for my taste but I would never argue this being the holy grail. 1,086 charactersdickieb, Jul 30, 2010

11.2 oz. bottle poured into a Westvleteren goblet (of course). Bottled at the abbey in May or early June 2010.
The nose is fantastic. I must have spent several minutes just taking the aroma in before my first sip. I love Rochefort 10, but this one takes it up a notch - marvelous velvet brown complexity as it comes up in temp. Tasty wee bits of sediment floating around without a care in the world. I wish I could have enjoyed you all day, but all good things must come to the end of the bottle and into my belly. 
This beer is worth the hype and is a must have on any beer lover's Bucket List of fine beers. Thank you monks, you hath done well. 747 charactersElGallo, Jul 27, 2010

Smell: Sublime, fruity esters, more intense then the 10
Taste: Wonderful, belgian flavors, esters, fruits hit with bubbles and alchohols. An amazing flavor, trying to quantify it wouldn't do it justice.
M & D: perfectly balanced even after a cross atlantic journey, refreshing and filling.
I'd drink this every day, I liked the 10 a bit better, but my friends who I shared these with all liked this better, but we're talking 1 sub A, and 1 sub B here. Amazing for the style. 624 charactersDonerik, Jul 26, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Courtesy of a trade with digita7693 
I had this "young" with a 2013 "best by" date. 12-oz bottle poured into a chalice. Poured a ruddy-red tinged, dark brown. A moderately aggressive pour yielded a huge three-finger white head. It settled to 1/2' which lasted throughout. I sipped this beer and there was that fluffy head at the very last sip. The nose was coffee, caramel, plums, lemon, clove, and chocolate. The taste? My goodness...dark, sweet fruit (plums, grapes) with some chocolate at the start and some spices. Belgian (bready) yeasts were evident. The finish moved to dry and even a little bitter, providing a wonderful, complex and balanced evolution. Mouthfeel was thick without being syrupy. Carbonation was surprisingly high, but seemed to fit. It's hard not to gush but this is just an amazing beer. I wanted to find fault with it but could not. Nothing in this review does it justice because it is the subtleties that make it special, and most of them defy description. It is NOT over-rated. You MUST have this. 1,026 charactersregspeir, Jul 25, 2010

Pours a little murky, medium brown with a lot of carb., off-white head. Smells are dark fruits, a lot of yeast, slight funk and a hint of booze, smells really great. Taste some dark fruits, figs, a lot of yeast, slight funk again, a touch of hops and grapeskin. Mouthfeel is perfect amount of carb., smooth, feels great. Drinkability is very good, I understand why everyone wants to try this beer. Is this the greatest beer I've ever had? No, but it is definitely a great one, and one I would love to drink again. Soon. Very soon. 658 charactersLukafer, Jul 24, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5HUGE thank-you to frissianwits for this one...the generosity blew me away.
Presentation: Classic Westy 330ml brown pop top with no label; cap says 27.05.13
Appearance: Murky walnut beer with a light beige cap with good retention. 
Smell: Spicy, sweet, and beguiling...there are a host of different spices here, but everything is so well-integrated I'm having a tough time pulling them all out...I do get a definite hit of cinnamon sugar, however. There's lots of fruit as well, and more light fruit (apricot, maybe?) than I was expecting...some very light booze as well, and I'm getting sugared dates now as this warms a bit.
Taste: This courses across the palate, constantly changing and showing a new side. It starts out with burnt caramel, toasty malts (like an amped-up Munich Dunkel), some light minerality, and some dark fruit...cotton candy makes its presence known as well, as well as various sweet baking spices...there's a bit more bitterness than I was expecting, though there's no real hop flavor. The bitterness is actually just a bit stronger than I'd like. Eventually apple and other light fruit make their way forward, as well as mild alcohol as this warms. In a word, complex.
Mouthfeel: Fairly high carbonation levels, but remarkably light for the high abv, which keeps the drinkability...
Drinkability: High...though it's so complex, it begs to be mused over...so complex you just want another taste, and it'd be easy to drink more than the 1-2 of these that you could have without starting to get goofy
Conclusion: Was it the earth-shattering, worldview-changing epiphany I was awaiting? No. But I don't think a beer that's this hyped could *ever* meet expectations. That being said, it was by FAR the best Belgian Strong Dark Ale/Quadrupel I've ever had. I think if the bitterness had been just slightly less, this would have been an A+. Better than Chimay's Blue and Rochefort's 10 w/out question (though those are both delicious beers; I haven't tried Achel's Extra yet, so I can't comment on it). I would love (someday) to have 3-4 of these so I could drink 1 a year or so and see how they change. I broke this open to celebrate passing my MA defense that day; again, thanks to frissianwits, I cannot think of a better way to have celebrated. 2,273 charactersBedetheVenerable, Jul 20, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Drank in Brussels on my recent trip around Europe. Found a package at De Bier Tempel that included one 12, one 8, two blondes, and a glass.
Pours into the Westy glass as a dark, ruby-tinged brown with an extremely persistent beige head (seemed to last the entire time I was drinking the beer).
Aroma was very nice, though could have been slightly stronger. Brown sugar, molasses, spicy clove/yeast. A touch of dark fruit, maybe even some citrus.
Taste is pretty amazing. Chocolate was the first thing I noticed, then brown sugar, caramel, and sweet, cherry-like molasses. A hint of something medicinal, then a slight earthiness came in as the beer progressed towards a mildly bitter finish to balance it out. Not a hint of alcohol. Just awesome.
Smooth, full-bodied mouthfeel with enough carbonation. 
Overall, this compares closely to the other favourite quads (Rochefort, St. Bernardus, etc.), but the thing that elevates it just above is the drinkability. Considering my bottle was quite fresh, I was very surprised how little alcohol I could detect.
Can't say whether or not it's the best beer I've ever tried, but it certainly ranks in the top few. 1,159 charactersnotdan, Jul 17, 2010

The taste is very complex and almost indescribable. Three of us shared one that I brought back to the states. Each of us had different impressions. It has hints of spice, sweetness, caramel, and very rich mouthfeel. Even my wife, who does not like any beers other than lambics and flanders red, really liked it a lot. I guess I should not have let her taste it. Less for me. 495 charactersherbg, Jul 12, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is my 25th review on BA. I was fortunate to have this Belgian Quad at a perfect summer afternoon pool party & cookout at Zombob's. He was kind enough to share his only bottle of Westy 12 that he acquired during his European vacation. His family was able to visit the Abbey during their trip.
We are all excited to pop open the planets best beer and indulge. The bottle is perfectly chilled in my cooler as Bob brings out the Westvleteren tasting glasses. We open the single bottle and portion between the glasses. An awesome creamy head sits on top of the clear brown nectar. The smell is sweet and fresh. Smells like the freshest of bakery bread. A light spicy aroma also comes through. This first sip is wonderfully balanced between honey, light malt, and spice. It is so easy to drink that we actually finish the beer too soon in my opinion. It would have been nice to allow it to warm and get the full aroma and subtle flavors. The heavy alcohol is well hidden; but I soon find out it's full potency - as we had several other beers prior to the Westy. The smoothness of this beer is incredible.
This was a real treat to enjoy and review this unique beer. There is so much mystique behind this plain brown bottle with the gold cap. I can only imagine what it would have been to enjoy all three styles at Sint-Sixtus Abbey. I appreciate the generosity of our friends wanting to share this awesome beer with us. Thanks Zombob! 1,434 charactershonestdave, Jul 11, 2010
4.39/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Tasting the legend at last. The beer out of the unassuming bottle is likewise humble in appearance, being generally raisin-colored and surprisingly not overly dark, but there is an inviting, creamy head that quietly disappears to a thin cap that lasts for the duration.
The aroma is truly unique and alluring. Initial scents of fresh, juicy grapes turn to raisins, prunes, and yeast that are more expected for the style. The flavor is likewise interesting and complex, albeit restrained, with a subtle combination of plums, raisins, brown sugar, and surely plenty of other components that I can't identify individually but muddle together to create the delicate, dry, fruity sweetness that seems to change in small ways with every sip. The specific characteristics within this pleasant jumble of flavors are further concealed by the super-fine carbonation, which gives the beer a texture that is energetic at first, but creamier after a few minutes.
The one big knock I have against this beer is the alcohol presence. For as hyped as this beer is, I found it to be boozier than I was expecting (contrary to what many others have commented). This booziness would be more understandable if the flavors were more potent, but then again it seems that this beer is meant to tantalize the taste buds rather than punish them. I can only imagine that if I had been more patient and given the alcohol heat some more time in the "cellar" to calm, allowing the subtlety of the flavors to truly shine, I would have seen this beer as the world-class stuff it is known to be. As it stands, however, it is still a unique, complex, enjoyable beer that suffers a bit from its potency. 1,669 charactersdevilben02, Jul 08, 2010

Served in one of the nicest beer glasses of the trappist beers, the dark brown beer looks almost like coke. An average amount of head colored light brown sat on top of the beer but dwindled after a few sips. I do not know how long the beer at the cafe has been aged (or if at all). It has a most enjoyable complex taste. Fruity and sweeter initially fading to lightly sweet, deep caramel malt flavor bordering on a malt liquor type taste. Very smooth and finishing with a crispness that leaves the mouth just slightly dry dry. Truly excellent beer. 641 characterszwalk8, Jul 05, 2010

Poured into a generic goblet.
A: Dark brown with reds appearing in the light. Not the darkest quad. Creamy 2-3 finger head, a tan color, but doesn't last very long. Looks great.
S: A mix of fruits, very dark and distinct, but not overpowering. You can certainly smell the caramel.
T: This is where this brew makes its name. It's hard to imagine that it's 10.2% ABV, as unlike Rochefort, there is no alcohol taste at the end. Very smooth with fruity, sweet flavors, shadowed by dark spices and the caramel coming through. Overall, perfect.
M: A very nice feel. Was surprisingly lighter than I expected, though I could have still done with a little more carbonation. Very smooth.
D: Perfectly balanced flavors, perfect taste. A little heavy for top drinkability marks, but it is not a weak point of this beer. 858 characterspauljmccain, Jul 04, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The reason this beer is so highly rated is because it is so very drinkable. On a scale of 1 to 5 this gets a 10 for drinkability.
We tried Westy 12 along with a Westy 8 and a Rochefort 10 so we could have an appropriate comparison. Taste-wise, this is very similar to the Rochefort 10 with the exception that the Westy 12 is less profound, and less "in-your-face". The alcohol is very well hidden. It made the Rochefort 10 seem almost like an extreme beer with too much alcohol presence and too much power on the palate by comparison.
Westvleteren 12 pours a dark, reddish-brown with very little head. The aroma is moderate with a touch of spice. First impression was that there was no defineable characteristic that jumps out at you that explains why this beer is so highly regarded. It is soft and very well-balanced with a creamy, light mouthfeel. As it warms in the glass, the tastes of fig and soy sauce come alive on the tongue. The finish is pleasant and reveals a touch of nutmeg. 
That is the secret to this beer's success. It is moderately flavorful and complex while still being soft and gently balanced.
I agree with other reviewers that the alcohol is well-masked and I think that is the reason why this is the highest rated beer on the site. While I have occasionally struggled to get through a whole bottle of the similarly structured Rochefort 10, the Westvleteren 12 is a kinder, gentler quadrupel that I could see myself drinking all day long. 1,465 charactersPrinceDarren, Jul 02, 2010

Cap dated: 17.11.12
Pours a murky reddish brown with some khaki head that recedes quickly. Complex hues, reminds me of cherry wood.
Nose: Figs and dates, dried oats and old barnboards. Forest floor, dry leaves. I want to say musty, but it's not like mold or attic, it's like an old hay barn. Something right off the bat like fruitcake or preserved citrus.
Palate: Rich and creamy right off the bat. "Rum raisin" per Carl Crafts. Pound cake, tanned leather, figs (both fresh and dried). Complex and tasty. The finish has creeping astringency from the hops. No hop flavor to speak of, but a drying finish. I'm actually kinda parched. Some tin or metallic note way out on the finish.

A- Pours a dark reddish brown color. Red hues show up when held to the light. Two finger light tan that had good retention to it. Left nice streaky lacing as I sipped this one down.
S- Dark fruits dominate the nose but not overtake it. Raisin and figs are the dark fruits. A nice fresh baked bready aroma in the middle of this that kind of threw me off. LIght spicing along with brown sugar in this beer. Overall a good smelling beer not the best I've smelled in the style though. 
T- Dark fruits come up first on the palate. Figs and raisin along with a light cherry note to it. This dies down due to a light spicing in the beer. The middle of this comes through with a interesting bready malt. There is a light sweetness from candi sugar I would say with some yeasty notes in the tail end of the taste. A light but apparent alcohol flavor comes through at the very end washing away all flavor.
M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation was dead on with this beer. Velvety smooth overall. Some light dark fruits with a bready goodness left on the palate. Light alcohol and some sweetness in the aftertaste. The flavors were blended amazing yet each flavor was individual. Clean tasting overall. 
D- This beer is an amazing drinker. Although, I don't see the hype with the all 5's, I do feel the drinkability should be a 5. The alcohol is very well hidden and the beer overall is very smooth. I would recommend this beer to everyone who hasn't tried it. 1,596 charactersalleykatking, Jun 18, 2010

A - A dark reddish-brown, basically a mahogany color with a very nice looking brown head. I always find that impressive in a non-stout.
S - I get a ton of raisins on this, by far the overwhelming scent. After that it's brown sugar, currants, maybe some figs. A little bit of earthy tone in there. This is definitely a dark-fruit smelling beer.
T - Holy raisins Batman! Huge raisin taste and some nice fig compliment. Some other dark fruit comes in, as well as some mild earth tones. Honestly, I get no alcohol on this, very velvety.
M - Velvety, full bodied, great natural carbonation for such a thick brew.
D - Hard to believe it's over 10%, Rochefort has a much stronger alcohol taste. This is quite drinkable and sweet. While it may not be my favorite beer, I can understand why it would be the concensus #1 beer over all. A lot of universal appeal, and the mystique of the Westverleten monks helps I'm sure. However, is it blasphemous to say I like Rochefort 10 better? 1,045 charactersAgentZero, Jun 16, 2010

Best before February 1, 2012 (listed as 01.02.12 on cap).
Poured into a Chimay goblet.
Appearance: Poured out flat: no head, no bubbles, no signs of carbonation. Bummer. I hope it wasn't meant to be like this. Though I was very careful to leave the end contents in the bottle, the body is still loaded with sediment (as was the Westy 8 we had right before this). Gorgeous color: ruby-amber through the center and orange-yellow around the edges. Looks oily when swirled. No lacing.
Smell: Red apple, cinnamon, figs, dark currants, and lemony and berry-like esters. Very balanced and very complex. I also get cherry cola, molasses, and brown sugar. Very nicely done.
Taste: Red apple, cherry lemonade, and molasses upfront; earth and leather in the finish. Caramel also plays a pretty big role in the flavor profile.
Mouthfeel: Flat, syrupy, and full. Finishes dry and earthy. The lack of carbonation really shows through in the mouthfeel.
Drinkability: Tastes and smells nice, but the lack of carbonation ruined it for me. I hope I got a bad bottle. Otherwise, I can't understand how this is ranked so high. 1,228 charactersThreeWiseMen, Jun 15, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Dark chestnut with garnet red hues and an above average sized, creamy, smooth, tight foamy head. Good retention that finally rests into a nice, creamy, smooth layer of lace.
S - Wonderful mix of dark fruit (raisin, date, a bit of cherry, and lots of other dark fruit). Strong amount of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pepper, allspice, coriander, etc.) paired with some warming alcohol. Also a good amount of dark caramel malt.
T - Similar to the nose. Well balanced and complex, and hard to fully describe so I'll just say wow. Strong amount of spice (similar to the nose) along with a touch of warming alcohol that compliments the spice. Dark fruit mixes in well with raisin being the strongest, but others making a showing. Has a good amount of candi sugar, Belgian sweetness along with the dark fruit. Also has a good amount of dark, sweet, caramel, and slightly bready malt. Wonderful mix of sweet, spice, fruit, etc.
M - Medium body with a perfect amount of carbonation. Wasn't quite as thick as I was expecting, but it works well with the taste. Incredibly smooth and creamy.
D - So easy to drink with the smooth and creaminess and the well balanced flavors. Would gladly drink another.
Notes: Best before 24/03/13. Wonderful beer that lived up to the hype for me. Well balanced and complex. Really an enjoyable beer that I would gladly drink again. A touch lighter than what I was expecting, but it worked well. Very tasty beer, with all the hype I can see how it might fall short for a number of people, but all in all I think most people would gladly drink another. 1,584 charactersFreshHawk, Jun 13, 2010

Pours an absolutely gorgeous hazy deep amber with beautiful thick foamy head that lingers... and lingers... and lingers leavinng sticky lacing on whatever bit of glass it comes in contact with. 
It seems to be PERFECTLY carbonated as the head just sticks around throughout the entire session, each time I take a sip the little finger of foam comes right back as bubbles continually flutter up from the bottom of the glass - truly a sight to behold.
Aromas of dark fruit and malt with a flavor that is similar but with MORE of everything. Beautifully balanced - no one flavor taking precedence over another. This is a truly GREAT beer and one that I will drink again ANY chance I get. I could go on... and on... and on... but I've got to get back to drinking this!!!
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! 1,065 charactersthetomG, Jun 12, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This bottle is fairly fresh - many thanks to Brabander for sending these out! Dated drink by 27.10.12, and poured into a Chimay goblet at about 50 degrees. Today we are celebrating the official beginning of summer for my wife, the English teacher and Belgian beer lover.
A - The bottle had some dried sediment near the cap, but the pour remained sediment-free. Slowly decanted, it left a 3 finger head with an off-white color. Tons of lacing. Deep mahogany body. I can't imagine any better here.
S - Divine. Dark fruit dominates - raisin, plum, balanced with a healthy dose of unidentified warm spice aroma.
T&M - Hype aside, this is an amazing beer on all levels. I tried to leave taste at 4.5, but as it warms it gets even better. This beer is warming without being hot, robust while remaining airy, and sweet with a long dry finish. There is a slight tannic note at the end that I could imagine might mellow with time. I wish I had a chance to try this with varying degrees of age.
D - Oh no!!! It is almost gone... This is the worst part by far... So good and so drinkable. I wish these monks were closer. 1,113 charactersdougofthefuture, Jun 11, 2010

A - pours a deep mohagany with a light tan head and some lacing. I would like a little more head on this off of the pour, but its a 2003, so that needs to be taken into consideration
S- Major raisins off from the start and alll the way through. I get some light oaky-vanilla and cherries at the end.
T- raisins again, but not as much a the smell. more vanilla and tobacco at the end. lots going on here and they blend very very well. very, very light alcohol kick at the end, but a pleasant one.
m- smooothh and creamy with perfect carbonation. slightly light on the mouthfeel and a tiny hot at the end, but great overall.
d- i could drink this beer until i was blue in the face. my oh my, this is not my favorite beer ever, but probably the best beer i have ever had. lived up to the hype for sure 931 charactersdrink1121, Jun 10, 2010

A - Deep ruby red, huge foamy off white head. Wonderful retention and lacing all over. Lovely deep ruby in the light. 5.0
S - Lots of biscuit and caramel, hint of raisins. Hint of fig and very light alcohol in the nose. This is pretty damn near perfect. 5.0
T - This is hands down one of the best tasting quadrupels/BSDA's I've ever had. Wonderful balance between the sweetness and the caramel, candi sugar, figs, and biscuity yeast. Lightest bit of bittering in the finish but just enough to complement the flavors. 4.5
M - Excellent, rich and bubbly carbonation. Moderately dry finish but excellent indeed. Effing A man. 5.0
D - Impeccable. Fanf***ingtastic. No alcohol detected in the finish, but a very distant warmth returns. 5.0 877 charactersDmanGTR, Jun 09, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Notes from a tasting in 10/08
Bottle ordered and consumed at In De Vrede, the abbey cafe.
Poured in to a Westvleteren goblet, opaque brown with a frothy tan head that left fine lace on the glass. Lots of dark fruit in the nose, ripe currant, dark cherries, run-soaked raisins...yes, it smells boozy. Some breadiness too.
In the mouth, the first thing you notice is the alcohol. Having this beer fresh, at the source, has its advantages and its drawbacks and the heat of this beer when so young is one of the drawbacks. But once you get past the alcohol up front, there is a wonder of flavors. A rich maltiness, velvety smooth and all the dark fruit comes through. Raisin, currant, plum and dark cherry, underpinned with sweet spice, a breadiness and sweet finish that is promptly made clean by the strong alcohol. A velvety mouthfeel though. It's pretty damn good.
A beer that lives up to the hype. The only drwaback was drinking it so young; I would imagine that having this with 6-18 more months of age on it would make it heavenly. As it is, the heat of the alcohol is the only flaw. 1,090 charactersViveLaChouffe, Jun 07, 2010

4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I got this beer by driving to Sint Sixtusabdij in April 2009; my third trip to the Abbey. Having made the hours long adventure several times from my temporary home in Heidelberg, Germany, Westvleteren beer has a place in my heart like no other. It is only fitting that my first review is it's highly regarded "12." 
From the many times I've drank this lovely brew, I know that this is a beer quite susceptible to a "wow!" reaction, and I usually leave it at that. For this review I will attempt to break it down, although my palate, inexperienced in the art of beer review, may prove inadequate to the task. 
Served in a Westvleteren goblet slightly below room temp.
Appearance: As I crack the bottle it exudes a characteristic mist. In the goblet, the beer is dark brown, although not 100% opaque. It has a luxurious 1 inch head, which settles a bit with some silky lacing, especially along the sipping side of the goblet.
Smell: Sweet, with hints of coffee, nuts and alcohol blended into a coherent whole. My wife detects grapes or apple; a second wiff, I can't pick out grapes but maybe a hint of cloves, similar to that in a spiced cider. Ultimately, smells like it tastes- amazing
Taste: First sip I detect rich coffee and malt overtones with caramel sweetness resolving into a distinct but not unpleasant alcohol aftertaste. It has a completeness/coherence that I find with very few beers and which makes it difficult to pick out individual flavors. Subsequent sips resolve into a sort of candy with an alcoholic bite, and a slight walnut aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel: The head is substantial in the first sip. Once the head dies down, the liquid reveals a pleasant heaviness. Swishing small sips, the liquid resolves itself into a silky luxurious foam. Larger sips retain their silkiness in the liquid.
Drinkability: Great overall. Despite the clear presence of the high (10.2%) ABV, I would feel comfortable (as I have on several occasions) drinking several of these in one sitting, although as it shows its effects promptly it's not always a good idea : ) Low diminishing returns; the last sip is almost as great as the first. 
Overall, with an unrivaled coherence, great mouthfeel, and a taste unlike any other Belgian ales I've tried (and I've tried quite a few) Westvleteren 12 is in a class all its own and is one of my favorite beers. In fact, the 8 may be the only other beer that really comes close. 2,417 charactersmiketizzy28, Jun 01, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from an unlabeled bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. The barkeep retrieved the bottle from a cabinet under the bar in an out-of-the-way establishment in Brussels to which I was directed in my search.
A: Dark chestnut, assuming a ruby hue in the light. The colour lightens considerably as it is drunk. A large, appealing head dissipates rather quickly. Little to no noticeable carbonation. Nice tracing on the top complements a delicate lacing left in the beer's wake.
S: Surprisingly unassuming smell. Definite notes of alcoholic fruits, but faintly. Maybe a touch of malt. Honestly, at this point I began doubting the alleged excellence. However, the smell grew on me over time as I became accustomed to the taste.
T: Indescribable. Any doubts I may have had were washed away in an unexpected blast of ecstasy. This beer is damn tasty and complex as hell. Dark fruits assail you, and sharp spices dance across tongue similar to carbonation. Malt follows in force, but the sweetness isn't overwhelming due to the crazy balancing spiciness. (What is this flavour[s]!? Vaguely reminiscent of hops, but as distinctive as it is elusive.) Aftertaste is dry and ever-so-slightly bitter, again alluding to a hop character buried under the fruity maltiness.
M: Punchy alcoholic sweetness butts heads with the aforementioned spice(s), resulting in an extraordinarily complex, but enjoyable, mouthfeel. Tingly and strong, full-bodied and almost nutty. Perhaps not exceptional in and of itself, but as part of the package...
D: Again, the alcohol content isn't shy about showing itself, and the punchiness is considerable. But still, this beer is utterly fantastic, and one I will return to again and again as long as I have the money and opportunity. Worth the trip to Belgium. 1,780 charactersAgentMunky, May 31, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 511.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip. 16-02-13 printed on the cap. 
(A)- Pours a dark brown; almost a reddish purple color that produced a huge cream colored fluffy yet bubbly head with unbelievable retention; I still have a good layer of foam with the last sip! It left behind all kinds of lacing here and there all the way down.
(S)- Some ripe dark fruits of primarily plum with bits of banana, lemon, clove, and clay. Has a light biscuit-like grain in the background. Rather earthy too with clay mentioned before and dry yeast.
(T)- A rich body of ripe dark fruits, but is mostly overshadowed by a richness of dense wheat/biscuit grain and a lemon/banana/almost roasted sweetness. One of the richer quads I have had.
(M)- A rather fizzy carbonation level that creates a party in the mouth. Has a good balance of rich earth, dark fruits, and biscuit. Rather dry too, but sweet and a little bitter at the same time. An absolute delight that goes down smooth, and actually hides the ABV extremely well.
(D)- I can definitely see how this has received such high reviews, but does it deserve the No.1 spot? I am not sure. What I am sure of though is that this is a perfect example of the style and yet adds another level of richness into the mix. An absolute joy to drink; it only got better and better after each sip. No matter what position this is in, its just plainly one of the finest belgains I have had the pleasure of consuming. 1,437 characterssweemzander, May 31, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 511.2 oz bottle thanks to Erik "hayesez" for this beer in trade.
Waited to set this up in context, the event being my 45th birthday (yesterday), and a "horizontal" tasting including Trappistes Rochefort 10 & St. Bernardus 12. Conducted as a "blind tasting".
Appearance: Dark brown with a rich head about 1/2", poured into a Chimay chalice. Perfect lacing sip after sip throughout drinking the beer. 
Smell: Deep, deep complexity, fragrant, chocolate, malt, dark fruit.
Taste: My God, how deep, rich dark chocolate at the outset, then the dark fruit, some sweetness, then some gentle hop bitterness all working perfectly in concert. Unmatched balance. 
Mouth: Smoothness beyond compare, really better than any other beer I have ever had.
Drinkability: Are you kidding? I could drink this forever.
I was hoping that I would prefer the St. Bernardus or the Rochefort 10; I was hoping this beer was all about the hype. My hopes were dashed, if this beer was as available as the other two mentioned it would still be number one. It deserves its reputation and rating. 1,068 charactersBobZ, May 29, 2010

A: Deep deep ruby red with a small white head that fades to a small lace on the glass. Good.
S: Port wine upfront blended with booze, sweet sugar malt, grape, bananas, raisin, oak. Sheesh perfect blends. Awesome!
T: A little boozy blended with tons of grape port. Hints of raisin and dark fruit. Taste not as extensive as expected. Good.
M: Leaves a nice stickiness that is not overpoweing. Perfect blend of carbonation. Awesome.
D: Goes down good. Once you get past the winey booze, it goes down very easy. Good.
All in all, this one was definitely not as good as expected. Very good, but not amazing. I'd say top 10 for me, but not #1. You definitely gotta try this one at least once if you're beer geek! 813 characterssteve8robin, May 29, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I am extremely excited to finally get an opportunity to try this beer after hearing so much about it. Pours a beautiful dark brown color, with a nice, fairly quickly dissipating beige-colored head. Aromas of candied fruits, dark brown sugar, caramel, Belgian yeast and sherry. Flavors of freshly baked brown bread, stewed plums, toffee and port wine. An exceptionally complex beer, and one that definitely lives up to its reputation. Is it the best beer in the world? No, but it's certainly in the conversation. 511 charactersemmasdad, May 28, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Before i go ahead and write a few words about the my new favorite beer i have to say that i would not give a beer that wasnt perfect a perfect score. I had this beer in a vertical tasting with saint bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10. westy easily stands out as the best among these two.
The beer has a deep amber brown color with a beautiful rocky head. Seriously this is the best looking head i have ever seen!
Surprisingly it smells just like a Pilsner, very different from the other two beers in the tasting. Not overly sweet, not overly fruity, just a little plum like. very balanced.
Taste is so good that i cant even believe it. I cant really find the words to describe it. It clearly stands out among its peers as the best. Very, very balanced with a hint of plums and raisins, i tiny bit of bitterness. I am stuck wanting to keep drinking but also wanting to slow down to savor the beer. UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING
Full mouthfeel. Very rich but not too rich. Fills the entire mouth with westvleteren goodness. pretty carbonated.
Outstandingly drinkable for a 10.2%er. I could drink it all day and all night and never tire. I might get very drunk, but i would never ever get tired of this master piece of a brew. 1,214 charactersAlexTheAleMan, May 26, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Here it is - beer of beers. I raised my tulip to billab914 before enjoying this one. I have to preface this review with a promise that in 2 years, I've only ever given one other perfect rating. I can't say I can think of anything to possibly improve this one, either. A beer that not only lived up to, but exceeded expectations. 
There's possibly no prettier beer out there. I mean, perfection in appearance in a glass. Ruby-tinged chestnut brown, with only the slightest clarity that reveals light bubbles running throughout. An exceptionally well-retained 1 1/2-finger off-white, soft, foamy head lies atop the beer, and it leaves behind glass-swathing rings of soft, fluffy lace. 
As with the 8, this beer smells nearly too good to drink. Impeccably delicious nose full of candi sugar, figs, spices, perfumey florals, toasted grains, sticky raisins and brandy. It smells like I'm about to drink some fine spirit that's been aging in someone's cellar for decades, and then I realize it's something much better - beer:)
This beer is so delicious that I have to force myself to drink more slowly. Malts are toasted and sweetly caramelly, the combination yielding a nice, robust and buttery toffee flavor. Sweet and sticky fruitiness of figs, raisins and prunes, along with the sugar give a honey-like sweetness that reminds me a little of meads and glaze the palate to prolong the enjoyment. The alcohol peeks out a little from the aftertaste, and it has an overall pleasant warming effect. This beer continues to open up as it warms, and the flavors grow deeper and fuller. Feel is gently carbonated, creating an effervescence that balances the fullness of the flavors and the body with a lightness on the tongue. 
Drinkability isn't even worth discussing. I could drink this beer every day and never tire of it. While high in the ABV department, you'd never know by the taste. 1,882 characterskels, May 25, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is third time that I have had a Westy 12 and finally decided to review it. 
Pulled one of the older vintages I have with best by date of March 2010 on the label. Although I have had this three times, I stil get a very special feeling when opening one.
Very interesting to read the reviews about the appearance of this beer. For the one I poured Sat night, it poured a chestnut brown with very little head being generated. These have been stored with great care; the other ones that I have sampled of fresher vintage produced a much greater head and lacing than this 3 year old sample.
S & T - What else can you add that has not already been said. I stil think this has a magnificent flavor profile. The three years have mellowed it some and made it a bit sweeter than I remember fresher vintages. Figs, prune, raison, and a delightfully sugary candy taste are all present. Truly an epic experience for your taste buds.
M - Maybe not as creamy as I remember the fresher versions. A little thinner than I remember but still delightful.
D - Here is where I think the 3 years has done well. No hints of booziness at all. Smooth as silk. Wonderul.
Stil a masterpiece. I have about 6 bottles of the gold still remaining. Another one won't come out until X-mas eve but I am looking forward to a couple of blondes (who isn't) this summer. 1,341 charactersBeerisheaven, May 24, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Inspired by the reviews on this and other sites, I rode all the way down to the abbey's meeting center "In de Vrede" to taste this famous beer and see if it would beat my fave sofar, the Rochefort 10, closely followed by the St Bernardus Abt (12).
First impression, what a beautiful deep red (when looking through it towards the sun) and dark brown, with an awesome white, firm and steady, foam; unlike many other quads whose foam turn cream or beige colored). A=5.
The scent was a delight, no overpowering alcohol hue, but a tapestry of sweets and something undefinable spicy, made my mouth water and urged me to bite into the foam. S=5.
The taste, how can I describe the taste. a myriad of different sensations, with every sip becoming more and more magical and define. This brew did not just surpass the "Roche 10" it humiliated, no... obliterated it. The brew slowly getting a little warmer in the late aft sun changed flavor patterns with the temp, but all so intricate, so seductive to the taste buds, I almost decided to knock on the abbeys front portal and join the order ;-) T=5 (but should be a 10)
A full frothy and beautiful white foam, a light sparkle, not to strong carbonated, yet just right on the money, love making to the tongue, another 5: M=5
And lastly the drinkability: the Westvleteren 12 tries to make you belief its way lighter a brew then it is, everything on it is perfect, scent, looks, above all the amazing taste completes itself with a wonderful and (hangover free) buzz, that will hit you while you still think you could drink 5 bottles more before noticing anything. D=5
This is indeed the best beer I ever had, and I had many, Quads, triples, doubles, stouts, ales, lambics, witbiers gotta go now hit the phone see if I can order a crate of Westys... 1,790 charactersMortNoire, May 24, 2010

What should I say ? That this one pours a beautiful, dark ivory colour with a beautiful and puffy tan coloured head ? Or should it needs to be described as a beer with unmatched complexity in taste ? Should I use adjectives like dark fruits, cherries and figs for the taste or maybe that the Westvleteren 12 is truly the nectar of the gods and goes down like honey ? I think I will leave it here, there are enough reviews on BA to give you an idea of how great the beer is, but it really needs to be had to do justice to its persona. It is incredible and desrves the reverence.
The monks don't think about us while making the beer, nor do we think about them while having it, but we miss them when we think about the Westvleteren. Worth the trouble and hype. Worth review No 100. 875 charactersBeerSingh, May 23, 2010

Pours a deep amber brown with a generous caramel colored head. Has an aroma of dark fruit, caramel and malts. Some breadiness. The taste was worth the wait. This beer is not overrated. Sweet up front, then dark fruit taste. Chocolate notes show up. The carbonation hits at the perfect spot. Nice dry clean bitter finish with a subtle tart aftertaste. 417 characterschalsk, May 23, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance - Everything I could hope for. Big head, great color. The mystery bottle and identifying cap add to the alure.
Smell - Figgy, fresh, a bit boozy.
Taste - Indescribable. Delicious.
Mouthfeel - Very carbonated, smooth, as good as anything I've had, though I don't typically discriminate by mouthfeel unless a beer is flat or thin.
Drinkability - I could drink two of these with no issue. After that, the booze would be too much. But I'm sleeping by then anyway.
This beer was absolutely incredible. I've been drinking St. Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10 to prepare myself to try it. Then this puppy blew them out of the water. Unbelievable, the difference. More fruity taste, and a delicious warmth. Not as boozy as other quads I tried, and I can easily say if this ever comes across my path again, I won't be trading it away. 834 charactersJNewbs, May 21, 2010

Poured with near zero head or apparent carbonation. Murky, apple-cider color, looks like its going to have a little thickness to it. Smells sweet and deeply fruity, expectations of raisins.
Taste followed the smell, got plenty of raisiny fruit and a yeasty sweetness. Definitely no misgivings about it being a belgian quad. The combination of creamy, cask-like texture and the powerful sweetness is not my preference but I'm enjoying this beer. Belgians are not my favorite beers, this was my 4th quad (seems appropriate) and I found this to be the most interesting one I've had. Also less drinkable than others due to the sweetness and thickness. 831 charactersliquidcraft, May 20, 2010

Upon opening we have a light gusher.
Pours dark ivory with slight head that does not stick around beyond a slight skimming.
Nose is light. Phenols are detected along with classic Belgian Trappist yeast. Not much hop scent.
Taste.. is good. Its definitely a high quality brew. Its got some similarities to the Westvleteren 8 but I think it has less flavor. Its got dark fruits but they are not as evident. Raisins, plum, cola... I get just a hint of alcohol. Pretty smooth mouth feel. 
Overall its good but definitely not as good as the 8. Being as how I lucked upon this and might never get another, I think the St Bernardus Abt 12 will do just fine as its equal. 690 characterselvisnj, May 19, 2010
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A huge thanks to Brad for sharing several of these with me over the last few years.
Westvleteren 12 pours a somewhat thin looking brown hue with a nice sized head and decent lacing. Ooo...there's some abbey floaties in my glass...straight from God. Amen. Sweet malt with raisins, figs, and seductive Belgian yeast fill the senses throughout the smell and taste. What deliciousness! The beer is a bit thin in the feel, but on a positive note, this makes it silky smooth and easy to drink. The aftertaste is great and lingers for a considerable time between sips. This is remarkable beer.
Edit: July 21, 2012
Split a 2005 vintage with Brad. Rain water, earth, malt, yeast. Sublime. Hard to find any fault with this. 716 charactersHuhzubendah, May 18, 2010

Been waiting around for the right time to try it but yesterday was finally time. Shared the 33 cl bottle three ways. Just a big enough pour for each of us to get a good feel for the beer. From notes. 
Pours a muddy dark brown, no head at all. Barely looks carbonated. Smell is dominated by juicy ripe dark fruits. Also there is some spice, brown sugar and subtle yeastiness. Taste is very port like, definitely a dessert beer. And I don't mean it is a beer to be paired with dessert but rather is a dessert in and of itself. More unctuous sweet juicy ripe dark fruits, apple cider, candied sugar, a spice that is somewhere between cinnamon and nutmeg, and a subtle yeastiness. Surprisingly clean taste, much less funky than I would have expected. Very little aftertaste, each sips leaves a sweet warming sensation. It is thick and mouthcoating with very little carbonation that borders on being cask-like. Drinkability is difficult to judge with such a small pour, but I think the sweetness would get to me pretty quickly. I'm not sure if I would want to do an entire bottle. That's ok though, beers like this are way more fun to drink when shared anyways. 
Best beer ever? What does that even mean...? Anyways it certainly was great, and definitely one of the best Belgian beers I have had yet. 1,375 charactersShumista, May 18, 2010

Private tasting with Shango42 and Phidelt
Real big thanks to Shango42 for sharing this 2010 vintage!!!!
A - A finger of foam, mixture of browns and yellow's, a bit cloudy with a finger of foam and a good lacing ring
S - Caramel, malts, brown sugar maybe some vanilla plus a wine smell that reminded me of grapes. Lighter hop aroma but nothing to strong
T - Sweet caramel taste at first but then moved in the brown sugar vanilla flavor. I picked up some grape taste, not sweet for grapes but a wine sour taste but the blend of everything is close to perfection
M/D - Medium bodied brew, so ever so smooth. A brew that lived up to its name for sure a must try for anyone who can get their hands on one. I hope to have a chance to have another someday but if not I am for sure glad at least one!!!! 884 charactersFreshmanPour77, May 13, 2010

Poured deep red with thick white head, great lace and retention, something very appealing about it. Smell was intense, sweet cherries, raisins, caramel and malt, alcohol in the nose too. Taste was equally intense, incredibly smooth and complex, sweet and bitter fruit and bready malt followed by spice and alcohol warming, yeasty with some more spice and alcohol bite in the finish.

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was recently on holiday in Belgium when I had occasion to stop by Cambrinus in Bruges where I was fortunate to order the last bottle of Westvleteren 12 in the bar. It was such a momentous event to me that I decided to journal the experience of drinking this beer in a style similar to a "play-by-play" analysis, only it is "sip-by-sip" in this particular instance. This is what I recorded:
After the first sip, the only question I have is "Who are you in this terrible form?" 
Second sip - It was an explosion of grapes. All I could say was "Oh my god."
Third sip - In which I sniffed at the glass so hard that a portion of the beer made it into my left nostril. It is hard to say the taste seeing that it is mixed with day-old snot.
Fourth sip - This was Bacchus giving birth in my mouth. And, I was just informed that this is the last 12 in the bar, which means it is the god's only child.
Fifth sip - It must be wine. (and here I drew a picture of the beer)
Sixth sip - Left me destitute. I thought, "Yes, I can survive this." But then I held it in my mouth longer and longer until I held the precious nectar so long that I thought my tongue would disintegrate and my mouth would invert from concave to convex. It blew my synapses. Somewhere, a vineyard blossomed. And that place was inside my face.
Seventh sip - Unbelievable!!!! Unbelievable!!!
About an hour into the experience, I am approaching the end of the beer. At that point, I have only this to say:
I cannot even begin to describe the end of the Westvleteren. It sits there...waiting.... 1,562 characterssuperwombatgodde, May 07, 2010

4.32/5  rDev -6.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured up considerably lighter in colour than I was expecting; medium brown body with virtually no head.
Smell was mild spice, and funnily enough, a honey aroma, as well. In fact, this bottle was shared between myself and two others and we all agreed this was almost remniscent of a spiced mead as far as smell goes.
Taste was pleasantly malty with quite a bit of dark fruit nuances.
Drinkability was absolutely fantastic with masterfully concealed alcohol. This drank no where close to 10,2%.
Mouthfeel was very silky and not as heavy as I had prepared myself for. Very easy to drink and smooth in the mouth.
Without a doubt, a very skillfully crafted beer and completely different from what I was expecting. 709 charactersSilentSabre, May 03, 2010

A: Dark brown body with creamy and solid head.
S: Aromatic smell of dark fruits and sweet sugar, very soft and pleasant. I was stuck at smelling it for pleasure during few seconds, I could just smell it all till there is nothing left. Very sublime and complex.
T: Dark fruits, prunes, caramel with added awesomeness. First time I can rate the taste as exceptional.
M: I think the mouth feel is the best aspect of this beer. You feel like you're in heaven and drinking a cloud. The softness and pleasant after-taste last several minutes.
D: I was very afraid that this beer will be overrated and nothing exceptional, but I was wrong. I must agree it is really exceptional. The high price and unavailability makes me kind of sad but makes me also think about becoming a monk myself, on the other hand :) 923 charactersmmahut, May 02, 2010

A: Dark ruby hue. Some sediment floating around.

T: On initial taste, its a rush of flavors with champangne like carbonation activity taking place. Maltiness and yeast are present. Nut and caramel. By taste 6, the carbonation lays back, and those nutty tastes come out. Alcohol is well hidden, though I do feel internal warmness.
Great overall. Happy I tried it. I would love to have it again. I think I expected to be blown away, yet I cant think of a beer that I have had.

4.45/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is my 10th review, so I thought I'd break out one of the big boys...
It pours a deep chestnut color with a slight burnt-sienna tint. Quite opaque but with visible yeast. At first, there was about a 1/2 finger of milky, yeasty head with large bubbles, but it died down quickly. As I drank, there was a consistent, soft lacing on the sides of the glass and bubbles around the rim.
My boyfriend broke out his Westy 12 at the same time, and for some reason his smelled totally different. Mine had a little bit of barnyardy funk that was not present in his, which was also a little less boozey smelling than mine. Overall, mine had a stronger nose, especially as it opened with noticeable floral and caramel aromas.
The taste is sweet, buttery and nutty, with a hoppy after-taste. Yeast and a slight booziness fade a bit as it opens up. My boyfriend's bottle was floral tasting and almost a bit soapy.
Mouthfeel was surprisingly thin for a 10.2%, but I enjoyed the light carbonation.
Drinkability was excellent, as it left me feeling remarkably refreshed.
Needless to say, being the #1 rated beer on BA, I had extremely high hopes for this one. It didn't necessarily disappoint, but was perhaps less stellar than I expected, especially after having tried 8 a few months ago, which I found to have an unbelievable crisp, butteriness to both the taste and mouthfeel. 1,370 charactersBeckyFreesTibet, Apr 22, 2010

What can I say that hasn't already said about this amazing brew. So complex. I couldn't even begin to describe the aromas and flavors. I looked here on BA for inspiration and came across the review by Feloniousmonk:
"...requires a new vocabulary!...serious contemplation is required, for I am seriously, honestly, taken aback by the force of, not only the alcoholic content, but the strong, full, bewitching flavor of this incredible ale! It staggers the senses! Honestly, I reel from it's effects and must wait until my consciousness can comprehend what is going on...many layers, many flavors, many ways that this incredible concoction can impact upon the senses."
Monk's description is everything I wanted to say, but couldn't put into words.

I prepped myself for this and had time to myself, at home, chilling by my open window as the spring breeze blew by. I took my bottle and opened it up gently. As I Gently poured out this brew, I noticed the gracefulness of its body as it filled my glass. Golden color with a hint of reddish rust color. As I finished pouring it in, I also see that the head is little but awake. So, at this point, I usually let it get 10 minutes of warming up at room temp, but i cheated and took a drink right away! How refreshing can a beer get, you ask? Lets just say that i could drink this year round..everyday!! The aroma was mild but every sense of flowery, parfume and almost like a cologne of a sense. Taste of the hops and the yeast are well balanced. Clean and smooth to the palate. It could be drank day in and say out because of the balance. nothing is dominant here.. just great craftsmanship. 936 charactersjojomdma, Apr 20, 2010

A: A thick 2" of head forms from a gentle pour into my Hop Monk snifter. It slowly diminished and melds with the copper mahagony beer below which is a lighter golden at the edges.
S: Initially there's a bit of delicious yeasty funkiness and as it warms, a much stronger Belgian yeast aroma dominates. A rich, concentrated banana bread, soaked in rum with some dark cherries in the background.
T: The taste unfortunately doesn't follow the smell as closely as hoped, and a more medicinal alcohol laden flavor is present with a slight bitter aftertaste. Fairly smooth overall and as it warms is pretty dry and crisp. The Belgian yeast breadiness is in the background but is overpowered by the medicinal flavors unfortunately.
M: Very good carbonation - gives the beer levity. Medium to thick viscosity which is perfect for the style. 
O: For the highest rated beer on BA, I was very disappointed. It is a good quad but when I can go to the corner-store and buy a Rochefort 10 or a St. Bernardus Abt 12 (both of which I think are better than this) for much, much cheaper, it makes this obsolete. Very glad to have tried this, but this is a 'one and done' given the logistics of obtaining more. 1,259 charactersJoeySchlitz, Apr 20, 2010

T: Beautiful. Just a hint of dark berries up front, then that fades into a lovely syrup flavor and a malty kick with just a hint of roasty-ness. Big fruit and yeast come all the way through. There is a little bitter twinge right in the finish. The alcohol is very well hidden.

Review #500
After a few years of cellaring this holy grail of the beer world, I finally decided to pop the cap for this landmark review.
The beer poured a cloudy, deep chestnut brown with a creamy, light tan, one-finger head that quickly dissipated to a thick, lasting mass of bubbly froth. Tiny streaks of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was somewhat restrained initially, yet pleasant. Sweet and plummy. Caramel malts were noticeable. Spicy and just a smidge boozy. As the beer warmed, the unique, floral, fruity boquet that is a signature of Westvleteren beers came alive.
The taste was semi-sweet and quite nutty. Fruity Belgian yeast notes came through up front. Raisins, plums and figs were noticeable. Caramelized candi sugar notes appeared as well. A slightly sour flavor was also detectible. The finish was pithy, dry, slightly bitter and a touch woody. It was also fairly hoppy for the style. Overall, the beer was very well balanced but it was not nearly as flavorful as I anticipated.
The mouthfeel was perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this beer. It was quite thin for the style with an extremely fine and mild carbonation. The liquid almost seemed flat.
Drinkability was quite impressive however. The flavor profile was rather well integrated and the 10.2% ABV was remarkably well masked. It drank like something half its strength.
I loved Westvleteren 8 but I was unimpressed with the 12. This beer had no real qualities that distinguished it from its counterparts. In fact, many of its characteristics seemed rather ordinary. I definitely planning on sampling another bottle in the near future to see if my opinion should change. 1,776 charactersDamian, Apr 13, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thank you so much to BA-er Brabander for sending me two bottles of this heavenly liquid. Westy 12 has been a "holy grail" beer for me since first getting into Belgian brews (as I'm sure it is for many), so this was quite the treat. 
A - Pours a nearly opaque, dark brown, while what little light gets through shows some burgundy hints. A creamy, off-white head topped the pour, settling into a thick, sticky lace. Not necessarily outstanding, but spot-on for the style.
S - Oh wow! The scent of candied, fruits dominates (dark chocolate covered cherries maybe?), followed by a nearly Port, or even Sherry-like presence from the alcohol. The nose is wonderful, and very dessert-like.
T - Nearly right there with the smell, the first taste is of cherries and raisins mixed with a helping of caramelized brown sugar. The alcohol is almost undetectable, although there are some similarities to a sweeter brandy. The slightly "funky" Belgian yeast imparts an immediately identifying flavor, assuring that you'd never mistake the beer's origin. The dominating sweetness is balanced out by a somewhat drying finish.
M - A bit thinner than expected, and even slightly more carbonated, the mouthfeel is, well, different. It's "tingly" on the tongue (for lack of a better description), but still, somehow, very creamy. 
D - For the ABV, this is definitely one dangerously drinkable beer - only offset by the difficulty of procuring a bottle by most would-be drinkers. If I could head to my local beer store and buy a bottle whenever I wanted, I could easily open bottle number two right now. 
Taken on its own, or consumed as a dessert, this is simply heavenly. I can certainly taste the similarities to other, more easily obtainable beers of the style, but Westvleteren 12 somehow stands apart. Whether it's because it's truly that outstanding, or because the hype machine has a grip on my soul remains to be seen. Regardless, this is definitely a beer everyone should try. 1,970 characterseternaljester81, Apr 10, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5First off, thanks to Thijs for hooking me up with this beer. Also, this is my first review on BA. Date on cap is 7.10.12.
Opened on Easter Sunday and poured into my Chimay goblet. Pours a murky brown with a thin white head. Smell is not overpowering but is pleasant. Taste is great, slightly sweet with a hint of raisins. It's strong, but easy to drink.
While not my favorite style of beer, it's easy to see why it is on top of the Best of BA. It's a very enjoyable beer and one that certainly lives up to its reputation. I was not disappointed at all by this beer and will drink it again some day. 600 charactersericwo, Apr 05, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A big thanks to Brabander for generously helping get this great beer into my hands. I split a single bottle of this quad with my wife. We poured it into two .2L Rastal tulip glasses. This bottle had 27.08.12 marked on cap.
A: Deep brown with red or amber undertones. Very dense dark walnut color. Nice carbonation, appears light with tiny bubbles that dissipate quickly and and reform with the slightest bit of agitation.
S: Smells wonderful. I spent the a few moments trying to taste the beer through my nose. A slight smell of alcohol is apparent along with caramels and yeast. Candied sweetness drifts over the dark malty base.
T: This brew is so well balanced. We were surprised it wasn't as sweet as our noses had led us to expect. Alcoholic presence subsides into a balanced bitter hop finish. We tasted it chilled, and then let rest and warm for additional condition sampling. Very smooth for a quad. We found the flavors subtle but not lacking.
M: We scored the mouthfeel the lowest. We found the beer was heavily carbonated. After allowing the beer to sit for a few minutes to de-gas, the mouthfeel was more to our liking. Carbonation aside, the mouthfeel was crisp, clean and creamy. 
D: The drinkability is great. Having never tried this brew before, I was expecting a big, sweet mess. I was so wrong. This beer is smooth, crisp and delicious. It just makes me wish I could enjoy it more often. 1,410 charactersgratefulstu, Apr 05, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well I've had this a few times now, and it's about time I review it. This bottle was a 2005 (Date stamped 10.02.10 on the cap) received by none other than Brad! He's the man!!! My buddy Jeff was stopping by to drop off an empty growler he borrowed and some other brews, and I just happened to be picking up a couple boxes from the mailroom at the same time.... so we decided to crack a 2005 westy 12 at 2pm on a Thursday afternoon. Why the fuck not? 
Poured deep dark brown sugar color with some lighter burnt orange hue at the edge. Impressive appearance in my cantillon stemware. Tiny bubbles compose an impressive beige head that lasts almost too long... permitting me from taking my initial sip. 
Well this was right out of the box into my glass, mailroom temperature... both Jeff and I noted a distinct apple cider aroma... it was uncanny. Really just dark, unfiltered, unpasteurized, spiced apple cider. Along for the ride, some pumpernickel bread, caramelized brown sugar, barely a hint of oxidation, but it is very well integrated. Raisins, pears and some brandy. One of the things that is so impressive about this beer, is that it's 10.2%... it's not 'light' tasting, but still just feels so pleasant on the palate. It's not as 'dark' as previous times that I have had it (or as I remember)... a little less of a dark fruit presence than some other bottles I have been a part of. Low-medium but well-executed carbonation perfectly accentuates the delicate and more subtle flavors of this beer. It's just a masterfully concocted beverage and one that I hope to be able to enjoy for years to come. This review is for the 2005 bottle, but numerically reflects what this beer is fresh, and what it can be with a little time on it. 1,737 charactersIneedabeerhere, Apr 04, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So I stop over my friend Joe's apartment one Thursday afternoon for a quick visit. I was in the area and had to pick up/drop off some things. The timing was good, because he had to pick up some boxes from the mail room.
The box is opened, and there are a ton of goodies. One of them is a 5 year old bottle of Westvleteren 12. 
Are we really about to crack a Westy 12 out of the blue on a Thursday afternoon?
Before there is any time to discuss it, the "mail room temp" bottle is poured into our glasses. My glass is a stemmed tulip, and is a little wide to hold any head for a 5 year old beer. Joe's glass is a stemmed Cantillon flute, and the beer looks much better there. It's got a solid, yellowish brown head and a murky, dark brown head.
We immediately agreed that this beer smelled a lot like apple cider. I was thinking apple fritters when I smelled the cap, but there is definitley some apple in the nose. It reminds me of a holiday scented candle...apple spice. There is a small amount of oxidation and alcohol in the nose, but not much. Other aromas include malty nuttiness, some dark fruits, and figs.
The taste is complex yet smoothly integrated. Yummy is a good word. It's got a good brown sugar and apple dessert flavor to it. Brown sugar sweetness adds to the dessert characters, and there is also some fruity, fig like flavors. Overall, it reminded me of what a big Belgian brown ale would taste like. I have a feeling that this beer is in a strange spot age wise. I'm guessing it was better fresh, but would go through another transformation with more time and get better in the future.
The mouthfeel is the most impressive part of this beer. It's smooth and rich yet surprisingly light on the palate. The carbonation is a little lower than I'm used to, but is still adequate. The drinkability also shocked me. Compared to others in the style, there is no comparison. Other Quads are slow sippers and hard to finish, but this one begged me to drink more than half a bottle. I don't think I've had a beer this big and flavor that was so easy drinking. 2,073 charactersjeffthecheff, Apr 03, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 508, this was poured at the end of a long tasting, but damn did it stand out.
Poured into glasses, three-ways. Beautiful appearance, nice head retention.
The nose was amazing, very complex of dried and tropical fruits, caramel, sweet Belgium yeasts. I smelled the glass for about 10 minutes without even taking a sip.
Taste was transferred from the nose. Smooth, delight, and complexity danced on my tongue. Truly the best beer in the world hands down. Mouth feel was perfect, I was in heaven.
I wish I had several cases of this, I swear it would turn peoples notion about beer. Truly exceptional, to be brewed only by the divine. I can't wait to open up the other bottles further down the road. 694 charactersDajtai007, Mar 31, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5HUGE thanks to Brabander for his generosity!!! Saved my first review just for this one.
Appearance: Dark, reddish brown body (mahogany perhaps). Nice, thick tan/off-white head, just under two fingers. Disappeared rather fast but left fair amount of lacing.
Smell: Sweetness upon first whiff followed by a good amount of dark fruit (plum, fig, perhaps grape). A touch of alcohol shows up late with a tinge of yeast throughout.
Taste: A ton going on here. The sweetness was prevalent to me (Belgian Candi sugar and maybe a bit of brown sugar). But it was countered nicely by a peppery spiciness. The dark fruits jump in (a little cherry lends itself to the mix) and the yeast makes a subtle appearance. The warming presence of the 10.2% is only there as a reminder but not overpowering at all.
Mouthfeel: Very full-bodied without being heavy at all. There's a creamy smoothness here that is very unique and welcomed. Carbonation is there but very light. A slight dryness shows up at the finish. 
Drinkability: Easily is the best Quad I've ever had. I could have easily had more than one of these. Unfortunately I only have one bottle left and I'm going to save that for a spell. If it was more readily available, I would drink this every day. As far as I'm concerned, it lives up to the hype. It is "World Class" as stated on it's page. And I cannot say that I would argue against billing it "Best Beer in the World". 1,420 charactersrandomdanger, Mar 31, 2010

4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Pours a deep brownish amber with a off white head. Not that this factors into the score, but it might be the best looking bottle I've ever seen. Simple and understated, comprised of thick brown glass without a label, its simplicity helps accentuate a stately elegance. Very befitting for the holy grail of beers. 
S - Smells absolutely beautiful. Sweet notes of fruits such as raisins, figs, apples, and berries.
T - Wow extremely complex. So much going on here and oh so tasty. Very sweet with a mixture of fruity flavors, particularly apples and figs. Almost wine like. I can barely even taste the alcohol, I can't believe this is 10%. Finishes dry, no cloying at all. 
M - Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect. So smooth and creamy.
D - This is the most sessionable high alcohol beer I've ever had. The legendary Westy 12 absolutely lived up to the hype. Such a special beer, truly a work of art. I could drink this every day. 932 charactersBostonBrewins, Mar 27, 2010
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The review comprises notes from separate tastings of two different vintages. Scores are for vintage 2008.
Vintage '08: 
The review is based on notes taken in fall/winter 2009.
Yellow capped ascetic bottle with best before date 03.12.2011. Considering that Westveleteren 12 beers are bottled 3 years prior to expiration date the beer is vintage 2008. The pour into St. Bernardus goblet gives muddy rusty - mahogany brown nectar with light tan bubbly head fading into an island of agglomerated bubbles. Aromas of sour cherries, berries, figs & raisins, touch of cocoa, breeze of red wine. The flavor profile is nutty-cocoaish with over-ripened figs, rummy with sweet malt base balanced by mild hoppy bitterness prolonged into lingering subtle bitter aftertaste. Silky smooth and creamy with alcohol unbelievably well hidden the roughly one year old beer is fruitier, with more expressed vinousness and less hoppy character than fresh one. 4 5 5 5 5 = 4.8
Vintage '89
I was told the bottle is '89 vintage therefore 21 yrs old although this cannot be verified as Westvleteren bottles didn't always have BBE date on their crowns. However, the 11% ABV imprinted on the cap indicates this was a pre-1999 bottling. Between 1999 and 2002 the alcohol content of Westvleteren 12 has been gradually reduced from 11% to the current level of 10,2%. Diminishing of ABV was necessary to facilitate the brewing process as high levels of alcohol are more likely to kill the yeast. To the beer.
Into Westvleteren chalice. Clear coppery-mahogany brown body lacking any head apart from short lived bubbly island floating on the surface. In over two decades of aging the beer has undergone a complete transformation from quad to fortified wine or even liqueur: at this stage is highly viscous, alcoholic, sweet and abounds in fruity esters.
Palpable aromas of strongly fortified, port-like wine, intense sugary sweetness, plums, dried fruits represented by prunes, sour cherries , figs and rum soaked raisins. Clear presence of alcohol which is well incorporated into the whole. Each aroma listed reincarnates itself in the flavor department that perfectly matches the nose.The mouthfeel of warming and liqueurish brew is syrupy but not in a sickly manner, with zero carbonation. I'm pouring the beer carefully to keep the black slush at the bottom. Even so the last pour is hazy due to the raised yeasty sediment which adds some spiciness and in contrary with beliefs does not ruin the beer. Fully mature Westvleteren 12 is great, although does not have much in common with what I see as a beer. 2.5 5 5 5 5 = 4.5 2,594 characterscrnipeter, Mar 24, 2010

Mouthful- Very smooth!! not much carbonation

4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5What a great week. First PTY now Westy 12 and in the end NO comparison really.Thankyou to the seller in which I can't say.
The best by date of 1/12/12. Poured a muddy water looking color into my chalice. Probably the best heading I have ever seen almost overflowing the rim of my glass probably two inches thick.Off White heading which was so fizzy and thick mellowed out to a very nice covering and lace around the glass until the bitter end.
Smell is mainly deep candy sugared covered malts with some hints of licorice and very sweet Belgian yeasts. Subtle aromas of darker fruits raisin's,plum,and some figs.
Taste just explodes on the palate an out and out assault. Spicey and peppery yet a very fruity punch. Then a heavy bubbly action fills the tastebuds and settles into a warming alcohol taste that warms the back of the throat and the belly. Numbs the teeth and finishes with a malty kick. 
Mouth is medium to full bodied. Every little sip I take just fills the entire mouth with insane bubbling action. A slight lingering of malts and some very nice yeasty aftertones.
I don't really need to say much more. This stuff is amazing. Worth every dime. I think anyone who enjoys beer should give this a try at least once as it is a little pricey but damn it is well worth it. 1,285 charactersTheFightfan1, Mar 21, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This was truly a special treat and long awaited. I'm glad I got a few, so I can cellar a couple :)
Bottled on Christmas day, 2008!
A: Pours a nice mahogany color with a finger of creamy off-white head. Moderate lacing and decent head retention. 
S: I was a little worried initially because I didn't smell too much. However, once this brew warms up a bit the nose really opens up. Lots of dark fruit predominates the nose: dark cherry, fig, plum, and raisin. Some molasses, caramel, brown sugar, and even chocolate as it gets warmer too. Somehow it manages to be very complex, but pleasantly subtle at the same time. 
T: Whoa, was not ready for this - so many layers of flavor. Each sip starts as one thing and then finishes as something completely different. Dark, dried fruits up front (figs, dates, raisins, etc). This leads to hints of coffee and chocolate towards the end. Caramel malt and molasses are very apparent throughout. Power of the alcohol is also detectable. 
M: A creamy full body with a good amount of alcohol warming. 
D: Amazingly complex - I could slowly sip and enjoy this forever. After a year the alcohol seems to be in perfect balance with everything else. I'm interested to see how this ages, but I also wonder what this tastes like fresh. 
Best quad I've ever had? Yes, I would definitely say so. I've never tasted anything so complex. Best beer in the world? That's a bit more debatable, but it very well could be. 1,448 charactersMrDanno96, Mar 18, 2010

The appereance is basically par for the course for Quads. Dark ruby color, slightly cloudy, some yeast sediment. The aroma is amazing! Dried fruits and brown sugar dominate. Some alcohol, definitely complex. The taste is truly exceptional. Complex and sweet. Slight alcohol warmth. Very smooth. Demerara sugar, prunes, figs, alcohol, dark belgian candy sugar. Whoa! This is the pinnacle. A truly special treat. Amazing drinkability for the style and ABV. The best Trappist beer I've ever had. 
Worth the trouble to obtain, better than the hype. Best Quad ever? Yes. Best beer ever? I'd have a hard time arguing with you. 686 charactersBrew33, Mar 11, 2010

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Brabander for this. I decided to have this at midnight on my birthday. Poured from the bottle into a Chimay goblet.
Appearance: Pours a dark brown with a half inch of foam that maintains during the entire drink with some nice lacing.
Smell: Sugar cane, candied fruits, burnt banana, belgian yeast, hints of caramel and malt towards the end. Possibly the most complex and best smelling beers I've ever smelled.
Taste: Wow. Candied fruits, burnt banana and clove, bready malt, slight brown sugar, and a very nice yeast character. Very tasty beer. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, yet very smooth.
Drinkability: Yeah, if I could buy this locally, I would never drink any other beer as long as I live. Well worth the effort locating some bottles, would do it again and again. 778 charactersAxic10, Mar 10, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Have been saving this bottle for a couple years. Got a job offer and figured this was as good a time as any. Best by 7/8/2010. I know...getting a little inpatient, but I just couldn't wait anymore.
Served at cellar temp in my Westy chalice. Muddy brown with lots of yeasty goodness floating around. Some tan lacing just as a tease.
Smells of brown sugar, molasses, some fruit, malt. Rich and inviting although not overwhelming but increases the temptation to drink.
Taste is....well, it is the highlight. Rich malt with classic Belgian yeast. Sweet with candy sugar. Wow..every sip is different. Similar to St. Bernardus but with less alcohol taste. In fact, I can't really taste the alcohol at all. Minimal hops. Reminds me a little of something like Thomas Hardy with some age on it.
Mouthfeel is smooth, thick, creamy. Almost no carbonation. 
Drinkability, if you ignore the extreme difficulty in getting this beer, is fantastic. The alcohol sneaks into your head eventually but otherwise, I could drink this all day. Worth saving and my only regret is that I only had 1 bottle. A world-class brew! 1,106 characterstkarsies, Mar 09, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Celler Temp into a Chimay Goblet. One thousand thanks to BA member Brabander for a true act of kindness 
A: Darkened ruby with a thick 2 1/2 finger tan head that slowly settles to a beautiful halo that lasts throughout the experience. The look of pure quality.
S: Fruity and yeasty, dark buttered black breads, overripe dark fruits, and plenty of candy suger, One smell waters the mouth.
T: Powdery sweet, lively, a culmination of all the strong dark Trappist ales, the depth of Achel Extra, the soft sweetness of Rochefort 10, the rich drinkability of Chimay Grand Reserve, the clean drying finish of Koningshoeven quad. An experience I will never forget and one I wish I could revisit weekly.
M: This is where it truly sets its self apart from all others. Full and thick, it clings to the mouth but not at all cloying. I have never felt a beer like this before.
D: Warming and deeply satisfying, but lets not kid ourselves, I easily drank one, but its a dark complex wonder. I would think one would be more then enough seeing as how I spent 1 hour drinking it.
Overall it somehow lives up to the hype and delivers on all fronts. If I never drank a beer again, I could live with that.
This is my favorite style and I think it stands shoulder to shoulder with Rochefort 10 as the best Quad brewed today. 1,309 charactersJberb, Mar 08, 2010

Flavor and aroma are lots of dark fruits, with brown sugar and a lot of sweetness. Obviously this beer is well-regarded, as it should be, but to me it's just not the best beer I've had. Glad to have tried it though, and truly a unique experience. If I could get this regularly for a reasonable price, I surely would. 433 charactersPawel, Mar 05, 2010

Got a bottle in a trade, thanks stigs!
A: poured into my New Belgium Globe, It is a dark brown/slight reddish hue and with a nice tan rocky head.
S: The aroma consists of brown sugar, dark fruits and cloves. Complex
T: The taste is similar to the aroma, brown sugar, dark fruits like rasins, prunes. With a mild phenolic yeast profile, nice clove flavor. Little bit sweet. Very complex flavors that are all working together.
M: The beer is full bodied and coats your mouth. However, it is not cloying and finishes clean.
D: The drinkability is really good, this beer is just super complex and full bodied. I could drink this for days. 651 characterswalows, Mar 02, 2010
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a dark ruby with a rocky head. Aromas of candied sugar and cloves, with some raisins, dates, grapes, and currants. The burnt banana peel often attributed to it is apt. Taste is more caramelized sweetness, dark fruit, and a deep, rounded clove finish. This beer gets more flavor and complexity out of the yeast than probably any other in the world (lambics excepted). A velvety body adds wonderfully to the experience. Worth the hype and a true delight. 458 charactersgyllstromk, Mar 01, 2010

nose of ripe berries and nuts, this is a very complex brew.
taste is extraordinary and probably has the best mouthfeel of any beer I've ever had. It is scary how easy this one is to drink...at 10.2% abv, it hides it very well! I have tried this beer on 3 different occasions and it remains to be one of my favorites! 376 charactersajg83, Mar 01, 2010
4.89/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Review #300. Can't think of a better one to review than #1.
Muddy brown pour with a rich finger of foam. Nice rings of lacing on the glass.
Ridiculously complex nose. So much going on. Dark fruits, brown sugar, Belgian yeast, candi sugar, tobacco, leather...the list goes on. I'd be perfectly content just smelling this beer, but, come on, it's Westy 12. Down the hatch.
Every component of the nose shows up in the flavor. Unbelievable. Just a really earthy flavor of figs and plums, brown sugar, tobacco...light bitter finish. Outstanding flavor.
Great texture. Tingly and soft at the same time. Absolutely no hint of the ABV. Such an easy drinking quad, too. Clearly the best. 682 charactersGyle41386, Feb 28, 2010
4.58/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #600. Bottle brought back from Belgium by my wife - thanks Bryna! Served in a Westvleteren goblet. Best before February 10th, 2011, so roughly two years old.
A - Thank god! After the flat bottle I had in Toronto I was worried. The cap comes off with a hiss and a touch of gunsmoke. Pours with a voluminous two fingers of dark tan foam (impressive for a goblet!), that dissipates quite slowly and leaves glass-coating lacing and a thick cap. The body is a nearly opaque dark plum color.
S - The smell literally explodes out of the glass, with an initial wave of dark fruits and berries. Plums, prunes, raisins, black cherries - they're all here. There's some vinous red wine notes that emerge, along with a touch of sweet tobacco, apples, and nuts. There's a caramel malt backbone that ties things together, but stays in the periphery. As it warms a touch of booze peeks through to remind you that this is for sipping.
T - The taste is very grape-forward, with notes of port, red wine, dark fruits, rum-cake, and caramel. It's not as saccharine as Rochefort 10, as it's balanced by a dryish and slightly woody finish. While the taste isn't quite as complex as the nose, the alcohol is better hidden.
M - The body is chewy and viscous, without becoming heavy or syrupy. Carbonation is present, but soft. Finishes surprisingly dry with only mild residual stickiness. Not much in the way of alcohol heat at all. It's everything I'd want in a quad, and maybe even a bit more.
D - So, is it the best beer in the world? Probably not, but it's a superb one nonetheless. It's shockingly drinkable for a 10.2% quad, and I could actually have more than one of these without feeling diabetic too. There's been a lot written about this beer, and I'm not sure there's much I can add - it's excellent, highly recommended, and worthy of the acclaim that has been heaped upon it. 1,874 charactersMasterSki, Feb 27, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5We were lucky enough to have the opportunity to bring back a case of this amazing beer while visiting Belgium last fall. When I finally got to the front of the line, I asked for a case and the monk asked me, "You know you can have two?" It was very tough to take only one, but we had enough trouble getting it back. 
Poured into a Westvleteren glass, the beer is a deep brown, maybe slightly hazy but it's hard to tell. The fluffy head fades, but lingers nicely as a thin, off white layer. 
The aroma is rich, ripe dark fruit, sweet and estery with a bit of powdery yeast. Just a bit of alcohol pushes its way through.
The flavor is sweet upfront with nice dark fruity malt. A bit of sharp alcohol pushes in, but the estery sweetness fights it off. There is a bit of chalky, powdery yeast flavor in the finish, but the sweet, candied dark fruit and light herbal hops push it out. 
The flavors in this beer are extremely complex yet unified. I don't know if this is really the best beer in the world, but it is certainly one of the greats. 1,042 charactersericj551, Feb 27, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from bottle into Orval Chalice
Appearance: Dark, nearly opaque brown with a large, long-standing tan head. Foam stays.
Smell: Sweet bread and yeast notes, with grape and happle hints. Also, some slight floral aromas.
Taste: Sort of a "dirty" flavor. Yeast throughout, finishing with notes of alcohol and heavy tart apple flavors and a slight hint of red wine.
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and chewy, smooth, with balanced, natural carbonation. The finish warms you up a bit.
Drinkability: This is an absolutely outstanding beer. It tastes great, smells great, looks great, and, unsurprisingly, drinks great. If you can get your hands on this beer, do it- now.
Thanks to Brabander, who sent some bottles of this and thanks to my roommate, wahmaster, for allowing me to have one. 784 charactersMosstrooper, Feb 25, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -12.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Many thanks to deliriumfest for pulling this one out of the cellar when I was visiting. The bottle was split equally among three glasses. This is my first quad, so I may as well start at the top.
Poured an opaque and perhaps cloudy brown with a nice head that left good lacing. The predominant aroma on the nose was one of apple and a malty sweetness. Upon sipping the beer has a number of flavours each momentarily landing on the palate: fruit, light bitterness, a surprisingly sweet malt. The beer was balanced with none of the strong ABV apparent. The beer was nice, but not mindblowingly good. 
I have had better beers (that night even). 643 characterskjyost, Feb 24, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from bottle into my imperial pint glass. I split it with Gtreid! I owe him this one and soooo much more.
A- Poured a caramel color. It was brown with shades of orange. Had a frothy head that was 3/4'' of a inch. It left nice lacing on the way down.
S- Figs, malts, apples, caramel, brown sugar,molasses, and orange zest. I felt like I was in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when they were licking the candy flavored wallpaper. I couldn't wait to dive into this beer.
T- It was funny, Gtreid and I both stated at the same time that it tasted like caramel apples and apple pie. It was AMAZING! All the flavors stood out on their own yet at the same time they blended together perfectly. It seriously was a gr8 experience. I didn't get alot of alcohol in the taste and if you would've told me the ABV was 10+ I wouldn't have believed it. 
M- Nice and creamy. Perfectly balanced. I def want more!!!! 
D- I have never been happier knowing that my father in law travels to Belgium on a regular basis. I want to drink this everyday. I will def revisit this masterpiece as often as I can. 1,094 charactersurwithdave, Feb 23, 2010

This is the best Belgian beer I have had, hands down. This handles all the complex quad flavors so well it's ridiculous. It is actually hard to pick out individual flavors. I found myself saying "wow..." at just about every sip. This is a complex, rich, fruity, malty, awesome beer. The mouthfeel is so smooth, and goes down so easy. If I could get this everyday, I could easily put down a few at once. I kind of feel like I'm fueling the hype train, but it deserves it. Drank this after a Roch 10 and before a Bernardus 12, and it was head and shoulders above those two. 694 characterskhumbard, Feb 22, 2010

Westvleteren 12 is a Quadruple style Belgian ale. Pouring a beautiful rich dark caramel color with a thick frothy head it's armoa is a mix between a bakery and a ripe orchard. It tastes of fresh baked wheat bread, honey coated cinnamon, sweet cloves, sticky molasses, and ripe figs. At 10.20% ABV it is a forced to be reckoned with and demands patience and respect. 491 characterssilasmoon, Feb 20, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was definitely worried that the considerable hype would lead to disappointment - boy was I mistaken.
A: Poured a dark hazy copper brown with a rich one finger head that receded to a light cap with thick lacing.
S: Very complex with notes of malt, molasses, figs, cloves, butter, bananas, yeast, and alcohol. There was an earthy undercurrent hidden at the bottom - almost like mushrooms. For me, the aromas were intense at the beginning and remained strong throughout the tasting.
T: Wow! Incredibly smooth with a multitude of extremely well layered notes. Dry with sweet caramel maltiness and cloves. Notes of molasses and sugars with rich fruits like bananas, raisins, and figs. Mellow butterscotch notes with hints of yeast followed by citrusy bitterness. Sweet malty residue on the lips at the end.
M: Decadently smooth and creamy. Full bodied with decent carbonation.
D: I could drink many. The alcohol is well hidden - a true delight! 941 charactersspratmi, Feb 20, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle courtesy of Harpreet..Pours mahogany, semi-cloudy, with a medium tan head that leaves only a little bit behind. Awesome aroma of dark fruits (plum, date, raisin, fig), caramel, malts, spices, and faint alcohol. The flavor lives up to the nose, with the same dark fruits, caramel, and malts, as well as mild spices, nuts, wood, and warming alcohol. Medium bodied, really smooth, and alcohol is pretty subdued for being 10%. It's hard to find flaws in this one- maybe the body is thin for the style, and the color isn't the most beautiful shade of mahogany. But those are just tiny observations that mean virtually nothing compared to this beer as a whole. I never thought this could live up to the hype, but it absolutely satisfied all expectations. I can't wait to visit the place someday and try some there. 815 charactershophead247, Feb 15, 2010

A: Slightly cloudy caramel copper color. The pour drops a nickel size kahki head thAt leaves some nice spidery lace.
A: smells of rich caramel, canddied figs, and sweet apple pie. Earthy hops and just a ton of sweet malt.
T: I don't think a quad could taste any better. Sweet malt, candy, apples, figs, and caramel. The flavor profile is just out of this world. Finishes sweet and dry with no hint of the abv.
M: Creamy, smooth, and absolutely perfect. Aggressive carbonatin delivers the flavor nicely.
D and overall impression: I could drink this all night, it really doesn't get any better. Overall this is one of the best brews I have ever had. Simply amazing! Skal. 804 charactersGtreid, Feb 14, 2010

A: Pours an almost pitch black liquid with a thick, slightly beige fluffy head. Nice head retention. The beer almost looks like a Bordeaux around the edges of the glass and leaves an outstanding lacing. Viscous and creamy
S: Satisfying alcohol nose. Port wine, red grapes, dates and a slight belgian yeast aroma. Spicy; pepper and clove. Slitghly acidic dark malt and brown sugar. Extremely smooth and beautiful smell! I could smell this for ages and be a very happy man....
T: ....wow. I mean, really, WOW. VERY good beer. Once again, I get port wine and a great warming alcohol thing. Dates and figs. Perfectly balanced, some noble hop-like aromas in the finish and slightly dry bitterness. Very smooth on the palate. I'd never guess it was over 10% ABV thanks to the expceptionally soothing mouthfeel. Very spicy, exotically peppery and bitter orange peel in the finish. All flavors I pick up are perfectly balanced to one another, none of them are dominant in a bad way. Chocolate, molasses, brown sugar - sweet but not too sweet. That's how we like it!
M/D: Very creamy and full-bodied, yet exceptionally drinkable for the style. Smooth and warming with perfect CO2. I expected a bigger head though. Without a doubt a winner nonetheless! Hit the perfect serving temp smack down IMHO.
Probably one of the best beers in the world, regardless of the hype. Fantastic, and very unique, flavor. Too bad I don't have more... :'( 1,526 characterskrunchie, Feb 12, 2010

Appearance: Pours a dark black color with reddish edges. Has a large foamy head that dissipates slowly and leaves a ton of lacing.
Smell: Very complex. Has hints of dark fruits, grapes, citrus, spice, caramel, and many other things. Very strong-smelling.
Taste: Has an intense wine-like taste up front that finishes sweet with hints of caramel. Also finishes with a heavy alcoholic bite. Also has that typical yeasty flavor typical of most Belgian beers. This is one of the most complex and flavorful beers I've had yet.
Mouthfeel: Relatively full-bodied with a nice carbonation bite. Kinda was expecting more here but I'm not that disappointed.
Drinkability: A truly world-class brew. I'm deeply grateful to brabander for the opportunity to try this one. If you can get your hands on it, try it!! 896 characterswahhmaster, Feb 07, 2010

A - Yeasty, dark brown, and hazy. Much darker than I expected. Thin head, a skim coat of bubbles on the surface.
S - Smells largely like bread dough as its rising. Quite yeasty, the slightest touch buttery, cereal grains. Much different than I expected, but quite good.
T - Hmm, not at all what I was expecting, but very good. Sweet up front, a bit of root beer, sugary, some cola. Yeasty, bready, some belgian yeast character. Quite different from other quads I've had, but definitely very nice. A unique experience.
M - Somewhat on the thin side of medium bodied. Carbonation isn't particularly high, but is definitely right for this beer. Somewhat creamy in feel, and a bit soda-like also.
D - Very drinkable beer, especially for a quad. I typically find quads to be a bit rough and very much a sipper of a beer. Not this one...flavors are strong but balanced...nothing hot about this from an alcohol standpoint. Very drinkable...excellent. 1,042 charactersportia99, Feb 07, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Received this in trade from ZymasefungiI207I, much thanks. Had this with my wife and two of my best friends. Poured from a bottle into a tulip, it pours a moderate brown that is quite hazy and basically opaque. A light tan head forms and sticks around leaving a mild lacing. Carbonation is readily visible.
The aroma is where this begins to take off for me. Nice notes of grass and sweet malty, almost candy component. Complex and difficult to fully delineate, almost cotton candy-ish but very good.
The taste is a great mixture of spices, as well as a fruity sweetness that seems to be primarily grape. Very complex but tasty with a firm malty sweet backbone that seems to boost the spices. Alcohol is noticeable.
The mouthfeel is medium/full bodied. The sweetness goes down fairly smoothly and leaves a mild dry/bitterness at the finish. Just the right amount of carbonation.
This beer is very drinkable. The ABV actually makes it a bit dangerous but yum in every respect. Again, much thanks for the beer and I hope many people continue to enjoy. 1,052 charactersSykDoc, Feb 07, 2010

4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Ahhhh the legendary Westy 12. Pulled out my last bottle of this at a recent tasting of friends. Poured into a wonderful Cantillon snifter/wine glass thing that said friends gave me for a Christmas/Birthday gift.
A - Poured a slightly-viscous brown with a thin but long lasting head.
S - Amazingly complex. Figs, malt, raisins, and dates. I spent a good 2 minutes just smelling this beer. It truly is a great smell, my favorite quad tied with St. Bernardus 12, which is amusing and expected, given their history.
T - Amazing fruit and malt flavors, like a hyped up dubbel. Fruits similar to fig, dried orange and the aforementioned raisins. There is nary a hint of alcohol here, it's just very well balanced and masked by the flavors here.
M / D - Mouthfeel here deserves some special attention: This is just chewy and moist, an incredible refreshing mouthfeel to this. Wonderfully drinkable as I wish I had more than my 5 ounce pour on this.
So, is it the end all be all? The ratings don't lie: This is an amazing beverage. I think the rarity and mystique probably add to the experience, but believe the hype: This beer deserves the acclaim. 1,146 charactersmutterfudder, Feb 01, 2010
4.55/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A good beer, like a good wine, must exist in time. This is to say, it must be good at the moment you have it, but also good in the scheme of beers as a whole such that as new styles and techniques evolve it remains well regarded and enjoyable. The fact that this one has acquired a nickname (Westy) is a testament to this. Out of a bottle provided by BA members (THANK YOU!) this legend was a deep, copper color with burgundy highlights. It was visibly viscous, leaving good streaks of lacing off the well-retained head. The aroma was complex and demanding; a sensual blend of ripe plums, dates and dark fruits galore. Behind that was alcohol (esp. dark rum), chocolate, spices and the pungent twist of Belgian yeast. The flavors were just as big and layered. Chocolate, more dark fruits, coffee hints, raisins, wood, cinnamon, figs etc. etc. The doughy notes were hard to discern under the other heavier elements but the impact was like an alcohol soaked fruitcake. Despite the depth of the beer it was indeed a brew with finesse and a good finish. Easy to drink? No. It's rich and intense. Pleasant to drink? Yes, especially if you love beer. A casual drinker could be run over by this thing. The mouthfeel was good and creamy but not amazing, the body full without being heavy and the carbonation right on. Relatively drinkable for all that is has to offer and a genuine joy for the advanced palate. In short, this delivered on every level including living up to its reputation and if you can find it, do so. 1,511 charactersthekevlarkid, Jan 31, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5After a night of disappointing beers, I figured this was the perfect moment to pull this one out. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Rochefort chalice. Bottled March 2008.
A- Pours a dark burgundy. Semi-clear. The bits of yeast that poured into the glass seemed to be suspended in the glass, absolutely motionless...even after I shook the glass. Produced a fingers width of off-white head. Some lacing and good head retention. 
S- Exactly what I want in a quad. Nice sweet malt backbone with an influence of various dark fruits. Picking up figs and raisins. Very balanced and restrained.
T- As soon as the beer touches the palate, figs and raisins give off a sweet, fruit flavor...very mellow and just divine. As it settles, more of the malt flavors come out, adding a depth of sweetness. There's a slight bitterness in the finish. All the flavors mesh together perfectly...extremely balanced.
M- If there is a part of this beer that separates it from others in this style, this is it. Medium bodied with perfect viscosity for a quad. The carbonation gave it a fuller mouthfeel.
D- Nothing out of place, just smooth and balanced. The high alcohol is kept in check by the other flavors. Very easy to drink for a big beer.
Is this the best beer in the world? Absolutely not. Is this beer the best quad in the world? Debatable. Are the ratings influenced by hype? Without a doubt. That being said, this is a high quality beer. Flavors and ingredients are very much in synch...I can't explain it, but the mouthfeel is honestly what makes this beer. If you could equate the feel of velvet on the skin, that's what the texture of the beer felt like on the palate. Bottom line, good shit! However, I will not go out of my way to pay $20 for a 12 oz. bottle.
EDIT: the more and more I drink this, the more I realize how ridiculous the mouthfeel is. Truly a thing of beauty. 1,872 charactersrhinos00, Jan 30, 2010

A- Nice brown with ruby highlights and great head that goes to a little bit of foam that lingers. With carbonation that very slowly churns in the center. It laces the glass very nicely. 
S- I get a nice boutique of fruits like apples, grape, and raisin. Caramel, molasses with a little burn of alcohol but in no way bad. The grape and raisin bite harder in the end. Good sweet malts and yeast and loving the brown sugar.
T- The nice complex fruit tastes like the apples, mixed grapes, caramel, molasses, yeastiness, and light on the pepper. Nice sweet malts, a bit of leather and wood. It's definitely a complex beer.
M- Nice full body with a nice chewy bite to it. Also a little bubbly in the back.
D- It's definitely a sit down and talk beer, but I could definitely drink several. It's one of those that are so good you just want to sip on to make it last. 931 charactersWinters, Jan 27, 2010

4.55/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5330ml bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. It is fitting that I have finally sampled this beer in my fifth year of 'serious' craft drinking, on the dawn of a new year with an ambitious set of beer goals for 2010. Since I approached this beer with respect and humility, rather than overloaded expectations, I was thoroughly satisfied with the experience.
Pours a purplish, burgundy brown with ruby red hues and a bubbly ring of tan head. Spotted lacing covers the top half of the glass. 
Smell is doughy malts, baking yeast, caramelized fruit, candy sugar, and a trace of alcohol. 
Taste is a lovely mix of blueberries, plums, apple cider, prunes and chocolate chips. There's a prominent vinous flavour, very wine-like in character, imparting dark grapes with a touch of tartness. Finish contains a hint of alcohol, boozy and warming. Spicy, fruity bite from the hops with a quick flash of bitterness to end. In a word, delicious.
The mouthfeel is in a category of its own. Lush, resinous, and silky in texture, with a pronounced creaminess in the body. Velvety and clean, yet chewy at the same time. Dangerously drinkable for 10.2%.
It took me an hour to properly savour this brew as the complexity is nearly unparalleled. Like most BAs, I prefer a handful of beers over Westy 12, but it's still a beast that needs to be tamed at some point in your craft beer journey. I feel extremely fortunate to have tried this legendary quad. A tasty and luxurious treat, deserving of its world class status. 1,498 characterscratez, Jan 10, 2010

Pours a medium brown with a beige head. The aroma is dark fruit along with some alcohol and caramel malt. The flavor is complex with brown sugar and dark fruit. This has a little more alcohol flavor than some quads but everything is nicely balanced. Medium mouthfeel and extremely drinkable.
Not sure if this is the best beer in the world, but there are certainly no flaws. Thanks again to thirdeye11. 602 charactersMora2000, Jan 03, 2010

the fact that this beers reputation precedes itself goes without saying in this forum, so objectivity in reviewing needs to be at its best
btw, beer (not review) number 1000 for me, not a bad choice for that milestone
A - cola brown without the transparencey, plenty of visible sediment, an easy pour wells up a finger of off white head, too dark for noting visible carbonation 
S - bready, yeasty malt aromas are what I first detect, some lingering sweetness, similar to dark fruits, especially figs, dates and raisins, some fainter more sugary sweetness as well, like brown sugar or molasses
T - geez, where to start... yeasty bready maltiness still leads the way, then those dark fruits bridge the gap to the finish, fresh fruits, more like figs than dried dates or raisins, some fresh anise, the finish arrives with the more sugary sweetness, molasses, and brown sugar, the beer leaves a overripe dark red grape fresh off the vine kind of aftertase
M&D - incredibly smooth and complex in both aroma and taste, this beer at least meets the hype, I'll leave "excedes the hype" to the individual. I wouldnt say this was the best beer i have ever had, but it was incredibly good, and worth the cost to try at least once 1,259 characterssinstaineddemon, Jan 03, 2010

Shared with some of my lifelong friends in goblets...
A - handsome deep ruby, clear until the bottle became slighlty disturbed which led to some magical yeasty chunks. No head, thick, no lacing. (new sample had a monster head with heavy lacing)
S - caramel, raisiny, figs, slightly winey yet sweet (new sample - not winey)
T - sweet caramel, slight winey sour - just like the aroma. In my mind I was trying to compare this against a Rochefort 10 or SB12, but this was way different. (new sample did not have any sourness)
M - smooth, syrupy, low carbonation, but left a tingling on my tongue. 
D - wish I could have more, will call this drinkable, availability is a slight problem, but very drinkable. 
I was very excited to share this with my bests... Great beer - yes, best in the world - no, at least not this sample. Would like to assess this further with more samples.
UPDATE: Freshie from Belgium (thanks Riggsy), and much, much better. The mouthfeel, much much more in the line of what was expected!

12oz bottle served in a DeKoninck chalice.
Murky brown color with a foamy beige head that hung on as a layer and left spots of lace all over the place.

4.79/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52005 vintage. This poured a hazy mahogany with moderate light tan head. It smelled like strong sweet brown sugar and caramel and creamy yeast, with some banana nut bread and milk chocolate and confectioners sugar and raisin. It tasted like toffee and brown sugar and raisin and banana nut bread, with creamy yeast and cocoa powder and chalky confectioners sugar. It was oily with smooth carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was amazingly sweet (malty) and complex. It really is one of the best Belgian ales ever. It had a delicious scent and taste, with great body. The alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink, but it definitely needs to be sipped to be fully savored. I'm curious how this tastes fresh, but I don't know when I'll ever find out. Regardless, this beer meets the hype. Fantastic. 826 charactersPencible, Dec 31, 2009

Scents are very complex, lots of stuff going on, but could detect plums, raisins, toffee. The taste is very very nice, I believe I've had nothing like this so far. Nice tart/tangy/sweet flavor. Could taste plums/grapes I think. The finish is dry and clean. Medium body, well rounded, with a carbonated feel. Very drinkable. This is my first Westy, and what a powerful/excellent/awesome brew. Just might have to try and get some soon. 610 charactersAnthony1, Dec 31, 2009

A - Emerged from the bottle as a chunky, muddy-looking brown, earthy color with half an inch of bubbly beige head that retained well but only left some spotty lace that slid down the sides of the glass.
S - Sweet and malty aroma with lots of dark fruit tang suggesting raisins, plums and dark wine-like grapes. Toffee and caramel notes are also abundant. Floral hop notes add a bit of contrast, but work nicely with the sweetness of the nose. Subtle honey notes also opened up as the liquid reached room temperature. 
T - My initial take is that this reminds me of a liquid Heath bar. Uber-toffee notes dominate, while caramel candies and sugary sweet notes mingle with more slightly bittersweet licorice notes and a mild floral hop bitterness. 
M - Thick and syrupy with a solid medium body and very sparse carbonation. Finishes sweet with a hint of bitterness on the palate.
D - Yes this is a great Quad to say the least, but is it THE best beer in the world? Well, perhaps not in my humble opinion, but still this is an excellent Quad. 1,109 charactersffejherb, Dec 30, 2009
4.17/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4For a beer that is so hard to get there sure is a lot of us BA's reviewing it. Time to add my two cents.. This westy 12 pours leathery brown with strong caps of white suds on top. The last third of the pour starts to get a murky. Gritty, chunky, yeasty stuff escapes the bottle and into my glass. I'm ok with that, it's all part of the Belgian experience.
Wow the smell is pretty amazing. Dark candied sugars dissolved in honey, molasses and rum soaked raisins with a peppery, bready punch. The previous sentence packed with descriptions is the only way to portray the nose. Each whiff has so much going on, each time I smell something a little different.
The taste is also quite satisfying and quite layered like the nose. Sweet, caramelized malts with candied sugar. Following are hints of spices, dark fruits and a touch of booziness. It is a little too sweet for my taste but I still give it high marks for the flavors pushing through that sweetness.
The mouthfeel is very smooth with a nice peppery kick in the finish. It's heavier then I expected but not chewy like a stout. Lightly carbonated and full bodied with a dry boozy warmth in the finish.
I try not to buy into the hype but I honestly think it somewhat sways my senses. I honestly can't be sure if it made me more critical or more flexible but what I am sure of is that this is a very good beer. It's not my favorite and not as good as Rochefort 10 but it is up there. What it's not, is worth the hype. I wouldn't pass up another one but I would not actively search it out again. There are far better beers that are readily available here in the States. 1,623 charactersjbphoto88, Dec 29, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Review #100. Glad I finally started documenting the beers I've tasted lately!! Here's to the next 100!
The myth, the legend. A beer that sat in my cellar wanting to be opened. Its siren song always calls out, now it must be answered.
Split with family - 4 oz or so in my New Belgium globes. Looks great, caramel brown with a small head that quickly disappears.
Smell is amazing. Plums, grapes, chocolate malt, alcohol, caramel.
Taste is what makes this #1. Is it similar to others like St. Bernardus? Yes, but NO. To say yes would be to liken a Lexus to a Bentley. Both are very nice cars (I'd drive either in a heartbeat) but only one is truly a marvel of engineering and craft. A spicey taste shocks the palatte. A wave of caramel and nutty malt is surfed by a grape/plum taste that never truly "fades". The lingering taste has more dark fruit and yeasty elements, then finally subsides. This is a marvel of taste engineering - the flavor just embodies the word "refined". Something for everyone in this beer, not surprised at all that it's so highly regarded.
Mouthfeel is amazing. It's velvet on the tongue, great body and carb support the flavor explosion. Wow. Wow. Wow. Best mouthfeel ever perhaps.
Drinkability is also unheard-of. To be blessed with great friends, great beers, and great memories is what life is about. This is a beer to celebrate the best of all life has to offer! 1,396 charactersjampics2, Dec 28, 2009

4.25/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into one of my goblets.
Pours a small 1/2 finger of tan head. Color is a very hazed murky caramel brown. Head fizzles down to a thin layer fast. Leaves some lace.
Smell is very complex with bready and caramel malts. Cherries, plums, and other dark dried fruits present. Also some booze and silk chocolate in the aroma. Toffee notes, figs, and Belgian candi sugar.
Taste: Chocolate, cherries, plums, raisins, apples, and some heat. Caramel and bready malts. Pretty solid brew. I also get the toffee, figs, and candi sugar again. Petty malty brew.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Feels very creamy and smooth. Ends a little dry but doesn't have a lot of heat as most quads do.
Overall, is it worth it? I would have to say sort of. Is it good? Yes. I really like this quad because it isn't so boozy as compared to a lot of the other quads I have had. It is worth a try. A lot of nice flavors in this beer. A bit slow drinking, however. 972 charactersmothman, Dec 24, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally. I've been craving this since my first day on BA. Lots of thanks to the lady friend for getting this for my b-day. Awesome present. Here goes nothing. Opens with a great hiss, poured into my Westy glass.
Appearance - A nice deep ruby, brown. Chestnut. An inch of creamy tan head. It settles into a nice quarter inch cap that isn't going anywhere. Looks great. That cap isn't going anywhere. The cap is there for the duration. Great lacing. 
Smell - A little subdued at first. Lots of nice yeast. A sweet malty smell as well. Nutty, definitely. Some dark fruit. Hint of raisin, more plum. Fresh baked black bread. 
Taste - A very nice complex taste right off the bat. Cherry, definitely. And some grape. Sweet nuttiness. Can definitely taste the booze, in a nice way. It has a warm, boozy finish. I'd love this on a cold day. Vinous, surprisingly. Almost a hint of citrus. This has a lot of things that those barrel-aged, blended, crazy concoctions have, but in just a simple, natural way. Complex, but clean flavors. 
Mouthfeel - Nice carbonation. Just a hint, a tiny hint, on the thin side. Still excellent. 
Drinkability - Too damn good. Trying to slow down to let it warm up. 
An excellent, exceptional beer. It may not be the best beer I've ever had, but I certainly understand why so many believe that it is. I may prefer the Abt 12, but this is about as good as it gets. 1,390 characterscallmescraps, Dec 18, 2009
4.89/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5We all know it's reputation and beer geek admiration. There is no special occasion as to why I'm drinking this special beer. 
The basement was at just about the right temp, but I put it in the fridge for about 10 minutes to get it to the low 50 degrees. The cap came off with a very short escape of air. The cap has 100 08007 on it or 08/10/07 as a best by date, but I can attest to this beer being properly stored? A lot of dead yeast remain in the bottle and settled there with my slow pour. I almost want to give a 4.5 based on reputation alone, but I can't. 
A: The carbonation is looking a little sparse, a small 0.5 cm head that slowly settles into swirls atop the Chimay glass. There is a nice lace ring that stays on the outside. The beer has a dark brown/plum color that doesn't let the UV rays through. Good looking color, but was expecting a bigger Belgian head, perhaps the age of the beer can be the cause of that?
S: A behemoth aroma on this beer: Complexly sweet with vinous grapes, rum soaked cherries, raisin skins, anything dark 'n' sweet under the sun really. In addition to this there is a molasses like sweetness that is paired with some spice and black licorice.
T: Not the prettiest thing to look at, but my what a complex flavor profile. I find immediate gratification as it touches my tongue. The aroma was amazing and the taste is equally complex, but in a largely understated way. Up front is muted grapes and raisins that prospers into other an almost prolonged honey, berry, sugary finish with the tiniest amount of burn maybe due to the age. The taste isn't aggressive and I find it pretty divinely smooth.
M: The mouf of this beer is thick bodied and exceptionally creamy.
D: This beer is pretty rather divine and I am almost tempted to try and fetch another few bottles. I almost did not want to like this beer going into it because of its scarcity and it always seems like a faux pas to give into "the best". A complex aroma and a smooth/mellow flavor (appropriating this to the age of the beer) made for a great experience. 2,063 charactersMPLS, Dec 15, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I approach the Westy 12 with a little trepidation. I've tried all of the currently available Trappist beers except for the Westvleterens and my experience has been mixed.
There have been some good beers, to be sure. The Rochefort 10, Chimay Red, Koningshoeven Dubbel and Achel Blonde are all tasty beers which I'll be trying again, but the others have been less inspiring, some even disappointing, given the weight of expectation. Could it be true that some of the Trappist ales aren't what they used to be? As a newcomer to strong Belgian beer, I can't really say.
However, I couldn't pass up the chance to try the legendary Westvleteren 12 when the opportunity presented itself (thanks, Thijs!). Could it possibly live up to its reputation? After leaving upright for the recommended eight days (!) to allow the sediment to settle, I cracked open the bottle...
I used an entirely inappropriate Young's pint glass - useful for containing large heads while maintaining a single-action pour that gets maximum beer with minimum chance of sediment contamination. Except that the Westy pours with only a small head for such a strong beer (unlike, say, Duvel, whose foam creeps inexorably out of the freshly opened bottle like an amorphous alien life form oozing from its lair). The sediment is so dark that it's easy to stop the pour before it escapes.
The beer is a dark bronze and slightly hazy in the glass. The taste is an explosion of dark fruit, Christmas cake, molasses and toffee, with a wine-like intensity that nevertheless masks the full extent of the alcohol (over 10% ABV). There's plenty of rich malt, but the hops put in a decent appearance too. The mouthfeel is luxurious, and I like the low carbonation. There's a great balance between bitterness and a slight sweetness. The aftertaste is a thing of wonder, retaining a huge amount of the original flavour, giving you the impression that you haven't actually swallowed the mouthful yet, even though you have. Some beer, even the very strong rich Belgians, tastes good but seems to have some element missing. The Westy satisfies across the entire taste spectrum. Liquid bread? Liquid banquet, more like.
My wife, raised on much milder English ales and suspicious of anything over 6% ABV, helped me drink this with gusto.
I didn't want to disappoint my supplier by telling him I found it merely pleasant, but I needn't have worried - its reputation is justified. This is my favourite Trappist beer, without a doubt. The hype, the cachet, the rarity: all of these are irrelevant. It simply tastes better than all the others. My favourite ever beer? Probably not, but it's fairly close.
Incidentally, when you pour this, make sure none of the sediment gets through. Once I'd finished my glass, I went back and poured the last inch or so through a paper kitchen towel, hoping to filter out the sediment and get another few sips. I failed and ended up with a very hazy last inch. It didn't taste the same: drinkable, but the complexity was gone. Other beers (St. Austell Clouded Yellow, for example) seem quite tolerant to this, but not the Westy. Remember: store upright for eight days and leave the black sludge in the bottle! 3,191 charactersfroglord, Dec 13, 2009

Pours a rich deep golden/amber/ruby with a thing light fluffy head, surprisingly still there on the '95 but more subtle than on the '09. Nose is very complex, slight booze - but not much for a 10.2% beer. Has quite a bit of sweetness, and on the '95 a ton of rum/raisin as well.
Taste is very crisp and sweet and it's got some complex grain/earthy flavors. Light belgian yeastiness to it with raisins dominating the flavor. The '95 as much more mellow and drinkable/smooth but the '09 was very bright and sharp, both were excellent! 663 characterskingcrowing, Dec 13, 2009

S- Large fruity aroma, cherries, apples, peaches and plums. Also a great malty profile displaying Caramel, roasted pecans and a touch of molasses. The yeast really makes this beer shine with some nice spicy notes to balance all the sweet malty character. 
T- Spicy fruit up front then some roasted nuts and fruit are accompanies by dry bitter spice, warming alcohol and a slight peppery flavor. Cherries, raspberries make an appearance in the flavor as well. This is a very complex and tasty beer. 
M- This is a full bodied beer with a nice oily smoothness and dry bitter bite in the end. The alcohol is a little apparent for my taste. 
Overall this is a great quad, and a great beer in general. 918 charactersbr3wmeister, Dec 07, 2009
4.69/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I am so freakin happy, I finally get to try this beer. This beer is my 500th review. It has been sitting in my cellar for almost a year. I had to beg borrow and almost steal to get someone one to trade me for this beer. When I got this beer there were far fewer reviews. I know everybody wants this beer so tonight is my night to either defeat the hype or promote it. Poured into a a tulip glass at 45 degrees. 
Appearance: The head is a light tan one finger and has good retention. The head is creamy and frothy and left lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is a very dark brown color and is very hard to distinguish. The clarity of the beer is opaque and hazy. 
Nose: A rich fruity aroma with alcohol presents. There is a peppery, cloves, bananas, phenols, and yeast/bread. There is so much going on in the beer that I could have missed something or some compound. In the back ground of the beer there is some solvent and sweetness. 
Taste: A very deep rich fruity malty flavors. The flavors are peppery, cloves, yeasty bread, phenols and banana. There is a lot going on in the flavors. In the background of the beer there is some alcohol warmth and some sweetness. 
Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated, warming, and smooth. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium to medium full. This beer is fantastic, it has so much going on in it, yet it is so simple. The flavor explode in your mouth and is very easy to drink. The head was disappointing, nonetheless, the flavor makes up for it. I am so glad that I got to try it. It is just amazing. 1,570 characterscolts9016, Dec 01, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5All I can say is... FINALLY!
A - Dark hazy brown body beneath a thick and fluffy slightly offwhite head. Fantastic retention, the head lasts a solid 4-5 minutes then settles to a 1/4-inch foamy cap that lasts the duration of the beer. Wonderful sticky lacing.
S - Really, really nice and strong aroma. Dark malts, dark chocolate, and then alcohol soaked fruits such as cherries and plums. Slight pruney aroma with a deep breath. Some nice spices in there, almost like all spice, and then peppery perhaps from the alocohol.
T&M - Very peppery taste on the tip of my tongue at first sip then the dark fruits come through very intensely. Definite alcohol soaked cherries and more prune than plum coming through. Lightly sweet but not overly so. The spicey alcohol and smooth dark malts mellow out the sweetness. Nice kick of Belgian yeast as the beer is swallowed and again the alcohol throws pepper at you as it is swallowed. Dark bread crust lingers in the aftertaste with just a touch of cherries. Moderate/high carbonation gives this a dry feel but not overly spritzy or champaign-like. Somewhat sticky on the lips and tongue keeps this from being overly dry. Balanced and complex are the best words for this beer.
D - Obviously a sipper but goes down really well. So complex in the flavors and develops nicely as it warms to room temperature. The alcohol is noticable in the spicey flavor it gives but does not come across boozy, so I think I could easily do two of these. A pleasure to drink and I really would like to have this again and would love to cellar a few as well to see what age will do. 1,605 charactersMrIncognito, Nov 30, 2009

4.81/5  rDev +4.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I have been looking forward to this one for a while and split a couple with some great friends and family. Poured into a Chimay Goblet
A: Murky brown like a dark apple cider. Lots of sediment in the glass when viewed in the light. The head was only about a quarter inch thick and did not retain very well but a nice layer of white foam remains on top of the beer throughout.
S: This smelled fantastic. Rich toffee and caramel were pretty dominant. It also smelled a bit like a caramel covered green apple. The green apple esters were very pleasant. There was a mild amount of booziness and a great gram cracker note. 
T: The taste was very similar to the smell. What really impressed me was the complexity of this beer. My favorite part was definitely the gram cracker. Also a nice mild grape and green apple note balance out the sweetness from the candied sugar.
M: Very impressed by the creaminess os this beer. I was very pleased that it was not cloying sweet. 
D: Definitely worth the hype behind it. I dont know if I could drink this everyday, but it is worth it 1,072 charactersmikey711, Nov 30, 2009
4.33/5  rDev -6.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've been sitting on this beer for a special occasion. Well fellow BA BeerFMAndy shares the same birthday with myself so I believe that qualifies. 
Poured and split into two tulip glasses the beer is a muddy cinnamon hue with about an inch of creamy tan head. The head settles leaving slight ring of slippery lace. 
The aroma is tad more subdued then I had expected. Candied fruit, brown sugar, fresh baked bread and maybe a hint of spice. Still not the olfactory monster I had hoped for.
The flavor is caramel malt up front. With sweet candied fruit, cocoa, toffee, cinnamon toast and a touch of bitter fruit in the finish. Dryer and more tart then I would have imagined. 
Medium creamy body with moderate carbonation. Basic quad feel.
Overall not quite the mind blowing experiance I had envisioned for the number one beer. A good beer that I would love to revisit. I'm glad I was able to share this with a friend for our birthdays. 938 charactersbeerwolf77, Nov 29, 2009

Many, many thanks to a generous friend; Todd aka Beerwolf77
Happy shared birthday Todd!
A - Clear dark amber with caramel hints and a low, creamy dense head that formed off an aggressive/tall pour into the center of the glass. Good retention with a bit of lacing that tries hard to cling to the glass despite my constant swirling.
S - The aroma is deep and mysterious with toasted, bread-like malts that fade in and out of the foreground complimented by a low but persistent dark fruit nose of raisin, grape, and prune. A bit of dark candi sugar and brown sugar too. Small amounts of spice poke through with the low alcohol nose. Very mild and not hot or fusel at all. The nose is much better and open after a few good swirls, otherwise its a bit timid.
T - Lightly toasted, bready malts that have a really good smooth feel with a mellow candi sugar and brown sugar flavor with lots of dark fruits in the background. Raisin, grape, prune, and dark cherry. A fantastic tasting, mellow quad. Tiny hints of spice with almost no alcohol flavor for its percent. Again, I only wish the flavor was just a SMALL bit more upfront.
M - Super-smooth like velvet and medium-full bodied. A lasting sweetness with a very small bitterness to the finish. Mellow overall and well carbonated but its so complex and smooth otherwise I didn't even think about it.
D - An incredibly easy drinking beer, especially for a Belgian Quad. After all the hype of being the "number one beer" I think I'm a little disenchanted with it. A great beer, that's to be certain of, but had I not had the expectations I had, I'm sure I would have found it to be much better. Still an incredible beer I wish I could get more frequently.
Another huge thanks to Todd for sharing this with me for our shared birthday! 1,912 charactersBeerFMAndy, Nov 29, 2009
4.13/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to the bar manager for informing me this was on the 'secret' menu. Bottle pours a dark ruby brown with a little bit of foam. Tastes of very strong dark fruits with lots of flavour that lingers on the tongue. Its quite easy to drink considering the abv%. Its a decent beer, but it didn't wow me away being the number one rated beer in the world. Glad I got to try this though.
Got to try this again thanks to Jeffo. Very solid quad. It tasted a little hot at first, but it settled and became very drinkable. Lots of brown sugar and dark fruits in the flavour. 566 charactersWeedKing4, Nov 28, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to Brabender for affording me the opportunity to try this rare and profound brew. 
Pours a deep nutty brown with a smallish head that dissipates rather quickly. I don't feel that the smaller head really counts much against it as a smoother, creamier, less carbonated mouthfeel is achieved through the lack of huge bubbliness. 
The smell offers up a fine aroma of plum, pear, and sweet malt. It is not a nose that hits you over the head, but neither is the taste really. This ale is about subtlety, depth, and the interplay of flavors. 
The taste is pretty deep. Dark fruity flavors are up front, such as plum and raisin. Alcohol is noticeable, but not nearly as strong as one might expect given the high ABV. Fruity flavors, toasty malts, and sweet belgian sugars all stand up over the high alcohol content. The taste has a special kind of depth that allows you to get into it it further and further the more you drink it. 
The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, especially for such high ABV. A light carbonation is there, but not the dominant element. The alcohol doesn't burn too much, but it does numb the tongue slightly. I found all of this to be very pleasant and complimentary to the flavor. 
Drinkability, what can I say? Very, very drinkable. Probably the most drinkable ale at this ABV that I have had. It compares very favorably overall to other Belgians that I've had, though I still need to try a couple of the classics. I just had a nice Maredsous 8 on draft at the Renaissance fair here in Texas and it was lovely but it didn't have the depth of character that this Westvleteren exhibited. This ale is a classic for sure. I don't know if it's the best in the world, but it's certainly in my top few beers I've tried. 1,745 charactersEverdrift, Nov 28, 2009
3.27/5  rDev -29.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2 |  overall: 3.5Appearance: dark mahogany and... OH no! not a trace of a head!!!
Smell: Sweet candi sugar. Good malt in the nose. Minimal hops. Slight vanilla twang.
Taste: NOOO! this is supposed to be the holy grail!! It is overwhelmingly sweet. It has some redeeming qualities however. It is malty with some complex vanilla flavors. 
unfortunately it tastes somewhat like the sweet unfermented mash. 
Mouthfeel: thin, thin, thin, Not a trace of carbonation.
Drinkability: If this is the holy grail its one and done for me. I hope that I have been duped and I bought one of those counterfeit beers. I have one more in the cellar (my closet). Will edit my review if this was just a bad bottle. 677 charactersdigitalbullet, Nov 26, 2009
4.79/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5A massive thanks to Goldorak for giving me this treasure, hand delivering it no less. Yer a gentleman and a prince Martin! Bottlecap is dated 06.04.07.
Pours out a deep, nearly opaque murky brown in appearance, thin, quick creamy tan head that disappears quickly.
Well then, the aroma is absolutely gorgeous, if this is as good as it gets, then I'm content. Rich, vinous dark dried fruit, brown sugar, light caramel, plum and candi sugar, mild alcohol warmth and spice.
Bready, nutty, some toffee in the malt up front, sweet sugary alcohol warmth, candy-like berry sweetness and vinous dark fruit. Finish is dry, sweet yet earthy, low alcohol warmth into the aftertaste, spicy with a Turkish Delight savoury sweetness. I had this at a 4.5 starting out, but really, near the end of the glass, this is some 5 star flavour as good as and greater than the sum of its parts.
Mouthfeel is the only slight against it, thin and a bit watery, very low carbonation with some light stickiness.
One of those few beers that lives up to its hype and delivers, certainly does not disappoint, I now know the exemplar to hold all other quads up to. Wow.... Once again thanks to Goldorak, how am I gonna follow this one up? 1,210 charactersIronDjinn, Nov 26, 2009
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally had the oppertunity to devour a bottle of the holy grail of beers...aged 2 years mind you. I tried hard to have low expectations since a lot of Belgians beers have been letting me down lately. Better too to be pleasantly surprised than let down.
Let down? That didn't happen.
A: Medium dark brown with decent head. 
S: From the moment the bottle was cracked open...the aroma was so strong, it filled the room and made my mouth start watering. Very strong Belgian strong dark ale/quad smell. Lots of dark sweet malts and fruits. A slight wine smell on the backside.
T: Just like the smell. Very complex. Tons of dark overripe fruits, sugars, slight booze, smooth.
I wish Westy 12 came in a 750ml, so tasty and easy to drink, it's gone before you know it. Don't pass up an oppertunity to try Westvleteren 12 atleast once in your lifetime! 844 charactersShadesOfGray, Nov 22, 2009
4.79/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this last night after having it sit in the cellar for quite a while now. Received it in a trade a few months ago and the best after date (to which I have been informed was three after it was bottled) had passed over a year ago, so I'm thinking this bottle was an '05.
Poured into a chalice and away we go.
Appearance: Dark orange-amber with huge amounts of sediment and floating yeasties and goodness. Nice head and lacing, but the yeastiness was the biggest surprise.
Smell: Holy cow, this is where the beer really picks up. Big notes on just so many different levels, the complexity is fantastic. Pour was still a little on the cool side, but as it warmed it smelled as fantastic as any beer I've ever smelled. Grapefruit, fig, anise, molasses, slight leather, caramel, and grape-raisin. Booze is a little present as well, but nothing too off-putting. Just excellent and complex, everything I had hoped for and more.
Taste: Wow, just keeps on coming. Fantastic dark fruits and licorice, with a slightly peppery alcohol that only really adds another dimension to the beer, in no way boozy. I can see where this beer probably was a bit sweeter a few years back, but it mellows beautifully. Part of the reason this beer is so loved I would have to feel is you can just tell it ages like a charm. Three tiers of taste, starting fruity, going more peppery, and finishing with a malty creaminess that is just awesome. Bravo.
Mouthfeel: Very nice, not too bitter in any way, and alcohol is more of a flavor than a harshness. Carbonation is still great after all these years too, and just works well.
Drinkability: I kept pulling it back and was saddened when it was gone. I have to say, when I had Bernardus 12 on tap a few times on tap, I really loved it, and this beer was everything it was and just a hint more. I don't know if I had them both aged to the same point what they would look like in comparison, but both are worthy and amazing beers. Worth its' post in the pantheon of great beers, this is for certain, and like everyone always says, I just wish I could grab this more regularly for a special occasion. 2,123 charactersnomomentwasted, Nov 21, 2009

Massively complex flavor. Brown sugar, fig, and plum sweetness. Alcohol is well hidden, but catches up with you in the end. Very creamy mouth feel; this beer completely coats your mouth and stays sticky throughout. 356 charactersmuttyd, Nov 16, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Aroma - Dark fruit and a unmistakable Belgian quality. Also a nice amount of spice.
Appearance - Lots of tan head that slowly dissipated without leaving much lace. Red amber color.
Taste - Fruity and complex with alcohol heat to remind you of 10% ABV. Tons of fruit complexity hangs around in the flavor. A little too much alcohol warming than I would have liked at first. Really just a lot of fruitiness and alcohol. However even as it warmed it never got worse. Just an awesome amount of flavor.
Notes - This beer grew on me. My first impression wasn't wow but this beer's complexity takes time to appreciate. I still have five more so hopefully a little age will lower the amount of heat. 694 charactersjwhawkins81, Nov 13, 2009

4.57/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5100th Review! Acquired this beer at Gollem in Amsterdam. My profile pic is actually of me enjoying my first Westy at Gollem.
A - Stiff, tan head. Dark red to leathery brown in color. Looks very appetizing!
S - A plethora of delicious aromas. Very sweet vinous properties, brandy character, dark fruits and candied sugar.
T - Very wine-like. High ABV comes through as hot. Some bourbon qualities. Such a complex beer it is hard to pinpoint any one flavor.
M/D - One of the creamiest, smoothest beers I have had. I think the mouthfeel may actually be my favorite part of this beer. Not the 'best beer on planet earth,' in my opinion, but absolutely worth tracking down. 671 charactersSirSketch, Nov 01, 2009

Complex malty, vinuous, nutty flavor with hints of dates, raisins and dark cherries. Amazing complexity grows with each year of storage. I've tasted brews aged up to 8 years, with amazing results. Also tasted in a Westvletern-flavoured ice cream, believe it or not, at the monastery tap. In a class of its own. 382 charactersTravlr, Oct 31, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5Got this at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam. 
From a bottle into a chalice. 
Note: Part of the Quad Showdown, including Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12, and Westvleteren 12, in that order.
Note II: Bottle says best before 2011, which means this bottle is about a year old. 
APPEARANCE: Pours a two finger, medium looking tan head that quickly fades to a thin film leaving some clingy lacing down the sides. Colour is sepia or raw umber brown, slightly clearer than average, with medium levels of carbonation evident. A bit of a film remains until the end and leaves some lacing down the glass. Pretty quad for sure. 
SMELL: A very nice, but mild nose. Carmel malt up front with toffee and lost of dark fruits as well. Raisins and plumbs are prominent, as well as some nice spicy elements, such as cloves and coriander. Needs to be a little bolder bring it over the hump. 
TASTE: Ok, this part really is exceptional. Caramel malt, toffee, with lots of dark fruits again. Like the nose, raisins, plumbs and grapes come out well. Some spicy qualities, cloves for sure, and some spicy alcohol at the end. A nice dose of Belgian yeast provides the foundation for it all. The aftertaste is sweet and spicy with hints of alcohol, and is mild and long lasting. Much more complex and interesting than the nose had indicated. Very nice job here. One of the best in the category. 
PALATE: Medium-thin body with higher end carbonation, means you get quite a bit of air on the swallow. Creamy on the palate, goes down smooth with no bite at all, which is surprising for the ABV. Finishes slightly sticky on the palate. Decent, but a bit too thin and airy for my tastes. 
OVERALL: A very tasty quad, no doubt, but the look wasn't all that spectacular and the feel definitely held it back some. A little too thin and airy, a thicker more robust palate would bring it over the hump and set it apart from the masses for sure. Unlike their dubbel, which is world-class to say the least, and despite the superb taste profile, this one doesn't quite live up to the hype. In the Quad Showdown, it's a toss-up between this and the St. Bernardus, while both are well behind the superior Rochefort 10. 2,179 charactersJeffo, Oct 30, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I got three bottles at De Bierkoning, a great beer store in Amsterdam. I drank the first one while sitting along a canal outside of the apartment that my wife and I rented for our short stay. Great environment to say the least.
Poured into a La Trappe glass that I purchased at the same store.
A. Poured a beautiful dark auburn with a small tan like head.
S. The aroma may have been the best part. The smell reminded me of raisins and over ripe plums. I also got a hint of alcohol along with some yeast in the nose.
T. The taste was a composite of dried and undried fruit (raisins, cherries, plums, and prunes) and molasses. I also thought that it had a good amount of carbonation. At the end I felt some warming alcohol flavors.
F. More carbonation than I am used to for this style of beer. I liked that.
D. Almost scarry how drinkable this beer is. At over 10% abv this beer could do damage fast.
I drank all three of my bottles on my trip so I doubt that I will have another anytime in the near future. So I must ask the question; is this the best beer in the world? It was great. But I think that I like Rochefort 10 a little better. 1,144 characterscaliforniakulak, Oct 22, 2009
4.53/5  rDev -1.7%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: pours a maroon brown with copper highlights at the edges. A bit cloudy, some small sediment particles even with an extremely careful pour. Thin slightly off-white head, only a few millimeters, which goes down a bit a first but then lingers for quite a while. 
S: Initially bready/yeasty smell is most apparent. Light phenols. A hint of alcohol, but not boozy smelling at all. Very subtle hints of fruit, possibly bruised apple? Full rounded malt character and just a hint of grape as it warms up a bit more.
T: Not the typical heavy dark fruit of most quads. Instead an initial rich bready flavor. Rich caramel follows as it warms up a little bit, then transitions to almost a tart flavor. A little bit of spicy bitterness on the (long) finish. Malt notes also last long into this extended finish.
M. Extremely full but not heavy or coating. Carbonation level is nice to balance. Some warming alcohol on the finish but very subdued, not at all harsh. 
D: For its strength, quite good. The alcohol content is very very subtle. I would almost prefer that it be a bit more apparent, in fact. The aroma is lovely, but I wouldn't mind a bit more warming in the mouth. 1,169 charactersmmager, Oct 17, 2009
4.39/5  rDev -4.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally decided to open this bad boy up on a day in which I was brewing with my good friend Mike. Poured and shared from a 12 oz. bottle (or close to it) in a Bruery tulip glass.
A: This brew exhibited an overall dark brown hue with lit edges piercing around all sides of the glassware. The head was decent in the beginning, but didn't avail towards the end. The same thing can be said about the lacing as well. 
S: Licorice, dark fig, raisin, green apple, both light and dark grapes, tree bark, booze, and brown sugar. A multifaceted beer aroma to say the least and probably the most complex for any Quad I've run into yet. 
T: Light brown sugar or dark fruit sweetness, caramel, candied sugar, wood, and raisin are most of the flavors that my palate could distinguish and pick up. Again, there's a lot going on in both the smell and taste and feel like I'm missing out on tons of minute flavors. The only criticism I have is the over-the- top harsh finish. 
M: Mild carbonation, slightly drying, and the sugary malts seem to cling to mouth long enough bring out some sort weird sweet bitterness. 
D: A perfect fall/winter brew that is somewhat easy to drink and full of complex flavors; extremely impressed. I'm not sure if I could have more than a bottle, but again...wouldn't complain if someone shoved another glass of this right in front of me. 
Overall: #1 in the world? In my opinion...no, but I can definitely see why this beer is enjoyed by so many people. I've had the pleasure of drinking this mighty fine brew and hope one day I can enjoy it again. Cheers! 1,575 charactersOlieIPA, Oct 16, 2009

I can tell you that the reviews as given before tell (mostly) the truth. What a beer! In spite of a cold i had which makes it difficult it felt like coming home when i had the fist sip. 
The first taste i had was a bit of a sweet taste.
Tonight, the 30th of april 2011 i drank a westy again. Although i am buying a lot of crates of the 12 i rarely drink a westy 12 myself. Tonight i drank a fresh one but what a taste this one had!

A: The beer is a dark brown color, with a large off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is of brown sugar, caramelized malts, Belgian yeast some fruit and a faint touch of hops.
T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors brown sugar, caramel and dark fruit. There's a hearty malt character and Belgian yeast backbone that come in to provide a good deal of substance. The hops presence is very mild but is enough to provide a good balance. The after-taste is sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky but clean for the style.
D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, deceptively strong kick, very good representation of style, as it is ranked #1 on BA at the time of this review and has been for some time, I was expecting something a bit more demonstrative from this beer, but the only things that stood out in this beer above other were its sweetness and its smoothness. While I don't consider it the absolute best beer on Earth, it is indeed very good. 1,210 charactersTheManiacalOne, Oct 15, 2009
4.53/5  rDev -1.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Saved this brew for when my fiancee found out if/where she would be working during her second summer of law school / after graduation. Today was the day. Woo hoo!
A: Dark, reddish-brown body. Lighter along the edges. Large, frothy egg-shell head. Good retention. Dense coating of lacing.
S: Raisin, caramel, brown sugar, grape skins, figs. Complex and pungent, yet remarkably subtle.
T: Much like the nose, there are lots of subtle undercurrents of various dark fruits. Figs, raisins and cherries are prominent. Somewhat less sugar and caramel than is represented in the nose. The grape skin quality has trickled off and been replaced with a more boozier flavor. As the beer warms the flavors really pop out.
M: Somewhat thinner than expected for a quad. Perhaps its the booze thinning it out? Regardless, there is a nice lively carbonation up front and a good, clean finish.
D: Incredible. I tried to savor this guy, but I couldn't put the glass down for long. All in all, it lived up to the hype. If the body was a bit more substantial, this would have been even better.
Now, the question is: when do I drink my two remaining bottles??? 1,144 characterscallmemickey, Oct 15, 2009
4.27/5  rDev -7.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Side-by-side tasting with Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus Abt 12, and Westvleteren 12. Thanks jerz for sharing the Westy.
Pours a ruddy brown, somewhat reddish. Comparatively tiny head to other quads, but what does remain has fine bubbles with good retention and lace. 
Smells of wine, with the alcohol well integrated into it. Fructose, raisin, brown sugar, and earth round out the bouquet. Tastes of wine and cloyingly sweet candi sugar with lots of floral notes and some earth. Full bodied with a light, smooth carbonation. 
A large feat this beer accomplishes is integrating the alcohol so well into the fruit that it resembles wine in many ways. Is this why this beer is so world-renowned? Because it so tastes like wine? Additionally, the intense sweetness leaves me wondering as well. Other quadrupels or sweetened lambics leave beer geeks complaining over the sugar content, but still they are not as sweet as this beer. It is all quite perplexing. A very good beer this is, yes, but drinking it sheds a lot of light on the biases of the beer world. This beer took third place in my three-way side-by-side. 1,113 charactersvacax, Oct 15, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -5.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured dark brown with almost tan-cream head. Loads of lacing 
Beauriful nose, belgian yeast, caramel, toaasted nuts, and a huge plum presence.
The palate is less refined, huge hit of alcohol, with a bit more of the belgiany flaovr from teh yeast. More plum, lots of sugar fruit like rum soaked raisens, plums, some breadiness as well.
This is a great beer, worldclass no doubt, but best on the planet, i think thats a stretch. The nose is amazing, as good as any i have smelled to this point However, the pallete is a bit less complex than suggested by the nose. Don't get me wrong, this beer is better than most, its mindblowingly good. I jsut find the alcohol to be a bit much, and the flavor profile to be a hair off. All in all a truely great beer though. 760 charactersredneckchugger, Oct 11, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5What else is there to say about this beer. I didn't want to be one of those people that tried this beer and called it my favorite beer because its on the top of the list. But its nearly impossible. 
The first time I tried the beer in was at my apartment and some people i knew bought it over spring break when they went to Belgium. It was my first experience with a beer that was this complex. The next time I tried it I was in Belgium and i had more time to develop my beer pallet. 
The beer is bottle conditioned and can therefore be stored in a dark cool place to age the beer. I haven't tried it aged because I cant wait to drink it every time I have had it. 
The beer was poured into a goblet shaped class. Dark and cloudy, not as dark as I was expecting, but a brownish color. The smell is overwhelming. It smells of malts, caramel, sugar, very sweet smelling and yet still a very subtle and pleasant hop smell. The beer poured with about an inch of head that lasted until the beer was gone. The head itself was not as thick as a stout, but nor is it as light as a lager. The color of the head is a light brown. 
Even though the beer is 10.2% alcohol there is virtually no alcohol taste to the beer and a very smooth finish to it. The taste of the beer is mostly contributed by the Belgium yeast, but it is far more complex than that. It contains subtle hints of dark fruits, dark malt, yeast spice, caramel, and molasses. But no one ingredient hides any other, they are all represented in the correct amount.
It takes a while to drink this beer, but it is best to savor it. Each taste should be a mouthful that you spend at least five seconds before you swallow it to fully experience all this beer has to offer. If you have the chance to try it I fully recommend it. 1,779 charactersjamescain, Oct 08, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So.... I have read all the hype about this beer and I must say that for the most part.. the hype is true.. To start off with, I'm an IPA drinker so when all things are said and done I prefer a very good IPA such as 3F, Weyerbacher Double Simcoe, or Bells HopSlam. With that being said, this is probably the best Belgium beer I have ever had.. I recently went to Belgium in Feb. of 2009 and let me say that it was somewhat of a challenge to find it. I had lots of angry retailers tell me that it is illegal to buy it and would ask me to leave.. I had finally located some and brought some home with me in the US. While in Belgium, I had located a bar in Brugges that had some and I was impressed, but not particularly taken away (I'm skeptical if this was indeed a true westy... at the same time it may have not been as aged 
since then I had been really into Chimay, Rochfort 10, and St. bernardus.... So... it has been about 8 months since Belgium and I had bottles of Westy 12 waiting for a special occasion and aging and I don't know how old the bottle was to begin with. the cap said a date of 2011 so I'm not sure if that is when it expires or the best time to drink it..I brought a house and I figured that it was time to open one of my Westy's so here are my notes of last week's tasting
Smell...Brown sugar raisin malts.. Mellow and sweet smelling.. at some point I could have sworn I smelled a very faint hint of cinnamon, but intertwine with brown sugar
Appearance: dark brown... had a nice head which allowed the aroma to seep in my nose
Taste: Are you serious... this beer is 10.2% alcohol!! Very sweet, but not overbearing.. slight mild hops... only word that I can say is complex....
before I enjoyed the beer completely I actually did a taste test with all my favorite Belgiums (Chimay, Rochfort 10, St. Bernardus)... West 12 won.... hands down..the closest to complexity was Rochfort although they are two different beers and do not resemble one another at all.. the other beers seemed watered down and somewhat bland compared to Westy... don;t get me wrong.. they are great beers, but it doesn't compared.. Many people say that St. bernrdus is closest... I think it is to an extent, but it tasted very watered down in flavor...
 Nevertheless. I will still prefer drinking a great IPA on a regular basis.. on occasions I drink Belgium's... But if I had Wests 12 all the time, I may possibly drink them all the time... unfortunately they are hard to find.. I have two left... One for when I get married and the other when I become a father... 2,563 charactersmvice001, Oct 08, 2009
3.2/5  rDev -30.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2 |  overall: 3Poured into my Chimay goblet. It literally changed color in front of my eyes! Left the yeast floating in the bottom of the bottle. Golden brown (started off a lot lighter), no head, no lacing. Seemed flat and uncarbonated. 
Aroma of cinammon, brown sugar, pungent hop aroma, caramel. 
Very sweet caramel and brown sugar flavor. Alcohol well hidden. Couldn't help but notice it had a flat cola type of taste; I honestly wasn't impressed. 
Medium bodied but lacking carbonation. Flavor does remain on the palate, along with a slight hop bitterness. 
Decent drinkability, but I would find it infinitely more interesting if it were carbonated. I have one more bottle in my fridge and I really hope it's carbonated; if it is and it tastes a helluva lot better then I'll repost an edit on my review. 797 charactersdavexisxrabid, Oct 07, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - This beer poured a murky reddish brown color that produced a great fluffy off white head that had good retention and lace the side of the glass nicely
S - The aromas produced by this by this beer had a mix of malts, cherries, plums, nutty, of course that Belgian yeast is very strong, but a bit of heat is on the back end
T - The taste of this beer is very complex, but each and every aspect of the beer presents itself nicely, caramel malts, brown sugar, molasses, cherries, dried plums and raisins, and of course the Belgian yeast
M - The mouthfeel of this beer had a medium to heavy body, with a light to moderate amount of carbonation, this beer is very warming
D - This is the kind of beer that I would imagine a St. Bernard would carry to a frozen hiker, seriously, I was sweating after drinking this beer, but in all seriousness, good beer, everything that I imagined, not my favorite, but definitely in my top 10 928 characterscvfish, Oct 05, 2009

After a bit of hesitation, I finally pop the cap. Pours a pure brown infused with a panoply of bubbles. A slight covering of tan head dissipates quickly, leaving a few dots of lace strewn about. The aroma is vinous with ripe grapes, grape juice, grain, beer bread and some candy sweetness underneath it all. As it warms the complexity grows, with notes of vinegar and phenols eventually opening up. Tastes bready, malty and fruity up front. The alcohol heat goes straight to the stomach and curls up into a warm fuzzy little ball. Subsequent drinks reveal some sweet chocolates and caramel as well as spice and grain. The medium to full-body goes down creamy, and I'm looking at the half-empty bottle, already wishing I had more of this goodness. 792 charactersstephens101, Oct 02, 2009

A: Poured into a Mikasa chalice. Pours a large mocha head atop a very dark brown body. Plenty of yeast. The lacing is extremely long-lasting.
S: Lots going on here, especially as it warms up. The trademark yeast is by far the most prominent smell, accompanied by some dark malts and fruits, along with a bit of alcohol.
T: Much the same as the nose, and probably the most complex beer I've ever tasted. Plenty of dark fruits, dark malt, alcohol, fruit and yeast spice, caramel, and molasses. 
M: Very full and heavy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Luscious.
D: Quite complex and takes a while to drink, and only gets better as it warms up. Very nice to savor for a long period of time while continuing to find new things going on. 935 charactersThorpe429, Sep 24, 2009
4.55/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a flute. Amber in appearance with foamy bubbles presenting the off white head. Active carbonation apparent with some sediment.
Strong aroma of bready malts, apparant booze. Fragrant and inviting. 
Tastes of sweet malts. Very complex malt body. Tart and puckering. Herbal hop adds to the mix. Perfectly balanced. Pronounced dark fruit character. This beer is strong flavored and full bodied, reminiscent of a fine bourbon, only much cleaner on the palate.
Goes down really damn smooth. Crisp and well carbonated mouthfeel that makes me yearn to continue sipping.
Glad I got to try such a fine beer. Sets a benchmark of what a Quad should be. Drink em if you got em. 700 charactersStinkypuss, Sep 21, 2009
4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Smokestack Goblet. Extremely cloudy with a reddish brown hue and just a ring of head around the glass. truly a perfect looking quad.
Smell is probably the most complex I've ever smelled. But I can say I wish the volume was kicked up a notch. because it's very hard to pull the distant ones out of the background. Candied sugar and a Vanilla/banana/burnt currants and some exceptional figgy undertones. WOW
I thought that because of the hype I wouldn't be blown away....I am. Tastes like it smells with a overly complex flavor. A tingling alcohol twinge scurries it's way down your throat and almost sends chills up your spine. Jesus...
Mouth is overcarbonated at first but flattens out quickly. Slightly dry like it has been wood aged but I'm sure it hasn't. I can't even describe this one past a point. I could enjoy a bottle but I wouldn't dare waste another on a ruined palate. 897 charactersnaterock, Sep 20, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from the bottle into a Goblet
A-Deep caramel brown, very light head that lingers around the edges. Very dark brown yeast floats all over, not sinking to the bottom just stays suspended in the glass.
S-So incredibly much going on here its crazy notes of bannanna, sweet fig, maple syrup, white grape, spicy hops. Also a woody note to go with the slight alcohol undertone.
T-Bitter malt and yeast with a very earthy wine flavor in the middle. On the very tip of your tongue it is incredibly sweet while on the sides and back it comes across incredibly bitter and boozy. The complex nature of the hops, yeast and malt all blend like nothing I've ever tasted before, and the alchol flavors that it finishes with give it a nice burn in the back of your throat. As rich and complex as the beer is the most amazing thing is the way it just goes away off your palate but leaves a very flavorful burn in the back of your throat.
M-Rich and oily, but not bad oily a very sliky smooth feel. Carbonation even on the 3 year vintage is near perfect. Feels very much like a wine in your mouth.
D-This is an amazing beer but I would never want it all the time. What I would like to do is get hold of a few of them or even be lucky enough to try one fresh. 1,251 charactersSpecialK088, Sep 20, 2009
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The most popular beer in the world, the Westvleteren 12. I had it already many times, fresh and vintage, but never reviewed one until now. Because I think the fresh Westvleteren 12 is nice, but quite overhyped because of its rarity, I review a vintage from 1999. 
Poured into a Westvleteren chalice. The beer pours a clear caramel brown color, with a small head (normal for a vintage) that disappeared fast into a thin lacing. 
Smell: Sweet, spicy, very malty, honey, caramel and hints of alcohol. 
Taste: overall sweet-bitter. Maple syrup, toffee, caramel, clear honey, some hints of dark fruits (although not as strong as the WV8 vintage) and nicely spiced hops (much more spicy than WV8 vintage). Reminds me a bit of Madera wine. 
Mouthfeel: still surprisingly much carbonation for a 10 year old beer. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. Medium-bodied
Overall: This is absolutely the best beer in the world. Fresh good, vintage simple the best. I can drink this one whole year. Perfect balance between sweet, bitterness and spices. It is so soft, smooth, creanessmy and full of taste, this must be the real angels share! All other beers in the world, eat your heart out!!! 1,176 charactersrvdoorn, Sep 18, 2009
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5oh man, I'm reviewing The Beer. .33l bottle into westvleteren chalice. date on cap is 21.04.12
A - dark opaque brown body, medium tan head, dark brown yeast on top of the head, which is big and made from medium sized bubbles. top of the head is creamy and smooth, with some big crackly bobbles int he middle. tons of lacing. head slowly, slowly comes down; retention is great. let me emphasize how much lace there is on this beer once more. top notch. the colour is perfect, and the head makes it look so incredibly appetizing. the color of the beer and the head compliment the dark green logo quite well. maybe its just the experience but I have never seen such a hot piece of beer ass.
S - has to warm up a bit, but the initial right-out-of-fridge notes are almost clean, except for a light fruitiness of golden raisins. as the brew warms up the notes do not really change that much, except a roasted and slightly nutty malt character comes into play. I am pretty disappointed with the strength of this beer so far; but as I wait the beer gets even more complex: here is the quad I was expecting! slightly spicy phenols, alcohol, and Belgian yeast all come out now. some fresher notes are to be had as well, like lemon grass. that alcohol is quite amazing, really blend well with the spicy aspect. the nose never does get too strong, but the dynamism of how the beer changes over temperature difference is amazing, and gets it the big five (this beer tastes to excellent, anyways, to not be perfect). moreover, the fact that this beer isnt as strong in the nose doesn't actually detract from the excellence of the beer, the nose doesn't need to be powerful to get across the message of this brew.
T - yep, this gets a five. this is so complex and delicious, i just don't even know where to start. the initial notes are like a unsweetened sparkling apple cider, some aggressive alcohol, hops and malts. the hops are bitter an noticeable, while the malts are rich and almost nutty, a bit of mustiness from the yeast. these malts are really masterfully combined with hop bitterness, they create this perfect balance which is then trampled over by the alcohol, which brings another aspect from the hops: this dry like astringent-ness, an even sharper bitterness. this is so complex that I cant get enough of it. the amazing thing is how the beer goes from a semi-mild flavour as it just enters the mouth, malt-hop blend dominating, to something so bold and powerful. the nuttiness from the malts is most prevalent when the beer wafts through the nose via the back of the throat. the finish is hoppy, followed by a slightly sweet malt character, maybe a hint of that Belgian candied sugar? probably not, i bet the yeast has taken care of all of the sugar in this brew. the hops are coupled with a yeast character that adds a sense of stagnation and mustiness, making the brew really feel rustic and unfiltered. the aftertaste is this bittersweet malt-hop brawl. the hops have reverted to their standard bitter character, which can be described an herbal oil kind of bitterness. phenomenal. this beer is not all hype; it is the be all and end all for Belgian beers and the quad style. the taste is so varied and has so many discernible layers that it completely deserves the full score
MF&D - perfect and utterly drinkable. the body is fully that of a medium beer, which is perfect to compliment the capriciousness of the beers intricate flavours; anything heavier might be a detriment and make the beer way too overwhelming, especially when considering the alcohol content, which is not a detriment on the experience at all, rather, it compliments the aggressive hops and rustic malts. The beer is so incredibly good that no matter how much alcohol was in it, I would gladly keep drinking this; the booze is no detriment in any way (maybe that's just my tolerance, but who cares! this beer rocks!)
the only complaint I could have is that the nose is not strong enough. but i find this to be completely irrelevant when considering how synergistic the whole beer is together. keeping this brew from receiving a perfect score, in that respect, would not be right. this is the beer, and will be so in my view until I try something that is even better for its own style. 4,267 characterserz316, Sep 17, 2009

after wanting this beer for nearly 5 years i'm finely able to drink it! huzah!!
pours a deep redish brown with very little head and showing a small amount of carbonation.
smell is definitely very hot for my liking and i was slightly worried that this was going to be ultra boozey, but that's not the case at all. the booziness gives way to marciano cherries and molasses.
complex. first sips taste of melted dark chocolates and buttery smooth malts. as you get further in a slight zestiness at first gives way to cherries, plum, and a sweet candied taste at points. other dark fruits seem to pop up every now and then.
very smooth in the mouth, not very much carbonation, but it just adds to how smooth and truly drinkable this beer is.
drinkable? absolutely! 825 charactersradshoesbro, Sep 15, 2009

Pours a beautiful brown/mahogany, thick head, lots of lacing, nice retention. The smell is a bit subtle--not as big as I expected. Almost like wine. Also some clove, lots of dark fruit, a bit of booze and yeast, and maybe even some banana? Great, but really not what I was expecting. The taste is just incredible--more dark fruit and wine, grapes, brown sugar, raisins--very faint alcohol. As I continue I'm getting lots of bread, a really surprising, balanced bitterness... With every sip it keeps getting more and more complex. Probably one of the most complex beers I've ever tasted, I'm getting hits of things I've never gotten from beer. Incredibly unique. Mouthfeel is smooth, thick, creamy. Drinkability is amazing for the ABV.
I was expecting a lot, and it delivered. 894 charactersPlaywrightSam, Sep 14, 2009

Poured from 330mL bottle into a tulip.
Appearance: beautiful slightly opaque mahogany with a nice very light tan head. Gorgeous!
Smell: very subtle; floral with a bit of a spicy yeast character.
Taste: frankly, the aroma did not meet my preconcieved notions of how good this beer is supposed to be; however, the flavor blows them away. The malt is well-rounded and flavors migrate from light berry to tree fruit to a delicious, almost floral je ne sais quoi. Is it too late to become a monk?
Mouthfeel: body is the heavy side of medium, the impression is one of a very light syrup without being at all cloying or over-thick. There is not a lot of carbonation, but I don't think it matters.
Drinkability: the only thing impeding the drinkability is availability. More please. 899 charactersflagmantho, Sep 12, 2009

Smells of rich dark fruit, candi sugar, cereal, a light grassiness, yeasty, a hint of alcohol, somewhat vinous, amazingly complex. Flavor profile is so deep, I'm not even sure I know how to describe it. Getting some candied figs, lightly chocolaty, chewy malts, buttery on the finish.

I shared the bottle with two great friends of mine who went to meet the Belgians with me. We're finally settled into our house: just about everything is perfect and we're ready for an amazing year. I couldn't possibly think of a better way to start it: my escapades this weekend coupled with the drinking of a Westy 12 today? Divine. And yes, today was the end of the weekend. 
Thanks so much to Filip and the rest of the Belgian Beer Board for this bottle. 
Drank relatively warm: put it in the fridge for about 35 minutes to lightly chill it before drinking.
The sound of the cap popping off was so awesome. There's no other way to describe it. The moment it came off some huge dark fruit notes assaulted our nostrils in the best kind of way. My initial pour yielded a very generous head that threatened to spill out of my chimay glass. I waited a moment and then ever so slowly poured the rest of the bottle. My hands shook. So. Much. to live up to here. Poured a beautiful deep, dark mahogany to rival the coffee table we rested the bottle on. The head was a billowing tan-white thing that eventually settled to about an 1/8 inch cap over the beer. Lacing was spot on.
The only component of this beer that didn't blow my mind was the smell. From the bottle a heavenly aroma wafted towards our nostrils but once poured it was far more subdued and I had a hard time reconciling my initial perception with the one to follow. The smell of dark fruits: figs, plums, raisins were present. Additionally, some roasted nuts and Belgian yeast. One thing I didn't pick up on was any alcohol notes. 
I couldn't dream up a more complex tasting beer. I only wish I had more Belgian Quads under my belt- the only ones of truly spent some time with are the Rochefort and St. Bernadus. Nonetheless, I detected a lot going on- big dark fruit notes...it's so hard to pick apart this flavor profile. That balance is beyond beautiful. It's perfect. Molasses, dates, caramel malt. Better than exceptional. 
What I really noticed first and foremost with this beer was this: the mouthfeel was the most incredible of any beer I'd ever tasted. Drinkability, too, was absolutely off the charts. It's full bodied with a light dryness and perfectly rounded smoothness.
Here's to hundreds and hundreds more beers! 
I need more. Please send. 2,436 charactersoriginalsin, Sep 10, 2009

I'm hoping that this will be a fitting brew for my 200th review here on BA. I'm guessing that it will...
Date on Cap: 23.04.11
Served in a chalice @ approx 50&#730; F
A- The cap pops off with a gentle hiss. I poured this ever so slowly into my favorite chalice. Pours a deep murky burgundy color with tiny little floaties hovering around. A thin but rocky crème colored head leaves some scattered lacing behind. Lots of carbonation bubbles stream up the sides of the glass as I sip. 
S- As soon as I opened it I was hit with waves of dark fruits and Belgian yeast. The alcohol is quite noticeable in the nose but it doesn't take away or detract from more subtle aromas of sweet roasted malt, figs, and chestnuts. 
T- I imagine that trying to name all of the different contributions to the flavor profile would be futile to say the least, but I'll give it a shot anyway. Sharp initial sting of alcohol that is quickly whisked away by massive amounts of dark fruit flavors including plums, raisins, white grapes, and figs. A sweet caramel malt takes over and brings in flavors of anise, licorice, toasted nuts, oak, and honey. A slight characteristically funky Belgian yeast flavor in the finish that helps to round out the overall taste. To say this beer is balanced almost seems like an insult. I think that 'harmony' is a better word than 'balanced' in this situation.
M- Big and smooth with a tannin like dryness that leaves you wanting another sip. The high level of carbonation helps disperse all of the intricate flavors across the tongue. The aftertaste lingers of sweet grapes and the alcohol creates a gentle warming effect.
D- I must admit, I had pretty lofty expectations for this brew, but I can easily say that this is one of the best beers that I have ever had. By far one of the most complex and drinkable beers around. 1,948 charactersprojectflam86, Sep 04, 2009
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Cracked this in celebration of my third anniversary. Currently listening to Dr. Dre's Chronic Re-lit "B***hes Aint S**t."
Guess I'm one of those people that likes Westy 8 more, as my score isn't as high for the 12. Pours a swampwater brown but plenty of tan head salvages the appearance. Smell is sweet, malty, dark fruit, stone fruit, grapes, yeast, and bread. Tastes similar, but add brown sugar to the mix. I don't find this as complex and layered as the Westy 8. Maybe that means my palate isn't as complex, but it is what it is. Body is medium with medium to high carbonation. Highly drinkable. Could drink 3 no problem. But I disagree with the characterization of this beer as best in the world. It's great but easily eclipsed by several brews.

A: Pours a light brown color which is very cloudy. Many particles can be noticed floating around. Forms a medium, creamy and medium bubbled beige head. Good retention and only few thin molasses lacings left in the glass. A thin layer remains forever on the top
S: Very sweet and fruity upfront. Strong notes of dark fruits like, plums and grapes. Raisins. Strong notes of brown bread, caramel malts and roasted malts. Candy sugar, brown sugar, Belgian yeasts and some alcohol
T: As suggested by the nose. Sweet and fruity upfront. Strong notes of dark fruits (grapes and plums) and dry dark fruits (dates ans raisins), brown bread, caramel malts, candy sugar, Belgian yeasts and earthy hops. A bit of bubblegum sensation. Nice light bitter end. Hops are bit grassy and bit citrus. Great bittersweet balance
M: Heavy, creamy and molasses body. Medium to low carbonation. Fruity and mainly bready aftertaste. Bittersweet
O: Deliciously drinkable despite of the high ABV. Perfect Belgian Trappist. Perfect Belgian Quad. Not as good as Rochefort 10 but, this is another story... ;) 1,129 characterseduardolinhalis, Sep 03, 2009

Beer was brown, mostly clear until the mud at the bottom of the glass came out, this was avoidable, i know how to pour. The head was diffuse but present and the carbonation was slow but steady, continuously replenishing the thin head. The smell was amazing. Beautiful yeasty and sweet smell. The taste and mouthfeel were out of this world. It was smooth, I could have drank the whole thing in a few minutes but I savored it for as long as possible. Taste was sweet and pleasant. More yeast, no aftertaste. A perfect beer. I wish I could have ti year round. 658 charactersdrabmuh, Sep 02, 2009

Pours a rusty brown with a thin but dense white head, leaves lots of lacing. The color is not terribly appealing. The smell is of roasted nuts, hijiki seaweed, sweet grape, a rich caramel malt -- very complex. The flavor is sweet grapes (like cognac, almost), caramel, grain, with a lingering bitter earthy finish. It's creamy but clean in the mouth, not at all viscous, very nice. Really just too delectable for words. More. 505 charactersgory4d, Sep 02, 2009
4.69/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- A nice hazy/opaque chocolate brown. Medium white head with good lacing.
S- Grapes, cherries, cloves, a hint of alcohol. Smells delicious and balanced.
T- A barrage of roasted malt, cherries, grapes, some alcohol, big herbal hops. One of the best quads out there, no doubt, but I don't think the best beer in the world. Some bread malt in there too. The beauty of this one is in its balance.
M- Refreshingly creamy and smooth. Pretty much exactly what it should be.
D- I'm loving this, although I'm not sure it soundly beats out others like the Abt 12 and Rocheforte 10. Definitely a great drink, worth the try, although I probably won't get it again because of the price. 678 charactersLordAdmNelson, Sep 01, 2009
4.18/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Had the 3 bottles in order Blond, 12 then 8. Split the bottle 3 ways for a tasting.
A - Not sure if it was the weather but I didn't get a lot of lacing or head from this beer. What head it did have formed the larger bubbles that some Belgian yeasts help produce. This was very transparent for being so dark. I got some crazy floaties from the yeast sediment. No problem with me though.
S - I smelled the alcohol there but a lot of fruitiness was there as well.
T - The balance was great on this beer. Not as good as the 8, but still well done. I remember there being a ton of left over sugar taste. I'm still not sure how to get that raisin taste in my homebrew but I'm sure the yeast and fermentation temp plays a big role. The alcohol was present but not overwhelming for a 10% beer. 
M/D - Very good carbonation. I would have like to have this on tap at my home.
I think I built this up too much in my head. It is definitely not on the top of this hophead's list, but still an amazing beer that I would highly recomend. 1,028 charactersKCHopHead, Sep 01, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5First, lets admit it. How can you be absolutely honest when you have the chance to drink this beer? Only in a blindtasting session... This was not the case!
Poured ina Delirium Tremens sniffer, This gem pours mahogany brown with reddish tone, hazy. It forms a nice white to off-white head, 1cm thick. Unfortunately disappearing to quickly. Is this one's to cold?
Nose: Rich malt, medium roast. very faint smoke wood. Caramel. Fig. Alcohol nose is present and fruity but not dominative event though this one is 10.2% ABV. 
Mouth: Carbonation is medium-low. Taste... very complex. Extremely complex and evolves as its temperature changes. So as the nose. Bitter chocolate. Faint cherry flavours comes up after a few sip that's reminds me of Flemish red beer. Bitterness is present but really nicelly balanced. Alcohol note is fruity and delightful. It blends all the flavours together and brings warmth. It carries this beer very well. In the finish, sweet roasted sugar cane or brown sugar even and hint of oatmeal flavour.
Conclusion: Wow, truly one of its kind. Deserves an A+ easily. Perfectly balanced beer. Outstanding. 1,127 charactersblaje, Aug 29, 2009

A - Hazy brown color with a large tan head that lasts and leaves awesome lacing.
S - Heavenly aroma of dark fruits, sweet malt, caramel, spices, and Belgian yeast.
T - Really complex with sweet caramel malt, candi sugar, prune, fig, raisin, plum, and other dark fruits, Belgian yeast, spices, and a touch of hops. Phenomenal.
M - Incredibly full-bodied and velvety smooth on the palate with soft carbonation. Gives you an excellent warming sensation on the way down.
D - Ridiculously drinkable. It took quite a bit of restraint to not put down the Westy 12s I had at in de Vrede in two minutes. Every time you take a sip of this stuff, you instantly want another. 839 charactersnickd717, Aug 21, 2009

Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lot of tiny bubbles for carbonation. I really like the feel of this beer. Taste is very complex. There is candi sugar, dark fruit, some sweet malt, and a small amount of hop spice. Alcohol is hidden very well. The blend of malt, hops, mouthfeel, and finish makes this a supreme beer.

A: Haven't had many quads yet, but this one pours without any head at all. The color is cloudy dark brown with a reddish/yellow tint. Very slight, if any, lacing.
S: There's alot going on in this one. Smells of sweet raisins/grapes/wine. Sugar coated plums and fermented dark fruits also. Slightly earthy scents as well.
T: The taste is big. The raisiny/fruityness is very forward and is followed by sugar sweetness. I get sort of a caramel covered apple aftertaste, which is extremely delicious. There is somewhat of an alcohol presence, but not as much as expected.
M/D: This is a full bodied, thick beer. Would love to have a bottle to myself in the dead of winter, as this could definitely warm one up.
Just excellent. 905 charactersTheViolator666, Aug 17, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Here we go, Westy12....
Poured a deep amber, reddish brown color. The head is very faint, only a foamy ring around the outside of the glass at its maximum and quickly dissipated down. 
The smell is great, slightly vinous and very complex. Big malt presence in the aroma; caramel, earthy grainy notes, dark fruit or perhaps raisins and a hint of cider all compliment each other making this beers bouquet very rich and complex. 
The taste has a big malt sweetness up front. Raisins, dark fruit, caramel, cider and earthy notes come from big malt flavor up front. The alcohol is present but not too overpowering. Huge flavor with a big sweet chewy and syrupy mouth feel that is just right and not over done. The aftertaste is warm with a hint of hop bitterness that lingers on the palate balancing out the big malt presence up front.
I can definitely see why this is the reigning champ of beers!
Cheers! 905 charactersClevoPiwo, Aug 17, 2009
4.69/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4First Westvleteren 12, very excited to try this one.
Pours a dark reddish-brown, with very little head that dissipates to almost nothing. The smell is ripe fruits with a syrupy sugar glaze. With this comes some fruity esters from the high ABV. To be more precise, I would say the smell is almost vinous, fermented grapes.
The flavor is extremely sweet upfront, followed by fruits and maltiness. The finish is very warm with an alcohol mixed malt flavor. This beer is like liquid candy and warm alcohol. Tastes delicious.
The mouthfeel is smooth and warm. The consistency seems about perfect. Aside from the huge sweetness factor and the high ABV, this is a very drinkable beer. However, I don't think I would want more than two in a sitting.
So, I have finally had the highly renowned Westvleteren 12. Tonight I tried this beer along side the St. Bernardus 12, which was my favorite trappist beer up to this point. I've also had the Rochefort 10, but after drinking these two I think I need to try it again. Drinking the St. Berndardus and Westvleteren head to head has really helped define the differences in these beers. In terms of appearance, the St. Bernardus looks much more attractive to me. However, I found myself liking the overall flavor of the Westvleteren more, and since beer is mostly about flavor, I tip my hat to the Westy. It truly is an exceptional beer. 1,377 characterssisuspeed, Aug 16, 2009
4.57/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.521.04.12, poured into a snifter.
Color is a lighter mahogany in direct light and a deep red at the thickest part of the glass. Pours with little to no head. Very clear. Smells pretty crazy for a beer! More like a plum wine, white grape juice, mead, sherry or even Manischewitz. Very sweet, fairly alcoholic.
Tastes smooth, barely carbonated but slightly sharp. Again, very sweet with a medium body that starts with those same aromatic notes of white grape and evolves into a pleasant caramel malt before leaving a lingering hoppy bitterness. This reminds me very much more of a sherry with its flatness and the fruit notes, but without some of the mouthfeel. Alcohol fumes are quite effervescent here despite the low carbonation. There is a lot of cake at the bottom and it loosens a little as poured, so leaving the final inch or so in the bottle. Refilling the glass has produced a slightly cloudier pour that retains the same characteristics except with slightly more malt shining through as it warms a little and slightly more yeasty aftertaste... which makes sense.
Pretty good, I'd say! Not sure if this becomes my definitive quad, but for sure it's a very interesting one and appreciably complex. I wouldn't mind sipping away at it again. 1,248 charactersabuliarose, Aug 16, 2009

Pours a deep brown with amber hues. Almost no head to speak of. Good amount of sediment in the glass. Only some lacing.
Smells like angels tears. Very sweet, likely the malt coupled with the alcohol presence. Traces of prunes and raisins.
Tastes like...joy. Plain and simple joy. Brown sugar, lots of malt, alcohol, dark fruits, toffee, a hint of chocolate, and mildly spicy. Aftertaste provides a delicious malt aftertaste that lingers with you.
Perfectly carbonated mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable despite the ABV.
Well, I have had it. Nothing else to drink now. Overall, this is one beer that lives up to its hype. Coupling its quality with its rarity makes this beer a real treat. 806 charactersjdubjacket, Aug 13, 2009

The first taste was extremely sweet with a lot of malt presence. Thick taste sits on the tongue. After just a few sips and I can feel the alcohol in my face. 
Unbelievably drinkable for the alcohol content. Extremely hard to get unfortunately and althought it is easily one of my favorites of all time, but I think I just prefer my RIS's better. 564 charactersdegerbah, Aug 10, 2009

Poured into a stemmed tulip from a 12oz bottle. The appearance defines eye candy. A very hazy and viscous brown with no visibility through the body. Pours an initially foamy creamy light khaki head with streaks of what looks like cocoa powder. The head retains at a creamy, thin layer. Slight lacing rests about an inch above the body.
The smells is mind numbingly complex. Every time my nose takes a whiff, I smell something different. I want to break this down as far as I can so hear goes... Tons of toffee/bitter caramel scents, light belgian candied sugars, raisins, white grapes, brown sugar, light coriander, semi tart cherry, and some light cocoa scents. The smell isn't in your face, but it blends so well together.
The taste is exceptional in the same way that the scent is. Everything noted in the scent is visible in the taste in some form or another in addition to some figs, vanilla, and some plum and red grapes. This beer is so smooth, I don't know if this has come with age (2.5 years cellared) or what, but this is such a well crafted beer. 
Initially, the high carbonation is a little bit off-putting, but as it warms and dies down it becomes much more pleasing. I didn't really understand the darker complex belgians when I began my journey. Beers like this, Rochefort 8/10, and St Bernardus 12 really help in making sense of the magical and mythical works of the trappists! 1,502 charactersCoolJosh, Aug 08, 2009
3.72/5  rDev -19.3%look: 1.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3.5Chilled bottle into a glass. 
A: Pours a magnificent chestnut brown with moderate light penetration. Despite a vigorous pour, the only bubbles churned up are from agitation; retention is nonexistent, no donut, no lacing. Meh. 
S: My first thought was that this smells like a wine. Lots of ripe, pungent dark fruit (red grapes, dates, figs) with the slightest hint of a boozy warmth. Phenolic spice character, candied sugar, and some yeast in there as well. At times I get a cinnamon-infused banana bread character. Wow. 
T: It starts off with yeast, but progresses into a restrained sweetness consisting of bread, graham crackers, and dark fruits. I taste a lot of grape/raisin, and some lesser dates and figs. Spiciness is actually pretty mild, pricking the tongue just slightly here and there. Very light candi sugar is tasted throughout. Despite all this, the beer finishes, amazingly, a tad on the dry side. Impressive. Kind of expecting more spice though. 
M: I'll be honest, I expect lively carbonation in Belgians. This beer poured flat, and suffers a bit for it, but it makes it up with a fairly attenuated body that doesn't let the sweetness become too much. Despite smelling a touch of the booze, I never tasted it and never felt it while drinking -- although walking straight was a challenge afterward. 
D: It's a great beer, but in almost a dozen bottles of having this, I can't recall one that was above a wisp of carbonation. Maybe I have bad luck or maybe this beer just lacks in that department. I don't care for that. Given the difficulty of acquiring it, I give the nod to St. Bernardus 12 here. 1,618 charactersArbitrator, Aug 07, 2009

Smell: Dark fruit, figs and plums. Sweet candied sugar, sweet red grapes, strong honey, sweet allspice berries and cardamon spice. 
Taste: What I expect after the smell. Sweet grape and cherry, alcohol spice that remains throughout, plums and figs, allspice berry, honey, and sweet malty grain. 
Mouthfeel: Thick body, good carbonation, very sweet and syrupy, alcohol burn, leaves mouth a bit sticky but also somewhat clean. 
Overall: Good drinkability, a bit more alcohol spice than I would like, nice sweet fruity character. Very complex sweet flavors, but the spice could be more prevalent. Overall great beer! Worth trying despite the cost or troubles.

4.19/5  rDev -9.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5First bottle of Westy came out of nowhere. Kinda fell into my lap without so much as a fanfare or accrued quest to find it, so hopefully this cut down hype generating expetations. I didn't write notes, but wanted to put down a few thoughts to act as a placeholder for a more considered tasting. I'll drink this in Belgium next month, but here's a bottle drank in Canada...
Oaken pour with a very thin tan head that dissipated to a film. The retention and lacing isn't all that good, but it has a nice higher ABV, so I'll cut it some slack.
Aroma of raisins, chocolate, brown sugar and marzipan. Sweet, rich and enticing... while the appearance was a bit of a disappointment, the aroma is certainly all I would hope for. The taste is also excellent, though not quite the heavenly elixir I was led to believe. Again, strong dark fruit notes mingle with chocolate, sweet spice and burned sugar. The body is smooth, but could do with being a bit thicker to punch up the flavour and add some more luxury to it. Nonetheless this is a minor quibble.
An excellent beer, and the world number one, if not mine. I can see why people like it, but for me it doesn't stand out from the crowd. 1,181 charactersbobsy, Aug 05, 2009

Dark opaque brown with a frothy two finger head; some minor lacing down the glass. Smell was heavenly; dark fruits, malty with some spice, sweet. Taste was similar, very complex; sweet and dry at the same time, very rich fruit flavor; figs, raisins, dates? Amazing how long down the throat the flavors continue. As it warmed it was slightly easier to taste the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel was really good, with a high degree of carbonation to keep all corners of the pallette involved in the pleasure. Drinkability from a flavor standpoint is good, but this one sneeks up on you. A powerhouse of alcohol. 703 charactersBeTheBall, Aug 03, 2009

A- Beautiful dark brown color, thin to no head. Beautiful auburn.
S- Malty sweetness with a high alcohol smell.
T- Completely unique. Waves of flavor assault the palate. First yeast, then malts, then a short glimpse of booze with a finish and aftertaste of hops. Completely different from anything I've ever exprienced.
M- Substantial, yet comfortable. Not too thick to make it syrupy, but not too thin to make it insubstantial.
D- Superior to most flavorful beers, it's not too heavy to drink more than one or two of. I'd drink it all night if I had access to them.
This beer is not all hype. Well worth the money. 702 charactersfff, Aug 03, 2009

T. A terrific taste. A very nice blend of spices, with a slight bitterness in the back of the mouth. The beer keeps getting better and better with each drink you take.
M. Well carbonated, you get a different feeling on every part of your tongue while you are drinking it. The flavors stick to the back of your mouth well after you are done drinking.

Pours a silky beer red/brown mud hut color with an inch of medium bodied but long lasting tanish/beige head. Retains in the glass remarkably.
Smell has got sweet malts, grain, banana bread, and spice.
Taste has different flavors on each drink. I get spice and sweet malt through the first few drinks, then becomes spicy with some non-citrus fruit on the next few sips. They blend together greatly.
I stopped drinking this nearly 3 minutes ago and I've still got some Belgian spice and grain on my palate.
One of my friends said this, and I agree, this is a much better gulper than a sipper. You do the math... 630 charactersThaBobfather, Aug 01, 2009

TEMP: Cellared @ approx 45 degrees
DATE ON CAP: 19.03.11
Pours up a very dark, almost opaque, golden brown. Slightly more than a fingers worth of light tan colored foam makes the head. It recedes to a foamy film that sits on the surface throughout the rest of the glass. Lacing is in slightly thick ropes and is quite clingy.
Oh, man, it does smell wonderful. Like a huge basket full of dark fruits at varying degrees of ripeness. This creates an almost wine-like scent. Bold hints of candi sugars. Subtle malty presence. Cherries, grapes, figs and pomegranates....it smells almost candy-like. As it warms a touch of nice yeastiness comes out.
Wow, this alot drier than the nose foretold. It's not totally dry, to be honest. It has a nice level of sweetness on the tongue, but is really dry around the edges. Candi sugars and malts are fairly subdued, here. A bit of yeasty bread smothered in a dark fruit jam.
Maybe I need to try one that's been aged for awhile, but I'm not really ecstatic about this one. I expected a little more complexity and seperation of flavors. It's actually fairly subdued and the flavors are all blended together.
The body is on the lower end of the 'full' side of the spectrum. Carbonation is very well done. Silky smooth and a touch creamy. Very nice.
This is totally a highly drinkable brew, but, honestly, if I'm going to drink a Quad, which I often do, I'd probably reach for a different one than this, first. 1,462 characterscoldmeat23, Jul 28, 2009

Pours a nice brown with white head and smells of sweet malts. Carbonation is just right and allows for excellent drinability. Just has a crazy mild sweetnees that hides the high alcohol content - yes it tastes a little like grape soda at some points.

4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.53/20/2010 Review @ In De Vrede
A- Poured from the bottle into a Wesvleteren chalice with a good 1" of rocky khaki colored foam, and some lovely lacing observed along the glass. The body is a turbid garnet-tinged brown. No visible carbonation, but that may have something to do with the opacity. Looked gorgeous. (4.5)
S- Initial impressions are rich candy and roasted malts, some Belgian yeast aromatics, some candi sugar, as well as some faint stale hops. As the beer warms up, much more of those fruity esters- rich complex aromas of chocolate, cherry, dried dark fruit, and leather begin to emerge on the nose. (4.5)
T- This was a rollercoaster in the mouth. Initially, when served cool, the taste was comprised of extremely rich flavors of caramel and roasted malts, candi sugar, some stale hops and some fruity esters. The finish lingers wonderfully with esters. As the beer warmed, the malts were perceived as more bready, and the sweet fruity esters emerged as well (chocolate, cherry, dried fruit, and leather). The warmer beer peaked in the mouth with increased candi sugar, some faint hop bitterness and just a *touch* of booziness, which was non-offensive, simply warming and pleasant. More perceived caramel, chocolate and molasses emerged in the middle as well, and now the finish lingers with malt and just a touch of hop bitterness. Amazing how the beer continually evolved throughout the drink. (5.0)
M- A medium to full body. Not a ton of texture there. Some unattenuated sugar. The carbonation is not as soft as I would have liked, but it's not quite bloating. As the beer warmed, the carbonation began to soften and create for a creamier mouthfeel, which was just wonderful (4.5)
D- The alcohol is very well hidden throughout the drink. So smooth and creamy, the aromas and flavors are incredible. This is dangerously drinkable. (4.5)

A- Pours an opaque dark brown; medium head with some nice lacing. (4.5)
S- Raisins, figs, dates co-mingle with candy sugar and yeast in the nose. (4.5)
T- The dark fruit now seems to meld with some dark chocolate notes, and a slightly warming alcohol burn. Finishes slightly yeasty and metallic, but in a non-offensive way. Just a lot going on here. All good stuff. (4.5)
M- Creamy full body that coats the mouth, allows for extended enjoyment after each sip. (5)
D- Exceptionally drinkable given the ABV. Could have 3 or 4 of these in a sitting if I were so lucky. (4.5) 2,459 charactersjgasparine, Jul 20, 2009
2.96/5  rDev -35.8%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5Pours dark brown head. Lots going on in the aroma. Dark fruits, sherry, candy, quite a bit going on here. Flavor is very complex, fruit, funk, alcohol, caramel, chocolate. Finishes highly carbonated, but doesn't get in the way of the beer. I could still use less carbonation on this one. Light alcohol notes which melded well with the beer without taking away from the flavors. Overall I can see why people would enjoy this if big boozy belgians are your thing. I personally don't have the want to drink this more than once a year at most. 539 characterspepsican, Jul 17, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Westvlyteren 12 pours a deep hazy dark brown to ruby body with plenty of yeast floating about. The aromas are just about everything I have ever smelled in a beer. Spices of clove, cinnamon, banana, dark fruit, sweet maltiness, cocoa, bubblegum. Complex as hell. The flavor was nothing but superb with dark fruit, spice, and enough bittering. The mouthfeel is full bodied with ample carbonation. I was skeptical about this beer and usually do not like darker Belgians, but this blew me away. Yes, it is worthy of the hype and praise it gets unlike many rare hyped American beers. 
Thanks to atsprings for splitting this bottle. 627 charactersrtratzlaff, Jul 13, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to afatty for the in-person trade. Poured into a Corsendonk tulip a hazy, murky brown with a nice light tan head that lasts as a thin layer that leaves slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is an incredible blend of sweet fruits, brown sugar, clove, spices and numerous other aromas that just add up to spectacular. The taste is more of the same, just about everything you look for in a beer all melded perfectly into one. The beer is medium bodied with decent alcohol presence, but with a taste that good, you barely notice. This one certainly lives up to the hype, and thanks to afatty's generosity, I look forward to trying it again! 648 charactersatsprings, Jul 13, 2009
4.81/5  rDev +4.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle into chalice. Massive (and very heartfelt) thanks to Dev (Buckeyesox) for including this as an extra, alongside other equally amazing extras in the middle of a trade that was awesome in and of itself. Drinking with my wife to celebrate the birth of our first daughter a week ago - her first beer since birth. Edit: Dev passed away a week after this review. I'll always remember drinking this beer in celebration of the new life that came into our family, so soon before Dev passed on. A great loss to the BA community. You will be missed, Dev. 
Pours dark, cola-brown, very lightly hazy, with a very thin off-white head. This one is a bit disappointing, but I have no idea what year this is, and honestly, I'm not going to care if it tastes the way I hope it will. 
Nose is fantastic as expected. Notes of dark fruit and mollasses, toffee and brown sugar, spicy yeast and even a bit of earthy anise. Some phenols give a light spicy complexity that combines with just a hint of alcohol. Beautiful.
Taste is more of the delicious same - malt driven and fruity, with a dark malty sweetness that pulls out raisins and dried candied plums, molasses and brown sugar, with a spicy phenol presence and just a bit of alcohol underneath livening things up. There's a candy, "sugar in the raw" note in there as well, some toffee, and a very light, earthy bitterness leading into a finish that I can only describe as perfect - bready, dark fruits, rich dark brown sugar that's just a bit caramelized. Perfect combination of dryness and malt sweetness. Phenomenal.
Mouthfeel is very nice but not flawless - sharp but sparse and not overbearing in the slightest, with a body that is light but full somehow. Taste lingers steadfastly after every swallow and is sublime. 
Drinkability is really perfect. Alcohol is there but not at all overbearing, flavor is unbelievably complex but balanced and even the mouthfeel tends towards emphasizing drinkability.
What it all comes down to is that every time you pick out a flavor with this one, there's a subtlety and clarity to it that is just striking. Everything just rings true with every aspect of it. I'm humbled to be drinking this thanks to the generosity of a man I feel truly blessed to have met through this website, which only adds to the depth of quality I suppose. Lives up to the hype. 2,340 charactersJohnQVegas, Jul 12, 2009

Aroma is very fruity--lots of dark fruits (plum, apple, and fig) plus some honey. Flavor is nice and fruity, with yeast notes and a rich malt base. The palate sort of had a pulp-like quality to me. Very nice and delicious! I can't wait to try this again. 324 charactersLilBeerDoctor, Jul 11, 2009

This is a great beer, but I believe just a notch below Rochefort 10. 323 charactersjrallen34, Jul 11, 2009
4.95/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A--Popped the cap and this one was a gusher, I probably should have let it settle for longer since it just arrived via FedEx 2 hours ago. Luckily it was a slow gusher and I only lost probably a half-ounce of beer total. Very dark brown in color with a full finger of camping head. Some nice sheets of lacing are left behind in my Dogfish Head signature glass
S--Plums, raisins, wood, orange peel, alcohol burn, apples, band aid, leather. You really have to let this one marinate because there is a new surprise around every corner
T--Behold, the famed Westy 12. Now I "get" it. I always wondered how a beer that people claimed was so unique could be so universally acclaimed. After all, one-of-a-kind flavor often can be polarizing. So where was the negative backlash? One sip and it all becomes clear. There is absolutely nothing offensive about this beer. How could anyone possibly NOT like this? I can't say whether this is the best beer I've ever had, because comparing it to other styles is difficult. But without question, this is the best Quad/BSDA I've ever had (and I've had all of the top rated ones). I'm not going to go into all the flavors, there are plenty of reviews for that. Just know that this is one smooth, complex, tasty mother of a beer
M--Full bodied and creamy with a slight carbonation sting
D--I really feel ashamed to be chugging this like I am. I can't help it. This is spectacular. This and HOTD Adam are the two most drinkable +10% ABV beers I have ever had. All around this beer is amazing, mind blowing, unbelievable. The hype is real. I need more. I will get more. I must get more. 1,618 charactersalcstradamus, Jul 10, 2009

A: Pours a rich deep mohagany color that produces a fizzly white head that retains well and leaves nice lacing along the glass. Little brown spots appear in the head over time.
S: Champagne yeast, alcohol, dark fruits (figs/plums/pears/dates/cherries), candy, bubblegum, malts. Very complex...I can only imagine the care and technique that it takes to craft this brew.
T: Soooo good. Dark fruits are nice and sweet while the bitterness is perfectly balanced. Malts are hugee in this brew.
MF/D: Very chew brew for its style (although not as chewy as I have heard). Superbly smooth, finishes clean and velvety.
To be honest, I was expecting more, but still a ridiculous brew
This brew was born in November of 2008 which makes it only half a year old. I must say that I got a little anxious to try this one. Still have one more that I plan on aging for a long while. 912 charactersscottyshades, Jul 09, 2009

Smelled of dark fruit, brandy. Taste of dark fruit as well, raisin, cherry, fig, a little warm, in the finish. This was pretty fizzy in the mouth which surprised me as it didn't look very carbonated when I poured it. Amazing beer and I'm glad I was able to sample this. 391 charactersmugglesandhops, Jul 07, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: A deep reddish brown color, nearly opaque. A nice looking beige head of about 3 cm with good retention leaves plenty of lacings.
S: A deep and rich smell. Plenty of fruity aromas (cherries, plums, overripe strawberries), raisins, wet wood. The malty backbone is thick and "dark" and is accompanied by a prominent spicy aroma. A hint of yeast. The alcohol is noticeable, but very integrated with the rest of the aromas. A great smell.
T: The taste is nothing but fantastic. A noble and rich malty backbone and semi-sweet cherries converge with a prominent, but not very strong, taste of alcohol. At this point, the beer is quite reminiscent of a fine liqueur. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Raisins adds another sweet component. Earthy yeast and spices balance the massive sweetness. Faint nutty aromas, and perhaps just a minimal hint of tartness. In the finish, the alcohol is very noticeable and has a sweet and warming character. But the alcohol is very well integrated and suits the beer nicely. The finish is slightly bitter with notes of spices, iron and grass. 
M: Full-bodied with a velvety smooth texture. The rather high level of carbonation is well suited for the overall character. 
D: What to say about this legendary brew? Well, I think it's almost as good as it's reputation say it is. It's just unbelievably tasty with an impressive complex character. This one comes really close to perfection. 1,417 charactersricke, Jul 06, 2009

Smells of bourbon, raisins, dark fruits, honey, candi sugar and a phenol character. Tastes of fruit, honey and dark malts. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, tingles the tongue and finishes smooth.

There are a few aspects to the aroma of this beer. Dark, dried fruits; raisins, prunes, even dried apricot. Chocolate, coffee, and sweet toffee and caramel. Burnt toast.
Taste begins on a fruity note. Apricots, plums, prunes, raisins. Slightly bitter chololate on the sides of the palate. Alcohol is not well hidden. The roasted malt is not overly sweet, and the finish is not completely dry.
Medium bodied, with a soft carbonation 507 charactersEatsTacos, Jun 21, 2009

No head or lacing to speak of has me a bit worried given this beer's rich tradition. Nose is wonderful and complex. Notes of candi sugar, dark fruit, anise and caramel. Taste is complex as well and nearly as great as the boquet. Amazing synthesis of flavors. Mouthfeel is too thin and the beer lacked enough carbonation. Alcohol was there but overwhelmed by the amazing flavor. A great beer but I would like to have one with a bit more carbonation. 561 charactersNick3, Jun 17, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Reviewed with the help of capra12 and Jimmy
Poured into a snifter
A: Poured a slightly cloudy, rich brown color like dark brown sugar. Formed about a 1.5 finger head, very tight with small bubbles, ivory in color. Moderate retention and left a nice, even lacing.
S: Most of the noticeable notes were very balanced, none overly pronounced compared to the others. Included were slight notes of alcohol, rich berries, and faint notes of molasses and pear. Again, no one aroma overpowered the others.
T: From the opening through the finished, there exists a very complex blend of flavors. It is an extremely balanced combination of alcohol, berries, and dark malts, with mild to medium levels of carbonation. The moderate finish trails off evenly leaving a slightly sweet and alcoholic aftertaste.
M: Full-bodied, but not too heavy.
D: For a quadrupel, drinkability is very good, as the alcohol taste and weight of the beer are not obnoxious.
Myself, capra12, and Jimmy were in agreement that we simply cannot wait to enjoy this beer again. 1,043 characterswheatman106, Jun 17, 2009

Deep mahogany appearance, strong brown head with excellent lace.
Nose is fruity with strong malt with chocolate notes, hops are low.
Flavor is malt upfront with raisiny/fruity esters. Chocolate flavors predominate in the middle. Hops are very low, bit in the finish.
Mouthfeel is chewy with nice creaminess and carbonation.
Drinkibility is good, a beer for a cold nite.

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My first review... I traveled 12,000 miles for this beer - was it worth the journey? Or would it leave me wondering why I ever left my tropical paradise?
A - Poured into a Westvleteren chalice. Beautifully dark brown, with a thick creamy white head. Perfect.
S - Earthy and spicy. Somehow stronger, more complex, yet more delicate than anything I've tried. 
T - Absolutely amazing! Spicy, some banana and dark fruit. Alcohol just comes though to remind me it's there. Somewhat similar to St. Bernardus, but deeper and more refined.
M - Silky and creamy. It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited. Excellent.
D - I could drink this forever - or at least until I pass out. I get ready to order another, but then I remember that I've already sampled the Blonde and the 8, and I've got a 2 mile bike ride ahead of me. Better stop while I'm ahead.
Easily the best beer I've had. Yes, there's a degree of mystique added given that it's also so rare. But seriously - try it! 992 charactersjuicestam, Jun 13, 2009

(not quite, but.... it was damn good)
I am in Belgium at my computer sipping as i rate this beer
A: The beer pours a ruddy brown color with a medium sized foamy head that dissipated more quickly than expected, mild lacing.
S: It smells well... like heaven. Absurd amounts of smoky rich malts and vanilla tingle the nostrils. One can detect spices and citrus; perhaps even molasses?
T: Wonderful, a perfect balance of yeast and overpowering malts engulf my taste buds caressing each section of my tongue. Hops levels are low and overpowered by the rich malts.
M: Average at best. Upon first sipping, it stung my tongue to the point where it almost overwhelmed the otherwise perfect flavor. Over carbonated i would say. However its body was perfect after the carbonation sting subsided. Felt like I was drinking some sort of evil IPA.
D: Minus the carbonation, amazing the malts and flavor are absolutely perfect this is a beer that would suit any meal or weather.
Overall this was an excellent beer. I can see why it is the best in the world. I personally would not give it such a grand title because of its less than steller lacing and mouth feel however this is truly a great beer that i found myself in awe of. 1,325 charactersHopBacchus, Jun 12, 2009
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to NorCalYeti for sharing his bottle with me. Very excited to try the #1 ranked beer and am hoping it doesn't disappoint.
Poured into my Maudite snifter and am met with a caramel color, a thin layer of head and some major sediment.
An aroma of burnt toast, bourbon and some dark fruits seem to be the major smells.
The taste is smooth and silky though the alcohol seems to be easily identifiable and somewhat distracting. As the beer warms, the intensity of the liquor qualities increases.
Overall I was very happy to try this beer, but I really wanted to be blown away but unfortunately I wasn't. I would still drink this in a heartbeat but the price of a bottle just wasn't worth it to me. 702 characterskaseydad, Jun 12, 2009
4.48/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance - Dark, somewhat hazy brown, small head and nice lacing
Smell - Typical quad fruitiness, with strong suggestion of spice. Sweet smell after a while consisting of dark fruits and sugar
Taste/Mouthfeel - Strong fruity sweetness, with slight bite at the end. No notable alcohol presence, which is odd at over 10%. Sugary, almost caramel flavor as it warms. Not watery, but not syrupy, just the right consistency.
Drinkability - Complete. Equally as filling as any light beer or soda. This beer could be drank with any meal, in any weather, at any time, and as much as is possible.
Though this was one of the more enjoyable beers I've ever had, I think it's hype and limited availability have propelled it to #1. It's deserving of a top 10, but for it's rarity I think St. Bernardus Abt 12 makes a great substitute. 826 characterssgsmfdoom, Jun 08, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Figured I'd finally pull this one out of the fridge for the occasion of my 50th review. Poured into a Chimay glass.
Body is a very dense, dark, and cloudy brown. Forms a medium sized light brown head with mediocre retention but lacing is excellent.
The aromas start off with the figs and other sweet dark fruits expected of the style along with some great graham-crackery malts and yeast. Also some bitter grassy hops in the background.
Along with the style-requisite dark fruits picked up on the aroma I'm also getting some anise, ginger bread, toffee, and almond flavors on first sip. Hop bitterness is slightly more assertive than in other beers in this style, especially in the aftertaste. As it warms fruit sweetness becomes more easily identifiable with more fig and some faint cherries. 
Good carbonation is complimented by a slight alcohol tingle to create an enjoyable mouthfeel. Incredibly drinkable for the style but because of the difficulty obtaining this I don't anticipate having more than one of these in a sitting unless I'm in Belgium.
Overall I enjoyed this one very much. One of the best examples of this style out there, although probably not number one according to my personal tastes. Still, this would definitely be a regular if it were more readily available. 1,289 charactersberkey, Jun 07, 2009

Here it is. The Big Kahuna. The one and only. The number one beer in the world, or is it?
Appearance: Dark , dark brown body. Solid finger of white head. Nice lacing. Just picture perfect. Wish I had taken a picture.
Nose: Stronger than 8, much more spice. Sweet/spice combo that really makes an impression.
Taste: Spicy strength, but restrained. Dark fruit and caramel/molasses. This defines complexity. A relatively simple initial sip turns into so much more.
Mouthfeel: Here's where it really glows. Tingly spice, slightly numbing, like cloves. Slick and frothy. 
Drinkability: Deceptive and tantalizing. Easy to drink. Is this 10%? I can't tell, but I know I want more... 
It is #1 for a reason. Please try it if you can. 827 charactersghostwalker, Jun 07, 2009

A: Beatiful pour. Dark brown with a nice frothy tan head, about an inch thick. With a minute or two, the head diminishes by about half. Nice tiny carbonation bubbles hugging the side.
S: Belgian yeast; sweet dark fruit---raisins, prunes, etc...; caramel
T/M: Caramel malt and dark fruit are prominent. Classic quad flavors. The caramel really lingers through the finish. Mouthfeel is dry and carbonated. Given the overly rich American brews that suck ever little bit of your taste buds down with each sip, this is a welcome change. I'd almost call it refreshing. Excellent, excellent beer.
D: Extremely high. I can't believe this is a 10% beer. Slight booziness on the finish, but there's no way I'd guess it was that high.
The best beer in the world? A lot of the hype certainly comes from how difficult it is to obtain. It's certainly a world-class beer. We'll just leave it at that. 918 charactersabfraser, Jun 03, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I decided to pick out something good for my 200th review. I do not think it gets much better than this. 11.2 oz bottle purchased at the monastery by my friend for me. Poured into the Westvleteren chalice that he also bought for me at the cafe across the street from the Abbey.
A: Pours a dark brown with small tan head. The tiny bubbles really stick to the side of the glass as the beer is consumed.
S: Belgian yeast, sweet smelling malt, dark fruit aroma (raisin), and alcohol is the best I can describe the aroma. I am sure there is even more to this complex brew, but the aroma is a bit subdued.
T: All the pieces from the aroma mix together to make one of the most rich flavors of any beers I have ever had. There is more going on, but I am too inexperienced to pick them all up. I started into good beer via Belgian ales, and this is easily the best of any of them I have ever had. It deserves the hype it gets.
M: It feels thick bodied at times, but if I was forced I would call it more of a medium body. The in mouth carbonation level is perfection for the style. It is nice and smooth and a joy to just roll around on the tongue.
D: You sip this one because you want to savor every drop. The ABV does cause you to slow down a little as well, but not more than you want to anyway.
Those monks sure know how to brew a fantastic beer. 1,345 charactersGatorBeerNerd, Jun 02, 2009

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5March of 2007 I went to the abbey cafe at St. Sixtus and had all the Westvleteren beers. I never had the chance to review them so this time when I was in Belgium I took some notes...
Had this bottle at Cambrinus in Brugge, it was not cheap but not too over the top. (6.95 euro, the same as at de Bier Tempel in Brussels)
Pours a deep dark brown with very little head yet it was very persistent and did not seem to be fading whatsoever.
Smell is very sweet caramel/brown sugar, stewed fruit, cooked cherries and a very slight whiff of alcohol.
Taste is ridiculously smooth for the strength. Wow. Lots of complexity to say the least. Toasted brown bread, sweet caramel and brown sugar, sweet dark fruit with a super nice clean smooth finish. 
This is a very nice treat at @$10usd while over in Belgium. I saw at the most in Brugge and at differing prices. My first experience with this beer a few years ago at the abbey cafe was completely unforgettable. 957 charactersindiapaleale, May 26, 2009

A = Decanted into chalice. Dark brown with light hints of amber light coming through the edges. Light head quickly receded with light lacing.
S = Smells of yeast, dark fruit and alcohol. Pretty typical quad aroma. 
T = Very complex blend of sweet malts, begian yeast, and an array of dark fruits. I'm picking up dates, raisins, prunes, overripe apples with strong brown sugar. Also, a very apparent boozy flavor and heat on the back. Hard not to appreciate what went into brewing this beer, even if this isn't your style. 
M = Best quality of this beer to me. Just perfectly executed mouthfeel with a subtle carbonation and a bit chewy but not overdone. Very, very well crafted. 
D = Very drinkable considering the ABV. Not a session (duh), but its taste and mouthfeel more than make up for the booziness and high ABV. This is meant to be sipped and savored. 
Overall, quite impressed and appreciative of the opportunity to try it. Definitely world class. 996 charactersJonMich13, May 25, 2009

03.12.11 printed on the cap.
Pours a very dark amber brown color with almost no head and no lacing. I thought I would was going to have a hugely carbonated beer here, but it doesn't seem to look that way. Lovely aroma of yeast, dark sugar, apples, plums, raisins, brandy, hints of chocolate and a light booziness. Wow, I could smell this all night and keep coming up with more familiar aromas. Taste is off the charts. This tastes like a dark Belgian beer with a few drops of brandy splashed in. Strong caramel and toffee flavors are at the forefront followed by a nice boozy brandy flavor, dark fruit, namely raisins, a bit of chocolate, lightly bitter earthiness from the hops, sweet, delicious, satisfying. Wow, this beer really does live up to the hype. So much complexity in the flavor. It's truly outstanding. Medium-full bodied, lower carbonation than what I was expecting. Boozy warmth becomes more prevalent as it warms up in the glass. Delicious aftertaste seems to linger forever. 
What a great beer. I can certainly see why it's the top rated in the world. While it's not my highest rated beer, it's certainly deserving of it's praise. Very drinkable despite the high ABV, which is virtually absent in the taste. So good. I will cherish the remaining bottles I have and drink them a bottle at a time over the next few years. Thanks again, Jason! 1,475 charactersKeefD, May 20, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a medium brown body with hints of red/orange around the edges. Short tan head.
Nose of deep rich fruit and malt. Hints of raisins and stone fruit. Hints of complex malt and toffee/carmel/whiskey. Flavors were rich, bold, assertive, long lasting and fantastic.
Front palate hits you with sweet malt and the flavors just grow in layers; malt, whiskey, raisins, figs and a bit of light chocolate. 
The beer just reeks of complexities and character. This is one of the best liquids I've tasted, and I've tasted some nice stuff, including some of the rarest and oldest wines in the world. This beer ranks right up there.
I love old stouts and some of the crazy extreme beers that are now being produced. However, for overall quality and flavor this is probably the best ale I've ever tasted. I hope I can try it again. Don't miss this one if you get the chance! 866 charactersGRG1313, May 19, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle poured into a Trappist Westvleteren chalice
Pours a medium chestnut body with a reddish tinge. A rather ominous, murky body. A sandy colored head rose to fill the chalice.
Hmmm, pretty complex. Both broad and deep. Golden raisins hit me at first with dark cherries, licorice, cocoa powder, and a meaty, bready quality.
At first sip, I was taken back by the complexity. Sweet malts dominate the flavor with a spicy character begging to be reckoned with. Golden raisins and figs with dark cherries are the flavors I get the most of, but there are a good amount of licorice, cocoa powder and a hearty bready complexity as well.
A velvety, hearty, luscious mouthfeel. Medium to full body, but drinks much easier than that. 
This beer nears perfection in drinkability. I could not wait to take my next sip.
Definitely one of the best beers I have ever had. 869 charactersColForbinBC, May 17, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The Westvleteren is 1 year aged. Pours a hazy mahogany with a decent sized head. It looked like it would be a gusher at first, but didn't quite make it over the top. The head dissipates quickly. It smells largely of dark fruits, with a bitterness combined with it. There is also a sweetness combined with it as well. The alcohol comes through slightly in the smell, but not to strong. The taste is filled with tons of spices and dark fruits. The alcohol has largely mellowed into the taste, though there is a warming sensation to the beer. The bitterness blends nicely into the taste, though there is a slight dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is as smooth as I've ever had a beer. The beer goes down smooth and is very drinkable. If I ever head over to Belgium, I'll enjoy myself a few. 783 charactersJablonski, May 10, 2009
4/5  rDev -13.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured a diet coke without the ice color that gave a small tannish head.
Aroma is caramel..brown sugar...dark fruits
Tast is much of the same with the ABV hidden nicely
Mouthfell is rather nice and has a decent carbonation.. 
Not the most drinkable beer in my cellar. But I had to try it to see the hype of the #1 beer around. 328 charactersstonequarrywest, May 08, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My friend broke a bottle out today as we were hanging out, it was a 2007 bottle aging in his wine/beer fridge. 
Pours a nice deep mahogany color with a slightly tan billowing head, with some belgian lacing. Large amount of sediments, but not distracting.
Smell is typical Trappist beer, sweet malt, some dried fruits, carmelized candy sugars, chocolate, spice from the yeast, not hot alcohols. 
Taste was well, lack luster upon the first sip. However, as I took second, third, etc. the beer opened up as a masterpiece of malty sweetness, yet dry finishing, with hints of dark caramelized sugar, chocolate, sherry, tawny port like flavors, dark fruits, slight yeast spice. But most of all well balanced, especially for the abv. I really relate this beer to a after dinner sipper like a tawny port, or a dry sherry.
Good body, but not too big even for the abv. Very well hidden alcohol, and finishes dry.
Overall, this beer did not disappoint. It was certainly a treat and an honor to share with a good friend. The 12 oz was probably the right amount of beer for two people to drink. It is a great sipping beer and would be a perfect after dinner or special occasion beer. No off flavors or hot alcohols at all, very, very well crafted beer. 1,244 charactersWeeObese, May 02, 2009

A: A dark murky brown color with a off white head. It has some debris floating in it.
S: Sweet carmel and molasses aroma with some fruitiness. A hint of the alcohol does come through the aroma.
T: A sweetness from fruits, candi syrup and carmel. Toasted malt coming through with alcohol warming. Yummy!
M: A medium bodied beer with high carbonation. Sweetness with a alcohol warming. Soon after a swallow your mouth is wanting more.
O: This is truly an outstanding beer. I sure all the hype surrounding it adds to the mystic of it. There no evidence this is a 10% beer. It is very well hidden. Thanks to my son, Geoff for a great birthday present! 777 charactersSmithwicksNut, Apr 29, 2009
4.33/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to my new found friend Andersand for buying this one from a store in Denmark. Really cool to finally try the one most hyped beer in the world!
Westvleteren 12 pours a clear, deep amber color with a nice white-ish foam. Looks quite nice, but you don't know what to expect.
Aroma is really promising on this one. Lots of burnt sugar, belgo yeast, but also some really amazing wineous notes. Really good aroma anyways, but I've smelled trappists that smell better!
Taste is amazing! Definetively the greatest tasting of all the Trappistes. Lots of burnt almonds, belgo yeast and nice hints of dried fruits. The alcohol is perfectly warming, not disturbing in any way. I was expecting to get dissapointed, as I think it's so hyped, but it surprised me, in a good way!
If you get the chance, try it. But don't pay like 80 USD for it, there are better beers out there! 873 charactersBananaman, Apr 26, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Of course I had to try this beer. I found it in my local liquorstore, in stock (I guess they made the ride to West-Vleteren for it).
The beer is very dark, doesn't foam a lot, it has flaky floaty bits in it.
The smell is the best I've come across in a beer. Dried fruits and cherries, good bread, coffee, caramel, roasted grains and seeds, also floral. Something in it hit me and woke me up, very complex and Sublime!
The taste, consequently, is also very good: full range of bitter from nice hops, coffee/choco, sweet from dried fruits, slightly sour from cherries/kriek, plus the roasted seeds, very chewy indeed. 
I have to be honest and give this beertaste a 5 too.
And so drinkable too, very well masked alcohol.
5 years along the line, in 2014, it's still very great. I've had some similar smells in beer since then, from f.i. Struise brouwers, but the taste seems somehow different. It's very strong and powerfull of almonds. Quite overwhelming I would say, and it throws the beer a bit off balance. It changed my taste note from 5 to 4,75.
Still it's a must try, highly recommended after this time. 1,109 charactersRuudJH, Apr 24, 2009

smells of fig, rum, caramel and rich chocolate.
very very smooth and drinkable for its high alcoholic content, very rummy, warming, with a tad of spice that has smoothed out, i can tell there used to be more.
m- medium bodied and full of flavor. very chunky once swished around and leaves a very thin amount of cloying malt on the palate. 
d- wish this beer wasnt so rare and expensive but i could drink this every day for the rest of my life. in fact, if i ever get on death row, this will be my final supper. 680 charactersslayer3604, Apr 23, 2009
4.55/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Hugenormous thanks to buckeysox for this extra!
Poured from the brown bottle into an oversized merlot glass.
A good inch of foamy off white head. Extremely long lasting head. I cant tell if its retention or the head is still receeding.
A brownish color with some light glowing of reds, but still pale and non transparent. 
The head has finally fallen leaving a quarter inch of egg white like whipped topping and plenty of white drapeing lace.
Aroma is devine. Smells of french toast with just a little spice/ cinnemon aroma, some dairy like eggyness, lemon zest, vanilla, anise, brown sugar, and some raisin de'extra similarities with, raisin and alcahol aroma. By no means hot, its a super appealing aroma here. Some floral rose pedals, honey, and a mild grassy hop aroma.
Mouthfeel is unbelievably rich and creamy with a thicker feel. Some carbonation present into the foreground but quickly dissapearing into a creamy thickness. God almighty, I havnt had a belgian with a mouthfeel like this ever, awsome!
The taste is also very drinkable and delicious, I'm really enjoying this brew and have waited along time to get it. I honestly didnt think I'd ever get a chance to try one.
Some fermented fruityness up front with fermented honey, spices, anice and plenty of floral honey suckle like taste. Some bready yeastyness, like a sourdough bread with plenty of honey butter, a touch of sour apples, and a bit of earthy piney hops into the finish. Some more citric lemon zest flavors also coming into the linger with a bit of a citric acid likeness, comparable to drinking orange juice with that slightest bit of citric acid after effect. 
As its warmed It picked up more of the sweet candy sugar typical belgian flavors. Some burnt toast like grain flavors, they roasty flavors of the grain with that candy sugar sweetness is delicious.
This is hugely drinkable, its not hot, does not bully the tastebuds, its a simple/ humble yet extravagent beer at the same time. Nothing bragging like here, its got a humble bottle with no lable and its just a really enjoyable beer.
Thanks again Dave, I really appreciate this one! 2,124 charactersBuebie, Apr 22, 2009

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was certainly a special tasting for my developing palate. I want to deeply thank my friend Tyler for blessing me with this pinnacle of beer as a 26th birthday present. This superior belgian ale poured an opaque, cloudy dark amber hue from the bottle. The perfection in this brew lies in both the flavor and the balance. The flavor is complex, yet sweet on the tongue at first with hints of banana, raisins, plums, strawberries, and dates. The finish is of smokey dark fruit with a pleasant warmth of alcohol down the throat. This ale truly has every important aspect you could hope for in a beer. The flavors work in perfect harmony together, with neither over powering one another. The carbonation is subdued, yet present enough to remind you that this is a truly special belgian ale. I am truly amazed at the subtle, yet complex collection of flavors present in this ale. For those that are considering trying this ale for the first time, please take my advice and enjoy all of the wonderful flavors at room temperature. This brew achieves true perfection, and I am honored to have experienced the world's greatest ale on my birthday. Thank you Tyler. 1,158 charactersDopplebock, Apr 18, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5(From notes - can't resist reviewing even though my input is negligible with so many reviews already)
A - Dark, deep coppery brown color and poured with a long-staying slightly tan head. Noticeable sediment toward the bottom of the glass, and some lacing through the sample. 
S - Sweet passion fruits, dark sweet maltiness, candied aromas. (I'm really afraid I'm not qualified to review this brew)
T - Toffee; flavor that reminds me of a melted/reduced cane sugar; pruney and raisiny and deeply maltly.
M - Medium MF, with a nice bubbly carbonation presence. Really coats the entirity of the mouth. 
D - Pretty insane drinkability for a quad, though it is definitely a sipper. The intriquing flavors and sweetness definitely piqued my interest and was curious to see how the brew changed as it warmed. 
Overall, again very glad to have tried this brew and it is indeed wonderful stuff. The flavors and warming touch of booze really provided a pleasant experience. Against the style, it might just be the best I've had. As to whether it's the best brew in the world, I'm not quite sure. Definitely try it if you have the chance. 1,133 charactersNickls, Apr 15, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Pours dark brown, a small amount of light peers through my Dogfish Head snifter. Small amount of off-white head that quickly disappears leaving a small amount of bubbles and a some around the glass. 
S - Smell is amazing...sweet candy, cherries, apples, plums, malt, burnt sugars. 
T - This beer is sweet, but not overly so. Lots of fruits, sugars, candy, all very balanced...for the taste, perfectly balanced and not overdone with a clean finish. 
M - Light (leaning towards medium) bodied, perfectly carbonated, and smooth. 
D- I am going to revisit this one as much as possible, but this beer is not something I'd consider going to a bunch. Every now and then will keep this one special. 698 charactersSean9689, Apr 14, 2009

You have to be brain dead to not like this beer. It was a religious experience, it smelled like a church, tasted like heaven and had the body of the Holy Trinity. But if you're reviewing this beer i'm not telling you anything you don't know. Not sure how you get much better than this... 478 charactersMurchmac, Apr 12, 2009

Pours slightly fogged brown. Nose is malty. Darker sugars. Flavor is bringing much of the same. I want to say it is kind of boozy as well. Not sure if some age would mellow that out. Malty plums start to appear as it warms. Rich, yes. Smooth, yes. Feel is quite smooth on liquid. Carbonation is middle of the road. I like this, yes. It's good. But I feel like this is a bit tight and might need more age to develop more noticeable complexities. And it's certainly not my favorite beer ever. 578 charactersRblWthACoz, Apr 11, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I bought a bottle of this almost two years ago, then gave another bottle to my brother as a gift, and tonight, on Good Friday 2009, we're drinking our bottles together. They are 11.2 oz bottles - mine has a date of 10.02.10. Unlabeled, with the yellow cap. 10.2% ABV. Decanted into chalices.
Appearance is darker than I expected. Almost like a cola. Nice frothy, off-white head. Caramel color, with reddish edges. Mostly opaque. Great head retention - it lasted the whole time I drank it. You can see multiple columns of carbonation. (Side note: we poured off most of the beer, but not all of it; there's just under an inch of yeasty sludge at the bottom.
Aromas are great, and they only got better as the beer warmed up. The chalice really helped to open things up. Definite yeast aromas, some hints of cola. More smells of dark fruit: cherry, plum. Apples - especially apple skins. As it warms, there's more brown sugar and maple syrup. I really loved sticking my nose in this. There were so many other spices I just couldn't identify.
Tastes were very good, too. Definitely sweet, but not overly sweet. It's balanced, but there's no real bitterness to it - as in, no hint of any hops. Aromas of yeast, apples, apple cider, with a strong bready center. As it warmed, there it grew more tart, like granny smith apples. Tastes of apple skins at the back of the throat. It definitely hides the alcohol, although I can feel it.
Mouthfeel is awesome. It's so wonderfully smooth. Great carbonation, but it doesn't bite the tongue. Very consistent.
This is a very drinkable beer. You need to sip it because of the higher alcohol, but it's really fun to drink. Very dynamic - most definitely worth trying. If you can get ahold of a bottle - do it! This would go really well with a good meal. My wife said this beer was "savory and sweet, like a good roast." I could see this going well with a big platter of fruit, crusty bread, and cheese. 1,939 charactersndekke39, Apr 11, 2009

A: Poured into a round goblet, I let some sediment get in there, so there are some floaties goin' around. The color is a deep mahogany with some caramel colored hues as well. The head isn't what I wanted it to be, although I didn't pour it too hard. No lacing for me, really.
S: Lots of dark, ripened fruity aromas: raisins, cherries, and plums. A little licorice, and some yeasty notes too.
T: Some similarities, but others too: again, the dark fruity flavors, but then more sweetness and tartness (apple-like), some bready elements, and a bittersweet aftertaste - not much hoppiness to note, but it is very well balanced. The alcohol was hardly detectable despite the high content, but eventually it sets in.
M: Very, very smooth, despite the fact that it's well-carbonated. Not sticky, but a little chewy. Near perfect.
D: The high alcohol content would prevent a huge consumption of it, but as it's not noticeable, so it doesn't prevent me from wanting more. It actually went down really easily, and overall it was a really enjoyable brew. I'd gladly buy more if I could find it and it wasn't so expensive. 1,259 charactersMDekker, Apr 11, 2009

A- Pours a brown color with a moderately sized head. Lacing is really tight to the brew as the head falls, but it doesn't last terribly long. Looks very good and had a few floaters in there as well.
S- Smells of caramel, raisin, dark chocolate, plum, grape, toffee, roasted nuts, and bready. Every whiff I think I noticed something different a lot going on here. 
T- A lot more sweet than I thought. The flavours exploded more when I let this one warm up. Tons of sweetness up front with hints of dark fruit, raisins, and banana with caramel and candy. The spice flavour of clove comes in towards the back end with the lingering fruity sweetness coming back in. Nice long aftertaste. Let this beer warm up and all the flavors get more pronounced. Seemed like a ton of brown sugar here as well.
M- Medium in body and carbonation was just about perfect.
D- It was easy to drink and fun for sure. Nothing that I could drink all day or on a regular basis but was damn easy to drink. 1,059 charactersnrbw23, Apr 10, 2009

At first I was "best beer in the world?" but it started to grow on me with each sip. I kept it on my tongue and rolled it around. The mouthfeel is luscious with a perfect balance of carbonation and dryness. I haven't felt that since say St Benardus 12. But St. Benardus isn't a substitute for the fruitiness that this beer imparts. I expected more in the aroma department but the flavor more than makes up for it. 497 charactersPAYankeeFan, Apr 07, 2009

A- Westy is a dark muddled brown with some light seen coming through the top looking beneath the glass. A bunch of tiny balls of debris came from a careful pour but oh well. A creamy dark tan sheet of semi dense foam was good looking. Spider web lacing.
S- A candi sweetness with burnt (turbinado) sugar and a nice malt build. On top of that raisins are up front with some more sweet toffee/caramel. Figs plus some ripe apples and plums. Bubblegum and a hint of heat from the Alcohol.
T- Yes, Yes, Yes. Twelve has a nice sweetness with a bunch of raisins intermingled with some prune and other dark fruits. The sweet consists of Dates and some burnt sugars and some bubblegum. Toasted malt as well. In the middle a well warm leather comes forth. When warm the belgian yeast comes forth giving off a slighty sour vibe. The sediment really gives this another character all together plus a nice spicy finish.
M- Very sweet and medium bodied. The flavors just keep coming ounce after ounce leaving the mouth wanting more. Perhaps the best mouthfeel I have ever had within this style, it just goes glides down without question. Smooth textured and a breeze to drink. A bit of a hot patch felt in the back of the throat but im thinking it's from some of the spices, in other words not a problem.
D- Not sessionable but the 10 plus percent is hardly evident in the taste or feel and this is a wonderful quad. What else can I say. Well one thing is each sip is better than the last sip I took. westy 12 is a creamy sweet ride with a body of epic proportions. Cant wait till I try it again 1,695 charactersBARFLYB, Apr 05, 2009

Pours an amber brown with a small head that quiclkly fades away. The nose on this baby is amazing. Lots of sweet malts, dark fruits, plums, figs, raisins and candi sugar. There is soo much complexity. some alcohol in there as well. Taste is similar to smell. Very complex, dark fruits, candi sugar not as much alcohol as the smell would indicate. Feels nice in your mouth good carbonation and kind of creamy when swallowed. This was an amazing beer what else can I say. I mean its Westvleteren 12. 714 charactersscifan, Apr 04, 2009

A - Pours a brownish, slightly red with little khaki head, and slight amount of lace.
S - Just as advertised, smells like so many dried fruits. Hint of alcohol, which is amazing seeing its 10.2% ABV.
T - Incredible taste of raisins, not the black ones, more like the golden ones. Reminds me of alittle bit of lemon and orange rind. Great spice and minimal alcohol, which again amazes me. Webster should change complex to Westvleteren 12.
M - This is the best part. I really don't want to swallow it. If this beer was served worldwide we would have world peace. A nice slight burn from the alcohol is just what I wanted. Good amount of carbonation but not like a can of coke thank god. Really is balanced, these others have it right.
D - I have said it a few times but you really have no idea that this is a 10.20% ABV and that is evident by how easy this is to drink. I would say this may be the perfect comfort beer as it alters the doldrums.
What an experience. This is my first review on this site but by no means is this my first beer or review. At this rate I doubt I will find a better beer. If you can find it, try Belgian stores or trade here, pull the trigger on it and don't think twice. 1,270 characterschiguy2420, Apr 03, 2009

Taste is rich and complex sweet malt, lots of dark fruit, figs, dark plums with slowly drying and light sweet finish. There is also a presence of alcohol in the taste. Mouthfeel is smooth full, light carbonation with nice alcohol warming sensation.

S - Yeah, boy! Everything you want a quad to be. Huge plum, fig, raisin, and other dark fruit aromas coupled with some leathery earth and spicy alcohol.
T - Equally joyous. Lands right between Rochefort 10, St Bernardus ABT 12, and Chimay blue. not too thick, not too hot, and complex as you can get. Beauty.
M - Again, right in the middle. perfect balance.
D - Leaves me aching for more. I envy the Belgians that much more now.
Not the best beer in the world, or the best beer I've evr had, but goddamn does it rank up there. 673 characters0110x011, Mar 31, 2009

I used to live in Paris and went to the Abbey 3 times with reservations, to buy cases. I had so much Westvleteren 12 at one point that I used a bottle to make a roast. Those were the days!
Bottle from batch February 12, 2008. Tasted March 25, 2009. 
a - Dark brown. Not crystal clear. Thin, pale head. Fading but steady, islands of creamy bubbles sail down the whole way to the bottom of the glass when it's finally empty. 
s - Malt. Caramel, alcohol, prunes, raisins. Strong smells. Complex sweetness-smells.
t - Wow. Dried fruits. Well carbonated. Alcohol/port bite is slight. It's not.. sweet, but malty, and yeah.. a little sweet. Deliciously sweet. This is awesome. This is the best malt profile ever. Belgain yeast creates a smooth, slightly estery aspect that perfectly marries the malt sweetness. It's difficult to say it's sweet because it's not cloying, at all. There is no hop character in the flavor, but clearly enough bittering to balance the rediculous malt profile.
m - creamy, well integrated CO2. Activity happening in the mouth but it's.. balanced.
d - In for a couple, but it's not a session beer due to the strength. But I could drink it 'till I passed out. Very Sad that it's over. 
Note - Take a long time to drink this. Start it cold, and drink it slow enough that it's room temperature when it's done. That way you can experience all of the nuances. 
My only perfect beer. There can be only one. 1,522 charactersjojox, Mar 26, 2009

4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to redtailjet for trading me this.
Best before date 29.10.11, so I guess this was bottled 5 months ago. Poured in a big wine glass at 57 F/ 14 C.
Opaque clowdy brown color. Small dense head. Terrific sprawling patterns of sticky lace.
Nice complex malty fruity aroma, like crusty brown bread, grapes, apples, plums, nuts, spices, and mild bubblegum. Deep, cohesive, quite alluring.
Complex fruity malty spicy flavor, with a bit of warming alcohol and solvent. A bit like Christmas pudding, sweet, dark and mysterious, with apple, and dark fruit like prune and mission fig, laced with warm spices and a moderate splash of brandy. Complex and very tasty. A bit of astringent sharpness like plum skin contributes to good balance. Long warm finish.
Rich smooth texture. A pleasure to drink.
Great beer (not that it needs my endorsement); I look forward to trying this with some age on it. 897 charactersBeerzebub, Mar 24, 2009

Pours a deep amber brown with a large tan head. Loads of lacing.

Flavor is of rich and complex malts. Tons of dark stone fruits. Pie cherry. Alcohol.
Medium in body with moderate carbonation and alcohol warmth.
A very good beer. Made the Rocherfort 10 seem rather boring. 392 charactersiasanlee, Mar 21, 2009
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had a tasting at my house this past weekend and the first beer up was the Westy 12! Appearance was good not allot of head out of every bottle but a good amount. Color was a nice cloudy dark brown and looked very yummy. Smell was not overwhelmingly intense but was there and was a big hint to the complex taste that was about to happen. Sweet malts was a dominate taste with very next up dark fruits like raisins and figs etc. The taste it's self had everyone take a step back and honestly look at each others expressions. Dark fruits raisins and figs powered threw with sweet malts. More flavors were present but could not pick each one out as the beer was so complex. A bite of Alcohol was present and was a pleasant addition. The bit of Alcohol would probably hamper the continuous bottle after another bottle. I feel for me at least this beer was meant to be a one to two bottle a session beer. 897 charactersBZero007, Mar 15, 2009

A- this pours a murky dark brown with a finger of thick looking cream colored head that lasts a while and leaves a solid ring on the sides of my glass. cant ask for anything more. 
S- sweet malts first and foremost. lots of fruits. raisins/tobacco, figs, plums, grapes, and maybe a bit of apple. some alcohol odor comes through. 
T- sweet caramel and toffee malts. lots of ripe dark fruit. cherries, raisins/tobacco, plums, figs and grapes. a hint of alcohol, that adds to the experience. extremely complex and leaves me wanting another sip immediately after i finish one. 
M- light, fluffy, and highly carbonated which i was expecting for the style. what i wasnt expecting was how smooth this one was going to be. 928 charactersjwinship83, Mar 15, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter. Murky amber-brown that lightens to a hazy gold near the top. A thin, cream colored head that remains. Leaves thick lacing around the glass above.
Smell is not intense. Raisins, plums, hint of banana. Slight floral aroma.
Very complex taste. Perhaps too much for my relatively uncultivated palate. I am probably not truly worthy of this beer. I am, however, appropriately humbled. I do know it's delicious. Raisins, bananas, little bit of booze. Nice, soft, leathery tone on the exhale.
Mouthfeel is crisp and slick with a very slight alcohol warming.
Alcohol presence is well-concealed. I have a few more bottles and would love another, but I must resist. If this wasn't as hard to come by as it is, I would have two more and call it a wonderful night.
Have a few more bottles and am looking forward to how this one tastes with age. 855 charactersWilliamD, Mar 15, 2009

A - Poured from a little brown bottle into a goblet. Pours a nice, raisiny shade of garnet/brown, brown sugar colored highlights around the edges of the glass, with a thin brown head.
S - Raisiny, plump ripe dark fruits, warm alcohol, cocoa, licorice
T - Earthy dark fruits, plums and raisins, berries, other assorted goodness. Ends with a sweet finish that is not as strong as the ABV would lead one to expect.
M - Velvety, decent carbonation. 
Notes - The best of its style, easily. I see why it is held in as high regard as it is. Exceedingly drinkable despite the high ABV percentage. 655 charactersHeyItsChili, Mar 15, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured 3/5 of bottle into a goblet. Creamy 1/4 inch of head. Lots of small bubbles. Dark rustic brown w/ red highlights around the edges w/ sediment floating around. Second pour gives a nice tan head w/ red tinge on side, small fine bubbles. Some lacing is left on glass.
S:Sweet aroma, banana, bread, chocolate, raisin all melded together. As beer warms up, smell is fantastic. My favorite thing about this beer is the smell.
T:Can't quite pick up lots of individual characteristics, but as a whole the taste is pleasant/complex. Hints of rum alcohol w/ a long finish accented w/ a touch of bitterness. 30 min after, a chocolate taste is more pronounced, doughy, vanilla, raisin bread, banana.
M: Luxurious, high amount of tight carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Spreads the flavor of around the palate and gives beer a good body. Amazing!
D: Great beer! Has a nice warming effect. Perfect beer to drink while relaxing. 924 characterssteadydose, Mar 14, 2009

BB 03.04.11 on cap. Poured into gold-rimmed La Trappe chalice.
** also tried a bottle of BB 24.05.09 **
a) Brown and murky, beige head which sinks, not much lacing. 
s) Chocolate, caramel, licorice. Warms to sugary raisin toast, malt powder.
** older sample also included cinnamon, pecan pie notes **
f) As it smells; perfumy musk candy, licorice allsorts, chocolate bullets. Very rich, very balanced. Subtle notes reminiscent of cigar box, or leather lounges, or somewhere with guys in suits called "Jeeves". Tingly, almost lemon sherbet like hint on tongue-tip, giving it a youthful zest. Quite the candy shop.
** older sample very noticable 'cherry ripe' & honeycomb characteristics
m) Rich & creamy, tongue tingly, with warming alcohol note.
d) Couldn't have too many, yet a rewarding, fireside winter warmer. Intentionally tried this as a youngster; have another one that is estimated at 3 years of age, which will compare with shortly.

4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5With my first beer review on BA, there is only room to go down. Why not start with the best?
A case of this stuff arrived at my home a few weeks ago. Me and a few friends went in to purchase it. My brother in-law and I had one a few days ago; here are my thoughts. The date on the cap says 3.12.11
A - Poured into a Westy chalice, it pours a nice carmel-brown color with a tan colored head.
S - Wow, the dried fruit scent coming from my glass was amazing. Definitely the best smelling beer I've ever had.
T - Off the charts. Yes, it is the best beer I've ever tasted. The slightly sweet finish was a surprise. Perhaps even more surprising, the alcohol is masked very well. If you told me it was 7-8% alcohol I would have believed you. In comparison to the Rochefort 10, the Westy 12 hides the alcohol much better in my opinion (yes, the Rochefort 10 does have more alcohol, but only another 1%). 
M - Felt great in the mouth, I'm not a huge judge on mouthfeel though.
D - It went down very easily, perhaps more so than I wanted. If money were no object, I'd drink it more often. As it stands, it's a couple times a year beer, or at most once every few months. I'll save my remaining 7 for special occasions.
Yes, the Westy 12 is worthy of the hype! Is it worth the money that you have to pay for it? Well, I guess that depends on how much money you make. I will most certainly buy more, but it's not something I can afford to drink even on a similar regular basis. Yes, this is my new favorite beer. 1,506 characterskfordham281, Mar 13, 2009

A- Cloudy dark-caremel brown. Small bright white head that fades to the edge around the glass.
S- One of the best smelling Belgiun's or beers I've ever smelt. Strong sweet dark fruits, sweet grape/raisin, and a scotch-like whiff of the 10.2% ABV.
T- Incredibly smooth, like no other beer.The taste is tightly complex.. the sheer smoothness makes it hard to analyze the tastes as you instinctivly swallow this nector quickly. Big unique Belgiun malt dominance up front and overall. Finishes with spice and a presence of the 10.2% ABV. 
M- Hands down the best mouthfeel I've ever experienced. Westy has this fluffy-smooth sensation that is simular to a cloud on the palate. Medium carbonation, medium bodied. 
D- I had to force myself from chuggin this beer down. THe smell, taste, and mouthfeel is just incredibly smooth making this a 5 on drinkability as its like no other. 994 charactersYesac, Mar 12, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5In a nutshell, this beer is markedly better after about ten years of aging.
Several months ago I put out a last minute request to secure a bottle of Westy 12 for my best friend and I to share on the night before his wedding. A gentleman who is a member of BA and a pioneer in the world of craft brewing came through, and provided us with nine-and-a-half year old examples of Westy 8 and 12. Both were phenomenal, and arguably the best beers either of us had ever tasted.
I'd since acquired another 12 in a trade, and figured now was as good of a time as any for my friend and I to split another bottle. While excellent, it was very different from the aged bottle. What we noticed most about the newer bottle:
- noticeably darker
- lots of alcohol on the nose and palate; the old example was much more muted. The heavy alcohol presence does take away from the experience.
- smell and taste were similar, but an inoffensive tangy bitterness that stuck around after the swallow was much more apparent in the newer example
I will likely give any future bottle of Westy at least five years of aging. I am absolutely amazed by what time does to this beer.
At the moment I'm sipping on a St. Bernardus Abt 12, as I could not resist the urge to do a back to back comparison. Here's what I've noticed:
- Bernadus 12 looks a bit better
- Westy smells slightly better
- Westy is more complex on the palate... while the two beers are similar, the individual notes of the varied flavors are simply more pronounced in Westy
- Bernardus 12 has a lot more carbonation.
- Finish is stickier with the Bernardus
- Westy tastes a bit more 'pure'; Bernardus has a slight chemical-like 'off' taste not found in the Westy
Westy is outstanding, and quite possibly the best quad on earth. That said, there are a number of other big Belgians that provide just as an involving and complex experience that are far more widely available.
Anyhow, here are my nearly undoctored notes for the 'newer' Westy 12, as I imagine that is how most will experience it.
A - Deep murky caramel with burnt orange edges, off-white, short-lasting head, minimal lacing, resilient halo remains until nearly the end
S - Raisins, prunes, varied dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, spices, big alcohol presence
T - Sweet dark fruits - raisins, dates, spices, nice malt balance, vanilla, yeasty Belgian funk, tangy bite on the sides of the tongue 
M - Chewy, soft, and creamy. Carbonation is medium for the style, and the finish is sweet, but leaves a bitterness that coats the mouth between sips. Alcohol burn is far too apparent.
Drinkability is off the charts.
I've now had eight of the top 10 beers on BA, and can confidently say that the Westies, Dark Lord, and the Plinies are not overhyped. They are the best examples of their respective styles that I've tasted. 2,831 charactersThirdLap, Mar 09, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I had my first Westy 12 6 months ago for my bachelor party thanks to my best friend and a great man of beer that donated this incredible sample for the cause.
The appearance of this beer is different than the one I had prior. Mind you the other Westy was almost 10 years old. This review is based on this bottle and I can absolutely attest to the fact that this beer ages remarkably. Westy 12 with the label on it was a much lighter beer with less of an alcohol taste and a broader spectrum of flavors.
A dark whiskey brown with dabbles of carbonation rings in the middle of the glass. An unassuming thin ring lingers around the edge.
I get a huge scent of figs, almond, dried fruits, malt with light caramel and alcohol. The smell pulls you in but could have a little less alcohol to allow the other aspects to come through more.
The ever important taste factor. Cherries with malty goodness and an aftertaste that lingers of amaretto and currants. This beer is worth allowing to warm over time just to sample the differences over the temperature band. 
The mouthfeel of this beer provides the perfect example of a true quad.
It is too bad that we have to split this beer due it's lack of availablity. But, I am glad that we have friends that would bring over what most agree as the best beer in the world on a sunday night, just because. 1,345 charactersmacktbone, Mar 09, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512 oz. bottle tried 8 Mar 2009. Date on cap is 17.10.10. Courtesy of gford217, thanks, have been wanting to try this for some time!
Poured in 0.4 L Steiner Pils tulip. Large fluffy light tan head. Medium carbonation. Beer is much darker than expected, very dark brown bordering on black, slightly cloudy. Aromas of burnt sugar, rum, raisins, ethanol. Althought ethanol is present throughout it is never overpowering, instead presenting a warm toasty slow burn, very easy to drink. Full of sweet chocolatey malt, figs, dark dried fruit. Finish is cocoa and espresso bitterness along with some ethanol. Towards the end of the bottle (from the last pour) get a lot of nutty yeastiness, hazelnuts. Coats the tongue like velvet. 
Could sip this one by the fire all night. I think that A is ruined for all future quads by this one. Much hype but definitely worth seeking out. 871 charactershtomsirveaux, Mar 09, 2009

4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It's great that finally I get the chance to try this legendary ale, on my birthday! The BB date of this bottle coincides with my birth-date, albeit in a different year of course: 07/03/10; served cool in a large tulip-shaped wine glass.
A: very dark brown with purple-ish hues, chunks of yeast sediments keep floating in the nectar due to the light fizziness in action, topped with a semi-dirty dark beige froth that settles slowly to a thin blanket to last.
S: intensely malty and estery, witnessing good work of the candy sugar and yeasts; the aroma is full of fat dessert dates, fig jam, sweetened berries/raisins, treacle, and surprisingly light honey-ish note, all elements are rolled into one integrated aroma on top of a rather refreshing touch of relatively light brown malts. Not a wee bit of alc. is detected on the nose, even after several serious swirls. Not terribly complex; or, the complexity reveals itself in the most subtle way.
T: an effortlessly enticing foretaste mixed of oily toffee, caramel, longan-fruit soup, raisins, and brown malts with a touch of toasted nuts comes in full swing, laced by sweetened roasted tea, roasted malts, honey-coated walnuts, then slowly transforming into an remarkably dry & spicy-estery aftertaste where a high level of bitterness of hops flows elegantly & freely vis-à-vis a generally herbally-spicy backbone. Here, my taste buds can still pick up lingering undertones of candy-sugary maltiness, albeit more in terms of aroma than taste; these mildly sweet elements seem to linger as a reminder of the body and depth of a giant malty brew.
M&D: the texture is blissful, incredibly satisfying and rounded, with utterly smooth carbonation to complement a full (but never thick) body... All in all, there's no drama here, no BIG flavours or overpowering elements to dominate the scene; only a brilliantly structured, evolving flavour profile proceeds from one stage to the other just seamlessly. I can't work out how dry and bitter it could smoothly transform into in the rounded finish given the oily malty foretaste, while consistently there's neither any trace of big alc. nor sticky sugary mouthfeel. This might have been the smoothest and harmonious Quadruple that I've had the luck to try - if it could be obtained at a much lower price (I was charged US$18 by the "Belgian Shop"!), I wish to sip one bottle of this ale a month, just to remind myself how blissful and tranquil the beer world can be, without much pretence and loudness. 2,496 characterswl0307, Mar 07, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I thought I'd save this brew for a milestone...my 600th review. Many thanks to organicbrewer for hooking me up. Brown 33cl. bottle with a date stamped on the cap: 09.05.10. Poured slowly into a Duvel tulip a very dark mahogany brown with a thick three-finger beige foamy cap. The head settled after fifteen minutes to a rocky, latte looking cream and chunky lace clinging to the glass. The damn thing looks like dessert.
Ripe fruity nose with note of plum, pear, cork, candi sugar and some fusels. Even when it warmed I wasn't getting much more out of the aroma, although it is complex as hell.
The taste outstanding with perfect balance. Sweet and malty upfront, complex and fruity with a unique spiciness to a nice bitter end. Ripened fruit that fluffs in the mouth, with plum, sultanas, grape, pear, molasses, candi sugar, yeast and a hop spicy bitterness. Best tasting Quad I've ever had.
Fluffy and smooth in the mouth with a bit of sting on the tongue from the perfect carbonation. Velvety and devine in the mouthfeel and taste. The alcohol is woven into the complexity which aids in giving this rather high ABV brew a super drinkability...I would love to be able to drink this stuff on a regular basis. It certainly does live up to the hype in my book.
Thanks again Josh for this tasty brew! 1,301 charactersscottoale, Mar 06, 2009

Pours a dark reddish brown with plenty of off-white head. 
Smell is very complex. I smell a soapy malt smell with dark red fruity undertones. Smell is defiantly subdued, but maybe appropriate for a quad.
Taste is amazing. The different malt characters are like no other beer I've tried. It has a great cinnamon-like spice malt flavor. The bitterness of the hop balance with the malts perfectly. 
Mouthfeel is medium with a light/medium carbonation - the ideal mouthfeel for a quad.
This beer is extremely drinkable. After I'm done I want another. Enough said. 
I have to say, the spicy malts of this beer are like no other I've tried. And it's not the spice flavor you find in some winter beers where you they just dumped a can of nutmeg, cinnamon and the like in a pot and called it a winter beer. 881 charactersBeerStine, Mar 06, 2009

4.27/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Via trade with MacDomer - many thanks! BBD is 12.02.11 (2/12/2011 for us Yanks). 33cl bottle into St. Bernie's chalice. Out of fridge for about 10-15 minutes and breathing a few more minutes before pouring. I wanted to let it breathe a bit longer but I pop the cap and it's happy to see me as it slowly froths above the top of the bottle so I pour a little bit into the chalice. The foam keeps coming so I get the rest in there.
The pour as mentioned is extremely well-carbonated and yields a slightly murky raisin brown. Active carbonation yields a 1/2-finger head in the chalice; it dissipates but leaves a wispy ginger-colored film resembling a solid Kosher rye.
Whoooaaa, camel...first impression is clove, ginger and rum raisin ice cream. The beautiful bride notices prunes and a bit of chocolate...she's spot on. Prunes definitely abound; there's a dark leather scent...even a bit of soapy plums. Very complex with a mild to moderate booziness that's carrying ginger notes and aided by the solid carbonation.
I'm getting a little bit of floral soapy notes at first, followed by mild gingerbread, a little clove and then some raisins. It's amazing what 5 more minutes of warmth does for this. The floral soap veneer thankfully burns away and we're back in solid Quad ground. The leathery fruitcake spices, the deep dark dried plums, dates and chocolate covered cherries bring this another level of complexity. Surprisingly austere on the finish...much more dry than expected. As the BB indicated earlier, mild baking/bittersweet chocolate emerges with warmth. Prunes, too. Still, a tad of lingering floral soapiness.
For some reason I expected a big mild spice and raisin bomb. I'm really surprised at the pleasant dryness of this offering. The construction is so well-done that there's not a lot of mess left behind. The excited carbonation may indicate that the yeast in this deal may have eaten everything they could wrap their cells around. Still, that floral soapiness still lingers.
Maybe it's the thought of enjoying this for the very first time but this dows go down very quickly. It definitely takes a while for that one off-flavor - the floral soap - to burn off its weirdness. Note no real mention of booziness on the taste or palate profile - after the initial rum raisin ice cream scent it simply isn't an issue. My guess is that I should probably invest in a case of this some day to evaluate over time because merely one bottle isn't enough. With many extreme offerings the flavors and notions are in your face so that there's no mistake. This treasure is definitely more subtle and takes a little more time to figure out. Great, complex construction. 2,676 charactersIBUnit63, Mar 02, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A special treat for my wife and I on our anniversary, as she is a huge Belgian fan. Pours a hazy deep brown color, with huge (2 finger), thick head that quickly evaporates into my goblet. Little darker than I expect from a quad. The smell was striking to me, and in a good way. It was nice mix of the sweetness of raisins and honey and an almost red wine alcohol smell. A very unique, and very enticing smell. The complex aroma is definitely a forebearer of the taste. A blend of a malty, sweet backbone, with spices, and that red wine character (I am not a huge wine advocate, so I cannot describe it any more specifically, and have never used a wine reference in a beer review, it just fits here). Medium carbonization and a medium density makes this rest nicely in the mouth, allowing you to enjoy all the complexities of the flavor. The ABV is also superbly masked by the complex flavor. Worthy of its lofty status indeed. 926 charactersbhalter8, Feb 25, 2009
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My 300th review! This is another live one. Of course I was waiting to try this one, the #1 rated beer here on BA. Purchased from BelgianBeerShop.com (not to be confused with Belgianshop.com) for something like 10 Euros, received about 6 weeks ago and waiting for this opportunity to sample. I also bought a Westvleteren glass and of course I poured it into a clean one.
A Pours a dark, dark brown, in front of direct light there is a ruby red outline, glow but the body remains very dark indeed. Nice, light brown frothy head which lingers, now for about 10 minutes as I am letting this one warm up to what I believe to be a more proper temperature. I opened it about 2 minutes after taking it out of my fridge where it has sat undisturbed for the past 2 weeks. Sediment is visible in the bottom of the glass but also sticking around in the body itself. Upon pouring it the last pour was a visibly viscous, yeasty appearance. The look cannot be improved upon, the quintessential Belgian Quad.
S A wonderful wine-like grape malt sweetness hits the nose at first. Repeated smelling revealed the same red wine (or maybe even concord grape!) sweetness presumably due to the malt but very little alcohol to the nose. This is a really inviting smell which just adds to my anticipation.
T Incredibly complex, deep tastes of grainy yeasty malt, no bitterness. Aftertaste of a light stickiness, but less than other beers that I have had. It is like a light syrup vs. a heavy syrupy stickiness. This might be the most well hidden alcohol in a beer that I have ever "not" tasted. Wow, all I taste are the grains, the malt. There is a hint of a burn of alcohol in the beginning of the taste but it is really hidden very well. As it warms (I am still sipping it from time to time) there is a great sweetness to be enjoyed, a return of the sweet concord grapes. Running throughout the taste spectrum and adding to the complexity is a nuttiness which is welcome. You know, it is sort of like all great beers combined, if I can hyperbole for a minute. In there you may taste the great Sam Smith Nut Brown Ale, St. Bernardus and others.
M Maybe the smoothest beer that I have tasted, it is like liquid bread. The head which stayed at least somewhat throughout the entire experience is made up of a very fine head which is related to the mouthfeel in that the carbonation makes the feel very smooth indeed. 
D I could drink this all day but if I did I would be broke and likely on the floor. Really though, it is difficult to get, expensive and has a high ABV but I savored every last drop (in fact my last sip was head which stayed all of the way through to the end). 
Notes: Well, there you have it. This is the highest rated beer in the world (at least here on BA and I believe other places too) and it is deserving of the honor. This, my friend, is the king of beers. 2,859 charactersadamette, Feb 23, 2009

First Westy!
A. Dark brown hazy leather. What can i say this brew is beautiful. Nice thick frothy head, receded to a delicate layer of foam. Unimaginable lacing on the glass.
S. Dark fruit notes up front. So complex I'm hit with a plethora of smells. Best i can describe is it smells like happiness.
T. Taste very similar to the smell. Hints of green apple. Warm belly glow.
M. Smooth and creamy. Hits and coats the tongue with a strong body that settles just right.
D. Great. I could drink this beer all night unfortunately I only have the 1 *sigh*. Is this the best beer in the world? I don't know, I haven't had them all yet but it is definitely the best damn beer I've ever had. 832 charactersChapter40z, Feb 22, 2009

A: Poured in to a Westvleteren goblet (yes, I bought one for the occasion, and it was worth it). It foamed up a bit when I opened it, but it wasn't a full-on gusher, could've just been a little shaken.
Poured a hazy medium leather brown with one finger of off-white to light tan head. It seemed to recede fairly quickly to a nice froth and thick lacing clings to the glass like soap suds.
S: Oh, oh my... Dark fruits like plum and raisin, hints of vanilla, caramel, butterscotch and some chocolate all come through on the nose. Smells sweet and extremely complex, there's also some scents in there that smell so familiar yet so hard to describe, like candy but I'm not sure what kind.
It smells extremely unique, unlike any other beer I've had placed in front of me, and I think those that have tried it know what I mean.
T: Dark fruits run the party. Plum, raisins, and a touch of red apple. Some brandy-like notes come along with the light touch of alcohol, and is completely complimentary to the overall balance. It has a very light sweetness that I find indescribable, along with a sprinkle of bitterness over the tongue in the finish that fades out beautifully and quickly. I've never had a beer with such a perfect finish. The only way I can describe the finish is that it's almost savory, like a perfectly seasoned broth.
M: This beer is sooo silky smooth. Lightly carbonated, but perfect. Tiny bubbles make this beer go down like a milkshake, super creamy and on the heavy end of medium bodied.
The mild hop bitterness in the finish rounds it out beautifully.
D: I could easily drink 10 of these based on flavor and smell alone. The alcohol is subdued enough that this is incredibly drinkable considering the 10.2%.
Whether or not you get smashed in the process, it's nearly impossible to not want another one after you've cracked the first.
Notes: This may not be the best beer on earth. This may not be worth ALL the hype, and this may not be everyones idea of perfection. However, this is the best beer that I, personally, have ever had. 
Will I seek this out within the United States again? Probably not.
Will I go way out of my way to buy 3 cases and get them home from Belgium one day? Damn right I will! 2,340 charactersTehAnkh, Feb 20, 2009

One of eight Quadrupels selected for a blind tasting on February 12, 2009. This came in second place for me personally, but it was phenomenal all the same. These are notes from the tasting.
Served in a chalice at cellar temperature.
Appearance- Deep chestnut brown, this gorgeous beer supports a fat, inch-thick mat which stays around for the entire event. Great lacing for a beer of 10.2%, a fantastic looking beer.
Smell- Aromas of rich, dark fruit like figs and dates fill the air. There is warm bread, along with a gentle sweetness that really beckons the first sip.
Taste- Enormously mouth-filling flavors of dark fruit, chocolate, and a hint of licorice... rich malt backbone and a fleeting hop bitterness right at the end. A stellar quad.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- In a word, sublime. The texture is pure velvet, bringing out all of the complex flavors as good as it possibly could get. This was tasted blind against seven other examples of this style, and it lives up to the incredibly high standards and expectations we've all heard about. I would seek this out again without question. 1,171 charactersyelterdow, Feb 15, 2009

Fortunately Im one of the lucky ones and this is not the first time I have drank this beer, it is the second. The first time I did not have time to review it.
Well here it is in front of me, the mother of all beers to say, the one that any beer enthuasist "HAS" to try. For me this is the real "King of all Beers" to try since my fav style is "Belgians". I need to mention this has been aged a while, the last one I drank was about 5 months ago.
So having a beer like this deserves its own proper glass. I poured this into my "Trappist Westvleteren" glass. It poured a nice caramel brown like color with a tannish/white two finger head. Leaves beautiful lacing throughout my glass.
Smells of dark brown warm bread that comes out of the oven, dark fruits, plums, raisins, mild hops, spicy alcohol. Very mouth watering.
Mildy fruity with hint of spices coming trough, biscuit like taste, figs, dark sugary chocolate. Very smooth and sticky.
Mouthfeel is very smooth and covers the whole palate full of flavors, very complex.
This is a very drinkable beer, hides the alcohol very well. Very tasty and surely one of the best beers I have tried, easy top 3. As for being the best beer in the world, I would say there are a couple better ones out there I tried. 1,288 characterstr4nc3d, Feb 15, 2009

Poured into a Westvleteren glass. What else would one use for this masterpiece?
I have to say. I was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to the hype, and the anticipation. I was not disappointed. Not in the least.
It pours a very rich, dark caramel-like color, with a minimal, but persistent head that remains at the edges, from start to finish. Very tight, crystalline lacing.
Wonderful aroma of candied fruits and warm bread. It is almost unbelievable how dampened the alcohol is here.
I'm not sure where to begin with flavors. This is really complex. Evolving heavily, as I finish it. At first, the sweetness is more than I expected. But, not overpowering. Lots of fig, and stone-fruit flavors. Honey-like sweetness. Bread pudding with raisins comes to mind. Toffee, caramel, and a mild-roast coffee.
The texture is soft and slightly sticky. The carbonation is elevated, but controlled. And, the alcohol is perfectly balanced and masked, as with most all Trappist work. It is still warming though.
This really is wonderful. I can't wait to have another. I only received 8 of these. So, I'm going to do my damnedest to cellar some. But, I have a feeling I will fail miserably. That's okay too. :P 1,238 charactersDigitalHype, Feb 14, 2009

A- A dark burnt caramel color with very little head. The lacing is kinda clinging to the edges of the glass. Some yeast floaties in the beer.
S- A very nutty bready smell with lots of yeast. Dark fruits, more along the lines of dates and figs. I'm also getting a chocolate smell as well. 
T- The taste is smooth, good chocolate taste, the figs and dates for sure are there. Bready, yeasty and hearty, yet smooth and very tasty. 
M- Very smooth, creamy and delicious.

4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer has a beautiful, dark chestnut brown color, showing hints of dark ruby at the edges when held up to light. It's capped by a 1/2" of dark tan, tightly bubbled head that slides down to a thin, persistent lace around the top. It looks absolutely gorgeous in the glass.
On the nose, the 12 shows vibrant, complex aromas of toffee, raisins, figs, clove, coffee, dark cherry and licorice. At about 55 degrees, the smells come bursting out of the glass. After a few sips and swirls, a sasparilla note, reminiscent of old fashioned root beer, becomes apparent.
The flavors follow through consistently with the nose, with additional notes of candied sugar and bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is full, creamy and very, very smooth. The alcohol level is quite well hidden but becomes much more evident as the beer warms up a touch. Throughout, though, there is the expected "warming sensation" you'd expect from a beer w/ this ABV.
The finish is long-lasting and very complex. There is a definite sweet cola aspect to the finish, along with more spicy clove notes.
On the whole, this is a magnificently made beer and understandably rated as such. For a true Belgian beer fan, this may be the end all/be all of beer. For someone, such as myself, who much prefers other styles of beer, this is appreciated for what is: a beer made with consummate skill, but to my taste, not the "greatest beer in the world." 1,414 charactersMattysox, Feb 07, 2009

Nothing says special like "holy shit, my cellar is almost empty." The only other time I've tasted this brew is when I was pretty blitzed at the barrel aged Speedway release, when I cracked a piss warm bottle in a drunken attempt to show off to my friends. Hey, nobody else was crackin a Westy. Bitches.
As for today, I pour a deep blood moon of burgandy with a beautiful head of tan bubbles.
Smells sweet. Malty. Caramelized sugar. Figs. Dark fruits, raisins. Alcohol. Cherry. Tons of shit. This puppy is busy as hell.
Taste unique as a mafucka. All of the above represented. Extremely complex. The alcohol that is a little over represented in the nose is not in the flavor profile at all.
Damn smooth. Hits the tongue, paratroops down the throat, and disappears Houdini style. Unique I say again.
Drinkability? Don't know. I could easily drink a few. The 10+% is very appreciated, meaning: daddy's happy!
When I first came on this site, Westy 12 immediately became my holy grail. I found it's not that difficult to get: just pay the man (read 20 bucks a pop on ebay). So it's not the best beer I've ever had, even though it is statistically the best beer on planet earth. Is it good? You betcher ass.

Appearance - 4.5
Poured a finger of beige head that quickly reduced to a thin layer. The body is completely opaque, black with reddish brown where the light hits it. Left little lacing.
Smell - 5.0
Not as powerful as some beers of this strength, but oh so pleasant. The sweet aroma includes golden syrup, toffee, cocoa, raisins, stewed apple and a little spice.
Taste - 5.0
What does one expect when drinking the world's greatest beer? It doesn't blow my head off, and it isn't outrageously complex, but it does taste damn good. Alcohol is smooth and warming, and it is much sweeter than the other Westvleterens. Flavours of caramel, stewed red apple, burnt sugar, mixed spice and cocoa. The finish is pleasantly bitter (although not quite enough to call it perfectly balanced) and slightly dry.
Mouthfeel - 4.5
Amazingly smooth, fine carbonation, although perhaps a little flatter than desirable.
Drinkability - 4.5
Very easy to drink for one so strong, but the sweetness meant that I was not longing for a second (but I had one anyway!).
OVERALL
Alright, let's get the obvious questions out of the way:
Q. Is Westvleteren 12 the perfect beer?
A. No. If it were perfect I would have scored it a 5. To me it has one definite flaw, and a couple of minor flaws. First, it is definitely too sweet. Deliciously sweet I might add, but ultimately it is a beer that is best suited to drinking one on its own, or serving with dessert. As mentioned, the beer is also a little flatter that I would like, but for the style this is acceptable.
Q. Is Westvleteren 12 the best beer in the world?
A. Possibly, although my gut feeling is that there are probably a couple of beers in the American micro brewing scene that are better.
Q. Is it the best beer I have tried?
A. Yes. Not by a huge margin mind you, but no beer I have tasted before has had quite the wow factor, or delicious richness of flavour that the Westy has.
Q. If I have one bottle of Westvleteren 12, should I drink it now or let it age for a few years?
A. Either. I have now tried the beer both fresh, and after 5 years in the Kulminator cellar. Overall I would say the cellared version was the more complex, better tasting beer, but it had lost much of its carbonation. Whichever way you choose to drink it, it is a fantastic beer. 2,328 charactersLittleCreature, Jan 29, 2009

A: Poured into a tulip and shared with a couple select friends. Dark dark chestnut with a 3 finger off white head. Very slow dissipation. Slow and steady release of carbonation adds to the head nearly as fast as it settles. Wonderful, thick lacing. Physical foam more than superficial detritus. 
A: warm dark fruit aromas with a slight ester funk. Powerful and steady without being overwhelming. 
T: First impression is the ridiculous smoothness of flavor. For the style the maltiness and yeast sharpness are perfect. The esters dance on the tongue and there is absolutely no indication of the alcohol content. Buttery, oakey finish. 
M: Rounded and perfectly effervescent on the palate.
D: This beer was worth the wait. I certainly do wish access was better and easier, and that ease of procurement wouldn't take anything away from the beer. It does live up to the hype. 980 charactersPamola, Jan 26, 2009

Thanks to Vickie (LifeIsGood) for providing me with this opportunity. 
Pours a deep brown color with a decent looking tan head that leaves considerable lacing. Again, this is a small serving so I'm sure this would be all the more amazing if I was working with a full bottle. 
Smells of sweet brown sugar, dark fruit, slightly alcoholic (though not as strong as ABV may indicate) with some bready notes, a little nutty and some chocolate in the background. Truly an amazing work of art going on here.
Taste is stongly reminiscent of dark fruits (fig, raisin) with notes of caramel and chocolate present throughout. Subtle sweetness that lingers.
Nice mouthfeel, very smooth with medium carbonation. The feeling as it glides across the palate is almost indescribable. A true sipper that I would love to savor throughout the night if only I could obtain a decent amount worth of it. Now all I have to do is make a trip to Belgium so I can (hopefully) obtain a full case worth for about 40 bucks. Trying this should be a goal of any BA and I am just glad I was able to fulfill it, even to this small extent, so early in my journey. 1,288 charactersVengeance526, Jan 25, 2009

The first aroma hits me as a big fruitiness, Belgian yeast, nuttiness, caramel/toffee, bready malt, big booze. Cant wait anymore, must sample.
The taste. The taste. Hmm. How do you describe awesome? Big caramel malt sweetness, melted toffee, fruity candy like goodness, big warming boozy rush with each sip, an herbal character as well. Trust me these words do not do the taste justice.
Velvet like, smooooth, warming, moderate carbonation, full bodied. 
This is a gigantic almost 11% quad, so a bottle was enough. Okay, I could have another. But this is no session beer. Definition of a sipper.

With a little age, even more light is shed on the absolute perfection in the way the wondrous flavors of this beer of gods blend together in creating a taste of the heavens.
Pours a murky, alive, dark chocolate malt brown with a fluffy, cloudy, pillowy extremely light tan head that sits on top of this wonder as a heavenly cloud sits above the wonders of life below. Close your eyes and inhale the deep, succulent, full, chocolaty, creamy, soul of bread aroma and you can feel the beers aura inviting you to taste it's otherworldly pleasure.
The feeling as it flows through your mouth and makes contact with the taste buds, immaculate. This beer is alive! As you become one with its glory you not only taste, but feel the incredible deep full roasted blend of complex bready chocolate sweet dried fruit goodness that balance in creating the ultimate beer flavor.
This beer is unlike any other that I have experienced. It has the incredible balance and smoothness that makes the Rochefort 10 so special, but it's flavor - complexity similar to the Bernardus Abt, but blends and is alive in a way which can't be done justice through comparison. The individual aspects of this beer are reminiscent of those that make other great beers exactly that, but the way in which they all come together in a harmonious revelation is what ultimately makes this beer unmatched.
All hail the king in his golden crown. 1,532 characterstconboy, Jan 21, 2009

Poured a mahogany/cola color - some light penetration with ruby red highlight around the edges and tiny particles visible in solution. Incredible head retention unlike any brew I've ever had, with thick sheets of sticky lacing evident throughout the tasting. Nose was wine-like with some woody characteristics, spices and cherry-flavored cough medicine. Taste follows nose with a dry, oaky and spicy finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied with a tingly effervescence from beginning to end. Hands down the best Quad I've ever had. So smooth and easy drinking with an abv that's undetectable.

Hazy dark brown with minimal head, but expected with such high alcohol content. some lacing on the side, but the beer is several years old as well. some yeast or proteins floating around on the bottom of the glass.
Smell is brown sugar, with notes of apple and pear. almost has the smell of a hard cider. Maybe a hint of oxidation in the nose. Very reminiscent of a barleywine.
Wow, taste is really quite layered with so many different flavors going on. Alcohol only hits the back of the throat towards the finish. Notes of apple, pear. Brown sugar taste is there too. Maybe even a taste of lemon. and some notes of bread. 
mouthfeel is really there too. a gentle creaminess with adequate carbonation. 
Overall a great beer, however with that being said i think rochefort 10 and st bernardus are definitely its equal. i might even have to rate the rochefort 10 higher than it. perhaps there is even a bit of disappointment for holding and coveting the beer so long, that it can never reach the expectations that you have set for it. 1,182 charactersjpaltan, Jan 11, 2009

I poured about 60% of the bottle into my snifter glass watching to leave the sediment in the bottom of the glass. About a finger of foamy off white head formed and then slowly receded into the brew... The beer was a deep dark ruby red/amber color... Held to the light you can see the clarity is very nice. It's just very dark so it appears more opaque. Not a classic lacing, but on the side of the snifter where I am drinking from is covered with clinging foam that stays put between sips... Perhaps as I make my way through the glass further I will see more.
The aroma is very deep and very inviting. Dark fruits, cherries, dates, tobacco and some real earthiness. 
The flavor is really smooth... I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this is very nice. It's interesting in that it's fairly complex, yet also pretty consistent front to back.. Dark dates nice sweetness then to some deep malt flavors. No harsh grain nature.. just a smooth malt flavor... some subtle bitterness in the background that I believe is hiding the alcohol notes. If you really concentrate, they are there... but barely noticeable.
Silky smooth with the slightest tingle of carbonation. I literally grabbed this from my aging cellar and 52-55 degrees was perfect for this.
Really is supremely drinkable. There is the slightest presence of alcohol, but overall it's such a well hidden 10% it's almost scary.
I am honored to have tried this gem.. It won't rank as my favorite beer, but I can certainly see why it's so well respected... 1,648 charactersReagan1984, Jan 10, 2009

Pours a deep transparent brown with a moderately sized head. Lacing stays tight as the head falls, but it doesn't last terribly long. Looks very good.
Aroma is very nice. Dust, dark rum, sweet malt, bread, yeast, faint hops, and a bit of alcohol. It really smells like fresh baked bread. The slight alcohol aroma really adds to what else is present, and the beer wouldn't be the same without it. Slightly vinous.
Taste is wonderfully complex and evolves nicely. Brown sugar, sweet caramel, the perfect amount of balancing bitterness, and a long, long finish. Flavors change, and overall palate impression shifts back and forth between bitter hops and sweet malt, especially in the finish. Too complex to describe. Delicious. What all quads should strive for. Perfect level of sweetness and bitterness.
Mouthfeel is just perfect. Full, fat, and round, but elegant at the same time. Not overly thick or syrupy. Wine-like. Hard to explain. Carbonation is just right. Again, what all quads should strive for.
Even with all of its power, drinkability is great. I could sip on this all night... and day. I liked it a bit warmer than most quads, or about 60F.
Overall, yes, one of the best beers I have ever had. In a league of its own? No. Just damn good.
I'm very glad I had the chance to try this, and will jump on the opportunity if I have it again. Worth the trade and then some. 1,438 charactersjjazz, Jan 09, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Entry 1/8/09: So this is what good beer tastes like. The date is a little confusing. Does any one know what 24.09.11 denotes? I have two more bottles, should I let these sit around a lot longer?
Also, I had it at room temperature (approx. 72F) then put it in the fridge a few days ago. I let it sit out for about 10 minutes before I opened it. Did I ruin anything in this process?
A- I poured it into a pint glass. The color is an awesome light but murky brown. Very thin head that remained throughout, and some lacing.
S- Sweet and hoppy.
T- Like it smells. A little too strong for my tastebuds, bud I can definitely get used to it.
 The high ABV probably takes some getting used to.
M- A little dry, but again, I can get used to it.
O- I'm really looking forward to the other two. One is enough for now.
Entry 12/21/09: This is bottle two of three that my wife got for me last Christmas. The date on the cap reads, "24.09.11". I stored this in my pantry for the last year, and placed it in a cooler set at about 45 degrees for a couple of days. Poured into a tulip glass.
A= Once opened, the contents fizzed out. This caused the sediment to swirl throughout the glass as I poured it as quickly as possible. It looked as thick and chewy as was perceived in the mouthfeel.
S= Honey and raisin bread
T= Very balanced watery sweetness, hop tartness, and alcohol hotness. 
M= Medium-heavy viscosity. Smooth aftertaste.
D= I wish I could say, "Keep 'em coming!", but at $20 a bottle I gotta save bottle number three. 1,523 charactersnycwinter, Jan 08, 2009
4.52/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This beer pours a dark brown with a slight white head with some lacing. The smell is of raisins, nuts and chocoalte. The taste has lots of raisin flavors along with a nice chololate malt flavor. This beer is very full of flavor, there is also a nice flavor of the yeast that blends very nicely with the big malt flavor. The mouthfeel is nice, but the carbonation level seems low. For a +10% abv beer this is incredibly drinkable. 429 charactersBiggness, Jan 07, 2009

Thanks to xpimptastikx for trading this to me.
Side by side with MiguelMandingo. Mine was 9 months old his was 3 years old.
For the longest time I figured this was just going to be a another over hyped beer that when I finally got to have it I would just be like meh. I will honestly say this has to be pretty much the best beer I have ever had and I would love to get more of it.
A - Very dark brown body with one finger of slightly off white head that leaves good lacing.
S - Raisins and toffee with some awesome floral notes, lots of lavender and some apple as well. Very solid and pleasant smell.
T - Just like the nose a solid mixture of raisins, toffee, lavender, apple, and other generic floral notes. Pick up a little bit of booze in the taste but nothing to bring down the taste just it can be noticed. Leather and tobacco notes in the back as well.
M - Silky smooth and creamy. Excellent medium body with the perfect mixture of medium carbonation. A beer has never felt so good in my mouth.
D - Easy to drink and super enjoyable. Even with the high ABV I would totally try to session this. 1,120 charactersmidaszero, Jan 07, 2009

A - Split the bottle into two servings. Poured into chimay goblets. Very hazy, dark copper. Light tan headed retained well but not as thick as expected for style. Possibly due to splitting among two servings.
Smell - Very evident bread smell, like a fresh cooked raisin bread. There is a subdued alcohol smell. And then into fruits raisin and plum, very sweet fruit. 
T - Perfection. It is so well balanced, one note blends into the next, I cant describe whats happening. It starts off with a bread pudding, then into sweet plum notes finishing off with just a hit of hops leaving me in a state of nirvana
M - Deceptive. I feel Like I could inhale the entire glass. But there is a full body and lots of carbonation.
O - Perfection. This is the most complex beer yet so perfectly balanced. The malt and hops are transformed into something completely unworldly.
I can now die a happy man. 1,007 charactersDwnTwnBwn, Jan 05, 2009

Beer poured a dark toffee color with a thick foamy head. It smelled of caramel, malt and flowers. I was a bit surprised by the complexity of the taste; I know that I cannot do it justice: very strong caramel and malt flavours, with a striking tone of ethanol. It had a flavor of dark bread and a light sweetness to it, but was not sticky. Very well done. 504 charactersAtricapilla, Jan 05, 2009

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I got a 6 pack with 2 bottles of blonde, 8, and 12. When I final got it my expectations were unreasonably high. I tried a bottle of the blonde then the 8 and both beers were wonderful but did not meet my expectations. Then I tried the 12 and it was fantastic and made the whole pain in the ass of get it worth while. It is rich, very sweet, lightly carbonated and has a slightly thick mouth feel. I wish that it had a little more of a head and that they only used there nondescript bottles, the ones without the ring of glass that says trappist on it, but at the end of the day those are the only negative thing I can say about this beer. 638 charactersIDrinkAllot, Jan 04, 2009

I tried to keep an open mind and not get sucked into the previous hype about this beer, but was it ever justified. Poured dark and thick with an off white head in a Westy glass. Carbonation reminded me of the pricklyness of a Westmalle and the taste was roasted and sugary. What an incredible, complex beer. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. 463 charactersphirleh, Jan 02, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to ThomasHardy for the hookup on this world class beer!
A - Split the bottle into two servings. Poured into chimay goblets. Very hazy, dark copper. Light tan headed retained well but not as thick as expected for style. Possibly due to splitting among two servings. 
S - Heavy yeast aromas (bready), spicy phenols, alcohols, dark cherry, dark chocolate, plum. Hops are insignificant. 
T - Bready flavors carrying through prominently. Medium-dry finish, very low level of bitterness. Minimal hop flavor. Rich and malty. Light notes of fruit - cherry/fig. Complex and rich. Delicious. 
M - Medium-light bodied, well carbonated. Very smooth and deceptively light for strength.
D - Wow. The complexity of the malt and yeast character is unique and rich. The BJCP describes this style as "smooth and dangerous" and I'd have to agree. Deceptively easy to drink for 10.2% ABV. Makes me wish I were a monk. Almost... 919 charactersBrewerB, Jan 02, 2009
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Same procedure as the 8, a 330ml bottle at cellar temperature split between Westvleteren chalice glasses. The date printed clearly on the bottle is 13.08.11, which corresponds to a dramatic pickup on one of my last visits to Belgium. Being only 4 months old, I'll call this one relatively fresh. 
5. A more vigorous head builds upon pouring - about 2.5cm after pouring half a bottle. The head is slightly more tan than the 8. The beer color is also darker brown, but with caramel-amber notes around the edges.
5. The smell is dramatically different than the 8. Much, much more rich fruity aromas with caramel undertones. I also get some cherries and pears. Amazing.
5. Wow - the debate is settled. They are different beers, but fresh Westvleteren 12 is better and much more complex than 2 year old Westvleteren 8. There is so much going on here, much of which I doubt I can identify. Again, figs and raisins; caramel and dark sugars. A hint of chocolate in the finish. Much more hops than in the 8 with a flowery sweet profile. The bitterness is there in the perfect amount to balance the powerful malts. The finish also carries yeasty notes that are hard to name with everything else that's going on. The flavor lasts for about 20-30 minutes after the last sip.
5. Very smooth and silky feel. The carbonation is incredibly soft, but present. My wife calls is velvety. This is a pinnacle and makes all other 5's I've given seem like 4.5's for the moment. There is an alcohol warmth on the palate which the breath carries if it's been a while since the last sip, but this is dominated with the complex flavors.
5. This beer is even easier to drink than the 8. I've sat at In de Vrede for hours enjoying this brew, entirely paralyzed from ordering the blond or the 8.
So, if the 8 is incredible, it's tough to conjure a a word for this beer. Definitely the best beer I've ever had. I wanted it to be hype the first time I went, but this beer has a way of surprising me with how good it is every time I drink it. One of the most transcendent of man's concoctions. 2,066 charactersjpiper, Jan 02, 2009

The smell is brown sugar, similar to candy. The flavor matches this except that there is notable hop. Not surprisingly, very strong warm alcohol flavor and feel. This is a thick beer with a low level of carbonation. 422 characterssmcolw, Jan 01, 2009
4.95/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5333 mL bottle, 19.09.10 date on cap
A: Pours a deep dark brownish almost purpled hued under a medium sized slightly off white head. Good retention and lace.
S: Instantly you are hit with a candied dark fruit, very sweet, vinous. Maybe a hint of toasted malt. Cherries, grapes, plums, ever so slight hint of chocolate and booze. Excellent.
T: Taste doesn't disappoint. Fruit is there again, bit of toasted malt, booze is present and a certain spice note. Sweet up front with very little bitterness in the finish. Chewy malt present up front as well. Slight nuttiness and maybe some chocolate in the end, too. Again, excellent.
M/D: Full bodied, but not too heavy. Carbonation is a bit prickly and this is really the only negative of the beer for me. Drinkability is excellent even for a big quad. Absolutely worth every ounce of praise that has been heaped upon it. Excellent beer. 884 charactersNCSUdo, Jan 01, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ahh Westy 12, the holy grail of beers.
I was fortunate to have one of my new hires from Belgium bring me one of these back, I've been holding onto it for roughly almost 2 years. The date on the top of the cap says, 30.08.09
The beers pours beautifully with a steady viscosity. Deep murky walnut brown body gleams magnificently in the sunlight. Millions of gorgeous streams of carbonation flow effortlessly towards the top of the glass. Creating a spectacular head with incredible retention.
The aroma has a very assuring quality about it. Toffee sweetness, fringes of dark chocolate, roasted walnuts, pepper, caramel, dates, plums, tobacco and grapes. Strong and complex.
The complexity is mind blowing, layer upon layer of flavors working in sync with perfect harmony and balance. Right away you get blown away with a nice pleasant sweetness - succulent grapes, loads of anise, honey, raisins, plums, dates, fig, tobacco leaf, clove, toasted toffee, dextrin sweetness, carmalized sugar, rum, and black pepper.The dark fruits sweep the palate into utter bliss. Incredibly long lasting residual sugars/phenolics, that start out strong and gradually increase in intensity and tone down slowly. Full-bodied, with a drying and highly carbonated mouthfeel.
Well, what can I say? This is definitely a magical beer, the pure intensity and complexity of the flavors is insane. Best beer in the world? Maybe. One of the best in the world? Yes. 1,438 charactersHoustonTX, Dec 31, 2008

4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a barely translucent dark brown color with reddish hues and a full finger loose foamy light cream tan colored head that fades slowly. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing in its wake. The smell is really nice...aggressive, earthy yeast, caramel, malty sweet and bready with a significant bourbon cherry vanilla tang. Light-Medium body and creamy, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated. Full flavored, the earthen caramel malt taste is livened up by a solid warming character with spicy side tones. I'm surprised at the significant presence of 10.2% ABV. I haven't experienced this much warming, in the chest, from a beverage in quite some time. It is a 'Quad' after all! Merry Christmas.
03.24.09 Second sample. Oddly enough...this experience has been significantly different from the first. The heat that i experienced the first time just wasn't there.

Cap dated 19.09.10
A: Pours a deep, dark, and opaque cola-brown color with a luxuriously creamy light-tan head that retains forever and leaves sticky drapes of lace coating the inside of the glass.
S: Incredible aromas of caramel, raisin, dark chocolate, plum, grape, toffee, roasted nuts, and further complexities offered up by a fantastic pinch of booziness that develops in the nose.
T: HUGE flavors of caramel and/or molassas, dark chocolate, alcohol, rum raisin bread pudding, tootsie-roll, sweet over-ripe dark fruit, and a faint lemon/orange citrus flavor in the finish.
M: Smooth, creamy, very silk-like. Glides over the tongue and down the throat with nary a problem. A bit of pepper (From the booze? Or the hops?) adds a whole different dimension to this.
D: This absolutely lives up to the hype. It went down so smooth and easy it was scary! Wonderful. 1,062 charactersGbVDave, Dec 25, 2008

11.2 oz bottle, yellow cap with best by date of 5/25/09, poured into snifter.
A: Pours a dark chestnut brown, yeast going into glass is obvious,but expected.Thin off white head, recedes quickly.
S: Very complex, nutty, bready, dark fruits (plum, red grape, raisin). Yeast contributes a spiciness to the the aroma as well.
T: Sweet maltiness, bready, caramel overtones, accompanied by dark fruit. Not as phenolic as I would have expected. Very little alcohol evident given it's strength. All this comes together like no other brew I've ever experieced. 
M: Low carbonation but works in favor of this beer. Slightly viscous with a medium-full mouthfeel.
D: Dangerously drinkable even @ 10.2%. Not sure when I'll get another of this fantastic beer but hopefully sooner than later. 835 charactersRiggsy, Dec 25, 2008

I get to try this heavy hitter of Belgian brew courtesy of BitterBill, thanks a lot Bill! Westy twelve fills up my goblet to the halfway point with a murky rusty red liquid that has some viscosity and borders on the darkest of browns. I poured hard but could only conjure up a half finger beige head that quickly swirled to a small island of foam and a short collar. Surprisingly this small collar leaves behind some nice lacework down the glass. 
The nose has a lot of depth and a solid amount of booziness. There's a ton of fruit jumping from the glass each time I stick my beak in there. Dates, plums, prune all come to mind along with brandy macerated raisins. There's even a spicy apricot flavor that I didn't at all expect. Musty, somewhat earthy notes lie deep in the background along with mild freshly baked pumpernickel bread. I'm really getting into the smell of this beer. The longer I smell the more I like.
This big quad seems to come across the palate a little muddled when compared to the nose but is still very good. Prunes and the brandy macerated raisins are the main culprits on the tongue with the figs and dates bringing up the rear. Bready notes litter the background and the spicy, musty yeast adds a nice touch of depth. There's a little too much alcohol on the swallow that seems to push some of the other flavors aside. I'm being picky with this brew, I know, but it really is very good.
I wasn't so sure of the mouthfeel of this beer when I first started drinking it. The body seemed a little on the thin side and the carbonation didn't have that snap that brings the frothy finish like others of the style. As this beer breathes the body falls nicely into place with a medium-full body and a slight stick. The alcohol fumes rise through the throat nicely.
As big as this beer is it goes down easily and is a joy at every sip. The lighter than expected body keeps this beer flowing without a problem.
This is a damn fine beer and one I would love to have more bottles of. I believe I enjoy St. Bernardus' version more so but this is the highest of quality. Thanks again for the treat Bill! 2,134 charactersjoe1510, Dec 24, 2008

Pours like a nice, smooth, creamy Belgian. Leaves a moderate quarter inch rather fizzy head. Retains pretty well. A dark brown, cloudy and well carbonated appearance. Some lacing.
Smells of creamy, sweet candied figs and dark fruits. Yummy!
Taste is very alive and intriguing. Candied dark fruits. Some breadiness to it, but not too yeasty. Pretty good.
Mouthfeel is everthing I expected in a great Belgian; silky smooth, moderate carbonation and easy to drink.
A great beer, but a bit overrated in my opinion. 585 charactersibbjamin, Dec 23, 2008

hazy auburn brown pour with a monstrous tan head. cinnamon cream colored yeast hits last and creates little designs in the fluff.
very vinous aroma changes every time i go back for another sniff... white wine, brown sugar, milk chocolate, malt powder and vanilla all show up. 
the palate is quite spicy and has a ton of yeasty bitterness... earthy, woody, real maple syrup, concentrated malt powder and lots of chocolate chip cookie dough flavors. pleasant perfume before the dry spicy finish. it's only mildly sweet though dry at the same time. medium body seems a bit thin considering how much is going on, the abv% and how NOT sweet it is. creamy texture is rich in the mouth but not heavy.
i really enjoy the balance, alcohol and complexity yet the sugar level is kept low making it crazy easy to drink and enjoy. sure it smells alright and tastes ok... but it's the whole package that makes it great!

A - pours a purple thick cloudy dark color. Nice white head after the pour, as well as being retained nicely. Holding it up to the light, the color looks magnificent.
S - very sweet, almost like fresh sweet raisins. Smell is in no way overpowering, and smells of the most fresh ingredients.
T - very sweet, small bitter bite, and the sweet sweet taste of fresh raisins. The sweetness of this beer is beyond belief. For a 10.2% alcohol, the sweetness is definitely the front line taste, followed by brief bitterness and a hint of alcohol.
M - very well carbonated, the taste is able to move freely throughout the mouth. Not very creamy, and for a good reason. This beer is all about a smooth carbonation that leaves a small aftertaste that makes you wanting more.
D - here is where it loses some points. The small aftertaste of the alcohol makes this one less drinkable than other brews. This is drinkable, yes, just not the most drinkable beer I have had. The small alcohol bite at the end is the most unappealing aspect of an almost perfect beer. 1,087 charactersabecall98, Dec 20, 2008
4.59/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #500. Received from Raznug for as a BA Secret Santa Gift! Thought it would be appropriate to review the #1 rated beer in the world with this landmark review. Poured into my Chimay Chalice.
A- Body is a very hazy dark brown color. Pours with a minimally creamy off white head. Head subsides to a thick half-moon collar with no collar around half of it and an eggshell creamy remnants of the head in the center. When held up to the light one can see the thick, dynamic cloudiness of this brew.
S- The overall impression of the nose is slightly sweet. Raisins, figs, root beer, cola, grapes, plums are mostly upfront and have a background of slightly spicy Belgian yeast and a very subtle, sneaky alcohol background.
T-The initial flavors are exquisite and balanced. A perfect bland of spicy Belgian yeast, fig, malt, and and dark fruits such as sweet raisins and slightly tart plum mix perfectly and give off a root beer and cola-like flavor. The spicy yeast comes through a little more for the finish as well as a slight bitter alcohol bite. The flavor then turns around and ends with a sweet fruity note. A slight essence of spicy Belgian yeast lingers. Flavor is wonderful and complex. 
M-Medium carbonation and wonderfully smooth and creamy body. Yeasty and smooth but with a touch of alcohol astringency.
D-This is a wonderful quadruple and it was truly and honor to try it. As far as pure drinkability is concerned; it is definitely a slow sipper. This, and other good examples of the style, IMO,are meant to be slipped slowly as you contemplate the complexity of what was produced. The ABV is quite noticeable and if you don't take your time with this brew you surely won't get a chance to appreciate it. Due to its $ and availability, its a beer that was definitely worth it for the first try/review but I will reserve obtaining it again for a VERY special occasion. A bit overrated (Its hard to be a perfect beer across the board)-but still an excellent, stand-out, well put together brew. 2,008 charactersPittBeerGirl, Dec 16, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I found this beer for sale at O'Brien's, with a hefty price tag for a 12 oz. Still, it was cheaper than a ticket to Belgium and I wasn't about to pass up the top rated beer in the world. Pours murky brown with a big tan head that stays around for a while. Pleasantly sweet aroma of cherries, prunes, brown sugar, licorice, bread dough, oak, and yeast. Unbeleivably light mouthfeel. Its like the beer hovers on your tongue. Amazing taste. It mimics the aroma quite well, with an intriguing combination of tastes. I had the same problem as others: it was very, very difficult to pin down specific flavors. It was almost as if the beer was blending and mixing while in your mouth. Sweet, sour, spice, and fruit were in constant motion and made up a beer that is almost undescribably good. It was well worth its price. 814 charactersmagictrokini, Dec 16, 2008

It's so good that I promptly made a clone recipe and brewed up 20 gallons. It's the best beer I've ever made. And... And it only has hints of this in it. Man, this is good. Perfectly balanced between sweetness, fruitiness, bitterness. Like, what? When did Belgians get bitter? Anyway, wow. Golly.
And, ha, very little of any Belgian taste to it. Like... Like they didn't even use Belgian yeast or something. So, strange and interesting and magic - this is good. I'd drink it every day - only it's just not available. As it is, I drink my clone every day. Just cracked my second westy 12 and found so many more things I can change in mine - to try to bring it a little closer. Oh! Man is this stuff good!

In deed, it is... those monks are crazy... they just made the best beer i ever drink... 
dark like the night, smelly like a sweet, the mouthfeel is heavy but it's really drinkable without any doubts... And the taste... incredible... strong toffee, nice sweet bitterness, the alcool is present but it's taste is not too much present, so... it's well balanced for a (very) strong beer... 10.20% damn... those monks knows how life should be... maybe they found the best way to live a good life... 543 charactersgregmurer, Dec 10, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this at "In de Vrede" cafe near the Sint-Sixtus Abdij in Vleteren, Belgium, after taking a 2-hour train ride from Brussels to Ieper and biking for 20 km. 
Appearance: A gorgeous dark, syrupy brown with a thin head; served in a silver-rimmed Westvleteren goblet. 
Smell: Strong hints of chocolate, coffee, and overall sweetness. Also faint notes of dates and caramel. 
Taste: Incredibly complex. Fresh-made italian espresso, bitter chocolate (&gt;85% cacao), dates, raisins, figs, slight butterscotch, toffee candy sweetness pervade this extraordinary brew. The complexity masks its high alcohol content all too well. Goes down smooth and slightly sticky, leaving behind an almost oily film. The mouthfeel is like nothing else. 
Overall notes: This is by far the best beer I've ever tasted, and completely worth any pilgrimage to sample it. 847 charactersthekanna, Dec 08, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well, here we go. I got this in a trade with miketd. Thanks Mike! I have been wanting to have my own bottle of this for a long time. Wrote this review doing a slight side-by-side tasting with midaszero, his was brand new, and mine is 3 years old - I believe.
11.2 oz bottle into a snifter.
Date on the cap reads 13.09.08
Appearance - Pours a deep burgundy from the bottle. It is transparent on the verge of translucent. Brownish with garnet hues. It has great head retention. It produced a 1 finger head that slowly dissipated to a thick crown on the surface of the glass. It leaves moderate lacing behind on the glass.
Smell - The smell is amazing. There is a lot going on in this brew. I can smell sweet notes of chocolate, toffee, caramel and burnt sugar. There are dark fruit notes of fig, cherry, plum, raisin, along with hints of red apple. There is a hint of spice as well - ginger and cinnamon. There is a hint of booze that peaks through, but it is pretty well hidden for 10.2% ABV. Very floral and wispy - hints of cherry blossom and lavender.
Taste - The taste is pretty amazing too. It is extremely complex and deep. It is very similar to the smell. There are the same notes of chocolate, toffee, caramel and burnt sugar. The bready notes from the malt are much more prevalent in the flavor than they are in the scent. The dark fruit notes come through in a nice balance with the malt notes and candi sugar. Raisin, fig, and cherry are the primary fruit flavors that peak through, intermingling with the spice flavor of cinnamon. There is a very distant floral hop note that comes through at the end of the flavor, providing an extremely slight bitterness.
Mouthfeel - This mouthfeel is perfect. The brew is full bodied and sticky. It coats all of the mouth and stays there. There is a perfect level of carbonation here - just enough to cut through the body and keep the brew feeling interesting. Incredibly smooth, creamy and velvety. 
Drinkability - This beer is perfectly drinkable. I didn't want it to live up to the hype, but it did. It is a fantastic beer. I don't know if I could point at a beer and call it the best in the world, but this is one of the most well-crafted beers out there. Even at 10.2%ABV, I could session this beer. It would be a mainstay in my beer rotation if it didn't require giving up shares of my soul to acquire it. 2,366 charactersMiguelMandingo, Dec 05, 2008
4.31/5  rDev -6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 404.12.10 on the cap.
A- brownish, red highlights, very similar in appearance to the dubbel. The light tan head had very good retention, creamy.
S- Black currants dominated. Wasn't able to pick out a whole lot of other stuff here, other than the standard Belgian smell. This beer mainly just has a real fruity nose, didn't really notice a lot of alcohol.
T- Dark fruit, almost grape-ish like 8 but it's more muted in this. Malts that are only very slightly roasted appear to contribute to the malt base here. No real roastiness or anything but a darker sweet malt presence.
M/D- very smooth, not too heavy on the tongue... pretty spot on in terms of feeling great in the mouth.. I think that really adds to its enjoyability even though I don't think the flavors are mind blowing or anything.
Solid beer I thought, I really enjoyed this one. 844 charactersMiScusi, Dec 01, 2008

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5What can a mere mortal write in the presence of such greatness?
A: A cloudy brown, with yeasties floating all around. Big, luscious head, with a little chocolate swirl of brown at the end of the pour.
S: Brown sugar, raisins, citrus rind, fruitcake.
T: Chocolate, coffee, candied citrus, clove, brandy, nice sweetness balanced by the citrus esters and a little bitter hopiness. 
M: Luscious, creamy, coats the entire mouth with a glorious sweetness and a little hoppy/citrus aftertaste. 
D: The very definition of drinkability in moderation, as the alcohol comes through eventually. 
This may not always prevail as the greatest beer on earth, but it deserves a place in heaven. 683 charactersBeerenauslese, Nov 28, 2008

A= This ale poured a murky, dirty dishwater tan/brown color. With a gentle pour, the off-white head was about 3/4" and creamy looking. Some hit and miss lacing down the glass. 
S= Huge alcohol presence in the nose, but also some sweet malty and fruity notes in there too. Mild spice toward the end. 
T= Amazingly complex and tasty. Flavors were a balance of bready malt and dark fruits (figs, raisins, apples) as well as a spiciness (cinnamon, clove) that was pleasant and not overwhelming. Alcohol was present in the finish but not nearly as hot as I would have predicted from the aroma. 
MF= Medium bodied. Feel was soft despite the very active carbonation release. 
D= Definitely a world class ale, and deserved of its following. I have a hard time saying it is the best beer in the world, but certainly a great beer that I will drink any time I can. 992 charactersspointon, Nov 27, 2008

This beer was deliciously complex and balanced that I could not taste the 10.2% alcohol until I was working on a nice buzz. There is nothing I could say about this beer that has not been said before so all I want to add is, if you haven't had one get one. You won't be disappointed even if you pay $20 a bottle like I did.

4.64/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I want to preface this review by saying that my girlfriend picked this up for me having no idea what it was. Fortune smiled.
Pours a murky reddish-brown with a big off-white head. More carbonation than I would have expected. Yeast from the bottle leaves a dark red mark in the head and last throughout which is really cool looking. Substantial lacings.
A real satisfying port-like aroma, nothing like combining my two favourite tipples! Alcohol characterizes everything but it certainly isn't overbearing, comes across as wine-soaked fruit. I get cinnamon covered apples like a dark cider. Standard style notes like plum, raisins and dates. It's incredibly rounded.
Serious malt backbone. Thick, boozy brown raisin bread. A fruity combination of plums and dates and nice sweet berries makes this alot more balanced than alot of quads. Cloves but not overpowering. Likewise, generous hopping leaves a spicy finish resembling bitter cocoa. Alcohol is not strong at all, I'm actually kind of shocked, I was expecting a real burning beer, but it isn't.
Best to have it only very slightly chilled, otherwise the lively carbonation takes out a bit of the flavour. As it warms it smooths out quite a bit eventually becoming quite creamy. 
Certainly deserving of the hype. An excellent beer and probably my favourite of the quads. 1,327 charactersCanuckRover, Nov 23, 2008

4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my 500th review, I thought I would make it a special one. Poured this .33L brown bottle (with raised neck ring) into a Westmalle glass. Cap was dated 8.09.11. The body was hazy and a dull plum color. The creamy, irregular head had an iridescence in the light tan bubbles. Some foam remained throughout. 
Smell was of cola and light molasses. Stewed apples with a dash of cinnamon. 
Taste was raisins and apples. Mellowed to perfection, nicely balanced. Each element compliments the other, not negating one another. Distinct, rich maltiness is countered with a tangy long finish. Taste surpassed the aroma, which I don't experience often enough. 
Mouthfeel was zesty yet smooth. Very drinkable. Very well hidden alcohol. This is not one of my favorite styles but I would never pass the opportunity to enjoy one of these. 830 charactersCresant, Nov 21, 2008

Dating on the cap reads 2 11 11 which translates to a bottle on date of November 2, 2008.  This is a beer almost 6 years old.  Poured from a bottle into my St. Bernardus snifter.
A:  A deep murky dark brown color with tons of floaties and particles.  Loads of sentiment at the bottom of the bottle.  Glass lacing was ring like, but spotty.
S:  Wow, yeasty smell jumps out with huge dark fruits, grape, candy sweetness and a little bit of nuttyness.  
T:  Loads and loads of dark fruits and huge amount of concord grape.  Raisins, plum, prune, and loads of grape flavor.  A tad bit of woody nutty notes mix in.  Sweetness is candy like, but not overwhelming so and it actually mixes tremendously with the dark fruits.  I expected this beer to be much sweeter, especially with the age on it.  The finish keeps the dark fruits mixed with the sweetness to produce a lasting finish that just dazzles the mouth.  So very silky and smooth, tremendous.  I didn't get any oxidation flavors and it seems the beer really held up very well.   Alcohol was really well hidden also.
M:  Full, coating, sweet, but not too sweet, and alcohol that was well hidden. Carbonation was low, but worked well with the beer.
O:  This was a 6 year old beer that has aged just beautifully.  It seems all the flavors have just integrated together to create almost perfection.  I am just amazed at how well this has held up and there is no doubt the age has made the beer a work of art.
I was always skeptical of this beer being the "King of the Hill", but after having this bottle I can fully understand why and fully endorse it's Kingness.  Wow. 1,745 charactersKadonny, Nov 17, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle with date of 04/23/11 into a snifter. Thanks to ygtbsm94 for the trade.
Appears almost black in dim lighting but when held up to light it is clearly brownish mahogany. A bit cloudy from the sediment. One inch thick light tan head sinks to a centimeter thick skim and leaves a small amount of lacing.
Aroma has some sweet sugary notes with a nice dark fruitiness like figs and plums. There is also a light spicy character in there as well but it blends with the alcohol. A bit of caramel in the back as well and even a light earthy hop character.
Taste begins with some sugary sweetness before the figs and plum quickly blend in. A little caramel and toffee flavors and a bit of clovey phenols collide with a nice earthy hop flavor that lingers on into the finish with a light sweetness.
Mouthfeel is medium, with the perfect level of carbonation and a wonderful chewiness to it.
Though this is certainly a great beer, I would definitely not say that it's the best in the world. Personally, I prefer Rochefort 10 over this, and that one is incredibly easier to obtain. If this was as available as Rochefort I doubt that it would be rated as high as it is. It's just one of those beers you have to try though so if you can I would highly recommend trading for it. 1,297 charactersroadhouse, Nov 15, 2008

Took a while for this one show its colors. It was too cold coming out of the fridge & after a few sips I wondered what all the hype was about. After a bit of cradling, the beer really opened up. The standoff-ishness vanished, & the dark fruits, warm alcohol, & almost wine-like smell really came out.
Sweet without being cloying, & not overpowered with booze. I can't say this is the best beer I've ever had, but it's a damn good quadrupel, & better with every warmed up sip. I'll let the last one sit a bit before I pop it open. 737 charactersmaximum12, Nov 14, 2008

Big thanks to srandycarter for hooking me up with this one. Poured into chalice glass
A. Murky brownish red body with a creamy white two finger head that last a good while and leaves a nice lacing.
S. Fruity nose dominates. Plums, raisons, mostly. Sweet malts, caramel, and a yeasty smell lay subtle. Smells pretty damn good.
T. Phenomenal... Easy on the palate. Much like the smell, Dark fruits with sweet candy hints, a slight bready taste, and very subtle on the alcohol. Taste lives up to all this beer is hyped up to be.
M. this has got to be the perfect mouthfeel. not too thin or thick. creamy head even added points to this.
D. I could sip one of these all day. the 10.2% would catch up to you sooner or later. But at the same time, I'd only want one every once in a while so it wouldnt cheapen the experience.
wow. I'd love to put some age on a bottle and see how it develops. Wonderful beer. Thanks again for the hookup randy. 1,086 charactersEGledhill, Nov 06, 2008
4.43/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5BBD: 29.03.11
Bottled around March '08, guessing this based on the date printed on cap, three years from bottling date. Huge thanks to ygtbsm94 for this, a very generous trader. 
Auburn brown with orange edges, a creamy texture to the foam. Served in a Moinette chalice. In time the head fades to a ring at the edge. Spotty bits of lacing, looks every bit the trappist ale. Malty, peppery aroma.
Taste is where it really shines, a concentrated dose of phenolic clove, rich complex malts, tobacco, and a drying bitter hop note towards the end. The yeast gives some minor grape fruitiness, but it's not pronounced. Very light sweetness in the middle that flourishes just for second. Creamy and full bodied. Holding it on the palate, you notice a hint of the alcohol warmth, but not in the taste. Exceptional body and drinkability. One to sip and contemplate. 
It's hard to judge, while finely crafted, it's certainly not my personal favorite. Rochefort 10 has surpassed this at times, and other bottles fall short. One to savor and recognize as a benchmark Quadrupel. 1,068 charactersemerge077, Nov 06, 2008

I can't say whether this lives up to the #1 beer in the world hype - though i can say this, along with the Rochefort 10 are the best belgian quads that I have tried. 
This beer stands out as unique among all the other trappist beers and other Belgian 10s and 12s, as it stands out among all brews in the world. 
It is incredibly drinkable, caramely yet not sweet...this is the most drinkable 10+% alcohol beer I have ever had. 
I had to search far and wide (even in Brugges) to find this beer, and Im glad I did! Drank a bottle at an amazing pub there and brought a couple home. 779 charactersbenclimbs, Nov 06, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance - Dark reddish-brown, with some sediment. Poured with a very small head in a goblet, although this is no doubt due to poor handling when transported overseas, as I know this beer is supposed to have a large head.
Smell - While still fairly cold, this beer has a strong, sweet and fruity odour, nothing too special. As it warms, it acquires an amazing, very complex biscuity, fruity and spicy odour. I had to give this a five, because I couldn't imagine a beer smelling any better.
Taste - I ensured I did not have any preconceived notions as to what this beer would taste like before trying it. However, even though I poured it slightly too cold, I was hooked from the first taste. This beer has a perfect balance of dark fruits, cinnamon-like spices and sweetness. The alcohol is slightly noticeable, but is nothing to complain about. The flavour develops slightly with warming, but actually seems to weaken a fair bit if it is too warm. My first 5/5 for taste has most certainly not gone undeserved. 
Mouthfeel - Amazingly light and smooth, not too sticky like some other Belgian ales.
Drinkability - I could totally see myself sessioning this. No, really.
Overall - My brother got this beer delivered for my 21st birthday (and I know he'll read this review, so thanks again!). However, I had many fears that what I had received would not live up to its reputation. I had heard stories about Westvleterens supposedly deteriorating significantly when transported overseas. Also, the fact that one of the beers I received was not in the usual Westvleteren bottle sparked fears that I may have received a cheap, recapped ripoff. However, the first taste assured me that this was the real deal. Though I have given this a much higher score than any other beer, I do not feel that I have been generous in any way with my scoring. 1,842 charactersCs1987, Nov 01, 2008
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer has a sterling reputation, which I assumed was unearned. It's not. Granted much of its cache is due to its scarcity, but that doesn't change the fact that it is world-class.
Body was a dark red-brown with creamy white head with great staying power. Aroma was earthy, raisin-y, and distinctly cereal-y, but in a good way. The cereal-y of this and the other Westvleteren beers I tried had this underlying aroma that reminded me of the boiling mash smell that permeates the brewery when a boil is going on. Flavor is a bit like baking bread (that same malt-mash flavor) with raisins and a touch of sweetness and a noticeable alcohol tinge. Very balanced. At the top of the page, my notes say "Honestly, this is perfect."
I can't recommend this beer enough. I had it at the Cafe In De Vrede, across the street from the St. Sixtus abbey that brews the beer in Westvleteren. Awesome. 889 charactersBeerBelcher, Oct 24, 2008
4.89/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Ruby brown in color with shades of rust and copper. Medium head but not near the retention of some in its class. It's still falls slowly to a ring, leaving random lacing down the glass. Smell is amazing. Not as big and rich in the malt department. It makes you anticipate a slightly less full body compared to others. Great scent of fruits. Some grape, raisin, plum, pear, and fig. More fruity than anything. Still a good touch of candy(i) sugar and light yeast. Leather. Some caramel is evident also. Taste is just as amazing. Good fruit flavors again, not too thick from caramel and the like. Candy sugar and a lightly toasted bready yeast. Also some subtle bubble gum flavor. A delicate touch of spice and candy sugar. Mouthfeel isn't as velvety as possible but very nice. More on the medium bodied side with a bit of spice. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in this brew. It's a pleasure to sip on, if possible. So full of flavor and complexity that it's tough to beat. Unbelievably drinkable for what it is. 1,007 charactersncvbc, Oct 21, 2008
4.69/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into my quad goblet. Pours a cloudy, dark reddish-brown color. Creates a 2 finger creamy, beige colored head, with really good retention and a whole lot of lace.
Aroma consist of sweet malts, brown sugars, caramelized raisins and other dark fruits with an earthy quality throughout. Some fresh baked bread yeastiness evident as well.
The flavor is also very complex. The front is predominately a sweet malty, toffee-like flavor with some dark fruits evident with a semi-sweet, rich, boozy finish.
Medium-heavy body with a really fine, sparkling carbonation factor. It just feels so good in my mouth. It is a beer that one could drink a lot of, while it is pretty heavy, the alcohol is hardly perceptible aside from the warming sensation. This beer gets a lot of attention but IMO it has definitely earned it's grade.
If you can get this beer do not hesitate. You won't be disappointed. 896 charactersSoneast, Oct 19, 2008

4.56/5  rDev -1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a Westvleteren glass. 10/12/08. Cap has 18.12.10 printed on it.
Pours a deep dark mahogany brown color with about one finger of light tan head. The head slowly dropped to just a thin layer, no lacing. The aroma is amazing and intense. Belgian yeast, bread, sweet malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, apple, raisin, date, fig, toasted nut, banana, clove, and alcohol make up the aroma. Very complex, one of the best smelling beers I've ever had.
Unfortunately the taste does not carry the same complexity as the aroma. It's still darn good though. Sweet malt, Belgian yeast and bread, brown sugar, candied sugar, raisin and fig, and a touch of alcohol make up the taste. The high alcohol (10%) is pretty well hidden.
This beer is smooth and not too heavy. Medium-full body and well-carbonated. Almost creamy. A bit of warmth from the alcohol. Drinkability is pretty good. The alcohol really sneaks up on me. It's really easy to drink for such a big beer. Definitely a sipper though.
Overall, a darn good beer. Try it if you get a chance, though it might be difficult to obtain. 1,112 charactersbkilpatr, Oct 13, 2008

Served @ room temperature 
A- Pours a brown, a little clearer than i would thought, with a light head that it easy to sip through
S- Sweet and spicy, nose didnt really impress me at 1st, but came through more as i drank it. Some notes of figs, clove, bread, caramel
T- Again about halfway through the real flavors start to appear, dried fruit, some lemon, clove, earthy malty notes, very tasty 
M- Not as creamy and thick as i thought it would, carbonation on the low side, with a semi-dry finish
D- Very high, alcohol does not jump at you, and this can be sipped and savored all night
Overall im glad i finally was able to try this beer, did it live up to the hype, yes and no, i still think Rochefort 10 is a better beer, alot cheaper and easier to find. I guess part of the hype with this beer is the availability of it. But dont get me wrong still an awesome beer, and as long as its rare you should try and seek it out at least once.

poured into a tulip glass, produced a nice two finger cream colored head. a beautiful rich brown color with bright ruby highlights around its edges. small to moderate lacing. 
smell is awesome! i get apples, grapes, and a variety of dark fruits. smells delicious. i really wish they made a air freshener that smells like this. yum.
taste doesn't let down. the amazing thing to me is that the flavor hits every one of the tastes. sweet, bitter, sour, smooth. whoever decided to originally brew this should be blown by the hottest of the hot. 
mouth feel is great. just the right amount of carbonation. smooth, gives a nice coating to the mouth. medium bodied. amazing flavor. 
i could drink this beer alot. Its very smooth. and i dont want the end of my glass to come. 
i think alot of this beer is hype. but it is still fantastic. yum. 960 charactersMauerhan, Oct 07, 2008
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Big big thanks to MtGoat for the trade that brought this beer to me. What better beer to review for my 300th than this beer right here in front of me.
A: Pours with a slight chill haze and with some yeast floaties, but otherwise looks like a dark apple cider. Poured into a large mouthed gobblet the head really doesn't get a chnage to show off like other beers but it is lively, bubbling up after a slightly aggressive pour to yeild a half inch sandy white head
S: Candi sugar, a splash of dark rum and brown sugar over a bevy of dark fruits like rasins and plums. Nothing overpowering, just subtle and sweet, very very sweet. Smells a bit like cake, if I close my eyes and sniff.
T/MF: Like the smell, the taste is not overpowering. Sweet, not sugary sweet, but rather a bready, a cupcake-sans-frosting kind of sweetness. Mildly fruity, the slightest bit nutty, brown sugar, sweet bread dough, rum covered rasins. Drinking this I can already tell that I am going to be sad when this beer is gone, this is the first beer I have ever said this about. The feel of this beer, high as an ABV as it does have, drinks so smoothly, bubbles so softly on the tonuge that it almost feels like a sessionable beer. It's size is so well hidden. The alcoholic warmth that does come near the end of the each sip, seems to compliment the rest of the beer, rather than hinder it. Finish is rather clean, but long and lasting, leaving a slight nutty sweetness on the tongue.
D: I can see why this beer is ranked as it is, this beer has something for everyone. It is subtle enough in taste to please even the staunchest BMC drinker around, no boozy heat, not raging hop bitterness or cloying malty sweetness. This is just a perfectly balanced, quiet, non-flashy, beer that is just an absolute pleasure to drink. 1,797 charactersbluemoonswoon, Sep 30, 2008

Cap marked 7.3.10
Been holding this one for a while, I just had a great weekend, and in celebration of that, and the Phillies winning the NL East, I figured this would be a fitting beer.
Pours a dark brown color with a thin off white head.
Aromas are nutty, of booze, oak, and some dark chocolates as well. Very complex and a pleasant to sniff.
Taste starts out with a soft mouthfeel and a crisp finish. Creamy malts, a bit chocolate like, nutty, oaky, and some sweet light cola flavors. Flavors are complex, but soft and meld together really well. It certainly doesn't taste like it's a 10+% ABV beer, only the slightly hint of booze and alcohol warmth. Quite smooth and actually even a little subtle.
Mouthfeel is superb. Thick, full, smooth, and with perfect carbonation.
Drinkability is very good. I really enjoyed this one. It's definitely top notch, excellent, and well worth the praise. However... I'll take Rochefort 10 or Pannepot. I liked those 2 just a little bit better than this one. 1,055 charactersflexabull, Sep 29, 2008
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a deep brown with a nice layer of light brown head. Smells of dried dark fruits with some nice spiciness and caramel. The taste, wow the taste. At first sip, I thought it was pretty good, nice and complex. But the flavor just keeps lingering and developing. Fruits, sugars, a little doughy. Definitely some nutiness in the aftertaste. Also almost seems like a little black tea on the finish. Great mouthfeel. Sticky but smooth. This beer has managed to surpass any expectations I had! 490 charactersnvsblman, Sep 22, 2008

Pours a deep murky brown color with a thick short lived head and a fine ring of lacing.
Scent is deep and fruity with yeast, raspberries, brown sugar, candi sugar and some malts. Top notch scent, I could smell this all day, just wonderful.
Taste of bananas, brown sugar, candi sugar, raspberries and blueberries. Alcohol is present, but is perfectly balanced out with the sweetness. Finish is as strong as the initial taste with the same flavors lingering.
Mouthfeel is powerful and gripping, leaks into your sinus as you hold it in your mouth giving it an incredible depth.
Drinks great for the strength and style.
While not the best beer I have ever had it is certainly one of the best and I believe it was worth the hype. I will be looking to get more of this whenever possible and I am very glad to have been able to try it. 902 characterspaco1029384756, Sep 22, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Major thanks to ralflord for hooking me up with this one.
Pours a cloudy dark chestnut brown color with 2 fingers of creamy tan head into a tulip glass. Amazing retention with beautiful lacing that is both thick and sticky and also slides down the glass to reconnect with its brethren. Smells of cocoa, caramel, vanilla, honey, sweet bread, dark fruits, cinnamon, clove, rose petals, coriander, candy, light yeast, and slight alcohol. Tastes of candy, fruits like apple and pear, spices, a touch of citrus juice, caramel, sweet bready malts, cocoa powder, figs, plums, cherries, earthy notes, peppercorns, a touch of yeast, and a slight dash of alcohol. An amazing balance of flavors, each pronounced at first along the journey and then gently fading away, leaving only a hint of lingering taste behind. Smooth and velvety with a nice dry finish and great carbonation. Simply a fantastic beer, not my favorite beer of all-time, but definitely the best Quadrupel I've experienced and among the best beers out there. For as high in ABV as it is, it covers it up beautifully. This is a sipping beer, but only because you don't want the glass to run empty. Definitely worth a try whenever you may find it. 1,202 charactersHopDerek, Sep 19, 2008

Pours a dark brown with no clarity. A thick brownish head. Aroma was honey and ripe fruit and tones of alcohol, very pleasing. Taste was very complex, some honey, fruit, and alcohol. Very well-balanced with sweetness. Chewy texture with a slight carbonation fizz, very smooth in the palate. Excellent beer good taste and not excessively filling. It does pack a punch which may put it out the desire as a session beer, but enjoyable none the less. 536 characterstbeck, Sep 15, 2008
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The best thing about this beer is it goes through several different changes during the process of drinking it and all of them are great. The pour was a dark brown but not black. The nose came out with dates, caramel, leafs, and strong yeast. The texture was some what like champagne. Tasted way lighter then it looked. I almost could not taste the alcohol at all. When it started to warm up I started getting a heavy tobacco taste, would have even been good with a cigar or what ever it is you put in your pipe. Also some strong licorice flavors. The malt is perfect and not heavy at all. Not sure of the date of mine but I would love to try one of these that as quite of bit of age on it. 689 charactersRoBotGod, Sep 10, 2008

Pour rich into the glass.
Smell was rich with malty undertones.
Appearence was dark roasted brown color. Looked very drinkable.
Taste was smooth, balanced, sweet and finished just the same.

4.84/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to my friend OlieIPA for procuring this in a trade and selling me a bottle.
A- Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice, this beer pours a murky dark brown color with a creamy light-brown head that settles to a medium-thin layer, leaving only a few sheets of lacing after each sip. 
S- The aroma is sugary and malty with sticky dark fruits, molasses and Belgian yeast as the most prominent characteristics. There are accents of indiscernible spices and with burnt sugar as well. The alcohol is only slightly noticeable even as the beer reaches room temperature. 
T- The initial taste mirrors the aroma, with flavors of malty sweetness and dark fruits making their way to maple syrup and brown sugar town. There is a slight alcohol warmth on the finish, which also leaves a mild tea-like bitterness on the palate. 
M- The mouthfeel is creamy and velvety smooth with very mild carbonation. 
D- This beer is very drinkable considering its immensely complex flavor profile and a 10.2% ABV. Each sip leaves you in anticipation of the next. 1,053 charactersTdizzle, Sep 01, 2008

I figured this was the perfect time to celebrate this brew the last weekend of summer, the working mans weekend, and all truly life is good.
Bottle served slightly chilled in my favorite chalice. The pour produced a good two fingers worth of Brown head that goes to a great lace. The body was brown to a dark red in color 
The nose has tons of Malts and dark fruits It is a little less Intense than expected But it may be just reality catching up to expectation. There was a hint of spice and alcohol as well as it warms.
Flavors of sweet dark fruits filled my mouth raisins figs and such. As it warms more of the alcohol is present in its bite but so does the spiciness in the flavor as well .Great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation for its style
For this holy grail of all brews this was a pleasure to drink, highly drinkable. The rarity of this brew aside. I do think it is close to a few of the other Belgian Quads I have tried St. Bernardus comes to mind. Don't get me wrong this brew was better balanced in the flavor department but I think if it comes down to it St. Bernardus is a close second. 
Thanks again Life is good for sharing such a rare brew as well as another BA who will remain nameless for trading me one to put away for my son when he is legal age. Who knows I may even split it 60 /40 LOL 1,438 charactersjoepais, Aug 31, 2008

I raise the glass to my nose and scents of warm red grapes, cranberry and cherry come flooding into my awareness. The sweet smell of fruit, caramel and toffee candy wraps itself so nicely around the significantly boozy brew. It pours over my lips and onto my tongue. Sudden sweetness hits me with flavours of red wine, plums, and wild berries. The sweetness is quickly followed by a refreshing dryness brought on by the high alcohol content. Both the sweet and the bitter mingle and dance on the palette in perfect unison, and linger into a long dry aftertaste that leaves me begging for more. The low carbonation takes the edge off of what might have otherwise been a sharp and bitter dryness, and makes it so very easy to drink. And then I had a second sip. 947 charactersQuej, Aug 27, 2008
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Gracias goryshkewych for trading me this puppy. Let us now see if it was really worth the hype. Been waiting a while to try and here goes nothing. 
Lovely nondescript Westy bottle poured into a nondescript chalice. Served mildly chilled at what seems to be the right temperature.
A: Oak brown color with a head that is incredibly lasting. Lacing surprisingly strong as well, a looker by all means. The puffy chestnut head stayed creamy through the entire drink.
N: Raisins, dates and dried figs. Sweet belgian malts, deep caramel and spices. Pleasant in every sense of the word. Like the smell of a floured, sweet mapled waffle. 
T: Fabulous, figs and dates. Just like chewing on those figs that have the natural sugar on the outside. The warmth of this drink balances out the taste perfectly. The sweetness lasts on the front, the back, and all other parts of the tongue. Packing this amount of sweetness from all you can ask for in a Belgian into something so drinkable and balanced is artwork.
M: No cloning the mouthfeel of this one. Unlike anything Ive had before. This is where it really sets itself apart from other quality quads like st. bernadus. The creaminess is perfect.
D: Most complex beer I have had for a belgian like this. Almost hard to describe. It takes on different character throughout drinking it. Cant wait to have more at some time. 
Was it worth the hype and hope? Indeed. 1,405 charactersmarcpal, Aug 21, 2008
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Westmalle chalice. Date on the cap 23.04.11.
A - I may have poured it too delicately because the head was very thin and there was no lacing whatsoever. The body was magnificent though, cloudy brownish red that made my mouth water just looking at it.
S - So complex! Sweet aromas of cherries, plums, and red apples come through the strongest, complimented by more earthy aromas from the yeast. There seems to be much more going on here, but I'm not even going to try to figure out what it is. 
T - Even more complex than the smell. The fruits, sugars, and yeast all combine to create a taste that leaves your palate writhing in a purely orgasmic state. The mix of sweetness and breadiness is simply divine. The alcohol tries to poke its head out as it warms, but even then it stays very well hidden.
M - Holy freaking Christ!!!! I never would have thought a Belgian quad could be so smooth! It's thick and fairly wet on the tongue and leaves a faint cherry aftertaste on the palate. The carbonation is low, but still keeps the sweetness in check perfectly. Oh, did I mention how incredibly smooth it is?
D - Please sir, may I have another?
Notes: This beer is positively phenomenal. Even without the hype and exclusivity, I have no doubt in my mind that I could easily call this the Holy Grail of beers. This beer doesn't need the hype to make it world-class. It speaks well enough for itself. 1,412 characterspwsoldier, Aug 20, 2008

VLAAMSVEST '08
Served at Cambrinus in Brugge, in a branded Trappist Westvleteren chalice. Best before 17/10/10.
Intense milky black-brown. Coffee mottled offwhite tan head. Mossy in texture. Effervescent. Unbelievably good retention that's impossible to deny. Great! On the nose: plums, ripe apples, sour cherries, diacetyl, apple juice, hint of yeasty funk. Chocolate, coffee, cane sugar, rye bread, port wine. Raisins, dates. (the point in my notes where I write an expletive).
Surprisingly light palate with carbonation, sweetish on the tongue with moderate alcoholic/yeasty bitterness. Chocolate malt. Mouth-coating. Something in the background I'm not getting... nuts - definitely. Slightly salty. Tropical fruit?! Cookie dough, coffee cake - caramel. Malt whisky. Well hidden abv.
Is this the best? I don't know. I started my adventure in legality about one year ago and I've already enjoyed what is commonly regarded as "the greatest beer on earth". No matter - breweries change and I have no doubt that within my lifetime W-12 will be unseated, hopefully for the better. In the meantime... I'll keep on coming back for this stuff. 1,296 charactersAntilochus, Aug 20, 2008

The craft had been whiling away the years for the better part of a century. Settled royally atop her mount, she directed the footsoldiers as they traipsed through the underbrush, brandishing their pikes and longswords against the inhuman foe of the dark wood. Occasional copses and dales provided much-needed relief from the dense thickets that made up the majority of the wooded landscape. Atop the mountain they had seen afar their destination, and the lady would not rest until they had inhaled the aromatic glory and tasted the nectar of liquid perfection. The going was hard through the wood, and the clearing came none too soon, but they had arrived. A friar greeted them warmly, welcoming them to the humble monastery in which was conceived one of the greatest treasures on earth. Apart from the Bible and his countless hours of prayer, one passion consumed him. The same passion which had consumed so many of his forefathers and would yet become a passion for thousands of years to come. He had created one of the marvels of the then-modern world, the perfect combination of hops, malt, pure water, and yeast.
The appearance was brown, with a crown of light tan head which would cling to the ridge of the goblet of whomever had the pleasure of enjoying it. The lady was taken aback by the complexity of the aromas, contrasted with the dank odour of the stone corridors in the bowels of the monastery. The flavour was rapturous. rich, complex flavours of dark fruits, the yeast lending a spicy character and the alcohol rounding out the drink with a warmth and intensity that she had not experienced before. She let out a deep sigh. She could die content now, as she held in her hands what her heart had so longed for. 1,838 characterskhiasmus, Aug 19, 2008

First look appears as a murky brown color with shades of ruby. 1/2inch head that slowly recedes to small ring of sticky lace.
Smell is not overpowering but there is sweet candy, bread like yeast and ripe fruit. The taste: WOW, sweet ripe fruits like dates, plums, and cherries. Malty backbone with hardly any hop bite. This is one complex brew as other flavors pull through; licorice, yeasty esters (in a good way), and more sweet candy. Thick mouthfeel yet semidry finish. This brew goes down amazingly smooth given the ABV and complexity. ABV seems almost non-existent until the end when it warms, definitely sneaks up on you.
Drinkability is of course fanatstic and this is my favorite quad. The best beer in the world? Definitely not but within range... 862 charactersphattysbox, Aug 08, 2008

The so-called Holy Grail for many beer geeks, with single bottles going for upwards of $20 in the US. This bottle is at least eight years old. Poured into a silver-rimmed Westvleteren chalice. Translucent brown with shimmering ruby hues, and a thick, tightly-laced, creamy, sticky head above. Similar aroma as the other Westys; a complex, deep malted nose of carob, toffee and honey. Massive creamy buildup on the palate, as the tight carbonation hits the warmth of the mouth. Silky smooth, with a dry, medium, even body. Again with the powdery feel. Interesting twang of grapes. Dextrin sweetness. More carob, golden syrup, blossom honey, toffee, medicinal phenols, anise, ginger, booze-soaked golden raisins, raw candi sugar and a watery, slightly fruity currant character. Alcohol on this one is quite boozy and warming. Bone-dry, powdery, with a residual cocoa character and alcohol breath. 
Stellar fresh, preferred fresh, damn good aged. Best beer in the world? That's a debate for the forums on BeerAdvocate.com, but it's de&#64257;nitely among the top. 1,116 charactersBeerAdvocate, Jul 24, 2008

A - Translucent dark brown-amber with a white-ish head that diminishes. Not much lacing.
S - Dark dried fruits, candi sugar, and some yeast present. Not a huge smell, but gorgeous overall.
T - YUM. Normally I hate raisins, but I get the point of them from drinking the notes in this brew. Caramel, molasses, yeast, and of course malt. It's everything you'd want from a candy store sans chocolate.
M - This is honestly my favorite part of the beer. Lively carbonation gives it a unique sort of creaminess unlike any other beer I've had, period. It honestly feels perfect.

---
Poured into a Rochefort Trappist chalice
A: Initially this pours a murky, sediment filled brown color but after drinking 1/2 of it, you can see ruby highlights throughout. thick creamy off white almond colored head. Unfortunately this didn't leave very much lacing at all.
UPDATE: There was barely any sediment in this bottle. It poured a beautiful, clear (until the very last ounce) brown/ruby color. The last little bit was a bit muddy but to be expected, I think. Head formation was decent and lacing was pretty much non-existent. Rating bumped to 4.5.
S: soon as the cap was popped off the scent of strong sweet fruit filled the air. There's a medium heavy malting, brown sugar, deep dark fruits, cherries mostly and it's slightly alcoholic. Smells like a combo of berry pie and caramel.
UPDATE: This smelled amazing and as described above. I bumped my rating to 5.0.
T&M: very smooth taste, medium bodied beer which is perfect for the style. sweet and malted, lots of fruits on the palate but so much complexity that it's hard to pinpoint what flavors I'm experiencing. Non noticeable bitterness or hop flavor. Needless to say this feels and tastes great! The only thing I'm not too keen on is the "bits" of sediment that get stuck between your teeth as you're nearing the end of the bottle. I could do without that.
UPDATE: Similar to above minus the "bits" of sediment. This was clearly a higher quality beer, one that was most likely not aged for as long or aged under better environmental conditions. Taste rating bumped to a solid 5.0! Def worth it! Can't really find a flaw in the mouthfeel either - 5.0 too.
D: Pretty high ABV that's masked almost completely. Great sweet, fruity taste, if it weren't for the carbonation I'd think I was drinking some kind of concentrated berry juice.
Overall impressions: This is one of the most sought after, legendary beers. Given it's availability, it makes it that much more precious and highly coveted. While it is a great beer, and a fine example of the style, dare I say that I think it's slightly overrated and that there are better examples of the style available closer to home, namely Rochefort 10 and St Bernadus Abt 12.
Big thanks to zaf88 for this trade. I feel blessed to have tried this truly unique brew. 2,454 charactersjulian, Jul 21, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz bottle poured gently into my Chimay chalice. A cloudy, coffee color with wisps of bubbles on top and a ring around the edge. No visible carbonation and some sediment made its way in. Scattered spots of lace on my glass. 
Smell is candy sugar and malted grains. Bready notes are played along with a touch of brandy. Fusel alcohol is mixed with belgian yeast esters, associated fruits like banana, and spices.
Taste is big malty sweetness featuring a shade of molasses and dark fruits. Alcoholic bite sets in but is never aggressive. Yeast brings out a brandy like facet as in the Westy 8 but it is more forward due to the alcoholic presence that is invisible in the 8. Fruits like figs, raisins and banana swirl in and out. While not as overtly layered and complex as the 8 it is nonetheless a multifaceted brew. Actually the layering and complexity is more subtle and harder to dissect. The finish is mildly bitter with a short hop kiss and a gently lingering alcoholic note that fades to dark breads and sweet rolls. 
Mouthfeel is perfectly weighted, light with enough girth to chew on, gently slick, subtle carbonation.
Drinkability is very good for this abv. While not a session beer, certainly one that is easy to drink too fast because of it's ease of consumption. 1,281 charactersscootny, Jul 19, 2008

The flavors are all mild, in fact a good notch milder than I'd prefer, but they are very well-combined in an intriguing package. I kept sipping at it to try to get a grip on the elusive flavor. A great beer and well worth trying, but not as intense as some other quads. I liked the St. B a bit better, and at a quarter of the price it's no contest. 518 charactersPhxHorn, Jul 15, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Pours a dark brown color with a slight haze, fantastic Belgian lace.
S - Complex! Rich malt characters that mingle with the phenolic and fruity yeast components and hops to make an amazing balance.
T - Very malty flavors, dark fruit, bready, toasty. The malt mixes with the yeast characters and hops to provide and wonderful experience.
M - Medium body provides a very drinkable beer without it being to full, good carbonation and excellent alcohol warmth.
This is a wonderful beer! It achieves a balance in both aroma and flavor such that nothing is dominate but rather achieves a complexity that keeps you looking for more! 630 charactersdonaldchapman, Jul 14, 2008
4.53/5  rDev -1.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours dark murky brown in color. The light tan head was massive and stuck around for a while. As expected, lacing was phenomenal. This is quite an attractive brew.
S - Caramel and dark bread are prominent in the aroma. Some fruitiness shows up as a backing aroma. Mostly prune and fig is what I picked up. Some sweeter spices and alcohol round out the flavor. 
T - Mostly sweet. Caramel, candied suger, brown suger, and molasses come to mind. Dark bread is very present and makes for a nice background to the sweeter flavors. Fruitiness in the taste leans more toward prune and plum. Cinnamon and clove make up the spice profile. Warm alcohol and hints of chocolate finish up the flavor.
M - Medium to full bodied with great carbonation. Finish is sweet and cleaner than expected. 
D - Drinkability is good. The high abv does place limits on how many of these that should be consumed at once. There is really nothing bad that can be said about this beer. It excels in every category. Glad I got the chance to try one of these and I'd definitely have another. 1,066 characterscsmiley, Jul 14, 2008

A: pours brown with a grape, fig-like color, opaque; tightly-beaded head of a light tan color that gently settles into the beer and laces.
S: yeasty, fresh-baked bread, dark fruit/fig, very slight noble hop spiciness. Scores just shy of perfect because I have to work for it a little.
T: Starts with chocolate and quickly follows with lots of dark fruit, fig, plum, grape fruit flavor. Settles into a sweet caramel, molasses taste, ending with a bitterness mixed with noble hops and alcohol that lingers into the aftertaste, which is almost numbing.
M: very light, somewhat fluffy, effervescent. a little sticky, light but viscous.
D: Scores just shy of perfect as this is a strong sipper, Complexity in this beer is unmatched and the balance is better than any I have tried. It seems I get a little more of everything--the fruity, malty, yeasty flavors mixed with just a little hops at the end. 955 charactersjoeysmokedporter, Jul 12, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Beer poured straight from the bottle into a tall goblet. It had been stored for a couple months from the date of purchase in an light-free and cool place in the house.
It poured a strong "cola" color with a dark-brown and almost milky head. The carbonation was quite visible and more so then most beers I've had. The head seemed to stay, very slightly, throughout drinking. For the dark color it was still a pretty clear pour.
It smelled so sweet. Not a bad sweet though, not like a pot of warm, double-boiler chocolate type sweet, but somewhat cinnamony(?). It wasn't overpowering and it pulls you in.
After taking a sip the sweetness seems to dance over the tongue and into the cheeks. For this sweetness it goes down very smooth and has a minimal aftertaste. I had it by itself, but I could see it going well with a nice creamy cheese for some reason. I think the flavors would balance well.
I received six of these from someone in Belgium and sold all but two of them. I wanted to keep a couple and try it out and I'm glad I did. I wish it were widely available in the states. Of course the value or mystic of it would go down, but regardless it is a beer that I could see myself drinking any day of the week. More so in the winter months, but a nice relaxing evening would work well. I recommend this to anyone who has the chance to taste it.

Pours out a warm smooth deep brown, very murky, with a decent head..
Lovely aroma of chocolate, cinnamon, raisins, yeast, and that familiar Belgian sugariness...
Well, it is delicious. Loaded with sweet dark fruits and hints of cocoa and cinnamon, it is a deceptively strong and tasty brew.. 
I guess its probably sacrilege to say this but this wasn't my favorite Belgian. It was good but not the best I've ever had. Still... I'm priveleged to have gotten the opportunity to try this. 545 charactersTilley4, Jul 10, 2008

11.2 oz brown bottle with no label and a unique yellow cap
Served in a Chimay chalice
I served this one at just the right temperature (around 58 degrees or so). Pours a chestnut brown with a massive head that forms on top. Incredible trails of sticky lace patterns cling to the sides of chalice. 
The nose is malty with whiffs of Belgian yeast and sweet fruit that linger in the background. Aroma is not quite as intense as one might expect, but yet quite effective.
First sip is pure bliss. Juicy, chewy-rich malts provide the backbone of this beer with a sharp and striking hop finish. Flavors of Belgian sugar, caramel, dried fruit (prunes, figs & raisins), toffee and ripe rasberries. 
A significantly strong offering that is deceptively smooth, complex and extremely enjoyable. The smoothness is almost creamy in its delivery. The mouthfeel is outstanding and arguably the best I've ever tasted. 
An exquisite and marvelous masterpiece that defines the beauty of beer. 1,003 charactersHibernator, Jul 09, 2008
4.63/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5My first Westy! Here we go...
Pours a maple color with a nice 1/2-1 finger foamy, off whiite head. I'm not getting any lacing.
I smell a ton of dark fruit, bread, candy, spices. There's a lot in the nose of this. Similar to the Pannepot Fisherman's Ale, but much more balanced and pleasant.
I taste raisin, fig, caramel corn, perhaps even some candy sugar-coated nuts.
This is also going down way too easy. I'm hardly detecting the alcohol in this at all. What a masterwork. 478 charactersrudylaw, Jul 07, 2008
4.6/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Nesued for giving me the chance to try this one.
Pours a raisin colored richness with surprising clarity, even with some sediment from the bottom. Creamy full head settles slowly.
Nose is very complex and intriguing, nearly vinous, with notable sweet dark fruits of raisin, blackberry, and plum, some full bready malt, grapes, and a subtle spice.
For the strength, depth of flavor, and complexity, this remains very delicate and fine. More bready character saturated with candy sweet fruit and a soft lingering spicy note are pronounced on the tongue. Not overly sweet, not too dry, and surprisingly lacking the 10+% abv taste.
Feel is very pleasant, medium bodied with enough carbonation to lighten it up just a little. Smooth, with the impression of being syrupy, though somehow remaining much lighter and more delicate.
Deceivingly rich, with masterfully crafted character, it's very difficult to say how drinkable this is. So enjoyable to sip. While I certainly want more, I found it very satisfying. 1,019 characterslightindarkness, Jul 05, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Westvleteren 12...the rosetta stone for many beer drinkers. This one was tasted alongside St. Bernardus 12, and Rochefort 10. Poured in to an Ommegang chalice a lovely dark rosewood color, with lighter rosy hues at the bottom of the glass, and a fluffy tannish/white heading that clings the the glass, and has great retention. Nose can only be described as extremely deep, with layers of prune, candy, licorice, caramel, more sweet dark fruit...the list goes on and on. Taste is quite breathtaking, and complex. Begins very rich and sweet, with dark fruit such as plum, prune and date. Chocolate can also be detected lingering in the background somewhere. Alcohol also lends itself perfectly to the flavors, giving it the perfect amount of richness and depth of character without overdoing it. The end of the beer is interesting, in that although there is little bitterness in initial flavor, there is some int he finish, that one might describe as spicy, and perhaps a bit earthy. Mouthfeel is the most exceptional aspect of Westy 12 in that it is just so damn smooth on the palate. It was a sort of cask conditioned beer character to it, yet it is bottled. Sometimes I think cask conditioning beer takes a bit away complexity and flavor wise, but with this one there is not much left to be desired. Drinkability is very very high, despite the high ABV, although I don't think I could bring myself to drinking more than one of these in a sitting....that might just be too decadent for me. As far as the other two beers, I am sad to say that they did not even come close. The Rochefort was a bit more robust and boozy, whereas the St. Bernardus was lighter, more carbonated, and quite a bit spicier. Ok, so final verdict: This is my second time tasting this brew, and the first time I was less than impressed. This tasting, on the other hand blew me away. I now have no problem proclaiming that this is the best Belgian Quad, and one of the best beers in the world. I suspect that this will be a permanent member of my want list for a while.

Taste- Incredible. Great tastes of dark fruits, chocolate and spices(cloves, anise). The high ABV is hidden well.
Mouthfeel- Nice thick yet smooth mouthfeel with medium high carbonation.

4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5.33 l bottle into a Chimay goblet. Thanks to deepsouth for the trade and opportunity to try this. 
Pours a dark brown with +1 fingers of creamy looking tan foam head. The retention is just beautiful looking, with a smooth and creamy layer that sticks around for a good bit and leaves behind thick lacing that coats the sides of the glass and then cascades down. This is one of those beers that I could just sit there and watch swirl around in the glass for hours on end. The bouquet on this is quite a complex and well balanced little fume of aromas with sweet notes of cocoa powder, vanilla, and candied sugar giving way to dark fruit tartness and the scent of an earthy oakiness. There is quite a nice contrast and interplay between the sweet and tart notes. 
The taste profile is similar to the aroma being both complex, well balanced and layered. A delicious sweet mix of candied sugars, chocolate, and bready malts with some deep dark fruit notes and spices. There is also an earthy feel and yeast presence but they are very subtle and integrated perfectly into the surroundings. For me though, the mouthfeel of this beer is where is absolutely excels. It's got a very rich texture yet still feels smooth and mellow in the mouth with fantastic carbonation. There is maybe just the teeniest, tiniest bit of alcohol in the body but for the most part that 10+% ABV is absolutely no where to be found. 
This beer carries a lot of expectations and while it wasn't quite a perfect beer for me, it still came pretty darn close. The look, smell, and taste of this are outstanding but it's the body and drinkibility that are truly world class, being rich and complex but still immensely smooth and quaffable. Absolutely worth seeking out. 1,737 charactersKegatron, Jun 27, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to brianj555 for trade. Now I know what the hype is about. Pours a very cloudy, chestnut brownish color. A soft off white head with a light tan hue to it. Good retention through the tasting though hid to the side of the glass. I don't know why but I guess I was expecting more viscous of a liquid. Not bad just thinking aloud.
The nose is rich with malt and some very nice esters that blend really well. Overall that is what is great is that everything is present but nothing dominates. To start there is a very complex malt with hints of caramel and sweet bready and light note of biscuit. Hints of cinnamon and cloves but brings the breadiness out. A minor chocolate notes. Great fruity aromas that blend well. Some figs, raisins, plums and olives (yes olives). Some minor cherry and rose peddles. The yeast notes are light with no major residual, most esters. Some alcohol but light as well.
The taste is similar where the flavors are present but don't dominate. Very well balanced. The malt is prominent than what the nose indicated. There is a nice blend of caramel and bready flavors. The chocolate comes out but doesn't give it a lactic quality. There is a bit of roast that is noticeable in the finish. Less spice flavors but still leaves the bready quality in the flavor. Some salty and peppery flavors in the finish as well. The fruit notes seemed lighter than the nose (maybe why the malt came out). Figs and cherries really come out more but limited raisins and plums. Hints of pears and mangos as well. The yeast again is really subtle. As is the alcohol, but some minor solvent notes are detectable.
The body is really key here. There is noticeable body here but finishes dry for style. Just interesting to see all the flavor come out and then drop out with a lingering flavor. Overall a great beer. Loved the complexity and blend overall. I can see why this is a treat for so many! 1,906 charactersOxymoron, Jun 26, 2008

To describe the aroma as complex would be an understatement. Figs, raisins, rum soaked sweetbread, ripe fruit, alcohol, and some spices just to start off. What a great combonation. A beer that you could sit and smell forever.
Huge amount of ripe and dark fruit, along with some fig. Good amount of boozy flavor, without being overbearing. Hints of sweetness, but very well balanced. Long lingering rum soaked raisin finish.
Very warming, without being too hot. This could probably age with the best of them. Light body, with a good amount of carbonation aids in drinkability. What a world-class beer! 818 charactersBierguy5, Jun 21, 2008
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Absolutely deserving of the best beer in the world title. Has such an utter depth and complexity it will leave your head spinning. Aesthetics are quite nice with a dark color and a pleasant tan head, but the smell is when you realize something incredibly is coming. Fruits, spices, candy, it just hits you all at once with an intensity even stronger than a Dogfish 120.
On a side note, if at all possible wait to try this beer until you are able to make the pilgrimaged out to the monastery in Belgium. The surrounding country is some of the most peaceful and quiet farmland I've ever seen, and builds up the experience of trying the beer to a whole new level. 661 characterspunkindrublic50, Jun 18, 2008

Smell- Notes of fruit with an undertone of alcohol. Smell is definitely the weakest part of this beer but it is still quite lovely. Smell almost seems to be running away from the beer and into my nose.
Taste- WOW!!! Very thick on the tongue, alcohol is very well disguised and beer is incredibly balanced. Hints of chocolate, ever so slight bitterness, candy, and some candied fruit flavors. Carbonation has slight pop on the aftertaste that really leaves the taste to linger.
Mouthfeel- So thick! I can almost chew this beer, its truly wonderful, fills palate and the taste just lingers for ages.
Drinkability- A+ no doubt about it this beer is delicious and has no peer that Ive yet tried.
Update to review: Tasted this beer again at the 2013 "The Festival" in Portland, Me.
This is only my second time ever seeing or having this beer. What struck me most about it upon a second try was the predominance of chocolate that I tasted. It is very delicious, perhaps a little boozy once it starts warming up, but a very, very tasty beer. 1,222 charactersBowdoinbeerboy, Jun 17, 2008

The nose gave off complex scents of sweet dark fruit, raisins, dark malt, chocolate dipped toffee, yeast, mineral and dark caramel. In the mouth it was medium-bodied with nice concentration yet light-on-its-feet due to the abundance of carbonation. The mouthfeel is soft and round with good richness in the midpalate which adds some dry/bitterness on the finish.

Some friends from Belgium and I used the opportunity to cook some game and drink this from some Westvleteren chalices which had a really nice shape to them. The bottle had been aged 5 years. When we poured it out it was difficult to get a decent head on it. My friend thought perhaps we should have washed the glasses a bit differently. The smell and taste were rich with toffee. It had a nice sweetness to it that gave way to some warmth from the alcohol at the end. A very fine beer, and one that I will look forward to trying fresh. 588 charactersdill, Jun 11, 2008
4.78/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5An unmarked, unlabeled 12 oz bottle purchased from the Bier Tempel in Brussels. I saved this, my first taste of the Westvleteren 12, for the last night of my first trip to Belgium, August 2007. I refused to brush my teeth before bed that night...
It glows a gorgeous burgundy when held up to the ceiling but is quite dark away from the lights. The beer is, at normal angle, only a shade or two deeper than scarlet or the aforementioned burgundy; such a lovely colour. A dusty white coloured head perches atop, appearing thin but is, in actuality, quite thick and sturdy along the perimeter. 
The aroma is a soft mix of nuts, caramel and bready malts. The yeast seems to accentuate something akin to pralines or walnuts. I finally would place creme brulee in the smell as well. Almonds maybe, raisins for sure. Became increasingly fruity. Even though I didn't find the aroma to live up to other aspects of the beer, no arguments here, this is one beautiful yeast! In this beer's case, the smell mimics the taste (not vice versa), although it hardly hints at how great it is... 
A very neat water profile. The yeast and mineral character of the water seem to play with one another. There is little carbonation with a sandy texture. The flavours don't seem to last too long on the tongue, they are very gentle. 
I was completely and utterly taken away with the flavour - it is loaded and lovely. Notes of dates, prunes, plums, and increasingly, a strong taste of grapes. Slightly chocolaty alongside flavour of nuts and raisin. My first impression of the Westvleteren 8 was 'chocolate covered raisins' which is the same idea here. 
Sampling the trio all in one night I wasn't sure, initially, which one I like best. But I simply kept upping the marks in the 12, growing to like it more and more and more and more. I wish I was a monk...
Is this damn good? Yes. Great? Yea. Amazing? Well... yea. 
This is unique, as all Trappists are. Is it better? Not necessarily. Each Trappists is unique and to be appreciated in its own right. Is this deserving of the title of worlds best? Well... I overheard a server here in Belgium put it best: "whatever beer you like, then that is a good beer"... 2,191 charactersbiegaman, Jun 02, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A 2001 vintage Westy 12 was the grand finale of my 05/21/08 tasting with a friend. Poured into an Ommegang chalice.
Appearance: A deep, crystalline brown with a roaring ocean of head yields delicate, mild lacing. Looks downright regal in the chalice I had mine in. It's not huge, it's not flat - it just looks great.
Aroma: Loads of goodies here. Raisins and other sweet stone fruits, light woody tannins, licorice, both light, sweet sugars and darker, molasses-esque sugars. Some sweet, spicy alcohol too. Divine.
Taste: Mmmph. So wonderfully complex. Sweet, bready and caramel malts and fruit sugars - figs, cherries - are reminiscent of Christmas pudding. Light, simple sugars - honey, pure brown sugar and molasses notes - are balanced by mild, spicy, dry hops, and that delicious, deceptively-smooth alcohol in the finish rounds things out. Divin ... er?
Mouthfeel: Goose-feather pillow, and maybe the best feeling beer I've ever had. The profile is easily the most even - velvet smoothness, with a medium-to-high body. Amazing.
Drinkability: My notes just say "OMG," I guess I was pretty gone by this point. But this beer was truly phenomenal - the alcohol was barely noticeable, and everything was balanced so perfectly you can't help but take another sip. And so I did.
A classic - the classic perhaps - and rightfully so. Perfect in most ways a beer can be perfect, if you ever are lucky enough to get your hands on one of these ... well, I'll pay you for it. 1,474 charactersCrellMoset, Jun 01, 2008

A: Pours a beautiful deep brown with mahogany hints around the edges. The head is a rocky off-white two fingers thick which lingers for quite a while and leaves minimal lacing.
S: Where do I start with the aroma? Sweet bready caramel malts with huge dark fruit aromas of raisins and plums up front. Big and complex with molasses, brown sugar, and some spices on top of that. Just a wonderfully aromatic brew.
T: Just like the smell, the taste is just incredibly complex and wonderful. There is a prevailing sweetness that pervades the entire flavor with molasses, dark fruit, caramel, and vanilla. Spices are also present but perfectly balanced with the sweetness and malts.
M: Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth but with a nice big carbonation that tickles the tongue. I honestly don't think you could improve the mouthfeel...exceptional.
D: Well, what else to add to the praise? I'm not sure if this is the best beer I've ever had, but it's pretty damn close. It's unbelievably complex but extremely drinkable and is certainly the best of the style I have ever tasted.

S: nothing too strong, as it warmed the bouquet opened up. there is an almost prune aroma with a some what sweet ester as a backbone. the aroma ends with a slight yeasty kick.
T: when you drink this beer at a cooler temp you are cheating yourself. it starts out with a bit of alcohol and yeasty fruit taste. as it warms it really opens up. you have a semi sweet start (think a raspberry in a bitter chocolate shell) and a spicey back of your tongue finish. as it warms it also becomes more smooth there is an earthy caramel taste as well, not sweet, but still caramel. there is also the yeasty component that is most evident on the finish and is more pungent than a hefe.
M/D: as it warms it becomes amazingly smooth and easy to drink. the carbonation is very easy and does not distract. the drinkability only gets a 4.5 because im not sure i could sit and just go at this all day. I know id never turn one down, but it also might not be the first beer i grab (may...)
this is a fun, interesting beer to get the pleasure to try. if you like quads it wont disappoint...

Trappist Westvleteren, "bevat gerstemout", bier, 12 circled,bier, 10% vol... I really do believe that "God's Brewers" should be added somewhere.
Brown with hints of dark cherry in color with light carb bubbles and a 1/3" head that fades to 1/4". Head is cream white. Looks like a thicker cider.
Smells of raisins, caramel and slightly sweet. Spicy alcohol fill the end of the inhale.
Suede Mouthfeel with a medium carbonation. The spicy character hides the malt nicely. Pretty sweet like with a nice warming from the ever present alcohol. Lingering spiciness and dry fruit flavors.
Very creamy mouthfeel, very smooth.
O the big flaw is how smooth this beer is. Hell I didn't want to wait for it to warm up a little. This has been the most impatient I've been with a beer. Waiting this glass to warm as I drank it made me agitated. I wanted to keep drinking this amazing beer. To to drinkable. I wish I could buy a 6 pack of Westy 12's at ANY store.

This is (I'm still drinking as I write) a great beer. 
Nice smell. A little bit of natural vanilla and some figs. It's a very sweet smell. It gives you a good clue as to the sweet taste that is to come.
Not too hard hitting like some of the other stronger Belgians out there. I'm suprised this is as drinkable as it is. I could drink a few of these. 
The carbonation is nice and bubbly, but fades rather quickly. The immediate taste is of sugary figs. It leaves almost a licorice aftertaste behind, that sticks around for a couple minutes after each sip. 
It is a very complex, and very sweet, flavor without being too hard on the palate.
I'd have to say this beer was worth the money, and worth the wait. It certainly lives up to the hype. 867 characterschemmie, May 15, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5At Gollem, Amsterdam, 12-2-07. Dark brown, beige head, lace. Looks perfect in its own chalice, very elegant. My first impression of the aroma is lots of yeast; very bready and doughy. Then prunes, dates, and pure malt; not overly sweet, and very intricate. the flavor is bready as well; plenty of spice and dried fruit, but not sugary., and surprisingly not as sweet as the other abts I've had. No alcohol flavor. The palate is very smooth and full, almost perfect. Goes down cleanly with a finish that leaves a pleasant but not overly sweet taste in your mouth for quite a while. I knew that they would have this when I was planning my trip to Amsterdam, but I was almost in disbelief until I actually ordered it and forked over the twelve euros. It was served out of the cellar, like the St. Bernardus 12 that I had the nigh before, and that temperature perfectly complimented its flavors. As the last of the top three abts to have rated, in comparison I would say that westy is by far the most drinkable and balanced. I think that Rochefort has more complexities in the aroma, which I really like, but it can be too rich and alcoholic. St Bernardus is about the same in intensity as westy, but lacks the powerful yeastiness and complexity of flavor. Price wise, is it three times better than St Bernardus? No way, and I know I'll be lucky to get another one any time soon, which I guess is part of the mystique. 1,414 charactersbulletrain76, May 15, 2008

Pours a cloudy dark brown. Would have been clear, but I got over zealous with the pour and let some yeasties in. Thin whitish head doesn't stick around very long.
Aroma starts off with some vanilla and slight chocolate, but really comes to live as the brew warms. Banana's, plums, lots of malty goodness. Taste is caramel, dried fruit some alcohol as she warms. Medium mouthfeel with a bit of stickeyness. Nice carbonation. Definately worthy of the hype. 519 charactersjohnnnniee, May 14, 2008

Pours a very dark brown with not much head into my authentic Westvleteren chalice. Oh, the anticipation.
The smell in taste are remarkably complex. Banana, wheatiness, great subtle spiciness, nice full malt sugars. Every taste reveals additional flavors. In some ways it tastes like a nice wheat doppelbock. And the alcohol is so incredibly well concealed.
Amazing. I could drink this beer forever. And I don't think I'm being biased by the hype. 582 charactersbassmantin, May 13, 2008

Pours a red tinged chestnut with 2+ fingers of sand colored head. Very good lacing & head retention, almost pulled 5.0... 
S: Fruittyness, a touch of chocolate; dark fruit takes over as this warms
T: Dark fruits, some cocoa, licorice& touch of boozyness up front. Loads of dark fruit, raisins, figs, & dates, plus dryness as this warms, along with some warming booze & just a touch of leafy hops, plus brown sugar. Finishes fruitty with woody dryness & a touch of vanilla & some tobacco like hops
MF: Medium bodied, with pretty lively carbonation, this one brings a an overall warming sensation
Drinks pretty good for the ABV & complexity, maybe a touch hot alcohol-wise, but in line with the style. A super, quad, this is the best quad I've had. The flavor & aromatics are superior for the style. I could happily stock this in my cellar, but I am just as happy with St. Benardus Abt 12 & Pannepot (sic).

4.78/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally having the opportunity to take part in the 'earned hype.' I had been looking forward to this for a little while, and went about getting the temperature just right and so forth
A: A very dark brown pour, with a touch of ruby highlights. Surprisingly dark, moreso than I was expecting. A two finger head, pale tan / offwhite, nice and sticky, good retention. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the size of the head on here, especially considering the ABV. 
S: A ton of dark fruit, sweet candi sugar scents, almost caramel like, too. A smoky, and woody quality, kinda oak like. 
T: Sugary dark fruit... A very notable raisin, fig, and date flavour. A warm, alcohol flavour... A little sweet, a little tart, a little peppery/spicy. A nice earthiness, smokiness, leather and tobacco. A lot going on, and beautifully balanced. Certainly my favourite of the trappists, and a very fine abbey ale. 
M: Big, rich, and round. A nice, fizzle of carbonation over the tongue, swirled through the mouth, and easing to soft and smooth on the finish, leaving the warmth and rich flavour on the finish.
D + Notes: An excellent beer, and unfortunate to only have one bottle. It drinks incredibly smooth and soft, with an excellent sense of satisfaction after a glass. It has certainly secured a place among the best of the best, and well worth seeking out to try. Almost frighteningly drinkable, and perhaps the closest thing to perfection that I have had the opportunity to taste. 1,476 charactersProteus93, May 11, 2008

Pours a beautiful dark maroon color! I cant believe how beautiful this rich, dark , and inviting beer is. The monks got this right!
The smell from the bottle is a little boozy and full of dark fruits. Plum, grape, and raisins make up this bouquet of a brew!
Okay, now on too the taste. I seriously can not wait to try this again! wait for it...wow, this is so drinkable. It has a very nice fruit and nut flavor! Prunes, grapes and cashews make up the taste! It does have a boozy taste however its incredibly drinkable!
PS no special occasion I just couldn't wait any longer!
Thanks to bassmantin for sharing this brew. 
The appearance was a dark prune color with minimal head. The smell was sweet and complex. As for the taste...mmmm, exotic fruits and a warm, yet subtle, alcohol taste made this brew a classy beer. 
The mouth-feel was lite and delicious. I really enjoy this beer. I've never been a huge fan of Belgian brews because of the headaches they cause me but this beer is amazing. 
I enjoy this beer. Get it. It will last forever! 1,068 charactersiconoklaztor, May 08, 2008

appearance: pours a surprisingly clear amber into a red wine glass. 
nice head gives way to some small lacing. The second pour is much more thick and cloudy, more yeast in this half. 
smell: a very wonderful smell of figs and rum. sugar coated raisins come to mind as well.
taste: a blend of smooth alcohol, and warm brown sugars. Figs again come to mind. It's sweet, but in the perfect way, it's not cloying at all. The alcohol gives it great balance, and there is some hop dry bitterness there as well. Masterfully crafted. 
mouthfeel: light going down, and yet has the right amount of body to sail perfectly over the tongue. 
Drinkabilty: through the charts, it's hard to set this one down. On the other hand it's certainly a sipper. 
The legendary Westy lives up to its reputation. It's a bit sad to think I won't be able to try this one again for some time, but good old St. Bernardus can keep me company in the meantime. 1,008 characterspjwilson, May 08, 2008
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sampled at the Tampa BA gathering 5/5/08. I think I'd had this one before but it has been a very long time. Pours a tawny, cloudy, light brown color with thin head of dense bubbles. Medium retention. Aroma displays very nice complexity - fruit, light spice, malt sweetness, even the slight essence of juicy fruit gum. The flavor builds on the notes in the nose. Brown sugar, carmel, light cinnamon, with dark fruit essences. Alcohol is well hidden beneath it all. The key is the wonderful balance of all of them - sweetness, bitterness, and fruitiness all interplay wonderfully. 
Reviewing the beer long rated #1 here brings mixed feelings. Certainly it is an excellent beer, but I also believe there are some better ones out there, and my scores on this and those beers reflect that. Then again, it's all about individual tastes and how they reflect on a common scoring system. Any true conniseur knows there really is no #1 - there is a grouping of world class beers and this one belongs in the upper echelons of that group. 'Nuff said. 1,039 charactersmarksto, May 06, 2008

S - Not as overwhelming as I thought it would be. Excellent balance of nuttiness, malt sweetness, spice, yeast, and a hint of alcohol thrown in.
T - Incredibly well balanced taste but more mild than I anticipated. Sweet malts giving a nice caramel taste as well as a nutty flavor. Some clove spice taste as well followed by a hint of alcohol. Very busy beer on the pallete.
M/D - Creamy, almost chewy and full bodied. The only thing keeping it from beeing a 5.0 for drinkability is the alcohol content. 677 charactersckeegan04, May 06, 2008

Cap best by date-9/05/2010
Appearance: It pours a dark, nut brown color. It's a very nice looking color. It's hazy, but there's some light getting through. The head is off-white and only about a finger and half deep. It's surprisingly smaller than I expected. It's not a negative, just somewhat uncharacteristic from my prior experiences with the style. Perhaps I was a little too careful with the pour. Head disappeared pretty quickly and left a light coat of lace lining the glass.
Smell: Frankly it's a little too light in this department to warrant elite status. It's certainly sweet smelling. There's a nice caramel malt aroma. Light toasted nut and raisin scents blend well. It features the typical Belgian yeastiness that's common in beers of its origin. Alcohol is slightly noticeable though far from strong.
Taste: To be fair, there's loads more flavor here than the nose would suggest. It has an excellent, sweet caramel malt base. It's got a sugary element that adds to its sweetness. Dark fruit flavors are complex. There's a bit of raisin, plum, and prune. But, they're blended extremely well and don't overpower the other flavors. They clearly play a complementary role. The Belgian yeast flavor is apparent. There's a bit of light spice flavor, but it's very subtle. Alcohol is not noticeable in taste. It's very complex and flavorful. Frankly, it's excellent but falls short of perfect. 
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It features a nice medium bodied feel. Carbonation is obviously high, but it works very well. This is an extremely smooth beer. Drinkability is very high given its fine flavor and smooth feel. At 10.2%, abv is high, but drinkability is not limited at all. Each drink leaves you wanting more. I'm not sure a beer this big could be any more drinkable. That element is clearly exceptional.
Wow! So this is it. The best beer in the world. What do I think? Well, no doubt it's good. Damn good. Worthy of many of its accolades. Personally, I wouldn't crown it the best beer in the world. Honestly it's perhaps only slightly better than other Quads held in very high regard. I mean, very slightly. That being said, I think a slight beefing up in the aroma and a bump in the spice flavor would be a slight improvement. But, those are very minor criticisms. This is damn fine beer that every BA should have the privilege of trying. 2,430 charactersprototypic, May 02, 2008

Poured a dark brown with lighter colored hues on around the edges. A large one inch light tan head sits on top of the beer and leaves a great bit of lacing around the glass. 
The aroma is quite nice. A bit of alcohol, but some delicious dark ripe fruits of plums and raisins. There is a fairly strong malt profile and slightly sweet.
The taste truly is incredible with a remarkable aftertaste. Taste of sweet ripe fruits, plums and dates. This is followed by a very malty finish, most noteably caramel flavors. Maybe even a little pepper at times?
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and incredibly creamy. The carbonation is perfect with a slight tingle in the mouth.
Drinkability is moderate to high. The incredible flavors are easy to consume, and beer is very smooth. The alcohol is hidden very well too. However, the high alcohol limit consumption of tihs beer. All the same, if I could drink this beer with no consequences then I would probably do it all day long. A true work of art and a pleasure. Although I don't think I'll ever end my quest for the perfect beer, this has taken me several steps closer. 1,237 charactersGoliath, Apr 26, 2008

I am not as favorable towards those [or ultra hoppy] beers as many of my BA brethren. So, it was with some interest that I finally broke a couple of bottles of Westy 12 out for our anniversary...
Poured into a Westy chalice. Pours a beautiful dark brown that when held up to the light is actually an amazing ruby color. I finger creamy light brown head. Opaque. Excellent lacing. Just an amazing beer to look at.
Aroma is slightly sweet and very malty. Some wood, nuts and dark fruit come through. Nice.
Taste is malty, woody and some nice spices. Also some molasses and a wonderful leather/earthy taste. Lots of flavor and very well balanced. Complex, but melded together beautifully.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very, very creamy. Nice.
Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised that the hype for this beer is all true! This is the real deal. From top to bottom, this is just excellent. Amazing balance, complexity and smoothness. I don't know if it is the best beer in the world, but it is truly outstanding. 1,084 charactersatigerlife, Apr 24, 2008

A = Very dark mahogany brown with a light tan frothy, foamy head, also some medium sized bubbles mixed in the head. Great retention.
S = Black pepper, licorice, fresh baked cinnamon sweetrolls, bittersweet chocolate, very complex. Slight burn of the alcohol in my nose but the smells were so good that was barely an after thought.
T = Taste is very closely associated with the smells. I get black pepper, licorice, sweet maple syrup, tart bittersweet chocolate, prunes, dates, figs, more chocolate but still with some hops bitterness, all very complex. Good long finish, too. I noticed the alcohol taste even less than in the smell but there was a definite burn on the tongue.
M = Medium-heavy bodied, good level of carbonation, present and frothy but not in the way, very good mouthcoating, alcohol was maybe a little hot on the tongue after a few drinks.
D = High drinkability, very tasty and warming. A great choice for a relaxing beer in the evening. 1,021 charactersTraquairlover, Apr 23, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally, the holy grail of beer. Poured from the 0.33 liter brown glass bottle into my straight sided glass beer tumbler. The very dark amber head is rocky and uneven. It slowly dissapates as the beer disappears. The beer is a murky reddish brown color. Aroma is of straw and hop. The taste is where all of the action is. Taste is of raisins, coffee, candy sugar and toffee. Very predominate malt with just the right amount of hop balance. Mouthfeel is just right for the style. The drinkability is also just right, you won't be drinking a 12 pack of this beer. Thanks to a son in the air force stationed in europe, I was able to enjoy the beer that is revered as the best in the world. I'm going to revisit St. Bernardus Abt 12, available locally, and compare.
If you can lay your hands on a bottle, spare no expense, in my opinion, it lives up to the hype.
Just a thought,

4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I'm finally reviewing this beer that I've had sitting around for months and months. Thanks to Floydster for the chance to try it. I'm a big fan of quads in general, and especially the Trappist ones. So far my benchmark for the style has been Rochefort 10, which I like a deal better than the St. Bernardus 12. What I like about the Rochefort 10 as compared to the St. Bernardus is the nice spicy hop finish and lingering bitterness wheras I find the abt 12 to be a good deal breadier and maltier. Both have exceptional balance, but I also like the Rochefort's more sustained fruit as compared to the St. Bernardus's creamier finish. I had expected the Westvleteren 12 to be more like the St. Bernardus in flavor given its history and all of the comments about it over the years. At least in these three beers current incarnations, I finf the Westvleteren 12 and the Rochefort 1o to be much more similar than either is to the abt 12. I can't say that I like the Wewstvletern better than the Rochefort, but they are both exquisite beers.
This beer pours dark chestnut with a very tightly knit head that soon settles to a thin ring and leaves some spotty lacing. The clarity is better on this beer than the Rochefort, but the head is not as magnificent. Beautifully balanced malt aromas with quite a bit of dark fruit and a hint of spun sugar. The taste is exceptional with beautifuly balanced sweet malt, dark fruit, and spicy hops. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy, maybe a bit more so than the Rochefort and has a tannic edge to it rather than being super creamy. Regardless, this is a pleasure to drink and parse its flavors and if I had another one I'd crack it right now. 1,674 charactersGeorgiabeer, Apr 19, 2008

It's pours a dark, slightly hazy brown with a thin tan head. The aroma has a hint of cardboard, but otherwise its smooth, Belgian chocolate with a hint of fruit. The flavors going on in the beer are nuts. I'm blown away by the complexity. Just running down the list of flavors in my notes I got: chocolate (lots of it), grassy/herbal hops, caramel, candi sugar, medjool dates (really sweet dates), and cola. Everything is very smooth and one flavor melts into the next. 
I tried to be skeptical, but this truly is divine beer. I had this back to back with the St. Bernardus 12, but there's not much comparison. The Bernardus is lighter in color and thus has more fruity flavors than chocolate. I love Bernardus, but if Westy 12's were just as available, it'd be my go-to. 861 characterstempest, Apr 19, 2008

Color was a darker brown color with a slight hint of reds. When held to light you could see that it was slightly clear, not as cloudy as I had anticipated. Head was decent, nothing notable however.
Smelled very good. You could certainly smell some fruits and sugars, some alcohol, and some yeast. Also smelled a little of honey and cane sugar.
Delicious! Perfect blend of malts and hops. Could definetely taste the sugars - high quality tasting sugars - and the fruits.
The mouthfeel to me was amazing. It was a very smooth drink, almost felt as though you were drinking - now picture this - a very diluted and carbonated milkshake. Not too thick but not too thin. Felt like heaven.
Awesome beer. I wish it wasn't so hard to come by as I would certainly have it on hand regularly. Great treat though. Is it the best in the world? For me so far it has been one of my favorites. 1,102 charactersTStandley13, Apr 18, 2008

Poured a rich, dark brown color into a chalice. However, when the light hit it just right, it had a deep ruby/garnet glow. Wasn't a huge head, but stayed around for a while. Also, we were sharing this among several people, so pouring this bottle into multiple glasses may have affected the head size as well.
Aromas were good, but nothing really stood out. Rather fruity, like plums and brown sugar, with some sweetness as well.
The taste was excellent. Lots of dark fruits, honey, some spice, and also a bit of alcohol bitterness.
Mouthfeel was exceptiona, like drinking velvet. Just a tingle of carbonation to keep the palate fresh.
Overall, this was a great beer. Did it live up to the hype--could it live up to the hype? Hard to say. I would love to have another full glass rather than the portion I had in order to really savor and explore this beer. But I can't say that I was dissappointed, either, because what I did get to sample was awesome. 1,087 charactersdoppelmeup, Apr 14, 2008

A - A very dark plum colored beer that has a hint of amber on it. A small pale white head sits on top and there is a ton of carbonation floating up through this one. Definitely one of the darkest beers I've ever seen of this style.
S - Not at all a big nose but one that has a lot to it. There is a hint of orange and lemon mixed in as well with a ruby port. Also have a hint of raisins and dates that add in the dark flavors. 
T- As I taste this, it is not a beer that really blows you away after you put it in your mouth but what makes this beer so great is that it is so complex. There is a ton of dark fruit, plums and dates, a bit biscuit and bready flavor. A hint of anise also sticks out, plus a hint of lemon and orange. In the end, get a little bit of a whiff of the alchy as well that wells up and attacks yah.. The thing is that everything is there but perfectly balanced. Has a hint of port flavors as well.
MF - has a big and bready mouthfeel. Also a nice creamy aspect that helps it go down super smooth. The aftertaste is a light tingling feeling but not too much. Have to say I was impressed by how creamy the MF was on this beer especially given all the carbonation that one sees in it.
D - Overall, this was a good and easy drinking especially for 10% ABV. It was a great drinker but i don't know if it was the hype or what but I wasn't super impressed. This is a good beer that really stands out because it has so much flavor that is all so balanced. Nothing really pops out and it is not what I'd consider a wow flavor beer but it has so much complexity in such a package. Can't wait to get another one if I can. 1,706 charactersjeonseh, Apr 14, 2008

Thanks to DrSeamus.
A: Poured like cola. Slightly off white off white head. Tons of lacing.
S: Malt sugar and grapes. The spice looms larger than on the 8. The yeast is nice and strong.
T: This is the best Belgian I have ever had hands down. The taste is so complex that every sip yields something different. Earthy taste in there as well. There are a few things in there that I cannot even pick up on but this was incredible.
M: So smooth. The 8 might have been a little more drinkable but this was drinkable. So creamy and wonderful. Slight dryness just like the 8.
D: Like the 8 this is an incredibly drinkable. No hint of the ABV at all. Some of the hyped beers let you down but this one does not. Makes me wish I would I lived in Belgium. Drink this one if you can. 795 charactersaerozeppl, Apr 14, 2008

Again, huge kudos to drseamus for sharing this on such a beautiful day.
A- Dark cola brown with slight tan head. Residual head does not cap the surface like on the 8. Light spidery lacing.
S- Rich malts, Belgian candi sugar and grapes. There's also a buttery/spiciness hanging out. Very rich. 
T- Up-front taste is similar to the nose with rich malts, candi sugar and wine(ish). As it warms the body develops more complexity with notes of caramel, toffee, dates and raisins. The alcohol presence is subdued but leaves a definite warming feeling. The spicy flavors in the body & finish... This is where I cannot put my finger on the tastes. It could just be the yeast, but its this presence that takes this beer from really good to phenomenal. Jayzus, even the burps taste really freakin' delicious.
M- Medium bodied with an ideal amount of tingly carbonation. The body is so creamy and smooth finishing with a crisp and brandy-like dryness.
D- Oye! Amazingly good. This really lived up to the hype. I don't really know what more I could say that hasn't been said by other reviewers. 1,107 charactersAvryle, Apr 13, 2008

11.2 ounce bottle, cap stamped with 30.08.09. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a dark murky brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like dark fruit (plums, raisins), caramel, bananas, pepper, cloves and yeast. Taste is pretty similar to the aroma, with the addition of licorice, nuts, chocolate and some booziness too. It seems a different flavor comes out with each sip. Very tasty! Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and a bit syrupy and slick, and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. The alcohol warming does kick in after a while, but that's not a bad thing. I think this is an excellent beer. I don't think it's worth the price to buy it all the time, but it's definitely worth it to get a couple bottles just to try it because it's not easy to get. I wasn't disappointed, that's for sure! 989 charactersbluejacket74, Apr 13, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle served at 45 degrees F in a Duvel tulip. 
My first bottle of Westy 12 was many years ago and it was shared and sampled after many other beers. Needless to say, I barely remember it! This time I have a bottle all to myself.
Decants a rusty leather brown with slightly hazy garnet edges. Dense finger of gauzy, cobwebby, slightly uneven dirty khaki head. Good lacing up the sides of the glass.
Complex nose of caramelized dark fruits, musty-sweet vinous grapes, molasses, blackberries, ripe bananas, sweet tobacco, brandy, and yeast. A great smelling beer, that just gets better as it warms.
The taste actually surpasses the complexity and beauty of the aromas. Brown sugary dark fruits greet the tongue accompanied by a slightly tangy grape character. Dates, figs, and very ripe grape sweetness fills up the palate. Caramel cookie dough around the edges. Mild roasted bitterness and tobacco join in the finish complimenting the sweetness perfectly. Yeasty, subtle alcohol presence is slightly warming. Fruit, cookie dough, and grape sweetness linger for what seems like hours. Full-bodied with an amazingly smooth and creamy feel.
Exceptionally drinkable, especially for its strength. Wow. No let down here! Truly one of the greatest beers ever made.
Vinous with a slightly roasted yeasty quality overall makes for a sublime taste experience. 1,354 charactersalexgash, Apr 12, 2008

 11.2 oz brown bottle (no lable) > Chimay goblet
 Westy pours out dark-brown-ish amber color,
 ruby hues and almost opaque. The head is a fluffy, creamy but very active and bubbly, mocha-frothe color that stands about 2" high. This clearly has good carbonation due to the head retention, but it's hard to see through the dark body. There is huge and very sticky clumps of lacing all over the glass as the volume goes down.
 The aroma is very pungent and very unique. Right off, I'm getting...rollo's candies, chocolate covered dates, slightly sour red grapes, black berries, green bean and herb scented hops with some whiff's of wet cedar wood. The malt is most dominant with light chocolate and caramel scent's. Sweet but earthy.
 The first thing you notice when you take the first sip is the massively complex, slick and creamy malt flavor. Classic candied sugar sweetness with really amazing depth. There's honey-covered prunes and dates with overly-ripe red concord grapes then comes a layer of caramel and light chocolate. Sure the malt is a marvel but it's really the sublime balance that impresses me most, with an herbal and slightly spicey hop kick and subtle tangy yeast. The 10.2% ABV is just the right amount of heat, not over-powering but a bit sharp which actually adds further complexity right at the end. I love big-ass malt-bombs so naturally this one is right down my alley.
 The feel is certainly full-bodied with a luxurious slick and creamy feel, but lively too....classic for the style.
 I simply didn't want to see the end of this stuff, I sipped slowly and it still disapeared quicker than I had wanted. This is a masterpiece of brewing. 1,732 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Apr 11, 2008

Aromas get better as beer warms. Taste is wow! This is really 12%? I get a nice malty kidk right off the bat with tons of different flavors around my mouth. i swear I feel taste buds going crazy on the roof of my mouth even!

4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Two glorius bottles from my good chum in England. 
One I am reviewing now, the other I will cellar for as long as I can hold out resisting. 
Pulled out of the fridge 10 minutes ago. Poured into matching Westvleteren goblet.
Silky smooth beige head that falls to a whispy lacing. Dark brown in color, with the faintest highlights through the light murk. 
Tea in the nose at first. It's still a tad cooler in temperature than I would prefer it, but not bad. Honey and aromatic lemon and floral notes. 
Smooth! One of the most interesting textures in a beer that i've had. A coating of carbonation hits the tounge, and rolls around the mouth, opening up my tastebuds for the flavors to follow. Alcohol soaked raisins, figs, barley, and yeast in the opening. THen a spicy honey caramel finsish. It leaves a dry, yet sticky taste in the mouth. A real treat. 
The mouthfeel, as smooth as it is, makes this one incredibly drinkable. I've been sipping at this my whole review and as it warms up, it gains complexity and depth. 
I wouldn't put this one necessarily above some other trappist beers that I've had, but the accessibility makes this the rare treat. The mere fact that the quanities and availability are limited, makes me not at all surprised this is 'the' BA favorite. 1,278 charactersSurlyDuff, Apr 04, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 411.2 oz. bottle "Belgian-poured" into a tulip glass by the very knowledgeable bartender. Murky, brown appearance with a thick tan head that dissipates slowly leaving lacing. Aroma of dates, prunes, caramel and malts. Very complex flavor including hints of prunes, brown sugar, hazelnut and malt. Finishes slightly sweet. Served at room temperature, it could have used to been cooled slightly (the bottle indicated 54-58 degrees F). Heavy mouthfeel, meant for sipping. Good drinkability regardless, but at $12 a bottle it is unlikely that I'll be getting this very often. I would echo the sentiments that this is not the "Best Beer in the World" but that is quite an expectation to live up to. 692 charactersTheBCrew, Mar 31, 2008

I need to preface my review by stating that I really do not like doubles and trippels, however, I had to try this one due to its reviews on this site. I don't know the vintage of the bottle I have.
Appearance: Pours cloudy amber brownish with a huge long lasting tan head.
Smell: Smells of malts and caramel. No hop aroma
Taste: Tastes almost wineish. I taste cherry flavors as well as some roasted or caramel flavors which I have not tasted before. Acoholic flavors also present in the finish
Mouthfeel: Very heavy beer. Alcoholic in the back of the throat. Pleasant on the palate.
Drinkability: Drinkable beer, moreso than other strong belgium beers I have tried. Great beer but it is not the "Best in the world" 770 charactersSquelch, Mar 26, 2008
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had the honor of sampling this popular item the other night as I was guided through my first beer brewing experience by a very generous friend who shared his last bottle of this liquid gold. Poured a rich chestnut-brown w/ruby-amber edges where light permeated through. Head thin and light beige. The aroma was complex, but dominated by chocolate character and various toasted malts, with lighter scents of a bouquet of spices and light herbs, light esters, and warming alcohol. The taste was exceptional--chocolate malt, molasses and candy sugar, an exotic blend of rich spices, and a strong finish of cocoa and alcohol rounded out by bitter hops. There was also an inexplicable bite at the back of the midpalate that was actually quite pleasant, but I don't know what it was. Very light carbonation, rich body that consistently delivers throughout the palate, and harmonious balance between a very dry texture and the sweet and spice flavors forge a powerful result. 968 charactersBoitSansSoif, Mar 23, 2008
4.58/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Popping the top as my beerthday present to me. Pours a deep dark hazy bubbly brown, the color of honey fresh from a comb around the edges. The initial smell is...beer - fairly straightforward malty, slightly musty scent with a couple bolder notes of clove and cinamon around backing up the basics. The fairly simple nose belies the rich, complex flavors that greet the tongue. A fairly neutral, caramel malt starts things off, then the taste gets big. I can't even begin to chart the unfolding of the various flavors that appear, but its big on deep red, not overly sweet bing cherries, dark but not terribly bitter chocolate, crisp but not too bright macintosh apples, along with some prickly pear, clove, cinamon, raisin, course ground white pepper... and on and on. Balance is the key word here. Roling this around on the tongue, I'm faintly picking up the mineral bitterness I'd noticed and somewhat faulted in the Westy 8, but here its quite well hidden. And so is the alcohol, which adds some depth to the flavors but sneaks in like ninja. I suppose silent like a monk would be more apropos, but ninja sounds more dramatic, and like the alcohol content, ass kicking.
The mouthfeel is thick and chewy yet still pretty heavily carbonated, keeping things paradoxically light. My tounge's feeling a little dry after a bit, but I'll man up and soldier on, poor me. For a quad, holy crap this is quaffable. Just wonderfully balanced and subtly flavorful. 
Is this a world class beer? Absolutely. Is it the best thing I've ever tasted? I certainly enjoyed it a great deal, but I'm afraid the answer is no, there are other things more pleasing to my palate. But who cares about the hype, it's a lovely drink and I'm pleased as punch, or I guess pleased as really good beer, to be drinking it.

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Picked up four bottles from JonPol the AJ's beer guy in early February 2008 for $20/bottle. Happy birthday to me! The yellow cap date is 18.12.10.
Been saving this up for the right time so with this being a blustury 60 degree day in Phoenix I figured to need a warmer upper :)
Beer poured a burgundy color with a tan long lasting one finger head. Nose is wonderful, of bananas, dark fruits, and chocolate. Taste is what i was anticipating, perfection! Started with sweet malts accentuated by bananas, blended with a hint of cherry chocolate, finishing with a perfectly blended dry hop. Mouthfeel is perfect as well. The medium bodied brew glided seemlessly from the front to the back of my tounge. Drinkability is perfect as well. There is not a trace of alcohol that is noticeable from start to finish. I had to admit I was a bit skeptical coming in but in the end I have to say this is the best beer I have had to date!
Sampling same batch as of 2-27-10(#3 of 4): Nose is complex as it was two years ago - bananas, dark fruits dominate. Taste is more wine like, detecting less of the banana yeast notes and getting more hints of red wine and hints of chocolate. It is sweeter but definitely not cloying. The mouthfeel is still velvety smooth and still perfectly drinkable - no alcohol detected. 1,299 charactersarizcards, Mar 17, 2008

This was my reward after a 20 mile training run for my next marathon. The beer was sampled In De Vrede across the road from the Sint-Sixtusabdij...
Appearance: Brown in color, about a half inch off-white head that does dissipate relatively quickly, but leaves an impeccable lace on the glass. Ruby tones are brought out by the light.
Aroma: Very sweet smell, hints of caramel and the spiciness of the yeast. Alcohol comes through a bit, its volatility serves to bring out even more aromas (toffee, cherries, and slight smoke).
Flavor & Mouthfeel: Body is lighter than I've experienced for a quad (and that's a very good thing) and more bitter than typical of Belgians in general. Bitterness balances the malt and sweet caramel tastes. Again, cherries come through a bit in the taste, as well as a smoky, burnt toffee character.
Drinkability: For its strength (10.2%), it is remarkably drinkable, I could have sat there the rest of the day and had glass after glass to replenish lost calories from the run.
If you see this available where you are, grab it without hesitation. I recommend going to Belgium, though and experiencing it in its homeland (plus there's about 1000 other breweries to try beers from over there). 1,344 charactersPartyHatjo, Mar 16, 2008

a: A murky chestnut body, big off-white head, superior retention. Body turns ruby when held to the light. 
s: Hard for me to nail down the aromas. I get notes of fruit, yeast, malt and alcohol. A bit musky. A vague description I know, but its the best I can do. It smells like a delicious quad.
t: Like Shrek, this beer has many layers. A very complex flavor profile. I can taste licorice, caramel malt, nuttiness, raisins, funky belgian yeast, alcohol, feel like I could go on and on with noticeable flavors, but I won't. Terrific balance. This beer is packed with nearly limitless flavors. The variety is mind-numbing. Every sip I take, I want to take another sip to decipher the flavor I had just detected. Had to stop myself and slow down. I'm picking up some molasses now. Cherries too?
m: Very dry. Leaves a slight puckering bitterness in the tongue. An affect of the yeast? The carbonation and body suit the beer perfectly.
d: I am convinced I could drink a case of this beer and notice something new with each bottle. A joy to drink. I am not the biggest quad guy, more a function of income than preference. But despite my naivete, I can't help but notice the excellence of this brew. Never have I had the pleasure of a beer with half as much complexity. This beer receives a lot of love on this site. This review will not alter that trend. It is a tremendous offering, the definition of what a quad should be. Oh yeah and at 10.2% it sure goes down easy. 1,521 charactersBradLikesBrew, Mar 15, 2008

Aroma is an amazing array of sweet malt and alcohol soaked dark and citrus fruit.
Taste is sweet caramel malt, and toffee up front. Generous fruit character - especially tangerine. Finish is mildy bitter with chocolate and an earthy, nutty character. A very mild yeast aspect.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Full and round.
Flavor is rich, and so smooth and unified. Alcohol is almost completely concealed. A wonderfully tasty treat. 551 charactersBlakaeris, Mar 12, 2008

Smell was full and sweet with a subtle fruits, sweet malts, and a funky spicy yeast quality all coming through.
Flavor is sweet and light with a great mixture of fruity notes, spices, and a lightly citrusy and minty bit of hops bringing it into perfect balance.
Mouthfeel is silky and creamy with a nice bit of heat and good carbonation.
Overall this is an outstanding beer, I have drank it on several occasions with some other world class beers to compare it to. I have a tough time saying its the best beer I have ever had, but have just as difficult time saying it isn't. I think it deserves a perfect score, I can't imagine a single thing here you could improve on. 805 charactersbashiba, Mar 12, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Jcone17 and I traded (big props to user: BobMexico) for two Westy 12's and two Westy 8's. The Westy 12 being the better of the two. Review:
A - poured into a goblet and I gave it some air as to produce a nice thick head, about an inch thick. The head was foamy and the color was that of sand. The head dissipated some but stuck around for the duration, with very slight lacing. The beer is dark and cloudy and has a chocolaty look to it.
S - the smell was confusing, ranging from bitter fruits (raisins) to mild fruits (banana) to chocolate to yeast. Although, I was more anxious to drink this beer rather than concentrate on the smell, but to the best of my recollection, those were the smells I remember.
T - similar to the smell, the taste is hard to pinpoint. It's very robust and complex and hides its alcohol extremely well. I know it's sort of redundant, but the initial taste is similar to that of a St. Bernardus .Abt 12, although the Westy 12 masks its alcohol much better and has a broader range of flavors. Not to mislead though, the Westvleteren 12 easily surpasses the St. Berny in flavor. To date, I have not tasted a better beer.
M - the beer is very smooth with a slight dry finish. Again, the most similar comparison is the St. Berny 12, although the Berny has more carbonation feel to it, where as the Westy replaces that with more of an oily feel. It has a perfect brief aftertaste, leaving me wanting more. "The Holy Grail" of beer? Nah, more like "The crack cocaine of beer", I just kept wanting more... 
D - I could go on and on about this beer. I had really high expectations for it (how could you not?), and it completely delivered. To my surprise, it exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say, I will constantly be looking to get my hands on more of these... 1,788 charactersSaintNathaniel, Mar 10, 2008

I had high expectations for this "holy grail" of beers and once I received this, I put it away and tried to think of when would be the perfect time to drink it. After a combination of my own impatience and some pestering from a couple friends, I decided to put the expectations and hype to the test.
I poured this into a Chimay goblet glass.
The appearance was a brown color with a powerful but thin tan head about one finger thick slowly dissipating to a frothy skim top. It was well carbonated but not overpowering and seemed to settle down after sitting for a while.
I smelled fruits, raisins, spiciness, and sweetness such as caramel and chocolate, and dare I say, nuts of some kind. The mouthfeel was malty and creamy, a bit smoother and not as thick as St Bernardus Abt 12 but that's a good different thing. There seemed to be a slightly dry bitter finish at the very end of each sip. Complexity at it's finest!
Really a solid wonderful beer, and it didn't disappoint. 1,030 charactersbgramer, Mar 02, 2008

A: Dark redish brown and cloudy with a beautiful pillowy off white head. The head stays for a very long time (in fact it's torture because I'm waiting to drink it) There is excellent lacing as well.
S: Amazingly powerful aroma, I can smell it without putting my nose over the top. Smells almost like an aged spirit, deep complex aroma. Spicyness, and some dark sweetness as is typical of the style. It makes my mouth water.
T: I take my first sip...it just keeps on coming...the complexity of this beer is outstanding. Spice, malt sweetness, balancing bitterness, Dark fruits hit you at the end. Taking a sip is a long experience, and great each time.
M: The mouthfeel is creamy and huge. One of the best feeling beers I have ever had.
D: I can't think of a time when I would not want to keep drinking this.
This beer stood up to the hype. I'm a fan of the style and this is the holy grail. Now i know it is with good reason.
I tasted this together with St. Bernardus abt 12, and though similar, it beat it hands down. 1,127 characters51mmz0rz, Mar 01, 2008

S- Smell is amazing. Deep dark fruits, raisins, hints of plum, with a deep yeasty earthiness that is hard to describe. boozy.
T- Taste is extremely balanced and minimal yet overflowing with complexity. Starts off just as in the nose with deep dark fruits, moves into a bit of an acidic bite which mingles with a hop bitterness joined with a spicy flavor. There is a deep breadiness all the way through and booziness at the end which tops it off perfectly.
M- Thick, low on carbonation and fairly dry. Lingers on the palate for a while.
D- I wanted to dislike this beer, I really really did. I told myself I would rate it like any other and try to play down the hype but it just didn't work. The only way I can describe how good this one goes down is the spicy, warming sharpness of the finish of a good big red wine. Because of the price I won't actively seek this one out again but if i'm ever in europe and I see one you can bet that's what i'll be drinking. I usually dislike quads but this one seemed so laid back, it was a delight. 1,148 charactersLothore, Feb 28, 2008

The nose was full of dark fruits like plums,raisins,dates,and a hint of anise.
The taste has so much going on you have to step back and think what is coming at you. Big silky dark malts with soft dark fruits of raisins and plums and caramelized sugar. The mouthfeel is the best I ever had experience in a beer. So silky smooth you don't notice the high abv. except for the warming sensation. The drinkability is good has you can get for 10.2%.
I think it is hard to give a beer a 5 on this when you could only handle drinking one or two at a time in one night. This is for sure the best quadrupel ever! But My heart still remains a hophead.

this beer pours a garnet brown with a moderate light tan head, that drops to a film.
the aroma is a slightly vinous soft caramel coated grape. there are many other furits in there: pear, raspberry, a very nice juicy plum, prune, soft black cherry. i also find chocolate combined with a cereal quality, almost like the smell of special k. its also got a powdery crackery yeast characteristic.
the taste contains a rich malty caramel backed by a plethora of other complexities. the half dozen fruits from the aroma are there, leaning toward the darker earthy side of the spectrum. they remain light and not in your face though, showing a magnificent level of restraint. beyond those you find bits a pieces of chocolate, corriander, hints of clove, graham, hints of vanilla (resembling oak), an almost pecan pie type flavor, with soft light brown sugar. the 11% abv is masked in a near supernatural way... there is no trace. rounded out with it's soft powdery yeast. impeccably balanced.
the body is fullish medium, with soft moderate carbonation, that facilitates this beer gliding down your throat. slightly dry.
exceptional drinkability, balanced and beautiful, this beer is a work of art and the pinnacle of it's style. intially i had a few of the ratings at less than five, but as the bottom of the glass approaches you start to realize exactly what you have in front of you, nothing less than brewing perfection. 
this is everything it's advertised to be. 1,532 characterskmo1030, Feb 14, 2008
4.58/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2oz. brown bottle, yellow cap - no label, poured into a snifter. Best before 4.12.10
A: Pours a deep burgundy with zero visibility. Just over 1 finger of light toffee head forms and holds nicely. Bit chunks of lacing to start, then decent patching.
S: Very similar to the 8 but more intense and with a phenolic line. Very clean smelling caramel malts and plenty of boozy dark fruits.
T/M: I'm really diggin' the alcohol in this. Normally I only like an alcohol warming in my beer... when I want something stronger I'll pour some single malt. Not the case here. The alcohol adds such an amazing complexity to everything. The dark fruits pop so much better. The caramel malts are still as great as ever but with an 'adult theme' haha. The mouthfeel is just as perfect as the 8.
D: I don't typically like Belgians too much but the 8 and 12 are definitely worthy. I won't call this my favorite beer but I'd never argue with someone for saying it's theirs. 958 characterspwoods, Feb 11, 2008

11.2 oz brown bottle without a logo... Finally got this one... Yellow cap with Westvleteren logo and the two words "bevat" and "BIER", including 10,2% VOL....
Appearance = Deep, dark mahogany brown with a frothy tan head that lingered for a bit.
Smell = Very malty aroma, loaded with figs, prunes, malts, and caramel.
Taste = Very thick, rich, and full-flavored taste that strongly complements the aroma... dominated by malts, dehyrdrated fruits, caramel, slight vanilla and sweet, candied sugars... Alcohol is difficult to detect behind a rich combination of thick flavors.
Mouthfeel = Extremely creamy, thick, rich, and full mouthfeel... the taste lingers on your tongue for a while after the first sip... 
Drinkability = Good drinkability despite the hefty 10.2% ABV... As mentioned before, alcohol is difficult to detect...
 Overall, yes, this is a world-class, top-notch beer, but it is certainly not the best that I've ever tried...
For a good equivalent to this one, try 
St. Bernardus Abt 12 or Trappist Achel Extra... 1,045 charactersdsa7783, Feb 08, 2008

a - poured a three-fingers thick bubbly and fizzy light tan head into a tulip glass. it left thick lace and sheeting throughout, really coats the glass. the body was a dark and heavy brown with hints of purple.
s - very comples, smells of plums, raisins and other dark fruits with hints of caramel.
t - so much going on here, vanilla, honey, fruit, with a caramel malt sweetness.
m - this is perfection. so smooth and creamy.
d - what a wonderful sipper, goes down easily and one could get carried away with this if not careful. 567 charactersGPHarris, Feb 05, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked up a bottle at the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam, along with the 8. They were serving them both across the street at Cafe Gollem, but with such a sought after beer, we couldn't have our first taste of the Westvleterens after knocking back a few other belgian treats. I enjoyed the 8 a few nights ago and have been looking forward to cracking open the 12.
Opened the bottle and had a whiff of of sweet carmel. Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass. The beer is dark in color and has small bubbles making the head hardly noticeable. The beer is almost the color of Coca-Cola, and as I folded in one part Coca-Cola, the two beverages blended seamlessly, and I knew I would be in for a great treat. 
Just kidding, I can't even imagine adding Coca-Cola to a sub-par kölsch, though that's what all the cool kids do here in Cologne. 
This beer is extremely aromatic, sweet and complex. With such a strong sweet smell, I expected a much sweeter taste. Certainly a sweetness does run through your mouth, but it's mild and not at all overwhelming, perhaps tempered by its remarkable smoothness. After gulping down a sip, a dark toasted flavor lingers, which can be detected while the beer's still in your mouth, but really comes to the front in a nonetheless complex aftertaste. Not much of an alcohol warming feel with this one, but I really didn't miss it because of, again, the ridiculous smoothness.
This beer surpassed any expectations I had, high as they were. The discussions about the beer started strong, but in the end we were simply too distracted by the deliciousness of this beverage to talk. Finished it pretty quickly, as each tasted prompted another. Had there been another bottle in our refrigerator, I'm sure it would not be there this morning. It may be time to start planning that trip to visit the monks. 1,831 charactersjellycabbage, Feb 05, 2008

Thanks to Josh from Vintage Wine and Beer for the birthday hookup, very cool my friend.
Two months I have stared at the bottle with the gold cap, almost frightened to open it. Afraid of the effect it would have on me. I mean, Belgian Quads are my favorite and this is widely known not only as the pinnicle of that genre, but of beer in general. Well, its Super Sunday, and the hated, cheating Patriots are on their way to a SB victory, this Steeler fan needs something to make me smile.
A--A little lighter than the Rochefort but similar lacing and retention. Carbonation seems to be very prevelent in this brew. Pretty sweet.
S--I smell a very complex and remarkable beer. Cherries seem to be most noticeable. Definitely candied sugars are there. So much going on with this brew.
T--Wow. Hard not to be let down by this considering the rarity and considerable notoriety. However, it holds up very well. Little metallic due to the relative freshness of the beer. This is still one terrific beer. This is a really complex beer, so many flavors and I love it. 
M--Silky smooth.
D--Well, what can you say, it is Westvletaren. Unfortunately, you are about as likely to win the lottery than to have this beer at your disposal. $450 a case?? That makes it pretty tough. IF I could have this beer regularly, I would. Though I have to say it will definitely hit you with its whopping ABV. A question any Belgian fan needs to ask is how does this brew compare to its most celebrated cousins, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus ABT 12? It holds up quite nicely. Know this, this is the best beer in the world, hands down. I dont know what is more depressing, that the Pats will likely win today or that my goblet is almost gone. 1,735 charactersgarbercury, Feb 03, 2008
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My first bottle was consumed fresh... it was only about a month old. It had a metallic after taste to it. Still wonderful but not great. My second was aged for 6 months and it made all the difference in the world.
Appearance: Rich brown with a white lace head. Stunning in the Westvleteren goblet.
Smell: Sweet malts... honey... raisen... sour dough bread.
Taste: Orgasmic. I can't even begin to give this brew a proper description of taste... But I will try. Sweet, bready and malty with an after taste of raisin or fruit and spices.
Mouthfeel: Smooooth as a babies ars. Perfect carbonation level. Perfect consistency.
Drinkability: Do you really need to ask? If only I lived somewhere near the monastery... I'd have my fridge filled with them... Sadly I am down to just two bottles.
This is perfection. 810 charactersMayorAdamWest, Feb 01, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I feel honored to make my first beer review the one and only Trappist Westvleteren 12. The beer Gods shot from the bottle like Raiders of The Lost Ark. Poured out of an 11.2 oz brown bottle with gold cap, and no label.
Apperance - soft white lacing coats the sides of the glass, and clings beautifully.
Smell - Wondeful aroma. Plum, honey, and a bready aroma dance around the nose.
Taste - Smooth mouthful. Taste of sweet malts and breadyness, with a spicy alcohol taste the sneaks up on you. Finishes wonderfully with a slight fruity taste at the back of the tounge.
West 12 trumps any Belgian I have ever had. Honored to be one of the rare few who has had the opportunity to have it pass through my lips. Got 5 more bottles, so i'm dying to see what will await me in two to three years when I open the next bottle. I can only imagine the taste after it's been cellared a few years. 887 charactersryrust5301, Jan 24, 2008
4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5July 24, 2009: Along with the notes below, the cotton candy/confection/powdered sugar flavor is super clean and full of taste. Ester profile shows more grape flavors than I remember. An immaculate beer fit for it's #1 status.
So, this is the daddy of all daddyies; the penacle of all fermented malty beverages; the beer that carries the biggest kahunas; the most elusive and sought-after beer of all. Can a beer possibly live up to it's legendary status? Yes in fact, it can. A very deep, strong, agressive berry and candied aroma swells from the bottle, even before the pour. The beer pours neatly into the chalice with a rising pillow of foam that brings out more dark berries, dehydrated fruits, and tart, warming alcohols. Very mouth-watering and inviting. That first sip brings a lot of that rich berry flavor (blackberries, cranberries, raspberries, and a hint of grapes) that shines above a seriously malt base. Pecans, almonds, and graham cracker flavors display the malts well. Dehydrated / candied fruits (cherries, pineapples, dates and figs) meld with a sweet rum-like alcohol flavor and makes this beer some of the better flavors ever placed into my mouth. The body shows all of the firm-ness, viscity, and creaminess needed for a perfect-five beer, but the alcohols and berry-vineous flavors slice through it, making it waver just a bit. The berry flavor lingers on and on... I can still taste it from last night. It is easy to see why this beer so easily seduces even the most seasoned beer enthusiest, but I have to ask it to reluctantly step aside of this grand pedistal for its little brother, Westvleteren Dubbel.

4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let me start off by saying that I am not really worthy. Nor am I truly qualified to review this beer. Started off pouring this beauty into a snifter at 60F. It poured with a nice three fingers of tan, tight bubbles that dissipated rather quickly, leaving a gorgeous lacing which I am sure would have revealed the future in the hands of a skilled fortune teller. Smelled the obvious sweet maltiness, combined with a fine boot leather most worthy of any fetishist's attention. A slightly alcoholic cream soda came to mind as well. The taste hit me with a heavy sweet and cloying bombardment that didn't yield anything too unusual. Those fig trays with a spiral pattern and the fork in the middle. The first drag of a Marlboro Red was also present; not that I smoke 'em anymore. The carbonation was sublime as it presented the tiniest bed of nails to roll around on while enjoying this sweet beauty. The finish is quite lovely bittersweet, with a faint hop presence and a Jagermeisterish herb sensation low on the Pallete. End of the journey and the lacing is still on high where it started, and so am I. The 10.2 has shown its face as I wonder how on earth I will manage to keep my hands off the other two bottles I have. I think the lacing is now part of my little snifter as though it were painted on.
Update: Oh god, this stuff is so good. I am praying for forgiveness as I buy all I can get. 1,394 characterskorndog, Jan 18, 2008

Tasted of fruits and spices. Some alcohol present but blended in very well.
Very smooth and rich, with some carbonation present.

Pours a brown/amber color with slight haze and ruby highlights. The nose is very fruity with some sour tones maybe cherry, and some spice. Smell almost champagnish (slightly kindof maybe a little) Nice white/off white head dissipates fairly fast. Wow!! intense dark fruit flavors. plums, raisins, figs, dates, black cherry wowwwowowowow!! Awesome spice and smoothness! damn smooth! I see what all the hype is about, this beer is great. The finish is smooth as hell and the mouthfeel is bomb. Drinkability is very dangerous as the alcohol on the finish is about as minimal as you can get with a quad, but still a great warming effect in the stomach. Awesome beer!!! Get it if you can. props to the monks. 738 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Jan 08, 2008
4.78/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This review is for my virtual mug! I have been holding off on this awesome brew for that special occaision. 
A- Milk chocolate brown with light browinsh 1" film on top surface after a conservative pour. Lacing is shimmery like glitter on the sides of the glass. Nice floaties in the glass, but most was left in the bottle, leaving 3/4" of beer and sediment behind.
S- Plums, cherries and sour tones with roasted malts well blended throughout. After warming a bit, I pick up the darker side with chocolates and raisins. Buttery too.
T- Chocolate, caramel, and same dark fruits. The chocolate and caramel really come out after warming it a bit. The alcohol is nice and warming. You know you have a real beer when you drink this one. 
M- Medium mouthfeel with high carbonation. Stingy all over the tongue. Very nice.
D- Alcohol taste and warming keeps it from a perfect score, but still very high.
Overall- From the look, to the smell, to the taste, to the feel, just a bad ass beer. I see what the fuss is about and I am glad to try it, and also glad to try more. I feel that this particular beer is a little young, and will only get better with age. 1,154 charactersMMAJYK, Jan 07, 2008
4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I bought this bottle along with 5 friends back in October from E-bay and waited until the New Year for the sampling. Had this on New Years Eve and it was exquisite. 
Poured into a oversized wine glass as that's the closest I had to a goblet. The tan head was extreme and fell slowly. The smell was rich in fruits, spices, just a hint of biscuity malts and a piney hops (very subtle). The taste lived up to the expectation. This is not a beer you drink by the gulp that's for sure. The taste was as big as the smell and lived up to everything I thought it would be..very complex..it started off to me with a immediate alcohol warmth and taste of roasted barley and biscuits and then flowered into a nice thick fig and raisin taste and finished with a bite of hops that was subtle but cut the fruity tastes. 
Overall this was a great beer and surely one of the best on the planet. I don't think I would even call it my favorite and if I never get to try another again I'm glad I got one shot and giving it a try 1,011 charactersmeechum, Jan 06, 2008

A- The beer pours a dark brownish read with very dense head. The head is off-white in color and dissipates slowly. The lacing was absolutely magnificent. Residual amounts of sediment.
S- I'm getting a lot of molasses, dried fruit, figs, and raisons. This is one of the few beers that deserves the label of complexity. 
T- Absolutely delicious. It tastes of malt, plums, candi sugar, and an assortment of fruits. Truly a unique tasting experience.
M- Medium bodied, but very rich. This one is definitely a sipper. I wish I had paired it with food. 
D- This beer could be paired with anything, or be enjoyed as an apperatif. This is an incredibly versatile beer. My only regret is not cellaring it for longer. 841 characterssessycuban, Jan 04, 2008
3.62/5  rDev -21.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Deep brown body topped by a thin head that fades quickly. Aroma is a lot of dark fruits, brown sugar and some nice malt sweetness. In fact, the aroma is the best part of this beer. Tatse is a bit flat. Malt and fruit flavors seem muted. Yeast autolysis is noticeable. Mouthfeel is OK, buit it seems a bit off. Like there's oil and water both in the same drink. Drinakibility is OK, but for the price I'd expect a lot more. 
I've been waiting to review this beer for a while (2 years since my first notes). I've tried 3 bottles from 3 locations - I guess I just don't like this beer as much as a lot of other beers! 615 charactersaaronh, Jan 04, 2008

A: Pours a deep reddish brown with an enormous head. The froth is off white in color and dissipated slowly. Lacing was beautiful on the glass. Slight amounts of sediment were poured in.
S: Molasses and fruit such as figs was present, also some raisin and bubblegum were detectable.
T: Simply put, delicious. Malt, plums, and a vast array of other various dark sugared tastes were a delight to the palate.
M: Moderately warming, with a somewhat lighter consistency than what I expected. Feels great in your mouth and going down.
D: Will I find myself craving this beer at many different occasions? Yes. However, some points taken off due to its rarity and inability to be a session beer 745 charactersfightingirishcmk, Jan 02, 2008

S- There is a very light malty aroma from the beer.
T- This is a very tasty beer with notes of chocolate, grape, raisin and plum.
M- The is a low carbonated beer but it is perfectly carbonated. It is smooth across the tongue and you want another sip asap.
D- I like this beer a lot. I obviously won't be having it often but I am happy to have the chance to try it. This was the last beer of a Trappist tasting so my notes were light even though this was great. 599 charactersMudpuppet, Jan 01, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Thanks to a very generous Aaron (leftmindedrighty) for this bottle as a x-mas present. This was a february 2007 bottling, cracked this New Years Eve 2007 at 6:15. chose this one first to start off the festivities as to not forget what i was tasting. 
Looks nice in my St. Bernardus chalice, deep brown with a 1/4 inch foamy head that sticks around for the entire glas, lacing quite well. 
Smells of dark fruit and alcohol. smells very sweet like a quad should. for a malthead like me it smells perfect. 
Tastes of brown sugar, dark cherries/figs, sweet. There is the presence of alcohol as well but i would never guess 10.2%.. this could be that the bottle i have is nearly a year old and it has mellowed, but if that is the case this is the best way to drink it. 
The mouthfeel on this beer is the best i have tasted to date. It is creamy, like the perfect chocolate melting in your mouth. 
The drinkability is good, i lowered the score on this one only because the ABV is a bit high to have more than one... which is good i guess since it is so expensive and hard to get, which is the second reason i docked the drinkability. I would love to have a sixer of these to hold on to and drink one per year for six years.. i think this beer would get nothing but better with time, year after year. 
Thanks again to Aaron for letting me try this brew, one of the FEW "top 100" that i havent thought was overrated. Now to try and find a westy 8 to try :) 1,454 characterstayner, Jan 01, 2008

Open this beer and pour it carefully into my favorite glass. Very dark and very nice head. The scent is beautiful with dark fruit and malt. Taste is nearly perfect. Some malt, dark fruit and earthy. So complex I need the list of adjectives. 
I may, if pressed, have some that are more favorite. The only thing that keeps me from buying this all the time is the price. $10 for one bottle is not a frequent visitor to my shelf. 564 charactersdaledeee, Dec 31, 2007
4.46/5  rDev -3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5At first glance, the pour seems sadly ironic, as the beer has been hyped up a bit on BA and you expect fireworks to shoot out from the glass. This did not happen however, and there wasn't a great amount of head, likely because of it being poured into a goblet. But otherwise a looker - left the sediment at the bottom of the bottle so not too much in the glass.
Aromatic, fairly powerful alcohol smell, similar to most Trappists, and expected.
Mouthfeel is truly the cornerstone of this brew, as it feels as though angels of my Jewish background have landed from the heavens of Jewdom and landed on my palate, creating a cornucopia of flavor explosion. There are literally clouds of life flowing about in my mouth.
Taste follows through with the smell and mouthfeel, light alcoholic flavors, hints of honey, and some other spices that I'm not familiar with but I'm sure have some fancy names ( see other reviews).
Overall, a great beer, not sure if worth the hype, but certainly great. It's likely due to my lack of beer tasting experience. It actually got me a little lightheaded. Yes. 1,090 charactersdontworrybeh0ppy, Dec 31, 2007

4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This is a rare treat. In this case it was a christmas present from Jason and Julie at Brews and Ales in Asheville, NC. Amazing beer store. Bottled just over a year ago at the abbey. Been again in perfect cellar conditions. Tasted in a blind quad tasting my brothers and I did along with Rochefort 10, St.Bernardus 60th anniversary, and SOuthampton Abbot 12(the surprising victor).
 Appearance was brown coppery with a creamy beige head. Nice head retention. Some legs holding long on the glass.(large chimay glass).
 Aroma was surprising subtle, but do not let that fool you, it was still extremely complex. Rich caramel notes. Heavy on the dark fruits, figs, prunes, especially raisins. Nice cinnamon raisin bread fresh out of the oven. There is something mature and classy about this aroma. It doesn't have to yell at you to make its point. Not as heavy on the banana esters as I remember. 
 Yummy taste. SPicy cinnamon and heavy raison flavor. Very complex taste progression. SUbtler on the caramel than the nose implies, which I appreciated. SHockingly smooth for such a rich full-bodied beer. Just a tinge of fusels. This beer is like a grandfather. It has an important message to impart and is full of wisdom , but you have to be listening closely, and selflessly. The brothers truly put a lot of love into this beer. I don't believe despite the brilliance of this beer that everyone would really get the point, but those who do are blessed. A gem. 1,454 charactersadamdotson, Dec 29, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle picked up at a bottle shop in Antwerp 2 weeks ago so it seems to be pretty fresh. I have had several bottles of this before but most of them were obtained in the U.S. from overseas. 
The beer poured a deep brown, almost black color with a medium thickness tan head that lasted for a few minutes and gave way to nice ring around the end but the lacing doesn't hold up well. The nose is pretty damn imressive. There are some fruit notes, dates, plums and a nice chocolately character. The taste is very impressive as well. The malty chocolate notes are the first thing that takes my taste buds on a ride along with some of the deep fruit notes I got in the aroma as well. The carbonation is rather full and overall makes for a full bodied beer. I could not say for sure whether this is the best beer in the world but it is a pretty damn good beer and well worth a try if you can get it for a reasonable price. 915 charactersggaughan, Dec 25, 2007
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a brown and murky with a large mousse-like tan head that lingers for a long time.
Smells of dark fruits, dried prunes, apricot and a very slight banana aroma. Very estery with nice bready malts.
Flavor is very similar to aroma with a nice subtle hop bitterness. Banana and dark fruits, again very estery. Flavors are a little muddled, but still very good.
The mouthfeel has slightly more body than I prefer in a Quad.
Overall I prefer St. Bernardus 12 over this beer. The slightly thicker mouthfeel gives this beer slightly less drinkability than SB12. 562 charactersdomtronzero, Dec 19, 2007
4.63/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Acquired via trade with recent trade with Ding. Thanks for the opportunity to review my first Westy 12. I've had 2 before, but hadn't reviewed them, just enjoyed them. Now to do both....
Poured into my Trappist Rochefort chalace. Best by date on cap is 09/05/10, so this is still a rather "young" Westvleteren compared to the 2 others I've had which were each past their date. Beer is a deep, hazy garnet color brushed with dark chocolate. Gorgeous 1 1/2 finger head of tan, falling ever so gracefully into streaks of hearty lace. No discernable carbonation rising from the glass.
Aromas of fig and shortbread immediately assault my senses. I can almost taste them through my nose, they're that prominent. Dates, raisins and sweet honey follow close behind. A huge malty whiff produces no apparent hop aroma, but this IS a quad, so.... I'm also getting no alcohol on the nose. I've had beers much smaller than the 10.2% listed here where the alcohol made itself known throughout the beer. Not in this case. Dangerously quaffable. 
Now for the taste. Not that I haven't been tasting it for the past 15 minutes, but I have to go back and try to remember everything I've tasted. Once again, shortbread, but albiet a bit spicier than on the nose. Peppery. Toffee and figs, dates and banana nut bread dance on my tongue. Hazelnuts coated in a yeasty, Belgian candi sugar. There's so much taste going on here, it's really hard to wrap my head (and taste buds) around it. 
Close to the end of the glass, and there's still a full covering of lace and more on the edges of the glass. Not too shabby for 1/2 hour later. 
Not overly carbonated with a mouthfeel that stays with you for a while. Nice and hearty for a 25 degree night and our first 8 inches of snow of the year. Alcohol definitely makes itself known towards the end of the beer. Does not take away from it's drinkability at all. You just have to put the brakes on so as not to guzzle the rest of the beer. 
I've been waiting all day to drink this beer, but waited until the snowball fights with my daughter and cocoa and shoveling were done. It was well worth the wait. And as hard as it is to get, it will be worth the wait until my next Westvleteren 12. But believe me, there will be a next one. 2,251 charactersBrewfan, Dec 14, 2007
3.9/5  rDev -15.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Drinking this to celebrate my 1 year anniversary on BA.
Bottle cap stamped with 29.08.10. That's when I plan to open 1 of 2 other bottles I have. 
A - Poured into the Westvleteren goblet a hazy dark brown colour with a few centimetres of beige head that slowly falls away to a thin whisp.
S - Big dark fruit notes up front as too be expected. Such an inviting smell. Some caramel sweetness & a nutty presence.
T - Dark fruit is also quite strong on the taste with a lot more caramel sweetness also coming through. A strong belgian yeast presence is also quite dominant.
M - Slightly syrupy, medium bodied beer with minimal carbonation.
D - A very nice, well made & interesting beer. The 10.2%ABV as well as availability and price lower the drinkability a bit.
I think the "rarity" of this artifically heightens it's overall score. 830 charactersbrendan13, Dec 09, 2007
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Blank bottle with a yellow cap purchased from eBay for about twenty dollars after shipping, this one spent about four months in my closet before finally drinking it, had a best before October 2008 (10-8-08) date
Very special occasion tonight, so I decided to drink the highest rated beer in the world and indulge into the holy grail of Belgium, I was very anxious to see if this one lived up to all the hype and deserved to be number one rated on this site
Poured into my Westvleteren chalice that came with this beer when I purchased it, had a murky dark brown color with a dark red tint when held up to the light, the head was almost an inch and was off white and creamy, left crazy amounts of lacing during the hour plus while I was drinking this
Smell ranged as the drinking experience went on, at the end it smelled mostly like a candy apple, at first I got a significant amount of dark fruit, some Belgian yeast, and a lot of sugar in general, also a small amount of citrus aromas at the end
Taste was strong and had several different things going on, this one probably gets better with each month of aging and look forward to testing this opinion sometime in the upcoming years, started out with fig, raisins, sweet malt, sugary accents, prunes, and toffee, as it got warmer more fruity flavors kept coming to the surface, by the end I had tasted tangerine, grapefruit, and lemons but all faintly, some butterscotch, this one was dominated mostly by dark fruit and had red apple and grapes as well, no real evidence of any hop profile, had a nice syrupy texture that forced me to take my time drinking it thankfully because I probably would have guzzled it otherwise because it was so good, nice variety of malt and sugars overall making this a nice sweet Belgian, significantly better than Westvleteren 8 to me but that is just an opinion, wish I had more of this right now
Perfect amount of carbonation, a very thick and full body, a taste that kept attacking the taste buds for close to a minute, great mouthfeel
Could drink this all night and day if it was not for the fact that it was ten percent alcohol, its availability and price do not make it much easier, the alcohol is hidden well in here nevertheless and it is a smooth and easy to drink quadrupel, even though it tasted more like a tripel to me, not too filling on the stomach
Well, this beer was fantastic but it certainly was not the best beer I have ever had, probably towards the bottom of my top ten though, even though it was the best quadrupel I have tasted, I think the fact that it is limited and you can only get it directly from the monastery a couple times a month makes this beer so sought after
I wish I would not have traded away my other bottle but at least I got a Russian River Toronado out of the deal, this beer truly is a novelty and I see myself forking out significant dough for this again in the future via an online auction or trade
As far as the talk and excitement about the beer, Westy 12 is worth it, but I would not pay forty dollars a bottle for it at a bar but twenty bucks or so seems okay to spend from time to time, I highly recommend it even if you have to go through the hassle of getting from someone in Belgium because otherwise people are going to have some from trades or vacations where they brought some of this back, it is definitely a rare and highly demanded beer, yes this one was noticeably better than St. Bernardus 12 in my opinion, I am happy I got to try such a great beer and hope all of you some time soon 3,539 charactersFloydster, Dec 08, 2007

Huge thanks to Pimpp for this 1!
A- Hazy murky red with a nice creamy head. Foamy lacing on the glass.

4.68/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Trappist Westvleteren 12 (1998 Vintage) (Rating 9.5/10) - 11 ABV - 26 Nov 2007
Not too long ago, in my haul from CrackedKettle's online beer sales, I have a Westvleteren 12 from 1998 and the date on the cap is for the year 2001. (I am not sure if it shld be 1997 instead) So I had a contemporary Westy 12 2 days ago and I clearly recall the taste as well as the full experience and gratification level; let's see how this one does. It is interesting to note that in 1998 (when I was in middle school), Westvleteren 12 is 11 ABV as opposed to the 10.2 ABV that it is today; it was also 10.6 ABV at a certain point in time. Man this baby is crowned tight; it took some effort to get it off and immediately a vinous grassy aroma can be can be detected at the opening of the bottle; some dark fruits but not really impressive here. I poured it out into my old Abdij St Sixtus oversized wine glass and a one finger thick head developed over a dark amber brown liquid below. What surprised me was the way this head grew to a 2 finger thick head which persisted for a while. the head was creamy and bubbly but more bubbly and I prefered the creamier head on the contemporary Westvleteren. The smell was not very strong but the vinous part of it was clear; there was this light yeasty bready smell with a little bit of fruits underneath and I think I sense a dash of malts but in general the smell was not fantastic. Moving on to the taste, the nutty/almondy goodness from the contemporary Westy was still present though the intensity probably halved. Other than the nutty entry, there was a well pronounced vinous taste of aged beers that was well within expectation along with the a nice maltiness which followed behind. Sweetness was clear but it was not a "thick" sweetness like in the contemporary Westvleteren; it became a more mellow sweetness. The fruitiness was also more subtle and mellow on this one; I can raisins, grapes and some plums which were kind of buried under the malts but stil detectable along with the sweetness. The finish was a pleasant nutty/almondy dryness with nice vinous aromas, maltiness and plums on the nose. The maltiness and the fruitiness towards the finish was a very pleasant part of the taste that somewhat reminds me of the greatly aged 1985-1988 La Trappe Dubbel that I had which was so called one of the best aged beer I ever had thus far; up there with the Special 6. On the whole I still prefer the taste of the contemporary Westvleteren though I prefer this one's finish. It was clearly a very much mellowed down taste which had it's unique strengths. The after taste was flooded with malts, brown sugar sweetness and dark fruits starting with plums and moving on to raisins and grapes after a while. The mouthfeel on this was about medium bodied; clearly the aging compromises on the thickness and the creaminess as well. It was still slightly creamy to drink and the carbonation was clearly going low but still pretty sufficient. 11 ABV seems deceivingly smooth and light and I almost thought this was a 7 or 8 ABV if I did not know from the start that it is 11 ABV. Again I prefer the mouthfeel of the contemporary Westvleteren 12. Let's now break things down further, the smell was largey vinous aromas which was obviously different from the contemporary's intensely fruity and sweet smell. Taste was a classic mellowed down version which was generally not as good except for the slightly pre-finish and finish which was in a greatness realm of it's own.Mouthfeel lost thickness, richness and creaminess as well as some carbonation over time but surprisingly, the nuttiness was still there. Very nice and I can really appreciate it but I still prefer the contemporary Westy to this particular bottle of 1998 Vintage; I mean aging really produces different results... We all know that. Cheers for the season folks! :)Ok, I am v.slightly intoxicated.. maybe it is my lethargy and lack of food... and... 11 ABV heh...

4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5At long last, the holy grail-esque Westy 12. 
Pours a murky brown/red color, not much head, but there is a thin rim of carbonation. Surprisingly drinkable considering the ABV. Not as thick as I expected.
Taste is sublime. Very much what I could imagine quaffing by the jugful in a European village pub. Delicious cherries, plums, malt, and just a hint of spiciness to the palate. Very well integrated considering its ridiculous complexity. I could go on and on, but this a beer that I suspect has been thoroughly reviewed before.
Not my favorite beer, but it's up there. 573 charactersOverlord, Nov 25, 2007
4.51/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Well, here we go; its been a 3 year journey on BA, and for review 1000 its time for the Westy 12.
Murky brown pour as I swirled to get every freakin last bit from the plain glass bottle. Not much tan head, but not expected with the 10+% alcohol in this  which, by the way, is not detectable in the least.
Dark fruits, malt and a cherry finish. Doesnt seem to overpowering by any means. Very drinkable in fact, slides like a dream  but the glow in my cheeks are showing the high alcohol in this one.
This is one tasty brew, but, ya know what? The price is too high unless youre in Belgium drinking from the local café. But this is to be experienced in your lifetime. 683 charactersVancer, Nov 24, 2007
4.83/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Cap states: 07.03.10. I think.
Into a St Bernardus glass, pours a lovely russet brown, a fluffy, bubbly tan twinged head diminishing to a bubbly foamy film, lacing in sheets coming down the glass with a swirl, slowly receding till splotchy spots remain. Give 'er a swirl and that head pops right back up. A lovely start.
The aroma, though not as enveloping as its Dubbel brother, is a treat in its own right. What hits me first is the ripe dark fruits, raisins, berries, a very sweet Belgian sugar heaping with hefty caramels and a slight honey bready feel, very rich and very enticing.
And then, the taste. I suppose I could probably drone on about the sweets, the spices, the mouthful of malts and yeasty earthiness, the way it changes and surprises and delights, dries through the end with a lingering beauty... I'll just say its perfect. And an incredibly smooth mouth, ultra fine carbonation, the alcohol warm and caressing, everything here is superb.
In sum, its in fact a remarkable beer, worth the praise and the efforts required to acquire. What may perhaps be so amazing is it keeps light and dodgy, beckoning for you to try some more... yes yes, open that other bottle, raid that cellar, Clear your STASH! DRINK IT ALL! It really would be that easy, such a joy to drink. 
Huge thanks go to tpd975 for getting me this bottle!! 1,341 charactersobjectivemonkey, Nov 20, 2007
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Dark brown, slightly translucent around the edges. Pours with a 2-inch head that eventually settles to a quarter-inch. Very good head retention, a trait I've noticed amongst most Trappist beers.
Aroma: Dark dried fruits, figs, candi sugar, slight alcohol. Very aromatic.
Taste & texture: Very fruity initially, though not overly sweet. Takes on a rum cake quality toward the middle. The finish leans more on the dry, herbal and hoppy side, though it retains a trace of sweetness.
Notes: I compared this side-by-side with St. Bernardus Abt 12, and while quite similar, I slightly prefer this. I found it more aromatic and slightly more balanced. In contrast, St. Bernardus is a bit more dry and bitter in finish, though both beers are excellent. While I approached this with as much cynicism as I could muster, it really is great, and largely worthy of the praise it receives. Hard to call it the best beer ever, but I'm not sure I could say that about any beer. Nonetheless, it's well worth trying.
1997 vintage consumed 2011:
Murky ruddy brown color. This has lost some carbonation, but it looks decent. Very fruit-forward nose with fairly pleasant oxidation, smells decent. Palate is very oxidized, a little cardboardy. Earthy fruit is also prevalent. Carbonation is a bit low at this point. Pretty good, but I'd take a fresh bottle over this. 1,362 characterslargadeer, Nov 17, 2007
4.34/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours a dark chestnut color. No head just some thin white lace on top and around the glass. Yeast floating around.
Mmmm this smells like gingerbread and oatmeal cookies right out of the oven.
Big malty flavors. Candy sugars. Whole wheat toast. Raisins. Somewhat nutty. Pecans and Almonds. Well balanced with a big alcohol kick at the end.
I think it's the mouthfeel that sets this beer apart from the others. It's perfect. Silky smooth with some alcohol kick and lively carbonation. It coats the mouth and warms you going down. I like.
It's 10% and drinkable. The alcohol is definately there, but hey it's a big beer.
This beer has been hyped as much as Obama/Clinton, but when you drink it you realize that it's just a beer. A very good beer, but just a beer. 760 characterswcudwight, Nov 11, 2007

My last Westvleteren of the night and a great one to cap off my b-day celebration. I came across three of these so I dont know who exactly to thank, I think this is the bottle that I received from BuckeyeNation, thanks!
Date of 29.02.08 on the cap (the clearest date of all 3 westvleterens I had tonight).
Pours a ruby, dark brown color. Not too active on the foam but seems to settle to a nice thin ring around the glass, and I say seems to settle because as it warms up that ring becomes a bit thicker. 
Very good aroma. Spiciness, dark fruits, bread dough, cinnamon, raisins, cherries, dark sugars, really varied and floral. Caramel and burnt sugar, candied yams, piloncillo, very good all around. Reminds me very much of Rochefort 10 and this might just be a step above. The aromas feel very well balanced and once you pick up on one, another quickly demands attention. Im just trying to enjoy this as a whole, I think it works best this way. 
The taste is fantastic. Again, spicy with dark fruits like figs, prunes, raisins, and then there is a sweet bread finish. The after-taste is sweet and slightly alcoholic. 
Mouth-feel is not as creamy as I thought it would be but still very good. After-taste, just like the westvleteren 8, is very clean with just a few hints of dark fruits and some residual sugars in the back of the mouth. 
It has been a great experience in reviewing all three Westvleterens within 24 hrs. Although it is a very good beer, Rochefort 10 is just as good, easier to get and more economical, plain and simple. 1,566 charactersseaoflament, Nov 07, 2007
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to rayjay for this.
A - Murky dark brownish red with very little head. Actually was expecting more out of the head.
S - Spicy with dark fruit and caramel malt. I detect a little alcohol in the nose.
T - Malty sweet with plum, chocolate, toffee and spices. Very well balanced. Alcohol warmth on the back end.
M - Full bodied and creamy
D - Pretty decent drinkable for how big this beer is. 
Overall, this is one of the best Quads I have ever had. I did this as a side by side with the Rochfort 10 and prefered the Westy. That said I can get a Rochefort all the time. Westy is much more difficult. Yes there is a bit of hype to this beer, but it is a great for a reason. 681 charactersMonsone, Nov 07, 2007

06.12.09 printed on cap.
Dark cola appearance. Off-white head diminishes quickly. Smells of dark fruits, grape, red wine, and cotton candy. Very aromatic. Tastes sugary sweet, dark dried fruits, dark cherries, grapes, and a small bit of chocolate mixed in there. Kinda boozy, some alcohol warming as it goes down. Flavors linger in the finish. Mouth feel is mildly creamy at first then turns a bit syrupy. Good amount of carbonation.
Overall, the drinkability was not bad. ProbabIy wont be seeking it out again. Worth a try. Cheers! 571 charactersDavidEddie, Nov 05, 2007
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is one killer beer, those monks sure know what they are doing. They only thing I was disappointed with was the appearance but I have another bottle to be had on another special occasion ( I had this one the day after my B-Day Oct 24th to be exact cause I knew I would be to drunk to appreciate it on the 23rd, I always take notes than type them up on BA). I poured the 12 fairly vigorously ( which is my usual pour) and to my surprise the head was fairly small and there was minimal lacing. The color is very attractive though a hazy brown with a bit of purple tints.
Every other aspect of this brew is amazing. The nose is full of dark fruits ( plums, raisins), candy sugar, a bit of malt, some spices and so much more. I can only imagine how many different scents I could pick out of this beer after having it a couple of times ( and I don't even have a great nose). 
Tastes like heaven will ( if I make it). The alcohol is almost completely hidden, has notes of raisins, plums, sweet malt, spices and yeast. No wonder this is rated so highly. Believe the hype. 1,070 charactersirishkyle21, Nov 02, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle purchased at In De Vrede cafe in June of 2006, stored in a dark closet until drinking on 28 October 2007. Best before date of 08.04.09. Pulled this one out to celebrate the award of a master's degree to my girlfriend. Relieved to hear a massive whoosh of carbonation upon opening... poured into a Trappist chalice served just below room temperature. lets see how she went...
Appearance - Nice, strong two-finger head with a beautiful deep mohagony color with ruby sheen when held up to the light. Head slowly and evenly recedes to an even cover of lace. Some chunks of yeast despite careful handling and 85% pour. Beautiful Belgian abt.
Smell - Sweet dark fruits (raisins, figs) coming through immediately, followed by a wonderul rush of aromas that is almost too complex to decode any individual components. Sweet candy, even a strange whiff of marshmellow. Extremely enticing, smells amazing. Alcohol notes come through in the nose.
Taste - Dark fruits predominant with a host of complexity swirling around this main theme - bit of toffee/caramel, molasses, chocolate. Ever-so-slight burnt edge with a great balance that prevents it from being overly-sweet. Slightly boozy, but in a good way - can be compared with the smoothness of a high quality whiskey (that element that sets it apart from a cheap whiskey). Amazingly pleasant aftertaste - like no other beer.
Mouthfeel - Perhaps the highlight of the beer; super-silky feel with the perfect amount of carbonation that spreads the flavor out evenly over the tongue. Spot-on for use of texture and carbonation to most efficiently deliver the flavor to the mouth. Perfect.
Drinkability - Exceptional drinkability. Certainly for sipping, but the beautiful aroma, taste and mouthfeel fuse into a very drinkable brew that I could drink until the ABV caught up with me (which, at 10.2% (probably more after &gt;1 year in the cellar/closet) is pretty quickly). 
Notes: I am very happy that my stash has not been tarnished by my less-than ideal storage conditions. Compared to the many that I drank last year in Belgium, the beer has retained many of its great characteristics while mellowing out in the alcohol slightly. I would say that it has lived up to the hype that is associated with it... this is for a damn good reason. I hope this beer always maintains the quality and doesn't sacrifice this for quantity. Proost. 2,383 characterswilljansen, Oct 28, 2007

I have heard so much hype for the Westy 12 in the last three years, and I do have to say, I was very excited to try this one out. Just like the others, I was not disappointed one bit.
Red copper hues, prunes and plums, then add chocolate and caramel. So much complexity, full body, some alcohol present to the nose and mouth. Dried cherry, tons of pleasant sweet aftertaste. Nothing to add that others haven't already.
Okay, I'm retired. No more beers for me. What's the point? 568 charactersBacker2004, Oct 16, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I bought this back in 2005 from The Belgian Shop.
This pours from 12oz bottle( stamped date of 07 06 08) a deep brown that you just can't see through, ok, I'll say murky. The head takes up about 20% of my New Belgium goblet and is an off white and is thick and billowy that I imagine myself being able to a take a bite out of it and it would be chewy. Also, there's a few sprinkles on the top of the head from the sediment.
The smell has a realy dark fruity nose to it, raisin-prine-plum-fig, along with some chocolate, yeast, coffee, and yeah, a bit of the alcohol.
The taste on first sip has the dark fruits at center stage. Subtly sweet portions of plum, raisin, fig, some dark cherry, a touch of chocolate and cofee(and I do mean just a touch) and a slight bitterness in the form of some citrus near the tail end of the sip and it carries on right through the finish where I also get some of the alcohol that warms the throat during the swallow. This is so darn complex that I fear my words will not do it justice but hey, I'm doing the best I can. ;^)
Ok, I'm about 2/3rds of the way through my glass and the chocolate is a bit more pronounced now and that simply adds to how silky smooth the mouthfeel is. And look at all that sticky lacing on the sides of my glass!
This is the second of my bottles I've tasted(the last one was shortly after I received them) and I'm as impressed now as I was then....a 2 year span. 
Bottom line: Yeah, I spent a few bucks to get my bottles of Westvletern 12(and 8) and I could have bought lots of other beers for the cost but, I feel that the money was spent well. I've had other quadrupels before and I liked them. I'm partial to the style. Is this the best example of the style that I've had to date? You darn tootin. Is it because of the scarcity factor? No. It's because my palate tells me that it is *that* damn good. Complexity in the taste? This has it. Complexity that has all the flavours working in harmony? This has it. A great looking appearance in a glass? This has it. A nose that keeps you sniffing before every sip? This has it. A mouthfeel that is both silky smooth and chewy at the same time? This comes very close. Drinkability that goes through the roof? Just about. So, would I buy some again? At current prices?(US$18 per bottle plus shipping from Belgium) Maybe, but if it was as "easily" available as other examples of the style, I'd buy it by the case. 2,425 charactersBitterbill, Oct 12, 2007
4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into tulip. Cap reads 07.03.1. Served at 48F.
A - Dark brown with small reddish tint, light is difficult to penetrate.
Nice egg white head. Massive lacing.
S - Like some kind of antiquated Christmas pie, so many deep dark fruits rush up. Alcohol present but not overwhelming. 
T - Fig, dark fruit in general, fruit juice notes and sweet malt. Finish with subdued but perfectly adequate astringency, which I can only attribute to hops , though they seem hard to perceive. It starts veering toward thick cloying, then 'zeros' out magically. Reaches the peak of fruitiness then pulls back.. Nice trick.
M - Different than any other beer I know. Full feel, lots of fruit notes, medium carbonation. The bigness of the fruit and the subsequent reigning in are most remarkable.
D - Too big a beer to session. One is enough for a special occasion then move on. 
Expensive, but a must. 889 characterssrandycarter, Oct 11, 2007
4.06/5  rDev -11.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Caramel malt smell. Some spiciness going on. Banana phenol comes out as the beer warms.
This is a good beer but no where neer the best beer in the world. Caramel malts come out on the forefront. Beer gets better as it warms It's very good, but it's a litle simple. Just some belgian fermented beer with caramel malts. It's really good, but not anywhere near the best beer in the world. There are a good amount of undertones, but nothing reall comes out and says "hey taste buds, what's up?" Some phenol comes out, the alcohol presents it self as well. Banana phenol notes comes out as beer warms. The beer is just kind of mellow and not that exciting. I prefered Avery's The Reverend.
Decent mouthfeel, but not great.
I could make a decent session of this beer. 764 charactersjasonjlewis, Oct 09, 2007

Judging by the '09 on the cap, this was probably bottled Nov. 29, 2006. It poured a dark murky brown, but wasn't cloudy, just impenetrably solid brown. The head arrived as a small cap, but it did stick around for the duration.
Aroma is wonderfully vinous, like fresh, young grapes crushed in a new-wood tun. Quirky yeast character in the background, just what you would expect from a secret and hallowed Belgian yeast strain. More aromas: prune, raisin...and more grapes, white ones too.
Flavor is a strong, assertive grape character with a mild alcohol warmth and subtle notes of weird nuttiness from the yeast. (weird = good) Some prune juice and raisin, and other dark fruits, slight chalky cocoa...Incredibly succulent, so much that I can't properly compare it to another beer. Rough grape skin acidity in the finish, but in a good way. A big, controlled, unique beer.
Mouthfeel is fairly neutral, in that it offers carbonation and silkiness in equal parts, nothing stunning but certainly adequate. It dries fast, and there's a fruity sourness in its finish.
Heavily vinous, and clearly a top-notch beer. I would definitely pay a crazy price for another bottle. There's more here than just one tasting can reveal. 1,411 charactersMetalmonk, Oct 07, 2007
4.6/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had a mini quad tasting with HellsBells24 in April 07. Had this one after the Abt 12.
Received this bottle from rayjay via trade. Thanks Jason!
Appearance: Pours a nice and clear brown color with a 1.5 finger tan head. Slightly red around the edges. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter. This looks very similar to the Abt12.
Aroma: Starts with some dark fruits, nice malts and a slight alcohol burn. This is followed by dark fruits, figs, roasted malts, and slight cherry. The aroma is more pronounced as it warms. Very nice. Lets see how it tastes.
Taste: The tastes are similar to the aroma, but not a noticable. Cherry and dark fruits from the start followed by warming alcohol and some spicy hops. There is a nice malt background that balances all these flavors.
Mouthfeel: The dark fruit and malt flavors hang for a bit. This is pretty creamy.
Drinkability: This goes down very smooth for 10.2%. I wish I had more than one bottle of this because I could easily drink a few of these.
Overall. This finished behind the Rochefort 10 and slightly above the Abt 12 and Chimay Blue. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others). I'm not sure if it's worth $20 if you don't get it in Belgium due beers of similar quality being available more readily and for much cheaper. Definitely a beer you have to try though. 1,338 charactersnorthernbrews, Oct 05, 2007
4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.10.09 stamped on the cap. I've had these for a year or so as part of a wonderful gift from a 12 pack given to me. Poured at ~55F into my Westvleteren chalice. Strong tan head, decent retention, solid lacing. Nose has notes of rasin, figs and dates, perhaps plum. Mouthfeel is silky and spicy. Taste is similar to the nose, just more apparent in the depths of a profound flavor. This is sure making my Tuesday night something special. Truly one of the world's best offerings for a "commercial" beer, although I'm not sure this is the epitiome of a commercial offering. As far as drinkability goes, should we even discuss this? This beer is closest to the St Bernardus Abt 12, but is much cleaner, deeper and pure. Truly the best quadrupel offering by a long shot. I'd offer a longer diatribe about the complexities and beauty of this beer, but if you dont get it already, there is nothing my words can do. 907 characterslifeboyq, Oct 03, 2007
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got this in trade well over six months ago and man has it been hard to wait this long, but in celebration of my 24th birthday I decided it was time. I've heard so much about this beer over the course of the year some say its the best quad ever, some say its all hype now its time to put it all to criticism:
Cap states 09.08.09 I assume this is a best by date. I chilled this a touch below cellar and let it warm up for about fifteen minutes. Finally the caps off and I can immediately smell complex notes of yeast and alcohol. Poured into my watou goblet huge two fingers of off white, light brown almost gray egg shell color head, it is immense very tight and creamy. The retention is decent and lacing creamy and thick. The body away from the light is a muddy red brown, though through a light red amber hughes are apparent. It sort of looks like an unpasteurized, unfermented very dark apple cider.
Aroma is big and complex with notes of chocolate and caramelized sugars, burnt biscuit, hints of yeast and grandiose complex alcohol on the back-end. It smells almost port like, green raisons, a bit vinous sort of like vintages tokaji, its that sort of dirty musty scent with sweet dark fruit aromas. As it warms clove like big alcohol become more apparent. I get apple core, touches of vanilla on the outer rim with subtle and very illusive touches of fig, pear and pecans. 
Taste is big lots of caramelized flavors and burnt sugars. The carbonation is apparent on the fist part of the draw making it a bit lighter than expected. I get the musty slightly chocolety tokaji taste and as it warms up it becomes more and wine like (not like a cab., pino., or, chardonnay, but big and well aged port, muscadet, tokaji.). After the swallow notes of burnt rummed raisons (this is where the bitterness manifests) present them selves and on the finish a nice alcohol warmth. Apple core and hints of vanilla are also present in the taste as it warms.
This is one big complex beer that really needs time to be consumed it is always fun to experience the change temperature can make in a these type of beers. If you ever have the pleasure of drinking this do not make the mistake of drinking it too fast or too cold it must be consumed slowly to let it warm up and express it's full potential. Great for the style and a pleasure to drink. 2,334 charactersmmcave, Sep 27, 2007
4.25/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours a cloudy medium brown color with a frothy head that persists somewhat and leaves plenty of lace
Smell: Boozy aroma of rum-soaked raisin, dried cherry, honey, cocoa powder and candi sugar
Taste: Starts with a dark fruit laden mouthful of creamy cocoa; after the swallow, the fruit and chocolate flavors build without ever becoming too sweet, although there are some residual honey, cotton candy and toffee elements that appear in the finish
Mouthfeel: Full and creamy body with moderate carbonation; warmth on the finish
Drinkability: I'm glad I finally had a chance to try this but, to be honest, I prefer the Rochefort 10; this one is just a bit too boozy for my taste 691 charactersbrentk56, Sep 16, 2007
4.16/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Received bottle from Tangfoot (all hail!).
Disclaimer: This bottle was the casualty of the shipment, arriving wet and leaking. I'd lost about 20% of the beer in transit. I rinsed the bottle, and stuck it in the fridge. After 3 days of hemming and hawing, I decided to trhow caution to the wind and crack it. Hence...
A: Dark brown, murky gold on the edges. Eureka! Still has bubbles! I got about 1/2" of dense bubbles which died down almost immediately, leaving no lacing, but plenty of swirly patterns on top of my beer.
S: ::cautious:: not skunky. Smells of malt and alcohol, maybe some raisins. Not much smell, unfortunately, could be due to leakage?
T: Ahh. Malty-caramelly-figgy-molassesy. A hint of alcohol heat underneath, but very understated.
M/D: Thick and syrupy, but not cloying. Excellent for sipping, just take it easy, and enjoy the bottle.
I'd love the chance to try one that's aged a bit! 911 charactersk3n, Aug 30, 2007
4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to metallitone1 for this one of a kind beer.
Poured into my Chimay goblet. 
28.03.10 stamped on the cap.
Pours a dark chesnut brown with a frothy thin off-white head that dies down to a mystical layer that floats on top the entire time. Lacing is spotty all over the sides of the glass. Smell is so complex. Combination of yeasty goodness, dark fruits (fig, cherry, raisin, dates, plum), sweet caramel malt, sugary vanilla, thick honey, and fresh flowers. I can't think of a single beer that even compares to this one in terms of smell. Taste starts off with a bready yeast which is then bitch slapped by a whole lot of sweet goodness. Almost tastes like a caramel apple to me as lame as that sounds, but think about it when you take a sip next time. Aftertaste is a bit spicey, but perfect in the sense. Mouthfeel is full, complex, and warming with the perfect amount of carbonation. A bit of burning alcohol in the throat as it slides down, but the alcohol has to be somewhere with a 10.2% abv. beer. Hype? What hype!?...this beer clearly delivers. 1,071 charactersBeerTruth, Aug 22, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I can't believe I just popped the cap on this. I'd been saving it for so long, it became a staple of my beer collection. But in celebration of my 100th review and more importantly, my wedding yesterday, this is as good a time to enjoy it as there is.
Best by date: 07 06 08
Served after cooling in the fridge for 45 minutes
APPEARANCE: Pours into my Trois Pistoles chalice a very dark brown with no light getting through. The head starts at a one finger height and drops to a huge collar and large bubbly patch. Mine unfortunately has some chunky sediment floating in it. Lacing is present in a few splotchy patches.
SMELL: The smell is huge with fruity estery aromas. Raisin, plum, sour cherry, red wine, you name it - it's all here. Yeasty breadiness is minimal and the smell of alcohol comes through pretty well.
TASTE: Heaven. I wish I could give it more than a 5.0 for this. Just the most complex, well balanced blend of flavors I could imagine. The same flavors from the aroma are there in the taste, but they fuse together so well that they are almost imperceptable from one another. Alcohol heat is very minimal and the finish is only slightly dry and amazingly clean. Amazingly, fantastically, incredibly wonderful.
MOUTHFEEL: Medium full body without being remotely syrupy or thick. It almost seems light because of some kind of monk magic or something. Carbonation is super fine and effervescent.
DRINKABILITY: Again, off the charts. It goes down like it's nothing and is smooth the whole way. You might even think this is a session beer, the alcohol is so hidden. It's just a perfect beer.
Oh, it's so sad to see it go. Who knows if I'll ever have the opportunity again. I'm just at a loss for words trying to describe this beer anymore. Believe the hype. And if you have a chance to drink this, DO IT. 1,836 charactersjmalex, Aug 19, 2007
4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dear friends just returning from Belgium honoured me with this offering that we opened the same night due to a bit of dampness around the top of the bottle, possibly due to the flight over the Atlantic. The bottle cap bore the date 26-05-10. I could hardly wait to see what this Trappist offering was all about!
Poured into a Chimay goblet - with the letters turned around ofcourse. This showed as a dark, opaque plum or prune colour that, under a very bright light, had an off-orange hue around the edges and was hazy and cloudy in the middle. A half-inch head flattenned out to a thinner crown of very tiny bubbles that covered the whole top of the beer. These were a multitude of slow risers that persisted throughout. 
The smell was a rich aroma of fresh dates. Full, rich taste in the mouth with balanced bitterness. The finish was elegant and satisfying and not overpowering in the least despite the alcohol content. The mouthfeel was really exceptional and the finish satisfying, long and lingering. The subtle carbonation stayed for the duration of the tasting, even while there was less than a half inch left in the glass. This was truly a delightful taste experience, many thanks for this one. 1,209 charactersThatWineGuy, Aug 19, 2007
4.9/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Details- 330 ml served in a chilled Westvleteren Chalice. I was worried about the hype this beer has generated so I waited until my forth tasting before submitting a review (the events were spread out over several months with the most recent tonight).
.
A  It is a beautiful murky dark ale that has tan tight bubbles that linger deep into the experience and leave a nice lace ring on the glass.
S  Subtle spices and roasted molasses. I frequently put my nose deep into the glass to get another joyous whiff. I only wish I had a colon that smelled as good as this beer does. 
M - Mellow, slightly sweet, creamy, and spiced. I feel rich drinking this beer. Its full bodied without being heavy. The alcohol is well hidden.
T - A creamy and malty, rich but subtle masterpiece. The flavors are subdued and balanced so no one dominates. There are hints of figs, chocolate, toffee with a touch of spices. The blend of flavors coats my tongue and leaves a pleasant light aftertaste that makes me want another sip. I want this beer to linger yet I lust every sip. I am in danger of becoming a addict to this great beer.
D - A great quadruple. Simply the best. I could drink it night after night. However, living 3,000 miles from the source makes the price per unit of enjoyment a bit out of my everyday range. Hence, it is my special treat. When I want to go to a happy place this is the beer for me. 1,409 charactersdnichols, Aug 19, 2007
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very dark brown. Big fluffy head that dissipates somewhat quick. Silky white lacing. Looks delicious. Too many smells to distinguish. Fig, caramel, raison, plumb, jam, malt, honey, tea, spices and mild alcohol. Flavors are abundant as well. It tastes of all that the smell indicates and it is an unreal flavor experience. The warming from the alcohol is the only indication that it exists. A spicy semi dry finish. The drinkability is unreal for any beer, especially for this type and abv. Lives up to the hype through and through. A unique experience that should be on every BA's list. 594 charactersfranksnbeans, Aug 15, 2007

A - A beautiful dark ale w/ compact bubbles and light tan head 
S - Roasty, spicy and sweet with scents of currants and dark sugar.
M - Mellow, sweet and spiced. Layered and balanced with a subtle feel of alcohol and lightly nutty finish.
T - A malty supple masterpiece. So much flavor figs, nutmeg, gentle herbal notes. So layered and yet the flavors blend seamlessly. Nuts, toffee and honey with a tinge of spice and light grain flavors.
D - A great nuanced ale - lives up to the hype. 553 charactersSlatetank, Aug 14, 2007

Received in trade from brewedlyhooked13
Poured carefully into a Chimay Goblet. Date ? (I'll have to check the cap later) Dense, creamy light brown head with great retention eventually leaving a nice lacing. Body is slightly murky brown. Not much carbonation after the pour, at least that I could see. Beatuiful sight. Heavenly aromas! Yeast, dark fruit, caramel, candy sugar- everything you would expect from a quad but nothing out of the ordinary. Complex flavors hinted by the aroma with some dry bitterness. Very well balanced. Such a smooth mouthfeel! Hardly any sign of the alcohol. Incredibly drinkable for a big beer.
This was my first, and more than likely last, experience with Westy 12. As good as it was there are other more accessible Quads (St. Bernardus 12, Trappistes Rochefort 10) just as good that don't break the bank like this does. One of those "At least now I can say I tried it" beers. Now onto the Dark Lord!! 996 charactersjj21, Aug 10, 2007

A: Pours into a small chalice with a reddish brown color and a bubbly head. Moderate lacing.
S: Beautifully complex smell. Raisins, figs, caramel, candy sugar, and several more aromas. Too many to identify, but they're all good.
T: Sweet but balanced with a multi-dimensional flavor. A taste of dark fruits is first noticable and is complemented with a sweet toffee-like flavor. Alcohol is very well-hidden. Blissful.
M: Full-bodied with carbonation that is a bit light for most Belgians, but just how I like it. A wam, fuzzy sensation from the alcohol.
D: Damn. An amazingly superb beer that is worth the hype. This one easily makes my top 3. 711 charactersklewis, Aug 08, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My 300th review; and what a beer to review for #300, thanks to a fellow northern Colorado B-A who shared this with me in a side-by-side with a Westvleteren 8. What an hour! Amazing! Well, on to the review . . .
Served at about 55 degrees. 
Slow pour into a tulip glass yields a smallish tan-yellow head over a clear dark mahogany-cherry body. Lovely beer. The small solid head stays put like meringue on a chocolate pie, hardly diminishing at all over the 40 minutes I savored this baby, and leaves thick sheets of lacing. 
Smell is astonishingly rich. Maybe the best-smelling beer I've ever had. I must have put my nose down into the glass fifty times, it smelled so good. Dates, raisins, dark chocolate, caramel, pepper, leather, coriander, espresso, toffee. I don't think I can describe it. 
Taste is even more broad-spectrumed than the aroma. The front flavors include all of the above notes from the aroma, all sweet and nice. The mid-palate starts to darken up things, and the spices come up. The finish is all deep and warmly-bitter, with a length that lasts and lasts. BTW, the alcohol is not even noticeable on the tongue. 10.2%? No, it tastes and feels like 5% or less. 
Mouthfeel is fantastic, but really not as thick and rich as the aroma and taste. Fine and long-lasting carbonation spreads things around nicely. It's so smoooth, though, and so creamy, I'm giving it a 5.
Drinkability? Wow! So easy on the palate, and the alcohol is totally invisible. I could drink this for hours, because it would take me that long to drink 2 or 3 -- there is so much going on here, your palate would never get bored. 
Believe the hype. While a tiny bit lacking in appearance and mouthfeel, the aroma and taste of this beer are matched -- at least in my experience -- only by the 2005 Dark Lord.
Thanks again to my fellow (anonymous) B-A for sharing this amazing and understandably highly-sought-after beer. Dude, you are excellent. 1,955 charactersColoradoBobs, Aug 05, 2007
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Here it is, my first taste of the Holy Grail. Pour is a dark mahogany brownish color, with a creamy off white, light brown 2 inch head. The head color seems to taper off and slowly fade into the top of the beer, very beautiful presentation. The head leaves lacing and large bubbles of dark and light brown color.
Smell is yeasty, doughy, malty, slight esters, 
The taste is sweet at first. Seems fruity with cherry, grape, molasses flavors, but the strong alcohol and malty presence covers up those flavors to create a perfect balance. These sweet candy like flavors are also present that are meshed well with the doughy, malty presence that creates an indescribable experience. I felt like I was drinking a deliciously rich piece of cake... I have no idea how. 
Mouthfeel is very warm because of the high ABV. Carbonation is very filling too. 852 charactersgenog, Jul 29, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bottle into my Westvleteren glass, both obtained in Brugges. 
A: Dark brown, with ruby-ish tones when held up to the light. Pours with a decent white head that dissipates slowly. 
S: Fruit is the main aroma - raisins, grapefruit, a hint of caramel. After a little time the caramel and toffee aroma is a little more pronounced. 
T: Similar to the taste, there's a definite fruit presence, however with the taste the sweetness of the malt really comes out. Caramel and toffee are pleasant. Alcohol warming is strong, yet balanced at the end. Lets you know that you're consuming an alcoholic beverage, but not in an unpleasant way. Well balanced with the other flavors. 
M: Solid and smooth, velvety in a way. Not syrupy or watery at all. 
D: High. If only this were not one of the hardest beers to obtain in the world, I would have this available to me on a regular basis. Looks like I just have to go back to Belgium! 935 charactersYonderWanderer, Jul 22, 2007
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Light amber in color, with a small white head, and scattered patches of foam on the glass walls.
Aroma: Profound dark fruit aroma, with a slight spiciness, strong alcohol notes, very appealing.
Taste: Opens with a spicy, dark fruit, and alcohol, fairly sweet. These flavors carry to the end of the taste, where a mild herbal hop bitterness appears, bringing the taste to a well-balanced close. Along the way there are transient flavors, such as bitter chocolate, earthy yeast notes, coffee, and nuts. In all, the flavor profile is remarkably complex and somewhat difficult to do justice to with mere words.
Mouth feel: Smooth, very full, almost syrupy, soft on the palate.
Drinkability/notes: An unwaveringly excellent example of the style, likely unsurpassed in its excellence. I must join the chorus and add that this beer is highly recommended, and worth the steep price that you are likely to pay if purchasing it outside of Belgium.
Many thanks to HardTarget for graciously sharing this rare example. 1,032 charactersPegasus, Jul 21, 2007
4.27/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5200th review
Got as a gift from my best friend who ordered from BelgianShop.com. Poured from a 33cl bottle with a best by date of Oct '09 into my NBB snifter. The color was an reddish brown and had a ton of yeast bits. It had a very small beige head that quickly dissipated. No film, collar or lacing. I thought I had let it warm enough but was just getting to temp when I opened it so the initial aroma was good but not great. After it got to temp (yes I used a cooking thermometer as my wife chuckled at me - screw it, good beer deserves to be treated with respect), the aroma really developed and was exceptional. Was strong on raisins and plum with a sweetness surrounding it all. Could smell the alcohol but it wasn't overpowering so no problem. The taste was really good but didn't live up to the aroma or the hype. It was exceptionally smooth for a quad but just didn't blow me away. I enjoyed it but I've had better quads taste-wise. The mouthfeel was also really good - creamy and smooth. While not the best taste for a quad it was definitely extremely drinkable for a quad - very smooth. I'm going to have to get some more and make sure this sample was up to snuff ;-) Overall, a great beer that you definitely need to try....but it's overhyped in my opinion due to the rareness of it. Get a bottle if you can but don't give the arm and leg for it - just one of em. (4.5, RR, T, Y) 1,392 charactersTexIndy, Jul 16, 2007

S- Hot alcohol comes out first along with some nice esters, raisins, plums, and hints of earthy hops. There is also some Belgian sugar in it as well. 
T- Dark esters, quite a bit of sugar, raisins, some light spices, and sweet caramel malt all came through. 
M- Medium body with really low carbonation.
D- I thought it was a decent beer but no way #1. I think it is quite a lot over hyped. I did this in a blind tasting with St. Bernys 12 and I choose that over this hands down. 581 charactersBlindPig, Jul 11, 2007
4.2/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4i know good and well that i am not going to win any friends by consuming this by lonesome, but i was feeling a little greedy! I had a Alesmith Grand Cru in hand but didnt want a 750ml bottle at this point
So i arrived at this...its somewhat of a big day anyway. I am back in the states after 3 weeks down under, i received word this morning that i passed my final section of the cpa exam, and the cubs came back and beat the brewers 6-5! Plus, the consensus seems to be to drink this beer sooner than later
Thanks a million to lou91 for this bottle
appearance: pours from the innocent looking unlabled brown bottle, gold cap and all marked 13.11.05...poured into a la chouffe tulip. body is a very dark garnet with a light foamy beige head and minimal lacing/retention. there is a fair amount of sediment found at the bottom of the bottle
smell: very powerful aroma...thick caramel malts, earthy cocoa tones, nutty, belgian yeast, a touch of sweet booze...honey, toasted graham crackers...pretty nice
taste: This is a high quality beer, i'm not sure if its a 95 but i probably havent had too many true belgian quads so who knows. profile structure is deep and complex but i get an abrasive alcohol burn pretty immediately. rich and caramel malt structure, belgian yeast, honey, brown sugar, raisin, walnuts, ripe dark fruits highlighted by plum, incredibly spicy that burns the throat a little, toffee, dark chocolate
mouthfeel: big bold and complex...boozy and throat wrenchingly spicy (but not in a bad way)

4.9/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a no label 33 cl. brown bottle with a date on the cap of 22:11:09. Sampled at serving temperature (50-55F), served in a Westvleteren silver rimmed chalice, resting on a Westvleteren coaster. Opened with a BA "The Return of the Belgian Beer Fest" opener. My 73rd review. This review also puts me over 250 "karma points" (i.e. I get my first "mug"). Sampled on 28 June 07 at 0000 UTC. 
The planets have aligned for this moment in time. Might as well "play to the hype" right?
Appearance - Poured with a lively tan creamy head that quickly developed into a two-finger presentation. In my excitement, I almost overpoured. After allowing it to settle a bit, I swirled the remaining and added it to the glass. Dark amber/brown in color. Very hazy/murky as well. The retention/lacing is something I haven't seen before, with the exceedingly small carbonation bubbles gripping the glass with the remaining head being supported/fed from the murky depths. 
Smell - Fruity plum raisin aroma with a refreshing woody/grassy malt presence as well. Very inviting with the anticipation of a crisp clean taste to accompany this wonderful smell. I might say a bit of a caramel aroma as well trying to fight to the front, but the fruit and malt presence takes center stage. 
Taste - Now's the time. Oh my. The complex mixing of plum, raisin and sweet malt that I smelled takes life in the first part of the beer with a smooth molasses and roasted malt/caramel middle as it sits on my tongue. Finishes with light yeast and alcohol presence. I was waiting for the alcohol and it was not overpowering to say the least. 
Mouthfeel - I mentioned earlier about the size of the bubbles. Well, as this ambrosia was transported around my mouth, I could feel those bubbles remaining the same size. So many times I've felt the carbonation almost causing an expansion of the body of the beer, instead of being used as a transport media for the flavors and body. This body was well worth the wait. It was full without relying on the carbonation to bring it to life.
Drinkability - As close to perfection as I've tasted. I would say I would like to see this aged for a bit and then compare it again. I think the drinkability suffers from the lack of access to this beer which then everyone implies perfection, due to feeling as if they may never experience it again.
I've had many quads before. Some of my favorate being: Kasteelbier Brune, Trappistes Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus Abt 12 60th Anniversary. Somehow, this is more than just a good quad this is a good total beer. I'm still savoring it. 2,598 charactersNesued, Jun 29, 2007
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have to admit, I'm excited. I've heard some amazing things and I want to judge it for myself. The mysterious blank brown glass bottle releases a cloudy, deep amber brown with a tight, thick, frothy head characteristic of most quads but with a bit more retention. Unfiltered with plenty of sediment and leaves great lace. 
The aroma is very complex to say the least. Dark fruit (raisin), spice, a bit of apple and citrus in the finish. Not terribly pungent, but as I said, very complex. 
The taste is seamless and implicitly complex with layers of fruit, raisin, malt, spice, toasty bread, toffee, clover honey, and a bit of citrus. A touch of alcoholic warmth rounds everything out. 
Mouthfeel... exquisite. Awesomely smooth and velvety. Great natural carbonation. By far the best texture of any Belgian brew I've ever had. 
As for this being the best beer in the world; that remains to be seen. But as for Quadrupels, there is no comparison. 956 charactersletsgopens, Jun 28, 2007
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to my main man peabody for trading this incomparable elixir to me.
A perfect pour into my Westvleteren goblet yields a 2 finger tan head atop a dark brown, murky, mystical body. Quintessential Belgian lacing coats the glass.
Several intermingling aromas arise from this beer; yeast, cherry, grape, raisin, fig, cappucino, dark malt, spices, molasses, and so much more. To enumerate every note in this beer's aroma would take the nose of a bloodhound and the vocabulary of a thesaurus.
The flavor is just as complex as the smell. Plum, rum, chocolate, fresh bread, grape, pepper, vanilla, again I can't possibly do this justice. Unrivaled.
As one would expect this beer has a mouthfeel smoother than velvet. The carbonation is incredibly fine. Supremely drinkable. 782 charactersillidurit, Jun 27, 2007

Appearance is less than expected, but has a nice head in a tulip. Dark dark dark amber, nearly black.
Smell is a 10. Not a five. A ten. BEST SMELLING BEER EVER. I can't even name every nuance here. I'd try, but I would do the beer an injustice.
Best tasting beer ever. I'm so glad I am drinking this right now. I never believed the hype. Are you sure this is 10.20% abv? Haha, seriously this is amazingly smooth for the abv, the taste is second to none, annnnd... yes, this is the best tasting beer I've ever encountered. BELIEVE THE HYPE.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Perfect carbonation, perfect thickness.

In all reality I scored 12 of these baby's along with some blue cappers and being in the giving mood I have been trading them off left and right.
A: I drank this baby properly from a Westvleteren Chalice. It poured a deep brownish hue that glimmered a wonderful red in the sunlight...Beautiful. A wonderful 2 finger head emerges which quickly fades as tiny bubbles race to the top of the glass.
S: I don't know that I can describe it in words so I will keep it simple Yum! Dark fruits and Molasses with a slight burn of alcohol. I found my self sniffing the bottle as I consumed it.
T: In one word Complex. There is so much going on here yet it seems to be so minimal. Fruit, Dark candied sugar, and earth all compete with each other to come to the forefront. None are too forward though, they are meshed together in such a perfect way. This beer is like the most wonderufl Port Wine I have ever dreamed of consuming. All of this despite the fact that you would never know this tips the charts at over 10% APV May God Bless the Monks of Westvleteren.
M: As a quad you would expect a full bodied brew, and this lives up to that. If does not stop there though. It has a certain richness to it, creamyness, its chewy but balanced.
D: Let's be real. This is to be consumed one Chalice at a time. Cost and rareness of this beer make it a real treat to consume. This beer is so much about experience that you would never want to devalue that by having 2 in a row. That being said the beer is heavenly. 
Overall: This one took me back to my vacation in Belgium. Touring the Abbey's eating cheese, mingling, a snap shot of pure happiness in life. This $12 bottle of beer helped me to think back and relive one of the greatest experiences in life. Is it to late to step away from life and check into Westvleteren to devote my life to beer? Those Monks know what they are doing and they do it oh so well. 2,062 characterstpd975, Jun 16, 2007
4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A big thanks to Delerium for giving me the opportunity to sample this great brew.
Poured a cloudy dark brown with a one-finger creamy head that dissipated quickly, leaving scattered bubbles on the surface.
Aromas of toasted malt, raisins and plums. Very earthy, with a little chocolate, toffee and molasses. Only a hint of the alcohol content. Very complex: too much to discern at one time.
The taste was every bit as complex as the aroma: dark fruit, molasses, sweet malts balanced with bitter hops. For such a strong beer, the alcohol was not at all harsh.
Mouthfeel was rich and creamy; medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation.
An easily drinkable beer, but definitely something to be savored, not rushed. I look forward to the next chance I get to enjoy this incredible beer. Hopefully that chance may come soon! 839 charactersMrMonkey, Jun 15, 2007

Mmm tastes like hype. A brown body with red rimmed highlights and a decent white head of small bubbles. The smell is close to unappealing to me my friend really likes it but to me the alcohol pops out and there is a cooked raisin smell that sends this sideways. The taste is decent it has depth of flavor and the yeast adds some nice edges of phenol with lots of dried fruit and some caramel with even a touch of more mellow dark malt and then the alcohol comes through warming all it touches. Good mouthfeel full but not too dense. Something to have once in a while when you can find it but not my favorite, shrug, once again this is mostly hype. 757 charactersHigravity, Jun 14, 2007

4.5/5.0 - Appearance- Poured into a wide-mouthed chalice this most wonderous beer appears a medium brown with a slightly reddish tint. The head is composed of an interesting combination of very small champagne-like bubbles and largish bubbles scattered throughout. Head is what I'd consider to be perfect size upon pour- about 2 fingers worth. Dissipates slowly leaving lots of brussels lace behind as the head dwindles to a thin cover on the top.
5.0 - Smell- Here's where you know the hype is justified. The gas released from the opening of this bottle was amazing... almost not sure where to start... Fruity with leanings towards raisins and raspberries. Subtle (all of the following) molasses, honey, clover, blueberry, toasted malt, plums, figs, sour apple, muted eathy notes, inviting alcohol that you would never guess is 10.2% ABV. Oh, and a bit of a maple syrup smell as well. Is there anything I missed? probably
5.0 - Taste- To sum it up: incredible. Brown sugar, molasses, at times- banana, very subtle yet balancing hops have a piney characteristic, grapes, a warming alcohol(yet very subdued), honey, figs, toasted malt (that I would liken to toasted marshmallows on a somewhat sticky night with fireworks in the background), raisins, and a definite yeasty/earthy characteristic that is particularly strong and lingering at the finish
Endlessly complex. I could probably list off a ton more characteristic, but I'd like to finish this review sometime before sun-up... literally- it's 4:45am.
5.0 -Mouthfeel- Rich and creamy. Full bodied and full-flavored, yet somehow it rolls so gently across the palate that it seems almost thin at times. Perfect carbonation gives a nice feel right down to the very last sip.
5.0 - Drinkability- Despite all the complexities of this beer, I could easily guzzle this in a heartbeat, but I never would because I know it's too hard to get and every sip should be savored. I enjoyed this beer by itself, but I can only imagine what it would be like paired with a simply, yet delicious monk-like meal- I was thinking just simple rice at the time of drinking. Not sure why... I've got 5 bottles left of 3 different vintages... I am hooked and want more. 2,317 characterslpayette, Jun 13, 2007

The beer poured out a hazy dark brown with a french vanilla colored notable head. A few whiffs of it almost blew me away. I was able to detect chocolate, toffee, caramel, raisin, and peaches. Of course now I was really looking for to the taste, and it did not disappoint. I could taste maple, caramel, toffee, and butterscotch. The mouthfeel was very full and creamy. 
This beer lives up to the hype - of course I could drink tons of these. Too bad I may never get to Belgium. 618 characterswestweasel, Jun 08, 2007

4.39/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Split a bottle with my wife on May 31st (the occasion: her job promotion); date stamped 22.11.09, meaning it's a little over 6 months old. Poured into a couple goblets at somewhere around 50F.
A: Rich, sepia-toned brown with auburn highlights. I poured carefully into both glasses, although the first was significantly less cloudy/yeast-filled than the murky second one. The head never developed much, never more than a 1/2" of creamy tan, then fading almost completely. Lacing was small beaded rings. 
S: Ultra-complex. I enjoyed this from the first sniff; after sufficient warming, found myself mutely inhaling and savoring this aroma. It was fun sharing this one with my wife because her keen sense of smell (though mine's getting much better) was picking up notes I was troubling over. Together we came up with: molasses, honey, cloves, candi sugar, toasted grain, dark chocolate, plum, cinnamon, black tea, currants, and an undeniable yeastiness that we both agreed "smells like Belgium".
T: Did I mention complexity? There's so much going on in this beer - flavors are cascading across the tongue in waves. Much of what was detected in the aroma is found in the taste, although I was surprised a bit by the depth of dark spices and bitterness. That effervescent tea/clove flavor was one of the first things I picked up on, but generally the spices were less sweet and more akin to ground cinnamon stick, nutmeg and to reduced (i.e. slightly burnt) caramel or molasses. Quite tasty but currently a little harsh, we're hopeful some more age will help mellow the intensity.
M: Pleasantly carbonated with a medium-full mouthfeel. Spices leave a lingering tingle on the tip of the tongue and a velvety alcohol warmth leaves the cheeks feeling a little fuzzy.
D: An excellent beer, no doubt. Worth the hype, if not the crazy lengths some people go to to obtain the #1-ranked beer in the world. Incredibly complex, fantastic aroma, nice experience overall. Can't wait for the next occasion to have another... 2,012 charactersmsubulldog25, Jun 02, 2007
3.71/5  rDev -19.5%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I was overly excited when a buddy of mine bought a case of this and we were to have it for our final beer club beer #500. This beer poured a dark amber haze with a sizeable head. Smelled slightly sweet with a little spice and apple juice notes. Starts off with spiced apple juice, some sweet brown sugar flavors, dark dried fruit flavors, a little more spice and hints of lemon at the end of every few sips. More alcohol warmth than I would have liked. It overpowered some of the flavors and stood out more as the beer warmed. A very full flavored beer but not as good as I was expecting. In fact I favor several quads and trippels over this brew. It was worth the money to say you have had one, but I would never pay the high price to have this beer again. The rarity gives this beer extremely too much credit. 811 charactersdren, May 29, 2007

12 oz bottle
Capped 10/30/09 (bottled 06),found God 05/07
Moderate pour in a tulip glass.
Poured a very murky dark brown with a moderate to large frothy mostly to fully lasting beige head.
Smelt of moderate to strong plums, raisins, vinous, with light cinnamon, cloves, caramel, mushroom yeastiness.
First sip was like an injection of Godliness. My tastebuds got shocked all the way into my spine. Upfront moderate sweet bitter and light sour everything followed by a strong bitter yeast moss and moderate sweetness on a long finish.
Palate was medium to full bodied, softly carbonated, creamy and slightly alcoholic.
Overall, the nose does not do it justice. It tastes like mystery and is so beautifully balanced throughout, it is dangerously drinkable for a quad. Godliness in a bottle. 822 charactersxav33, May 29, 2007

Enticing, sweetish aroma. Color is dark, murky brown. Pours with a big, white head. Sweet malt flavor up front closely followed by a balancing hit of bitterness. Rich complex malt, hop bitterness and complex fruit flavors dance in my mouth. The attack on my tastebuds is incredible. This beer has a long lingering finish that just won't quit. There's also a touch of alcohol warmth to the finish. I love the balance of this beer. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. Delicious! I wish I had more. 548 charactersohmybock, May 29, 2007

Pours a nice small head that falls into a thin layer with a great lacing that's very strong. Color is dark brown almost red. The smell is spiced with clove, cinnamin, brown sugar with a backround of Belgian Candy sugar. There's also dark fruit like plum. Taste is slightly sweet with dark fruit and spices. Mouthfeel is a little hot still. Mouthfeel is smooth, just a little hot. Overall this is a nice beer to have once in a while.

4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to Matthew at Capone's for selling this beauty to me. Thought this beer would be an appropriate selection for my 100 BA review.
Paired this beer with the Rochefort 10 (a beer I'm pretty familiar with), just for a reference point. I don't want to suggest the Westy blew the Rochefort out of the water, but the difference was pretty striking.
Considering what this beer had undoubtedly been through coming into my hands, it was incredibly fresh and lively. The beer poured an impressive cloudy, amber red color, with excellent head retention. There isn't a huge amount of foam, but what there is lasts and lasts. Very nice lacing throughout my tasting of this beer.
The nose is incredibly complex and, like the taste itself, continued to change the longer it sat in the glass. Initially I got lots of Belgium spice and orange citrus in the nose (but much more subtle then the type of citrus you'd get in an IPA), with a hint of sweetness. Later, this turned to an aroma of cherry, ginger and chocolate. The flavor profile replicated the nose, but was even more complex. Initial flavors were of melon, pear and cherry; later on I started to get flavors of ranier cherry, chocolate, butter and a hint of licorise. Later still there was a cola flavor (not unlike the Bernadus abt 12, a beer I have heard this beer likened to) intermixed with the cherry and chocolate. The beer is amazingly supple on the palate, and oh so easy to drink. 
This beer is a joy to drink, though it was nothing like what I expected. I guess I sort of expected a Belgium version of the Thomas Hardy or JW Lee, but it was nothing like that. This beer is incredibly light on it's feet for such a big beer, and was way too easy to drink. It finishes with a whisper, a very smooth, satisfying end to a nearly flawless beer. Most excellent. 1,831 charactersJohn_M, May 23, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Westy goblet at Cafe Gollem in Amsterdam. Served at cellar temp from the cellar of the cafe. I paid 12 euro for it, but it didnt matter; this was the first time I was ever able to get my hands on this beer. Despite the fact that I have been wanting to try this beer for a long time, I reviewed it as unbiasedly as possible (I am confident I acheived this); attempting to forget the name on the top of the cap.
A - A gorgeous beer. Deep orange brown. There was minimal head that faded pretty fast, no lacing. I knocked it slightly for that, but minimal lacing and head are to be expected in bigger beers like quadrupels.
S - This beer has a huge aroma.A big sweet/malty smell with hints of figs and prunes. A touch of caramel and tobacco as well. 
T - This is a fine beer, it tastes similar to smell described above. A big malty presence assaults your tastebuds. Has a fruity character as well that wasnt apparent in the nose. Also has a nice touch of yeast to it as well and a different salty character at the finish. A complex quadrupel.
M - Lightly carbonated and slick. The taste on this lingers forever, it dosent want to quit. And again there is this salty finish on the tounge
D - The 5 a give for drinkability is maybe where a slight bit of bias creeps in. I dont want to quit drinking this beer. It is exceptional and very well rounded. I am in a great cafe, in a foreign country, drinking an exceptional beer.
I suppose this is where I say whether or not the beer lives up to the hype. For me it is not the best beer in the world. However it is the best quadrupel I have ever tried. It blows St. bernardus away and narrowly edges Rochefort. This is truly a fine beer, and the rareness of it makes it a treat to seek out. The feeling a got when i finally was able to find one was bliss. For that factor the beer deserves a five.
In short - best quadrupel I have ever had, though that might only get it into my top 15 or so beers. 1,972 charactersIPAcraig, May 22, 2007

My 100th review. How appropriate. Bought this to celebrate the completion of the first year of my MBA.
Appearance: Translucent mahogany/toffee with subtle ruby highlights. A creamy off-white head - finger-thick. Excellent lacing
Smell: Earthy, with a distinct spicy belgian yeast aroma. some red wine fruitiness embedded as well as a candy-like sweetness. Some beers try to be everything and fall on their faces, but somehow this can present a myriad of facets and do it flawlessly.
Taste: Big malt up front and an initially sweet/floral taste that mingles with raisins and figs. Absolutely wonderful aftertaste brought about by subtle hop bitterness combined with a bright fruitiness. Some alcohol warming, but it's very subdued and wonderfully hidden. Peppery spiciness throughout. Just fantastic.
Mouthfeel: Smooth like Barry White. Full and creamy but not overly heavy. Can't beat it.
Drinkability: Well-hidden alcohol and a divinely complex flavor profile? Drink on! 1,092 characterskpantz, May 16, 2007

Lots of levels of dark fruit, berries, desserts, candies. Specifically chocolates, pastries, malt, blackberries, cherrys, and many others that just goes on and on. Some yeastiness. Very balanced despite its rich fullness. Could dwell on this endlessly so much going on. Velvety texture, reminds me of what a mink jock must be like.

Expiration date 24/05/09, small capped bottle.
It is hard to describe this one, and add something to the other notes. My first sip was actually disappointing, I was probably expecting something to blow my socks away, and it did not, at least immediately. The second sip, third sip, and it keeps changing.
Beautiful looking brownish, hazy brew with red hues, and a much more generous, light tan head than other trappists, with very good retention.
Nose is impressive as well, and it improved remarkably as it warmed up; sweetish, fruity, earthy, and multiple other aromas.
Interestingly enough, alcohol is one thing I could barely notice on the aroma.
The mouthfeel is full, velvety but not overly "heavy". Taste is multi-faceted, mellow and sweetish, fruity, earthy and even at times bitter, but never overly sweet like Rochefort, for example, can sometimes get.
After a few minutes with this beer, it struck me, for its complexity and wonderful, sweetish taste without being overfilling. The alcohol is barely noticeable, making this the only beer in tis class I could actually have more than one.
A true masterpiece! 1,170 charactersbrdc, Apr 27, 2007

the nose was a variety of smells ranging from earthy notes to sweet fruity aromas.
taste was slightly earthy with a slight bitterness in the finish. also present was a mellow fruitiness, that ranged from dates and raisins/ to grape bubblegum. very complex, and the mouthfeel was INCREDIBLE. full bodied, and velvety, but not syrupy or cloying...very pleasant.
drinkability: the abv is not noticeable as in the rochefort 10 (although not a bad thing in the 10)
very easy to drink, but i would definitely stave off from drinking 2 in one night. better to save it for another joyous occasion. 855 charactersOutlawJoseyWales, Apr 22, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewing this beer is a momentous occasion in my life. A bottle was purchased for me from eBay, and sent from the Netherlands. My friends did this for me as a graduation present, and I am again very thankful.
The bottle cap reads 22.11.09, which I understand is the "expiration date," three years after the bottling. So, this is a fairly new bottle.
I pour the beer into my Westvleteren goblet, which has been in my possession for a year or more, awaiting this moment. Carefully decanting, the ale raises a creamy, light tan two-finger head. It seems to fall at a fairly fast rate, but when the majority of large bubbles have burst, it settles to a thick and creamy one-finger layer. The head retention is simply fantastic; it resembles that of a nitro stout. The beer leaves almost no lacing as I move the head about the glass before taking my first sip, as if it's quite heavy. Throughout the whole glass, there's virtually no trace of lacing on the sides. The beer's body is dark brown, but yields up ruby-copper light when directly back lit. 
The nose has a dark fruity scent that I pick up in a lot of other Belgians, but there's also a bit of toasted caramel and a touch of acidity mingled with the fruit. I'm even reminded of a less sweet pecan pie, although I can't 100% support this claim, it just feels right. There's also a noticeable grape aroma. I admit that I would prefer this to be stronger, but my sense of smell has always been weak. A great blend of scents, though. I read in another review about the odor of earth, and I didn't notice it at first. But, as the beer approached room temperature, I could pick it up. Very interesting and complex, this beer, which has me raising the nose from a 4.5.
The taste is heady, woody, a bit acidic, and has fruit flavors lead by grape. In some ways, it tastes like a red wine with an incredible body. There are even elements of wood that are in the same vein as a Shiraz, but more balanced with the other taste components. It has a sweetness to it that lasts the whole way through, leaving its mark on my lips. The hops have a metallic feel to them, akin to what I've tasted in every altbier I've had. However, the hops are not overbearing as they often are in alts. I swear I smell caramel, but I only notice a bit of toastiness here. At the very end of the aftertaste, there lingers just a slight sourness, which is indeed pleasant. The taste has a lightness to it, despite its complexity. Oh, and as I said earlier, it's heady, but not in a painful way, just noticeable. By the way, pouring in what little yeast there was didn't make a noticeable difference in the flavor.
The body, the mouth of Westy 12, is truly balanced. For a quadrupel, it is more like a rapier than a claymore. The mouth is of medium thickness, with fine carbonation that just livens up the liquid. It moves easily in the mouth..
Having had Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12, I can say that this is far and above the champion. It has complexity without being overpowering, and drinkability without too much weight. It's an elegant beer that I'm overjoyed to have been afforded the chance to try.
As I said above, this beer, as a gift, might force me to rate it above its true worth. I worried about that a bit, but Westy 12 lives up to all of the hype. A marvel of brewing. Plus, it adds to the pride of being Catholic just a bit more! 3,392 charactersmjc410, Apr 19, 2007
4.48/5  rDev -2.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Definitely a very, very good beer. I would not go so far as to say that it is the best beer. That being said, it was a tremendous joy to drink, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to do so.
If I read the cap properly, then this was vintage 2003. Wow.
A: Pours reddish-brown with great lacing.
S: Smells of alcoholic warmth and raisins. Actually, it smelled very "dignified," if that makes any sense at all. The smell reminded me of cognac.
T: It tastes the way it smells, with sweet raisins and warm alcohol. Some other non-specific fruits in the background. The alcohol is definitely present. Again, sort of like a cognac. This is a tremendous beer. However, in a blind taste-test against Rochefort 10, for example, it would be a toss-up. While a very impressive offering, I guess I was expecting something more, given this beer's reputation.
M: Mouthfeel was good, although I would've liked it maybe a little thicker. It seemed to work quite well for this style.
D: I want another. Too bad it'll be quite some time. And at a steep price.
Again, this is an awesome beer. I encourage you to try it. But I was expecting it to be far and away the best. 1,170 charactersBoppar, Mar 29, 2007
4.54/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Austere, unlabeled brown glass bottle with "Trappistenbier" embossed around the neck. Gold cap with location information, brewery name, ABV, and small 12. A date that appears to be 07.06.03 is printed over the cap text in the hardest possible place to read-- get with the program, monks.
Pours dark, cloudy brown with loads of sediment and no head to speak of. The aroma is pretty complex-- belgian yeast, esters, some medicinal phenols, dark fruit, mixed malts, and some port-type wininess.
Tastes like it smells: awesome. Esters and malt are even more pronounced, with just a little candi sugar. Phenols and wine notes appear mid-palate. Wininess persists to the finish, where some berry flavors and maybe diacetyl show up. Some alcohol flavor, but not overwhelming.
It's been talked up a little, but damn is it exquisite.
The mouthfeel is modestly chewy, lightened by the port wine flavor. Balanced as hell.
Even setting aside the fact that I had to give up both kidneys, three of my girlfriend's ova, and my firstborn to get it, this beer is a sipper. It drinks like a fine cognac, and if I read the date on my bottle properly, it ages just as well.
EDIT: I recently found out that the date on the cap is a freshness date, marked for three years after the date of bottling. So this was vintage 2000. Wow. It was probably madeirized, but whatever it was, it was fantastic. 1,393 characterskajerm, Mar 29, 2007

S - Smell is really hard to pin down. There is soo much going on here I really do not know where to begin. It was sweet yet sour, spicey and yet fruity. A bit of alcohol mixed in with hints of pears, apples, raisins, grapes, everything. This was really just soo complex I had trouble finding definate answers. Very very pleasing aroma, nothing ever smelt like that.
M & T - The feel on this was soo light,	soo frothy, soo easy to put down it was almost a shame that it went soo quickly. Soo many great tastes here, this was just really fantastic. There have been soo many reviews of this that I really don't have anything else to add other then you have to try it, it just cannot be summed up in words on this page.	
D - This really was everything I wanted it to be, and lives up to its rep. By far the best belgian I have had, it is just on another level. The aromas and flavors were so unique. This really just needs to be tried as it is really hard to describe it. Fantastic brew. 1,158 charactersmikesgroove, Mar 28, 2007
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought a few of these from Beer Mania when I was in Brussels last year. I had one immediately and cellered the other. I noticed it tasted better fresher than it did older, I had to give it a 4.5 on taste for that.
The beer pours from the bottle a mahogany color that is slightly less intense than say a Rocheforte 10. Nice thick head that leaves lacing on the glass. Flavor is of raisins, caramal, malts, maple syrup in the background, and a alcohol bite that is well within line for the high alcohol. It has a long finish, a sustain like a Gibson Les Paul, yeah this beer goes to eleven. 591 charactersbensiff, Mar 25, 2007
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle carried back from the monastery and cellared for 1 1/2 years. Pours a completely opaque, very dark brown with a dense, rocky head that leaves nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Smells of candied fruits, plums and raisins with a orange note in the background and a dusky, rich aroma throughout. Taste? A 5 doesn't do it justice. Fruits up front, mellowing into an incredibly smooth malt, followed by nice tannins and then a sharp but mellow aftertaste. It has a nice warming alcohol finish but nothing harsh anywhere in this beer. The mouthfeel is oily and chewy, dense and spectacular. The drinkability is only limited by the availability. We bought a case of this in Belgium and went through it like shit through my dog after he's gotten into the trash. I hate to just jump on the bandwagon but this really does live up to its reputation. This is quite possibly the best beer I've ever had and is just a testament to what brewing can be. Hallelujah! 961 charactersroblowther, Mar 24, 2007

Ok... The westy poured out a soft dark velvety brown with a light caramel colored frothy head, sticky lacing slides down the sides. The nose offers deep wood notes, prune, chocolate, caramel, sweet toffee, cherry, maple syrup, mollasses, and lots of other sticky sweet flavors. The taste starts off with all of those sticky sweet notes, mostly maple syrup, caramel, sticky bun, then goes sharp for a moment before descending into chocolate, some anise, a little wood, and some faint orange? Wow. The mouthfeel is clean and prickly, finishing super clean, not cloying at all in any way. Immensely and dangerously drinkable. 663 charactersdherling, Feb 28, 2007

S: Complicated smells... Raisins, plumbs seem to dominate, then there are other smells that come to me every few sips.

4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Decided that the ol' Westy 12 was worthy of my 500th beer review. 330 mL bottle which I found at the Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville over a year ago - 14/9/07 ink-jet printed on the cap. It pours a deep brownish/red that is crimson in the light, but I didn't decant carefully enough as there is a lot of yeast in suspension. It has light carbonation and a half-inch head that leaves some nice lacing. The aroma is quite nice, vinous and sweet, with ripe grapes and raspberries, figs, apples, pine?, cookie batter?, and doughy yeast. It tastes of sweet and toasted, lightly smoky malts, green hops, a medium bitterness, melon, green apple, raspberry, strawberry?, a flash of banana, a light herbal quality, Belgian yeast, and very light oxidation in the form of paper. It has light, smooth carbonation on the palate, with a medium, drying body that becomes more full and leaves a medium to long finish. It is both immensely drinkable and a very nice ale, but my bottle was a bit past its prime. I would love to taste a fresh one purchased directly from the abbey - I imagine that is a divine experience. Best beer in the world? Perhaps not, but it's a beautifully crafted Trappist that is worth at least half of the hype that surrounds it. 1,240 charactersmmmbeer, Feb 13, 2007
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Recieved in a trade from a good trader, whose name I will withhold to prevent him from constantly being beermalied. Thanks for letting me try this one.
Pours from an unlabeled bottle a deep brown, almost black color with nice ruby highlights, and a two finger head. Great retention, but only moderate lacing.
Aroma is dominated by fresh baked bread, biscuits, and bread yeast. Very little yeasty aromas, and only a hint of the flavor to come.
Flavor is complex, enjoyable, yet subtle. Up front, there is some caramel like sweetness from the malts, and big esters of figs and plums. Chocolate covered and rum soaked cherries come to mind. It also reminds me a bit of fine old scotch, even though there are no smokey flavors. Very spirit like in flavor, but without any real alcohol presence. The finish switches to a dry chocolate malt type flavor, that is clean, and does not linger very long on the finish. Very well balanced, and very subtle. This is not a huge in your face type of flavor, but a very well constructed one. Mouthfeel hits a home run... up front it is very thick and heavy, almost like warm honey. But on the finish, the mouthfeel thins out a bit, and does not leave you with a cloying feeling left in your mouth. This is aided by tiny bubbles of aggressive carbonation. Drinkability is excellent.
Is this a great beer? Yes. Is it worth trying if you can get it? Yes. Is it worth the hype? Not really. Is it worth the $30+ that some people pay for it? I don't think so.
While this is a damn fine beer, this is not the beer to end all other beers. It is very good, well crafted, and delicate in its approach, but it is not deserving of the incredible hype it gets. In this country, we are blessed to have a wide selection of great belgian style beers. St. Bernardus Abt. 12, Rochefort 10, Kasteel, and Gouden Carolus Grand Cru are all also excellent beers that are similar to the famous "westy", but they don't have the huge hype associated with them. This is every bit as good as those other beers, but I can't say for sure if it's "better". I'd say that it is worth all the praise for being as good as it is, but it's not worth the hype and longing for it. I can now see why the brothers decided to stop selling it here. If you can get it, try it.... but it's not worth trading your first born for. Be happy with what we have here. 2,363 charactersphisig137, Feb 11, 2007

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have been waiting for an occasion to finally enjoy this one, and that day has come. 
Appearance: Very murky medium to dark body, capped with a big off-whte head that is very sticky and resilient. There is great lacing, and a creamy layer on top of the beer long after the pour.
Smell: Fruity and musty, alcohol and hard candy. Smells sweet and very smooth.
Taste: Maybe not of this world, has a slightly spicy flavor from the alcohol (black pepper), Sweet like pineapple and pear, but the hops are definitely not lost in this one. Everything blends, separates, repeats over and over it seems. This is the best quadrupel I have ever had, most likely best beer in the world.
Drinkability: This beer did not disappoint, start to finish, it lived up to the hype. I wish getting another one would be a little easier. 825 charactersTastyTaste, Feb 08, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Today is my birthday, and my present to myself is to open a bottle of Westvleteren 12. It's pretty green though, about 4 months old at this point based on a best buy date of 10/11/09 (converted to american format). I poured a bottle into a chimay glass. 
It pours a very dark brown. It isn't black, but light barely penetrates. There is a nice mocha colored head that hangs around for a while and laces nicely down the glass leaving patches of foam on the surface of the beer. 
The aroma is great. It has a raisin and rich toffee aroma with a malty background. It is very sweet and there is another aroma on top of the raisins I can't quite place that might be caramelized brown sugar.
I have heard so much about this beer that I almost though it would fall short of my expectations. Fortunately, that was not the case. This is a great beer. The first thing that hits me is the insane level of smoothness and creaminess. For a Belgian Quad, it is ridiculous. In no way can I detect any of the 10.2% alcohol in this beer. I don't consider myself a good enough beer taster to break down all the flavors in this, but I get a pretty strong chocolate flavor and a bit of spiciness as well.
The feeling of this beer is great. It has great body, but not as heavy as a stout would be. I would consider it to be medium bodied but the complexity adds so much to the mouthfeel.
In case you couldn't figure it out from the rest of the review, the drinkability is extremely high. I'm gonna have to start calling in all my favors from friends with belgian contacts. 1,566 charactersdrseamus, Feb 07, 2007
3.52/5  rDev -23.6%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5From a well kept bottle of 4 years age. Poured a dark cola brown, and had little head or aroma. Slight aroma of dark fruit and maple, and flavor was similar. No oxidative notes, or any hint of staleness/ skunkiness etc. so I am sure this beer was well kept. I just don't get what the big deal is. this is my second try from a different batch a couple years after I had my first one, and the impression it has on me is consistent. Of course I did like the mouthfeel and finish that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but these were not very enchanting or beguiling - just vaguely pleasant. I suspect people just hype it up in their minds because it is so rare, and expensive. Highly coveted due to to its scarcity. Sorry if you are an offended devotee, but the emperor wears no clothes on this one. Someone said they are better fresh - I suppose I should try that before the final judgement. 890 charactersdedrinker, Feb 07, 2007

Appearance:
Normal hiss as the cap is removed, nothing special yet. Pours a deep dark brown with a quarter inch of tight tan head that settles slowly and laces the goblet nicely.	
Aroma:
Bread, brown sugar, ripe figs and a faint whiff of alcohol.	
Taste/Mouthfeel:
This is the first beer I've given pause before drinking, because I'm so nervous after all the buildup, anyway, time to dive in. Creamy effervescent mouthfeel imparted by decent carbonation levels.	Flavors of belgian candied sugar are interspersed with fresh dark fruit flavors, a taste of rum cake emerges as well due to the combo of bready yeast and mild alcohol notes creeping in.	
Notes:
This is a good beer, a great beer perhaps, but it can't hold a candle to the hype that has been built around it. IMHO the Westvletere 8 is a better beer. I'm glad that I've now experienced the so called "nirvana" of beer even if I did spend a small fortune to get my hands on it. 1,087 characterscbl2, Feb 04, 2007

A - Very dark - Dark Amber. Wonderfull head retention and lacing
S - Plums, rasins, toffee, and beautiful alcohol phenols, anise, honey backed with mild malt character and spices
T - Alcohol & dark fruits fuse into a delecate flavour of complex malt characters. Wonderfull complex stages of alcohol, dark fruits, dark candy, and some earthen yeast flavours. this beer so wonderfully complex and yet so very drinkable. Alcohol is strong but only assists in drinkablility, adds a spicy, warming and slightly dry element. As the complex malts leave a soft floral hop bitterness is present leaving a slightly dry mouth and soft bitterness.
M - Bloody outstanding, thick and sticky, very soft in the mouth, fluffy. All assisting to make this so easy to finish. Carbonation is perfect.
D - So very easy to drink, smooth and complex, warming alcohol flavour carries this beer down with ease. Utterly hard to falt truly without a doubt one of the best beers in the world. 1,005 charactersFinite, Jan 24, 2007
4.83/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I didn't want to review this one when I first tried it a year+ ago.
Reason for this was the date on the bottles indicated they were fairly new.
I had read other reviews that mentioned how the brew had gotten much better after a year of aging.
So, I did what any sensible Beer Advocate would do. Tried one IMMEDIATELY and then saved some for down the road.
Well, I tried one at 6 months and now a year+ later tried another one.
Since this beer left such a unique impression on me right away I didn't need to be reminded what it tasted like.
So my impression comparison is based on the difference betwene the young brewed version vs the aged versions.
The Westvleteren 12 is more invasive when it is young. By invasive I mean that the alchohol/phenol elements can take alot of the sweetness off the beginning. The young one assaults your palate and if you are not very verse in beer tasting you WILL NOT understand what is going on. To top this off the different subtle flavors get lost in the potency of the crispness of the young brew. You will be trying to taste it but its too much. You WILL know its a 11-12% alcohol content but will also be surprised how well the brew works with the potency.
Your tongue can pick out flavors but its a wild ride.
Now onto the 6 month and 12 month aged brews.
Here is where the trappist craft starts to show up.
Both the 6 and 12 month aged brews (aged in a wine fridge at 40f) were less invasive then the young brew and to top it off the natural carbonation crispness is reduced a bit.
A - Young brew poured into the westy12 glass and the 6 and 12 month poured into my favorite beer glass, the russian river drinking glass, the brew shows up a dark deep ruby red with an off white head. Again the head was about 1 finger and didn't seem to be much different then the young brew.
S - The smell of the aged brews were each less alcoholic in presence and the real berry and chocolate in fresh cracked warm bread smell shows up great. I would smell it throughout the session amazed at the different characteristics.
T - The taste is astounding at the 12 month mark. I would say if you tried a young version of this to do yourself a favor and wait for a year and give it a go. Its the same beer you had but with a much richer and greater range of flavor and the finish leaves you with an even greater need to lift it back to your mouth. The 12 month old one had me begging to slug it down like I would a glass of water after a 5 mile run in the desert. The taste starts out with berrys then moves into the breads and finally levels out feeling as though you had just swallowed a chocolate covered cherry.
M - Mouthfeel is another characteristic that changes alot with aging. I would say after my initial year run that young, 6 and 12 month versions would leave me to believe that a 9 month aged bottle would be the perfect balance between the crispness in carbonation vs phenolic nose. Not flat and still a little edge in the wash.
D - Very few crafted beers make me want to slam them all the way through. Usually I would want to sip them and enjoy the flavor with the occasional mouth slug to accomodate the medium cooked mustard cheese burger. This Westvleteren 12 is really hard to leave alone. Its a trappist that you could easily call a session beer IF you could get over the rareness and your liver can hack the alcohol % since it is hidden well from the senses after a year of aging. The young Westy 12 will make you sip it. Its invasive and still tastes great but the aged one was not asking me to use caution. It was mellowed out and finally the whole idea comes together for, easily, the finest quad on the planet. 3,704 charactersIrishCowboy, Jan 16, 2007
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my first review for BA so I'm starting at the very top. This is an absolutely stunning beer. Still awaiting the Westvleteren Chalice that a dear friend has waiting in the wings for me, in the meantime I decanted this delight into my trusty Westmalle Chalice and allowed it to warm for a little while before eagerly tasting...
The initial spicy chocolate attack of this darkest of nectars is overwhelming enough but just as you're feeling rather impressed, the flavours just amplify .. and amplify ... dark cocoa, cinammon, rich mollasses, and then the 10.2% kicks in with it's own symphony of pleasure before the faintest of hoppy bitterness lingers on ... a truly amazing experience that had me slowing down in ultimate reverance! 
Two days earlier I tasted the Westvleteren 8 which I found to be an equally impressive, although a creamier brew. On a very special night sometime soon, I would like to try them back to back or do a blindfold test with a Rochefort 10 in the mix... I think I'll know the Westy 12 !! 1,028 charactersHabanero58, Jan 15, 2007

Poured deep ruby, crystal shiny in the glass but 1/2" of yeasties in the bottle. Lots of grape wine in the nose, sweet fruity, not dominant. Very nice taste, more like a wine than a beer, lots of heavy fruity grape notes. Tight carbonation and dense mouthfeel. Slight alcohol burn in the end. I could drink this all night long but, seriously, it's not that much better than Trappistes Rochefort 10. If I can get another one I'll do a blind side by side with the 10. Very good but not the best beer in the world. 632 characterskirok1999, Jan 04, 2007

Broke out the trusty Westmalle chalice. There is no label, just a cap to let you know what you are drinking.
Color is ruby brown, the head consists of shimmering, tight, brown bubbles, which take there time fading to a solid thin layer. 
The aroma is intoxicating, yet hard to describe. I get dark fruits, molasses, toffee, brown sugar, cherry...
One sip is enough for me to believe the hype. This one is a 5 plain and simple, I'm just going to enjoy the rest of this now... 690 charactersReebShorts, Jan 03, 2007

This is my first time having this particular beer so I figured there is no better time to try it than to help ring in the new year. The smell is extremely aromatic and is simply fantastic! There are a lot of dark malty fruits (plums and raisins), Belgian yeast and bread. The taste is slightly spicy malt, fresh dark bread and a lingering warming from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with medium-low carbonation. No doubt that this is certainly a world class beer that is extremely well crafted. Now that I have had both the 12 and 8, I actually enjoy the Westy 8 even more than it's big brother. 681 characterscjgator3, Jan 01, 2007
4/5  rDev -13.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours dark brown with a decent size tan head that slowly recedes. A light perfuminess mixes with sweet ripe fruitiness in the aroma. Raisin, plums, and figs, a caramel breadiness as well. Taste is a mix of chocolate and more of the ripe fruity maltiness mix with belgian sugars and sugar cane flavors. There is a crisp peppery hoppiness that begins mid taste and blends with a warming alcohol and some smokiness in the finish. Medium to heavy in body. Besides the warmth in the finish, alcohol is very well balanced, peppery bitterness helps to cut the richness from the malts. Easy to drink, I look forward to seeing what some age does to this one. 649 charactershoppymeal, Jan 01, 2007
4.79/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I don't really like Quads.
But I've always insisted that for every style there is one beer that will radically change your perception of the style and make you fall in love with it.
Westy 12 is that beer.
The head just won't die and the beer is a pleasant plum colour.
The smell, well, words fail me. There is simply too much going on to really accurately describe. If I had to choose a smell, I would say chestnut. But there are hints of mint, chocolate, plums, pears -- a veritable cornucopia of smells.
The taste follows smell. At first there is a strong nutty presence (chestnuts, definately) with baker's chocolate, plums, pears, you know, all the stuff I described in the smell section. The finish is outstanding: there is a quick 'minty' taste from continental hops that clears the palate and leaves room for the rich taste of cinnamon, allspice, and clove. It manages to be sweet and bitter at the same time. Such a wonderful contrast. So much going on here, words fail.
I've really disliked the mouthfeel of other Quads. I guess I'm gonna have to give the style another shot. This mouthfeel is actually quite pleasant, I think largely because the finish is nice.
Drinkability? This is good. A single bottle will take me a long time to finish and it is unlikely that I would want to reach for another, but man, what a beer.
I'm a believer. 1,371 charactersshbobdb, Dec 29, 2006
4.84/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52006 - Pours a deep, rich medium brown color with sherry red accents and a voluminous tan, thick head which dissipates fairly quickly. A lot of suspended yeast flecks visible as well. Heavy lacing in the oversized goblet into which this fine ale is poured. The nose is outstanding - sweet fruits, Belgian yeast, and a slight spiciness. Very inviting. The palate doesn't disappoint in the least ... sweet roasted malts, exotic fruits, and the finest Belgian yeast flavors. Starts out quite sweet, then yields to more complex fruity and spicy notes. Moutfeel is medium, with a very pleasing alcohol warmth. Finish is dry, despite the sweet beginnings. Mildly acidic, yet zero bitterness. Wow, what can I say ... it's Westy 12. You really just don't get any better than this. At the very top of my list, edged out ...maybe ... by St. Bernardus Abt 12. Maybe. Over all, though, one of the top beers in the world. Excellent in every way imaginable. 943 charactersbeerphilosopher, Dec 27, 2006
4.51/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Date on bottle says best before 11/1/09. Poured into a Rochefort chalice.
Poured a really dark amber brown with an off white head that stayed throughout the glass and left some lacing. Smell is a little lighter than I expected, but still plenty of dark fruits and spices, with a little bit of a sour smell detected. Taste was much of the same, didn't really detect any sourness that I found in the nose, also I couldn't detect the alcohol. Even with my expectations of this beer being very complex, it still caught me a bit offguard, it was very nice, nearly perfect. Medium bodied, with a light to medium amount of carbonation; it was smooth with a slightly dry finish to it. Drinkability was incredible, alcohol was not to be found and it seemed to go down just as easy as a 3.2% cask ale, I had to hold myself back from drinking this too fast. The best beer in the world? Maybe. My favorite beer? No, maybe with some age though. A damn fine beer worth seeking out? Absolutely. 982 charactersbadbeer, Dec 27, 2006
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A Christmas present from my daughter who is spending a year near Amsterdam. She made the trek, made the calls for an appointment, took the trains and got a few rides....There is no way that I thought this beer could ever live up to its hype. (A group of us just got back from a vacation to Belgium and we could not get this beer anywhere.)
It lived up to its hype!
A plain brown bottle with only the cap signifying that you have a Westvleteren 12 in your grasp. On the cap in computer print is 22.11.09...it was just a month from being picked up at the brewery. The beer pours into my official "Trappist Westvleteren" tulip glass (also part of the present) a burnt amber with an offwhite head that lasts a good while before disappearing into persistent lace.
The aroma is a delicious combination, perfectly balancing sweet malts and dark fruits. There is raisin, some plum, backed by caramel and light toffee.
The flavor is just amazing. Again, the perfect balance of malt, dark/dried fruits with a hint of alcohol. A little taste of brown sugar, fresh plum, dried cherry, and the slightest hop presence to wrap everything together. The aftertaste stays with you, making you not want to eat or drink anything else to help you savor this beer.
Medium body, velvety smooth, and a nice alcohol warmth.
This beer is close to perfect. It's freshness no doubt really helps the intangibles come out, but I happen to have another couple of bottles that I plan to stash away to try later. The smoothness and balance are so hard for any other beer to capture, and this beer does that impecibly. What a great Christmas present!!
edit: OK...I did find the date and put it in my review. I put the rest of my bottles away to cellar, taking out for special occasions. I hope a few last a year or so. Fresh it's, well, exceptional. 1,822 charactersncbrewerbun, Dec 25, 2006
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Last of the birthday brews. 12/22
Pours out a very nice dark coffee with mabey a 1/2 of finger of offwhite suds. The chunks are in the bottom of this one for sure.
If you want a pure pour you have to be very careful. I might do that on the next one. I want every part of this in my westy chalice.
Smell is like a fine wine. So subtle with fruits and spices galore.
Raspberry and cherry hit me first and the yeast is so impressive.
I smell coffee and sugar and caramel and malt. The yeast is the strongest though as it burns the nose.
Taste is a malty sugarness with hints of cherry and orange that dance on the tip of the tounge. Coffee and grapefruit come to mind.
This is a very sweet beer. The aftertaste is the best part because it lingers such a long time in the back of the throat.
Mouthfeel is perfect with the spices and the alcohol mixing to leave the tounge coated with so many memories.
If I were either a rich man or a monk, I could drink this all day and all night. 987 characterspeabody, Dec 23, 2006
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A deep, rich brown with a shorty frothy off white head. 
As soon as I popped the cap I got a whiff of the aroma. Like letting the genie out of the bottle. Malty raisins and plums, not overwhelming, balanced.
Much stronger flavor than the aroma suggested. The earthy malt flavor penetrates deeply, paving the way for the alcohol follow through. The first sip is definitely a wow moment. There's a lot going on but it's not like flavors are coming at you from every direction, it's the unified whole that creates the flavor experience.
Lingering flavors leave behind an enjoyable alcohol tang and then the malt flavors settle in. 
It's so interesting and complex I find it very drinkable for a high alcohol ale.
Did it live up to the hype? I think so. I wasn't expecting a miracle or an otherworldly experience and what I got was one magnificent drinking experience. For sipping one beer, I don't think it gets any better than this. 935 charactersbgraney, Dec 15, 2006
4.68/5  rDev +1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Purchased a bottle at 't Waagstuk in Antwerp.
Appearance: Pours a hazy, dark ruby-brown. A one-inch, beige head fades to a very persistent, thin layer, leaving thick lace.
Smell: Fairly light overall, but nice. Raisins and other dark fruit, light roastiness, with a light graininess. Alcohol is also evident, but is mild.
Taste: Very nice. Lots of dark fruit like raisins and dates. It's sweet but is balanced well by a peppery and alcoholic bite. The finish has nice bitterness to balance.
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, low carbonation with alcoholic warming in the finish.
Drinkability: Sweet, but very well balanced.
Overall: This is a great beer. It might not be the best in the world, but it certainly is fantastic. 732 charactersEPICAC, Dec 09, 2006
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is one of those beer pilgrimages that you dream about. From Paris, we took four trains to get to Poperinge, Belgium, not knowing if the café across the street from the brewery would be open (it was Sunday). We hitchhiked through hop fields to get to Westvleteren. 
All the beer is poured from bottles, even in Westvleteren, but the quadruppel gets a glass with a gold rim. Nice touch. Wonderfully dark, rich color. Deep malty smell. The taste is enough to make you weep. Its a rollercoaster, really. The hops give you a nice introduction while the malty richness round out the flavor. The first hint of the alcohol is a appley overtone that is complemented perfectly by the hops. Truly spectacular. This is beer that I could drink for the rest of my life. Undoubtedly. 779 charactersjpagewatts, Dec 08, 2006
4.55/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finaly get to try this one. Big thanks to HimmerMan.
Pours a mostly clear burgundy cranberry color. A fluffy eggshell head fades a bit and leaves some sticky lace.
Malty, candi sugar, spice in the nose. Also some fruity notes and quite noticeably a plumb like aroma.
Fruity flavors are abundant banana clove for sure. Plumby, pruny flavors. A nice spice element. Some alcohol. A light hopiness in the midst of everything.
Medium to full bodied. Perfectly carbonated. Perfectly dry. Warming to the palate.
Don't know if this is my # 1, but can certainly see how this is one of the best beers out there. 608 charactersBeerRun13, Dec 08, 2006
4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The bottle came to me in a trade from BA dogfooddog, and was unlabeled, with a yellow cap indicating a best before date of 08 04 08, making this a little over a year old. As I poured into a tulip, the beer came out murky dark brown and had a two finger thick foamy head. The aroma was spicy-sweet, with the smells of fresh hay, ripe cherries, chocolate, brown sugar, and apple skins detectable. The taste was about as smooth as I have had in a beer of this strength. Sweet tropical fruit and spiced bread like malts interplayed with earthy yeast and spicy hops, and everything was in perfect balance. The beer was somehow robust and delicate at the same time. At this young age the alcohol was evident, but only as soothing warmth. The mouthfeel was oily smooth, and the beer went down very easily and left a sweet aftertaste. Very fine beer indeed.
I decided to drink it side by side with a 2006 St. Bernardus Abt 12 for the sake of comparison. The color of the two was almost the same but the St. Bernardus was much more carbonated. It also smelled stronger, and had a distinctly sour note in the taste that was absent from the Westvleteren offering. The Westvleteren was sweeter and smoother than the secular cousin. Bottom line; cant go wrong with either of them. 1,272 charactersrajendra82, Dec 03, 2006

How can the monks be so selfish. 327 characterstjthresh, Dec 02, 2006
4.6/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A two year old bottle poured into a goblet. Very opaque appearance with a chestnut hue. Dark chunks of yeast present. A soda-colored head dissipates quickly. The aroma is that of a caramel apple, with hints of nut, chocolate. Rather earthy/leathery. It is not a strong smell, but enough to let you know something good lurks beneath.
The taste is dominated with malty caramel and nuts with small hints of (?)cabbage. It feels smooth and rather dry on the tongue. Very potent. It finishes as smooth as it starts and is very agreeable. Great beer. 547 characterswagenvolks, Nov 27, 2006
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Westvleteren chalice it forms a whispy tan head that is very creamy as it settles and leaves sporadic lace. Brown body with small amounts of super fine carbonation.
Smell is of dark fruits, namely plumbs, raisins and suggestions of chocolate and caramel in the backdrop. 
Taste: This is where the rubber hits the road and this is where this brew excells to perfection. What I don't pick up in the smell is the hops and spices that make up the finish of this offering. It has everything you'd expect from a quad and then blammmo right towards the finish is a spiced up, alcohol warming, and a touch of hop bitterness that really keeps this huge offering in check and adds to the drinkability as well. 
Notes: I was taken back by the complexity and depth of this offering. You could tell me there is a woody presence and I could find it. You could tell me there are exotic fruits and in the depths of this brew I could get a slice of mango. Its all over the map and perfectly executed. The spices and slight bitter balancer towards the finish was the sealer for me. I bought 4 bottles of this and I will pull one out when the mood hits me although they may stick around for very special occasions. 1,218 charactersDogFood11, Nov 27, 2006

gotta let this one sit out of the fridge for at least 15 minutes before serving....
A: pours a dark brown with a 1 and 1/2 finger off-white head. Down to about a 1/4 inch after about 1 minute.
S: Smells yeasty. Dark fruits....definitely apples and plums.
T: flavors blend so well it's hard to pick out anything individually. I'm not even gonna try, but it's oooh so nice.
M: smooth and chewy at the same time. Is that possible? It appears so..
D: I'd drink them all night if they weren't already designated to friends and trades... trying to rationalize drinking another, but not comming up with anything good. 
I gotta admit, with it being number one, I was expecting a religious experience, instead I ended up with a really, really good beer. My best advice is to NOT drink it cold. You gotta let the flavors show through at about 55 degrees. (20 minutes outside the fridge). 945 characterschadspivey, Nov 26, 2006
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 533cl bottle with a 30.08.09 freshness date
Appearance - Pours a very dark red/brown, with around half an inch of head that clings to the side of the glass with each swirl.
Smell - Dark fruity smell of raisins, plums, and cranberries. Yeasty smell as well.
Taste/Mouthfeel - Very creamy, malty mouthfeel. Taste of belgian candi sugars and dark fruits. Light hop bitterness, and the perfect amount of carbonation. The closest thing to an orgasm of the mouth. Absolutely wonderful.
Drinkability - The 10.2% alcohol is barely even noticeable. Very drinkable brew; my 33cl glass was empty before I knew it, and left me wanting more and more. I could drink this everyday for the rest of my life, if it was readily available.
At first I was hesitant to give this beer straight 5s, but I honestly can't find anything I'd want to change about it. Perfection in a bottle. Easily the best beer I've ever had. 912 charactersdrumline, Nov 19, 2006
4.78/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A 33 cL bottle purchased from BelgianShop.com.
A: The beer is a deep, dark brown color. When held to light, a few red hints emerge, but not enough to radically change the color. The head is a billowy white crown, pouring to 2 fingers and leaving lace throughout the goblet.
S: The beer has a big, bold alefruity aroma. The scents are thick and lucious, with raisins, milk chocolate, figs and yeast dominating the nose.
T: The ale has as many flavors as it does scents. The malty body is thick and chewy, full of candi sugars that are sweet without overloading the tastebuds. The candi sugars are followed by an array of dark fruity flavors: raisins, figs, dates. All of the flavors occur at once and never dominate each other. Truly an incredible beer.
M: The flavors are so intense that they almost overwhelm the senses. Every sip, especially as the ale warmed, was a pure treat.
D: The 10.2% abv is a whopper, as is the thickness of the taste. The abv is gonna limit you to one or two and the thickness is gonna fill you up quick. Absolutely drinkable and well worth the cost. 1,093 charactersakorsak, Nov 09, 2006

Deep brown beer with red highlights, low carbonation. There was a head, for about 60 seconds or so, but it has dissipated to a reddish/purplish/brownish-stained island and a single ring of white lacing around the entire goblet. 
There is a faint nose, but what is detectable is sweet malty beer.
Wow, my first impression is subtle boldness; nothing about this beer is simple or ordinary, yet it remains constrained and civilized. Quite a work of art, indeed. Complex sugar-dominated flavor profile, full of rich, sweet caramelized malts and candi sugar, and yet it remains tame and never overly-sweet; most of the sweetness rolls off after just a brief moment, to reveal a complex, colorful aftertaste. Warmth is the only hint of alcohol. Notable flavors include pepper jack cheese, dried fruits (apricots, dates, figs, bananas), faint hop bitterness, and delicious spring water.
Carbonation is very light and hardly there, and adds a bit of spiciness that enhances the flavor perfectly. It is slightly sticky, which adds a bit of thickness and cuts drinkability a tad; honestly, though, it's the most drinkable quad I've had yet-it's not as thick as maple syrup and also doesn't coat your tongue.
Highly recommended; I was expecting a much more arrogant beer, and what I found was a gentle giant. 1,431 charactersrayjay, Nov 08, 2006

Head dissipated quickly. Poured a dark and murky, like a good Belgian should. Had a bready aroma, with some light malt. Faint fruity esters. A tart flavor with a nice heavy melanoidin background. Little bit of a thin mouthfeel with very little finish. Extremely drinkable for a beer of this abv.
I did a blind taste test between this, Rochefort 10, and St. Bernardus 12 to take some of the bias away that I might normally have for such a rare beer. I had a hard time differentiating it from the St. Bernardus (makes since, because St. Bernardus contract brewed for Westvleteren for many years.)
Great to try, but given its rarity I would go with Rochefort or Chimay first. 725 charactersCH3CH2OH, Oct 29, 2006

pours pale brown with ruby highlights. a thin layer of very fine dense head on top that lingers and pops back up with a gentle swirl.
aroma is awesome. i almost can't find all the right words to describe it, there is so much depth there. dried fruit, like dates or currants more so than raisin. a little alcohol in the end. slightly spicy with a nice earthyness.
taste is spectacular. all the elements of the aroma are here and more. nice malty background. toasted rye bread. currant and dates again. moderate sweetness. a little alcohol warmth. superb balance between all aspects of the beer, mellowed and meshed together to perfection. wow.
mouthfeel is great. out of the bottle it was too cold and came across a bit thin, but letting it sit for a while to warm really brought out its true self. a bit thicker than i thought it would be.
drinkability is great. i could easily drink this with dessert every day if it was available. a truly wonderful beer.
i can't call any category on this beer anything other than exceptional. wonderful beer that i can happily give a solid 5 review.
i almost don't want to remove it from my 'wants' list so that i can have it again, but feel it's more important that anyone who would have potentially hooked me up sends it on to someone who has never tried it. 1,494 charactersgrub, Oct 24, 2006

Smell: Smells of dark, candied, fermented fruits. Raisins come to mind, maybe figs too.
Taste: Sweet at the front, alcoholic fruit in the back. Aftertaste is candied fruits and alcoholic fumes.
Mouthfeel: Velvety feel as the foam touches the lips. Sticky and viscous. Coats my mouth with foam.
Drinkability: As with any quad, drinkable in moderation. I would say because of the lack of carbonation, more drinkable than most. 645 charactersDouggiePhresh, Oct 24, 2006

Chestnut brown in color...some mahogany hue and three full fingers of thick, off-white head. Leaves behind some thick, clingy lace as the foam recedes back into the brew.
Huge raisin profile, vanilla, a hint of sherry and caramel in the nose.
The taste is fantastic...subtle spice is added to the raisin character and a dose of brown sugar as well...the alcohol is very well hidden, although this one warms you within just a few sips. A hint of sweetness is there, but finishes quite dry on the pallet.
Mouthfeel is above average and the carbonation is sublime...not a session beer, but quite mindless to enjoy the hell out of.
Definitely one of the best in the style and one to seek out if your pallet is receptive to the quads. 906 characterswarriorsoul, Oct 23, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A massive thank you to the extremely generous Skyhand for parting with this! You rock!
Pours an almost cocoa color, with edges that are very light brown. Head was a sparse carpet of off white foam. Aroma nearly bursts from the bottle as it's poured. It's syrupy sweet, with notes of vanilla, dried candied plums crusted with sugar, maybe some raisins, and just the absolute barest hint of caramel.
Taste is dark fruit syrup with fleeting wisps of vanilla, and toffee caramel. It's rich and makes you feel almost naughty for drinking and having such impure thoughts about a liquid made by holy men. 
Mouth is really huge, even without a lot of carbonation. I wish I could take this beer for granted ... what I mean is, I wish this beer was so plentiful that I could buy it just about everywhere. I would love to drink this again. 837 charactersTheBungyo, Oct 17, 2006

A: Dark, dark, reddish-brown. Off-white head, not much retention or lace, but it leaves A LOT of lace.
S: Dark raisin, sherry, dark bread, brown sugar, spice, 
T: Dark raisin, rum, dark caramel, brown sugar. Moderate bitterness for the style; relatively dry (yet hints of syrupy sweetness), warming finish. A step up from the St. Bernardus Abt 12 (they're approximately the same colour, but this one tastes darker/maltier). Exceptional.
M: Moderate body & carbonation. Not as attenuated (dry) as expected. Not exceptional, but its definitely got it together.
D: Very good.

3.97/5  rDev -13.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I was fortunate enough to score a bottle of this stuff stateside and sampled it with a friend side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt 12.
The beer poured a rich and slightly hazy brown with a small tan head that quickly turned to lace.
The aroma of the beer was that of dark sugars, raisins, and figs, all carried up to your nose by the volatile 10.2% alcohol. It was nicely estery without going overboard.
The flavor of the beer had a rich maltiness with many accents of dried fruits, such the aforementioned raisins and figs. The hops were there enough to balance things out. The beer was also very creamy and smooth.
The mouthfeel of the beer was medium and not too heavy. The carbonation was fine and tight
Overall, a very impressive beer from a modest monastary.
As complex and impressive as this beer is, I feel it's touted so highly partly due to its scarcity. Having had it along side the Rochefort 10, I actually liked the Rochefort better. To me it seemed to have a little more depth and richness than the Westvleteren. 1,060 charactersSacoDeToro, Oct 05, 2006
4.28/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Well, since this is the most revered beer in the world, I had to give it a shot. 
Pours a cloudy chocolate brown color. A thin head forms at the top, but it's not too thick. For a 10%+ ABV beer, it's what you'd expect. It does however lace the glass as you work your way down.
Smells of sweet malt, dried fruits, alcohol, and cocoa. As it warms, more fruitiness comes out. 
Flavor is where this excels. Lots of depth. At first you get a sweet flavor up-front, followed by little bitterness and yeast, then the sweet fruit comes out. As you swallow there's some chocolate, and the sweet finish.
Mouthfeel's thick at first, but it goes down easy and smooth.
For something over 10%, it's very drinkable. In a lot of ways just because of the flavor depth and how it changes as it warms.
I guess the obvious question is - is it the best on earth? Does it live up to the hype? Personally I like a few other beers more than this one. It's wonderful, but it's not my personal favorite. It's ONE of the best, but definitely not atop my list.
It's possibly the best of it's kind. I think it's different enough from Rochefort and St. Bernardus to suggest everyone try it. They're similar, but not quite the same. Each is good in it's own way...but considering how hard this brew is to come by, I'll likely stick to the other two most of the time.
Edit in 2015: I'll admit that this beer has grown on me quite a bit. At least as much as a beer I've tried a dozen or so times can. The additional hops compared with the other Trappists allows it to shine. It's not my absolute favorite beer or anything, but it's definitely in my top 10. 1,624 charactersDomingo, Aug 26, 2006

Poured a very murky deep browny red colour with some dark coppery tinges - also quite a few floaties... Creamy tan head poured fairly thick and rocky then faded quickly to very light layer... No real carbonation to speak about... some light sticky lacing...
Aroma - Where to start !!! Strong dark, alcohol soaked, fruits (raisins, figs, prunes and blackcurrents were some of ones i could make out), strong toffee maltiness, loads of treacle/honey sweetness, ginger bread, christmas cake spices, some light rum notes, nutmeg, some faint aniseed notes, yeasty/bready, peppery, some light hops coming through the maltiness... outstanding...
Taste  Strong spicy fruits (definite raisins, figs and prunes), strong warming alcohol, roasted malts, molasses and treacle sweetness, malt loaf, quite strong Belgian yeastiness, light aniseed, peppery, some light medicinal notes, spicy / peppery hops cut through the sweetness, ginger spiciness.... again outstanding...
NOTE - Towards the end i poured the last few yeasty dregs from the bottom of the bottle into the glass - this just seemed to concentrate the flavours even more...
Feel - Very smooth and creamy with some light sharpness after a few seconds... full bodied... unbelievably drinkable considering this is at least 10.2%...
Overall - Believe the hype !!! This is without doubt the finest beer i've had the pleasure of sampling so far... Outstanding and highly recommended.... Thankfully i still have 2 bottles tucked away for another day !! 1,635 charactersmdagnew, Aug 23, 2006

Cloudy dark brown with wispy off white/tan head. Nice lacing and more retention than I expected.
Dark fruits and some flowery aspects of the aroma.
Flavor started off a little tart and vinuous. Finished with a somewhat bland caramel that I usually equate with homebrew. Light spiciness and a hint of brown sugar.
This was incredibly smooth and easy drinking. Finished with a small lingering sweetness with some booze burn. This made it drinkable as all get out. 520 charactersDithyramb, Aug 16, 2006

First off, thank you to Phatz for going to great lengths and expense to get this bottle and then showing his true nature by being so kind and generous as to share it with me.
A: This beer sits in the bowels of my snifter a dark caramel-swirled brown coated in a full head of sullen khaki with expertly clingy lace.
S: Wildflowers and alcohol. Spiced plums and earthy scents. Mild yeast.
T: Sweetened prunes and melted caramel start things off. After that the taste becomes so incredibly smooth and complex in a way that defies tacked-down descriptions of individual flavor components. 
I pondered over my share of this beer for some time trying to identify and capture the flavors that make up the taste of this beer. 
Eventually I decided that they are too tightly woven, and mellow, and strong, and muted, and complex to be picked apart and written about as individual elements. Instead, I have decided that this beer must be appreciated and enjoyed in its entirety, and that it does in fact taste like Trappist Westvleteren 12.
M: Very smooth and mild on the tongue. Prickly and tart at first before turning immediately mellow.
D: A strong beer but infinitely quaffable. The combination of flavors and textures in this bottle truly put this beer in league unto itself. If it were more accessible I could drink several of these every day for a long time without tiring of it.
This beer is at peace with itself and the world. There are no internal conflicts or doubts. All the elements and flavors are in harmony working together to bring a sense of quiet stillness and well being to those who consume it. 1,711 charactersfroggyfrog, Aug 12, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5How do you review this beer? How do you rate a beer that many people believe to be the best beer in the world? With all the hype surrounding this beer and all the anticipation, (including the price tag), I had very high expectations. I was almost expecting to be disappointed as this beer has been pedestalled as "the holy grail" of beers. Truth is; it is deservingly in a league of its own. 
Appearance: Pours a deep brown color with a nice beige head that fades into a frothy cap and an attractive halo. It was surprising the head and lacing on a 10.2% ABV beer. 
Smell: The aroma is complex and sweet. Dark fruits like plums, figs and dates are all interwoven into a truly enticing aroma that smells only like Trappist Westvleteren 12 (Yellow Cap)! I was surprised at the amount of floral character this beer displayed.
Taste: The taste can only be described as tasting like Trappist Westvleteren 12 (Yellow Cap)! It is completely unique. There is a tartness surge on the front end, then a very mellow smooth silky vinous middle with caramel flavors that lead into what I might try to liken to figs and dates and toasted brown sugar malts; but it is really so well blended that is hard to isolate individual flavors. In the aftertaste, there is again a yeasty tart that maybe be similar to a splash of green apple, and a bit of alcohol warmth. I love the stinging character on the lips. It is not clear what causes that spicy stinging sensation (maybe the acidity) but it begs you to drink more. Truly though, I can only describe this as being in a league of it's own!
Mouthfeel: Super freaking smooth and so creamy it is sinful! It is light and perfectly carbonated to be full and easy to drink at the same time.
Drinkability: Absolutely dangerous. I was pleased to share this beer with a couple of close friends, but I must say, a beer this big may never go down so easily! Is a $300 case out of the question? If it fits in your budget, absolutely go for it; you won't regret it. It goes down so dangerously easily its indescribable. Until next time someone shares a Westy 12 with me, I will keep a special place in my heart for this spectacular gem.
Hope this is helpful.

4.66/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle Cap reads: 24-05-09
Poured a very dark, reddish brown. After reading many reviews, I was very surprised by the enormous head. The head is a white/tan and it's big, chunky and long lasting. What little dissipation there was yielded to very smooth, silky lacings. This is by far the best looking and most intriguing of the Belgian quads that I've sampled. 
Aroma wasn't as strong as I expected, even after letting the beer reach room temperature. Smells consisted of dark fruit mingling with a light malt presence. The alcohol content and a slight hop aroma are also noticeable. Swirling the bottom of the almost empty glass gave the best scents. Some spice and floral notes made the last few smells a bit more complex. 
The first sip was like drinking velvet. The body and carbonation lend to a very drinkable beer with a very light syrup consistency. There is a notable taste of cherries and plums up front. This is followed by a sweet caramel and nutty flavor. About mid-sip, the high alcohol content becomes very noticeable. The pleasing warmth traverses the palate and can be traced to your stomach. Other notable flavors included clover, light ginger, bittersweet chocolate and an aftertaste that provides gentle hop bitterness. 
This beer personifies what I love about quads. I completely forget that I'm drinking a beer while sipping this fine brew. It feels more like I am enjoying a fine dessert wine and my imagination easily allows me to imagine it being some form of divine nectar. 
I would not consider this to be the best beer that I've ever had. However, I would say that this is the best Belgian quad that I've ever had and one of the smoothest, most balanced and pleasurable brews that I've ever enjoyed. I tried my best to be objective, despite the hype but the mystery and the quality of this beer lend to a very unique and memorable experience. I regret that I only have five more to enjoy! 1,931 charactersEstarrio, Aug 10, 2006

Well...it is...but I don't think I can really adequately describe why or it's attributes. 
Pours a beautiful amber brown with a faint amber head that melts to a ring of lacing that lasts thoughout the drink. 
Aroma is sweet malts...period. 
**edit...one year later...there is nothing simple about the aroma...sweet malts, yes, but dark fruits, candied sugars...more...no words... One year later I am forced to kick up my rating of the Aroma from a 4.5 to a 5.0...it truly is exceptional. 
Taste is sweet candy malt, smooth dark fruits...raisins...prunes....others. 
***edit...one year later...yep...all of the above...still few words and can't add much to what I already wrote. 
Aftertaste is slightly dark fruit sweetness and alcohol warmth. 
I know this is a bad discription of this brew, but the bottom line is this is incredibly smooth, warming, and sweet. 
***edit. 
For my BA Anniversary I received two very fresh bottles of this brew...I just remembered...the orginal review was of a fresh bottle as well. 
This beer really does deserve it's hype...it is extremely complex and obviously very well crafted. I would like to try another St. Berny's 12 for comparison again...another excellent quad...but this one really is worth the hype, if not the price. 1,404 charactersIntriqKen, Aug 06, 2006
4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5My father surprised me, last week, with a package on my doorstep. Low and behold, it contained 2-bottles of Westvleteren. The 8 and 12. A few months ago, at a RAQshow, I was lucky enough enough to have my friend Antonio share his recently ordered Westvleteren 8 with me. One worthy for review, but not in this forum. Regardless, the 8 has been placed in my cellar for drinking in probably in 2-years. This leads me to the Westy 12. I let it reside in it's box, out of sunlight, over the weekend. 3-days later I placed it in the fridge and another 4 to 5-days laters we proceeded to drink it. So here we are...
We cooked a generous portion of mussels seasoned in basil, onions, cream, garlic and white wine. We took the Westy 12 out of the fridge, opened it and let it breathe while we ate our mussels, bread and salad and drank a Victory Grand Gru with dinner. After dinner, we poured the bottle into two Tripel Karmeleit tulip glasses. I have a thing for tulip glasses - I prefer them over all others regardless what might be recommended. 
The beer poured dark brown into the first glass and produced a half-inch head which dissolved quickly. The second pour resulted in no head and finished with with a much darker, murkier result. The lacing on both was little only resulting in tan bubbles sporadically placed on the edge of the glass. The smell resembles a brown with banana highlights and alcohol is easily traceable through the nostril. From sip to sip the taste is very complex and, like the Westy 8, the finish is as smooth as smooth can be and this is what makes Westy the best beer in the world. Its finish cannot be matched. I hope to order more of this beer as I feel, like Corsendonk Christmas Ale, it will taste much better with age. My guess is 2-years min and max. 1,787 charactersmakisupa, Aug 03, 2006
4.77/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Vintage 1997
Poured clear mahogany until the near bottom of bottle arrived, which added murky sediment and a few flakes.
Off-white head was moderate, not large, and receded within two minutes to edging only.
No lacework except for a few erratic dots.
Aromatics lead off with boozy figs, raisins, caramel, chocolate covered apple, and a hint of mandarin underneath.
Rum-soaked dark fruits with a tootsie roll center.
Nose rounds out very warming with vineous notes and vanilla.
On the larger side of medium bodied, slightly syrupy but quite creamy, and a bit sticky. Carbonation on the low side.
Pallet is alcohol-laden with chocolate, caramel, toffee, raisins, and ripe fruits.
Bitterness is perfectly balanced, keeping the residuals in check.
Finishes with a lingering warmth on the throat, with rummy caramel notes and vanilla.
Only the slightest wet paper note is a detraction, and a decent trade-off for some added vineousity.
Kick ass after nine years. 971 charactersbrewandbbq, Aug 02, 2006
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had to order this beer to see what all the hoopla is about. I received 3 bottles 3 days ago. I had one chillin in the fridge. This doesn't seem long enough to let the yeast compact , but I'll drink it anyway. dated 24-05-09 , so it's very fresh.
This poured a hazy dark brown. Creamy head that lasts.
Smell is has some bourbon/alcohol notes. Faint hop aroma.
Taste has some dark fruit , possibly prune or raisin up front. This melds into a nice light hop bitterness and seems to finish with some woodsy bourbon flavors. Couldn't find anything objectionable.
Mouthfeel is surprisingly crisp and light considering the amount of alcohol and flavors.
Drinkability is amazing , very balanced. I could sip a few of these all night.Could I be buying into the hype, I dunno ? I like this beer. 800 charactersRaymond69, Jul 27, 2006
4.89/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5After lurking for many months, this is my first review for BA, because it is practically high treason to drink this beer and *not* review it. Westvleteren 12 is absolutely spectacular, worth the year of uncorroborated hearsay that I've seen here. One owes it to themselves to track this beer down, regardless of what style they prefer. It took me 1.5 years before I had good enough trade fodder for it... thanks so much to Aloha for the hookup.
Pours a surprisingly light amber, like many brunes, with very little head and subtle lacing. Carbonation is perfectly balanced, very subtle and warming.
I could spend a long time picking apart the various flavors of this beer, but it's a lost cause because the flavors continue to show themselves differently after every sip, every minute increase in temperature, every separate bottle in every context that I could possibly drink this in. More importantly than the flavor, one thing I think many reviewers overlook here is that this beer is so animated, it has such a distinctive character and personality - and it's so dynamic that it reveals new sides of itself after every sip. My first sip was different from my second sip, which was different from my third, and on and on for 90 minutes.
The best point of comparison, unsurprisingly, is Bernardus 12 from the tap; but this is richer, far more complex, with a bit more pronounced alcohol at the finish in its warmer stages.
I rarely place a beer on my shortlist until I've had multiple experiences with it, to develop a relationship with it and discover new things after every bottle. I will gladly make an exception for this one, not because of its rarity and hype but because it gave such a positive first impression that to do anything else just feels wrong. If it isn't the best beer in the world, it's certainly in the top five, and I say that with confidence after only one bottle. It sits in a class with my other favorites - Rochefort 10, Westmalle Tripel, Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - of quality, subtlety, and depth that just demolishes every other beer out there.
I want another right now. Writing this review makes me a little sad that I'm presently drinking something besides it. 2,214 charactersnickd84, Jul 24, 2006

4.92/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I will keep my comments brief as there are enough people contributing their opinions on this beer. 
I recently returned from Belgium where I visited the abbey with a friend and consumed/purchased each of the Westvleteren trappist beers (in addition to an old red cap I obtained at De Kulminator in Antwerp). The beer is fantastic, my ratings clearly show I do not diagree with this. However, I find myself hard pressed to declare it the best beer in the world. I think it is hard to claim any beer is the best in the world as temperature variations, storage conditions, age, not to mention quality of that year's ingredients can alter the taste of any beer to make it better or worse. 
As a result, I think it is actually the scarcity of this beer that drives up the desire and thus the eventual payoff. It is not that the beer is the best in the world (though I would rank it in my top 5), it is simply that after so much longing, one cannot alloe oneself the disappointment of not calling it the best in the world. Many of you may think my comments blasphemous but I do not contest the goodness of the beer, I only wish to point out the effect of expectation on perception....
This beer continues to grow on me every time I drink it, or as is more often the case, drink another beer out of my silver-rimmed westvleteren chalice 1,338 charactersBig78CJ, Jul 14, 2006

Pours a deep chocolate brown with a thin layer of foam. Beautiful body, but I was a bit disappointed with the head. damn. But still worth a 4.
Smell is figs and dates. A little sweet. Not much alcohol. Smells clean and crisp. Very nice. Wow, there are a lot of layers to this. Very, very nice.
Incredibly smooth taste. It's hard to believe this is 10% alcohol. Fruity smooth. Plums and raisens. So well balanced. Clean aftertaste. This is everything I hoped it would be. The best I've ever had.
Mouthfeel is ridiculously good. It's creamy beyond belief and the carbonation bubbles are microscopically tiny and tickle the tongue in an entirely new way.
Drinkability is out of this world. 759 charactersDaveFL1976, Jul 12, 2006

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer was every bit as awesome as I was hoping, and thus much better than I was expecting. Very appropriate for my 500th review on BA. Thanks to dogfooddog once again for the trade. This is a 3 year sample, and a much fresher review will be forthcoming.
The beer pours to a nice dark reddish brown. Decent frothy head that doesn't quite stay around for too long, but it laces to the glass fairly well.
The smell is great. Very complex. Sweet and nutty with lots of fruit and berry esters. Nice roasted barley flavor as well. The taste is just as great and equally complex. Very smooth. Mouthwatering bubblegummy, cotton candy sweetness. The sweetness is not cloying, but just right. Has a great roasty nuttiness that pairs brilliantly with the sweetness. The alcohol is no more detectable than it is in the blue cap, which is not at all. Awesome. I can't wait to compare the fresher version to see if this is still the case.
Body is full and creamy. Residual sugars stay in the mouth forever, punishing you with the fact that you probably can't drink another bottle right then and there. Awesome through and through. I can't wait to go to Belgium myself. This beer is every bit deserving of a 5.0 rating. That being said, I think Rochefort 10 is every bit as brilliant as this, much cheaper, and readily available here in Iowa. That simply cannot be beat, number one rated beer or not.

edit: I just had the fresher ~6 month version of this beer tonight (8/24/06). I did the Rochefort vs. Westy challenge, and the Westy prevailed on all fronts. My roommate and I were even biased towards the Rochefort. Had a much cleaner flavor and finish. Not quite as roasty. Lots of bubblegum esters. Phenomenal. I want more. 1,731 charactersneonbrown82, Jul 06, 2006
4.53/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to 1759dallas for the bottle. Best before 15-02-09 according to the crown cap. Served up in a Trappiste Rochefort chalice. Dark ruby-brown color, topped by a lovely off-white head of foam. Rich, malty-caramel aroma laden with ripe, fruity overtones. Big sweet malt flavor bursts out on initial tasting, followed by dark honey esters (with notes of raisin and plum) and enough bitterness to keep it all firmly in check. Finishes with delightful lingering maltiness. Surprisingly light-bodied for the strength.
What I really like about this is how lightly drinkable it is for a 10% trappist... it dances on the tongue in a way that I've not experienced before in an Abbey quadruple. Quite amazing. 705 charactersallengarvin, Jul 06, 2006
4.9/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A careful pour yields a very dark mahogany like intensely dry wine. A tan head, one half inch tall, sits atop. It will never go away. 
Delightful smell. I'm usually not as big fan of Quadruples as I am some other Belgian styles—I prefer Dubbles—as they tend to be overpowering, too alcoholic and astringent. I like to get kicked in the face by a stout or a double IPA, not by a complex and fruity Belgian. This is perfect.
Gingerbread. A pleasant walk down a spice aisle in a store with wooden floors. You smell the products, and the history surrounding the products, not floor cleaners. Everything is beige like a mid October sunset. Dull and sweet, but just as full as life as it ever was.
Very, very creamy. Such a perfect mouthfeel that I notice it even before the flavor. I'm taking too small a sip, like a bird. Conserving. I must forget the price.
A respectable sip reveals a creamy yeastiness that gives way to fruit complexities that are above average (which is saying something, since the style is certainly above average, but it is still not up to snuff with the most complex). Like organic fruit candy, the kind that actually tastes like fruit but only like the good parts of fruit—oranges, apples, pears, and mint. All sundried, mellowed out to perfection. Damn fine. Damn fine.
A great great beer. Not quite the best Belgian I've had, but close enough to where I have no problems at all with this being considered the world's best. Believe the hype. 1,474 charactersmynie, Jun 29, 2006

Appearance - very dark brown, with a long lasting fluffy tan head.
I wouldn't say anything about the aroma and taste that a hundred others haven't already said, so I'll dispense with that, other than to say that it truly is an incredible flavor. But I do want to say how incredibly drinkable this beer is. I was amazed at how little alcohol presence this beer had. It was so smooth and so easy to drink. The alcohol warmed the back of my throat a bit, but that didn't last. 
I tried very hard not to let the status of this beer influence my rating, and I feel as though I've succeeded. I didn't expect the beer to be the best I've ever had, I just expected it to be good, and I wasn't disappointed. I will have to say that at this point, Westvleteren 12 is my favorite beer. I won't go so far as to say it's the best in the world, just my favorite, which makes sense as this style is my current favorite. But that doesn't mean it will always be.
This is a truly exceptional beer, regardless of its status. 1,072 charactersjdoolin, Jun 22, 2006

Appears a deep mahogany color with a beautiful 1/2" beige head that slowly fades out. Scattered lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of candy sugar, raisins, brown sugar, and some black grapes.
Taste is of sweet brown sugar, rich malt, vanilla, raisins, nuts, and dark fruits.
Mouthfeel is lingering with chewy, malty sweetness, lip numbing stickiness, but very much balanced with the malt and hops melding together for a superb finish.
The ABV is well hidden.
I had this next to a 15 year old bottle of Westy 12 and while the older bottle was more complex(and mildly oxidized), the fresher bottle's flavors and mouthfeel outdid the elder bottle.
Edit 11/25/06: I just popped a 3 year old bottle received in a trade from prop13. This one seemed near flawless. I had it side by side with a Rochefort 10 and it slightly edged out the Rochefort by a hair with it's smoothness, gentle hopping, and a boozy brandy-esque enjoyability.

A cloudy obscene looking dirty pond water brown pours from the bottle. Quite beautiful:) Slight off white head with trace lacing.
Big roasty caramel malt, alcohol, toffee bar, orange peel, hints of apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, fig, and spicey etheral aromas.
Roasty, and malty as hell. Fig paste, thick vinous earthy flavors, petroleum, caramel, good carbonation, somewhat loamy, spicey, very balanced and overly complex. Leaves a slight alcohol burn in the chest.
Spicey, carbonated, creamy mouthfeel. But not sure how drinkable it is considering the alcohol.

This beer poured a dark brown color with highlights of red. The foam was creamy and tan, and settled to a thin coat. The smell was lightly malty and slightly vinous. The taste was malty and lightly sweet with a touch of vinous overtones. The flavor was good, but was much less complex than older bottles that I had sampled. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-full body and good carbonation. The aftertaste was pleasantly malty. Slightly warming. This was the first time I had sampled such a "young" bottle of this beer, and frankly the beer tastes much better after aging in the bottle a few years. 755 charactersUncleJimbo, May 29, 2006
4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Once this was poured it had a cloudy mahogany hue to it.
The smells were so complex I had trouble deciding what was all in there. The only prominent smell was fruit filled pastries.
I could taste barley and molasses with an oaky finish. There was so many subtle flavors mixed in I couldnt decipher many of them. Once it warmed the flavors changed.
The mouth feel was syrupy and creamy. The texture was smooth with light carbonation.
I think this beer was a bit too overwhelming for me right now. 
There was so much going on I didnt know what was going on. I especially enjoyed letting it warm and seeing the changes that occurred in the flavor. 
Once my palate is more refined Id love to try this again and see what I can decipher. 743 charactersWonderWoman, May 29, 2006

A: Pours a dark, chunky brown. Definitely some floaties in there. Nice sized head (especially given the fact that I poured into a 6oz Grand Cuvee glass - thanks Nick, both for the glass, and the idea of what to finally use it for). 
S/T: Lot going on here. In my opinion, not the best tasting beer in the world, but certainly one of the most complex. Rasins, plums, dried cherries, big malts, fresh maple syrup, fine scotch, and port. So many different flavors and all there with a big presence. I felt, however, that it was a bit too sweet. The alcohol was also not as masked as other similar beers (like Rochefort).
M/D: Very syrupy feel. Nevertheless, i liked the full-bodiedness. Really felt good on the palate. Drinkability not so great on account of the sweetness and alcohol.
Best beer in the world? Not in my opinion - still a good one, and definitely worh picking some up if you find it. 1,037 charactersLnedrive14, May 24, 2006
4.48/5  rDev -2.8%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4orrshow received a bottle in CanBif from Goldorak, and decided that he had to share it with me. Neither of us know when we will next have the opportunity to taste this one. Date on the cap was 06 04 07.
Poured slowly into a chalice. It is murky brown and no head formed. Kinda looked like muddy water. I'll admit I was hoping for darker, with a creamy head, as I've seen from other Quads.
I could smell it when the glass was a couple feet away as orrshow finished pouring. It has a very sweet smell that is rife with alcohol. A little bit reminiscent of ice cold, fine scotch, port wine and dark rum. Raisins and other dark fruits, baked sweets and candy sugar. With each smell I could likely add another item to the list.
The taste is again big and sweet, full of alcohol. Again reminding me of tasting an ice cold scotch in the overall effect of it. Brown sugar and dark grapes, with many other subtle sweet flavours in the mix. The finish has a fairly hot alcohol burn, and has a touch of molasses.
This beer is rich and sticky in the mouth. The carbonation is there, but it is subtle and natural feeling.
This is very good, but I wonder if the hype and limited availability doesn't effect people's overall impression of the beer. I certainly wanted it to be the best beer I'd ever tasted, but it wasn't there. In a way it felt less like beer and more like a hard liquor drink with how prevelant the alcohol was. Having said all that, I would still like to have this again, and certainly wouldn't let any chance of acquiring it get by me. 1,556 characterselricorico, May 23, 2006
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I got this beer from thomashardy for an AleSmith Barrel Aged Wee Heavy. I have been sitting on it for a few weeks, and now, on my birthday, I think it is the time to try it.
This beer pours a dark rust brown color with a light brown head. The head is quite fluffy. It fades very slowly, leaving many thick laces.
This beer has a spicy peppery aroma. I can detect some alcohol. It also smells of dates and maybe prunes and raisins. It has a rich caramle sweet aroma also. It has an earthy yeast aroma. 
This beer tastes very complex. It is very well balanced. I taste some spicy flavor. Also, the dark fruit flavors are present. Raisins, prunes, dates. It tastes sweet. It has a slight bready yeast flavor. 
This beer is very smooth. It leaves a caramel sweet aftertaste. It is carbonated to perfection.
This beer would probably make an excelent session beer if you could get it. It is a little high in alcohol, but the great well balanced flavor more than makes up for it. 
Is this the best beer in the world? Apparently so. If you want my opinoin, and you must since you are reading this review, it is definately a great beer. I have had other beers of different styles that are equally as good though. It is definately the best Quadrapel I have had though. Thank you thomashardy for helping me finally try this great beer. 1,342 charactersOStrungT, May 23, 2006
4.86/5  rDev +5.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Before I say anything I want to put out a huge thanks to Martin (Goldorak) for this bottle. Very generous of you man. 
Appearance  This beer pours a very cloudy brown color. There is a slight bit of maroon tinge to it as well. The head is virtually non existent besides a ring and a tiny bit of bubbly froth in the center of the beer. 
Smell  I get all those nice dark fruit like dates, plums, and prunes big time. There is a very strong dark spiced rum aroma arising from this beer as well giving it an alcohol scent. Some yeast is detectable along with some brown sugar sweetness and spice. The complex combination of all these things makes this beer absolutely wonderful to sniff at again and again. 
Taste  Up front this beer is extremely strong of sweet malts and that nice dark rum characteristic I smelled. The plums and raisins make themselves present with a caramel and brown sugar sweetness added on. Dark spiced rum flavors linger on strongly after a sip is taken. Its wonderful.
Mouthfeel  Carbonation is very nice here. Nothing to complain about. The feel of this beer is almost silkyit has this nice subtle creaminess that I enjoy quite a bit.
Drinkability  Top Notch. It is so easy to drink despite the high alcohol content and robust flavor. This beer would not have lasted long if I didnt show restraint to enjoy it.
For me it lived up to the hype. I must say this is among the best beers Ive ever had. The only downer is that it did not look amazing which is not that important. 1,532 charactersOrrshow, May 22, 2006
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This bottle dated 30.03.02 - this bottle is 7 years, 2 months old, more or less. I had forgotten I owned this and it is now the oldest Westv. 12 I have tried. This one was brought in by D&V and is probably part of the first batch of westv.12 i tried in early 2002; 2 of these got lost in my local store's (case and keg) large cooler and I acquired this one after more than 3 years of being hidden. I think I have had it over 6 months. Notable it has been refrigerated for probably 4 years.
cap abv says 11%, this has been reduced from even higher levels and today AFAIK is around 10.2%.
Pours 10% head; nose is a gentle glowing sweetness with some sweet raisiny notes, not so much bread-sense yeastiness as the 07.09.04 bottle reveiewed earlier.
Taste is somewhat drier and more subtle up front, with more sweet-type fruity notes and less sense of yeast or bread. There are so many different tastes active in this beer it is very hard to put into words for me. the sweetness slowly becomes bitter and by the finish is bittersweet, dark, and a little heavy. the alcohol is invisible in this bottle. Overall the intensity of taste is less pronounced than the previously reviewed bottle.
It has been over 3 months since I last had ANY westvleteren 12 or 8, but this reaffirms that this truly is a masterpiece of the art of brewing 1,341 charactersdogfooddog, May 17, 2006
4.25/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Deep murky brown with nice 1/2 inch cap that never fully goes away. The swirly top is what I'd expect from a good trappist ale. The smell is nice and complex, but not as strong as it could be. Notes of chocolate, tangy raisin, and alcohol eminate. The taste has similar character of chocolate and raisin, only slightly sweet, and it finishes with an earthy/herbal flavor. It doesn't seem as complex as I would expect from the top rated beer overall. The mouthfeel was the best part of this beer. Rich, creamy, but not that thick, the bubbles are perfect on the palate and it finishes smooth. I enjoyed this beer, although I didn't think it was amazing. I would definitely like to try it again though.... 703 charactersbennetj17, May 15, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Head died quickly. Slight remnant holding on around edge of glass. Lots of sediment..HEAVY with sediment. Toffee colored, raw sienna.
Aroma slightly sour like apple juice. Candi sugar, raisins. Caramel apple.
Oh my god, where to begin. There are far too many flavors happening to even try to isolate one. Bit overwhelming in the best way possible. Maple sweetness hits the tip of the tongue immediately before the caramel apple flavors wash over the palate. Lots of toffee and dried fruits. A slight malty roastedness lingers after the swallow...coffee undertones towards the back of the tongue with a minute sourness in the middle of the tongue. Holy Jeebus.
Thick texture. Its almost like they brewed the beer then removed actual "liquid" out to condense flavor and mouth feel. 
It was everything I thought it would be. With a bigger head this beer is perfect. 874 charactersWestsidethreat, May 15, 2006
4.94/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Super huge thanks to Prufrock for the opportunity to try this one. Poured a third of the bottle to get three fingers of dark tan head over a gorgeous clear red red-brown liquid. Smells musty, yeasty, banana, pineapple, lightly anise and plum, hint of alcohol. Smells a little bit like some indoor public swimming pools. Dried hay, vanilla, flatly of raisins, some brown sugar. Not to the nose, but wafting up from the glass I get belgian candi-sugar.
Tastes, hmmm...chocolate with oodles more flavors and the beer develops into a rich deep wet chocolate like premium cake. Whoa, man, this beer is so damned tasty I'm having a hard time picking out flavors. So many, so rich vibrant, so complex, and well balanced. It's perposterous that something can taste this wonderful. Light fruity esters tamed by darker dry brooding malts. Alcohol sting is clean and mild and comes across as peppery. Phenolic funk is on the stage singing, but is just a voice in the choir. Brown sugar, some candi-sugar, amaretto, nutty. Vanilla keeps the dry finish in check. All this time I've been comtemplating a flavor that I couldn't put my finger on. But now I think I got it. Blueberry raisin bagel from a high quality bakery. Not a bite out of the bagel, but like you've scraped the soft dough out and are sucking on a piece of the toasty crust. Deliciously flavorful with a mild sweet seeping out as the amylases in your mouth break down the bread. Near the end of the glass the dry finish is becoming a bit woody. One more of these beers would likely be enough.
For a long time I've been wanting to review this beer so I could criticise 'the masses' for buying into all the hype. But I must say, this is the most amazing beer I've ever tasted in my life. Perhaps the most enjoyable treat of any sort I've ever tasted in my life. Too bad about the large head, this beer had a perfect score locked up for sure. Md-thick mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Creamy smooth body. I could drink this stuff forever. 1,995 charactersmentor, May 14, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer looked much like a cloudy root beer that picked up some straw towards the edges, but had a mossy green halo around the edges when held to the light. Also, there were a few flecks floating around. The dirty off white head looked a little like my carpet with uneven bubbles creating a pleasantly chaotic surface that didnt last for all that long.
Smelled of salty, flakey pastry that was creamy and doughy. Also included ideas of gooey cookie and/or bread dough with a sweet musky honey. Hell, it could even smell like baklava if you squinted right. Theres also some fruity notes of figs, cherries and plumbs. I was really astonished (as if I wasnt impressed by now) by the residual alcohol suggestion where my mind pointed out where the 10.2% should be, but my nose could only pick up its shadow. Very nice indeed. 
Tasted of creamy, milky caramel then picks up a pleasant tingly sensation that blossoms into an amazing syrup, peaches and pecans. Then there are also some playful light nips of hop that roll around my tongue, back and forth re-releasing little hints of a milky bread dough, honey and nuts in between the suppressive drops of dryness. Finishes like the pastry from the smell with some honey. As I exhale, I get an amplified, brilliant doughy yeast.
The mouth feel is light to medium and creamy with a brilliantly paired sandy feeling carbonation. Perfect!
What can I say? This ones in a class of its own. Thanks to blitheringidiot for this one! 1,493 charactersDarkerTheBetter, May 01, 2006

4.67/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5First of all I must thank meathookjones for this little bottle of what is turning out to be the best Belgian beer I have ever had the pleasure to...
Pours a hazy, dark reddish to brown with 1 inch head that stays for a bit then quickly dissapates. The lace is fine, and sticks to the snifter all the way around. 
Scent is of rich bready malts, sweet candy, dark fruits, grapes and a spicey alcohol. 
Taste is WOW. It is very complex. I don't know where to begin. Ok, a spicey alcohol as it starts with a solid rich malt backbone and yeast after that I get lost. I can taste some of the fruits I smelled in the finish. I get just a bit of citrus at the end as well. Did I say complex? This one is hard to get each flavor as I taste it. However, I have to place this at the top of the Belgian Quads I've had. 
Mouthfeel is silky, velvety smooth. It's not sticky for being such a big beer. It goes down easy for the incredibly complex flavor and the abv. I could put many of these away in a sitting till the alcohol caught up with me (ok maybe two). 
Yes, It lived up to the hype for me. I am amazed at the complexity of the flavors. The scent was fairly easy to distinguish, but the flavor was another story. Truly, a world class beer. 1,248 characterstrumick, Apr 18, 2006

It pours a dark ruby colour with a nice stable head and a lot of flaky yeast. 
Smell of baked bread, malty and some minor oxidation and husky smell. (don't want to anger the Westy fans, but I smell it)
Taste of grapes and currants and dark fruits, is that cherry?, what a nice balance! The maltbitternes changes with each sip. This beer drinks very easy and I have to be carefull not to drink his too fast. Although I feel the warming alcohol, it is very well hidden. 
This is a very good beer, but I think the reputation is part of the high ratings. 712 charactersAbsumaster, Apr 10, 2006

A - Pours a dark brown/red color, lots of carbonation, nice small creamy head which leaves pretty quick, lots of nice lacing throughout the drink in forms of islands in some spots.
S - Scents are very complex, lots of stuff going on, but could detect plums, raisins, toffee.
T - The taste is very very nice, I believe I've had nothing like this so far. Nice tart/tangy/sweet flavor. Could taste plums/grapes I think. The finish is dry and clean.
M - Medium body, well rounded, with a carbonated feel.
D - Very drinkable. This is my first Westy, and what a powerful/excellent/awesome brew. Just might have to try and get some soon. 851 charactersWasatch, Apr 09, 2006
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Well, since I recently visited this Brewery I figure I should review their beer. Having the notion that this is the best beer around and very difficult to get going in, my review could be partial. Pours a rich dark amber/brown with a great creamy head on top. The head never dies and lasts the beer. For such high alcohol content, what make this beer so good is it's drinkability. The alcohol is there but definitely not over powering. It's not syrupy but has good body. All sorts of crazy flavors present..couldn't really begin to define. You just have to try it. 564 charactersharsley, Mar 26, 2006

This beer pours a delicate brown witha slight white head. The only thing that holds this beer down is it's lack of solid lacing. That is it though. 
The smell is extremely complex and layered. It starts off like sweet bread, with yeast tones, gives a bit of raison, English toffee, plums, honey and molassis.
It's like wine, more than anything. 
On taste, words kind of defy you. Incredible malt use, there isn't a hint of the alcohol wallop at all. It's sweet and bubbly like candy, but far from obnoxious. The toffee taste is delicious. all in all, this is the king. THE KING! No chinks in this armor. 733 charactersmurrayswine, Mar 25, 2006

Aroma is nice fruity malt lightly sweet some nice spice underneath. Smells nice and inviting good sweetness not cloying and not much candi sugars at all just good fruity malts. Aroma does fade in intenstiy quite quickly though.
Taste is nice lightly zesty malt good fruit grapes, rasins, dates dipped in nice molasses. Some good lingering spice clove blend with some coriander and a light alcohol flavor that blends well. Taste is great nice sweetness no cloying with candi sugars.
Mouthfeel is good nice big medium carbonation level is real good little zest, but not too much as many from this style seem to favor. Other Quads should take notes and follow suite.
Drinkability is very good also the best Quad I have had to date, didn't want to rate this well because all the crap I hear about it being the best but it is quite good. However not my favorite style so not the best beer in the world for me but can't find anything to nock it for. Big thanks to gimmehead for this great brew he slipped into a trade as a suprise. 1,146 charactersmntlover, Mar 24, 2006

medium brown that shows a ruby amber against the light. golden orange at its thinnest along the edges. an inch of off-white head that falls into lumps and leaves touches of lace.
belgian yeast in the aroma with dark, overripe fruits. a hint of spice, lemon and bananas. a swirl of the glass brings out a hint of the alcohol and some breadiness.
oh dear lord, i understand the hype from the first sip. malty, bready sweetness, the perfect light carbonation, unbelievably rich body with absolutely no hint of the alcohol. ridiculously smooth. a touch dry but with a honey sweetness in the finish. drinkability? i wish it came in bombers, although the alcohol would put me in a coma. i hate being predictable, but this is going to get my highest rating ever. 812 charactersPrufrock, Mar 21, 2006
4.92/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5It's tough to review this beer anymore, almost like knocking it would be trying to unseat a benevolent king. Well, at least I won't be the one to do it.
After biking 5km from Poperinge in cold that felt like daggers, through barren hop farms and fields of sheep, we made it to in de Vrede, that Mecca that had been the final destination of our long voyage. 
Totally worth risking my extremities to frostbite. Just looking at the beer, resting in the wide glass, dark brown with a touch of red, is awesome. 
But the smell simply explodes. You can feel it circulating through your nose and mind, a welcome guest to the body. Dark fruits and nuts and something like cinnamon or licorice all twirl together like those ghosts in The Sorcerer's Apprentice, when Mickey makes the potion. But the nose is deep, much more than any beer I've had, including all the other trappists. Chimay Bleu comes the closest, I think
The taste, though, is incredible. You get the rush of dark fruits and even a few trailing hops to really full it out. But the coolest part is the way it interacts with the alcohol: When you're about to taste the alcohol on the tongue, after the first round has cleared, another round of delicious darkness rolls over the alcohol on the tongue. You expect a bit of a bite from the 10.2ABV, but it never comes, falling to the exceptional depth of this brew.
Go to Westvleteren. In summer, if you can. One of the coolest experiences of my life. 1,467 charactersScheity, Mar 09, 2006

Mahogany under a huge off white head that slowly falls and leaves thick sheeted lace.
The aroma is an incredible mix of fresh bread dough made with cinnamon, raisins, dates and dark cherries with some peppery warmth from the alcohol. Brown sugar from the malts and suggestions of licorice and a sprinkling of powdered chalk. Wow!
Tastes malty upfront then fades into ripe dark fruits such as cherries, plums, and ripe red grapes all dipped in brown sugar. The middle brings a tart flavor followed by some more suggestions holiday fruit cake. Not the cheap fruit cake we all hate to recieve at Christmas but rather like the one made from scratch with a little apple liquer that has that yeasty just pulled from the oven flavor. The alcohol registers only as a pinch of pepper in the finish yet I don't feel any heat upon my breath. Amazing!
The mouth is velvety fullness with just the right amount of carbonation. You bet your ass this is drinkable.
I'm giving this the exact same score I gave to the Gouden Carolus Carolus D'Or - Cuvée Van De Keizer. I think it might be a little better, or maybe that's the hype talking. 1,312 charactersypsifly, Mar 06, 2006

Poured a dark ruby/burgundy red color. Faint tan head. 
Smell and taste were so complex. Mainly evident are the typical dark fruit aromas, plums, prunes, raisins grapes. I also thought there was a slight melony and perfumy aroma as well as woody, musty barnyard characteristics.
Tasted of Port, dark fruit, wine, pears, melon.
Strong alcohol warmth.
Very drinkable. An incredible beer. The most drinkable quadruppel I've ever tasted. Incredibly well balanced and complex.
This beer has a lot of hype and surrounding it and I think it's all very well deserved. An absolutely incredible brewing acheivement! 712 charactersBillyB, Mar 01, 2006
4.92/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I shared 3 bottles with friends after we bought a crate in Belgium, all dated 05/04/08. I didn't see how people considered it all that special, but I was wrong...
It poured into a Westvleteren glass with a lovely dark mahogany/ruby colour with a 1cm frothy light tan head. Mine disippated after a couple of minutes but the other two lasted and lasted. No visible carbonation.
On the first sniff, I was instantly awestruck. A dominant port aroma is the first to come out! Wow! Not overpowering at all, but appetising, totally unique and loaded with fruits and raisins. It's like christmas pudding in a glass, including the flambe. Musty leather yeastiness and woody hops remind me this is definitely a beer.
Loads of other flavours come out when tasting. Raisins, prunes, cherries, wines, port, woddiness, honey, spices all come through, going down in a full bodied beer, with a hint of saltiness and a moderate bitterness at the end. There's a touch of mineralised feel to it. It sounds sweet but it balances beautifully with the other sensations so it's not overwhelming at all.
I've had all the non-Westy BA top 10 Belgians before, and this one is truly a style in itself. There is no comparison to it. And no, it's quite different to St Bernardus Abt (EDIT - Some St B Abt tastes like Westy 12, see my review on it).
Make a pilgramage to Belgium if you have to - Westvleteren is one of a kind, straight from heaven. 1,433 charactersbhb, Feb 24, 2006

Drinking this one was such a thrill and I largely agree with the hype. This is undoubtedly one of the top ten beers I have ever tasted. It is so wonderfully warming and gets richer and more pleasurable with each taste. Well worth a trip to Belgium in my book even if you can get it black market style at the punk bar down the street.

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Presentation: This is the absolute best Trappist beer I've tried out of the six brewed in Belgium. 33cl brown bottle fresh from Saint-Sixtus Abbey in Westvleteren, Belgium. Freshness code has 13/08/08 on the yellow bottle cap and no label; 10.2% ABV. 
Appearance: Smooth creamy off-white head with very tiny lacey bubbles which settles to a thin layer after warming. Color is Dark brown
Smell: Very aromatic. Fantastic malt aroma, along with different kinds of sweet fruit. 
Taste: The flavor hits as soon as it enters the mouth. The velvety carmel complex flavor with little to medium carbonation is something savor. All these flavors throughout tasting are just incredible. Its amazing how this beer keeps its complexity and taste throughout the duration of tasting even as the beer warms. 
Notes: I usually just read the ratings and don't post reviews. However, I felt I had to submit something for this beer; but I must say of all the beers I have tried so far, nothing has compared. 991 charactersygtbsm94, Jan 30, 2006

Deep mahogany pour with burgundy highlights and a thin but dense beige head that settles into a lasting veil which laces nicely for a strong beer.
Aroma is a heady medley of caramelized malts, honey drenched pears, cherry preserves, prunes, soft floral notes, wild berries, grape must, spicey yeast, and a nice blanket of funky Belgian damp cellar notes. Fantastic! 
Flavor goes beyond the nose with complex caramel and candied malt notes, a basket full of over-ripe fruit including plum, dark cherries, pear, rotting concord grapes, and even hints of banana. There's soft mustyness and traces of minerality shadowed by intense yeast and phenolic warmpth. Finish is fruity and balanced by floral and peppery hops. Believe the hype.
Body reaches towards large w/out getting there. The silky smooth texture and creamy body just glides the subtle nuances across your palate. Awesome. 945 charactersAlexJ, Jan 20, 2006

5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Presentation: 12oz. bottle. No label, yellow cap. Date printed is 21.06.08. 10.2% ABV. I had bought this one at In de Vrede in Westvleteren, so it is quite fresh.
Appearance: Deep brown amber with a small yet fluffy light tan head. The beer was pretty clear, but I was careful to reserve most of the yeast in the bottle.
Smell: Rich sweet caramel malt with a ton of fruity esters. A lot of dark fruits, cherries, and prunes. Absolutely wonderful.
Taste: There is a lot of upfront sweetness. The alcohol is strong, but it compliments the beer. Light medicinal phenols and estery alcohol with more fruits, and a very faint bitterness plays on the back of the tongue. There is a light coffee and toffee finish.
Notes: I hate to do it, but this beer is just so good. The complexity and the amazing balance of this beer is just awe inspiring. I think that is what makes this beer so great the balance. Its full bodied, but not thick, sweet, but not cloying, phenolic, but not overpowering, estery, but not over the top, with the perfect amount of bitterness to contrast the sweetness. Absolutely wonderful. 1,113 charactersdauss, Jan 14, 2006
4.74/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I received 2 bottles from my brother and his girlfriend on Christmas eve. Thanks Joe & Lori!
Served in my Orval chalice.
Poured a dark redish brown. Very little head, although a fair amount of carbonation was present. Many fine bubbles coated the surface after the pour, however I wouldn't call it a head. 
It smelled of mulled apple cider with a hint of bread and yeast. Very striking smell to say the least. Also the slightest hint of caramel.
The taste was fruity upfront. Apple cider, caramel and honey. I was suprised that the finish began with more hop bitterness than I expected, as well as a hint of the warming alcohol within.
Mouthfeel was smooth and velvety. Almost chewy. This example had a good amount of carbonation bite as well.
Drinkability was very good. Although the abv is quite high, I found that it went down very easy. The alcohol in the finish did not deter me one bit. My only regret is that I drank it too fast.
All in all quite an experience. I live in an area where St. Bernardus abt 12 is readily available, and I'd heard they were simular. I have to say I don't find that to be accurate at all. Westy 12 had all the things I love about Belgian Quads and a bit of hoppiness to boot. A welcome suprise. 
A true standout in the world of beer. I wonder when I'll drink my next bottle? 1,333 charactersIeatlambfries, Jan 05, 2006
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 411.2 oz. bottle. The cap states 11% abv as opposed to the 10.2% listed here.
Appearance: After removing the crusty and rusty yellow cap, this beer poured a deep amber with blood-red highlights. I was trying not to get any sediment into the glass, but when it started coming out, it came out fast. Therefore, there was a decent amount of yeast floating around in the beer. Where it settled on the bottom, thick streams of bubbles rose up to from patches on the surface of the liquid. The initial head only reached about one finger in the wide-mouthed chalice and settled down rather quickly. A few freckles of lace were left behind.
Smell: Thick with caramel malt, raisins, and molassess. Apples and grapes provided a strong dose of fruitiness. It was a little spicy, too, reminding me of apple pie on occasion. Yeast and some round alcohol hovered in the background. There were light cherries and bread present at times.
Mouthfeel: Medium- to full-bodied with a thick, mouth-filling feel to it. Chewy and light coating. A light, velvety carbonation developed in the back of the mouth. Very nice.
Taste: A big combination of flavors that developed early and continued on well into the aftertaste. This one really lingered. Bread, raisins, molassess, and sweet caramel provided a thick bottom end. I could taste the caramel malt when I licked my lips after each drink. Cherry liqueur and white wine provided a bit of a kick. A little bit of cocoa lingered on the finish, along with the flavor of over-cooked muffins (like when with bottoms get a little too brown). The alcohol was definitely present, but it didn't overpower. No cloying sweetness either, just a nicely balanced beer. The flavor itself might not merit a 5, but the richness, complexity, and the way the different flavors lost and gained ground as the temperature of the beer changeed warranted it. 
This was a hard beer to open. Graciously gifted to me by Bruiser81 a long time ago, it's the only bottle that I have ever layed eyes on, let alone possess. Does it live up to all the hype? Almost. Is it freakin' delicious? Hell yeah, it is! 2,118 charactersQuaffer, Jan 03, 2006

this beer is from 27.04.02
A- This beer pours a deep warm dark brown with lots of little suspended bits. The head is a thin web of bubbles around the rim. 
S- The smell of sweet dark cherries, caramel malt and a faint sour cherry in the finish. Note of oak and vanilla come through aswell. This is a wonderful complex aroma with lots of depth. 
T- The taste of dark caramel malt with some notes of lighter grain mixed. The taste of oak and vanilla come through in the finish with some slight sweetness in the finish but very faint. The notes of brown sugar and cherries are faint in the front of the taste along with some raisins. 
M- The mouthfeel is very light and there is no alcohol warmth or astringency to this beer. 
D- This is a very nice beer. The notes of malt and sugar are balanced with a nice oaky flavor and some cherry characteristics come through but it is not a sweet or hot beer. This has done well with age and I hope to review it fresh one day. 1,002 charactersrhoadsrage, Dec 31, 2005
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer has been aged for about 2 years. The look of this beer pours a delicious dark ruby brown that leaves a quickly disappating tan head. Very little carbonation compared to the fresher one I had 2 years ago. The smell is of candied fruit, plum, peaches, golden raisins, bananas, cloves, and some slight essence of chocolate liqour. The complexity of this beer is the best I've ever come across. The taste of this beer just explodes with the sweet fruit and at first has a powerful vinos essences that subsides with warmth. 
This beer is one that should mellow even more with age but I actually prefered the fresher bottle I had about 2 years ago. As I let this beer warm up I began to taste even more of the honey and clove. Overall this is a great beer, I love things about the fresher version but I love the smoothness of this aged bottle. 850 charactersFranchise, Dec 06, 2005
4.14/5  rDev -10.2%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5HUGE THANKS TO DAVE AT THE PUBLIK HOUSE BROOKLINE for pulling this out of the basement and hooking me up with a huge surprise. Especially since it has been aged for 2 years. Once my heart restarted I poured this bad boy into a Westvleteren glass (also provided by Dave) and noticed that all the carbonation was gone. This was a bit of a disappointment because I remember in a fresher version I had the carbonation caused the yeast to swirl and swim around when the glass is sitting still. It was visually stunning and added to this beers mystique. The aged beer still had a fresh and balanced smell, a bit more molasses / maple syrup then I remember. The taste follows a trend I have noticed with aged Belgian darks, the flavors seem to meld and result in an overall flavor timeline similar to raisin bran. The front is sweet like a dried raisin, the middle is where the molasses and maple syrup are present, then when the hops appear they transform the flavor to a hearty, malty, grainy flavor (the bran part). Meanwhile the alcohol is hidden well, it's there if you look for it, and overall the beer is very well balanced. I have noticed that with age the flavors have toned down and blended much better (as expected). Especially the alcohol, in my previous review I mentioned that the alcohol flavor was too strong that it overpowered the rest of the beer. I rated the 8 over the 12 because of the alcohol flavor balance. So it was a pleasant surprise to see that age has solved this issue. Mouthfeel has also changed due to the lack of carbonation. I recall the fresh version evaporated on the tongue, it was epervescent, and lively. The aged version is more syrup like and smooth, which allows you to roll the beer around the tongue and really study the flavors before it evaporates. That being said, I like the fresh version better. It's more of a party in your mouth. And the drinkability I have to give a high mark because it was very smooth and balanced. The real test was that I was with a newbie to "good beer" and she probably drank more of it than I did. 2,067 charactersdanadeny, Nov 11, 2005
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cap dated 29-04-06: I had intended to not drink this until I found another, but that may be awhile. Besides, this is my 100th beer reviewed.
 Into the requisite tulip it goes, with some effort needed to coax a slight foam, I wouldn't even call it head. When held to a light source, the body is a beautiful cherry amber, clear save for a small number of floaties. The nose is a luscious blend of dark, dried fruits, and some wood.
 The taste is completely blended, there are no layers of individual flavors. The initial flavor is kind of sweet up front, but quickly begins to dry out. The woody, or perhaps leathery, character appears, and then a faint bitterness, as if from hops. The mouthfeel is barely carbonated, but silky smooth, and heavy. I drank three of these the last night of Marvin's rule over Chalkies. It is to him that I owe many thanks for this bottle.
 I think that in Europe, the second number of the date represents the year, rather than the third, as in America. And I seem to remember reading in one of the forums that Westvleteran 12 is bottled three years before the date on the cap. As good as this was, I would like to try a slightly fresher sample. And my two cents is that this is head and shoulders above all other Quads, Trappists definitely included. 1,289 charactersSephiroth, Nov 11, 2005
4.64/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle dated August 2005. Made a pilgrimage all the way to Westvleteren to pick this up. Pours into my Westy goblet black with dark tan hints when held up to the light. Decent compact light tan head which recedes fairly quickly to a thin covering. Aroma is complex and amazing dark fruit, toffee, oak (almost wine barrel), subtle spice from the alcohol. Taste is full on - all of the components identified in the aroma, but so intense. Very sweet start is balanced we superbly by the bitterness of finish and the peppery spice from the otherwise well hidden alcohol. Mouth feel is full and velvety smooth, just about perfect. I can't imagine having too many of these in a session - it would have to be the night cap, however it is almost sad to get to the bottom of the glass, so I have rated it high on that basis. Damn, only one left now :-(. 844 charactershefevice, Oct 28, 2005
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz brown bottle with yellow cap and "import" label. Poured into a Duvel tulip.
Appearance: Deep, rich brown. Smallish off-white head with tiny compact bubbles. Beautiful lace rings as the glass is emptied. Lazy, but steady, carbonation.
Aroma: Complex aromatics. Raisins, figs, licorice, honey, citrus, bread. Sweet and spicy at the same time. Slight alcoholic tinge.
Taste: Rich. Complex. Sweet maltiness blends with earthy yeast and spicy alcohol in a swirling tornado of velvety goodness. Slightly dry, spicy finish. 
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and oh-so-smooth, this is a stunner!
Drinkability: Dangerously so at 10+%. More please.
This has been a "goal" beer for me for a long time. When a good friend saw a bottle, he picked it up for me. What a great friend! 
I enjoyed this beer so much, that I will, without doubt, order it whenever it appears on a beer menu that passes in front of me... 921 charactersresirob, Oct 19, 2005

"trappist westvleteren" on top with their logo in the center. the number 12 is on the bottom of the cap encircled. abv is displayed at 10.2%. there is a best by date stamped across the cap: 14.03.08.
appearance: pours a muddy brown with brick red highlights in a chalice glass. head is a half inch off-white that dropped to a capper surprisingly fairly quickly. carbonation appears to be good, but retention and lacing is just decent. 
smell: smells caramelly sweet with dark fruit and alcohol. medicinal but there are also hints of lemon rind and licorice.
taste: lots of flavors hitting you at once. cloves, caramel, raisins, spice cake, and alcohol. alcohol is prevelant and provides a nice warming effect. phenolic towards the end of the sip with a light yeasty bitterness. vinous with some anise towards the finish and continues in the aftertaste. 
mouthfeel: very nice. creamy medium body with great carbonation despite a slightly disappointing head. rolls around nicely and the alcohol prickles your tongue. swallow is velvet. 
drinkability: i'm not sure what exactly keeps me drinking this, but i have a hard time putting it down. i try to slow and sip and savor, but it's tough. alcohol is there and intoxicating, but this is an easy to drink quad.
overall: delicious. this is deserving of the current number one beer in the world. i cannot give it a five, nor can i make it my highest rated beer, but it's definitely one of the best beers i've ever tasted. i have three more of these put away, and i can't wait to see how it matures. 1,708 charactersPx2GrafX, Oct 17, 2005

Pouring into tulip at a chilled temp (recommended on bottle), it pours a thick brown w/ a 3 cm tannish spongy head that is very dense! 
Sipping, I get lots of sweet brown malts along with a slightly sweet peach flavor- some alcohol drying on the finish w/ a bold malty after-taste. During drinking, i fell in love with the flavor so much that I had difficulty reviewing how complex and yummy I found it. I just know it tasted EFFIN' GOOD!
If there's a perfect balanced beer, this is it! Full-body, carbonation wasn't too bold or tingly allowing more flavor to come out, while the smooth body takes over along with a very slight dry finish. WOW!
Drinkable? Does a bear shit in the woods?! By far maybe the best beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking! 885 charactersFish113d, Oct 10, 2005
3.71/5  rDev -19.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to numenor1 for the chance to try this one. Pours a beautiful amber deep copper color into my DFH chalace. At first, an impressive head that looked like a cooking pancake, with large bubbles rising to the surface. Then, the head vanishes. I pick up alchol and dates in the aroma. Interesting enough... but not shocking. Taste is that of rum mixed with ripe fruits, and then it dries out and leaves your palate clean. Almost too dry though to me. Mouthfeel is good, outside of the dry chalky taste that this leaves. It is drinkable given the ABV, but I've got to say, I don't think this is the "best beer in the world". 629 charactersdeejaydan, Sep 27, 2005
4.55/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle Inspection: Cap has a date, but I can only read the first two numbers: 11/08/? Cap is worn on one side and the bottle has the "American" label.
Aroma: Rich malt nose, hints of fruit, mainly fig, and a good dose of spicy alcohol.
Appearance: Clear tan amber glass with a good cover of off white head that lasted as a collar (impressive given the abv), but didnt lace. Last pour was murky with a fair amount of blackish sludge (you KNOW I drank it all). 
Flavor: Belgian yeast and dark fruit are the main flavors with a touch of almond liquor (Frangelico). There is a hint of the "fresh Christmas present" taste that I get from Rochefort 10 as well. A well put together taste overall and enjoyable.
Mouthfeel: Lighter than expected but silky smooth texture
Overall Impression: Impossible to be objective with this one. In some ways I was a touch disappointed. I imaged angels dancing on my tongue and some sort of beer epiphany that would allow me some sort of deep beer insight into the nature of things. 
Its just a beer. A good beer, heck, a Great Beer! But, beer. 
That said, it is massively drinkable and if the monks lived next door, Id drink this daily! Im not going to fly all the way to Belgium just to drink this though. If you get the chance, by all means, give it a shot, but if you dont get the chance, dont feel like youve missed out of what beer is about.
Undying thanks to the premier sack kicker on BA: Stonecrusher for the bottle. Look, I finally drank it! It only took me a year! 1,525 charactersHardTarget, Sep 25, 2005
3.93/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Red-orange or copper color, with a thin head composed of very small bubbles. Beautiful fine resilient lacing. The lacing lasts and glitters in the light. It's gorgeous. 
Nose is malty and yeasty with maybe some subdued raspberry -- I know this may sound like blasphemy but it reminded me immediatly of New Belgium Frambozen.
Taste is burnt roasty and smoky with a bite of carbonation. Raisins definitely; here I think of the Raison d'Etre. Sweet malts. As it warms there is more heady alcoholic sweetness. Burnt chocolate, caramelized sugar like creme brulee. There is a lot of yeastiness, very fruity. 
The body is medium-full with an incredibly soft and smooth mouthfeel. The finish is like silk. Drinkability is hurt a little by the richness and the alcohol which I can feel. 781 characterstexashammer, Sep 19, 2005

Thanks so much for the opportunity to try this highly prized brew. No label, no fancy silk-screened etching. Just a plain, brown bottle with the famous yellow cap of this widely sought after beer.
Simply tremendous flavor. So rich and complex..alcohol is subdued to a point that you can hardly notice it. So many others have described it's multitude of characteristics in near perfection, so I'll spare you the details. Truly exceptional mouthfeel..silky smooth and delicious. As drinkable as any beer. This really leaves you wanting more..it's a good thing this stuff isn't widely available, because I'd be happy but poor. But then again, if you're buying Westy 12, you're probably not too concerned about the price. This is the quintessential treat for any beer lover, and something every BA should (and would probably love to) try.
Amazingly, it somehow lives up to the hype. Best beer in the world? I'm not sure, but it is certainly deserving of the title. 1,022 charactershero27, Sep 18, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Yeah buddy! I got me some Westy in a trade, and now that it's harder to find than all hell, i'm gonna drink it and review it. Blank bottle (no label), brought back directly from Belgium. Yellow cap is dated 05/04/08. Poured out to a dark brown color that became bright auburn red when held to the light. Lower carbonation, with some notes of lace in the glass. Nice 1/4 inch head was consistant through the entire glass. Aromas of fruits, buttery malts. Very sweet smelling overall. The taste, hands down, is a 5. I find this beer to be everything it is touted to be; flavors of sweet bread, smooth malts, ripe fruits and roasted elements all perfectly balanced made this brew exceptionally enjoyable. A thick, silky mouthfeel was ever present, reminding me that this brew really is quite heavenly (that's probably what the monks had in mind). Finished crisp, with some bitterness and sweetness in the aftertaste. The nearly 11%ABV was well concealed, a point that is well noted, as this could be very powerful in doses of more than one bottle (but really, who could honestly afford or even want to drink more than one bottle a sitting). A world class brew, and even better now that it is becoming a rarity. Highly recommended. Special thanks go out to kevinl6 for the hook up of this brew and his highly professional and friendly trade. 1,337 charactersFrozensoul327, Sep 14, 2005
4.78/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Consumed in a duel, side by side, against St. Bernardus 12.
What an epic battle it was!
Poured into identical goblets they looked virtually identical and both beautiful... rich tan head, almost completely opaque against the light; deep ruby color where not opaque.
Smells were very, very similar. The St. Bernardus had a brighter smell while this had a deeper one. Same deal with the flavor profile... bright versus deep. An alcohol soaked dark fruit medley going on with plenty of caramelized sweetness. There was also a pepperyness in the finish of the mouthfeel and flavor... perhaps some vanilla, chocolate and coffee singing backup.
Easy to see why this gets the credit that it does. If I *had* to pick which one I enjoyed more overall it would be Trappist Westvleteren 12. A smooth operator with a great deal of depth. The St. Bernardus had a livelyness and a brightness that this did not, which I could see making it more appealing from time to time, but good ol' Westy 12 won out in the end.
When I get the money, I'm going to Belgium for some Belgian brew. 1,070 charactersommegangpbr, Sep 08, 2005
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had this with St. Bernardus 12 to compare properly. They look very, very similar... identical, really. A dark brown with red tints, a good tan head that lingers. Couldn't tell the difference between the two.
Smells is raisiny and chocolatey with a sweet maltyness in there and a breadyness near the end. Light but complex- each layer is separate and precise, but they all come together very nicely. 
Taste is amazing- raisins at the forefront, but there's caramel, vanilla, chocolate and coffee in there too. A good amount of brown sugar adds to the sweetness without putting it over the edge. There's a butteryness in here- in the mouthfeel and in the flavor, making it extremely smooth- and almost dessert-like. Dessert "fosters" style comes to mind- caramelized fruit and brown sugar. And there is a decidedly peppery flavor and feel at the very end- adds this great level of spicyness to the whole thing, wrapping up the flavor nicely.
Mouthfeel is, as I said, very smooth and buttery, also bubbley, chewy, and full- I believe I felt it was "lip-smacking, teeth-licking good." Highly drinkable for such a strong beer (which, by the way, I couldn't really taste, but certainly felt as I warmed up.) Deep and complex, tasty, and becomes even sweeter and more lovely as it warms up.
I really enjoyed both beers- but I prefer this. The flavors seem to harmonize much better, it's deeper, richer. If only this was easier to find... 1,442 charactersscooter231, Sep 06, 2005
4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance is murky brown with some sediment at the bottom. Surprisingly long lasting lacing which made me happy! I'm not getting a whole lot from the smell at first, but this bottle was served a bit too cold at the Hop Leaf in Chicago. As it warms, the smell opens up, but is not as powerful as I would like. It smells very spicy and a little alcoholic - in a mellow, rum-like way. There are also some fruity tones, which take the form of apple and cherries mainly. The taste is like no other beer I have tasted. The best way I can describe it is to tell you to imagine the monks mashed up some apple pie and some pumpkin pie into a liquid and added some Captain Morgan spiced rum. That's all I need to say about that. The mouthfeel is very luxurious and silky, and this beer is thick! This really complements the dessert like flavor well. Overall, I'm very impressed, and I like this one better than the 8. I definitely couldn't drink this every day because of the sheer sinfulness of it all (sorry monks), but I couldn't get enough of it when I had it so I would rate the drinkability extremely high. 1,103 charactersPatYoda, Sep 06, 2005
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sampled from a bottle that's been aged ~2 years. Murky reddish brown with a moderate head of very fine bubbles. Extraordinary delicate lacing in the chalice (it actually looks just like lace) that didn't budge even when the beer was agitated. Superb retention as well -- I don't think the head dissipated at all from beginning to end. Nice aroma, lots of fruity wine/vinous character along with a bit of more acidic fruit, possibly cranberry. Soft maltiness with a bit of light roast and faint hops. Mild fruit flavour throughout, malt sweetness fills out the middle and end, but stays fairly subdued. Some chocolate and roasted malt creeps in, but this is very mild. Caramel and toffee appear at the mid-point briefly. Moderate bitterness with a bit of grassiness. Complex flavour that stays balanced and round all the the way through, but keeps changing. Soft carbonation with an airy texture. Off-dry finish, a full body, and slight alcohol warmth. This is a wonderfully balanced, yet complex brew. A rare treat. A big thanks to Ralph for sharing this truly exceptional beer. It didn't disappoint! 1,100 charactersDrJay, Sep 02, 2005

This was the one that did it for me. I didn't even like beer all that much, I was a college kid used to macro crap and the occassional SNPA. Then I went to Belgium for a spring break trip . Then I ended up at a little bar in Brugges one afternoon that I only wish I remembered the name of. Asked the barkeep to bring me the best thing they had, and sure enough, he did...and I haven't had anything better since. Believe me, I've tried. 543 charactersDanny2321, Sep 01, 2005
4.8/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Reviewed in a side-by-side with St. Bernardus 12.
There's one inch of dense, light tan head in the chalice. A toffee-brown pour fills out a deep red-brown beer (very nice, dark red). The nose is bursting with ripe fruit, deep toffee caramel, tons of malt, some tart apples. Rich caramel and ripe fruit (plums?) up front. Middle is buttery, rich, THICK caramel; brown sugar and milk at temperature. Delicious. Alcohol evident in the bready, yeasty finish. Cookie spice. This is delicious, fruity, buttery, toffee goodness. Definitely the best quad I've had: not too sweet, alcohol well-balanced. Exceptional. 610 characterskbub6f, Aug 31, 2005
4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: I drank this from a Westvelteren chalice, poured out of 11.2 oz bottle. The bottle was prepared for export, with a label. Ordered at a bar in Chicago for $12. 
Appearance: I poured the beer myself, and probably was too tender (there wasn't very much head on top). The color was deep orange-brown, not completely opaque. There was only the thinnest hint of a lacy head, mostly present on the glass when I took sips.
Smell: The smell was very good. I'd been looking forward to this for a long time, so I don't want to allow hero-worship or anticipation to color the review too much... Kind of a bready yeasty malt aroma, pretty strong, with a hint of fruitiness.
Taste: Perfect score. I expected a St. Bernardus 12 flavor based on previous reviews, and the first sip was similar in my opinion. I think it was served a little cold, so I let it sit a while. When it warmed, I could taste more fruity esters than in St. Bernardus 12. Actually this is a lot sweeter, but not as sickly sweet as Rochefort 10.
Notes: I don't really know if it's worth the price on a regular basis, but it's definitely worth it for special occasions. My very amateur first-time impression of this beer: 90% St Bernardus ABT 12 + 10% Rochefort 8 or 10.. 1,252 charactersTurdFurgison, Aug 27, 2005

Pours a deep ruby shade of brown with a nice head that dissipates before too long. Smells of sweet malts, dark fruits, spices with slight mint and clove. It begins to flesh out as it warms. The taste is phenomenal. it's incredibly full and seems to put every taste receptor and area of the tongue on overload. Mouth tingling. At first it's all spice and sweet dark fruits. Raisins, plums, black cherries, some slight earth and rum. Then there's a nice gentle hop twang and then the spice really gets going and completely overwhelms me in the finish. Blackpepper, clove, coriander and faint mint. A bit phenolic. As I swallow my mouth begins to water and tingle all over.  The taste lingers in my mouth and nasal passages. Truly remarkable. The body is medium and the carbonation too, but it coats the mouth beautifully and conceals the alcohol like a master thief.
Fantastic. 951 charactersnumenor1, Aug 27, 2005

A: dark brown body, with creamy with head, you could see carbonation rising up along the edges of the glass. it had a rusty brown color to it, not so dark that it didn't let the light pass through. 
S: This is where it at, all sorts of spicy notes, cloves, corriander, nutmeg, fenel, also sweet fruits like pear, plums, prunes, really nice, and a touch of phenals. 
T: Up front you taste all the nice spicy and fruity notes, this is followed by nice rich oily malt characteristics definatly dark malts here, along with just a touch of noble hop flavors, 
M: very nice carbonation, that runs along the top of your mouth and tingles your asaphogus. this followed by a good oily feeling from the malt, then it finishes with a slight warmth from the alcohal that is present in the back of your throut and gums, also when you exhale you get that I've had to many liquid ice mints feeling in your nose. but it's a plesent feeling reminding you that your drinking beer that is extermely well made.
D: What can you say it's a great beer, and you could probably drink several if you had the money to. 
ps if you see this beer on a shelf buy it right away it is extremely rare. 1,335 charactersbrewbacca, Aug 24, 2005

Smell is very vinous, aged wine/port, fruity, some chocolate cranberries, little bit of alcohol. Taste is insanely complex, its a shape shifter of a brew. First very vinous and port like, chocolate toffee middle, dark cherries, tart bitter finish. The mouthfeel is amazing, silky and smooth, absolutely no rough edges, the carbonation was perfect, this beer just glides. Aged a couple of years, thanks a ton to the man who made this possible. 599 charactersViggo, Aug 23, 2005

Too bad the monks now limit purchases to a sixtus of this wonderful brew. 10.2%? I have had 6% or 8% brews where they failed to conceal the alcohol better than this beer. Much lighter on the tongue than I expected. Not lots of heavy sugars like other quads, but just amazing malts that are light (and crisp, dare I say?). Nose is full of nice yeasties and the hops are surprisingly potent throughout this beer. The Belgian sugars are sweet but not filling or so rich as to overwhelm the palate. Nursing my way through this goblet. May plan a trip to Belgium just to get some more of this beer. 649 charactersMuddyFeet, Aug 22, 2005
4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The INFAMOUS Westvleteren Abt 12. Nuff said.
We all know the awesome reputation surrounding this beer. Is it deserved? 
In this brewer's opinion, most definitely YES. What an awesome creation of mankind and nature.
My sample poured a deep burgundy color - almost brown - as I gently decanted into a goblet. Rather murky, but not opaque. Head dissipated rather quickly, and was not as mousselike as many other trappist ales.
Aroma was of complex esters and fruit. Definitely does not smell like beer at all. Some type of wicked fermented breakfast smoothie for a medieval monk.
Taste? Can't adequately describe it. A nectar - very sweet. A little tartness from the yeast. Complex spice and a slight hop aftertaste. Wow.
A mouthfeel of liquid velvet. Like one of those Elvis paintings. Not too thin, not too viscous. What a great gift from Belgium.
Drinkable? At 10.2%, I can't think of a more drinkable potion on earth. Believe the hype. 957 charactersSixpoint, Aug 13, 2005
4.68/5  rDev +1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5To any reader of this website, it is nigh impossible to approach this beer with any objectivity. As a perennial top-ranked beer, you either want to jump on board and sing its praise or find fault and bring this giant down to a more mortal level. Regrettably, the latter is extremely difficult to do.
Pours a deep opaque brown with a thick tan head so solid you could walk across it. Aroma is malt, candy sugar and some traces of fruit and alcohol. If any flaw exists, I would place it with the nose -- it just never develops as strongly as I would like. I wouldn't call it one-dimensional but not quite as complex as it should be.
Initial taste is warm, smooth and slightly fruity. Dark but not heavy malts, more candy sugars, traces of yeast. Some woody flavors, as if it had been barrel aged. Sweet but not cloying, maybe some plum, cherries, a faint taste of alcohol. Early taste of alcohol puts me off just a little but any reservation is gone before half the glass is emptied.
Flavors begin to bloom as it warms in the tulip. More fruits, more yeast, fewer malts, less sugary. Raisins, currants, almost sliding towards a dark lambic character. A gentile spiciness is found, reminicient of a winter warmer with traces of maple syrup, rum and allspice. A softness persists throughout, making this one very easy to drink. The ABV is hardly noticeable by the end of the glass.
No date, but bottle consumed fresh without aging. Time would only benefit this beer, it can wait longer than I can. Whatever your preference, pour in the yeast -- I downed at the last without regret. 1,589 charactersassurbanipaul, Aug 01, 2005
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The result of a wonderful trade with GClarkage... poured into the accompanying St. Bernardus chalice. A lovely brown, slightly hazy ale with a one finger head that eventually settled to a one-eighth inch layer of foam that never went away. Lots of lace on the glass.
Lots of anticipation for this one... had to work hard to make a personal goal before I rewarded myself with this one. So I was ready and eager.
The aroma was of sweet plums, raisins, dates, and other dark fruits, dark malt, and a hint of brown sugar. Many layered and complex. 
Taste... heaven in a glass. I wanted to compare this to St. Bernardus Abt 12, but the two beers are so distinctive I couldn't. It was a thing unto itself. Dark malt, a hint of spiciness, chocolate, caramel, and a blast of alcohol at the end that was not overpowering and not out of place. Wow.
Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Not like your average drinkin' brewski. Wonderful and sliky.
Drinkability was excellent... I could do several and not get tired of them (although I might not be able to see straight at the end).
I tried to find fault with this beer, I really did... it was almost like a challenge, rating the #1 beer in the world. But I couldn't. 1,219 charactersconnecticutpoet, Jul 30, 2005

Well it tastes just like St. Bernardus 12 and for about 4x the $. Still a terriffic brew. The taste has a raisiny-chocolate, fruity tone. The appearance is a non transparent dark brown with clouds of yeast swirling all around. The aroma is a pleseant bittersweet choclate and plum fragarance. The alcohol is hidden in the flavor but shows by the end of the session. A full bodied brew that is just enough for one session. A treat for anyone lucky enough to find it. 525 charactersphishgator, Jul 12, 2005

I poured this gem into a tulip glass and it produced a wonderful off white head with tight carbonation. It is deep reddish brown and cloudy with yeast particles floating around. The head drops down to about a 1/4" from a 1 1/2". A small head remains through the rest of the beer and leaves a little bit of lacing.
The first smell is of strong Belgian yeast and dark fermented fruits. Plums and cherries seem to accent the sweet smell coming from this anticipated beer. Alcohol also seems to be in the aroma.
My first taste of the beer is complex and hard to describe: Dark malts, chocolate, espresso, and a grainy cherry. Also an unexpected dry grassy, bitterness at the end. The alcohol is very well hidden in this fabled beer. This is a very creamy tasting beer
The mouthfeel is nice and full. It coats your tongue like a fine wine. This is a very creamy tasting beer. Also the carbonation is wonderful. The drinkability of this beer is excellent for something with such a high abv. I hate to say this, but I like the Westvleteren 8 a little better than the 12. That said, this is truly one of the best beers in the world. 1,182 charactersddarden, Jul 10, 2005

A: Cracking open this bottle was like a mini-religious experience. I had had the bottle standing upright in my fridge for a bit to chill it some and to let the yeast settle to the bottom, didn't work. Carefully pouring this beer, I was rewarded with a beer that is a dark umber brownish color. Head was moderate, maybe an inch if lucky. Very dark brown color, seems to absorb the light and let through only a scattering of photons. I noticed some heavy sediment floating in the body of the beer like some lovely zero-G yeastbeasties, suspended and apparantly quite happy with where they are.
S: Dark purple wine, the smell takes me back to communion, recieving the Blood. Faint hints of sweet caramels and sugar coated nuts. Strong alcohol smells give a heady experience
T: Initial taste is a thick layer of flavors that show themselves, then give way to the next, layered is the best way I can describe it. Sweet grape/raisin flavors, then a strong malty sweetness. Next I tasted a peppery spicy zing. There's also a faint alcohol hotness that works well, it keeps this beer from being too sweet, but isn't strong enough to detract from the flavors. Everything here plays it's part to perfection. Superb balance.
M: Moderate body. Low feel of carbonation. The feel of the alcohol is very well masked, doesn't feel anything like 10.2%
D&N: This beer is everything it's cracked up to be and more. Much more. The wait I had to endure (over a year) while aging this was worth it, and I confirm it with each heavenly sip of this marvelous elilxir. I have never in my short beer drinking life had an experience like this. 1,644 charactersJackTheRipper, Jun 24, 2005
4.59/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Hand carried back from Belgium by yours truly.
Pours a deep chestnut, which quickly becomes a muddy brown as the inevitably suspended yeast flows through the glass. It's okay. I want my yeast.
Smell is particularly iconic -- and the best smells are. There are only a few beers that I can think of that have a particular, immediately identifiable aroma -- Cantillon Gueuze, Oerbier and maybe a few others -- and this joins their ranks. The combination of deep, bottomless malt and yeast is intoxicating even before the first sip is taken.
Taste expands the aroma's promise, as honeyed figs, dates, melted carob, and candied, stewed fruit peels swim in a ocean of pure, uncomplicated sweet malt. An excellent attention to balance, to smoothness, to unity of form. Very nice.
Mouthfeel is very good, if juuust a touch lower than I'd like. This was near to still, and I just wanted a little prick on the tongue so that I know that everything's still jumping around here.
Drinkability was very good, as imbibing the bottle was no problem. That being said, there is something called "too much of a good thing" in my mind, and so I felt the glass was more than enough for one evening.
All in all, the world is becoming a small place. This brew is no longer as hard to get as it once was, and prices have fallen, so the mystique may have faded a bit -- but this is still a beautiful brew, and I thank the Trappist brothers for their efforts. 1,451 charactersithacabaron, Jun 22, 2005

App: Beatiful Chesnut brown with thick white head with some lacing.

Presented in a labeless bottle with of course, the yellow cap. I decided to go with the yeast. Contained a little more than I normally like, no much to speak of in terms of a head- I am not complaining. Dark caramel color with heather hues.
Smelled wonderful, bananas and of course that unmistakable Trappist aroma.
Something about this beer puts it heads above even the other Trappist type beers. Like nothing I've tasted before. Fruity, balanced, hoppy, refreshing, amazing!!!

Smell: Sweet caramel with fruit tones. The fruits seem like cherries, strawberries and even banana. Crisp and malty wtih distinct candy-like sweetness.
Taste: Very rich and sweet. Vinous is probably the best overall descriptor. Clean maltiness with a dry and sandy finish. Well hidden 10% ABV. Dry grass, apple, berries, tannins, and a refreshing carbonation. Some light caramel notes linger delicously. This beer is absolutely delicious. No offensive flavors but very well rounded and tasty. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to thick bodied with a great feel on the palate. Not sticky but nice and dry at the end. The dryness seems to amplofy the aftertaste a bit. Well done.
Drinkability & notes: There is no question that this is an excellent beer and very drinkable. This is the second time I've drank and review this beer and I must say I enjoyed it much more this time. The flavor is much more appealing and tasty to me this time around. This was definately worth a re-review 1,144 charactersBrewMaster, Jun 09, 2005

Aroma is very estery and vinous with a port like alcohol character, sweet ripe fruits and some yeasty nutty banana notes. Smells wonderful.

Lots of "hot" alcohol, especially in the finish, along with a lingering green apple tartness. Mouthfeel is medium full with lots of carbonation. 
 I think this beer needs to take a nap and cool off for some time. The alcohol profile is way too hot , and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of the sweetness that I expected. I'll let it sit for a year or so and try again. 719 charactersgimmehead, Jun 05, 2005

Nice ruby to dark brown, with slight off-white head. Head retention very long, lasting. Leaves a thick lace in the goblet style glass. Domination of malt, with various degrees of raisin, chocalot, caramel, and toffee flavoring. Thee aroma of fruit, spice, caramel and plums almost bready, hinting to a wonderful ambrosial nose. Finishing with a pleasant acidity, helping the alcohol grab your palate and making it beg for more, yes please more. The lingering aftertaste sooths the churn for the pleasantness to never relieve your palate. With the flavoring, lasting aroma, pleasant finish making this beer one for the all day marathon of pleasure. Alas the alcohol could cut it short if not carefull. Although the cap date reading 26.11.05 forgive thyne ignorance knowing not how to interpret the date. Beer exceptional yes. 885 charactersamatuerbeerguy, Jun 03, 2005

I wasn't really sure what to expect from this brew, the hype is so gigantic it was difficult to not let that affect my judgements, but after a bit of contemplation, it wasn't too difficult.
Pours a murky ruby tinged brown with a very thick and frothy head that head excellent retention. (I got some on my nose! "It's how we do it in Belgium" afterall) Nose is incredibly complex. Very malty, an almost brown sugar like sweetness accompanied by an overt amount of fruit notes, plums, apricots, cherries, figs and other that are much more difficult to pick out. First sip was pretty amazing, very silky smooth and utterly balanced, only a slight bit of bitterness that played well against the malty sweetness. There is just plain a lot going on here, tartness, sweetness, bitterness and all well balanced. This beer is certainly a true masterpiece. Honestly though, it's not so much better than similar beers that I wasn't entirely as blown away as I half expected to be, it is certainly deserving of the praise it gets, but not so overtly so. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and buttery, but again, not overly so; quite perfect. Alcohol was nearly non-existant, beautiful. Drinkability was excellent, I had no problem drinking the whole lot and ended up wanting a bit more to boot.
Overall I enjoyed this quite a bit and I'll squirrel away my remaining bottle for a special treat someday in the future. This is certainly a gem worthy of note and well worth a try.

A decanted pour reveals a crystal clear rich mahogany brown with a dense head which lingers a bit and then settles down to a fine layer atop the beer.
Aroma is magnificent- I could be happy just smelling this all night. A combination of rich maltiness, dark caramel, dried fruits and roasty cocoa all add up to one singular presence, as these characteristics play off of each other quite sympathetically. Just underneath is a bready/yeasty quality. At 10.8% (per the cap) the alcohol is bound to show itself but it is faint and you really have to search it out.
Dark caramel maltiness dominates the palate, with a not so insignificant clean bitterness coming in second. A distant third and fourth are the alcohol and fruity/bready notes. It is quite nice, but just can't match that magnificent nose.
Helluva beer- no question. I am reviewing such an old sample to let other consumers know that they may indeed be trustworthy- I have had at least four with this date stamp recently and they have all been remarkable. If I should ever have an opportunity to sample a fresher bottle I will not hesitate to re-review. 1,153 charactersTongoRad, May 06, 2005
4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I've had a few of these put away, so today (MAY DAY!) I finally popped one. Pours a deep dark ruby black, with only a table of head that did leave lace on the glass after each sip. Smells like a spicy plum candy, some cinnamon sprinkled prunes, yet without a heavy sweetness. Taste is so velvety smooth, complex combination of dark fruits, slight sucrose, and peppery spices. Is this a big beer? While there is the faint hint of alcohol, this beer is amazingly quaffable. This is the beer to convert your faux-wine-loving friends to come back to barley. Mouthfeel is medium full with just enough carbonation to keep it from being a sweet old ale or barleywine. 
Surprisingly, this beer is not overpoweringly "Belgian" meaning that it lacks that dominating Belgian yeast smell and flavor. They're there to be sure, but it takes a back seat to everything else going on. There are only a few beers that deserve such high praise. These beers could easily become an addiction. Luckily, this one costs about US$8.29 for a 330ml bottle. So, unless I start selling off the wife's basket collection, I'll keep this beer to about one a month. 1,135 characterspentathlete, May 02, 2005

Next has more carbonation but a similar candied taste. End taste is just as sweet, like a sugar drink trickling down your throat. Not a hint of alcohol in the entire thing--remarkable.

Trappest Wesvleteren 12.
What can I say? I was seeking this beer ever since I first started reading reviews on this site. I figured, search for the best... then drink the rest. I was hoping that my taste buds would over time mature enough to taste this beer. Well, I don't know if the tastebuds are mature enough, but I just could not wait any longer.
Placed it in my fridge and when it was cold enough I took it and poured it into a goblet. Poured a dark ruby - brown, with a finger foam head that lingered slightly. The beer smelt sweet but nothing note worthy. Took a sip... Dark coffee taste hits immediately. But once again nothing note worthy. So I then let it sit. 
GOOD MOVE. Once the beer started warming up, you could smell the aroma of sweet fruits and chocolate.
Also, I found that as the beer warmed, the more viscous it became. When cold, it was watery, but as it warmed it became more syryp like. Liquid butter. The taste was much different as well. It became much fruity with hints of chocolate and coffee. The finish was a slow alcohol burn that soothed the throat. 
AHHH the smell I just can't get over the smell. I'm sniffing the damn bottle. 
I find this to be the best beer I've ever had. PERIOD. Rochefort 10 is a good alternative if you cannot find this beer. Worth the money I paid for it. I still got one bottle. So tempted to drink.. MY PRECIOUS. 1,410 charactersBeerNutta, Apr 17, 2005

First you have the high alcohol, sweet honey, maple like a trappist or abbey ale, then you have the lasting alcohol burn of a barley wine, then you have the crisp clean thirst quenching finish that makes it thoroughly satisfying and wanting more. Silky, rich with a panoply of flavors that linger on your palate. Even with a piece of pungent English stilton, westy 10 compliments it well and cuts right through it.

4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From a fresh bottle brought from Belgium. Believe the hype... it's real! And please don't drink this right out of the fridge, it needs to come to around 55F to really shine.
A densely creamy tan head rests lazily atop a hazy, dark russett body (carefully poured from a longstanding bottle it's a clear ruby with orange highlights - but add the yeast later on!). Eventually the head receeds, but it's somehow able to hold a thin but completely solid cap throughout the entire beer. And initially, it leaves solid walls of thin lace that fade to become sheets of tiny spots towards the end of the chalice. And that's no easy feat given its 10.2% abv! The nose offers honeyish, nutty, cocoaish (Ovaltine...?), bready, and caramel drenched malt as well as a bit of hard candy and some chewy fruit (raisins, berries). It's velvety smooth across the palate with a full, dextrinous body and exceptionally fine, natural carbonation. The flavor is even more exquisite than the nose implies, and includes notes of soft anise, lemon rind, a touch of leather, some delicate bubblegum, and a mild floral character that really helps to round it out. They yeast is incredibly important as well, as it gives it depth and rounds it out; and it should be poured even with an aged bottle. Finally, one of the things that makes the Westy 12 such a stunning beer is that it's so soft and supple considering it's such a behemoth. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and when it does appear in the flavor it only helps by lending a "spicy" character. And despite the amount of character it has, it's actually not as malty as a doppelbock. It's lighter, and it finishes semi-dry with more spiciness and yeastiness than sweet malt that might build on the palate... giving it a really great drinkability. Impressive, to say the least, this is a brilliant beer because it's big enough to deliver a great richness and lots of complexity, but also incredibly well-balanced enough that it really leaves you wanting more! 1,991 charactersNeroFiddled, Apr 10, 2005

Aroma was almost wine-like, with dark fruits and a strong breadiness, very good, but still not the best I have smelt. Taste is amazingly all over the map, sweet dark fruits first, malty middle, long hoppy finish, very, very complex, every sip was slightly different. Velvetty smooth mouthfeel, without a hint of alcohol. This beer is exceptional and definitely world-class, but I had one better than it so far. Next stop, the Dark Lord... 636 characterstatterdash, Mar 20, 2005

Both involve the fact that it is hard to get and has a great reputation. Nothing can live up to the legend. At the same time, you want to like this beer because you went through such a hard time to get it.
Poured into a tulip glass with a nice head. Went down into a nice lace that stayed throughout. Dark, but not black as night dark.
Smell is wonderful. You can smell the Belgian yeast esters in a very wonderful way. Hints of candi sugar as well?
Taste is nice and smooth. Belgian yeast esters blend in a way which makes for a smooth, but not overpowering taste. Bananas and cloves seem are present in the taste. I think I'm tasting residual candi sugar as well.
Nice carbonation levels with a good mouthfeel.
Update: Got my hands on a better handled version. Dear me. Wonderful taste. Plums and chocolate.
Exceptionally drinkable for a 10.2%. 937 charactersGeoffFromSJ, Feb 20, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I've waited a long time for this legend. The weekend of the EBF seemed as good a time as any to finally crack it open, to parallel the enjoyment my roommates were likely having hundreds of miles away in Boston.
It poured a dark, chocolatey brown with a coke fizz-colored head. Innumerable small puffs of sediment were suspended throughout, adding to the murky mystery as the head quickly backed into a stiff, 1/2 finger ring of bubbly lace clinging to the glass.
The aroma is rich, deep, and a touch phenolic, with a soft, malty sweetness peppered by anise and other spices and alcoholic warmth surrounding it all.
One taste and its easy to see why this beer is considered the best of BA. The flavors are big, warm, and smooth, softly melding the high alcohol content into a tremendous malt profile full of myriad flavors. Figs, cloves, rum-soaked raisins, anise, and caramel intertwine with a bready, sweet roll-like backbone, leaving the tongue with an almost milk chocolate-like texture sensation.
Bubbles flutter and bite throughout this beer, adding texture to the perfect, velvet-smooth feel of this brew on the palate.
It's hard to believe that a beer is this good. Despite my high expectations, this has been everything I expected and more, worth every penny of its high purchase price.
So complex. So smooth. So delicious. 1,349 charactersRockyTopHeel, Jan 30, 2005
4.32/5  rDev -6.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Recently returned to the states after spending 5 glorious years living in Europe. Visited all 6 of the Trappist breweries while there and Westvleteren was definitely the best.
The monastery is not open to the public except to purchase beer. The day we visited even that was closed so we visited the Cafe De Vrede across the street. Tried all three beers with some of the breweries cheese but the 12 stood out. It's definitely the best beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking.
It pours a deep rich copper brown with a light brown head. The aroma was beyond description. Deserves a higher rating than just a 5.0. Caramel, plum, raisins and possibly vanilla combined to mask the high alcohol content. Definitley the most drinkable high alcohol beer I've tasted. Had I not had a 3 hour drive ahead of me I would have been there all day.
To make this beer lovers dream complete, I had an ice cream sundae topped with a beer sauce made from the 12. Beer and ice cream may not sound tempting to everyone but it was unbelievable! I will never forget this experience and will definitely return to St. Sixtus.
After 10 more years of beer experience under my belt, I thought it only proper to edit my review as I was definitely in awe of the moment when I first reviewed this. 
Picked this up from the Abbey back in 2010.  It's been resting in my cellar ever since.  Bottle cap date of 22.09.13.  Murky mahogany brown pour with a quickly fading one finger head with virtually no lacing.  Molasses and dark fruit, specifically raisins, dominate the nose.  Hints of toffee, brown sugar, and subtle cocoa.  The taste follows suit with dark fruits dominating along with hints of vanilla, brown bread, cocoa, toffee, Port wine, and cloves.  The mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy with light carbonation, subtle sweetness, and huge drinkability considering the ABV.  Overall, while this is definitely a world class beer, I was obviously overrating it on my initial review considering I gave it all 5's.  This new review is much more objective. 2,028 charactersbeerdrifter, Jan 16, 2005

Although it was a few days ago, I still can't get this one out of my head. The beer poured a beautiful dark brown color with a 2 finger head that barely falls at all. The lace is almost solid around the top of the chalice as I drank the beer down. The nose was very fruity, with lots of sweet fig tones, and an almost appley, crisp aroma. There is a nice spiceyness as it warms as well. The flavor is awesome. Very mellow, wtih a spiceyness and an alcohol burst that play very well together. The flavor moves into the fig, and slightly bready notes, but also with a touch bitter on the finish. The feel was smooth, slightly creamy and moderate to thick. Just a nice beer. I didn't want to put the glass down with this beer. This is definately a world class beer. Thanks to SheepNutz for trading this to me before I knew what a treat it was. What a show of advocacy. 923 characterskmpitz2, Jan 08, 2005

Deep rootbeery brown, with a ton of teensy little khaki bubbled carbination. Beautiful swirling going on up top, nice! You can see a lot of carbination rising up past the yeasty chunks. Scents of dark fruits, alcohol, sherry, buttery sugar and kraft's caramel cubes. Tastes of coconut macaroon, cherries and dark fruits. The Blithering one said that he tastes vanilla ice cream, yep. Much sweeter than the others, yet not cloying, just caramelly and warm sherry. Very good mouthfeel. The carbination rolls all over your mouth, froths up just a bit. Smooth and flowing. Wonderful. 
Each of the Westys we had became progressively better to me, and this is definately my favorite over the 6 and 8. This one is damn nice. 900 charactersshapudding, Jan 02, 2005

Mostly malty and sweet, however there is the most intriguing floweriness in the finish, like a blossom. Appley esters come into play a lot and work well to hide the alcohol.

Tastes so complex and smooth, and fruity, and malty, and sweet, and hoppy, and bready, and so, so much more. This is a beer words cannot describe.

4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this first about a year or so ago when I was really starting to get into craft beers. I decided to wait a while though before I tried it again as it had so much going on I couldnt appreciate it all. Bottle is dated with 07-09-04, so I will have to pick up a few to age. This poured out a murky brown with a tall light tan head that filled the goblet. There were some floaties that could be seen occasionally and the beer coated the glass in rings of lace. The head managed to stay afloat till the end, which was impressive. Aroma is very fruity with raisins and other dark fruit. It was quite sweet and spicy as well with a touch of yeast. The taste starts of with a strong fruity sweetness before a good bit of spice comes through to even things out a bit. Earthiness is also in full swing here adding a touch of bitterness before the spicy sweet after taste. Wow there is just so much going on here I feel like I am still missing out on plenty. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with good carbonation. This bottle went down easily but I would be reluctant to grab another right after, not sure why but one was plenty. Amazing beer that everyone should get a chance to try. 1,177 charactersmeathookjones, Nov 15, 2004
4.81/5  rDev +4.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5600th review...
The beer poured into the chalice clear deep amber brown and then the sediment decided to crash the party and ended up with a cloudy and chunky mess. The head was very, very low, but what little was there was persistend and tried to lace the glass. Alcohol most likely impaired the head retention.
The aroma was deep, deep, deep dark caramel maltiness with a huge biscuit and aromatic presence. The fruits present were dark and were raisins and prunes. Some alcohol presence enhance the deeply malty and deep dark fruits that comprised the aroma. The alcohol gave the aroma a vinous complexity.
The flavor was deep dark caramelized maltiness with dark fruits or raisin and prune. The beer contained a slight spiciness that was endhanced by alcohol flavors and fruty esters. The biscuit and aromatic aromas carried over into the flavor and enhanced the complexity along with the malty, fruity and spicy flavors.
The finish was malty with dark caramel, biscuit and dark fruits lasting long into the aftertaste and alcohol warming adding to the complexity but never detracting. The body was full, slick, and viscous with carbonation only impaired by the alcohol content of the beer.
33 cl bottle. Date code of 30.03.02 on cap. No price on bottle, but seem to recall $8 as being the price. None of the Westy beers poured very clean. The sediment separated no matter how carefully the beer was decanted. With the higher alcohol in this beer you could not drink a ton, but the smooth viscous nature of the flavors and the deep maltiness make you want to try. 1,582 charactersGCBrewingCo, Nov 05, 2004

Poured a rich Mahogany colour with an nice fluffy offwhite head. Smell is or dried fruits, prunes, spice and a brown sugar. Flavour was huge. Well rounded caramel flavours combined with liqour soaked dried fruits. A bit of dark sweet bread in the middle i think. Exceptionally well balanced. Carbonation was good and the alcohol was well hidden. Drinkability.... would I have another of course. This was a very tasty brew. Was it the best of the best. Not in my opinion, but then again tasting is subjective and can vary with time and place. A top-notch beer to say the least, but not the holy grail to me 673 charactersTinusTime, Nov 04, 2004
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Well...it's Oct. 21st and it's my birthday today so I decided to have this much anticipated brew...the Westy 12. It pours out of the bottle a deep brown color with a fluffly 1 inch head that seems to produce instant lacing. Yummy. The smell is a mix of candied fruit, raisins, alcohol tones, spiced plums. It has a very vinous, almost red wine aroma. Quite complex.
The long awaited first sip is a smooth earthy malty ride. Raisins, fresh baked bread and dark candied fruits are the first things I notice. It has a pleasant caramel sweetness that's not overpowering. Alcohol is non-existant in the flavor and each sip makes we want to take another sip. The velvety texture is freakin amazing...this is an exceptionally well balanced delicacy.
Mouthfeel is good, really spot on. Carbonation and body are well balanced and make for a lucious drinking experience. A little more body wouldn't hurt though. Drinkability...well damn...I could drink this all night..problem is I'd be drinking it on the street because my home would be repossesed. If this was a bit more affordable it would be a 5 for drinkability. If you have yet to try this gem, track it down ASAP...it's worth the hunt. 1,188 charactersorbitalr0x, Oct 22, 2004

Aroma: Holy hell! I can smell this thing from across the room! Upon closer inspection its smells like a fine red wine. Flowery with some spicy, fruity notes and some alcohol and malt with a hint of caramel. Quite enjoyable.
Taste: Smooth brandy, ripe fruit, raisin, wine, a little hops with a sweet balance of malt and hops. Alcohol plays a perfect role in the taste. Aftertaste is a lingering somewhat bitter taste. This beer's taste is the basis on which to judge other beers of the style. Absolutely wonderful.
Mouthfeel: Absolutely perfect. medium body with a moderate-low carbonation. Wonderfully coating. Flawless.
Drinkability: Well obviously its 10.8% ABV; its not a session brew. This was a great beer to sip because it was just so damn smooth. You don't know how much alcohol is in it until after a few minutes.
Notes: How lucky am I that the wine cellar in my city carries this beer that almost no one knows about? I really could drink this forever. Too bad its so expensive. Ah well. It was worth the 12 bucks. A wonderful and godly brew, not to mention my favorite as of now. no wonder its rated number 1.
Edit: I got the chance to try both the Rochefort 10 and the St. Bernardus 12 and I think that the St. Bernardus was good, but a tad watery and I will have to try the Rochefort and Westvleteren again, because the Rochefort was so good. 1,487 charactersetaggie09, Oct 09, 2004

The nose is somewhat restrained, but it contains sugar, oranges, banana, and croissants.
The palate is smooth with an abundance of flavor. I get toffee, brown sugar, banana, nutmeg, chocolate, quinine and fresh grapes.
The finish is long. The bitterness, reminiscent of quinine or campari, becomes slightly more prominent as the sip of beer fades. It does not, however, overexpress itself.
This beer has extraordinary balance and complexity. It does not hit you over the head; it just states itself perfectly with nothing out of place. I equate it with Veuve Cliquot La Grande Dame. 703 charactersfingolfin72, Sep 23, 2004

Just getting the smell of all the fruit and hops makes me dream away! Drinking it you go to (beer)heaven and afterwards you just feel in a green field with beautifull hopflowers of Poperinge. Well that's not too far from Westvleteren so I mostly go for another one because there is no other beer that you want after a 12 then another 12! 550 characterspaterlodie, Sep 22, 2004

The liquid calms the palate for a moment, stalling, only to move from one archetype to another. The first is coffee liqueur : sweet, yet sharpened with deep etchings of gas. The second is a fantasy realm : baked banana forests dripping with Valrhona chocolate; heirloom oak chests; earth; roasted and raw nut medleys; enlightenment humanity. Sweetness is the life of every layer in this liquid while being shaped with Darwinian structure. Butter-basted tangerine slices drizzled with Turkish honey. Indian perfumes. African coffee. 
One can perhaps see why these European lowlanders thought so much blood was worth expending to maintain tropical spice island and plantation colonies in another era. Flavors like these are as cheap today as $12 or so a third liter. 920 charactersputnam, Sep 19, 2004

Murky reddish-brown in hue, the liquid looks a bit like apple cider fresh from the orchard. The head reached one finger in height on a soft pour. It was off-white in color. Head retention was fair; it subsided hastily to a big, bubbly collar, soapy in the middle. In my goblet there isnt much glamour to this beverage. Is this a sign of high expectations? Id say no. Really there isnt much excitement in the appearance. Ill also add there was not much subsequent lacing, just some unorganized spottiness. The nose on Westy 8 failed to arouse me. I took a sniff of Westy 12 and there are more aromas with a little more to say. (Which is a good thing.) Still the bouquet is far from impressive. The malt is pleasantly rich with sweetness like caramel covered chocolate fruit. I like the spicy green apple aromas at the back, faint hints of cloves and ginger. Bready. Raisins soaked in rum. There is admirable intricacy in the fragrances, however the strength just doesnt electrify me. It is still inviting. The palate is very impressive. First of all, there is a tremendous liveliness to the taste. This is the first step to a great beer, IMO. Big beer needs to be talkative. This one is chatty. The rich, malty qualities blend with alcohol and fruit. Surely it is not that simple? It is not. Luscious malt depth, rich caramel flavor that is very wide and it dances with the raisins, purple grapes, plums, figs, coriander, clove, more malt (this time chocolate), and just enough alcohol heat to add yet another layer. What a tasty beer! There is tremendous complexity. If I ever get to drink this beer again, I will pair it with bananas, apples, grapes, cheese, and crackers. That would be a meal fit for a king. I am impressed at the fullness of this beer, medium/medium-full in body, low carbonation, which helps make a bigger than real mouthfeel. Lovely. To ask if this beer is drinkable is to ask if water is wet. I wish this beer were available locally. I know that Johns in Iowa City will get this on occasion. That wont cut it. But this bottle came from Bierman9. What a generous guy! Thanks. I really like this beer. I now personally understand why this beer is so legendary. The back-story and history of the brewery and the monks connect perfectly with a terrific beer. Recommended.

Mahogany.
Heavily aromatic, complex, winey nose of cherries, plums, currants, caramel and toffee.
Complex, melded flavor. Up front, the beer is lacking in my opinion but does possess notes of cherries and grapes. Mid-palate leans into a brandy-like sweetness, notes of caramel and pepper and finishes with hints of plums and berries. The alcohol is precisely hidden throughout the brew and it simply just doesn't show its potency. That being said, I truly don't find this beer to be all that flavorful and I never have. It's a great beer but I don't think its the best beer in the world. I can see why others do though. 746 charactersCrosling, Sep 08, 2004
4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My 100th BA review.
Picked up two bottles of this much sought after beer at the Bier Tempel in Brussels. No Labels, just a lot of information on the cap. Sampled in a 'Trappist Westvleteren' chalice, my Brussels souvenier.
The beer pours a mysterious extremely dark brown with no light penetration. Theres a massive off white head that lasts the entire glass and leaves behind huge swathes of lace in its wake.
The aroma is of dark fruits, apples, christmas pudding, nutmeg, cloves and some other incredibly aromatic components that defy my olefactory cabilities.
The taste is so incredibly smooth and subtle with a whole range of different flavors that blend seamlessly together. Theres an immensely fruity malt character upfront with berry, apple, mango, plum and pear notes. Theres also nutmeg, clove, black licorice and a great fresh raisin bread flavor. Hints of caramel are also there. The hops are evident only in the back of this cacaphony of interesting flavors. This beer tastes remarkably perfumey and floral.
This beer is the smoothest Belgian beer Ive ever tried. It doesnt hit you with overt malt or alcohol flavors right off the bat like Chimay, Orval or Maredsous its much more understated and subtle. The flavors start softly and build to a crescendo, lingering for a long time with an excellent aftertaste. The flavors also change from sip to sip.
The mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with a warming blanket of bubbles. The 10.5 ABV is evident but hidden very well, and what you do taste simply adds to the flavor (which isnt usually the case for me.
The massive hype surrounding this beer is absolutely justified. Pure beer perfection. Definitely the best Trappist Ive ever tried. Worthy of its long held place at the top of the vaunted Best of BA list. 1,789 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Sep 08, 2004
4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5200th review, cool...
11.2oz bottle from Vienna Whole Foods, Vienna, VA. 
Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, formed a 1/2" creamy beige head over the murky chestnut brew, with red highlights. Foam is here to stay, apparently, not fading, and laces well. Swirlign for aroma raises the head back to its original heights. Creamy, dark, fruity aroma, with tremendous depth of scent, if that makes sense. Needs to be experienced to be understood, I think. 
Taste is sweet initially, with fruity notes. Almost seems to evaporate on your tongue, leaving the slight alcohol flavors to mingle with the dark fruits. Mouthfeel is great, creamy and smooth, and drinkability is excellent, as you'd have to sit and drink a few before nailing down everything that's going on for the senses. Unfortunately, abv kind of prevents you from re-examining many in a row, and then there's that whole availability problem. As was the 8, worth the search to enjoy... 950 charactersppoitras, Sep 08, 2004

Aroma is of dark fruits, raisins, "pastries", and is very malty. 
So damned smooth and velvety. Taste is big on malt, with a bit of spiciness brought on by the alcohol which is fairly prevalent. Again a "pastry-like" sweetness. Some yeast.
This stuff will hit hard, because of the alcohol and the price. I wouldn't say that the drinkability suffers to much though, as this is truly a special occasions sort of beer. $9 is a little tough on the wallet for one brew.

This has been my holy grail of beers for over a year now. High expectations abound. Pours a deep red/brown color with no signs of co2 other than a nice large tan head. The head diminishes relatively quickly and leaves a nice creamy layer. Lace clings to the glass. The aroma is rich and earthy; malt and dried fruits, plums and spices. Hints of bubblegum and candy sugar. Flavor has a sweet start with quick effervescent spreading (rolling) of a dry metallic hop bite. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy and surprisingly effervescent.
Flavor appears one-dimensional at first, but becomes obviously more complex and mellows as it warms. More dry than I had expected. A great warming sensation and a nice buzz that seems to come only from the Trappist brews. 849 charactersSeanChouffe, Aug 17, 2004
4.56/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Without light, this beer looked...brown. With light, it became an amorphous whitish brown and showed alternating specks of color. Complex cherry red rose color. Glistening tight foam seems to wash up and cling to the sides of the glass.
Smell showed alot of red fruits and alcohol. Sweet malts, notes of figs and cloves. Spicier as warmed. Had higher expectations.
Taste shot down the slide from red fermenting strawberries in the mouth to a pit of baking chocolate in an instant before the liquid seems to undergo some chemical reaction and creams into microfine bubbles that twinge down the throat. 
Really a unique drinking experience, especially as far as the mouthfeel and drinkability go. Superfine bubbles and dynamic mouthfeel are incomparable, and the drinking only gets smoother and smoother.
Had this at 5 in the morning while doing some last minute packing. Will have to try it again... 910 charactersdonnebaby, Aug 10, 2004

Some bubblegum. Brown sugar. Very sweet nose. The flavors are very delicate, yet complex. Sweet melon like tones. Light rum alcohol. Candy and more candy. And then a dry wash of spice cleans up. Very flavorful....even in it's fragile nature. For such a big beer, this is incredibly drinkable. Mouthfeel is very light and airy. Carbonation is moderate. Very enjoyable brew. 482 charactersBighuge, Aug 10, 2004
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I ordered this from Delilah's in Chicago for $12.
It was aged since 1997.
Appearance was an opaque chestnut brown with no head except for a tiny patch of tan bubbles and a ring around the glass. The beer was definitely carbonated, though. I asked the server to pour the yeast in the glass.
First sniff was a woody, earthy, fruity smell that made my mouth water. 
The taste is a kung-fu master combination of sweet port-like notes, fruit, and wood. It has a woody caramel malty-sweet aftertaste that seriously lasted for more than a minute (I timed it.)
This is one very complex beer that is not tiring to my palate. I would reach for another if they weren't so expensive!
Mouthfeel is slightly oily and smooth with a pleasant crispness from the carbonation.
The Arrogant Bastard I had afterward seemed lame in comparison.
If this is aged beer, I hope I live a long life! 894 characterssilenius, Aug 09, 2004
4.13/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Oh my....is it the fact that this is so hard to get that makes it so good? According to the beer dude I talked to, the monks don't make this to sell. After a tour of the brewery, they offer each visitor a case to purchase. That's it. So, some guy in Belgium decided he'd hire people to take the tour and buy a case. In the great words of Homer, "MMMM...forbidden donut." Could be an urban beer legend, but I digress. The beer is tasty.
It pours a deep brownish-red with a healthy head that hung well until the last sip. The lace left on the glass was like a glass dipped in soapy dishwater. The sediment was present while drinking and at the bottom of the glass.
The smell of the beer surprised me. It wasn't as "dark" of a smell as I imagined it would be. To me it smelled slightly sweet, with a mild beer aroma.
The taste was very good. Mild, creamy, complex...it took me from sweet, to bitter, to fruity to malty and back to sweet again. Raisins, prunes, nuts and yeast balanced well with the malt.
The mouthfeel was a bit of a zing at first but rounded out nicely as it hit every taste bud on my tongue. I even savored the aftertaste. The high alcohol content gave a nice, slow burn all the way down.
The only downfall for me in drinkability was the price. At $11.00 a bottle it would hurt my bank account a bit to drink more. 1,345 charactersGuinness4me, Aug 01, 2004
3.76/5  rDev -18.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5After a bit of hunting, I finally tracked down a bottle of this coveted brew. A faint stamp on the cap declares it to have been bottled on 30.07.01.
The beer within pours a mostly clear ruby red on perhaps the first couple ounces, whereupon the bottle conditioning disengages itself to swamp up the brew considerably. I notice that trappist ales seem to have a very loose yeast, and it finds its way into your glass with even the most careful of pours. The yeast swims in large, fleshy clumps, slowly settling to the bottom of the glass in a loose heap. The liquid looks something similar to pond water, a rich, earthy brownish red. Atop the beer floats a huge, tightly packed ivory froth. Great head retention, keeping a half finger's thick crown atop the beer for the life of the goblet. Very impressive for the beer's strength (11% according to the cap). Some sticky blobs of lace cling to the glass, forming a weak, broken cobweb effect.
The aroma is very surprising. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Very nutty and chocolately, with a pervasive vinous feel. The malt is very muddy, earthtoned, with a belgian biscuity haze. Burnt, sugary toffee drizzled with dark chocolate and cashew. Very deep fruitiness, with ripe, squishy cherry, rotting plum, date and fig. The vinous feel has a bit of cardboardy oxodization around the edges, furthering the muddy haze. A sweetish, leathery scent grows with warmth, soft alcohol barely present under it all. Complex, but in a strange obscured way.
The flavor almost has nothing to do with the aroma. A surprise attack of sugary sweetness hits the tongue on the first sip, just shy of cloying. Toasty, drizzled with maple sugar and caramel filled, the candi sugar just engulfs your palate with a hazy fugue of drugged saccharine sweetness. A molasses-slow river of fruit syrup follows the sugar, coating the malt with a dark purple layer of just about every fruit you can imagine. Mostly a gooey plum sauce, with distinct currant, fig, banana and apple. The yeast presents itself within the fruitiness, a strange, eccentric blend of cashew, leather, crumbling treebark and walnut. Very odd. Interesting, but not entirely pleasing to the tastebuds. The yeast gains some strength into the finish, a more pronounced nutty wierdness blending with very attractive spicy belgian yeast qualities, as well as plastic-like, clovey phenols. A bit of sourness, and a brush of licorice. The finish is very long, the whole experience seeming to move at a snail's pace. The woody, nutty flavors continue, the glazed fruit reasserting itself in the very end. Some roasty chocolate flavors, as well as toffee, creating a fuzzy malt effect. A soft lick of alcohol in the swallow, with a sludgy, syrupy prune fruitiness lingering on the palate like a gob of molten caramel. Very heavy bodied, almost milky, furthering the lackadaisical mouthfeel. The carbonation is decent, but it seems to have trouble moving the beer around the palate. It's velvety and fine bubbled, perhaps something a little more attenuated would suit it better.
Really one of the most complex beers I've ever sat down to. A full bottle presents new flavors with each sip, some dwindling with warmth as others take their place. With the complexity came some unpleasant flavors, and I thought the sweetness was overbearing, especially when approaching room temperature. I didn't care for the yeast flavor, which was quite prominent, or the muddy drone of the malt, but that could have something to do with a couple years on the brew. Maybe the brew would present itself differently when fresh. I'd hope for something a bit more toned and alert feeling. A fine belgian ale, but nothing I'd consider world class material. I'm actually surprised at how well regarded this is. Possibly something to do with it's scarcity? I don't expect I'll be paying $9 for a second bottle, nor going through the trouble to get it. One was more than enough. It certainly does have personality, and I doubt I'd ever mistake this for another beer. 4,054 charactersUnionMade, Jul 31, 2004

Smell is malty and spicy, lots of grape and apple smells. Brown sugar and maple add to the sugar smells.
Taste is sweet and very sugary. Prominent sugar and fruit tastes. Lots of brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. Delicious spice flavors, Pepper and cardamom are foremost. Nice bitterness in the aftertaste. Malt and Biscuit flavors come through after a bit. Woody and earthy flavors complete the brew, mushrooms and oak flavors.
Mouthfeel is very good, thickish with champagne bubbles.

Nose is dark sweet dark fruits....plums and burgandy cherries...I actually liked the nose on the 8 a little better....body is much fuller and substantial than the 8...this feels like a sipper..creamy, buttery smoothness....still this is sliding down way too quick...very smooth and sweet...flavors swirl around...some caramel covered cherries....plums dipped in brown sugar.... just enough spicyness(black pepper and a small hit of alcohol) to keep things in check....
This is an excellent beer...perhaps not my personal favorite for #1 but no arguments here..it is certainly worthy..a world class beverage I wouldn't mind having around for special occasions.

4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought this in a beer store in Brugge so it was a plain brown bottle with a cap that has the number 12 on it. 
It pours a very dark brown with a fairly thick tan head. The head does not last as long as I had expected and left no lace on the glass. Instead the beer left an oily film.
It aroma is very, VERY malty with a finish of earthy hops. As the beer warmed, the aroma became more caramelly.
The taste is BIG time complex. It is sweet to begin and building sweetness as the beer lays on the tongue. About half way through, a hoppy bitterness creeps in and builds. In the finish, the sweetness is large and the alchohol bangs through. 
The mouthfeel is medium fullness. The alcohol tingles the tongue and roof of the the mouth.
This has to be one of the best beers I have ever tasted. It is so complex that my pallete was exhausted after drinking one. It is a beer that you will never forget. 910 charactersLarryKemp, Jul 05, 2004

4.54/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have. Now.
My Westy12 deflowering began with a muddied, amber-tilted brown scattered with yeast particles. The head was beige and semi-short-lived.
After fooling around and reaching third base with Westy 8, this has long anticipated. Surely a defining moment. 
The time arrived, and the bottle cap is awkwardly slipped off. 
Head swimming and bursting and dizzy. The room fragrant with spiced rum cake, lime juice, clove, and pepper.
A heavy, petting caramel begins the escapade. A bready mattress on which to romp. Caressing raisin fingers graze with slightly rough grain nails. Hotter now. Derobed cognac, naked, but shrouded in shadow. Elongated, excited rods of liquorice. Spice draws closer, and penetrates with silken and throbbing anise, white pepper, and clove. Squeezing and rhythmic plum pudding and carrot cake. 
From here on, the mind only recalls images, mere snapshots. Moaning figs and thrusting dark chocolate and grimacing florals. Squeals of passion fruit, then spurts of lime juice. 
Sweaty, sappy, heavy embrace. Full of momentum and ambiance, but not free from missteps. A bit clingy afterward. Roll over, and go to bed. 
Not perfect, but in the moment, it nearly seemed as such. 
Done too soon, but that's not a flaw. At least not here.
This will ever be looked back upon longingly, and with a sly grin. Certainly not the best, most erotic, or most complete one will experience (in fact, I'm calling Ms. Abbaye des Rocs right now). 
Regardless, this is absolutely lusty and gratifying. 1,577 characterscokes, Jun 10, 2004
4.28/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The time has finally come to put a splash of beer in my BA mug and what better beer than Westvleteren 12? I've had two of these in my cellar for about six months now and have been saving them for a special occasion. Something tells me that the contents have held up just fine. 'Best by' date on the yellow cap is 01.07.06.
The pour generates the typically massive Belgian head and I can see small chunks entering my chalice when the bottle is about 2/3 empty. Extremely murky chestnut brown; the beer looks like strong, unfiltered apple cider. The ecru colored cap has barely fallen in the three minutes since the pour. I'm expecting a huge amount of Belgian lace, but it hasn't yet had the chance to form since the head is so obstinate. 
The aroma is more subdued than expected, but to be fair, I'm trying to assess it through a still thick cap of foam. What I do appreciate is brown malty, fruity and toasted nutty. I also pick up whiffs of Belgian yeast and alcohol. 
The flavor profile is complex to say the least. It's comprised of loads of caramel malt, molasses, licorice, and dark, dried fruits (raisins, dates and prunes). Candied pecans and modestly funky yeast make appearances, as does the aforementioned alcohol. There are also darker contributors such as coffee and chocolate. Simply an amazing collection of seemingly unlimited flavors. The mouthfeel is big and firm, chewy even, but stops short of full or heavy.
Westvleteren 12 is world-class, no doubt about it. I can appreciate this beer (I think), I respect this beer, I even like this beer a lot. I just don't love this beer. Call me a hophead, call me an unrefined simpleton, call me what you will, but that's how I feel at this juncture in my journey. That doesn't mean that Westvleteren 12 is anything less than incredible. Everyone should have the chance to sample it at least once. 1,861 charactersBuckeyeNation, Jun 06, 2004
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I've been sitting on this one for quite a while now. Broke it out this weekend with Stopper. The bottle has been chilled for many months since purchase. The bottle foams outupon opening. Poured into a real ale fest glass. The beer pours a rich mahogany color with a beige fluffy head that settles slowly. There are lots of dark brown yeast chunks floating thorughout the pour. 
Aroma is rich, complex, and sweet. I get cloves, raspberry, and for the first time ever bubblegum. Very appealing on the nose.
The first sip reveals a fairly thick body with very fine yet prickly carbonation. Flavor is spicy and fruity. I get a little green apple and some caramel and toffee notes. Almost like a toffee hard candy in fact. These flavors roll to a bit of a warming alcohol character on the finish. I also get a bit of chocolate on the finish, not like candy but hot cocoa powder. 
This is a very complex beer and I am very glad to finally have tried it and add the bottle to my collection. Is it the best beer I've ever had? Tough to say, Top 15 easy. Go and look for it! 1,068 characterssulldaddy, May 25, 2004
4.54/5  rDev -1.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This gusher finally settles with a giant light tan head that's not overly persistent, atop a brown body with copper notes. Dark brown yeast flocs populate the glass and take their time settling. A huge malty aroma leaps from the glass, with a strong merlot-like vinous quality and a touch of vinegar. Smooth sweetness and spritzy carbonation battle for predominance as a many-layered symphony of malt and alcohol warms and entices the palate. This finishes wit a moderate alcohol heat and mild earthy hop character that emerge and linger as the formidable malt dissipates. 572 charactersStopper, May 25, 2004
4.83/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle: Poured a deep ruby colored beer with a huge thick foamy dark white head with incredible retention (the head was still in place when drinking the last sip of this beer 30 minutes after the bottle had been opened). Carbonation is really good with lots of bubble at the bottom of the glass and some other ones sticking on the side of the glass. Aroma is comprised of light and sweet roastiness with a nice touch of spice but I could not detect any alcohol. Taste is an almost perfect mix between caramel malts, candi sugar and something else, which might be cinnamon. I was really glad that I could not taste the alcohol since it could have been quite harsh at 10.2%. Wow, what a beer. I originally thought that this might be a bit of an over hyped beer but Im glad to report that it lives up to all the praises. 819 charactersPhyl21ca, May 14, 2004
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Amazing appearance. The head was fine and thin and disappeared quicker than for the westvlteren 8. The body is of a great opaque dark purple color. Great smell: yeast and cereals give this wonderful impression of fresh baked bread with some flour aspect. It also has a winy aspect, but not the hint of smoke the number 8 had.
The taste is a perfect and subtle balance of dark caramel malts and kind of hidden so floral hops. I got the impression to eat a slice of amazing bread: this beer's so nutritive. A veil of citrus and a note of raisin and grape appear also, with a wooden and slightly tart aspect of some great wines . What an amazing beer! A masterpiece that wonderfully hides its power. I had read a lot about it, I had thought about it a lot, and I will continue to do so... 786 characterstjd25, May 07, 2004
4.6/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4So here I am with the fabeled Westy 12. There is no beer in the world as highly regarded as this. As I look at the bottle, I can't help but to think that this is no different than looing upon a Jackson Pollock painting. A true piece of art. I wanted to wait for a while to drink this, but we all know what it's like holding a piece of cake in your hand and being told not to eat it.
It poured a dark reddish brown colour. It was more like the colour of blood than anything else. The head was a frothy two finger cloud that released aromas that just filled the room. Chocolate, toffee, caramel, nuts and grains filled the air causing great antisipation.
The taste is so complex yet so smooth. I first noticed toffee that soon blended with chocolate, caramel, nuts, grass, and apples. I have never tasted anything like it before.
I thouroghly enjoyed this beer. I can't wait for the other to be opened. Only a couple more years to go. 935 charactersCBFanWish, May 06, 2004

anywho:
poured out a deep brown hazy color with a huge head, i had trouble getting the head to go away so i could actually drink the beer. I like a nice size head but this one is a little overkill in my opinion.
smelled great, some fruit, and a big nutty smell comes out, some bread.
taste: very nice, much like the smell, but the taste I recived mostly nut and a light sweetness, it went down very smooth though and the alcohol was well hidden but very warming.
I think its a very drinkable beer but I can say I would not spend the 8 - 9 bucks for a 12 ounce bottle again. If I had my choice I would go after the blue cap first 782 characterskegerator, May 06, 2004

Taste: Wow. The most complex beer I've ever had. It's flavor starts with malt, goes to sweet bananas and figs, then nuts and malt, finishing with alcohol and bitterness. Very hearty. More forgiving than I expected. 
Mouthfeel: The beer has a smooth feel partly due to the light carbonation.
Drinkability: For a quadruple, this beer is very drinkable. It doesn't sit as heavy in the stomach as other beers, yet is rich and hearty. This beer is an absolute joy to drink.

Smell: Raisins and malt dominate the aroma. Faint yeast bite. Faint hints of licorice and toffee. Has that lovely Trappist Beer aroma that first hooked me into being a beer geek.
Taste: Holy sheetz. My my my. Hits the tongue like a chilled caramel latté, transforms to toffee and chocolate and malt mid palate. Mid-palate also brings out the Belgian candy sugar flavors. The finish trots out a noticable hop bitterness. Noticable alcohol texture. 
Mouthfeel: Perfection. The bead is neither too large nor too small. The beer is creamy without being cloying, bubbly without being fizzy.

Just below cellar temp, the taste opens harsh -- dynamic, but filled with alcohol. As it warms, the malt comes forward to balance the alcohol. Westvleteren Abt 12 tastes like a spiked fruit punch in the Garden of Eden. What else? Everything else. 
Numb, drying finish with a nice dose of hops that manages to carry a good amount of residual sugar. This beer knows what I'm going to say about it. The flavors in Westy 12 are capable of turning on a dime and making me think twice. The fruit -- now candied oranges, papaya, and rotten red grapes -- lingers on into the mouths of my future children.
Relax, relax.

The beer pours an orangey dark brown color that reflects a garnet red in the light. The head is large and slightly off white. Creamy looking and retains well. Leaves an inconsistent lacing on the glass. I served it a little cold, but I could still make out a spicy apple cidery smell, lots of apple, hints of banana, currants? 
The flavors come on in waves. There is no hop bite but rather a mild to moderate bitterness with none of that Pale Ale floral character... fades to a dry finish. Quite smooth. Reminds me of cognac. I get sweet malt and caramel -- ah I'm getting the sugar now. There's licorice and spiciness and something else I can't describe. It's full bodied and rich and darn smooth. The finish is dry but you still have the taste of complex fruit in your mouth. The alcohol moves in with gradual warmth. I sip it over and over and it remains a complex mystery to me. I must have more and more. It makes me hungry though I just finished lunch. I have some special Chinese duck that has been cooked with soy sauce and spices (five spice?) and they go together perfectly. Finally at the end my head is spinning with the alcohol. This would've kicked ass in the middle of my lunch. I can see why BAs love this beer. I'm glad I bought an extra bottle! 1,322 charactersoggg, Mar 29, 2004
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Welcome to my 200th review. Can't say I'm the most poetic reviewer here but I try. For this momentus occasion I chose Westy 12 sine it appears to be a Holy Grail beer here.
Pours a dusky garnet with a couldronous eggshell colored head. The foam settles out in to a bubbling sheet of lace. 
Smells strongly of candi sugars and very dark fruit. There is something about the smell of quadrupels. I love them. Definitely a little alcohol lurking in the back of this one.
Lots of cherry and grape come to the front of this brew. Sugary malts rush in close behind to fill the void. Spices fill in closely and then it finishes quite peppery, dry, and warms like a kerosene heater.
Mouthfeel is very big. Slick, malty, and filling.
Drinkability. I think this one has sipability. It needs to be taken slowly like a brandy or single malt. It's in that class of beverage. 875 charactersyankeeheel, Mar 27, 2004
4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The Westy 12 pours a tawny brown and has some dirty brown sediment drippings towards the end of the pour. Settles super opaque as a rosey dark brown color with a finger high crown of dark ivory creamyness, fading evenly and slow to a hazey broken skim and a firm collar hugs the edge of the glass a good portion through the session. Lace quickly slips back in with minimal spots sticking.
Aroma is soft and yeilding, complexing and layered; at it sits a welcoming orangey fruit yeast tone releases over some really nice cookie sugars and waffer light chocolate. Deeper wiffs bring out some darker fruits within of raisin and fig with soft dry woodish earthyness. Slight phenolic notes emerge here and there as it warms giving it a bit of spice and burn. There's more here then I can really put my nose too. Cocoa filled fruits and light spices is what I can figure. It's very appealing however way you smell it.
Taste has a refined roundness with an encompassing natural tasting softness of fruits, earth, yeast, spice, cocoa, and some slight roastyness. Its quite soft for what seems to be such a big beer. The flavors carry alot of the effects over from the aroma, lending a bit more dark fruits then the smell would lead you to believe is there and they're there in good stature. There's some artfully placed sweet malts throughout that bring out the darker fruits and sweetness bringing in raisin, fig, apple, and touches of banana, oh but there's a bit more that continues to ensue. There's delicately hidden melding of chocolate cookie sugars, bits of yeasty spices, and mild caramel. There's a milding woody earthyness that keeps a small drying presense throughout as well. Again, there's more here then a can put my mouth too and intermingles with the body and feel of the beer. Quite complex and full of softly spoken actions. Very enthusiatic and engrossing to say the least.
Feel is beyond words here. Wow! Amazingly full, yet calmingly smooth and fluffy with a heavenly fine carbonation that continues to give way to the flavors, never too sharp and never too distant. Well rounded, superbly soft, and exceptionally drinkable. Its nearly a meal! It doesn't seem to have 10.8% ABV, its masked very well. One isn't enough, not nearly enough. I will need to get more, alot more, and hopefully begin to pick out what it is about this beer that makes my eyebrows raise and my mind go "huh? and wow!" Loftly, noble, sublime; wonderfully put together. Thank you Gusler! 2,483 characterstavernjef, Mar 26, 2004

4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Malto for this aged bottle.
It pours out subdued brown with a white cap that it wears like a crown. The nose is plummy, old leather and tobacco but the taste is a oh my god experience. Beers like Double Bastard, Storm King 
and even other Trappiste beers assert their greatness with a raised fist that makes you take notice. Westy is amazing because it is complex as the best Bordeaux and subtle in ways that are hard to describe. I had a bottle of Rochefort 10 before this beer and it tasted less balanced than the higher alcohol Westy.
This beer is so far away from Macro beers that I can't believe they are related. 635 characterscanucklehead, Mar 24, 2004
4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Disclaimer, it is the first time I have this beer along with 6 other comparable, 5 of which are classified as ABTs and there's only one among the 6 that I've had before. Only one was not taken blind (ommegang three philosophers). So basically, I've taken the 5 following beers blind in the same session: rochefort 10 (only one I had before), westvleteren 12, st-bernardus 12, weyerbacher quad, gulden draak. All 5 were taken in a Chimay chalice A deep chocolate body with a fully diminishing off-white head, initially well-laced. Bottle-conditionned, with some beige sediments at the bottom. Aroma is a nice blend of vanilla and chocolate (black, brown and white), milkshakish, slightly vinous. It didn't grab me particularly, but seriously, let this warm and this becomes a tremendously complex malt offering. Full-bodied, creamy with a good carbonation. Taste is loaded with dark fruits: blackberries, plums, dates. It's a complex caramel cream with a chocolate syrup, no it's a cake, it's a pudding with a little alcohol bite. Very complex with a well-expressed yeastiness. Definitely the most complex of the ABTs. It's delicious for sure, but doesn't strike to me as the best beer in the world. It's the best balanced of the big dark ABT trappist styles to my liking, but it's not necessarily the most intense, although such a refined aftertaste is hard to match. Maybe I will rate it higher in a future tasting. It sure held the competition in a blind tasting, so I know this is pure world-class stuff, I'll have to get into deeper analysis eventually and will definitely enjoy doing so. By the way, this was a nice fit with the great quebeccer cheese Victor et Berthold, recommended by Simon_Patrice and provided by MartinT. Big cheers to Ciderguy and Hopsrus for each hooking me up with a westy 12. 1,805 charactersRastacouere, Mar 07, 2004
4.2/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a deep caramel/amber color with a large white and good sticky lace.
Aroma has hints of raisins, coriander, anise, some honey, some citrus fruit, caramel/toffee and grain.
Flavor is extra smooth starting with some caramel maltiness that quickly cedes to a classic Belgian spice profile and some dark grains. 
Mouthfeel is highly alcoholic but not at the expense of a pleasant spicy and somewhat dry but sweet finish.
Drinkability is probably as high as it gets although complexity makes this one to sip and savor. 522 charactersCRJMellor, Mar 01, 2004

Appearance: Murky chestnut/mahogany brown topped by a small khaki head of foam which recedes to a scant film of bubbles after a minute or so. Wee specks and gobs of lacing on the glass.
Smell: A healthy dose of candi sugar aromas and fruity esters of apples, cherries, and plums. Stale hops notes a la Belgium, too.
Taste: Sweet caramel malts and candi sugars, fruity tastes of plums, raisins, and apples. Aftertastes of Belgian hops. Wonderful segues between the flavors. Booze also makes its presence felt, taste wise.
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, but not as creamy as Bernie 12. Slight warming sensation from the alcohol.
Drinkability: Tasty and well made, but I believe I like Bernie 12 better. It's darker, richer, and a bit more complex - but only by a hair, palate-wise. Wallet-wise, I like Bernie 12 by a toupee. Worth seeking out as you might disagree with my assessment Re: Bernie 12 v. Westy 12. 1,021 charactersManekiNeko, Feb 23, 2004

Poured a hazy dark caramel with a small, creamy mocha head. It had a rich, well blended malty aroma with only a hint of alcohol -- one of the most pleasant aroma's I've encountered. The mouthfeel was almost more like eating than drinking -- it was full and flavorful; thick and heavy on the palate with a nice carbonated highlight. I detected toasted, chocolaty hints, but the alcohol was quite discernable. Blended enough to fit well with the flavor, but a definite alcohol presence. Highly drinkable for the style. 739 charactersjtfest, Feb 20, 2004

Excellent in its bitterness, but there is just too much alcohol (read lack of balance) and way too thick (any beer thicker thank heavy whipping cream is too thick). 452 charactersNaerhu, Feb 13, 2004

An immediate rich, bready aroma wafts from my glass as I pour this beer. This beer is topped by a light brown head that sits atop a brown beer. There are notes of sherry, plum, and raisin (though the raisin is definitely the most dominant aroma) in the nose. The beer smells sweet & rich as well. Well the taste is fairly rich & sweet; there is lots of fig and plum notes, which are joined by a woodiness that is in the taste as well. This beer was an awesome way to finish my great dinner at the Hop Leaf. There is an astringent complexity to this beer that just brings it to a whole other level, and there is a slightly musty character that integrates well with the rest of the flavors. I can fully understand why many consider this a world class beer. I really like how this beer is quite fruity in both the aroma and in the taste. The alcohol is very well hidden here, I can't really detect it at all. The rich sweetness is very conducive to being an after dinner drink. This beer is like a rich, dark, sweet traditional German bread. What makes this beer so good is that it is extremely well integrated; absolutely world class.

4/4/4/5/4
A vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two-finger thick, creamy, tan colored head. The beer is a dark, concentrated amber color that when held up to the light shows that I poured quite a bit of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle into my glass, but is also a hazy, bright cherry color. The aroma smells of spices and fruit with a rich, caramelized maltiness to the finish. Aromas of fig cake, brandy soaked fruit cake, some marzipan, clove, dried cherries, white pepper, candied ginger form the bright aromatic notes. There is a nice backbone here of must and damp earth, as well as some toasted malt character that provides a biscuit malt aromatics. Some higher alcohols provide a bit of spiciness as well as some warming character to the tail end of each draught of the nose. This has quite a rich nose to it, both the fruit and spices accentuate the perceived sweetness of the aroma.
Up front this beer is a bit lighter than I expected, as it rolls across my tongue though it starts to pick up a viscous richness and heft, though it still maintains the drinkability that I like to have in a strong Belgian ale. The beer has a definite sweetness (though not as much as the aroma might have suggested), but finishes with a spiciness that helps to dry the palate out. The beer is a bit carbonated still after the vigorous pour and it provides a prickly carbonation as it rolls across the tongue. fruit notes of prunes, musty figs and raisin are brought out by a touch of tartness as well as the sweetness in this beer. There is a definite mustiness to this beer, it is oxidation character that it has picked up over the years, and it mixes nicely with the spiciness in the finish. Speaking of which, the spiciness provides notes similar to white pepper, clove, a nutmeg like bite, some woody ginger and a touch of menthol in the long finish as well as some bitter cocoa. This definitely gets more complex as it warms up from the high 40°F (~8°C) that it started out at. The alcohol in the finish combines with the fruitiness to reminds me of Brandy.
Well I had a bug dive bomb this beer, so it must have though there was something worth drinking in my glass (one of my dogs got a tasty, Westy soaked morsel because of that). While this beer is quite good, I am quite disappointed in some ways. I haven't had this in a couple years, and I am thinking I need to try a fresher version to see if it is more like my memory of having this in Belgium and at the Hop Leaf (where I had it last). 3,782 charactersGueuzedude, Feb 09, 2004

Smell - Fruity, spicy, and a tinge of alcohol. Typical Belgian-like smell. Wonderful.
Taste - As the bottle instructed, I let this one warm up a bit to what I hope was about 50 degrees. Wanted to get the full flavor. Glad I did. Wow. A very nice fruity beginning with a bread-like middle. Maybe some nuts mixed in. The flavor was very full, and a lot more mild than I thought it would be, which was a very plesant surprise.
Mouthfeel - Smooth and easy. Goes on and off the palate without any offensive or tart notes.
Drinkability - Very drinkable for this style. Even though the alcohol content is high, and so is he price tag, this is one fine brew. A good beer to have two or three while enjoying a nice winter night.
Overall: Complex, tasty...a must try! 969 charactersEdwin, Feb 02, 2004

Lacing forms in nice bands the typical belgian style lacing going down, overall great appearance. Aroma: A blissful mixture of different scents, this beer serves up a great spiced tone, then a warming sweet dough character, blended with raisins and alcohol. The vinous tone is the hallmark characteristic the one that stands out just a great experience even if it costs 10 to 12 dollars a bottle. Taste: Alcohol is warming and blends with a shortbread cookie and overly ripened fruit quality, cloves and spices are evident as well this beer is good stuff very complex. Mouthfeel: Full bodied soft silky carbonation coats the palate with a pleasant sensation. Drinkability: Massive amounts of flavor and complex aroma equals a satisfying drinking session this beer doesn't mess around very big, and unique all on it's own. Can't say their anything that compares besides the St. Bernadus Abt. 1,081 charactersWVbeergeek, Feb 02, 2004

Paler than I remembered - a dark brown with a head that has strangely large bubbles but settles to a creamy top. The aroma is godly. The esters that come out of that yeast just lend a complexity that is more refined than just about anything else I have smelled or tasted. Taste is soo smooth and has everything in perfect balance. The dark caramel, the raisin, the chocolate, the sweetness, the hops, the yeast, the esters, the alcohol. Wonderful and extremely drinkable. The last bottle that I had of this I thought the alcohol flavor was too present, but I find this one to be just right.
Many thanks to Paquette for importing this gift by hand. 739 characterswaughbrew, Jan 30, 2004
4.23/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Funniest thing- bought a box of the westvleteren collection, with a glass included at 'de bier tempel', and, unlike the others which were label less as well, this one was bottled in an abbaye de scourmont bottle. Random. checked with a couple of people. supposed to be OK anyways.
As for the beer itself, I guess what happens normally is that you come with too high expectations. So when you rate this you either seem disappointed, or give it a subconcious peer pressure high rating.
I think I give it what it deserves, for it's quite a nice representation of the style, with a good flavour and colour, although to my taste, and biasedly comparing with Westy 8, this one is a bit too light in taste and a bit too evident in alcohol. It lacks a bit of carbonation too-to mask the alcohol a bit as well. the abundant hops at the end compliment it though in a nice way.
The visuals, though, are very nice, as for the dark brown head that is very porous and the abundant sediment at the bottom. The nose, although fruity and complex, was also weak.
Very good beer. Not *the* best. 1,088 charactersAndreji, Jan 27, 2004
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I picked up a bottle of this fine stuff yesterday. The cap had a computer-generated date of 14.01.06 marked on it, and the beer was $8.79.
The beer poured a nice deep brown color with hints of dark red. A two-finger head -- a light/medium tan -- from the pour settled into a 1/4" ring that clung to the glass for a while and finished off at about 1/8". The flavor was big and complex, and I noted roasted almonds/walnuts, some high-cocoa dark chocolate (i.e. Lindt 85%), some coffee (particularly the sweet Thai-style ice coffee), and some savory, dried fruits -- mostly raisins/figs/dates. The alcohol was never overpowering.
The mouthfeel was fantastic. light to moderate on the carbonation, warm, and sweet, which really opened up the senses to the huge flavors. I also noted a medium to long finish.
To sum it up, this is a phenomenal beer. I really enjoyed it on its own (several hours after a meal), and I plan to drink it that way again to really take advantage of its complexity and craftsmanship. The cost is a factor, but the overall experience is worth the price of admission. I will definitely buy this beer again. 1,135 charactersMrBen, Jan 25, 2004
4.63/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a really, really deep dark ruby brown. Head and head retention are impeccable.
Aroma is very strong. I smell sweet malt, brown sugar, raisins, alcohol, dried cherries.
Flavor is rich and full. Heavy with dried fruits all over it with dark cherries coming through. The alcohol makes a cameo appearance but nothing more. The finish is dominated by the flavors of the fresh juice of a blueberry, as if I just took and squeezed a blueberry between by tongue and teeth, accompanied with the bitterness of the berry skin.
Mouthfeel is robust and full.
Drinkability is hampered by two things: the sheer magnitude of this brew, and the $$$$ that accompanies the beer. 677 charactersJables, Jan 13, 2004

For being such a firebreather it sure is some good drinkin'. If it wasn't for the crazy price I could drink it all day. 408 charactersSixpack595, Jan 05, 2004
4.22/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5So I caved to all the hype and found 2 bottles of this one in Orlando. I considered myself lucky. I stocked one away and put on in my fridge to try. I finally got around to pouring it out.
Appearance: First off, this beer looks amazing. The dark cloudy liquid filled the glass followed by a dark tan head. It just looked like it would keep you warm.
Smell: slight hops, malt, and fruit scents (think dark dried fruit, prunes, rasins). Alcohol.
Taste: Wow, that's a stong beer. This is definitely one to be savored and enjoyed over a period of time longer than a half hour. Full of flavor though, can definitely taste a hint of the dryed fruit and hops, as well as a slight woody flavor that was in no way bad.
Drinkability: Okay at, 10.2% alcohol I don't think I could handle this one in large doses, not to mention at $10 a bottle I don't think my wallet could either.
Overall: I am impressed. While it may be hyped to some extent, I can honestly say I have never tasted anything like it before and I look forward to that as-of-yet-unknown special occasion where I can break out my other bottle and sit down with a nice cigar and enjoy it. 1,155 charactersLuckySevens82, Dec 30, 2003

Aroma: a balanced hit of malt and clovey phenols, raisins, rum, a wisp of hops, acetone
Flavor: starts off with a subdued maltiness, then a strong alcohol flavor takes over which is then mitigated by a smooth sweetness, touch of chocolate, yeast, raisins, the finish is semi-sweet w/ a hop bitterness riding out in the aftertaste
Mouthfeel: medium-full body, gentle carbonation, creamy texture, nice alcohol warmth without the burn
Overall Impression: Finally, after all the hype, I tried this beer (yeah, shame on me for taking so long!). It does not disappoint. A world class beer, all the way. Definitely deserving to be in the top 50, just maybe not at #1. Come on guys, is the abv really that important!?! I tried to review this without the beer's "rep" clouding my judgement.

It pours a deep dark murky brown with and tannish beige head. An earthy aroma of cut hay, coffee, cocoa, sweet malt, hops and warming alcohol excites the olfactory senses. Sweet caramel malt, buttery biscuits, toffee, banana, lemon zest, light pine, hint of herbs and flavors of dark rum mingle and dance in perfect rhythm and harmony. This is a very drinkable brew for something of this strength. Velvety smooth and lush. Is there a perfect beer out there? Almost...try the Blue Cap Abt 8. 543 charactersBeerResearcher, Dec 29, 2003

Complex taste of sweet grainy malt, brandy soaked ripe stone fruits of all colors, and a bit of nuttiness. There was a tangy bitterness and mildly raw alcohol flavor that actually contributed to the overall experience by cutting the almost cloying sweetness. 
Full viscous, sticky, creamy mouthfeel with killer carbonation that made it feel smooth, velvety and supremely drinkable.

4.82/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance  Thick, dark brown with live carbonation and a monster head that went down slowly and puddled at the end.
Smell  Big, sweet, buttery malts lead this one off. This is followed by an array of fruity smells that are very rich and thick. Sharp, heavy maple and molasses bring up the rear of this BSDA, giving it a wonderful bouquet indeed.
Taste  This is exceptional. The rich buttery malt base is there, laden with alcohol. Behind that are the fruits. They are dark and extremely ripe. The overripe apricots, dark cherries, and figs all seem to be smashed together (well blended) and covered in sugars of all types, especially brown and raw.
Mouthfeel  Full in the body and extremely smooth and buttery. This one defines creaminess at its best. The carbonation is very live and fluffy.
Drinkability  This is truly a BSDA classic that lives up to the hype. It will always be towards the top of the ratings list.
Comments  With almost zero availability here in Seattle, I was thrilled when I got this one from OldFrothingSlosh in the Christmas Beer Exchange coordinated by Richard, Mr. Big Dog himself. Thanks to the giving spirit of the BA community for giving me the opportunity to try this most excellent Trappist Ale. 1,254 charactersRoyalT, Dec 26, 2003

The flavor of this beer is also one to savor and combined with the aroma is one that's hard to beat. That's one thing about this ale I found most impressive. The in your face aroma with the flavor is an onslought of your senses. The malty caramel and fruit flavor leads to a gentle warming sensation towards the middle of the glass.

The taste isn't the flavor explosion I was hoping for, but it was interesting. The aftertaste is lightly bitter, just enough to cut the flavor.

Bottle cap date of 20.03.05 (I assume a "best by" date?)
Poured a dark brown color with a thin head that remained until I finished the beer. Very pretty foam remnants stick to my glass. Yeast remained in the bottom of the glass even after the pour.
Smell is of alcohol, coffee, esters and cherry - very nice, quite deep.
The taste? Quite complex (as hoped for and expected). Many different flavors as it continues to warm. At first I get plum and caramel with a definite alcoholic taste. Later on an almost milky coffee flavor (this surprised me). Then malty characteristics (more surprises!) Then ester tastes and more caramel. Finally, as I finished the glass, I was hit with a lemon-like flavor. Amazing.
Easy to drink because it's so good, but the large alcohol content definitely was getting to me. Not sure yet if it's worth the $7.99 for a 12 oz. bottle, but it's still pretty amazing. 1,016 charactersjahred, Nov 30, 2003

Dark milk chocolatey brown with muddy clarity.
Aroma is warm leathery fruit aromas mix with chocolates and cherries and alcohol.
Malt is rich and chocolatey with cinnamon, persimmions and tropical grapes. 
Acidy sweet finish is long and lingering with spices and plums. 380 charactersdrewbage, Nov 29, 2003
4.11/5  rDev -10.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Well,
After reading all the hype I managed to order a few bottles of this from Vintage Cellar (www.vintagecellar.com). 
Color is exceptional, deep amber with an excellent head.
The first hit on the palate is smooth, clean with good malt and some slight floral hints. A nice warm alcohol rush (surprising) not unlike the warm fuzzy from a liquor.
As noted by everyone else, a very complicated beer. Lots going on with all sorts of flavor hidden in the smooth malts.
Too bad this beer sells for the equivalent of $1.50 in Belgium and costs about $11 a bottle over here whereas other Trappists start at about the same price and end up costing about $5-7 a bottle here. While it is an exceptional beer, it hardly qualifies as being worth the extreme price when you compare it to some of the quality micro-brews available for a fraction of the cost in the states.
Bottom line? Worth trying once unless you live in Belgium.

4.95/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Brought one bottle of this back from a trip to the Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, 9 days ago. $9.95 a bottle is pretty steep, so let's see what all the fuss is about. Pours an inviting cherry mahogany with a two finger head. Pleanty of lacing. Smells divine, but difficult to describe. Malt and fruitcake? Excellent feel in the mouth. Alcohol is definitely in there. Toffee, Kona coffee, plums, a lot going on here. Very tasty, almost like a separate course of a meal. Delicate lacing and a small yeasty head hang around for quite awhile. 
Almost to room temperature now. It's got a kick to it with the high abv. Highly complex all around. Definitely a special occasion brew at the price. This is the best Belgian strong ale I've had in my life, including a few I've had in Belgium. This Westy is, for sure, worthy of its reputation. No sediment noted, and I just drained the bottle. Keeps getting better, and leaves you with a warm feeling. Caramel aftertaste, in a good way. Whew! Quite an experience. 1,015 charactersmerlin48, Nov 18, 2003
4.72/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Cellared since 1999. Pours with a short lived almost white head featuring large bubbled laciness sitting atop murky brownish-red liquid. Slight oxidation in the nose when first poured, along with brown sugar and lots of malt. The taste is more brown sugar coated malts mixed with plenty of nuttiness followed by some alcohol prescence. Lingering thick maltiness on the palate as it warms, with spicy notes arising along with chocolate notes...sublime.

4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Westvleteren 12 is a beautiful ruby red that pours with a slight head. Nice lacing on my Chimay chalice as I sip. The nose is full of sour fruit - raisins and plums. The sour nose gives way to a very sweet taste (Belgian candi sugar), but balanced with some bready undertones. This beer could certainly get me through a fast. I'm not sure how the monks maintain their vow of silence after drinking this - all I want to do is talk about it. The body is quite light, actually, but it holds up to the ABV well and makes for a very drinkable beer. I can see how this would get better with age, as some of the residual sugars get munched on by the yeast. I think I'll have to pick up another bottle. I don't know if I am being swayed psychologically by this being the rarest Trappist beer, but it is truly amazing. 809 charactersColForbin, Nov 14, 2003

It looked nice enough, an exquisite brown red color, the aroma was malty sweet, with some citrus, but somewhat thin and evasive. The taste was supposed to be the thing, just send me to 7th heaven.Sorry. It was a straight malt citrus with hints of cherry. Nice enough, but simple.

4.58/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My second Westy ever! Also at the Kulminator.
Appearance: Like the 8, this beer poured a super drak brown and was accompanied by a huge, appetizing tan head. While it looked like alot of beers....worth a scoing of 4....i had to give it a 4.5 based on my anticipation. It just looked so good, i couldn't wait!
Smell: Although the nose had sweet chocolatey notes as well as spicey hints to it, i found that it was much more mild and subtle then i had anticipated.
Taste: Here we go!!! Wow. A wonderfuly rich beer with sweet and complex flavours throughout. Hints of chocolate and caramel. Spices of cinamon and nutmeg, maybe even a hint of molasses. Soem dark fruitiness and even some light woody notes towards the mildly bitter finish which also had a refined, port-like quality to it. 
Mouthfeel: Rich, creamy, complex...very warming and fullfilling. Tastes linger nicely and change even after you're done your sip.
Drinkability: It doesn't get much better than this! A world class beer. This one goes into my top 10 for sure. If i could only find more, i would buy them all. 1,090 charactersPopsinc, Nov 03, 2003
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The pour is a fuliginous deep cherry red color with a behemothic head, creamy in texture, and a beauteous light tan color, as the head unhastingly erodes; a splendid sheet of lace is formed to unite lovingly with the glass. Heavenly, is the word that best describes this nose, ambrosial, hints of over ripe fruit, yeast tones also noticeable along with a slight hint of alcohol, start is thickly malt, sweet, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is pleasantly acidic, the alcohol grasp the taste buds in a Anaconda death grip, the dry vinous aftertaste lingers long after the beer is gone, but certainly not as long as the memory of this fine beer as it stays in your sub-conscience like your first kiss. 722 charactersGusler, Oct 16, 2003

Fruity with raisins, plums and cherries interplaying with vanilla, chocolate and orange peel. Hides the 10.2% alcohol very well. This is one beer that is definitely worthy of all the hype/accolades it has received. Very smooth and extremely complex. Excellent beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry.

A nice mohogany color which light does shine through, with a tannish head, which doesnt last long but does leave a good amount of lace. Smells, well some spices, some prunes or raisins maybe, and some faint sweet citrus. A lot of malt hits the toungue right away followed by some dry fruits (maybe those prunes or raisins i smelled) with a spice/ hop subtlety at the end, paired with some alchohol. Only one word desribes the mouthfeel.... velvet, it is rich and smooth. Great beer all around, expensive but worth it. 598 charactersIanhockey91, Sep 19, 2003
4.3/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5As everyone knows, this is exceptional beer. Is it the best in the world? Time will tell, but I have an opinion that I will share.
I saved this bottle especially for my 500th review expecting it to be something very special and it is. Poured into an appropriate glass purchased for this special occasion, the lovely body is an exquisite light mahogany color and appears clear as the carbonation settles. The head comes up fairly nicely and produces about one finger's width of finely packed tan foam. But to my amazement this head is not lasting; in fact, it disappears quite quickly and leaves a thin filmy residue. That small residue is, however, covering the sides of the glass in a sheet of lace; not too sticky, mind you, but quite lovely in its brief coverage.
The aromas are, as advertised, quite complex. There's no missing the strong malt base and this is complemented by additional hints of dried fruit, perhaps prunes and raisins. Certainly there's some yeast action here, but quite subtle at that. As this warms the malt moves more to the fore and begins to add in some caramel to the mix.
The flavor is, well, complex. There's the malt and the dried fruit, alcohol creeps into the mix creating a lovely heating sensation to the mouth. Do I sense spice? I don't think so but I believe there's something else going on; I've added in the final dregs from the bottle and now the clearness is replaced by murkiness. The heat goes up and there's even more warmth in the mouth. Now we sense a very strong aftertaste and this is becoming very interesting as the flavors linger longer. Perhaps even a bit too much lingering as the burning increases and the long aftertaste moves to a mildy pungent and bitter state. Gone is the initial sweetness. So, too, is the sense of calm - this is strong beer that strengthens as it goes.
Incredible mouthfeel from this great beer - velvety and smooth. Creamy and full. I believe the feel to be the strongest attribute here. The alcohol is not as muted as I thought it would be and my drinkability rating is likely higher in this category than it should be, probably because of this beer's reputation. There is a coating to the mouth that lingers excessively long and is really more than a little annoying, thus I'm not at all sure that more than one would be to my liking.
A great beer? Certainly. The best in the world? Time will tell. 2,395 charactersAtLagerHeads, Sep 18, 2003
4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Small brown Euro bottle without the label. Well what can I add that hasn't already been described so perfectly. This is incredible beer. 
Medium burgundy color, shiny and glowing. Hints of ruby along the edges. Foamy, dense, soft bubbly beige head. Beautiful. 
First aromas are full of sweet carmel sauce, rum soaked raisans, and fruits. Some others have described the first taste it as bread pudding in a glass, that's about exactly what I experienced. rich full array of flavors. Rum soaked raisans, plums, cherries, and sweet cookie dough all wrapped up with a carmel sweet cookie. Snappy alchohol bite, some peppery fresh hop presence just for a second. Hints of honey, and freshly toasted grains. Flavors wash and soothe your tastebuds into submission. Supersmooth and rich. Perfectly charged, eases into your belly with a nice warming touch. One of the top 3 beers I have had, easily. Well worth the wait for a special occasion. I saved this one since last winter, cheers to the Belgian Bum for this treasure. 1,017 charactersStevieW, Aug 23, 2003

It's the most highly anticipated beer I ever had so I though there was no chance it would be as good as others have claimed. Ok, so I was wrong. Deep garnet color with a long lasting had. Fresh plums in both the aroma and the taste. Also hints of molassass in the taste. The level of complexity is unbelievable. This beer lives up to it's expectations and that's saying a lot. 417 charactersdmarch, Aug 19, 2003
4.6/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is packed with flavor and hides its 12% alcohol very well. I just wish it was easier to find!
It pours a clear dark ruby color with a thin tan head that dissolves to a thick ring around the surface. Some spots of lace cling to the side of the glass. The aroma is mainly caramel malts, raisins, cherry's and a mild hint of alcohol. Each sip of this smooth full bodied beer is like a velvet blanket covering the tongue. The flavor is a well balanced combination of caramel malts, raisins, cherry's, molasses and alcohol. There's a slightly sour fruity finish and aftertaste with each sip.
This is a beer I searched high and low for and was very excited to finally find a single bottle sitting all by itself at a local liquor store. The flavor is exquisite and I hope to find another bottle soon. 809 charactersWanderingFool, Aug 08, 2003

One of the villages, I can't pronounce the name yet alone spell it, had a large snake roaming around. My friends and I caught it and relocated it. One of the villagers offered me a beer as a reward. I said sure, expecting some Corona knockoff. It was this. Oh God, this is goooood. She poured this into a fattened wine glass. I don't know the style. Think champagne glass big enough to hold about a pint. It was a pleasant, ruddy red colour. Big head that needs some time to level down. Smelled alot of raisins, complex sugars, malt, a little alcohol, some more fruit I'm unsure of, and orange peel. Exceptional taste. The mixtures of fruit gave me a different taste every sip. The beer was served a little warmer than usual, which probably made it better. Beer aroma and taste are more pronounced when warm, and this is a very complex brew. Medium heavy mouthfeel. Only drink a few of these at a time. Drink it too enjoy it, not for the sake of drinking. 1,013 charactersslitherySOB, Aug 04, 2003

Very yeasty nose that was pleasant to smell. First taste was new to the tastbuds, almost velvety (not velveeta !) on the tongue. Great aftertaste. I bought the bottle for a mere $6.99 since it has been talked about so on the site. Worth every penny, and I will need to return to the only place I have seen it in NJ and buy some more. Lasting impression that I termed "great Belgian on steroids" to my wife. Her comments were different and interesting. She likes it also. 571 charactersGavage, Jul 26, 2003

While having little in the way of aroma (my only complaint), this beer proved to be exceptional. The medium-dark body and semi-thick consitancy amused me as I gently swirled in my glass. You would never guess this beer is 10,2%. Even my fruit-lambic (Lindemann's, Mort Subite, New Glarius) loving wife thought that this beer was a stand out.
Brought two Abt 12's, One Westy 8, and two Blondes home from Belgium. Can't wait to have it again!

4.47/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer poured a large frothy white/yellowish tan head that took several minutes to die down. It had a dark brown, almost black colored body with fine bubbles.
The nose of this beer had a lot of sweet fruit flavors. Apples, cherries, chocolate, roasted malt and a firm alcohol smell. I got a light spice hint and yeast smell as well. 
The initial taste was very mellow and smooth from start to finish. A very fine carbonation. Chocolate and cherry flavors dominate. Mixed in with some apple, raisins, dark roasted malt and caramel flavors as well. I could also taste some earthy wood tones, like natural wood or tobacco. Very subtle, but well blended with a very soft hop bitterness. Finishing with an alcohol warmth and soft fruit flavors.
I found this beer rather heavy and port like, but always easy drinking. On top of that, it had a very strong warm alcohol punch that never became overpowering.
I bought 2 bottles of this beer and tried it on 2 sepperate occasions to get a better picture of this beer. I liked the beer much more the 2nd time around. I found that I actually enjoyed the beer a few degrees cooler than the recomended 55-60 degrees.
Overall this is a really great beer. Although I feel it's a little overrated for it's $10 price tag. I'll definately have it again, and recommend giving it a try if you can find a bottle, but feel that there are other beers out there just as good or better for half the price. 1,447 characterstaez555, Jun 18, 2003

4.46/5  rDev -3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I held a special party for this one. I invited 3 friends and Hotstuff to join me in a little Westy 12 sampling party. Two showed up and the third gets his sample tomorrow as well as 2 other co-workers. My Rating: This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles and a cloudy yeasty semi opaque dark brown beautiful body. The aroma was its weakest point as it was only a sweet mild malt aroma. I would have expected a stronger more pleasant aroma for a higher rating. It has a very complex flavor of roasted notes as well as spices and the taste that a high alcohol content brings to a great brew. It had a tingly mouth feel in its finish as well as an alcohol taste. This is truly a brew to sip and enjoy as long as you can make it last because you certainly can't get too many of these especially at $10 a bottle. This brew has to rate as one of the best beers available. It is truly a masterpiece! The high point of the tasting came from a younger gentleman who had never had a great beer before. He rated it as the best beer he had ever had. Who would have guessed! The low point of the evening was when the host offered up a couple of more beers after the Westy's. Sorry to say, he had Miller lights in the fridge! Gag! The friends rated the brew as 8-3-10-4-16 and 6-5-9-5-19 per the RateBeer rating system. They did truly enjoy the brew and stated that it was probably the best beer they had ever had. Go figure! 1,444 charactersTheDM, Jun 07, 2003
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Id been saving this one in the cellar for some time. A wet, cool, dreary June afternoon seemed like the perfect time to open the bottle.just the thing to warm and brighten the day.
Pours with considerable aromathe smells of alcohol and ripe fruit spring forth as soon as you open the bottle. The thick, blanket-like light-tan head produces considerable lace. Brown and murky color, with an awful lot of sediment. 
Phenols, Alcohol, and malt smells grow more intense as you work through the glass. The beer is intensely sweet foretaste, with a heavy, full, creamy mouthfeel (even the smallest sips seem to fill your mouth). Finish is spicy and peppery, with serious alcohol warming. 
This beer probably has more in common with a sweet, after-dinner port than any other brew. Its simply delicious.
Its not quite as complex as I was expecting, but its an outstanding, amazing beer. 894 charactersSuds, Jun 07, 2003
4.7/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My only Belgian glass for this is a Maudite, I assume that will do proper justice for any Belgian. The Westie12 pours a ruddy, muddy Brown with yeast floaties suspended throughout the brew. Not the most attractive beer you'll ever see, but the head is smooth and beautiful and actually feels good when it coats your top lip during the tasting.
The fluffy 2-finger head grudgingly gives way to about a half-finger and holds with excellent replenishment from below
Aroma is of raisins, shortbread cookies, something else is nipping at my nose, but I can't quite place it, blackstrap molasses?
Taste is wonderfully complex. Rum and chocolate, raisiny, fruity flavor. No doubt about the alcohol level, but criminy what a drink! Malty and solid feeling, but not overly heavy. A soft sweet finish leaves the mouth with traces of sugar and a mild touch of lingering hops.
The bubbles that feed the head might make you think this is a gassy beverage, but the carbonation is simply not that pronounced in the mouth. Elfen Belgian magic I suppose.
As it warms, I can sometimes pick up a peppery sensation towards the middle-back of the tongue. The sweet component begins to develop a licorice bend of sorts and I'm picking up other tastes, but either they are too faint or I'm taking too long to identify them. A very enjoyable beer well worth its rank & status. I may have to go down to Party Source and drain their supply. Thanks to SheepNutz for this bottle, I owe you a couple for this one, I feel like I just drank the taste equivalent of 3 beers. 1,557 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, Jun 01, 2003

Poured an attractive cola brown with a tight, fizzy head. There was a fair amount of sediment in the bottle, which was retained by leaving a bit of the beer unpoured. Aroma was rum soaked chocolate covered cherries. Flavor was mildly phenolic, the alcohol creeping in around the edges and a hint of burgundy wine. I kept expecting the flavor to go just a bit deeper, but it never developed, even as the beer warmed. Quite a good beer, but not head and shoulders above other good Belgians I've had. 718 charactersBrent, May 28, 2003
4.62/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The aroma of this beer is incredible, so thick it's like fog, and full of raisins, plums, and all manners of bright and sweet things. 
Appearance is also incredible. The color is milk chocolate brown, sort of like root beer with a bad attitude, with so much cloudy swirling sediment that you feel like you've captured a sandstorm at midnight. By the way, I was a bad boy and poured the whole beer into the glass, because I wanted to taste everything.
Mouthfeel was slightly thinner than expected -- this beer has been called chewy and I am not prepared to agree. Foamy is more like it. Malty, slightly burning. Very nice, just not as chewy as I had been led to expect.
Taste is a circus that changes as the beer warms, and like the aroma, is full of raisins and plums and chocolate and burning cocoa and a hundred other things that I could not catch before they ran down my tongue and into my belly.
Very drinkable! This beer was gone too quickly. In fact, this is one of the few beers that I would rather have in a larger size.
Definitely one of the best beers in the world, but I am not yet prepared to call it THE best in the world. I may have to try another. Yeah, that's it... that's what I have to do... I have to try another... for purely scientific reasons.
Certainly a beer that you have to try if you can. 1,333 charactersDarkale, May 27, 2003

Aroma:....requires a new vocabulary! Deep, and heady, rich, full of fruit, grapes, raisins, plums, and spices, a very complex blend, soft, but sensual, deliriously so, and delicious, and the more I breathe it in, the more the flavors become pronounced, more is revealed here, pepper, anise, rich mollasses, rum, sweetness compounded by rich dark flavors...
Now to drink...I...um...serious contemplation is required, for I am seriously, honestly, taken aback by the force of, not only the alcoholic content, but the strong, full, bewitching flavor of this incredible ale! It staggers the senses! Honestly, I reel from it's effects and must wait until my consciousness can comprehend what is going on...many layers, many flavors, many ways that this incredible concoction can impact upon the senses. 
I feel thoroughly slayed, laid waste, but utterly uplifted in my oblivion! Let the sword fall upon me more often, if the taste is as sweet!
Have I said heavenly already? No matter if I did, it's a truly transmogrific feeling, it is, and I could be in another galaxy, for all I care...fly me not to the moon, nor Jupiter, or the outer stars, but, merely wherever this impossibly exhilirating nectar may blossom...
Now that I have finally downed a simple sample of this much renowned ale, I can only say..."more, please!" 1,506 charactersfeloniousmonk, May 26, 2003
4.85/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A rare treat. Brought back from Sam's in Chicago by trbeer. The label is very spartan and doesn't advertise the mythical qualities of this beer. Enjoyed after a Rochefort 10. This is a special occasion - late night on a rare day off. I didn't quite get any special aroma until I inhaled deeply. At that point I got a whiff of grapes and bubble gum. Maybe this is unique. Beer in botle was mpale to dark brown with a two finger head. Flavor is of grapes, roasted caramel. A sip reveals fruitiness, followed by bitterness, alcohol taste, then fizz. Enjoying very late, 2AM, listening to some techno music. I'm enjoying this more than the Rochefort 10. A slight bit of hops bitterness in the beer which is nice along with the fruity taste. Drinkability is high - fairly light in body and not much stinging alcohol. Will I ever rate a perfect 5.0 beer? Let's see when I let the other bottle cellar for some time. 908 charactersmjohn27603, May 26, 2003
4.87/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I had this fabulous brew in a 11.2oz. bottle poured into a Belgian-style glass. It poured a deep brown with lots of yeast chunks and 1 finger of head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is absolutely awesome, sweet and roasted, very complex. The taste has everything, some chocolate, some fruit, sweetness of toffee maybe. I really believe that my palate is too immature to really understand the complexity of this beer. The mouthfeel is good and heavy. The drinkability is a little low due to the 11%, but this really is a world-class brew! 568 charactersSheepNutz, May 21, 2003

4.73/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5After much contemplation on whether this beer was worth trying based on its cost alone, I decided to splurge. Abt 12 pours a deep mahogany color with a creamy, off-white head. The head retains exceptionally well. Flecks of yeast sediment abound in the dark liquid. The smell is a bit port-like, with some sweet candy present in the aroma, as well. The taste is quite strong, with notes of candy sugar, dates, dark fruit, etc. all making equal impressions. A very well-balanced brew. Almost every sip is like a unique experience. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, albeit a little less carbonated than it could be. For a beer of 10.2% abv, this one drinks dangerously easy. Although maybe not worth the price for a single bottle, this is nonetheless an excellent creation from the Westvleteren Trappist brothers. Nectar, indeed. 829 charactersJon, May 17, 2003
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well, hell...if any beer deserves straight 5's, this beer does.
Alright...every other beer stand aside, you too Chimay Grande Reserve and Stone Imperial Stout, Westy 12 has captured me too. I will admit to being slightly skeptical about its reputation and fully expected to be let down, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. I must now spend every last waking moment seeking out this beer. Well, there goes my retirement income.
The beers appearance earned the lowest rating in my scorecard, but at 4.5, who can complain. Actually, I wish there was a 4.75 rating that I could have selected. The first pour was a dark copper in color with a controllable dense, khaki head. Some yeast floating here and there, but remarkably clear. Second pour included the bulk of the yeast sediment, and created a much darker, murky, brownish-amber color. Head creation was good on the second pour as well. The head stuck around and left substantial lace through the beer. The aroma is very aromatic. Smells of sweet toasted bread. The aroma is also quite yeasty, reminding me of a bakery. Hints of honey and caramel round out the smell. Tastes malty sweet. Loads of freshly baked bread and molasses, sweet fruit, caramel, chocolate (to a lesser degree), and toffee find there way into the taste spectrum. The alcohol taste is not blatantly apparent for a beer of 11%. Very viscous and chewy mouthfeel, and incredible smooth. Very easy to drink, with no edges left unsanded.
I don't see how any beer could get better than this. In fact, I may change my rating to a straight 5 later. Let me think it over a little. 1,612 charactersphilipt, May 09, 2003

It just edges out Rochefort 10 by a whisker, although I have never tasted them side-by-side. Don't drink this cold: let it warm up a bit to get the full effect of the aroma and flavors. Makes me consider moving to Belgium and becoming a monk! 303 charactersBoto, Apr 26, 2003
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer gods have smiled down upon this brewery. Absolutely the most satisfying beer that I have ever tasted. It pours a dark and murky brown with hints of red and an impressively large head that dies down quickly. The aroma reminded me of a barley wine with a lot of fruity scents and a hint of alcohol (I'm not a fan of Barley Wines, so I was hesitant). As I poured, the aroma strangely filled the air in the room making me aware of the aroma from about three feet away - first time for such a strong aroma. The flavor was incredibly complex. The flavor is so incredibly smooth that I was in shock (considering the strong aroma) I think I notice a hint of chocolate in the taste as well as some different fruits and a couple spices. The mouthfeel of this beer is extremely smooth and satisfying. I could drink this beer all night long - although I'd probably not last more than three because of the alcohol. Again, this is THE best beer I've ever had and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of the $8+ per bottle price. 1,028 charactersclvand0, Apr 22, 2003
4.5/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a slightly hazy chestnut, which becomes cloudy after pouring in the sediment. This beer has a terrific head, almost 2 fingers thick, with very good staying power. It leaves behind patches of lace as I drink.
The aroma is complex and alluring... chocolate, dates, some yeasty / musty notes, and a some rum like qualities. 
The flavor is just as complex, maybe even moreso, than the aroma. Begins with some sweet driet fruit notes, dates and figs, then I detect some chocolate, then some musty characteristics come out. The finish is spicey, with pepper and some light notes of alcohol.
The moutfeel is velvety smooth, and not as thick as I expected... it had a medium to full body. 
I could easily see myself drinking this again and again... and considering how easy this one is to drink, (and how strong it is,) that could be a very dangerous thing! 867 characterszerk, Apr 21, 2003

Dont drink this one too cold. I was a little impatient and the improvement was evident as I worked my way through the beer and it warmed from it's 44 degree storage temperature. 
Murky brown, dark caramel color. Evident sediment as it flowed into my glass. Sizable tan head that maintained well throughout the beer.
Aroma of sweet malt, raisins, alcohol, and ripe bananas.
Taste is complex. Sweet, roasted caramel malt is big up front. Raisin and ripe banana flavors come into play. Finishes well at first, but after a delay a bitterness creeps in.
Mouthfeel was heavy on the carbonation at first, but this waned as I drank the beer and it became very creamy and smooth. 
Drinkability is good. Alcohol is hardly noticed except for the post finish kick.
Overall, a very good beer. This style of beer is a change of pace for me which makes it a nice treat, but one Ill rarely shell out $10 for. 
A huge thank you to AKSmokedPorter for snagging the sample for me completely on his own whim after spotting it! Thats a great beer advocate and a great friend! 1,173 charactersPhantomVodoo, Apr 17, 2003
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A most difficult decision faces me: Which beer to review for #100? I had quite a selection to choose from, but I felt this undefinable urge to try this amazing beer. The minutes I let it sit to warm were some of the longest minutes of my life. Patience certainly rewarded me.
Appearance: Poured a deep, dark, and rich-looking dark amber color. Incredibly cloudy with all sorts of sediments suspended in mid-beer. Tiny bubbles compose a thin layer of head. Lacing is excellent.
Smell: I can almost see the vapors rising from the glass. All sorts of lovely aromas can be detected: fresh honey, raisins, sweet caramel, apple pie, and a hint of alchol envelope your olfactories.
Taste: The appearance and smell are merely the appetizer for the subsequent taste. Where to begin? Is "perfection in a bottle" acceptable? Quite simply the best beer I've had to date. A veritable circus of flavors parade and dance across your palate. Just when one seems to fade, another steps up to offer itself to your taste buds. A myriad of fruit flavors abound, with honey and caramel lending their flavors to the profile. A prevailing sweetness is the backbone of this beer, but is so lovingly meshed with all of the other flavors that you wonder where it begins and ends. Only near the end do you feel the slight warming effect of the alcohol. I am amazed that this is an 11.0% ABV beer. It certainly hides the alcohol content well.
Mouthfeel: I felt like I could take a knife and fork and cut this beer. The mouthfeel is so "chewy"! It's as if each taste bud has been soaked in flavor, drenched in this ambrosia-like concoction that effortlessly makes its way into your mouth.
Drinkability: Simply fantastic. An incredibly easy to drink beer, even with the high alcohol content. It got even better as it warmed. Finish was on the dry side, which was another pleasant surprise. It took quite some time to finish this, and I savored every last drop. Even after swallowing, there are flavors that show up, demanding you sit up and take notice. I know began to feel an appreciation for what is contained within the bottle.
Please...I beg of you to seek out this beer. It is an experience you'll not soon forget. The combination of aromas and flavors weave such an impressive tapestry of complexity that you must try it and see what you think.
A mighty thanks to fellow BA AKSmokedPorter for acquiring one of these for me.
A truly worthy beer for my 100th review and a truly amazing beer to be tasted. 2,504 charactersOldFrothingSlosh, Apr 10, 2003

Smell: Red wine aroma mixed with spices. Alcohol presence also detected. 
Taste: Fruity plums and grape like flavor followed by very sweet malt and spiciness. Also detected roasted pears. Finished with strong hop bitterness and alcohol warmth.
Mouthfeel: Creamy and dry.
Drinkability: Moderately drinkable but limited by the ABV presence.
Comments: Flavors were very well blended together. The flavors however did not emerge slowly in sequence but came all at once. I enjoyed the beer, but there are others I like better that have (at least from what I perceive) a more multi-dimensional flavor profile. 707 charactersDenali, Mar 24, 2003
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The pour gave this brown, murky, ugly beer a nice chunky, off-white head which quickly melted into a thin, lacing layer. The great charm about the appearance of this beer is the fact that the CEOs of the macro producers would find this to be the farthest thing from acceptable. Looking like swamp water with a few sediment chunks, it must be completely repulsive to a drinker of crystal clear, yellow beer. It is an offensive thing of beauty. 
It had a very pleasant aroma that can only be described as smooth. It was slightly dusty with heft, nostril filling doses of cookie dough, milk chocolate, and something reminiscent of the flavor of browned saltines. Stunning nose, simply stunning.
While its appearance is lovable like a retarded kitten, and its aroma is unforgettable, the taste of the beer is hefty, but in an elegant sort of way. Its not delicate like a fine pils, but its beauty is in its strength. Sweetness and unadulterated malt immediately fill the mouth, and after swallowing yeasty bread lingers for some time playing with ripe fruit and the flavors fade. A very complex brew, but simple in that nothing is hidden, only meticulously layered. The alcohol wasnt a huge factor in this beer, but it wouldnt be the same without the same with out the unmistakable warming of the gullet. 
It was silky in the mouth, carbonation perfect. This was a truly great beer. 1,399 charactersyen157, Mar 21, 2003
4.3/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I paid $11.39 for 11.2 oz of this stuff, and I have to question whether the expectation this price creates might be affecting ratings of the beer. Don't get me wrong, it's quite good. The pour is dark ruby with a thin, light tan head. Lots of sediment though, even when I tried to pour carefully. Aroma is slightly sweet, with hints of plum and a nutty character. Beer has a smooth body with a light, fruity malt flavor and what struck me as a very noticeable alcohol character. Malt takes on a slightly toasty character mid-palate, with hints of toffee, and the beer finishes with an earthy/herbal, and very well-blended hop flavor. Finish is slightly sugary, and very lightly dry. Good stuff, and well worth trying, but other examples of the style (Abbaye des Rocs comes to mind) provide a much better bang for the buck. 822 charactersmzwolinski, Feb 24, 2003
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well...just when I thought nothing could ever dethrone Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout as my favorite beer in the entire world...it's happened. No disrespect to SSOS, but holy christmas! I can only say if you have not yet sampled this brew, seek until ye find, pay whatever ye must, and sit down with this bad boy.
It appeared before me in the goblet as a muddy light brown brew, with a pretty decent head that retained very well. The smell was wonderful at the start, and only got better and more powerful as it warmed. The initial aroma is quite sweet, mostly of yeast and cherries. After a while, I started to pick up darker fruits, plums, and maybe some very light chocolate (?). I thought so. All the while though, the initial sweet smells came through at the same time. 
This is by far one of the most complex brews in the world. Flavors of just about everything hit, layer after layer. Sweet flavors initially, then some dark fruitiness, raisins, rum, spicy clove...and then the warm alcohol finish. This is absolutely delicious. 
The mouthfeel is pure perfection and probably could not be better. It's indescribable...silky smooth. You would have to try this beer to understand. If you haven't I suggest getting it on your short list, and then attempting to find it very soon. This is a legitimate #1, and as of yet, I have not had a better beer.
Thanks to ElGuapo for so generously giving me a bottle of this wonderful brew, when I randomly showed up at his apartment. 1,484 charactersIrishRedRock, Feb 20, 2003

Alcohol, alcohol, and more alcohol in the nose underscored by a grainy, malty smell.
Buttery, silky, velvety texture... smooth and cold on the tongue. Tastes of alcohol, pine trees, bread, toffee... Shit -- this beer is so rich and flavorful, I'm surprised there's not pizza flavoring in there. Alcohol and pine taste turns to chocolate and caramel as the beverage sits.
This beer changes dramatically over time. The somewhat dry, crisp finish turns to a more flavorful, lingering aftertaste over time.
You could write a friggin book of poetry on this beer. 772 charactersmarburg, Feb 19, 2003

No single flavor jumps out at me. There is some major complexity in there while staying somewhat mellow all around. It's a warm kind of mellow, a fruity mellow. The alcohol is a little bit noticeable, pretty much warm really. Body is medium and there is a moderate carbonation feel. This is definitely the best Belgian ale I have had to date. I can't say it's the best beer overall, because I have so many yet to try. Anyone who is a broke college student like myself.....well you should still come up with $8 for a bottle of this. You won't regret it. 651 charactersAudioGilz, Feb 18, 2003

This ale pours with a silky, creamy beige head sitting on top of beautifil toffee brown body. Belgian lace in the glass as you drink this offering is evidence of the excellent head reteniton. The nose is very malty with hints of prunes and toffee. The taste...ahhh...the taste! The taste is robustly malty with hints of raisin, caramel, toffee and chocolate. Take your time enjoying Yellow Cap because these flavors develop as the beer warms in your hand. Overall, the taste is sweetly malty with an excellent background of clove spiciness. The warming alcohol sensation only adds to the character of this ale. The finish is dry with a pleasant caramel aftertaste. a well balanced and well crafted ale. A must add to any true beer lover's collection! 856 charactersmaltydog, Feb 13, 2003

When you taste something like this, you gotta feel bad for the Southern Baptist down here, becuase they either A) Can't drink alcohol or B) Can drink it, but can't tell anyone. This is proof that it is great to be a Catholic. At least something good has come from it lately. Anyways, the beer is a cloudy brown color and had a light brown head for a little bit. It's smell is that of various fruits and nuts. You can taste a hint of alcohol, but it smooths out quickly. The aftertaste is very smooth and also tastes quite fruity. I could drink this all day and night, but it's kinda on the high side for price. I guess that's the only drawback for it though. Aside from the price, all the combinations that are put into this beer, truely make this beer a heavenly experience. Praise be to God in the Highest! 895 charactersJISurfer, Feb 03, 2003
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5One of the best beers in the world! This fresh sample came to me directly from belgium via belgianshop.com(thanx!:-) Anyway, this beer poured a very dark cloudy, amber-ish brown. I was pouring this into my genuine Trappist Westvleteren glass and before I knew it the whole bottle was in the chalice yeast and all...Oh Well! This beer had a nice appearance that was a bit cloudy and yeasty(since I poured all the floaties in there...)but it still looked very nice. This smelled of fruity alcohol esters, chewy roasted and chocolate-y malts as well as raisins, figs, plums and you name it! This tasted heavenly, and seemed to be a perfect blend of all of the above mentioned flavors. It sure is amazing what westvleteren can do with very few simple ingredients! This beer had one of the best mouthfeels ever! It was extremely thick and velvetty and rolled down my throat oh so smoothly! I have to tag the drinkability factor by .5 just for the alcoholic flavors and the very high abv %
This is a damn fine amazing beer and possibly 1 that is deserving of the #1 spot on BA if you ask me. although I have only had all of the beers from 3 of 6 trappist breweries in Belgium. For me Westvleteren is easily the best of the 3(orval, chimay and westie)!

This beer is outstanding. It was a bit dark down there, so I have to say that it poured a dark robust color. I don't remember the smell as being overwhelming, let's say it didn't prepare me for such a wonderful taste. This beer is among the smoothest I have ever had. I can't get over how some high alcohol beers let you know right off from the smell that they are going to make you know they have alcohol in them. This beer may have a high alcohol content, but I did not pick up an overwhelming alcoholic taste. A beer that can do that, I really respect. The taste was, oh I almost can't describe, but it was smooth as silk, and made you say this is a beer to savor. I gave the mouthfeel a 4.5, and the drinkability only a 4, out of respect for the alcohol content.
I would highly recommend this to anyone. 982 charactersPatandDavid, Jan 26, 2003

This beer poured a very dark cloudy amber color and formed a light tan foamy head that disappeared quickly leaving some circular lace. An aroma of alcohol, raisins and yeast/grains. A flavor of malt, caramel and raisin with some elements of spices. The finish is creamy and a touch sweet with elements of the alcohol. A very great belgian beer, but will need to try some others to see if this is really the best out there. 509 charactersWildman, Jan 25, 2003

Murky brown pour, lots of sediment swirling about in the glass. Thick, medium lasting tan head, huge clingy bubbles initially formed on the side of the glass, then burped their way to the top, never to be seen again. Aroma filled the room with strong apple scents, with some yeast and doughy aroma coming with a more intimate sniff. Taste is strongly doughy and apple, with hints of banana, grape, plum and strong malty sweetness in there. The banana seems to come through more as it gets warmer. Slight alcohol comes through towards the end. Mouthfeel is huge, pummeling the palate with all the different luxurious flavors, feelings, and hints of alcohol. 694 charactersgoz, Jan 16, 2003

The taste reveals a very creamy medium bodied mouthfeel that consists of raisons, fruit, spices, light yeast, and alcohol. It finishes with a lightly sweet aftertaste that leaves you wanting more.

The colour is the same dark brown (monk's habit). The head is huge, tan, with persistent lace on the glass. The smell is more wide and variegated, with point of floral well delineated. White grape. The taste is delicate, creamy, velveted and soft, with continuity in the sweet. Finish more bitter, but not too bitter. The body is full, round, persistent and durable, for a very long time. The aftertaste is also persistent.

4.18/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4This bottle gushed upon opening, and was furiously overcarbonated. Upon pouring, the brew forms an off white head that slowly settles into a tight, well retained thin layer. Muddy, murky dark brown hue, w/ flowing aggregrates of yeast liberated from the gushing. Musty yeast, and dry, bittersweet dark chocolate upfront in aroma. As the beer breathes fruity esters of both banana and raisins emerge simultaneously with deeply caramelized sugar and mellow chocolate. Hints of cardboard from oxidation unfortunately dulls the aroma a bit. Chewy, molasses - like, heavily caramelized dark candi sugar sweetness hits the tongue at first. Sweetness then becomes dark fruit like in nature and when coupled with the mellow chocolate undertone, I am left with an impression of chocolate covered dates. Banana esters then surface along with yeast must, lending a perhaps overripe banana flavor mid palate. Hop bitterness is virtually absent, leaving an overall richly sweet profile to this brew. A true dessert in a beer! Full in body, w/ a sugary, slightly syrupy viscous mouthfeel that is appropriate considering the high strength and richness. Finishes caramelly sweet, offset by dull notes of oxidation. Alcohol warmth emerges dangerously late. Although it is clear that my bottle didn't travel well, 12 is complex and robust enough to prevent the oxidation from affecting the overall aroma and rich flavor profile significantly. Delicious! I will search out another bottle for another taste. 1,487 charactersmarc77, Nov 24, 2002

Has a dark brown color, nearly opaque, with some yeasty bits hovering throughout, even with a fairly slow pour. Head was quite fine, and thinned down quickly, and managed to leave some lace.
 First whiff knocked me back a bit with a "whoa!". A big dose of dark fruit notes and alcohol hit me between the eyes.
 Extremely smooth on the tongue....velvety almost. And the body was medium-plus overall. 
First sip had me throwing out another "whoa!". Malty, sweet flavors combine with some excellent dark fruitiness to create a luscious combo for the palate. And I can also feel a pleasant warming inside from the alcohol. I'm giving it a drinkability of 5 not because it's something I'd drink a lot of, but because I would NOT turn one down at any time if offered. This one's a big-time keeper! I'm very happy with this choice for #400! Zum Wohl!!

4.88/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5One of the best dark Belgian beers I've had yet. It was perfect pour into a Westvleteren goblet with the head rising to the top of the glass when I had poured all but the last ounce leaving the yeast behind. The head dissapated to about a quarter inch and lasted to the end. Its heavenly dark malty body is offset perfectly by the tannish head. Smell is somewhat weathish with a slight tinge of bananas and chocolate. Went down smooth and creamy with chocolate, caramel, and fruity flavors of bananas and dates. First few sips were somewhat crisp and dry but as you drank more, it became sweeter but not overly sweet and the fine alcohol flavors became more pronounced. Had a nice floral hop flavor and there wasn't much bitterness, just enough dryness from the hops and alcohol to balance the sweet malt. As close as you can get to perfection in the style. 857 charactersLongstaff, Oct 10, 2002
4.65/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I didn't know what to expect with this brew after receiving it (thanks to a trade from a gentleman in NYC!) and reading many reviews of it. I think it was a little too cold when I tried it, as the taste got noticeably better as I moved through the glass. Now about the taste, I honestly don't think my palate is refined enough to describe accurately what is going on here. This will be one I have to try again around beer #250 I think. There is a trail mix aroma, and the flavor is hard to pin down. If they captured this flavor in a cereal I would get up earlier every day, hints of berries, grain, nuts, chocolate. Like Willy Wonka invented it, I tasted something different with every sip. I think this would be a perfect drink with some Godiva chocolate covered strawberries. Superb! 786 charactersDogbrick, Sep 10, 2002
4.1/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours out to a dark, almost purple color in the glass with minimal head. Taste is that of a spiced fruit. Very wine-like in character and finish. Reminiscent of brandy as well. Enjoyable, but my palate didn't find it to be the best beer in the world. 250 charactersproc, Sep 03, 2002
5/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I hate giving a beer a straight 5, but it is so hard to find fault with this beer. A strong, robust, vinuous beer in the style of an English Barley Wine mixed with all of the Trappist skill of a Belgium Strong Ale.
Dark, with hefty doses of everything from Toffee, Raisins, Cadburys Bourneville Dark Chocolate, Dundee Cake, Caramel, etc. Need I go on? Keeps its head well. Malt dominant and a meal in its own right. Best drunk from a proper Westvleteren Goblet emblazoned with those immortal words in yellow.
Even better when drunk in the unofficial Westvleteren Brewery Tap, the Café In De Vrede opposite the Abbey. Dangerously drinkable for an 11% ABV beer.
There must be something to fault right ?? Well, at the risk of damnation from the Monks - its Bloody impossible to get your hands on it in the US, and you can't down-mark it for that.
Probably the Best Beer in the World. 889 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Aug 21, 2002
4.56/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Very dark. The color of a raisin, black except at the right angle when it turns a deep mahogany brown. Light khaki head is a creamy foam that is long-lasting. Laces the glass well. Yeasty caramel on the nose. The taste is vaguely stout-like. The richness of the flavor is very nice but not too rich to make it hard to drink. Caramel, spicy yeast and wood come out first. As it warms, more coffeeish flavor and some lactic characteristics. The beer manages to be slightly creamy and bright on the palate at the same time. Amazingly easy drinking for its strength. 562 charactersaracauna, Aug 08, 2002
4.75/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Yummmmm! This beer was one of the tastest brews I have ever had. I like Jason's Buckwheat honey aroma comment, very true. It's spicy, fruity, malty, chocolaty flavor, smooth texture and wonderful aroma, there are few that rival this beer. I had one last night as desert and had it with a chocolate macaroon, absolute perfection. 328 charactersmattmaples, Jun 10, 2002
4.25/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Presentation: 11.2 oz slender brown bottle, no freshness code and no label.
Appearance: Silky looking off white lace, very tiny bubble dropping rings around the glass.
Smell: Very aromatic. Suggestions of plump golden raisins, anise, herbal tea, buckwheat honey, caramel, lemon rind, fresh baked short bread and a mild phenolic character. Sweet and spicy alcohol in the nose with a mellow malt.
Taste: Luscious velvety mouth feel, medium carbonation that fuels the viscosity of the smoothness and body. Big maltiness is pushed around by a flailing spicy character, bit of clove with a mellow medicinal phenol also. Malt is sweet and has flavours of brown bread and caramel but Christmas pudding also with alcohol and candied fruit. Alcohol is very prevalent but not overwhelming, adds a sweet and spicy presence and a warming effect. Hints of raw honey, anise and lemon zest. Touch of yeast adds the element of earth to the complex mix, esters grow more towards the end with an addition of ghost like fusel alcohol. Semi-dry finish with lingering spicy and phenolic flavours.
Notes: So damn smooth, near perfection in a bottle. The alcohol at its strength does not bring down the drinkability and makes this beer so balanced in a heavenly way that it is devious for making you want more and more. 1,300 charactersJason, Mar 16, 2002
4.97/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Heavenly.  I took my reviewing cap off for this one and just simply enjoyed so I don't have a lot of descriptives here, but I recall a dominant fruit that I couldn't quite pinpoint (figs?) and an overall sweetish finish (maybe the heavy use of dark candi sugar).  As a treat every now and again, it's worth every penny. 319 characterspbrian, Mar 12, 2002
