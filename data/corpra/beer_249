A- Pours a hazy light amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of sheer surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves a thick, solid ring behind.
S- Moderate aromas of Brett funk and peach skin.
T- Brett in the forefront with some mild peach coming through mid-palate and finishing tart.  Very refreshing and drinkable with the three different elements combining in a way that's very well-integrated.  Also, the dryness of the Brett plays well with the sweetness of the peach.  Definitely has a cleaner Brett character to it.  Oh and I almost forgot to mention there's almost no trace to be found of the 10% ABV.  So smooth.
M- A soft creaminess that's contrasted by the tartness.  Medium carbonation and a lightish body.
O- Very well done.  Glad I finally got a chance to try this one.  Everything just fits together so seamlessly.  Highly recommended. 1,008 charactersImmortale25, May 10, 2017

The brett is well done and not overpowering, but I found myself wanting more fresh peach out of it.  It's there on the nose, but not enough for me in the taste.  I had it on tap in Eugene, so I'm not sure when it was brewed, but I assume fairly recently.  I doubt the peach has mellowed with age, I just think that's what Logsdon was going for.  The alcohol is certainly well hidden.  Perhaps I'll give it another shot and revised as warranted.  For me, good but not great. 533 charactersandy712, Apr 20, 2017

Taste, wow, nice and light bodied, yet delivering a substantial amount of brett dryness, funk, oak and peaches.  Easy to see why this is so appreciated.   Alternates between creamy peach and dry saison body mouthfeel.  
How does it hide that big abv?  Amazingly done.  Everything blends together well without any aspect dominating.  Does everything well, carbonation spot on.

'
10% ABV. "Oak aged organic ale brewed with peaches." Brewed with peaches and brettanomyces. "Final refermentation with pear juice."
Expectations are extremely high given my love for the brewery and this beer's presence on the top 250 beers list.
HEAD: ~3 fingers worth of white head. Frothy, creamy, gorgeously soft, and of great complexion. Consistency is terrific. Retention is excellent - ~8+ minutes.
BODY: Pale murky orange of okay vibrance. I see no yeast or sediment within, but it definitely appears unfiltered.
Appears well-carbonated. It's a nice looking beer and captures the lively unfiltered look of a great saison, but I can't say the vibrance of the body colour is on par with that of the best expressions of the style.
AROMA: Soft orchard peaches, orange sherbert, soft juicy pear, creamy notes, pale malts. The soft luscious peach is impeccable, elevating this aroma easily to world class level. Promises a juicy peachy genuine brew with absurd depth and expressiveness of flavour.
Any oak is too subdued to be noticeable. Sweetness/bitterness balance seems perfect. Nectary juicy goodness is the highlight of this aroma; I'm salivating just awaiting the first sip.
Aromatic intensity is perfect (mild to moderate).
No overt hop notes; maybe some seamless fruity tones. Yeast character has an incredibly subtle funky bend without distracting. As soft and delicate an aroma as they come.
No off-notes or overt alcohol.
TASTE & TEXTURE: Creamy soft peach, smacky lactic tartness (was the brettanomyces used lambicus? This is straight-up sour), evocative expressive orchard peach, soft juicy luscious pear, subtle yeasty dryness (bringing just enough to coax more depth of flavour out of this brew without making it drag on the palate), and creamy peach sherbert.
Hides its 10% ABV angelically well, hiding any alcohol beneath layers of billowing softness. Couldn't be more delicate or gentle on the palate. Perfectly smacky on the palate, making the slight tart sourness sing. Comfortingly soft. This mouthfeel may be perfect; rarely do I encounter such harmony of softness, fragility, and body. It's so light it's insanely drinkable, it's aptly smooth and wet, and carbonation is perfect.
Malt backbone melts into the dominant fruity tones, letting them take the spotlight. This is as gestalt a flavour profile as I've ever encountered, blending every constituent note together in a layered cohesive way, elevating the whole above the sum of its parts. The peach sings. 
Noticeable acidity.
Sourness is maybe a 4/10, which is ideal for a saison in my view. It lacks any drying funkiness, and there aren't too many fruity esters mucking with the fruity focus of the brew. Balance is perfect. Depth of flavour is excellent. Duration of flavour is high for the style. Intensity of flavour is moderate. I can't get enough of this stuff.
OVERALL: Logsdon outdoes themselves with this stellar brew. This is possibly the best saison I've had from any brewery in North America, and I can't vet its quality enough. It's earned its position on the current top 250 list, and I'd heartily recommend it to any discerning drinker - even at its seemingly obscene $40/bottle price. When I think of true perfection in terms of texture, this beer will be amongst the first to pop into my head. Its juicy softness accentuates the peach emphasis of the brew beautifully. Awingly good - ineffably so. Just fuckingly delicious. I find myself inhaling this and simultaneously being shocked by its 10% - how is this so effortlessly drinkable at that high an ABV?
Nitpicky as I am with great beers, I have to admit I struggle to find many issues with this aside from petty things like appearance. At a certain point, excellence becomes undeniable.
This is what we talk about when we talk about beer as art.

Taste is much the same. The peach is present but doesn't dominate, and the Brett plays a quiet supporting role (maybe too quiet) adding some straw, loan and earthy nut. The oak lends a bit of a hot ending, and I'm not sure I loved the sweeter peach notes marriage to the heavy rustic notes. That said, it is a very strong beer with unique flavor combinations and is definitely worth a try 590 charactersajm5108, Aug 22, 2016

4.49/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Gotta listen to the bottle for this gem - let it warm up before enjoying. The flavor profile really opens up and makes the experience something special. Aroma is peach. So much peach! There's a hint of lavendar on the nose followed by muscular oak and that funky brett. Taste is fresh peach, tart peach, oak and brett that finishes with a touch of apricot. The lacing is pourus and sticky and leaves behind a webbed trail down the glass. Finishes dry and with a lingering tartness that puckers the cheek but doesn't overpower. Awesome beer. 540 charactersManapuaMan, Aug 12, 2016

2.96/5  rDev -32.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 2.5Yields a clouded amber-yellow color with a decent sized head. 
Lots of ripe, almost overripe peaches on the nose with an earthy quality and ice-tea sweet malts. A faint, funky, dusty sourness cuts through the prominent fruitiness, which reveals a luscious sweetness, reminding me of a peach jogurt.
Has a medium carbonation among a fuller body with a late dryness, coating up the sourness. 
Drinks with a heavy, fermented fruitiness from the very beginning, complimented by sweet, cakey malts and a creamy softness. Has a jogurty sourness, which gets accompanied by a perfumy peach fruitiness throughout. Finish with more acidic jogurt, still soft on the tongue with even more perfumy peach.
Seems a bit unbalanced to me due to the overly artificial, perfume dominance, which is pretty intense on both aromas and flavors. Got a nice, well fitting tartness, which adds to the richness of the peaches. Unfortunately its pushing too far, adding a distractive artifical flavor to the taste. 990 charactersaleigator, Jul 16, 2016

I enjoyed this on the same night as Fuzzy, and this was definitely the better peach beer.  Cheers Logsdon! 294 charactersLochnessmonster, Jun 26, 2016

Bottle No. 20430
Best by: 10/2020
Served in a tulip
Beautiful appearance. The hazy, golden-amber liquid was capped by a billowing, four-finger tall, bright white, fluffy mass. Large clumps of Brussels-style lacing cascaded down the glass. The head slowly dropped to a thick, frothy film.
The aroma was somewhat underwhelming. A super crisp, dry, powdery yeasty quality was balanced by subtle peach notes. Bright and lively. Slightly floral. A bit jasmine tea-like. The nose was also moderately tart and brett-y. Slightly funky. As the beer sat, the peach subsided and the yeastiness intensified. Dry, tannic, oaky notes also came through big time. Later, the peach reappeared.
The flavor profile was super dry and tannic. Fairly bitter as well. There was a subtle fruity quality on the front end and a touch of malty sweetness, but this was quickly washed away by tart, brett-y notes and a crisp, dry, powdery yeastiness. The beer was also really oaky and tannic. Lemon rind appeared on the back end and carried into the finish. Moderately bitter with a hint of earthy, aged hops. The oaky barrel notes again came through strong. Super tannic and dry. Almost a bit astringent. As the beer sat, subtle fruity notes appeared. Though the flavor profile was rather unrefined, the alcohol was barely noticeable.
The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Soft and creamy. This almost seemed a bit undercarbonated. The liquid contained a fine, frothy effervescence that tuned smooth and supple on the palate.
I really enjoyed Logsdon's Seizoen Bretta and Oak Aged Bretta but found this beer to be overly dry, tannic and one-dimensional. Even though I opened this bottle only a few months after cellaring it, the peach was hardly noticeable. Looking at many of the reviews here on BA, my only guess would be that this was stored for a while before being distributed. That said, I would love to revisit a fresher bottle someday. 2,017 charactersDamian, Feb 09, 2016

S: The second best peach smelling beer to VSP. Holy hell, it just hits you in the face with fresh peach skins with a touch of funk and a little oak, but mostly a huge peach bomb. T: Nice peach with some funk and oak dryness on the back. The taste isn't as peach heavy as the smell, but still very nice. M: Has the nice creamy mouthfeel that helps with the lacto that you feel more than you taste. O: I was really pumped to try this and it was very good. It's not as good as VSP, but it's a solid beer 587 charactersAMCimpi, Jan 24, 2016

Aroma of light tart notes with funky yeast notes and fresh peach notes is quite awesome. Taste is a great mix between some peach notes with loads of tart notes with light acidic flavours and some funky yeast notes also noticeable. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Best peach beer I have ever had with lots of dominating flavours and nice balance between the funky and tart flavours. 527 charactersPhyl21ca, Jan 22, 2016

Bit of brett funk on the nose and lots of peaches.  Wouldn't characterize this as "funky" per se, moree sour fruitiness,
Great noticeable peach, refreshing sour note.  Reminds me a lot of Allagash Farm to Face
High carbonation the between this and the aciditity, I think the other reviewers referencing champagne are accurate. 383 charactersZonk, Jan 19, 2016

Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for this whale
A: Medium orange, with some tangerine and honey around the edges - hazy, but not murky - pours with a medium-large, fluffy, creamy, off-white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves streaks and spots of lacing
S: Funky peach soda - bursting with peach in every way - ripe peach flesh, peach juice - Logsdon's lovely saison yeast aromas, with some yeasty funk and spice, green apple esters - tart, funky peaches - some hints of citrus, mainly orange and lemon - straight-up Brett, with some powdery funk, cherry skins - nice amount of oak, ripe and woody without being overbearing - some pale malts and wheat at the base with some crackers and light biscuits
T: Juicy peach madness - peaches really stand out about as much as one would expect, with loads of ripe, juicy peach flesh - tart and lightly funky peaches as well - saison yeast funk, with some spice - funky tartness with a touch of sour - lightly earthy but also bright and clean - citrus, grapefruit zest and some lemon - powdery Brett funk with some cherry skins - chewy, damp, musty oak - pale grains, crackers, light biscuits - overall, remarkably juicy and fruity
M: On the heavy side of medium, very smooth, almost creamy, carbonation on the low side, mostly clean, dry finish
O: Movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches
Well, this lives up to my personal hype. It quite literally tastes like Seizoen Bretta blended with peach juice. The amount of fruit in this is insane, without actually just tasting like a peach soda. This is well worth the search. 1,586 charactersangrybabboon, Dec 28, 2015
4.39/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Split with angrybabboon.
Appearance: Hazy bright golden orange. Head is bright-white and creamy with an initial dense and fluffy cap. Drops to a small wisp of a cap with sticky sheets and notches of lacing. Moderate carbonation on the pour. Super bright.
Smell: Straight up peach juice. Obliterated and macerated peach puree. Hyper fresh and fruity. Carries a deep funkiness throughout with big pushes of grass, dirt, and old wooden beams. Slightly musty with a soft lactic element building through the back. A touch of soap. Some tangerine and super soft malt. Some cracker and biscuity white bread. A touch of honey as well.
Taste: Funky tart peaches. Hay and grass mixed with a damp musty peach of wood slathered in peach puree. Mild lactic acidity brightens it up with each sip. Hints at nectarine and maybe even tangerine. Warming lets out a little wild honey character with a soft floral backing. Fluffy yeast with peach flesh. All of the peach. The finish comes off with a touch of soap and lingering woody bitterness. A solid push of pale malt. Slight biscuity malt sweetness rounds the whole thing out. Super ripe peach on the initial sip. Super deep brett character. Old barn and stone supports. Funky Tart edge builds a little as it warms hinting at something almost citric but falls back to lactic before getting there. Ever so slightly bandaidy.
Mouthfeel: The initial sip carries a medium body with a moderate carbonation. Finishes impressively dry given the juicy peach character. Moderate to high astringency.
Overall: When peach fuzz is made of bacteria.
The name is the most apt description I've read in forever. It's all peaches and brett. The brett runs the gamut and starts throwing some deep earth notes. It's solid, amazing even, but didn't quite match my expectations (damn you hype machine). 1,822 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Dec 28, 2015

You can smell it as soon as you pop open the bottle.  Also a bit of funk in there.  Sweet smelling.  The taste is like the nose, but not as extreme.  A nice subtle peach flavor, with a nice tart finish.  Not overly tart though.  A nice bit of farmhouse funk in there also.  Overall, a super solid beer.

Sweet maltiness as well as a rustic funk from the Brett. The Brett character matches the peachy flavors very well. I am actually pleased to find that this one is not a super sour brew. Very peachy, Bretty, and authentic. The alcohol is hidden in with preposterous efficiency. I would like to experience more oak flavor. Overall I enjoyed this and thought it was nearly worth the hefty price tag. 653 charactersVelvetExtract, Dec 19, 2015

Smell - Wow! This smells like fresh peaches. Very nice!
Taste - My initial impression is tart fresh peaches. The funk enters with a certain level of grassiness. Toward the back, the taste leans dry from the oak with hints of sour Granny Smith apples. 
Mouthfeel - The carbonation is aggressive, brushing away the sweetnees until only dry notes are left. 
Overall - The peaches here are great. I am not a big saison guy, but this is great. 522 charactersJohnnyHopps, Dec 13, 2015

4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A — Pours an orangey hazy color into the glass, there is a puffy white head that settles out and leaves a spot or two of lacing behind.
S — Smells of fresh peaches and light funky brett. Really peach forward and fresh, just ridiculous how fresh and juicy this smells.
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a one and a half finger big fluffy white head. After it finally dissipated (boy that took forever, almost like watching paint dry), light messy lacing stuck all around the glass.
The smell started off with sweet juicy peaches. Funky brett plays a nice balance to lead into light tart citrus underneath.
The taste was basically the same bringing in a nice sour element for added complexity. Subtle yeastiness shows its presence nicely. Semi-sweet to sour aftertaste runs into the finish.
The mouthfeel was about light to medium bodied with a really nice crisp sweet sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good. Sour notes hit my tongue nicely.
Overall, what a wonderful saison with the sour and tart feels in it. I'd have this again. This is top notch stuff here. 1,119 charactersSitkaSteve, Oct 28, 2015

Very cloudy tall white head but just huge aromas of sour peach and like a blue cheese funk. Taste was baby food. Tart peach baby food is the only way I can really describe this one. Loved it. 286 characterscarrionricardo, Oct 21, 2015

A — Pours an orangey hazy color into the glass, there is a puffy white head that settles out and leaves a spot or two of lacing behind.
S — Smells of fresh peaches and light funky brett. Really peach forward and fresh, just ridiculous how fresh and juicy this smells.
T — Tastes lightly sweet and super juicy, little bit of a funky brett balance as well, yeasty, lightly phenolic.
M — Medium bodied, little to no alcohol presence, can't believe this is 10.0% ABV, just super refreshing and light.
O — Fantastic overall, errs on the sweet side, I would love this with a little bit of sour, but as it is, it's freaking great. 682 charactersMoose90, Sep 22, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Purchased at Costco for $15.59.  750 ml bottles dated "Best By 1/2020".  Poured into tulips and shared with good friends around a campfire on a warm summer evening.  
Pours a gorgeous creamy pastel peach color with a thick, frothy head that sticks around and leaves tons of lace.
Aroma is almost straight-up peach, with just a hint of brett.  Very fruity aroma.
Taste is also dominated by fresh and fruity peach, but with enough tartness to add complexity and just a slight aftertaste of straw and horse.  No indication here of the high ABV.
Mouth is perfect.  Creamy, smooth, silky, slightly dry, but enough fruit to fill your mouth. 
Overall, this is a great fruit beer that  builds on the already fantastic Soizen Bretta base beer.  I'm glad I got two bottles. 768 charactersFFreak, Aug 31, 2015

Pours a rich and glowing honey color with depth. Huge soapy head.
Aromas are unique combination of brett yeast and peach.
Taste is complex. The brett is tamped down by the peach but they mix to create something unique.
Moutfeel was very nice.
Overall this beer is unique, complex and delicious. Tons of fruit here. 361 charactersBoldRulerVT, Aug 30, 2015

The taste is really where this beer missed the mark. It delvers on the peach but less than the nose would indicate. I was hoping for more sour on the palate to strengthen this beer. The finish was bizarre and undesirable. 343 charactersrodmanfor3, Jun 14, 2015

There is very little sour and even tart qualities. A very overrrated beer that has decent qualities but very little peach flavor and is by no means a sour. I should have known after trying the saison brett by Logsdon. 
Overrated to say the least. Very unimpressed. The aftertaste has a mediocre lager taste I try to extinguish with the next sip. I hope you didn't sacrifice too much for this lil bro. 446 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, May 29, 2015

The flavor is very different as the beer offers pear juice, a touch of peach flavor, lots of intense metallic-like Brett flavor with a dry finish. 289 charactersdar482, Apr 28, 2015

Overall - I am not a saison guy, but to date, this is the best farmhouse ale I have had.  More than I expected.  This makes me want to dip into the saison/farmhouse ale department. 489 charactersmabermud, Apr 25, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752014 PnB poured from a 750 mL bottle I received in a trade with sonsofauerbach into a 12 oz North Coast tulip glass.
L: Delicious and juicy right on sight.  A fully opaque cloudiness in a beautiful orange that belies the peaches within this beer.  A rich and frothy head of many fingers on the pour that recedes into one finger of consistent head.
S: May be one of the best things about this beer, its almost floral at first.  Followed quickly be juicy peaches.  Followed at the end of brett mixed with oak.  I think some of the floralness is from the pear juice its refermented with.  Fantastic.
T: Tastes just like it smells (which if you saw above is obviously a good thing).  This bottle is a year old now, and maybe it hasn't developed fully, but I still get a lot of oak and brett and not so much peaches, thats why only a 4.75.  This beer is GREAT.  I just don't get the peaches that much so not the perfect score here.  Also, I do taste the 10% on this.
F:  Well done, as all Logsdon beers are, almost champagne like in many ways, maybe even prosecco with such fine carbonation.  It's light, yet sticks to the right parts of your palate and begs for another sip.
O:  I'm really happy with this beer.  I'd been chasing it for a month or so, and it certainly didn't disappoint.  Some reviews overplayed how peach tasting this would be, and for that it was a SLIGHT disappointment, but for what it was I am FAR from disappointed.  Will be looking for this years version when it comes out. 1,498 charactersSLubeski, Apr 17, 2015

Best By: 1/2020
Consumed: 4/11/15
A: 4.5 Quite a pretty beer; pours a slightly hazy, orange-gold. The two inch, off-white head lasts a couple minutes and leaves good lacing.
S: 4.5 Tons of peach. More fruit than I’ve smelled in just about any beer. Smells rather sweet with a lot of very ripe, candied peach. A very small amount of brett and funk comes through and a touch of white wine on the finish. 
T: 4.75 While the nose is dominated by peaches, the flavor is a bit more interesting and nuanced. Peach is still up front, but the brett really comes through here adding a nice, dryness to counter the relatively sweet peach. White wine, some herbs (thyme maybe?) and oak round out the finish with little bit of lingering bitterness.
M: 4.5 Great body and carbonation and rather dry. Super refreshing for 10% abv.
O: 4.5 This is a super intense peach beer and it works really well. I love the base beer and the addition of peaches is an excellent compliment. If it was a little more tart, this beer would be perfect, but, as a fruited saison, it doesn’t get much better. 1,102 charactersTele, Apr 12, 2015

Mouthfeel is nice, slightly acidic and good carbonation. light dry finish - crisp

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75From 02/27/15 notes. HUGE thanks to the combo of nimbleprop, nmann08, and jslot38 for busting this out at my bachelor party in Charleston...one of my biggest wants.
Pours a hazy, burnt golden-orange color with two fingers of fluffy off white head and moderate carbonation evident. The nose is absolutely amazing; light tart delicious peach juice. Taste has more oak spice, yeast, grains, bready malts, oranges, and tropical notes. Medium body and moderate carbonation, easy to drink...doesn't feel like 10%.
Overall I love this; I like Logsdon a lot and this is their best beer by far. The nose is perfect; would love to get this one again sometime. Hope it comes to NYC more often. 684 charactersmdfb79, Mar 11, 2015
4.69/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Best by 01/2020 (guess I'm a bit hasty)
Look - Pours a lovely, foggy burnt orange with a nice off white head.  Good distribution, nice retention.  Excellent clinging.  4.75 paws.
Smell  - Holy moly, you can't put your nose within a foot of the glass without smelling the peaches and cream aromas.  Once your in there it's all peach, like canned peaches in syrup, likely from the pear juice.  So fresh and vibrant, wonderful.  5 paws.
Taste - The peaches are more subdued than on the nose, but are most definitely there.  It finishes amazingly dry, a bit of a wonder they were able to retain so much peach flavor and aroma without making the beer cloyingly sweet.  A bit of yogurt funk, bitter hop undertones, and lingering bitterness.  Subtle peppery spice, pear comes through on the finish.  4.5  paws.
Feel - Medium to full bodied, slightly viscous and grainy.  Little carbonation.  4.5 paws.
Overall - A tremendously enjoyable beer, I would be very curious to see how it ages.  I'm sure the peach aroma would fade, but the brett more developed brett character could add many layers of complexity.  4.75 paws. 1,116 charactersBowWowWowYippyYoIPA, Mar 11, 2015

750mL (bottle 13533; best by 01/2020) into a tulip. Pours a hazy golden orange w/ a fluffy white head that leaves behind some spotty lacing.
Aroma is tart, oaky, funky w/ a big blast of juicy peach. Brett yeast is the predominant aroma.
Taste is sour/tart with plenty of lactic acid. Dry oak. Subtle sweet peach sweetness lingers on the palate. Malt profile is neutral, slightly grainy. About as close as I've come to a beer that tastes and smells like fresh peach juice. Absolutely no trace of alcohol; pretty impressive for 10% ABV.
Mouthfeel is crisp and light, finishes very dry. Vanishes off the palate. Refreshing.
Overall another rock-solid brew from Logsdon. Worth the trouble hunting this down. 757 charactersdraheim, Mar 08, 2015

A: Bright yellow orange. Very orange. It almost seems to emit light. 
S: Peaches! Peach nectar actually; just like the syrup you get in canned peaches. 
T/M/O: That is a lot of Brett. And a lot of peach. I guess it's an accurate name! The two dominant flavors battle throughout the maintaste, neither particularly winning, though perhaps the Brett in the long run. Funky, dry, and very fun. Peach is a nice touch, but I think I prefer straightup Saison Bretta. Still. A great beer; recommended. 586 charactersAgentMunky, Mar 06, 2015

Peche n Brett 
A- pours a hazy golden yellow color with a creamy white head that retains long after the pour 
S- fresh peach aroma mixed with vanilla cream, with some Brett funk, notes of hay, vinous wood, earth and floral notes. 
T- fresh peach juice flavor hits the palate immediately, quickly followed by some Brett funk with notes of light barnyard and wet hay, slightly spicy leading to a dry finish with light tart and more peach. 
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a foamy and tart mouthfeel and a bone dry finish 
O- this is all about the peach, and it showcases it brilliantly, one of the best of the style IMO 681 charactersTreyliff, Feb 02, 2015

Appearance – Pours a cloudy peachy orange color with a beautiful head and very nice lacing.
Smell – A slightly sour smell with oak, brett, and vinegar.  I actually didn’t notice the peach.
Taste – Brett, white wine, oak, and just a slight hint of peach.
Mouthfeel – Tart and dry with a nice medium carbonation. A little sour aftertaste.
Drinkability – This is a pretty good sour – a style that I’m generally not a huge fan of.  Goes down easy for 10%abv. 540 charactersFalcon91Wolvrn03, Jan 24, 2015

4.81/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- Pours a very hazy and bright orange in color in the body. A head of about 1.5 fingers forms and retains for days, with pretty awesome lacing. The head is frothy and dense on top of the hazy body.
S- The peaches and brett hit the nose right away in a combo platter of juicy fruit and funk. There is a spicy element in the funk that is consistent with the flavor of the base beer. The peaches are a touch tart on the nose, but they are predominantly just juicy and fruity.
T- Starts off with a mild bang of semi-tart peaches. Just like in the scent, the peaches are more juicy and mild than tart. The spicy and funky base beer mixes in with the peaches and provides a depth of flavor. The funk picks up a little at the end of the drink and mixes with the peaches and gives an overall fruit orchard impression of the flavor.
M- Although the style of this beer is one generally associated with a light weight feel and high carbonation, this beer drinks incredibly smoothly. The carbonation is fairly high, but the weight of the beer makes this one feel way more smooth than the carbonation. There is no sign of the 10% ABV.
Overall, this is a fantastic fruited saison. I wasn't sure how I would like the peaches in the base since I didn't especially like the base beer, but the spice and funk really mellows and enhances the natural flavor of the fruit. This is a terrific beer. 1,381 charactersboilermakerbrew, Dec 21, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +8%A beautiful and delicious beer, full of peach taste and especially aroma. It's an amplified version of Seizoen Bretta which is already one of my favorite beers. The brett dryness and fruity taste are perfectly balanced. What's especially wild is that the beer's appearance is opaque and pulpy from all the peach bits floating around in it. Just don't expect a ridiculously strong and sweet peach juice taste, as this is still certainly a brett beer that just happens to have peach as one of its main ingredients. It's all in perfect balance here, and they clearly hit what they were going for. And this really doesn't taste like 10%, I could drink it all day. Crisp, fizzy, fruity, funky, just delicious. 704 characterskrustster, Nov 18, 2014

edit: batches since my first taste have been markedly less impressive. more weirdness to the yeast, less true fruit, i dont know if this has changed or not, of if there is an ageing curve, but i liked this the most when i had it first, and will leave high scores in tact to reflect that, but i have yet to enjoy it nearly as much as the first time... 1,538 charactersStonedTrippin, Sep 20, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%A big thanks to Jeff for this one. 750ml capped bottle into Tired Hands stemware. Shared with schen9303. 
Pours a foamy 1.5 finger light cream colored head with great retention. Beer is a slightly cloudy orange. Lacing is thick and layered with excellent stick. An awesome looking beer. 
Nose is fresh peaches and cream with hints of cane sugar. Very simple but the peach presence is one of the strongest I've ever come across.
Huge sweet peach flavor complemented by Brett funk, cane sugar, foam, coriander and floral notes. Lightly tart balanced by fruity sweetness throughout. Finishes peach skin and a slight woodiness. Really good.
Light bodied with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively in the mouth and goes down refreshing and crisp. Soft finish with a very clean aftertaste. Super drinkable. 
A big thanks again to Jeff for this hyped and hard-to-come-by brew. Certainly worthy of praise, this is one of the more unique peach "sours" I've come across. Not so much tart but really uses the sweet peach character very nicely. 1,038 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 04, 2014

Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big juicy and lightly tart peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, bread, hay, straw, grass, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of lightly tart peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, bread, hay, straw, grass, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness and slight tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, white grape, pear, green apple, white pepper, honey, hay, straw, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited brett saison. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, peaches, and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering. 1,663 characterssuperspak, Aug 30, 2014

4.1/5  rDev -6.8%Big thanks to eyebereej for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from 750 mL bottle into a Tampa Bay Brewing snifter glass.
A: Pours a hazy dark gold, with a big fluffy white head with great retention. Moderate visible carbonation. 4.5/5
S: Musty funk from the Brettanomyces, saison yeastiness, cracker malts, and dry tannins from the oak. I get minimal to no peaches on the nose, which is a bit disappointing. 15/20
T: Tart peaches under a big Brett funkiness, musty barnyard saison yeast and bready malts. Light oak tannins. Dry and lightly tart in the finish. The peach flavors do increase as the beer warms during the drink. 37/45
M: Average weight to body, good carbonation sensation, and the alcohol is well-hidden. 7/10
O: This was pretty tasty, but I was a little disappointed. I expected more peach flavor and tartness, and the Brett funk and wild farmhouse character seemed to predominate. I would recommend letting this one getting much closer to room temperature for full enjoyment. 16.5/20

4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Fresh peach skins overwhelm the olfactory senses from the get go. Light breezy notes of citrus is  joined by mild powdery brett funkiness, and the usual wet oak that seems to be ubiquitous in most Logsdon brews that either start or end with the word "Seizoen". ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Flesh juicy peach also makes an abrupt appearance once the brew starts to warm up and gradually intensifies; my advice would be to let this brew sit for a bit before diving in.
Peach, peach, and dare I say, more peach. The non-beer way to replicate this brew, I imagine, would be to bite into a juicy ripe nectarine while standing in a barn in full cowboy gear, letting that peach sit for a bit and then taking another bite once all the barnyard stank had time to infiltrate the 
surface of the peach. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Labored illustrations aside, the juicy peach character is followed by an abundance of yeast-y funk, spice, and a touch of tartness; like most Logsdon brews that either start with the word "Seizoen" this one also has a lightly earthy and clean citrus aftertaste toward the end.
Medium-bodied, creamy initial mouthfeel, with gentle carbonation. 1,164 charactersamano_h, Jul 19, 2014

S: A big blast of funky saison yeast, brett breath, sweet peaches, and pears.
T: Boozy. The alcohol appears prominently at the front and is then joined by dry, yeasty funk, grass, and . The peaches only appear on the finish. No tartness.
M: Thick but dry. The alcohol heat leaves a trail from throat to stomach.
O: Not sure what to think about this given how long it took me to chase it down. It's definitely good but the flavor isn't as complex as I was led to expect. 550 characters01001111, Jul 16, 2014

A cloudy orange liquid, I can only see a few bubbles but there's plenty in there somewhere as it pumps out a dense three finger foam that has great retention leaving rings deep down the glass
S massive peach nose, smells juicy as hell, some apricots, pear, green apple, doughy, mild funk and wood but for the most its fresh peaches, smells awesome I wouldn't change a thing
T more wood and funk and less of the massive peachy notes I was loving on the nose, still tastes great but then nose was a very hard act to follow 
M heavy side of medium, a little tart, just stays on the creamy side of foam, no booze on the way down, wood, brett, and peaches linger faintly for ages
O smells amazing, the booze is completely hidden, way too easy drinking, very well put together, everything meshes together beautifully 
This one hit the spot, the nose is unbelievable, 10% is completely hidden, not sure if I'd age this one with the peaches kicking ass right now, another one of those beers I want to drink the day its bottled and five years down the road. 1,154 characterswordemupg, Jul 13, 2014

Nose is sweet ripe peaches, biscuit and grain sweetness, earthy and herbal notes. 
Taking a sip, brett forward, earthy, and herbal bitterness, light funk, mellowing to sweet peaches. A bit of toasted biscuit malt sweetness. Finishes very dry, with a light lingering peach flavor.
Light body with very fine carbonation. Very refreshing, leaves the tongue very clean and ready for the next sip. 657 charactersnataku00, Jun 14, 2014

True to the name the brew is golden peach in colour clouded with what I can only hope is deliciousness. 
S: Sweet juicy peach with a close follow up of that familiar bret funk, sour and lactic acid . Tartness of citrus fruits and fresh sweetness with a very subtle whiff of oak.
T: Tart and tangy peach juice with white pepper, fresh lemon juice and lactic acid. Brett shows at the finish like a sucker on the tongue, dry tart and crisp. As it warms the peaches begin to fade slightly while the brett comes to the forefront. 
M: Snappy carbonation up front with a dry, crisp finish.
O: This is a fantastic beer that perfectly matches the acidity, dryness and funk of the brett with the freshness of peaches and it reminiscent of matching cheese and fruit. While this beer was difficult to find it was definitely worth the effort. 973 charactersFondueVoodoo, Jun 08, 2014

The beer pours a super cloudy straw color, hues of apricot and orange with a very, very, lively white head, soapy and frothy that settles at about 3 fingers and has great retention and leaves a huge wall of lace. The aroma is beautiful, tons of peaches, juicy and fresh, nice bretty funk and yeast character with light spice with some pale must grain. The flavors follow nicely, loads of juicy peach, fleshy, juicy and fresh with a bit of the pear juice that is present that also comes across like white grapes, nice funkiness and yeast character, true to the saison style, pale cracked grain, very rustic with light mustiness. The mouthfeel is great, almost creamy at times but with lots of lively carbonation that coats so well and finishes crisply that lets off so nicely.
Verdict: Sensational saison from Logsdon and one of my favorite beers ever. The peaches are showcased perfectly without undermining the base beer or the style and crossing over into a wild ale. This is definitely a must try and just a spectacular beer. 1,091 characterskevanb, May 26, 2014

S: My favorite part of the beer. This stuff smells fantastic. Right away, you get the advertised peach, but it's not the sweet, juicy peach puree kind of smell I was expecting. It's a tart underripe white peach aroma blanketed by some bretty funk. There is definitely a touch of sweetness there, but the barnyard funk really keeps things from getting too sweet. A great dash of oak, spice and just waves and waves of funk. I love this smell.
T: Opens with a tart note of peach and peach skin with a trace of underripe raspberry peeking through. A big wave of barnyard funk follows and it leaves a dry, tannic feel on your tongue. Soft oak, brett, peach pit and chalky malt. Everything is really well balanced and the peaches are a great addition. Mouthfeel is medium with some tight carbonation that allows all of the flavors to come through without being too distracting. The slightest bit of warmness on the swallow is the only trace of the 10%. A really well done beer. 1,148 charactersnotchucknorris, May 01, 2014

A- Dark yellow, hazy body with a one finger white head with solid retention, some lacing, nothing different from the base Seizoen-Bretta, to be honest. Though this is certainly hazier than I remember the base being.
S- Peach juice, a little bit of horseblanket funk, no acidity at all, slight tartness, some pale malt. But make no mistake about it, this is tasty peach juice.
F- Palate on this beer is even better than it smells. Some stone fruit skin, peach juice, slight horseblanket funk without any rubbery off-flavours, slight tartness, sharp wheatiness and a bit of spice. No real acidity to this but I will not complain about how much peach character there is.
M- Medium bodied, incredibly drinkable, plenty of carbonation that is very refreshing similar to the base beer. And there is absolutely no indication that this is a 10% ABV beer. Wow.
O- Excellent drinking experience, one of the best peach beers I think I'll ever have the chance to try. It's a nice improvement on the base Seizoen-Bretta, and I can't imagine the peach will stay around for much longer. This is a beer I definitely recommend drinking fresh. 1,215 charactersStevedore, Apr 24, 2014

A: As with every other bottle of Logsdon I’ve opened, this was a gusher. Or at least it would have been had I not bled some foam off the cap. Anyway, this beer pours a hazy dirty orange color with a fluffy and thick bright white head that faded into a very fuzzy and thick film and collar. A sheet of thick lace was left down the glass. 
S: Huge juicy notes of fresh peach mix beautifully with earthy, peppery and musty notes of brett and damp oak. Both sweet and juicy, dry and spicy. 
T: Earthy, yeasty and spicy flavors of brett with musty, dry and woody notes of oak. The finish is slightly funky and slightly bitter. I get a touch of acidic lemon, pear, and stinky cheese as well. The peach is there but not as juicy as the nose. There are flavors of peach pits and other stone fruits in the finish and aftertaste, as well as buttery oak and gritty tannins. Peach is sweet at times, but the oaked saision and brett balance most of it out. 
M: Medium-full body, airy fluffy and soft carbonation, with a drying, lightly bitter, and fluffy mouthfeel. Drinks very well. Double digit alcohol is masked extremely well.
O: One of the better saisons I’ve had. Fruity, funky, spicy, earthy, buttery and dry. I can see why this is so highly regarded. Having never had this aged, I’d still say drink fresh. The brett would develop further, but at the cost of the peach. Wish I had more. Cheers. 1,453 charactersscottfrie, Apr 18, 2014

 Having been brewed with Brett, there is just enough of those characteristics that make me say “oooh yeah, I smell the brett.” At the same time, the peaches are the star of the show and definitely take center stage. Juicy peach, lactic acid, faint citrus juice, wisps of alcohol and a little bit of oak. After I had carefully poured a few glasses to get a taste, I sloshed the beer in the bottle so I could mix the yeast and fruit sediment up and really get that ‘rustic’ flavor that I love in Saisons. Yehp, that definitely gave a little more ‘funk’ to the aroma as a whole. Absolutely amazing. 
On To The Flavor!
 The flavor is where the show really starts. Crisp mouthfeel and prickly carbonation coupled with a pleasant tartness makes this a beer I can’t put down. It has that quintessential Saison yeast flavor with grain, bubble gum, lemon and a little banana on the finish when it warms. Again, once aroused the sediment in the bottom of the bottle, the Saison characteristics really come through. As it warms, the alcohol gently numbs the palate. However, at no point in my imbibing do I taste alcohol. Brett shines a little more once the beer has warmed and had the sediment aroused. 
On To The Verdict!
 Honestly, this is right up there with West Ashley. While West Ashley is a Wild Ale and features a more ‘sour’ flavor profile, this beer is not far behind in terms of sour Saisons and really acts as a quintessential example of the ingenuity and creativity of brewers these days. Mr. Logsdon, if you are reading this, you have made this boy very happy!

Pours a murky juicy-looking light orange. Fizzy one inch head, not much lacing.
Smells incredibly peachy, fresh, slightly tart peaches, along with some lemon and acidity.
One dimensional taste, but a good taste nonetheless. Peach and sour tartness. Some lemons, too, maybe, tiny bit of oak.
Very highly carbonated, cuts down on some on the pucker factor. Light to medium bodied, crisp mouthfeel.
My jump into the deep end of the sour pool continues with these guys, this was also pretty good. 554 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 05, 2014

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've been hunting this one for a long time, so it's with great enthusiasm that I review this beer. Poured out of a 750 mL bottle with a wax-dipped neck and cap and marked with an enjoy by date of 01/2019. Served in a Boulevard Smokestack series tulip glass.
Appearance - A beautiful, cloudy amber orange-yellow hue with faint straw highlights in places. Atop the body sits a frothy two-finger head of off white with a yellowish twinge to it. Retention is excellent, taking several minutes to finally dissipate to an uneven layer of flim and pockets of thicker foam across the surface. Sheets of silky lacing remain for awhile before converting to more mottled streaks of sticky deposits on the side of the glass.
Smell - A great blend of ripe, fruity notes from the peaches and the funky twang from the brett. There are more subtle notes of light sourdough, but this one is all fruit and brett. Some musty, barnyard funk and peach pure as well as faint oak tannins and perhaps a kiss of grassy hops providing some balance. Really, just an intoxicatingly good beer--I could sit here and smell it for hours, but then I'd miss out on the...
Taste - Initial explosion of peach flesh and tartness that induces a pinch in the tastebuds at the front of my cheeks and on the tip of my tongue. That initial bit of sour fades away leaving notes of wet hay and funk with an underlying dryness alongside wood and an herbal hop bitterness. There are some white win-like characteristics as well, giving the impression of drinking a fresh-made peach bellini (sparkling wine and peach puree). I can't emphasize enough how much the fresh peaches come through in this beer.
Mouthfeel - Light bodied and moderate-to-high carbonation, providing a dynamic mouthfeel with notes of prickly tartness and a drying finish.
Overall, this is just a fantastic beer. It brings to mind just how disappointing it is that brewing with fresh fruit is such an expensive proposition, because when done well, beers with fresh fruit are hard to beat. This one is no different, and whoever thought of adding that distinctive yeast known as Brettanomyces to a peach-infused beer was a genius. The natural characteristics of the fruit work well with the funk of the brett. I will likely buy this every time I have the opportunity, as it is outstanding. 2,316 charactersLambicPentameter, Mar 30, 2014

Popped open the bottle, and found some red-brown residue around the top. No harm. Decanted into a Logsdon's cervoise. Medium amber color, slightly hazy, with a thin but well-retaining off-white head that left a few dots of lacing on the glass. Obvious peach in the nose, but I actually got more fresh saisoniness, wet grass, brett, floral notes. Crisp and clean on the palate, syrupy peach, damp wood, brett, toasted wheat, with a slight sour profile, and a finish of herbal and floral hops. Mouthfeel was crisp and complex, body was medium. Didn't taste or feel anywhere near 10%ABV, though as it warmed, a little essence of neutral alcohol came out in the taste. Great beer overall, and I'd definitely like to get some more. 
Word to the wise: despite what the bottle may say, this is not a beer to be aged. Peach fades fast, so drink this fresh! Age the base beer instead. 982 charactersRifugium, Mar 29, 2014

So happy I snagged a bottle of this...apparently only a few cases made it to the central valley this year. Pours a hazy golden color with a large white head that goes down fairly quickly. Scent is AMAZING! Packed with wild yeast and peaches. Especially as this beer warms, the peach aroma builds up and the brett comes out beautifully. Taste is a little more tart than the aroma would imply...which is never a bad thing. Peach skin and funky farmhouse flavors up front. Slightly tart peach flavors with great farmhouse flavors and barnyard hay. This beer is not spicy at all... straight up fruit, barnyard, and funk. So damn tasty. The peach comes out more and more with each sip. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and full-bodied. Drinkability is very high, as the ABV is well-hidden. This 10% farmhouse ale is not boozy in the slightest bit. Overall, Logsdon never seems to disappoint, especially with this one. Such an amazing farmhouse ale. The peaches shine brilliantly in this one. Believe the hype. 1,008 charactersDovaliHops, Mar 21, 2014

Smell reminded me of peaches and cream.
First sip was alot more sour than I had expected, but once i got further into it, the flavors melded together much better. Smooth peach and funk mixed perfectly. You get the vanilla and oak in there.
The 10% alcohol that's stated to have, hidden very very well.
Overall, never had anything like this before and it definitely lives up to the hype however i've heard that this year's batch was better fresh than last years. Left the farmhouse with plenty of bottles to see how they age. 625 characterspaul_db, Mar 17, 2014

Quick review from written notes.
This was the latest batch that came out this year. Hazy orange with a compact head and some spotty lace around the edges, thin veil across the surface. 
Nice subtle peachy aroma, pleasantly fruit forward. Increases as it warms.
Moderately sour upfront, lightly bitter in the aftertaste. Definite peach taste and aroma, seemed a little more prevalent in the taste. Overall a great wild ale, Brett wasn't all that expressive but you can't go wrong with a peach sour ale, imho. 568 charactersemerge077, Mar 17, 2014

Poursa murky orange much like peach purée mixed with filtered orange juice. Big tan head that lingers for a good while. Leaves a sticky film of bubbles on the top edges of the Teku.
Aroma is a bit subdued, it might be due to the cold temp. But there is plenty of juicy peach, guava, mango, strawberry, some bready malt, and a touch of that brettanomyces funk but barely there as the peach addition has taken over on this one. 
The palate explodes. Literally, if this isn't the peachiest beer I have had then Clinton really never did inhale. I've had peach beers before and none have expressed the flavor as good as this one. Holy mackerel! Peach for days with an oak, musty mineral brett dry finish. Yes there is sweetness but it flows deep mid palate and comes crashing to a stop on the finish. A low tartness jumps out pre-finish which overwhelms that sweetness and by the time it's all said and done you are left with a pretty dry aftertaste. Upfront though it's like biting into a juicy peach mixed with lemon juice and tart pear cider. Awesome stuff.
Mouthfeel is crazy good. Someone complained about it being watery, well let me just say, they're crazy. It is a saison and should not have a medium or thicker body. This one sits between the heavier side of light and lighter side of medium. Makes the beer super drinkable. Awesome carbonation which can be a problem when Saisons go in barrels. Not here, ample carbonation that lifts some of those uber juicy flavors away assisting in keeping it from becoming cloying. 
My final thoughts? Damn right deserves the hype that it gets and the only problem with this beer is that there is not enough. Logsdon does a good job in trying to spread the love but if you don't jump on this you get left out. This easily stands in my top three farmhouse ales (not sours) that I've had along with the LITTLE talked about Little Lobster On the Prairie and mega whale out of Hill Farmstead, Biere De Norma.
 Having a saison showdown this week and this overshadows Prairies Eliza5beth pretty substantially. Still have a few more which may stack up against this, Convivial Suarez and Le Saissonier coming next. 2,186 charactersMarcWP, Mar 09, 2014

The color is a golden amber, not unlike a Bellini. The taste is very fruit forward -- one of the biggest peach-flavored beers I've had this side of Chez Monus. You can almost feel the peach juice dribbling down your chin. Absolutely lovely. The sweet peach is firmed up by a bit of Brett funkiness and the barrel oak. This is as close to summer as you are going to get after a long, cold winter. Great beer, but I think I still might prefer the Seizoen Bretta a bit more. The subtleties of the saison are drowned out a bit by the intense peachiness. Still, a great beer. 650 charactersjjdc, Mar 08, 2014

4.61/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a honey amber color with excellent head retention and considerable laciing. On the nose, this beer really smells terrific. You definitely get a lot of peach (canned and fresh), but there's also some noticeable fruit cocktail, a hint of vanilla, and sort of "bretty" buttery funk aroma. The beer doesn't smell as if it's going to be all that sour, and in fact it wasn't. Otherwise, the flavor profile replicated the nose, but the balance in this beer is nothing short of amazing. There is a hint of sour, but it's just enough to counter the modest sweetness in this beer. Drinkability is just off the charts. Each sip begs for another one, and before I even knew what I was doing, I found myself reaching for the bottle to pour myself another glass. Alcohol is incredibly well integrated into the flavor profile. I did a double take when I saw the 10%.... there is no way I would have guess it was that high. Mouthfeel is fairly full with a long, lightly sour peach finish. However, there is nothing at all heavy or tiring about this beer on the palate, and this beer is just a joy to drink.
Excellent stuff.... even the usual out of the way places in town where I can usually find hard to find beers (MofC on Terwilliger and in West Linn, for example) were sold out of this beer, even though I'm sure they just got their supply in this past week. After trying this beer, I now have a better understanding why.
Edit from 4/12/14. As others have noted, this is not a beer to age or sit on. Sampled one of two bottles I still have left from the most recent release, and the peach flavor is already starting to subside a bit. It was stil tasty, but when very fresh, the peach flavor is prominent and just amazing, whereas now it's just one more voice in the flavor profile chorus. Still good, don't get me wrong, but when very fresh, this beer is just out of this world. 1,883 charactersJohn_M, Feb 24, 2014
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance- A tiny bit gushed out of the bottle before I poured, so be careful. Pours up a good bunch of head which has excellent retention. The head is a pure cotton-white while the body is a hazy and dull pale amber which appears brighter when held up to the light. A good amount of lacing with slight patches of sheeting. 
Nose- There are definitely peaches used in the making of this beer. Very well rounded and very smooth with light notes of other stone fruits like apricots. Some apple and banana and a slight note of pears. Redolent without being overbearing. Swirling doesn't add anything to the picture. 
Taste- Starts off with a front of peach that promises to be quite powerful but fades rather quickly. Slight woodiness from the hop bitterness. Slight funk and straw on the finish. Very tasty but not exactly the peach bomb I was expecting. Slight tartness and faint hints of acetic acid. Some cherry and other stone fruits plus a mild note of pears. This is very smooth and very well rounded to the point that this beer has incredible balance integration. No hint at all of the 10%. Very easygoing and delicate. Light barnyard, mushrooms, stinky cheese, straw, and armpit around the edges. I wish these aspects had more presence because that would definitely give this beer more character. Slight oak but this beer is mostly about the peach. Never cloying but always present, its presence makes it a must for peach lovers. Really good beer that shows inclinations of being great. No flaws at all and extremely drinkable. Such sublimity that I think it can be considered a great beer. This is a beer that really grows on you. Some hints of orange and lemon make this somewhat mimosa like or what I imagine a mimosa made with peach juice would be light. Nice dry finish really cleans up the flavor profile well. The pear juice works perfectly in concert with the peach notes. 
Mouthfeel- So light bodied that this tends toward airy. Light carbonation works really well for this beer. It doesn't make your tongue tingle but there is a mild and smooth effervescence that works well for this beer. 
Drinkability- Extremely drinkable to the point of being dangerous. It's so good that it's easy to ignore how good it is. Fortunately, it's pretty hard to get or I might being spending 20 bucks a pop on these frequently. 
Overall- Great beer that is definitely worth the 20 bucks. I would definitely take one of these over any Cascade beer (not that they're necessarily comparable but in regard to the price point). Reminds me a lot of La Fin du Monde which also doesn't have great complexity but is exceptional at the few things it does do. A must try if you can get your hands on it. While I'm scoring this lower than what I scored Seizoen Bretta, I'm under the impression that this is a better beer. I will have to sample the regular Bretta again to compare. 2,873 charactersartoolemomo, Feb 24, 2014
3.73/5  rDev -15.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75750ml bottle poured into a snifter. The brew appears a hazy orange with a solid white cap 2+ fingers strong that is composed of large bubbles and holds seemingly throughout the entire duration.
The aroma contains earthy brett upfront with a light fruit essence like apricot/peach but without getting sweet smelling. There is some funk and oak that blend into the brett that almost imparts a feel of sulfur.
The taste includes plenty of wheat and faded fruit that is like peach/apricot skins. It is somewhat carbonic and lightly mineral filled just like the base saison (which I wasnt crazy about.)
This is a lightly watery feeling brew with an abundance of carbonation. It is sadly cabonic an overall just ok. I have tried to approach this brewery with positive anxious thoughts but everytime I try their goods, im left underwhelmed. I would drink this again if given the opportunity but really, I dont see this as anything special or worth going out of your way for. Perhaps this was an off bottle? 1,002 charactersstakem, Feb 21, 2014
4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #500. Served at the January tasting at the Taproom. Thanks to Darren for bringing this! One of my top wants, which for some reason has been impossible to find every time it's released. Poured out of a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. I believe this is last year's release.
Logsdon is known in my mind for making nothing but gorgeous looking farmhouse ales, and this is no exception, in my mind. Looks a lot like fresh squeezed peach juice (or a combination of stone fruit, in general). Orange amber, with a thickness and cloudiness from the sediment and yeast, as well as a fluffy bone white head that covers the top of the glass in a graceful, imposing manner. Loses a bit of head retention over time, but leaves some sticky foam at the sides of the glass, thankfully enough. Really appetizing looking overall.
Not what I expected at all at the nose - while the stone fruit is displayed predominantly but the addition of peaches, as well as the malt profile at hand, the Brett has definitely made its mark on the beer in a funky yet strange appealing manner. At first, there's a blast of peaches, nectarines, and apricots (oh God, my mouth is actually watering as I write this), and then barnyard funkiness from the Brett, displaying notes of wet hay, some leather, and cheese. Lots and lots of cheese, particularly the goat cheese that stone fruit is often stuffed in. By a mere chance, apricot goat cheese happens to be one of my favorite things, so this isn't too off putting for me. Finishes tart on the nose, with an astringency from the yeast. Very wild, and very rustic, but I would have never guessed the alcohol was so high here.
The flavor is even funkier and intense, but it's really one of the most memorable American wild ales I've had in quite a while. Strong notes of peach concentrate, apricots, orange, and light pine meld with the funky qualities from the Brett, showing big cheese rind notes, leather, and wet hay. The oak qualities work their magic at the end and hold up the fort rather well, displaying lactic sweet flavors, as well as light tobacco and vanilla. This, in turn, accentuates a sweeter creamier factor that rounds out the Brett and gives the impression of eating actual goat cheese with stuffed dried peaches and apricots. The finishing touch of baking soda (a classic from Logsdon, as seen in their Saison Brett) cleanses the palate and gets you ready for each sip. Sweet, tart, funky, slightly saline, and creamy all at the same time. The carbonation is phenomenal here, done in the same vein as a sparkling wine. Gentle and enticing - very complex, and very refreshing.
This is a 20 proof beer?? No way - I could easily down an entire bottle of this without complaint. I would love to have a fresher bottle and open it right away, but the Brett here seems to build on some wonderful, creative aspects towards the beer's development. This could easily be the best beer Logsdon has made so far, and it's impressive that they've made a beer of this caliber so drinkable, and readily available for any occasion, as well. Excellent stuff! 3,084 charactersmagictacosinus, Feb 20, 2014
4.96/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is exactly what it says it is.
Reviewers that are looking for a very tart wild ale will think that this doesn't live up the hype, but this beer never claims that. This is a saison with brett, crammed into an oak barrel and then fermented with peaches and then pear juice. 
The nose is perfectly fragrant with peaches and brett.
The fruit comes through perfectly and plays harmoniously with the brett. 
This beer is so delicate, that you have to close your eyes while you sip so that your senses are opened to the mastery that this liquid is. 
To me, this beer is perfect because I can read a fucking label. 621 charactersTheeWalrusHunter, Feb 17, 2014

Their brett version is one of my top ten beers I've had and I love peaches. This beer delivered all of that. The color of the body almost had a peach skin note to it. The beer smells of fresh peaches. The taste is everything that is great about Seizoen Bretta but with beautful peach and floral notes. I can't recommend this enough and can't wait to get myself a bottle. 477 charactersPHBoiler, Dec 12, 2013

4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very cloudy, dark golden orange color with orange/tangerine edges and a one finger white head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind.  
Musty brett aroma with some barrel and a boat load of luscious organic peach.  Farmhouse yeast and musty funk in the nose with dry brett, damp wood and a very prominent peach presence.  Nice fruited saison.  The brett really stands out after it warms and is nicely complimented by the oak.  The peach character is dominant but doesn't smell artificial nor is it overpowering.  Nice balance of different characteristics in the nose. 
Medium bodied with a prominent musty brett character along with dry oak and sour peach.  The dry brett flavor is really strong with musty funk perfectly complimenting the farmhouse yeast.  Oak is dry/toasted but blends nicely with the bugs and funky yeast notes.  Peaches come in at the end with a luscious organic feel.  Not cloying or overly sweet with some sour acidity lingering in the finish. Slightly puckering with pit and fleshy fruit flavor.  Very complex but it's one of most balanced beers I've ever had.  Flavor and mouthfeel are nearly perfect.  I wasn't a fan of regular Seizoen or Seizoen Bretta but I highly recommend doing whatever it takes to try this one. 1,304 characterscorby112, Oct 05, 2013

Appearance: Hazy golden orange color with some visible carbonation streaming throughout. There was less than a finger of a white head that dissipated quickly leaving a collar around the edges of the glass. 
Smell: As one might expect peaches are the first thing you get in the aroma. It's more of a sour peach candy aroma than it is fresh peach skin or flesh. In addition to the peaches, there's some bretty funk, lemon, pepper, citrus, and pear.
Taste: Peaches, apricot, some barnyard funk, lactic acid, white grape, slight breadiness, and a some peppery yeast. Sourness is low, and balanced by a mild bitterness in the finish. 
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with medium levels of prickly carbonation. If it weren't printed on the label, I'd have never believed the ABV on this beer. It drinks more like 4% than 10%. This is hands down the most drinkable high ABV beer I've ever had.
Overall: This is an excellent beer and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. I still can't get over how drinkable this is. I had to stop myself from gulping it down too quickly. Definitely recommend seeking out a bottle or two. 1,185 charactersJonada, Sep 28, 2013

A - Pours a pale golden color with a cloudy overall appearance. A short cap of foamy white head forms and lingers briefly and falls to leave a thin collar.
S - Quite bretty with some nice funk. Sweet and quite peachy, a bit cool with some herbal qualities, fruity overall with some additions of grapey aromas too.
T - Surprsingly, not all that peachy. I get other flavors - notably grapes...very juicy. A bit on the dry side, fairly earthy and lots of dry brett character.
M - Dry overall. I get the odd flavor of artificial sweeteners/diet soda. Body is light with a lighter carbonation as well. Disappointing a bit with the lighter than expected fruit aspect.
O - Had very high hopes for this beer...not bad at all, but a bit of a letdown considering my expectations. Not nearly as peachy as I had hoped...overall quite dry and earthy in character with a strong alcoholic aspect that detracts a bit. 1,065 charactersportia99, Sep 21, 2013

S-Holy peaches! Perfect amount, not artificial at all. Tad bit of oak and grass.
T-Not as sour as I was expecting, still tart though. Great deal of peaches, a little too much for my tastes. 
M-Medium bodied and nicely carbonated.
O-A tad bit more sour notes and this could be perfect. Easily the best peach beer on the market. 384 charactersrlee1390, Jul 20, 2013

This beer looks like a peach. Very hazy, with a dark yellow orange color and a very full off-white head. A nice bit of lace marks the sides of the glass.
The aroma is light, sweet peach mostly. There is a bit of an acidic sour note. A bit of funk is in the background, but not much.The fruit flavor does not come through as fully in the nose as I would want. The nose is softer than I like in my sours.
The flavor could be peaches and cream, although it would be a light version. The flavor has a crisp, tart, peach flavor with a bit of cream. There is a bit of funk to it, but this beer is rather light and simple for my taste. The finish is a little bit dry.
The mouthfeel is rather light for a 10% beer. It is a little bit tart, and there is a bit of creaminess, but overall it is a bit tame. The carbonation is light and creamy, with a dry and sour finish.
This is a well-made beer, but as a lover of puckering sour beers, this just does not get there. It has a high ABV and a saison finish, but it does not have the intense sour fruit notes I enjoy. 1,102 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jul 07, 2013

Fully opaque cumquat with a vibrant white head which abates very slowly leaving a tight spider web lattice.
Tart and tangy peach, like a cross between peach Pez and vitamin C tablets, alongside plenty of sweaty horse-blanket funk. Bright, clean and snazzy.
Drier flavours with considerable acidity. Earthy peach, lemon-lime and hay.
Medium to full with somewhat aggressive carbonation and mild booze heat.
Rollicking fruit Saison, if a little too big for its boots. Bemused as to why this needed to be 10% 588 charactersspicelab, Jul 02, 2013

A: Pours a hazy peach with a 1/2-inch white head which fades slowly to the rim leaving spotty lace.

T: Peaches up front with some lemon and funk. Slightly sour. Earthy minerality and grassy.

Pours a minimally cloudy golden color with a fluffy white head. 
The nose gives off some funky tones from the brett, with some underlying peach.
Very refreshing taste. Light funkiness from the brett gives way to peach yogurt flavors. Tasty.
Mouthfeel is good, perhaps a touch over carbed.
Overall this is a great brew, I see it as a nice sipper on a warm day. I would definitely drink this again. 435 charactersthebigredone, Jun 23, 2013

Poured into my large St. Feuillien goblet, Peche 'n Brett is chill hazed burnt gold with a creamy, tight bubbled white head leaving sheets of foamy lace. 
Smell is gorgeously soft, sweet peaches and pear nectar. The brett flutters through the fruit oh so subtly, adding just a touch of depth. Really fantastic. 
Taste is also soft, the peach evident yet softened by the drying brett, which is really rather clean, while still making it's presence known. Perhaps just a touch understated, but the delicate nuance really adds the drinkability. 
Mouthfeel is soft and dry, with fine carbonation. 
Drinkability is high, it's really hard to believe this is 10% ABV. Not to mention how subtle the brett and sweetness from the fruits are, no palate wrecker here, just extremely balanced. What an elegant beer, fantastic. 888 charactersccrida, Jun 17, 2013

Pours a hazy tangerine hue with a loose, quarter inch, bright white head that dissipates into a consistent slick. The nose on this beer is fantastic - peach cocktail. Taste is lightly tart with peaches and perhaps apricots. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an assertive acidity. This beer is pretty incredible I have to say. I don't get much Brett, but lots of peach and an extremely well-hidden abv. 470 charactersJwale73, Jun 11, 2013

Gorgeous cloudy orange juice color with fine, scattered beading. An appropriate finger of bone white head forms pinpoint lacing and noticeable booze legs before settling back to form a thin cap on the beer. Absolutely stunning just to look at.
Bold, semisweet peach explodes from the glass. Floral, incredibly fresh fruit flesh melded with sour white grape, pear skins and a mildly acidic citrus quality.
Wow. I really didn't know what to expect on the palate... Like nothing else I can think of... It's a work of art. Bright orange and peach flavors collide with dry funky Brett, fresh oak and juicy pear.
Wonderfully soft velvet consistency provides the perfect vehicle for the flavors described.

M- Light boded, very low carbonation, it does finish a little watery and became more watery as it warmed up some
O- The flavor and aroma are nice, but not as complex or pleasant as the Seizoen Bretta I had just two weeks ago. The mouthfeel held this back for me quite a bit, a little too watery but a nice brett beer. Can't believe this is 10%, it drinks like a 4%, very light. 754 charactersHoptometrist, May 10, 2013

A: Pours golden with a nice covering of snow white head which recedes quickly to a ring. Very good retention for what head there is, and some nice chaotic streaks of lacing.
S: Fresh cut, sweet, delicious peaches and an undercurrent of spice, a little malt, and very mild citrus hops, and a little oak as it warms.
T: Peaches and pale-ish malt, some fruity esters and a little brett, and more juicy citrus fruit on the medium length finish. Mild acidity gives this a little brightness. A little oak character comes through as it warms to near room temperature.
M: Medium carbonation with noticeable bite which softens with some time in the glass. Creamy texture and no alcohol noticeable at 10 (!) percent.
O: Exceedingly--nay, dangerously--drinkable. A very well executed farmhouse ale. The fruit is prominent but not overwhelming. I guess if I had any complaints, it would be that I don't get a lot of oak character, and the brett is pretty minimal. 969 characterspmarlowe, May 03, 2013

A: Pours a nice cloudy gold with pink/orange hues around the edges. There is a good amount of head, but it settles quickly, leaving a rocky layer across the top of the beer.
S: The nose is huge fruity peach/apricot, a good helping of brett, some additional funk, and touch of fresh cut grass. The peach notes are exactly self evident, but this beer is definitely fruit forward.
T: Right away I get a good mix of fruit and funk. The peaches are there and they mix well with the funky brett, but it's not super intense peach. It's just a nice balance between sweet and tart fruit and brett.
M: Light bodied beer. Good amount of carbonation, sweet to start followed immediately by that familiar brett funk. The flavors last through to the finish where is dries up a bit, leaving some residual funk to the palate. 
O: This is a pretty darn good beer. I was really hoping that the peaches would be ridiculously over the top, but it wasn't. Still... the flavors are great and the brett funk is just right. I am incredibly happy to have been able to try this beer, and would love to try it again in the future. 1,148 characterstrxxpaxxs, Apr 29, 2013

Score: 94
2012 vintage bottle served in a Goose Island Flag Snifter and enjoyed on 03/06/13.
Appearance: Dull golden straw color. Less than a coating of clump, off-white head from the pour. Poor lacing, belong average retention. 3.5/5
Smell: Ripe peach bomb! Also some straw and that smell one associates with bretted beers. Almost entirely peach on the nose. Not very complex, but smells delicious! 4.5/5
Taste: The peach flavor is not very tart and is best described as "delicate" -- it is "soft" and coats the tongue, but is not super intense. More straw than in the nose, a little funk and a little bit of grassy hops too. Has an interested finish that is acidic, hoppy and mildly tart at the same time. Tartness mellows out as it warms. A little pepper in finish. 4.25/5
Mouthfeel: Light bodied, low carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel with a little dryness on the finish. Acidic, but the acidity mellows out as it warms. 4.25/5
Overall: Not nearly as "sour" as anticipated, but pretty tasty nonetheless. Maybe I am just a sucker for peaches.

Bottle to Blue Palms taster
750 ML
Batch 2
Shared with GuruDel and MrHyschybar
App- When this came out of the bottle. It was a very dark orange with a bit of a haze to it. The bubbles were a bit small and didnt leave any cling like a normal saison would. The barrel took some of the carbonation away and left more a dark color.
Smell- I was expecting an explosion of deep barnyard "funk" with the oak balancing things out and then the peche coming in to tie it all together. The peche was a bit small on this one and the ABV made for a unique balancing act of aromas on this one. A bit of a crushed damp wheat smell was in there as well.
Taste- Well I have to say I was a bit let down. Maybe I thought it would be more like V010 (Which I havent had) I was expecting maybe this giant peche explosion with a Rayon vert like flavor to just blow me away. I got more of the wood barrel and small funk with only a small bit of peche behind it. Well layered but lacking in "pop" for me.
Mouth- This had a good feel behind it. A bit medium in body with a good amount of thick carbonation with a solid funk residual flavors behind it. The peche didnt stick around for very long and the barrel seemed to dominate again with that crushed wheat flavor.
Drink- It was a good beer, but again didnt blow me away. I think letting a bottle sit, might help. I truly feel this wouldve been better as say a wild ale with more of a light flavor and more peche behind it. I am glad this was at a share and not a traded bottle. 1,531 charactersFosterJM, Apr 14, 2013

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a clear peach juice with a thin white quarter inch head that fades to a light thin blanket.
S - Super bretty with very light, super dry peach notes. Faint horsehair and peach syrup. Not quite as peachy as I figured it would be.
T - Taste is well, peach and brett. Light peach juice and canned peaches. The pear comes through as well thanks to the base beer. Again though, not nearly as much peach as I thought this would have. No alcohol at all though.
M - Mouthfeel is sold. Its light and crisp with no noticeable alcohol. Super impressive.
O - Overall, a good beer but not quite worth the hype. I have a few bottles myself and I think Jared just got an old bottle as there really should have been more peaches in this. 962 charactersrudzud, Apr 10, 2013

4.67/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Thanks to anadune for this one, super high up there on my "wants" list, glad to finally see this one go. I love peaches and I love Brett, so this beer should do me well. Pours a brilliant sunburst color with hints of golden-peach flowing about. Cloudy and opaque for the most part with a foamy white head that has decent retention.
Whoof! Talk about funk! The aroma hits hard, right out of the gate, and doesn't let up. Copious amounts of Brett just unleash and unload on the senses - barnyard funk, damp cellar, and wet hay. And then, of course, the peaches! There's a vibrant peach presence that underlines the funky body of the beer - it's sweet, juicy, and authentic, and perhaps most importantly - it's not overdone at all. Rather than control or overtake the aroma, the peaches just accent it, and inject their juicy goodness in a moderate but noticeable amount, a nearly perfect complement to the barnyard funk. Sweet and funky all at once - how can you not love that? The oak can be found once you "search" for it, and once you find it, it doesn't go away. Beautiful woody tones round out this excellently aromatic profile. Exquisite.
I couldn't have been more excited to finally bring this one to my lips... as soon as it hits my palate, the funk just plants itself in my mouth and never lets go. This bitch is SUPER funky; tons of barnyard, horsey sweat, musty earth, cheesy-funk... Absolutely crazy. The oak makes a big comeback and tastes much more robust than it smelled - works perfectly with the insane amounts of Brett that are going wild right now. And then again - just like an epiphany similar to the aroma - the peaches just squeeze their way in, quietly and unobtrusively, adding just the right amount of presence and flavor. Seriously, they could not have been added to this beer in a more perfect amount. Enough to tame the Brett and keep your taste buds working, but not enough to overpower and turn this thing into a peach cobbler.
I wouldn't necessarily describe this beer as "sour", but there certainly is a light tartness that hits you initially with the onslaught of Brett. By the time the peaches take the forefront, the tartness will have faded and the beer takes on a lovely sweetness that nicely combines with (and is probably aided by) the peach flavors. My friend and I were surprised to find out this beer was clocking in at 10% ABV - there's just no possible way that much alcohol can be masked so well. Honestly, this drinks just as easily as the Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen gueuzes we had previously, and those contain nearly half the alcohol. Peche n' Brett has a medium body; sharp, slick, and wet mouth feel with a medium-high amount of carbonation.
Wow, what a truly unique and amazing beer. Perfect amount of peaches and a nice compliment to their wonderful Brett profile. I thought this one was a huge improvement over the Seizoen Bretta (although that was still very good). Took me by surprise, but I hope I'll have the chance to enjoy this one again. Top notch. 3,013 characterstectactoe, Mar 31, 2013

The taste of the beer is mellow, there is a nice sweetness from the Peche and a very subtle tart Brett finish. Very smooth mouthfeel, very drinkable. Overall it's very good.

4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance. A little bit of a gusher but this came straight from the cellar without additional chilling in the fridge. Pours a bright, rich gold with a little peach and a finger of white head that leaves some great lace. 
Smell. Massive amounts of peach ...not exactly fresh but sweet and tart like a fresh peach pie, some dry brett funk and dried hardwood, a bit of light grainy malt and maybe a drop of rum.
Taste. Nice light peaches, lightly sweet and lightly sour much like fruit itself, some dry brett, a bit of bitter wood and little wheaty and grainy light malts. The brett lasts a while on the tongue.
Mouthfeel. Medium body, medium+ soft carbonation. Nice warmth in the throat. 
Overall. A very nice saison with plenty of peaches. Nothing too mind blowing, but a very high quality beer like everything from this brewer. 832 charactersRutager, Mar 26, 2013

Near turbid golden with a central dome of light cream foam and little lace. The nose is really nice, peaches, apricots, brett, seltzer, vitamins, tart tones and just a touch of sweetness at the end. Nice tartness on the sides of the tongue, some brett watery character, some bits of lacto style yogurt character and plenty of peach, but the peach seems unripened. Medium on full bodied with hi carb that dissipates quickly and leaves me quite dry - this forces me to take another drink...sadly/not! Nice beer. 526 charactersharrymel, Mar 23, 2013

Appearance: Classic tawny orange hazy body with a 2 finger off white billowy crown that shows great retention and lace. 
Smell: A lovely medley of peach, saison yeast, a bit of brett funk, a hint of aspirin, and a sour tinge. 
Taste: Faint peach, light brett funk, a muted acidity, a bit of aspirin, a bit of flinstones chewables, the faintest whisper of band aid, alcohol peaking through momentarily to say hello, with a slightly metallic finish. 
Mouthfeel: Thick side of thin bodied with moderate carbonation but a nice creamy crown that really helps.
Overall: Other than the flavor profile, this is a really solid saison. I can only hope that a fresher batch would be tastier and hope to track one down at some point. 780 characterskoopa, Mar 20, 2013

As soon as the cap was cracked this exploded with fizz and went all over the kitchen. Never seen anything like it, was like a shaken up bottle of champagne.
Pours an insanely thick apricot color with small brown flakes floating around. Obviously the sediment has been disturbed here. Looks like a fruit purée.
Smell is all sweet canned peaches with only a hint of sour. Smells wonderful.
Taste is a little less impressive but still great and mostly the same--loads is sweet peach, a touch if tartness and brett but mostly fruit.
Body is really thick but carb is pretty low, I guess the initial explosion kinda killed the carb here.
This was plenty good but probably not a representative sample given that our bottle pretty much literally exploded before we poured any of it and we lost about half the bottle. Would like to try it again.

smell, exactly as the name states, I get some peaches and some brett sour funk, little else and not particularly inviting
taste- of course this is not a bad beer, but given the hype and subsequent expectations,this is a huge letdown. it is a one note peach and some light light funk right at the front of the tongue and fades to a dry metallic flavor. I understand this is 10% and I give the brewers a ton of credit for this attempt but certainly falls way short compared to the top dogs in this game. Competing with AWA's of the world and other lambics and guezes, it wouldn't stand a chance. 
I always use baseball analogies whenever possible and if you compare this to a top Awa ( RR, LA, guezes) It would be like me facing pedro martinez in his prime, if I am peche n brett and the big dogs of the sour game are pedro. 
I will say as it warmed it improved modestly with some more funk notes permeating the palate , but unless you can get it on the cheap and don't have to give up much in a trade, i'd rather just spend that money on some RR varieties with a good sushi lunch . 1,112 charactersjsm1289, Mar 11, 2013

poured into tulip glass.
reviewed from notes.
Had Peche 'n Brett side by side with Fantastia b2.
Appearance: opaque orange bodied beer with thin white head that drops down to no head. 
Smell: light notes of peaches and dried apricots. Musty basement funkiness. Yeasty.
Taste: Musky funk forward with brett notes. Hint of peaches and possibly some citrus notesas well. Finishes with more funk, oak and earthiness becomes more pronounced.
Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Carbonation is at the perfect level. It has soft carbonation while remaining lively just as you would want it to be for this beer style. This beer is without a doubt the most light bodied beer sitting at 10% and its by a long shot. It drinks like its around 4 to 5% abv. Super drinkable and not even a hint of the 10% abv level. How Logsden did that with this beer has impressed me.
Overall: Really glad that I got to try this beer! Its the best beer that I have tried from Logsden! Fastastia just edged out the Peche 'n Brett in the side by side. 1,095 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Mar 10, 2013

Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation.
Had side by side with Fantasia and I give a slight edge to Fantasia. I'd say worth seeking out if you don't have to pay an arm and a leg. Base beer is great as well. Thanks egrace84. 514 charactersDuff27, Mar 10, 2013

A- Pours a hazy peach... yellow color, topped with a thin white head.
S- Mostly a huge, huge load of peaches. Just a whole lotta peaches, which are juicy and fresh and awesome. There are also some notes of lactic acidity and mild brett notes.
T- Similar to the aroma, although the peaches are slightly toned down. Still, lots of fresh juicy peaches, lactic tartness, mild brett flavors and some oak. 
M- Medium-bodied, smooth and nicely carbonated, dry finish. The alcohol is seriously invisible, can't believe it's 10%.
O- One of my new favorite peach beers, I've loved everything so far from Logsdon, this was a real treat. 694 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 09, 2013

The looks is nice, it has a frothy whirring of head, some lacing, and a solid hazy orange color. The smell is just saturated with peaches, nice fresh peaches that really remind me of getting them off a farm in Virginia and Georgia. Nice oak and slight sweetness in the nose as well. Not really funky in the nose for me, aside from a wiff of Brett.
The taste is also very peachy, some more tart and dry notes come in at the back of the palate. Some semi sweet note to it, but it is very dry overall and a nice barnyard tinge straw maltiness too. Brett fruitiness comes through, 
The feel as mentioned is dry, and has nice carbonation. Almost hard to gauge the body of this with how dry it is, mixed with the acidic acid. 
A very nice beer, but maybe not all the way up to the hype. 829 charactersDreadnaught33, Mar 09, 2013

Bottle No. P2192. Best by 12/2017.
Pours a murky light orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and slightly funky with peach and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with a fermented peach flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is light and refreshing despite its ABV. 627 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 05, 2013

Pours a light fizzy head that barely comes, hazy peach color.
Nose has some Brett funk, horsehair, light peaches, fruity but funky, canned peaches but light.
Taste starts funky, wild Brett but not super funky, nice juice, fresh canned peaches, esters and hint of phenols, grainy bready yeasty, smooth and doesn't drink like 10% at all, finish is juicy, light bitterness, peach, syrupy and sticky, light dusty oak.
Mouth is med bodied, decent carb.
Overall not bad, but not as good as I expected. Drinks well, but peaches are too light, and funk isn't as much as I expected either. 670 charactersjlindros, Mar 04, 2013

With a slow gush that renders to nought all my patience in letting this settle down after a rough ride in the shopping cart and the subsequent drive home, this beer is a hazy, peachy orange with a dense, light peach head with excellent retention and moderate lacing. Does a non-gushing Logsdon beer even exist? Never mind. The beer itself is fantastic. The nose exhibits such a bright, vibrant and delicate peach nose, fresh, fragrant, fruity and floral that it makes me want summer all over again. The base saison is clear - spicy clove and white pepper with a blend of Brett phenols,barnyard, with honey, rustic grains (spelt?) and a touch of fattiness and yeasty aroma that does serve to accentuate the fruit, the nose is incredible. A touch of coriander seed is also present.
The palate opens with an exceptional blend of peach flavor, mild peach acidity and saison and Brett spices. A blend of lemon and peach acidity lends a piquancy that really does open up the palate to multiple waves of flavor. White pepper, clove-y Brett, a little bit of spicy alcohol, barnyard, a faint bay leaf note, a little bit of kaffir lime brightess, the aromatics of orange blossom honey, all in beautiful harmony, the palate really is an education. Despite its strength, the peach flavor never takes over, playing the role of an equal partner in this complex piece. Recognizably and enjoyably deep and varied, it lends an excellent flavor here. A touch yeasty on the finish along with a blend of peach, clove and honey, this beer is medium in body, moderately carbonated and a treat on the palate. The nose had me worried about whether this would be too fatty for my liking, but good lord, is this near perfect. The alcohol is shockingly well-hidden, there is no way I would have pegged this at 10%. 
Easily the best beer I've had in 6 months. The way the peach is expressed on the nose reminds me of my first encounter with Yellow Bus in its youth with all the brilliant peach aromatics stunningly layered. This comes with the highest of recommendations.
**Edit 21 Feb 2014**
Note to self : stop aging beers. Especially those that don't need it. 
Less peachy, more Brett forward than when fresh, slightly sulfury/ farty with the peach being more of a tart peach/ character than the bright, complex redolent peach character that it had fresh. That said, it's still fleshy and mildly frothy. The palate still has a ton of peach, but it does seem to have lost some of the brash brilliance of its youth. The peach juice has fermented out, leaving an earthy, spicy Brett character. Moderately sweet nonetheless, this is still very good closer to a 4.3 than 4.6 fresh. Yeast character is moderate and a faint heat are noticeable. 2,848 charactersDefenCorps, Feb 25, 2013

Pour: Hazy, bright orange. Two fingers of fluffy white head from and leaves some heavy, thick lacing. Fantastic looking beer.
Smell: Woah! Big peach and pears up front, as well as some pineapple, mango, and grapefruit. A very pronounced funk. Hints of sweet breadyness enter, but only just. This just smells perfect, and maybe the best smelling beer I've ever had.
Taste: Big peaches up front, that quickly subside into lactic tartness and a very earthy brett funk. Lemon, white grape tannins, and pear. The Seizoen Bretta base is undeniable through the mid-palate. Finishes with tart peaches and pear, more funk, and a dry white wine barrel oak.
Mouthfeel: Insanely juicy. No hints of alcohol whatsoever. Goes down very easily, and finishes quite dry.
Overall: This is a top tier wild ale, no doubt. I think I prefer Mimosa a tad more, and Oak Aged Bretta more than both. I absolutely will be seeking this out again soon. 987 characterscfrances33, Feb 17, 2013

A: Small hiss as the seal is broken, then pours a pretty apricot/copper orange with foamy/fizzy whiteness cresting just at the edge of the glass. Bubbles percolate and cling precariously, head doesn't last (a breaking skimcoat seconds after the pour), neither does the lacing. Overall complexion is slightly haze, moreso as the bottle nears its finish.
S: Nose-tickling 'funk', a bready/earthy/ moldy medley that reeks of wet hay and over-ripened fruit. Good strength - really present when poured warmer, closer to 'room temperature'.
T: Soft peach skin, juicy and laced with tartness. Lemon rinds, green apples, cut grass, a trace of pine. Finishes kind of acidic... with a chalky/mineral bitterness.
M: I'm susceptible to reflux from acidity, and got it right away on first sip. oddly, it mellowed out quickly and things were fine as the smoother grainy/bready characteristics gave balance. Not too fizzy/carbonated - medium body. This is 10%? Wow, one would hardly know it.
O: After tasting this beer at least 5 times, it's safe to say: "a terrific beer". Considering the "best by" dating on all bottles extends 5 years into the future, ALL are pretty 'young', so it'll be interesting to taste them again in 2, 3, 4 years (or more). Suffice to say the 'peach' is upfront right now, the tartness zesty and aggressive. Thank goodness there are a few cellared to taste later. Well played, Logsdon. 1,472 charactersmsubulldog25, Feb 14, 2013

750mL poured into stemless wine glass.
Loads of peach upfront that wasn't overbearing. Followed by the fruity farmhouse, yeasty flavors that brought out a mild acidity and low sourness. As classified as a wild ale, I expected more tartness but this level was all good. The oak added a nice depth of tannic mellowness. The oak may also have to do with the hints of vanilla detected. Very impressive.
EDIT: Beer was previously classified as a wild ale before it was corrected.

Less peachy and more saison apple-tartness than I remember, but still very enjoyable. Dangerously drinkable at 10% ABV. My wife really liked it. One of the best farmhouse ales, at least Top 3, that I ever enjoyed. 805 charactersRollzroyce21, Feb 05, 2013

Hill Farmstead
A: Hazy bright orange color. Got about a a half finger of bright white head. Faded into a layer and then a ring around edges. Some sticking lacing.
S: Smells of full on Brett. Not getting as much peach character as I was expecting. What's there is that fresh peach flesh. Wheat. Some pepper notes As it warms, more wet hay from the Brett.
T: Up front you don't get the tartness I was expecting. You get the sweet apricot wheat and thin malts. In the back end you get some tartness from the Brett. Definitely getting that soft oak aging. Rounded flavor. Dry finish.
M: Medium bodied. 620 charactersinlimbo77, Feb 04, 2013

Moderate-to-high carbonation and a full, thick mouthfeel. Creamy and just a bit slick from the alcohol, which is otherwise almost undetectable.
Not as sweet as I suspected, with mild peach, oaky vanilla, apple and pear, a trace of funk, and peppery spice. Finishes very dry and keeps you coming back for more.
It was hard to drink this one slowly. Amazing balance, totally delicious. Doesn't supersede the base beer for me, but I love how they integrated the peach. Not at all overdone. 644 charactersgrittybrews, Feb 03, 2013

Hazy peach body - thin layer of beige bubble. "Tastes like a Logsdon beer". The brett is in full force - aging this beer seems foolish. The glorious peach notes hit in the finish and are a real nice contrast of sweet-tart. Grassy, funky, some oak, bready notes. Fantastic stuff. 309 charactersdirtylou, Jan 27, 2013

S- Peaches, oak and brett non-surprisingly dominate here. Some sweet bready malts round out the nose.
T- A serious upgrade over their regular seizoen-bretta. The peach is fresh with the oak adding more layers of flavor. Drying oak and brett play together very well. The tannins of the wood combined with the fruit replicate the sense of sucking on a peach pit. Subtle notes of vanilla add as a great natural pairing with the fruit.
M- Smooth and creamy. Drying with a lingering tart/sweetness and light bready malt. I cannot believe that this beer is 10%! Dangerous at the rate im drinking this.
O- Highly recommended. Im curious to see how this one ages. Its so good though that im afraid my last bottle will be gone too soon to find out! 799 charactersstx00lax, Jan 26, 2013

A: murky orange with a solid three finger head. I expected this not to be clear, but it's incredibly hazy. Not chunky thank goodness, but still nothing amazing to look at.
S: peaches and funk. Bretty goodness with a solid peach backbone and some hint of crisp acidity. Smells delicious!
T: peaches right up front. Surprisingly not as over the top as I was expecting. Almost balanced with the mild acidity and Brett character. Seems like the Brett is playing into the fruit flavors, with it's funky notes playing a supporting role. Very, very nice.
M: just perfect. It's a light bodied brew, but the perfect level of carbonation and the silkiness and richness of flavor provide a mouth filling experience. 
O: awesome. I was expecting this to be a bit of a letdown. So talked up, I generally assume that it can't actually be THAT good. This one lived up to it's reputation. I would put this above any other Saison I've had. And that is how I would characterize it after drinking it. Reads as a beautiful Saison with fruit. The Brett is apparent, but if you put this next to their other brews, the comparison would be obvious I think. Interested to see how this ages as the fruit fades and the Brett takes a funkier and stronger role. 1,285 charactersoregone, Jan 25, 2013

The peach fruit was more apparent on the palate with good bretty barnyard funk, slight spice, hints of citrus zest alongside great oaky accents and a touch of apple pear flavor.

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Slight gusher on the outset, should have been prepared, luckily only lost a couple drops as we had glasses ready.
Pours a very hazy yellow color with a thick white head that recedes to leave a thick amount of soapy lacing. 
Aromas begin quite rustic and earthy intially which was surprising. There is a nice earthy, bretty funk with a sugary pilsner/pale malt base. As it warms there is a slight presence of peaches but honestly I was expecting more. There is also more and more emerging oak and some Farmhouse spiced yeast. 
The tastes follows the nose with plenty of oaky wood and yeast-induced spice with some moderate tartness. There is a very solid rustic bretty funk to this with more and more emerging fruity apricot notes. 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation on the higher end of medium. Finish is perfectly dry and musty and earty with slight stone fruit in the background. 
Overall I would have liked a little a little more peach flavor to balance the saison backbone but that aside this is probably the best Farmhouse ale (and definitely the best organically produced beer) I have ever had. I wouldn't call it a wild ale, per say, because it was more rustic and less overly sour or tart. The fact that this was 10% was ridiculous, it drinks like 7% max. Not a drop of alcohol. I would say crack this ASAP as I believe the peach flavor is fading and the Brett is really taking hold. I definitely plan to seek out more beers from this new Oregon farmhouse brewer. 1,490 charactersclaspada, Dec 04, 2012

A- Pours a hazy light orange with a one finger head that leaves a few lines of lacing.
S- Tons of ripe peaches upfront followed by some lactic, brett, oak, lemon peel and a bit of vinegar
T- Again the peaches are the star of the show with fresh peach juice and peach skin with some lactic notes, which reminds me of peach yogurt. Oak, vinegar and a hint of brett follow.
M- Medium carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel.
O- Definitely the most surprising beer of the two day tasting, which included the 4 BA DL'S, Rare, BA Speedway, Damon and many other good ones. The 10% is nowhere to be found in this.

Acquired via trade
Thanks, cavemanlawyer!
Hazy golden orange and peach in color with a quickly forming, persistent near-white head. High carbonation, as this one started bubbling over the bottle's lip upon cracking. This leaves the glass absolutely sticky with a thick film of lace down the glass. Gorgeously sticky!
A complex, marvelous, balanced, delicate, yet bold aroma. The Brett yeast is toned down when compared side-by-side with the straight Bretta version, though here it's marvelously complementary as opposed to in your face. The addition of the peach and additional wood notes is striking yet delicate. This is a peach/funk/earth lollipop. Yes, please!
Peach and white fruits dominate, as initially this beer almost seems too sweet. It doesn't take long to realize that it isn't, as there's a very nice earthy and funky bitterness that complements the ripe peach notes, along with a hint of wood and even more barnyard funk.
Medium bodied, creamy, with moderate-high carbonation.
Simply phenomenal. I wish I could drink this by the barrel. 1,071 charactersehammond1, Aug 05, 2012

O: Goodness in a bottle, and I wish this wasn't such a limited release. Definitely not a beer for people who hate this particular stone fruit, though. I'm hesitant to age my other bottle because I'm afraid the peaches will disappear. 693 charactersSarlacc83, Jul 01, 2012

S-Peaches and funk. the fruit is up front and then the brett funk comes through great. An awesome smell for a brett beer. True brett characteristics and a great fruit character. 
T-Again peaches, in such an awesome way. It actually is almost like peaches and cream. The brett gives it a creamy taste. An at 10% ABV!? It tastes like 5% easily. One of the most drinkable higher abv beers that I have had.
M-Bubbly crisp and clean. Sharp on the tongue and then easy on the palette. 
O-Goddamn this is a good beer. THe peaches are so prevalent and taste. The brett characteristics are spot on and again the peach is so tasty. This beer is dangerous at 10%.

A - Quick-dissolving foam settles to a thin partial collar. Murky peach body.
S - A ridiculous amount of peaches - my notes say 'peaches!' and then later say 'stone fruits'. I guess it smelled a lot like peaches. Not as much brett as you'd expect given its equal billing - more of a lactic yogurty quality. A light vinous note reveals the oak aging.
T - The taste is quite nice, but not as awesome as the aroma. Again, a monstrous amount of peach goodness, mixed with some lactic tangy yogurt flavor, and hint of lemony brett and oak. A tad mono-dimensional, but quite enjoyable.
M - 10%? Are you kidding me? Drinks like a beer with about half the ABV. Smooth texture and lower carbonation - this bottle could have used a tad more spritz and dryness.
D - Perhaps one of the most drinkable 10% beers I've ever had. I really enjoyed this, and probably would consume an entire 750ml bottle if I didn't know there was a monster hangover waiting at the end. I think some age might reveal some added complexity. I liked this a fair bit more than Seizoen Bretta. 1,120 charactersMasterSki, Jun 15, 2012

A: Pours a very hazy yellow color with some floaties (I got some of the dregs). A thick white head forms on the pour and recedes to thick collar that stays throughout.
S: Pure and fresh peach flesh. There is a nice bretty funk with a sugary sweetener type smell. It honestly smells like fruity gummy worms, but in a good way. A little oak and some nice spiced yeast.
T: Peachy flesh, oaky wood. Yeasty spice and some nice tartness. There is a fruity and bretty funk to this. The finish has some musty cobwebs.
M: Medium to light bodied with a nice refreshing finish. There is more mustiness than sourness overall.
O: I would have liked a little a little more tartness and sourness for a wild ale, but it was really nice overall. The fruity sweetness from the peach was really a treat (I really like peaches). Definitely a must try. 930 charactersTreebs, Jun 12, 2012

Huge thanks to Luke (writerljberg) for this special beer. This took gold in the American-Style Brett Ale category at World Beer Cup 2012. My first Logsdon beer. The cap comes off with a vicious hiss. As I put my hands on the keyboard to type that last sentence the foam starts bubbling over the mouth of the bottle and onto my pants. Great move on my part *shakes my fist toward Oregon*. Snifter.
After I typed the word "snifter" I turned around to speak to my fiancé and I knocked 4 ounces of the beer onto my keyboard and mouse pad so I spent 10 minutes cleaning that up. Then, I noticed that foam had gained the mouth of the bottle again and a bit more got on my desk. This beer has been quite an ordeal so far.
The bottle presentation is very nice. The label art itself is beautiful and it has a peach coloring to it that adds to its attractiveness.
A: Hazy yellow orange with a big mousse-like white head. Good retention and sheets of lacing are left behind.
S: Sugary sweet and lightly tart peaches with pronounced leather and earthy notes. Apple blends with pear, apricot, and floral character. Malt is soft and grainy. This smells amazing. There's a subtle spiciness with a restrained barnyard presence.
T: Tart peaches up front with apple, pear, apricot, leather, drying oak, and a little vanilla. The fruit is bright and expressive, with some yogurt-like lactic character. There's a bit of lemon with a mild citric acidity. The finish is bursting with peach and lemon with oak, light tannins, and a dry tartness. This is 10%? Good god. Life is over when brewers can make beers that seem 5% but are actually 10%. 
M: Lower medium body with high carbonation. The mouthfeel is spritzy, dry, tannic, and smooth.
Overall: Exceptional. I feel fortunate to be able to try this. Highly recommended. 1,819 charactersHopHead84, May 28, 2012

Appearance: This gushed quite a bit after uncapping the bottle. The beer pours a hazy blond color, topped by a huge frothy head that takes a while to settle.
Smell: A ton of fruit here. Peaches and cream and vanilla beans spring to mind first. Behind that there's a good amount of barnyard, phenols and light acidity. The nose is exceptional.
Palate: Very dry and bubbly with a big vibrant peach flavor that includes flesh and more tannic skin. Brett lends a peppery, funky and phenolic backbone to the intense fruit flavors. There's a touch of grain and gentle acidity. The body is medium-light, and there's no trace of the ABV. I was even somewhat shocked to discover that this is 10% - I'd have guessed maybe 6%.
Overall: This beer took me by surprise. I tried the base beer for this a few months back and thought it was quite good, but this is on another level. Seek this out. 899 characterslargadeer, May 21, 2012

Batch 2 750ml bottle, number P2024, best by 12/2017. Split into a pair of tulip glasses and shared with TulipSnifter. After lamenting in the forums about how I was unable to find a bottle I had no less than 4 BA's offer one of theirs before receiving a hot tip about where to find one still on the shelf. My faith in humanity is restored. 
Since I gave a well formatted review with batch one I'm going to be a little less technical with this one. I grew up in a rural part of Tennessee and my dad loved to garden. We didn't farm as a way of making money but instead grew fruits and vegetables for our own enjoyment. I hated picking green beans but I loved eating peaches off our six peach trees. 
Sniffing this beer took me back to my childhood smelling those fresh peaches. I don't think I've smelled a peach or apricot beer with a nose as fragrantly fruity as this. A hint if that tangy Brett funks things up too. 
Taste-wise the peach is more delicate but still noticeable. I don't recall batch 1 being all that different from regular Seizoen Bretta except for the addition of the peach and some oak notes. I even said it probably wasn't worth twice as much. This beast on the other hand, has more of that overly ripe Brett and what I think might be some bug juice lending light tartness that I found in Oak Aged Bretta and loved. Although I didn't care for the "American Wild Ale" designation on batch 1, I find it totally appropriate here. 
Really a fantastic beer and worthy of the big price tag. Much improved upon an already excellent first iteration. I'm now an Oregonian so that makes me a homer but I'm really not able to find a single thing I'd like improved on. Logsdon just leapfrogged Upright as my favorite saison producer in the state and there's absolutely no reason not to consider them as one of the best saison brewer's on earth from my perspective.

At the time of this review, this is listed as an American Wild Ale. I mention that because I don't think that's the correct designation. Picked up saison yeast and brettanomyces, but I'm not sure there are any 'wild' bugs in the bottle. Picked up the 750ml bottle at John's Marketplace for $20 a week ago today (the day after it won gold at the World Beer Cup). Flinched for a moment at the price since regular Seizoen Bretta is only $10, but grabbed it anyway since I'm a fan of the style and the brewery. Bottle #P 544 (if that matters) split into a pair of Duvel tulips and shared with TulipSnifter. 
A: Nice pulpy mango puree appearance in the glass, big fluffy white head is a good sign of carbonation for such a high ABV/bottle conditioned beer, minimal spotty lacing. 
S: Peach is instantly noticeable on the nose. Black pepper spice notes and barnyard from the Seizoen Bretta base are also easily appreciated.
T: Bitter peach skin is more apparent than the sweet peach flesh and that's a good thing since it adds a layer of complexity. Good wood, nice funk, cracker base malt. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. No way I would have guessed this a point over 8%. Very dry with minimal residual sweetness. No real discernible sourness. A little tartness is there but I'm attributing that to the natural twang found in the fresh fruit instead of lactic acid. I'd classify this as a fruited saison with brett but not a sour/wild. If there are some bugs in there they haven't manifested themselves yet. 
M: A full silky body with a dry/crisp finish. Appropriate scrubbing carbonation helps with the clean finish. Very well attenuated and exactly what I want in a saison.
O: Grading as a saison, it's very good. I enjoy it a little more than the base beer, but not for twice the cash. Not that price is a problem with this beer. If you saw it on the shelf and didn't buy a bottle, you already missed your chance. Recommended if the opportunity presents itself. 3,895 charactershopsbreath, May 13, 2012
