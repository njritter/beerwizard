L: Beer pours completely dark with 2F light tan head with good retention, lots of lacing, and a cap and ring.
S: Roasty malt and barley goodness, giving off scents like coffee, unsweetened cocoa, and caramel. Tiny deduction for barely noticeable off-note that is mineral in character  (likely the famous HF well water).
T: Lots of roasty goodness that generally follows the nose with slightly sweet coffee and unsweetened cocoa. 
F: Medium bodied, light natural carbonation. Creamy goodness. Excellent construction and balance.
O: Best basic porter I've had. No big frills or added flavor, just solid goodness. 720 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Apr 09, 2017

4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5The beer was opaque and somewhat viscous on the pour. A very dark brown color with a thick and creamy tan head. The first whiff brought milk chocolate with a bit of roasted coffee, some roasty malt, and a tiny bit of char. The malt was slightly sweet and it gave the sensation of chocolate milk. The first thing I noticed on the drink was the incredible silky feel of this one. I mean this beer just flowed effortlessly across my palate. Not thin, not sweet, just right. Carbonation was lower than most ales which seemed perfect for a big porter. The taste was huge dark chocolate, some coffee, some toast, mild char, and a pleasing floral bitterness on the finish. A big, complex beer that approaches imperial stout territory. This beer was 7.2% but I never noticed it. I'm finding out that these HF beers certainly stand up to the hype! 838 charactersBuck89, Mar 19, 2017

Pours a nice black color, or lack of color, with a fine brown head.
Loads of coffee on the nose, with a bit of toast and soy sauce.
Very soft flavor, chocolate and coffee dominate, with hints of toasted bread and salt in he back.
Unbelieveably thick and rich texture considering the ABV. Velvety goodness.
Porters are my least favorite style, but I had heard so many good things, I had to go for it, and very happy I did.  Really rich and velvety, a pleasure to drink. 505 charactersJamFuel, Mar 14, 2017

S: Roasted barley malt, toasted nuts and some earthy hops. 
T: Roasted barley, roasted coffee beans, generic nuttiness. Some cocoa powder and cocoa nibs. Finishes with a piney hop bitterness doing battle with the roasty bitterness. Modest heat noted on the back of the palate from the ABV. This is just a really tasty porter. 
M: Medium in heft - a bit meatier than your standard porter. Carbonation is a bit subdued. 
O: Excellent. Not awe-inspiring with unique flavors or anything "weird." Just a really good porter. 648 charactersKendo, Feb 05, 2017

Ah the American porter. maybe if more people made 'em like this, this category would get a helluva lot more respect. A stunning, gently toasty, nutty, candied sugar (in a subtle way) sweet, smooth baker's chocolate melange of greatness. And the mouthfeel is particularly full and creamy for the style. 338 characters2beerdogs, Oct 25, 2016

Smells of melted chocolate, toasted walnuts, rock sugar and unsweetened marzipan. The nose comes very well together, balanced by a mellow earth note, including a whiff of dough and flowers, adding to the prominent chocolate.
Has an utmost soft mouthfeel, creamy with a medium, malt relying body, featuring a lively carbonation burst, tickling the tongue during the finish.
Tastes of milk chocolate, bitter cocoa nibs, which add to the complexity of the silk chocolate, and toasted hazelnuts. Turns a tad dryer during the mid palate with even more cocoa nibs, a whiff of licorice and lots of soothing cream. Finishes with rock sugar, fudge and bitter chocolate, clean and soft.
Very well built Porter, pleasantly complex without loosing its focus at any point. Intense during the mid palate, while finishing surprisingly soft and calm. 899 charactersaleigator, Oct 22, 2016

Overall a rather good porter that flirts with the stout line.  True to its essence with a strong hoppy profile. 437 charactersAmguerra305, Aug 26, 2016

4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from last year's bottle (late August 2015 bottling date) into a nonic pint. Black as night with a dark tan head makes up the appearance. Once the head fades it is hard to disturb it back to life.
Big aroma after the pour, molasses, chocolate, booze, I'm in for a treat here. Flavorwise this was probably the best porter I've ever had. Huge chocolate malt notes, some espresso bean, big molasses note, raisin, touch of alcohol spice. Thick, chewy body, takes some time to finish this one.
Overall best porter yet. Never had a "dark beer" from Hill Farmstead before this one and I can't believe they are so versatile. Can't wait for the next bottle! 656 charactersBranfordBound, Aug 01, 2016

Distinctive roasted malt flavor, almost exaggerated. And underneath the roast, caramel sweetness. Very clean, nothing muddled. Almost reminds me of fresh un-fermented wort. Probably the thickest mouthfeel of any beer this abv I've ever had also. Pretty wonderful, intense, perfect porter. That said, if you don't like intensely roasty, burnt flavors, this won't be your bag. 470 charactersPDXAmbassador, Jul 27, 2016

Maybe a little spice in there as well. Taste follows the nose with added complexity. Roasted chocolate is the dominant flavor, but there's also some caramel sweetness in there as well. The soft, creamy mouthfeel takes this beer to another level. Great Porter! 373 charactersdaudelin2000, Jul 17, 2016

A slow pour with a slightly agressive finish will generate a beautiful cascading head that forms a light brown foam. The beer sips wonderfully thick and elegantly drops flavors of coffee, raisin, and chocolate in great proportion, delivering complexity without extremity. The finish is a nice, refreshing hop bitterness and a lightness that I'll skeptically attribute to the divine water up at the Hill Farmstead farm...
Wish I had an infinite supply of this beer. 532 charactersschinebd, Jun 04, 2016

Aroma is char and roast, there is also a little booze and herbal notes but the toasty notes dominate.
Taste is smoky, chocolatey and bitter coffee. The roastiness definitely takes over in this beer. It starts sweet and malty in front and finishes with bitter roast.
Mouthfeel is medium, it's thicker than you'd expect for a 7.5% porter nice satisfying mouthfeel.
Overall this beer isn't worth trading anything crazy for, but is definitely worth going out of your way for. If you don't have to give up much for it trade for it. 627 charactersScott17Taylor, May 19, 2016

4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter.  Label says Bottled 04.06.16.
A- Pours a 99% opaque black color with a 1/2 inch light brown head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of sheer surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves small clots behind. 
S- Big roast in the nose brings notes of char, smoke and also some earthy hops.  Also a bit of booze.
T- More smoke plus dark chocolate, char and a hint of vanilla sweetness.  Somewhat bitter but very drinkable.  Bitter roast aftertaste.
M- Soft and silky with medium carbonation and a full body.
O- Just as George, the brown ale, teeters on the brink of porter territory, this teeters on the brink of stout territory.  The only thing keeping it from crossing the threshold is the feel as it's definitely not viscous enough to be classified as a stout.  Also, the malt character, while certainly intense, does not make me think of a stout.  Either way, this is some tasty stuff.  I get a lot of smoke to the point that I'm surprised no smoked malt was used for this beer. 1,100 charactersImmortale25, May 10, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Utterly magnificent beer from Hill Farmstead and ranks second in my book only behind Society and Solitude #5. It is a black oil with a 1.5 finger dusty white head that turns into mocha tan. It smells incredible of dark chocolate and some coffee. The dark chocolate profile is so enduring that it lingers even after the distinct espresso end notes. Complex yet smooth. Would love to always have it at my fingertips. 414 charactersTrevor11, Apr 12, 2016

Look: Very dark. Can't see any light through it. A nice dark brown head is formed leaving very little lacing. 
Smell: Smells like fudge, a tad of vanilla and coffee, and a ton of dark fruits. 
Taste: Very fudgey. Almost as fudgey as Aun Mas Jesus. Dark fruits up front ending with a bit of coffee, caramel and a bit of vanilla. A touch of smoke also. 
Feel: Feels a bit thick for a regular porter but it's not too thick. 
Overall: This beer is fantastic. I had thr BA version last night and enjoyed that even more. This beer is definitely a top 5 porter/stout for me. Hill Farmstead knows their stuff. 650 charactersTHSmusicman, Mar 31, 2016

Taste is big roasty notes with bittersweet chocolate and malts coming together with a Chocolate Riesen candy vibe.  Sweetness subsides and bold roast takes over as it warms up.  Feel is soft and perfect for the style.  Great beer. 349 charactersSaisonRichBiere, Mar 28, 2016

Smell is chocolatey roasted malts and dark ripe fruit. Taste is the same with some coffee flavors, with a perfectly bitter hop finish. Feel is thinner than you expect with such big flavors, but in line with the style. 
Overall, a magnificent beer, well worth seeking out. 412 charactersBeers-es, Mar 17, 2016

Smell: Honestly off-putting at first; slightly astringent; almost earthy. Got better with warmth and developed a roasted, mostly chocolate smell.
Taste: Very light chocolate and coffee tastes. A little smokey; reminded me a little of a tootsie roll's taste.
Feel: So drinkable for a porter. Almost watery; not syrupy at all. Very little bitterness. Not coating.
Overall: Possibly the best porter I've had. Great taste and feel. Worried by the odors at first but everything got a little better with some warmth. 609 charactersdhitchcox, Feb 09, 2016

As someone weaned on dark beer, Everett was mine. So awesome to finally get to try this. Excellent pour, nice creamy head that settles over time but hangs on just enough. Nose was probably my least favorite part of the beer, though it's certainly not awful, just a bit heavy on the roasted malt, so that there's a hint of black marker in the air. Certainly some dark chocolate in there too (and, really, even chocolate can have some interesting aromas/flavors, so, again, hard to fault Everett too much here). Lovely on the palate, supremely because of a superlative body, absolutely perfect balance of rich, creamy decadence and eminent drinkability. Truly masterful. Taste is dark roasted malt, some dark chocolate perhaps, and a goodly acidic kick (this thing gave me some serious heartburn). Overall, really, really well done, that body a real revelation, and the taste pretty darn textbook, although I think it'd do especially well a touch smaller, maybe in the 5.5-6.5% range, just to take that acidic edge off. Otherwise, well done indeed. 1,131 charactersbreadwinner, Jan 11, 2016

(OMG, I'm glad I did!!)   BUT, HF's darker side, this Porter really hit home.  One of the best I've ever had and, like some of my other reviews, I was able to get this in bottles and I find it's a gift that keeps on giving if I dole it out slowly to myself on special occasions.  Drink safely! 546 charactersNewbeergeek1, Dec 27, 2015

Even though there was substantial roast in the nose, the taste and mouthfeel is thick and smooth.  Standard no frills no adjunct porter and it does it pretty well. 369 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 23, 2015

L - Pours pretty dark for a porter.  Definitely black coffee body and tan one finger head.  Looks more like a double stout or RIS.
S - Some sweet and bitter coffee on the opening.  Roasted malts and licorice midway in.  Some smokiness on the ending.
T - Semi-sweet chocolate starts off strong.  Mildly sweet coffee comes through along with vanilla.  The roasted malts show up on the finish.
F - For a porter, medium bodied and low carbonation.  Has a wet finish, really coats the mouth.
O - One of the better porters I've had. 549 characterscvm4, Dec 13, 2015

Tastes like a lots going on here.  Some coffee and caramel hints of nuttiness like slight almond flavor. Very smooth silky mouthfeel too. The mouthfeel is not too thick really perfect.

4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Despite Sean Hill's need for stemware for beers, this was treated as an American styled Porter and poured into a nonic pint glass.
The appearance was dark brown color ranging close to black and having a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Stringy lacing weaves around the glass.
The smell starts off with a sweet to roasty coffee bean and then a delicate roasty cocoa bean. Vanilla slides in for the balance underneath.
The taste involved all of the previously mentioned flavors - warmingly sweet, roasty with subtle bitterness of the coffee beans underneath. An aftertaste of mellow roasty to sweet cocoa beans slides into the finish.
The mouthfeel sat about a medium in body with a good sessionable feel surrounding my tongue. Gentle roasty to bitter harshness does hit my tongue. Carbonation hits my tongue appropriately.
Overall, this is a wonderful American styled porter hitting all of the notes. Of course, I would have this again. 975 charactersBack_in_the_Saddle, Nov 16, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Pearpicker for this bottle!
Poured from a 500ml bottle (bottled 31Aug15) into a pint glass.
LOOK: Pours with a quarter finger's worth of cinnamon foam that shrivels into a khaki line after 5 seconds. Black in color with an orange tint. There are no visisble rising bubbles. Lacing is thin and very subtle.
SMELL: Has strong aromas of sweet chocolate and sugared coffee that entangle with mild aromas of bitter roasted malts and barley along with subtle vanilla and oak aromas.
TASTE: Strong flavors of sweet chocolate enter initially and are immediately followed by mild sugared coffee and bitter roasted malt flavors. Mild flavors of vanilla along with subtle oak flavors follow. Subtle barley flavors and hints of earthy hops (weren't detected in the aroma) finish off the symphony of flavors as all previous flavors persist except for bitter roated malts, which grow slightly stronger.
FEEL: Light-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down incredibly smooth and somewhat creamy (it's too thin to have the full creamy feeling). Ends with the slightest hint of dryness.
NOTE: I am not a fan of bitter at all, but this brew pulled it off incredibly well. With that being said, if the bitterness was toned down, this would taste even more spectacular than it already does. 1,279 charactersMyotus, Nov 09, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass:
Appearance: very dark brown, bordering on black, with a thick, beige head. Lots of retention and lacing, with the head sticking around for awhile. Beautiful beer, perfectly executed.
Aroma: TONS of roast. If Epiphany and Congress St. are the standard bearers for hop aroma, this is the standard bearer for roasted dark malt. So inviting and warm. Layers of milk chocolate and light coffee underneath.
Taste: following the smell, lots of roasted malt, with some bitter chocolate. It's delicate and not overwhelming in sweetness or roastiness. Solid base of malt, but not sweet at all. Some charred, burnt coffee-esque flavor.
Feel: Medium-bodied, with a relatively crisp finish for a porter. The perfect compliment to the flavor and smell, it definitely elevates the brew.
Overall: I try to rate beers based on adherence to style. A 5 to me is literally the perfect embodiment of a style, with anything above 5 being a beer that all others within that style are compared to. This is one of those for porters. It is incredibly complex, delicate, and warming. Excellent! 1,113 charactersTheElectricOne, Oct 24, 2015

Pours a deep brown with amber hues, like maple syrup, but settles into a pitch black color in the glass. Not much head results from the pour, but eventually a half finger of cocoa and khaki-colored foams establishes itself. This eventually becomes a creamy-looking, foamy lace that lingers on. 4.75
Mellow milk chocolate notes, caramel and vanilla seep out, along with a gentle floral bouquet. It's a very gentle, subtle nose, but very appealing. 4.25
As with the nose and as I've found with many Hill Farmstead beers, there's a gentle, even-handed approach to the beer. Nothing over asserts itself here, as the flavors seek more to harmonize and complement one another. Up front is creamy milk chocolate and caramel followed by dark chocolate followed by some light stone fruit. The finish is pleasantly floral with what seems to my tongue to be some lactose and sugar. 4.25
I must say, the pour suggested a thinner beer than how this turns out when on the tongue. It's creamy and full-feeling, while still drinking easy. It has roasted elements, light sweetness, and a perfectly-placed carbonation mid-to-late finish that linger on the tongue creating a satisfying sensation. 4.5
Exceptional. Another artful product from Hill Farmstead. I must tip my hat to this brewery for the true artisanship they display in their beers. Truly incredible. 1,406 charactersONovoMexicano, Oct 21, 2015

Smells like tons of bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, slight hints of vanilla and burnt molasses. Flavor is similar to smells with chocolate, very roasty, finishes bitter, hints of tobacco and licorice. Feels very full and creamy; the mouthfeel maybe the best of any porter I've ever had. Overall a really well made porter that feels more refined and well put together. For me the bitter/spicy finish is little overwhelming and takes over the chocolate and coffee aspects I like about the beer. 545 charactersRaj, Oct 21, 2015

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Description: Appearance is black with only a faint trace of coffee-colored head.  Gives off a smoky, roasted aroma with a chocolate and coffee in the background.  The coffee and chocolate come through more  prominently in the taste, along with smokiness.  Aftertaste is coffee that lingers and complements the rich flavor profile.  It's a thick, almost chewy porter with just a hint of carbonation.  Alcohol is well hidden and not very apparent.
Suggested food pairing: A rich chocolate cake
If you like this beer then you should also try: Victory at Sea Vanilla Coffee Porter
Ideal time to drink this beer: I'm not much of a cigar smoker, but a big, fat cigar would probably pair pretty awesomely with this.
Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again)  If you looked up "Porter" in the dictionary, there should be a picture of this beer.  It's exactly what a porter should be.  Incredibly well balanced, flavorful and rich.  I really don't have any knock on this beer - it's pretty flawless.  The only reason I'm not rating it more highly is that it didn't have a "wow factor" that really blew me away.  That being said, this is still a very well executed, fantastic offering from Hill Farmstead. 1,233 charactersSHDoyle, Oct 18, 2015

The nose is lots of roast, with milk chocolate and coffee sneaking in. Once the beer warms, the chocolate on the nose really starts to pop out. The first sip immediately hits you with a near perfect balance of roasted coffee and chocolate, with just a tad bit of sweetness in the body, before a nice roastyness takes you through the finish. The feel is pretty good, just a tad bit thin for my liking. 490 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Oct 14, 2015

It's a pitch black with a finger width head length of a tan hue. The aroma is one of coconut, booze, and brown sugar. There is a bit of cloying sweetness up front with a light amount of dark chocolate. More chocolate and some coconut later in the mouth with the a finish of more light coconut. It's definitely better as it warms. A very good porter nonetheless. 433 charactersSheppard, Oct 02, 2015

4.75/4.25/4.5/4.75/4.75
A: Black, opaque, with a finger of frothy brown head.
S: It smells like a porter...malty, rich, and meaty. Hint of smoke and roast, but mostly cream. Not as potent as might be.
T/M: Thick and rich, with a potent meaty-rich-syrupy-thick strain running through the middle of it. The malty sweetness and the creamy body hint towards vanilla notes, but the bulk of it is lightly smoky chocolate. The aftertaste is clean, bready coffee grounds.
O: The quintessence of a porter. This is precisely what it purports to be and is meant to be. 642 charactersAgentMunky, Sep 21, 2015

Appears dark black with a nice mocha head. After a few minutes the head has dissolved to a ring of small bubbles.
Taste is rich with notes of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and espresso. This could be an imperial stout if I didn't know any better.
Mouth feel is full bodied and creamy
Overall one of the, if not the best, Porters I've tried. The depth and richness of flavor put this one in a different class than most porters. 471 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Sep 06, 2015

The taste has very good balance with a lingering hop presence to balance the roastiness and chocolate flavor.

L -Beautiful dark black beer with a nice mocha head. 
S - Nose seems to have dropped off a tad but I'm getting roasted dark malts with hints of earthiness and some spicy notes. Some sweeter aromas too. As it warms up, some smokey/umami notes come through.
T - Very drinkable dark roasted malt balanced with some milky/chocolatey/vanilla sweetness. Damn is this good. Finishes with a little bit earthy/spicy notes, but dark roast malts dominate the finish.  Way past the finish I can taste the hops...tastes like the aroma you smell when you visit a hoppy brewery. Super awesome!
F - For a porter, very think mouthfeel. Thicker than a lot of stouts I've had before. Lighter carbonation. 
O - Just an amazing beer that I'm fortunate enough to have tried. Almost drinks like a stout but has some very distinctive porter qualities. Would happily drink this again! Cheers! 920 charactersrockernino, Aug 26, 2015

4.93/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a growler into a tulip, the beer is jet black, with a foamy, dense, low profile, clingy, light tan head. Aromas of rich, roasted coffee, hints of peat, highlights of cocoa nib, and subtle char notes. Very aromatic and bold. Flavors are big and smooth forward, with a solid dose of cocoa nib, bitter roasted coffee, subtle cream undertones, highlights of char and campfire smoke, and a touch of milk chocolate. Amazingly balanced, with a seamless transition between all of the flavor notes. The body is full, smooth, and big, but it completely fits with the profiles of the beer. Richly sweet and heavily roasted aftertaste, with lingering notes of chocolate of coffee. The finish is smooth, dry, and with a delicious linger. This is arguably the best porter I have ever had. 786 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 17, 2015

The aroma offers lots of anise and licorice bitterness, sweet caramel and brown sugar, milk chocolate, coffee grounds, robust porter like roasted malt.
The flavor has an underlying anise bitterness. The transitions and moves on with milk chocolate, creamy mocha, roasted coffee, caramel and brown sugar sweetness, hints of dates and dried dark fruit, touches of burnt bitterness on the finish.
The mouthfeel is creamy and rich for 7.5%, towards beers that are much larger than it. 550 charactersdar482, Aug 13, 2015

Pours a deep brown color with a light brown, finger-sized head.  Moderate retention,  moderate lace
Aromas were of roasted malts, big chocolate flavors
Taste was followed the nose with the chocolate becoming more of a bitter baker's chocolate.  Also picked up notes of coffee as well. Modereate hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel was medium and coating. Clearly, the best attribute of this beer.
Overall, one of the better porters I've had. 478 charactersJamesStreet, Aug 05, 2015

A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a medium dense beige head that fades very slowly and leaves an extremely thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains coffee, roasted malts, some chocolate and a touch of hops.
T: The taste starts out with a strong black coffee flavor followed by some chocolate and maple sweetness. Then a hearty roasted malt character comes in. The hops presence is very mild but quite complementary and creates a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent Porter to drink for a long time. 821 charactersTheManiacalOne, Aug 01, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Wowzers.  Best porter I've ever tried.  Look is great.  Dark, dark brown, thick, nice head, like you expect.  Smell and taste are both tons of chocolate, the typical porter roast, and not too much bitterness and coffee, etc.  So chocolatey and smooth, unlike a lot of "top-end" porters that are really bitter or roasty, and basically just are made to try to stand out from popular stouts.  Nice to find something that actually tastes damn good, rather than just trying to be the best of something no one else does (and therefore automatically the best...yawn).  The mouthfeel was so thick and creamy, I didn't even think about it till now, it was just so perfect.  Like a roasty mocha.  And I get defensive about living 9 min away from Jack's Abby, with their standard-of-the-style Baltic Porter Framinghammer.  But this was just awesome.  
Honestly -- totally honest here -- this was the best HF beer I've had.  And I believe I've had all their beers above 4 on BA multiple times, and many others, as well.  The IPAs, in my opinion, are all (ALL) below many of Tree House's IPAs, and I live closer to them.  So I will pass of the HF hoppy stuff most of the time (yes, I know I am extremely spoiled.  I think about and appreciate that every day of my life :).  But this is the best porter I've ever had, and the best HF beer I've had.  I am re-committed to HF after this.  In-freakin-credible. 1,394 charactersakrz47, Aug 01, 2015

Pours into an HF chalice, dark with a chocolate brown head.  What you expect from a porter.
Smells charred and chocolately.  Dark chocolate, especially, with nodes of coffee that don't taste like they're from coffee so much as they're coffee-like hints you'd pick up from roasted grain.  One of the most pleasantly intense bitter aromas I've ever come across.
Tastes like it smells only more variegated.  Milk chocolate and light roast coffee up front, dark roasted espresso near the middle, dark chocolate at the back.  Intense and wonderful throughout without ever becoming unbalance to too strong.
This is turning out to be the year of the porter for me.  On the sweet side is Tributary's otherworldly Porter, and toward the bitter end is Everett.  It might not be trendy enough to rank among HF's more desirable beers, but Everett is as good as they come. 886 charactersmynie, Jul 25, 2015

S - A full, complex roast nose, with big chocolate and coffee elements, coupling with a strong molasses bread note.  This just makes me want to go in for a drink.
T - Delivering on the nose, with an open of strong roasted malts, full of coffee and bread, leading to a middle with slightly more acidity and smoke and savory highlights, closing with a solid bitter finish that clears the flavors perfectly.
M - Full, with a nice weight on the tongue that indicates the beers presence, coupled with decent carbonation to keep the fullness from becoming cloying.  No real drying on the close.  Incredibly well balanced.
O - I have finally met a 5.0 beer.  A beer that lines up perfectly with the expectations I have for a porter, and delivers both precise balance and nuanced flavor notes that make drinking both extraordinarily rewarding and a genuine pleasure.  Brewers would do well to take note of the beauty, simplicity and depth this beer achieves.  Illustration no. 1 that all beers do not have to take it to 11. 1,204 charactersTsar_Riga, Jul 10, 2015

Look: Black, opaque, with a slight reddish-brown hue on the edges.  Nice head, tan colored though dissipates rather quickly.  Lacing is decent though also doesn't linger too long.  Looks like your standard porter.
Smell:  Incredibly pleasant, sweet chocolate obviously comes to mind.  Hints of sweetness and just a touch of alcohol can be picked out.  What separates this one for me is that sweetness, though.  Very pleasant aroma.
Taste:  Chocolate is what really comes to mind here, like a 95% cocoa chocolate, which lends a nice bitterness to the beer.  This is balanced by a sweetness.  Also there are excellent hints of smoke, not detected on the nose initially.  These notes are present yet not overpowering.  Overall an incredibly balanced brew.
Mouthfeel: Malt lends an astringency, which I find enjoyable.  Other than that it is quite smooth with adaquate carbonation for the style.
Overall: An incredible porter, hard to say if it's the best I've ever drank without side-by-side comparision but can say with confidence its definately up there.  Will definately be making a trip up to VT soon for another fill of this one. 1,183 charactersedward_boumil, Jun 29, 2015

The flavor is silky and decadent. Roasty malt, coffee, cocoa powder and Hershey's syrup. It just keeps unfolding and unfolding. As big, bold and complex as some boozier BA treatments. But still has that signature HF balance. Superior porter here. 358 charactersjjdc, Jun 21, 2015

First pour is amber brown, quickly becomes almost purely opaque, dark as night. A solid 1-inch mocha head forms, featuring 100s of tiny bubbles, and while it doesn't stick around forever, it manages to retain itself quite well with lots of sticky lacing. While this should have been drunk when it was much more fresh, the nose still produces ample roast coffee & cocoa notes, leaving no doubt to the sweet nature of the brew. Flavor-wise, it features the perfect amount of sweetness, reminds me of the hint of vanilla soy from a Starbucks drink, closing in on mocha rich. Finish produces that moderately bitter coffee bite, but it all works, in fact, it's perfect. On top of all that, the mouthfeel is unparalleled for a non-BA, sub-8%, porter. Incredible beer. Quite likely the best "regular" porter I've ever had. 888 charactersmarkgugs, Jan 30, 2015

4.7/5  rDev +5.1%Such a mindblowing porter. Dark black with a great lacing, strong aromas of coffee and earthy hop bitterness, lots of grapefruit citrus. Taste shows cranberry, dark malts and a really robust dark malt profile, smooth coffee and dark chocolate provoke, a gentle carbonation from the growler. A lingering finish with citrus rind, piny forest with a herbal edge. Very full body with a really rich creamy mouthfeel but also a quite assertive bitterness. Espresso, licorice, black molasses, grapefruit citrus, smoky woody character matched by a creamy body and an upfront bitterness. A very flavourful porter, and matched by its great body and balance, delicious and certainly of the most aromatic and well made porters I've tried. 726 charactersmick303, Nov 24, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -4.9%Bottle.  Dark brown with a mocha head.  Nice roasted malt aromas.  Easy drinking with a really good mouthfeel and body.  Rich roasted malt notes with mellow caramel, chocolate, toffee, and expresso undertones.  Honestly, I prefer an imperial stout to a porter 99 out of 100 times.  However, this is a very fine ale and an exception to the rule.  One quick side note, this bottle had a bit of age on it so the hop characteristics were diminished.  This is one HF beer that lives up to the hype... 495 charactersdboon, Sep 19, 2014

A - Dark as night, ebony wood, wonderful mocha cap can be coaxed from a vigorous pour.
S - Bakers chocolate, hint of smoke, cocoa and toffee, just beautiful.
T - Roasted grains, a bit of Madagascar chocolate note, deep grains and a surprising raspberry buried deep in there.
F - Silky is the primary observation. Finish is a bit oily, and the complete palate coverage never ends.
O - A wonderful porter, in the Danish model, super body and flavor.

4.3/5  rDev -3.8%Appearance: It has a nice jet black color to it. It has a nice creamy tan head that dies down moderately slow and leaves some nice lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of loads of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, faint smoke and some dark fruit. 
Taste: Like the aromas, it has a loads of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, some vanilla, some smokiness and some sweet dark fruit in the back. 
Mouthfeel: It has a low-med carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel. 
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas. Another solid beer from Hill Farmstead.

Location: Growlers Beer Bistro
Glassware: Sniffer
Appearance: Black in color. Towards the edges the beer has a reddish tinge. Tan to milk chocolate colored carbonation. Full long lasting head. Great retention. Good cling cause a very nice cascading appearance. 
Aroma: Chocolate malts. Coffee grinds sweet chocolates and battering chocolates. No hop aroma.  
Flavor: Way more flavorful then the aroma lets on. Chocolate Malts. Toast. Really nice chocolates flavors. Just a touch of sourness. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body. Medium carbonation. 551 charactersKornWallace, Aug 27, 2014

S: The nose is probably the best thing about this exceptional beer. Vanilla, caramel, coconut, dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, graham cracker. 
T: At first, I get bitter coffee-like notes and sweet lactose. Toffee, chocolate and vanilla/oak. The finish has the traditional earthy hop presence of a robust porter with a slight alcohol tinge.  The hops are kept in check by the sweet chocolate notes.
M: Decadent. Extremely smooth and creamy, but very very drinkable. 
O: the best porter I've had the pleasure of trying. As the beer warms, different flavors are accentuated, and so I looked forward to each sip.  I need to seek this out again. 690 characterssnowmageddon, Aug 25, 2014

4.71/5  rDev +5.4%Got this special for our 1,000th review, a Hill Farmstead seemed the right brew for the occasion. Enjoyed from a Growler.
A - Black with a thin brown halo.  Creamy dark khaki head with great retention and ok lace.
S - Porridge, plum, touch of booze, graham cracker, and an edge of vanilla.
T - Chocolate, marshmallow, plum, cream, oats, and warm oaky booze.
M - Outstanding mouthfeel.  Silky smooth with a creamy, medium full body.  
O - I'd call this a Belgian Porter.  A boozy and fruity example of the style.

S- Chocolate and roasted malts. Some hop presence.
T- Chocolate and Roasted malt goodness. A little hot on the finish. Some vanilla and Coffee in there too. Tasted somewhere between a porter and Russian Imperial (and closer towards a RIS). As it warmed the flavors really started to come out.
M- Full bodied no doubt. Very creamy. Absolute perfection here. 
O- So much great flavor going on here. It's too bad this is a hard one to get. Vermonters are so damn lucky. Totally enjoyed it, though it seemed to be less a porter than RIS. 620 characterschrishiker1409, Aug 02, 2014

Dark brown/black pour with head reducing to ring of lacing. Sweet, roasty malts, chocolate, coffee, a hint of dark fruit and slightly tart. Finishes with some bitter hop presence. The balance of sweetness, bitterness, tartness and richness of flavor pushes my buttons in the right way. Creamy, viscous and oily mouthfeel but not thick. Very easy drinking. A fine fine porter and an awesome beer. Love it. 428 charactersbrianmandell, Jul 31, 2014

Thin caramel-colored head quickly dissipated. Smell was subtle roast malt with hints of chocolate. The taste in awesome... decadently sweet chocolate with balanced flavor from the roast malts. The columbus hops also keep the chocolate sweetness from being too overpowering. Easily my favorite porter. 389 charactersDawgboned37, Jul 28, 2014

Nose is roasty and chocolatey with a hint of lactose. Taste follows nose with a slight smokiness and a light hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation and a slightly silky finish. Overall, an amazing porter with a great balance and flavor profile.

I'm not the biggest fan of porters. I enjoy them, but they never wow me. This one WOWed me. Everett is pitch-perfect. Great nose, great taste. The mouthfeel is so rich and creamy. I drank it while eating the meat flatbread I ordered, and the two paired so very well together. 
Can't wait to head up to Hill Farmstead and get myself a growler of Everett! 542 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Jul 08, 2014

Appearance: Pours a dark brown with 2 fingers of a darker tan head with good retention. Once in the glass the body is opaque and nearly black.
Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and faint notes of caramel sweetness, smoke and earth.
Taste: Same as the aroma. Malt sweetness hits right upfront followed by dark chocolate, roasted malt, earthy hops and a mild bitterness that comes through in the finish and aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Fully bodied, with a thick creamy mouthfeel and medium fine carbonation. Much fuller feel than I would expect from a 7.5% beer.
Overall: My first Hill Farmstead beer and I'm not disappointed. This is definitely an excellent porter, though it's not so much better than some of it's easier to obtain counterparts that it warrants going to great lengths to obtain. 851 charactersJonada, Jul 07, 2014

Thick, smooth and creamy, Everett is an easy drinking porter. It doesn't have an overwhelming alcohol taste which is good if you plan to drink multiple glasses -- with a slightly bitter taste, this brew is roasty, with a hint of lingering chocolate notes. 333 charactersQSugar2016, Jun 10, 2014

Excellent version of a porter. Bittersweet chocolate, roast and coffee flavors abound. Mouthfeel is just right for style, not super full, but distinguishable from a stout. My second experience with a Hill Farmstead beer, first being Double Citra. Can say I've never been disappointed yet. Wonderful beer. 359 charactersDad_of_Rad, Jun 09, 2014

4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bought this growler on Thursday at the brewery- now that we are back from vacation I am sitting here on Sunday night enjoying this brew with my husband. Poured into a Sam Adams lager glass-which I feel has a more ideal shape than a standard pint glass
A- Body appears obsidian in soft lighting allowing no light to pass through even when held up to the light-in aggressive lighting it takes on more of a black coffee tone but still allows little if any light to pass through. Pours with a 1-2 finger latte colored head. The head grows slightly after the initial pour and fades to one finger trapping aroma and leaving traces of lacing all the way down the glass. 
S- Dark malt, chocolate, vanilla, oats, and a touch of roasted malt overtones.
T- Initial flavor is somewhat mild and offers hints of dark chocolate and vanilla and smooth rich malt. There is a balanced roasted malt bitterness and maybe a touch of floral hops that meet the initial smooth rich flavor. Left to linger is a perfect balance of all the flavors aforementioned.
M- Almost unbelievable. My husband initially described this brew as "too smooth." Yes, there is a low carbonation and a medium to heavy weight rich, smooth, and creamy body. 
O- Overall this is one of the best porters I have had. This is a new "gold standard" porter for me. It is a very smooth and well balanced beer that doesn't really have anything aggressive, experimental, or over the top. It really shouldn't be anything special in theory-but the quality and class of this brew are top notch. 1,540 charactersPittBeerGirl, Jun 07, 2014

Smells fairly sweet, lots of chocolate with a bit of coffee. Maybe a tiny bit of hops and fruit, with a subtle kick from the medium ABV.
Taste begins super sweet and malty with notes of chocolate, before transitioning to a very nicely balanced hop bitterness that leads into roasted coffee flavours. The finish is the slightest bit dry but still extremely smooth with lingering, sweet toffee and malt notes.
The body is thick, but on the lighter side. Overall, a nearly perfect representation of a porter. 628 charactersIan_B, Jun 03, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6.3%I enjoyed this during our birthday stout tasting, enjoyed chilled from the growler purchased at the Brewery in a stout glass.
 The color is dark brown almost black with thick beige cap with fine bead. The aroma is strong with malt and roasted aroma with a slight fruit and sweet cookie-like scent with mild cocoa and vanilla qualities. The feel is a bit on the sweeter side, but roasted presence is there with a nice roastd middle and medium carbonation with semi-dry smooth finish.
The taste is pretty outstanding I would say more impressive than that it just oozes the malt flavor with low roast and subtle caramel in the background with a light spice and very mild alcohol with sligth dark cocoa flavor as it finishes. Overall this is one of my favorites of this style and in the realm of all-time-favorite beers for me, exceptional in every way. 851 charactersSlatetank, May 27, 2014

This is an amazing beer and I can not understand why it is not in the Top 250. I t is way more than your usual porter. It is pitch black, under the blankets dark; with the sticky lacing that tells you "This is going to be really Good."
My second time having Everett, but this time I was sitting in a pub with time to kill, and time to fully enjoy this Best Porter Ever beer. Before I was hustling around the Boston Extreme Beerfest from one station to the next and did really get the chance to savor all that this beer has to offer. It is AWESOME!!! 741 charactersricknelson, May 27, 2014

Pours pitch black with a 1/4 inch khaki espresso head that dissipates quickly but remains thin through to finish. Minimal lacing is left behind in my pint glass but that's okay.
Smell is complex and robust. Coffee, Chocolate, oak, char, vanilla, toffee, even some spicy pepper notes (could be my sinus' though with Spring allergy) backing dark fruit and faint booze & hop resin.
Taste follows the nose well. This beer awakens once warmed for 10 minutes. My first cold sips were muted but the chocolate and vanilla, booze, toffee become more pronounced when nearing room temp. The faint pepper zing dances on tongue for a few seconds after swallowing and I'm left with a nice biscuit, booze, and malt presence. 
Mouthfeel...hands down the best I've ever experienced....Just ahead of Imp Biscotti BBA. So very silky smooth with just enough carb to keep things interest without being overbearing.
Overall this is the best representation of a style I've ever encountered and the best non BBA beer I've ever had. These guys are definitely the mark for most every style they produce. 1,183 charactersoldmankoch, May 22, 2014

A: Rich coffee, caramel, and melanoidins with some gentle earthy hops. A nice dark fruit character, some malty breadiness, and soft fruity esters round this beer out. A very soft and rich aroma.
T/M: Smooth bitterness and coffee and chocolate malt flavors take the front, moves into rich caramel and melanoidins with some soft earthy hops. The body is full and the carbonation soft, allowing the flavors to strike perfect balance for a long savory finish.
Overall, an amazing beer. By no means is this to style, much to strong and much to different, but it is one of the most delicious dark beers I have ever tasted. It is very much like a strong Doppelbock hybridized with a Robust Porter. The flavors are soft and rich, and the bitterness and mouthfeel provide perfect balance. Hill Farmstead has blown me away. 963 charactersSiriusfisherman, May 15, 2014

Pours jet black with a beautiful brown mocha head
Smell is a little underwhelming. Getting some toasted malts and chocolate.
Taste more than makes up for the smell. You get hit immediately with dark chocolate followed by some dark fruits and a finish that I can only describe as that which comes from drinking well water. It's a cleaner, slightly mineral/earthy taste that just doesn't come from processed city water.
Carbonation is perfect and mouthful is very silky.
All in all this is the best porter I've ever had. Can only imaging how off the charts this would be BBA. It almost reminds me of a well aged founders imperial stout lite (highest compliment I can give to a straight stout/porter as aged it's my favorite RIS). My first ever offering from HF and it did not disappoint. 806 charactersmj81, May 05, 2014

A- Dark roasty black with medium to medium large lacing, dark coffee in color. No legs creepin
S- Kinda bland here compared to the taste. I am getting in order-&gt; dark fruits and fig&gt;chocolate&gt;malty backbone
T- Chocolate comes first followed by dark fruits and malt backbone after that. Great taste going on here. There is def a diff, haha, in taste between a well done porter and a well done stout. Lighter on taste, a little more dark fruit IMO
M- Almost perfect here, creamy; perfect amount of carb. Very well done. This might be my favorite HF offering along with BG&E (obvious that I have not conquered the HF world). 
O- A terrific brew, almost perfect for a porter. Highly highly recommended. 730 charactersgueuzedreg, May 03, 2014

Look - Sits a dark black with a slight red hue around the edges when held up to the light. Small soapy head dissipates quickly but leaves an abundance of lacing.
Smell - Slight roasted malts prominent. Coffee. Some semisweet chocolate. Rich and inviting. Faint hops.
Taste - Rich creamy chocolate and coffee followed by a perfectly balanced roasted malt and a dash of hops.
Mouthfeel - Medium-heavy body but smooth as hell, medium carbonation. So creamy. Rests a fading tasty bitter roasted malt with coffee and chocolate. So drinkable.
Overall - Easily one of the best if not the best porters ever. 695 charactersJMScowcroft, Apr 26, 2014

4.89/5  rDev +9.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 750 mL growler into a HF stemmed tulip. The growler was obtained on 3/01/2014 from the brewery, and consumed on 3/03.
A- Jet black with a molasses brown hue at the edge of the glass. The small tan head from the pour recedes quickly, leaving minimal lacing. This is a beautiful beer and hits all of the visual cues that my brain is looking for in a porter. I suppose a tiny bit more head/lacing could make this a perfect 5, but I'm reaching here!
O- Wow. Just absolutely wonderful on all accounts. Fresh malted barley with a beautiful medium roast. Neither overwhelming nor faint, this one is just right. It's hard to imagine a better smelling porter.
T- Up front, it's pure malty, roasty goodness. As the mild sweetness fades, the coffee flavor starts to pick up, reaching a quite lovely combination of malt and mocha. Coffee dominates the finish, bringing on a satisfying light bitter quality that makes you crave another sip.
M - Silky smooth, this beer is not as heavy as I expected. There's minimal carbonation, yet it still feels light on the tongue. It's a bit surprising, as its not as syrupy as I expected, nor as dry. The alcohol is quite well hidden, as is the case with most HF beers.
O - Simply the best porter I have ever had. Absolutely astounding purity. I've had this on tap and from a growler, and it did not disappoint. If you are a fan of porters, I highly recommend you seek this out! 1,423 charactersTychoNDC, Feb 28, 2014

In a tulip the beer was black. There was a small, café au lait colored head with a smattering of lace.
Aroma of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt.
Complex taste. One minute I'm tasting sweet chocolate, the next minute dark chocolate, then espresso.
A wonderful combination of bitter and sweet. Medium-bodied.
I could drink this forever. 462 characterslordofthewiens, Feb 23, 2014
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark brown from the growler, black in the glass. Beautiful lacing from a nice head for the style, very dark brown with good retention.
Aroma is of coffee beans, barley, dark malts, and cream. Not a particularly complex or overpowering nose, but nice and relaxing.
Taste follows the nose, highlighting big coffee notes, a sweet creaminess, a hint of grape-like booze, dark malts, dark fruit, earthy hop bitterness, and chewy wheat.
In a lot of stouts and porters with a full mouthfeel, "chewy" is the nom de jour typically sought after; here, "creamy" seems so much more appropriate. Full, robust, creamy, luscious; pick your favorite. I can't imagine improving on the mouthfeel.
Interestingly, I like this beer anywhere from refrigerator to cellar temperature; once it warms to room temperature, the bitterness and coffee flavor become a little too dominant for my tastes, and you lose out on the delicious creaminess. 930 charactersRoguer, Feb 23, 2014

7.5% abv
Appearance: Oh my god. Jet Black. Little to no head at all. Held up to the light and it was like a total eclipse. 
Not a glimmer of light made its way through this beer. Little, almost no lacing. 
Aroma: Dark chocolate. Bitter chocolate. Dark roasted malts. No hop aroma. Cacao, cocoa nibs, 
all the best things dark. Faint chocolate syrup at the tail end. Really have to reach for the 
sweetness but it’s there. Hershey’s syrup? Can’t wait to try it.
Taste: So tasty. Light bitterness that I’m hoping doesn’t overshadow the perfect chocolate. Hershey’s syrup with bitter chocolate on the finish. Can’t stop drinking this. The bigger the sips, the more the sweetness comes through. Small sips and the bitterness shines through. What’s your cup of tea? Go for it! 
Mouthfeel: Silky smooth mouthfeel. No carbonation but such a silky smoothness that it doesn’t matter. Would have been ruined by too much carbonation. This beer slides right down the pipe. Not overpowering but not so light that you don’t think you’re drinking a real beer.
Overall this is exceptional. Is there a better beer out there in this style? Yes there is because I’ve had several other Hill Farmstead and Cigar City but my word this is good. There isn’t a bad thing that I can say about it. Drool. I wish I could get this year round. What a perfect beer. Thanks Shaun! 1,432 charactersThreeLions, Feb 08, 2014

A- Dark brown with a mocha color head of about 1 finger. Silky lacing
S- Intense chocolate, vanilla, caramel, earthy hops
T- Follows nose well, but even more of a sweet milk chocolate punch. Toffee, sweet lactose, and subtle hints of coffee. Are you kidding me with this roasted perfection and balance?Layers come at you in waves that takes this malty goodness into another level of complexity. Snappy bitter finish immediately turns smooth.
M- It doesn't get much better than this. Full body, creamy, and viscous. Has the feel of a much stronger stout. 
O- Outstanding. Best porter I have had to date. You could easily pair this with a desert dish, but this is one bad ass beer that should probably be enjoyed by itself.
Not 100% sure, but I believe it retails for about $8 for 22oz bomber. 843 charactersBosoxfan20, Jan 25, 2014

Appearance- Black as night with real quick half finger mocha head that left some lacing. Real dark beer here.
Smell- Very roasty. Coffee, chocolate, touch of hops, roasted malts. Pretty standard porter aromas.
Taste- Oh boy. Chocolate, coffee, licorice, cinnamon, dark stone fruits, vanilla. One of the most flavorfull porters I've ever had. Reminds me of an unsmoked Fear and Trembling. So good.
Mouthfeel- So smooth. Rich and creamy mouthfeel with medium-light carbonation. Super light hint of booze. Easy drinking.
Overall- Sitting here on a very cold snowy day, this is exactly the beer I was looking for. This will keep you warm in the darkest nights. Quite incredible and hands down the best porter I've ever had. 828 charactersSeanniek91, Jan 21, 2014
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Another awesome beer from Rutager this past summer. Wonderful box man. Cheers! 
From a 50cl bottle into a snifter
21 Plato 
APPEARANCE: Pours out black, slightly clear, yielding a 1+ finger, medium looking, light tan head with good retention. Black body with higher levels of carbonation. Head slowly fades to a thick, full wisp and sticks to the sides of the glass. A half wisp remains and leaves some nice lacing down the glass. Really good looking. 
SMELL: Roasted aromas, sweet cream and vanilla with coffee, espresso, milk chocolate and light caramel notes. Some nuts on the nose too. Great, but not quite as impressive as the taste. 
TASTE: Yes. Roasted flavors, milk chocolate and sweet caramel laced with vanilla cream up front. A big and persistent finish of sweet cream and milk chocolate, roasted grain, bitter espresso and coffee notes. Really delicious. Wonderful. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy and silky on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly mouth-coating. Good feel for sure. 
OVERALL: This is phenomenal. An exceptional beer that really crosses the boundaries between porter and stout, and I'd probably put it in the later category if pushed. Lots of great flavors and aromas with a solid, creamy feel to support it all. Something worth seeking out if you can. Thanks again Rutager. Highly recommended. 1,385 charactersJeffo, Jan 21, 2014

Since I'll probably never see this beer again in these parts, I should probably review it. These notes are NOT from memory. These notes were made while I was drinking the beer. 
Everett Pours a thick oily black color with no highlights. The CCB Brewpub isn't the brightest brewpubs around but I could tell that Everett was a solid coal black colored beer. On top of this pitch black brew was a beautiful thick and creamy mocha colored head of foam. Great retention that left behind a solid string of mocha rings and streak after streak of beautiful lace. 
Everett smells like what a good roasted Porter should smell like. The aroma was thick and roasted with roasted malt, a drop of roasted coffee, a nice medium sized whiff of dark chocolate, a mild scent of smoke, and a speck of black cherry in the finish. When it warms up, the smoke comes out a little more but it doesn't conquer the roastedness of the beer. 
The taste mirrored the aroma. There wasn't much separating the two. No hidden surprises or anything like that. Everett was a roasted Porter (like it should be) with a very good roasted slight smoky taste of roasted malts, some dark roasted coffee beans, plenty of dark chocolate, a drop of smoke, and a subtle black cherry taste at the finish line. An extremely well done Porter. 
I thought the beer's roastedness would give this beer a super dry aftertaste, but it really didn't. HF managed to keep the roastedness but not the dryness. Well done! The aftertaste was roasted but not really dry with more roasted malt, dark chocolate, smoke, and coffee beans. The roasted aspect of the aftertaste sticks around for a while. Good thing I got a glass of water nearby. 
This is one beer that I've been trying to get my hands on for a while after trying it in line at a bottle release. Thanks to the CCB Brewpub for giving me that chance. It lives up to its reputation. An extremely well made Porter from Vermont. Would I drink it again? I sure would! In fact, I ordered another glass. 2,095 charactersAltBock, Jan 16, 2014

A. It is pure black with a dark tan head. With the pour there wasn't much of a head, so not much lacing, but you can tell that if you poured it straight in it would leave much lacing behind.
S. It has a not-overbearing nutty and malty scent.
T/M. There's a strong dose of chocolate that comes through at first. The alcohol is strong; full bodied. Very, very rich. It's carbonated and tingly on the palate, with a long finish. Mild grassy taste and a hint of caramel sweetness.
O. It's a very complex, delicious brew. A truly fantastic porter. 597 charactersAmalak, Jan 10, 2014

verett
A-	Pours nearly pitch black with no head at all, no fizz, nothing. Looks like a cup of coffee 
S- Very complex nose that includes lots of chocolaty malt, slightly smoky campfire, charcoal, raisin and prune. The chocolate notes just continue throughout, reminiscent of a nutty piece of chocolate fudge 
T- The complexity continues to the flavor. Rich roasted chocolaty malt with big notes of coffee and dark fruit with some nutty hazelnut. Smoky notes add a slight bitterness and charred woodsy flavor, the finish picks up some herbal notes with more coffee and chocolate on the linger that seems to last forever 
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slick mouthfeel and silky finish. Drinks efortlessly for a 7.5% ABV 
O- This is my first HF beer and I was weary of all of the hype, but this was an awesome porter. I had a growler and it had lost some carbonation, so I’d love to try the bottled version. Nontheless, this was a great intro to HF and I look forward to trying more. 1,062 charactersTreyliff, Jan 03, 2014

Big thanks goes out to Ryan for this one! Everett is black on top of black. There's no light shining through this beer. The chocolate brown head forms a nice cascade effect when poured hard and settles into a rich creamy cap. The head leaves some thin but sticky lace down the glass. One handsome beer. 
The nose is dense with moderate roast coffee, a touch of hazelnut, and a couple drops of cream. A lactic sweetness adds to the whole overall cup o' coffee experience. Anise adds some black licorice qualities while roasty grains seem to make up the foundation. There's even a tendril of smoke. Sometimes there is a roastiness in beer that comes across as smokey to me but also a little like burnt rubber. While that roastiness is present in this beer it's very faint but I can't help but notice it. There's good depth but it's very subdued, even after warming.
The flavor profile is much more expressive. High cocoa dark chocolate and coffee leap from the glass. That hazelnut and drop of cream, that's close to vanilla, are back and the anise plays a larger role than the nose suggested.I'm not a huge black licorice guy. The chocolate and coffee are rich. I still, unfortunately, get a hint of that burnt rubber on the swallow. It's faint but there, luckily chocolate and roast push it aside and linger.
Active carbonation pushes a body that's a notch below dense to the point of near frothiness. The weighty body is creamy upfront and pushes through to that frothiness. A soft and appreciated roasty bitterness lingers on the swallow. A touch of residual sugar sticks around for a second before drying up. Nicely done!
Everett is a damn fine porter from Hill Farmstead. There's a good depth of flavor and the body is spot on. I wish the nose was a little more expressive but that's just me being picky. While I thoroughly enjoy this porter, and would drink it again, I think I'd reach for either Revolution's or Founder's versions first. Six packs help. Thanks again for the sample, Ryan, appreciated! 2,025 charactersjoe1510, Dec 15, 2013

There are definitely better porters out there, but this one does the trick. Nothing special at all. 352 charactersvinny21bal, Nov 25, 2013

(A)- Pours practically pitch black in color with some tan froth that dissipated quickly.
(S)- Quite rich and deep, even for a porter. Mountains of raisin and coffee grounds with a subtle kick of sweet vanilla. A superb underlying roasted quality to this that makes the coffee aromas very striking.
(T)- Quite similar to the smell. An excellent roasted quality with coffee and cocoa. Hints at a smoky licorice and vanilla on the finish that I am really enjoying right now.
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. Definitely one of the more robust porters I have had in recent memory. Just a superb roasted quality to the malts.
(O)- A world class porter in every way. It is also perhaps one of the strongest porters I have had as well, but that is the way I like them. 838 characterssweemzander, Oct 30, 2013

Bottom Line: I recently wrote a not-very-nice review about Hill Farmstead's Edward Pale Ale, which I felt did not even approach the expectation generated by its hype. Combined with my experience at the brewery itself, I was ready to write the entire experience off. That being said, I like the Everett Porter quite a bit. I mostly like it because it is refreshing with a crisp mouthfeel and a nice flavor that does not linger. This is the kind of beer that you finish a glass of without even realizing how much you've already had.
A: Dark beer. Extremely dark brown, if not black, with a thin 1cm , caramel-colored head. A quick swirl shows that it runs off the side of the glass rather quickly. The head leaves a beautiful, small bubbled glistening effect on the sides of the glass as it runs down.
S: Light, refreshing, coffee notes. An subtle, underlying level of alcohol vapors.
T: Refreshing coffee flavor that does not overwhelm or underperform. There is something else here that I can't quite place - something sour, oily, or syrupy but not quite hoppy, sweet, or citrusy. Not quite two-dimensional in flavor, but maybe 1.5-dimensional, in a nice way with a nice coffee aftertaste that does not overstay its welcome
M: Low carbonation. Initially thin mouthfeel, that has a nice stickiness to it that causes the beer to feel a little syrupy on the sides of your mouth. I really like it.
Overall: I recently wrote a not-very-nice review about Hill Farmstead's Edward, but I think the Everett is pretty good. It is amazingly refreshing, with crisp flavors that are in no way cloying. 1,711 characterstkdchampxi, Oct 20, 2013

A: Silk, black, oily with a caramel mocha head. Perfect.
S: Chocolate, coffee, whisky, and oak.
T: Spot on porter. As with the smell, the coffee flavor is the most powerful and the balance of roasted malts, hops, along with the mouthfeel make this superb.
M: Perfect creamy, thick mouthfeel one would expect from Hill.
O: This is, by far, the best porter or stout I've ever had the pleasure of trying and I suspect it's up there on all counts. This was the first non-hoppy beer from Hill that I got to try on tap back in the winter at Parker Pie Co., in West Glover, Vt., and did it blow me away. Execution down to a minute detail as has become the trend from Hill. Try it if you can. 791 charactersBTVflatlander, Oct 18, 2013

Mouthfeel is organic earth-touched-by-coffee/chocolate. World class.

Pours dark dark brown, almost black. Little carbonation.
Smell is big coffee and chocolate, sweet malts, slightly bitter roast. Really nice interplay of the sweet and bitter. Fantastic.
Taste was smooth coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, slightly sweet creamy flavor. Really good, though not quite as noteworthy as the nose.
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, low carbonation, on the lighter side of medium bodied.
I wish the mouthfeel was a bit thicker or a bit more carbonated. Other than that though, no real complaints. A truly impressive porter that lived up to its reputation. 627 charactersrodkin, Oct 18, 2013

Pouring this into the glass, wow. So dark and the head appeared to be a dark ginger caramel color.
Smell was piney and roasted malt, really nice combination in this porter.
Taste was fantastic, big, bold, in your face, some substantial bitterness, coffee, some chocolate.
Mouthfeel was good, on the thinner side, mild carbonation.
Overall Everett demands your attention. This is a finely crafted and substantial porter. Delicious. 504 charactersBoldRulerVT, Oct 17, 2013

Looks like a pretty straightforward porter. Sexy, viscous, dark body with a fair 1cm white head that dissipates slowly. I can tell this is a well-carbonated beer. A bit of lacing throughout which sticks around. Outstanding, looks great. Pretty much like Black Butte or Edmund Fitzgerald.
Smells intensely roasty. I love the nose on this beer. Its very rich, roasty and quite hoppy. There's a nice bit of espresso bitterness in there mixed in with some dark chocolates. It's very strong, somewhat complex and balanced. 
Oh hell yes. This is the most intense, complex yet balanced porter I've ever had. It has a ton of sweet milk chocolate, espresso bitterness, roast barley malts. There is even a dash of vanilla here. Pretty much everything I could ever want in a porter. All of these flavours meld together so well despite all being so intense, which is the real key to this beer. Ridiculously awesome.
Mouthfeel is fantastic. Lots of porters are fairly thin-medium bodied, but this is solidly medium-full bodied. It is substantial and has that creamy, full Hill Farmstead mouthfeel. I'm not surprised that this is 7.5% ABV given how much flavour and body is in this beer, but I don't get any burn on this beer. While it is full bodied and hefty, it remains just right in terms of carbonation and roasty finish. 
Best American porter I've ever had. It's the best in the style, no question which is why I give it a 5 overall. Hill Farmstead seems to really define the best of the styles I've had so far, especially pale ales and porters. I'm looking forward to trying some of their saisons and stouts, if I ever get my hands on some! 1,846 charactersStevedore, Oct 07, 2013

4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Deep dark brown with a thick almost meringue-like dark sandy colored head. The head is persistent and creamy texture. A little bit of sediment settles on the bottom after a few minutes (poured the entire body into a CBS snifter.)
The smell is fresh light roast coffee, dark chocolate, cola, vanilla. 
It's quite possibly the best tasting beer I've had and certainly the best porter. The coffee flavors are smooth, light berries, slightly acidic. Again with the chocolate only it's sweeter than in the smell. The vanilla is a light accent. 
Soft, smooth body with a creamy texture, like a pillow on the tongue. Light carbonation.
It's nothing short of amazing. The coffee flavors are impeccable and are held up on a heavy yet delicate body. Bravo. 750 charactersVonerichs, Sep 27, 2013

Smells of roasted malt, I kinda pickup some black malt, not sure. Tastes very balanced with chocolate, coffee, and finishes with the black malt character mentioned before. All around good beer and if there isn't any black malt, my bad.

4.94/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First review. 
I've had Everett before, but this time I felt a full review was necessary. Bottle served in Black Star Co-op "estate" glasses, split with my better half. No idea the age of the bottle--I received it in a trade a couple of months ago and it's been sitting quietly in my basement. 
A: Expected very dark brown (nearly black) with a fantastic pillowy, tan head that has reasonable retention. 
S: This is the only place I felt Everett could earn perfection. Roast aroma was spot-on, but I wanted a skosh more malt character in the nose--mainly looking for chocolate/toffee. No question about the style, but after tasting, I guess I expected the nose to ride side by side with the rest of the beer. 
T: From front to back this beer is perfect. Light malts in the foreground transitioning into the roasted chocolate perfection I wish was in the nose (not to say the nose wasn't near perfect, but every time the glass approached my mouth, I wanted the anticipation of the next sip to start with the nose). Sometimes a fine line sits between porters and stouts that the styles become blurred, but for some reason I never once thought that this could be a stout. Everett toes the line perfectly. One more step forward and you're drinking a light stout. 7.5% is on the high end for the style and I ain't even mad because it's completely nonexistent. I could drink this for an entire evening. 
M: After the first sip I had to sit back in my seat. Up front Everett almost comes off too light, as if Shaun Hill forgot what he was doing, but as the beer moves across your palate you realize that not only did Shaun Hill know what he was doing, but he has set the bar for what this style should strive to become. The taste is nothing without the mouthfeel, and to make a porter this creamy and fluffy with a perfect, tiny zing of carbonation in the back takes a lot more than simply knowing how to brew a porter. 
O: As previously mentioned, Everett is what all robust porters should strive to be. If you are brewing this style on a small or large scale and need some guidance, either look to Everett for inspiration or just give up, because chances are you aren't going to be able to create a porter experience that's even in the same universe as this beer. 
Each time I have a Hill Farmstead beer I want to be disappointed. I want to be able to get off the hype train at the next stop and buy a ticket to a different destination but every time I end up staying in my seat, waiting for the next time I'm fortunate enough to have the opportunity to experience near perfection. 2,583 characterspawpaw, Sep 24, 2013

A: Black, really black. Not much head but retains well.
S: Roasty comes to mind. Smooth coffee smell.
T: A porter can't get better than this. Perfect roasted coffee and malty goodness. I would take this over most stouts any day.
M: Good mouthfeel. Some porters are too thin, Everett does not have that problem.
O: I wanted to make my first review Everett because it is my favorite "shelf" beer. I can't imagine a more perfect representation of the style. If only Shaun would can this ( I know, it'll never happen.) Seek this beer out whenever it is available. It's not as hyped as the Saisons and limited stuff, but its worth it. 703 charactersDonFrap, Aug 01, 2013

A: not pitch black, but a very dark brown. head is very frothy and a rich brown hue. retention is terrific. thick spots of lacing left behind. 
S: I think this has more rich sweet and dark chocolate than any roast. a very minor warming factor. rich, warm, inviting. 
T: a lot of roast, even more chocolate. a boatload more chocolate. perhaps a little bit of astringency. minor vanilla. soft sweetness. there may be a touch of espresso in here too. however the finish is all dark chocolate. 
M: the mouthfeel is different but fucking awesome. not quite nitro, but super soft and super smooth. 
D: nice to see an American porter on the prestigious top 250 list, especially this high. very tasty shit. certainly one of the best porters I have had, however this mouthfeel and flavor is making me think more stout-side than porter-side. regardless, go get some. 903 charactersJimmys, Jul 30, 2013

Poured into a glass goblet.
Black in color with a dark, tan head, 1.5 fingers in height. Bittersweet chocolate on the nose, hint of coffee, then sweeter milk chocolate. Super thick and smooth on the palate with loads of chocolate malt, it’s sweet up front with a bittersweet finish. There is substantial lacing on the glass. Coffee flavors are very present, even though no coffee was used. At 7.5%, the alcohol is well-hidden. I think I am drinking this too fast, - it’s that good. This beer has incredible body for a porter and has an almost oily quality…it could easily pass for a stout. The bitterness from the chocolate malts and Columbus hops really gives it its character. This is an intense porter, but everything comes together magically and produces one of the best porters I've had to date. 824 charactersgreenmtn1111, Jul 24, 2013

A: Pours a crude oil, black color with about a finger or 2 of khaki colored head. Not much lacing left along the glass as I drink away.
S: The smell of coffee and roasted malts overtake my nose. A slight whiff of smoke is also present. Some faints smells of dark fruits come through, though not as prominent as the coffee and roasted malts. Good stuff here.
T: Wow! What an experience this is! The flavors of coffee and roasted malts are incredible. Also there is a good smokiness at the end which is something that I've never tasted in any porter I've ever had. The dark fruits that I mentioned in the smell section come through in a mild way. The taste of this porter is like nothing I've ever tasted and it is definitely the best tasting porter I've ever had. This is truly awesome. There isn't an incredible amount of depth, but honestly it's not really needed with the flavors that this brew exudes.
M: A medium to heavy mouthfeel. This beer is so damn creamy and smooth. A very balanced beer and I've yet to taste any alcohol at all. A slightly dry finish that lingers, but not for too long. A pleasant feel.
Overall: This is by far the best porter I have ever had in my beer drinking life. I am truly unsure if I'll ever have one that can even contend with this. The smell of brewed coffee along with the smokiness that comes through when I drink this just make Everett an absolute treat to taste. I only bought 2 bottles at Hill Farmstead and right now I am kicking myself for not grabbing at least 2 more. What an amazing beer. Awesome job, Shaun Hill and co.!! 1,603 charactersRichD, Jul 13, 2013

A-A bold black body with a thin incremental brown head. Lacing is minimal.
S-Roasted malt is the main component of the aroma. Dark chocolate, very mild smokiness and dark fruits of raisin and plum are subtle.
T-Again the roasted malt is upfront with a more pronounced smoke note on the palate. Dense dark chocolate is more towards the finish and after taste. The roastiness lingers with the dark chocolate in the finish. Very good and smooth. As it warms the alcohol becomes apparent and the dark fruit becomes more assertive. The two mix well and leave a great finish.
M-Full bodied, carbonation is apparent on the tongue. Sweet finish.
O-A beautifully done Porter. Highly drinkable even on this warm summer night. Have had this on tap once before and it was great and having this in a bottle does not disappoint. Wish I had another one to age for 6 months to see the subtle changes that would develop. I have to keep my eye open for the barrel aged version. 995 charactersmikem0487, Jul 02, 2013

Appearance: Pours a dark brown and leaves a half finger or so of tan head.
Smell: Roasted malt, raisins, plums, figs, coffee, chocolate.
Taste: Matches the nose: roasted malts, dark fruits, cocoa, coffee, slight bitterness. Well balanced porter. The smooth finish really sets this one apart.
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium body, creamy. Very smooth and very well balanced.
Overall: This is an excellent porter - perhaps the best "standard" for the porter style that I have had. 653 charactersResuin, Jul 01, 2013

The beer pours a nice jet black color, touches of cola brown when struck by the light with a nice finger or two of khaki head that has decent retention and leaves a decent amount of spotted lacing. The aroma is simply amazing, loads of bitter dark chocolate, rich smooth dark malt, roasted coffee beans, lightly toasted grain, molasses with touches of chalkiness and a bit of stone fruit and alcohol on the finish. The flavors are really lovely and quite in line with the nose, lots of chocolate and coffee with super smooth grain that has some lightly toasted qualities, stone fruit, a touch of licorice and lightly abrasive alcohol as it goes down. The flavors are exceptionally complex and the balance is near perfect, each sip brings out something new and exciting. The body is fantastically rich, smooth and coats the mouth very well and has a wonderfully creamy finish that has a bit of dryness to it. 
Verdict: Spectacular to say the least. This porter is absurdly complex, impressively balanced and just a delight to drink. Easily the best Porter I've tried to date and one of the more impressive beers from Hill Farmstead. For a beer that doesn't rely on the crutch of barrel aging or adjuncts, this is quite the experience. 1,295 characterskevanb, Jun 30, 2013
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.2516.9 oz. bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Thanks to roon for chance to try this one.
Appearance: Deep dark brown with a nice 2" head that recedes to a healthy cap which leaves lots of sticky lacing.
Smell: Roasted malt which is coffee forward when cold but turns more chocolaty as it warms in the glass.
Taste: Similar to the nose, very coffee forward when colder with the roasty bitterness combining with some hoppy bitterness on the finish. Some warmth and the flavor unlocks, the coffee moves toward mocha then dark chocolate. Almost a lactic sweetness comes forward giving this beer a very nice finish. Pleasantly bitter on the finish, again, a combination of roasted malts and hops.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy.
Overall: Very nice porter, a flavor bomb, one of the best I've sampled. 795 charactersBobZ, Jun 30, 2013

4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This brew was poured from a growler into Hill Farmstead stemware, showing the color of burnt molasses. It put up a one and a half finger head of big coffee colored bubbles, showing nice retention. Creamy rings of lacing were left around the glass as it dissipated at a slower pace. No haze or sediment was appreciated, and carbonation appeared to be active. The nose was heavy, with cloying coffee and chocolate malt melt and residual dextrins, deep black and brown malt roastiness, floral hop freshness, ash, brown sugars, mineral, glassy metallics, and warming booze. Our first impression was that this was a serious porter, with fantastic sweetness met by leafiness, sourness, and dark roast of grain. As we sipped, the buds were flooded with notes of thick roast, caramel, bittered chocolate, and caramel roastiness, soy sauce salts, green grassy and herbal hops, mineral water, baker’s yeast, vanilla icing sweetness, plum skins, and milk chocolate oiliness. The middle came to a peak with more metallics, musk and funk of grain and straw, heavy dark chocolate bitterness, molasses sweetness, devil’s food cake breadiness, white sugar, gritty yeast, and phenolic medicinals. The ending wash came with even greater sweetness of toffee and caramel candies, bittered waxiness, lactic cream, mineral, metallic coffee bean bite, vanilla extract, stark booziness, buttery warmth, brown sugar toast, tobacco leafiness, and burnt floral hops. The aftertaste breathed of salty seawater, vegetals, blackboard chalkiness, baker’s yeast bite, coffee and richly toffee malts, cooked brown sugars, earthy and floral hop balance, wild roasty sweetness, tobacco smokiness, cakey breadiness, wheat rind, distant lemon zest, and brassy metallics. The body was full, and the carbonation was medium. Each sip gave wonderful sip, smack, slurp, cream, and froth. The finishing pop was crisp, and the corners of the mouth were left sticky and taken care of. The mouth was left thickly coated and equally as sticky, with eventual dry astringency across the hard palate. The abv was appropriate, and the beer sipped excellently.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma and its flavoring. The nose gives roasty malts and robustness off the bat, with the taste following suite wonderfully. The latter actually was much more rich than expected, with toffees and caramels giving more thickness, sweetness, and flavor across the taste. This was helped along by a silky smooth feel that left the mouth coated, but also asking for more. The sip was smooth, and everything was really inviting about this beer, making it second in the line of Hill Farmstead beers that we’ve been impressed with. Fantastic for the style, deep, and contemplative. 2,745 charactersTheBrewo, Jun 27, 2013

Color was a very very dark brown that was almost black and was completely opaque. Came out a bit on the thicker side. Aroma was slightly sweet, but a bit burnt as well. Almost like a burnt mocha with just a hint of malt. Flavor was very similar to the smell. Seemed like a roasted grain, with some sweetness from lactose. A small hint of bitter on the backend, but very balanced. Felt very good in the mouth. Coated extremely well, with a bit of tingle from carbonation. Overall a very smooth and well balanced beer Pleasant to drink, perhaps a bit to sweet to be sessionable. 672 charactersmountdew1, Jun 25, 2013

A - Poured black with a two finger beige head. Decent rings of lace and a half finger of retention. 
S - Super rich chocolate, tobacco, licorice, leather, shoe polish.
T - Tobacco, bitter coffee, leather, lot's of chocolate, a bit ashy. Strong milk chocolate moves to a bitter coffee flavour and becomes more rich and sweet later.
M - Good carbonation, full body, and a sweetness that moves to dry in the finish. 
O/D - A solid porter. Very complex and drinkable. Not the craziest thing out there, but it hits all the requisite points right one. Good stuff. 599 charactersbylerteck, Jun 10, 2013

A: Pours very black as expected, very quick, light chocolate tan head, dies off pretty quickly, little lakes of lacing floating on top.
S: Pretty light on the nose at the initial temp, but most of the aroma is the roasted malts...I don't get much hops or bitterness, but mainly chocolates...
T: Right out of the bottle (at above noted temps), starts light, lots of roasted malts....but in a milk chocolate way that is typical of porters, not that sweet at all and with that interesting earthy/acidic barley flavour, finishes slightly bitter burnt espresso coffee, caramel, and as others note, roasted almonds/nuts.
M: Light, nice carbonation (may differ from bottle, but still, as with all HF, naturally carbonated... extremely balanced and smooth, not really sticky like a stout or overly dry....allows for easy drinking
O: Certainly the best porter I've had... not too light, but has that easy drinking style compared to stouts, but quite full flavoured, too often porters turn out more watery as they try to get that nice drinkability but this one doesn't disappointed... not overly hoppy either, with just a lot of nice burnt/roasted malt profiles blending together... where the typical porter runs around 5% but turns out flat, HF has been able to finally build up the malt profile while raising the ABV, but without sacrificing the style and making it syrupy/sticky/stout like... love it... 1,532 characters4ster, Jun 01, 2013

4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to unbreakabolt for this in-person trade. Saved me a trip to Vermont, at the mere cost of 2 KBS. Picked up by him in late March, consumed on 5-26-2013.
Poured from a 500 mL (16.9 oz) bottle to a 13.75 oz tulip - 10 oz at first, with the remainder capped and placed back in the fridge. Poured the remainder after downing the first pour in approximately 40 minutes. In other words, the beer sat at room temperature warming for at most 40 minutes. Certainly not unreasonable, considering the recommendation to serve heavier stouts at 55 or so.
This beer demonstrates the fine stylistic line between "porter" and "stout," right from the pour. There is an unexpected "glug glug" aspect. Pleasant and inviting.
Close to black appearance, with slight (1/2 finger) darker tan head - though this was not a vigorous pour. Darker "English and German roasted malts" making their presence felt. The head did not linger long, with minimal lacing.
Aroma: Roasted malt, plain and simple, true to the description on the bottle ("American malted barley, English and German roasted malts [pale, caramel, and chocolate]"). French roast coffee grinds, chocolate, with a hint of milk lactose and oat. I sense the American hops [Columbus] more early on - very faint fruit (grape skin, but not citrus). Again, this is close to a milk stout or (lower ABV) RIS initially. Certainly not as hoppy as Storm King, but comparable aroma to GL Blackout.
Early sips, I thought there was a hop bite to the aftertaste, a la Storm King. With time, however, I realized the bite owed to the bold roasted grains. Coffee and chocolate primarily, with a very pleasant sweetness that was not cloying in any way. It is not, coffeewise, on the level of FBS. Not noticeably carbonated. Mouthfeel and taste not drawn out. Palate not left "coated." Very smooth to the last drop. Overall impression next day: pleasant roasted grain, slight chocolate.
Coming to this tasting, I did not hold "robust" porters (Founders, Smuttynose) in high esteem, especially in comparison to Eddy Fitz and Anchor. True, those are lower ABV, but I preferred the less bitter approach taken by them. With time, however, I came to appreciate the boldness of this beer. It is very smooth, an indication of the attention to detail paid by HF. It is complex, not sure I would call it "decadent" in its depth though. All told, I'm not sure if this is my fave porter, but it is damn close. More impressive than Eddy FItz out of the bottle (I'd hope so, at $8 a pop). 2,503 charactersStoutItOutLoud, May 27, 2013

Appearance – On the lighter side of black. Creamy brown head. Slight lacing.
Smell – Chocolate and roasted barley. Some vanilla.
Taste – Very bold, burnt/roasted backbone. Chocolate is prominent. Slight boozy taste.
Holy shit, man! Perhaps it’s the anticipation of having 64 ounces of this godly liquid in my fridge for a few days untouched… or perhaps it’s because the first glass I had was after drinking four crappy Lionsheads… or maybe it’s because it is ABSOLUTELY delicious, but this beer woke me up from the tired stupor I was in on this boring Saturday night. I had barely gotten done taking the picture of it in the glass before it was going down the hatch. It is known that I love imperial porters but this takes that love to a different place. A honeymoon in Hawaii perhaps… OK I’ll leave the weird, romantic shit at the door…
In all seriousness, Earl’s bigger and more badass brother Everett has a huge roasted barley taste which is the highlight of this beer, it REALLY catches your attention, and if you like that sort of flavor you will be blown away. The chocolate along with the smooth mouthfeel assist in the drinkability which is unusually high considering the strong flavor.
One more time, thanks to Brian for making this consumption possible! Cheers! 1,342 charactersRummyRedbeard, May 24, 2013

Somewhere in the Porter or Stout register, the beer pours with a creamy and lavish separation of darkest "bark" brown ale and light mocha-tan meringue that forms on top. Firm withstanding and intricate lacing patterns emerge as the foam character easily endures the session. To the eye, the beer is as good as advertised.
Strong roasty-sweet aromas are easily confused with Stout, but the scent shares elements of heavy toast, walnuts, bold-roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and an almost milkshake-like malty-sweet undercurrent.
And that milkshake like taste is alive on the early palate as the taste of burnt caramel, heavy whipping cream, vanilla and near-yougurt milky tang all make a mark early. Simultaneous taste of strong fresh coffee, roasted nuts, bitter chocolate, and heavily charred toast balance the sweetness and creaminess and offer an identity of their own. Nearly strong enough to suggest Stout, the beer restrains its deep roasty dryness to win over the Porter argument. A finish of coffee-like bitterness and roasted nuts close the beer malty-dry and decadent in taste.
Full bodied, creamy and velvety- the Porter rivals any Milk or Oatmeal Stout on the market. The beer simply blankets the mouth with a cocoon of creaminess that latches onto the mouth and seduces it with its silk. The beer retains its creamy structure until very late in the session where rummy alcohol warmth, light bitterness, and drying roast malt sharpens the textures to signal a long and roasty aftertaste.
I'm not sure if the ale is more of a Porter or a Stout, but style-police aside, this is a sultry and savory beer of roasted proportions that soothes the sense of taste like few can. Its remarkable drinkability would allow for a greater rate of consumption if its savory creaminess didn't act so dessert-like on the mouth. 1,990 charactersBEERchitect, May 16, 2013

Appearance: Standard porter. Deep black, small dark tan head.
Nose: Fragrant fresh coffee beans, rich milky chocolate, and a subtle hint of green apple in the background. 
Taste: Very clean and rich. Initial taste is freshly brewed dark coffee, there's some lightly tart green apple in the middle, and it finishes with an incredibly rich chocolate covered espresso bean flavor. 
Mouthfeel: Perfectly creamy and carbonated. Very drinkable, as a porter should be.
Overall: Easily my favorite porter to date. It's a fairly straightforward style that's taken to a new level of richness and sophistication by Hill Farmstead. 665 charactersfdig23, May 11, 2013

T - Incredibly full, robust blend of dark, roasted malt, again, just a tinge of sweetness, before finishing with bitter, full, roasted coffee. That's an incredible taste. It goes from phase to phase seemlessly. Perfection.
M - Exactly what you want in a porter. Perfect mouthfeel here. It's creamy, a little thinner than a stout, and smooth.
Overall - This is it. World's best porter, and I love porters. Hill Farmstead has it. Absolutely excellent beer. 785 charactersBeerBuckeye, May 10, 2013

On tap at The Prohibition Pig. Pours a pitch black color with an inch of light brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is of roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee. Maybe some hints of smoke. This beer has a nice roasted malts flavor with some bitter dark chocolate and coffee. Earthy with hints of smoke. Not much of an alcohol presence. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, damn good Porter worth seeking out. 481 charactersPicoPapa, May 08, 2013

Pours with a stout-like darkness and a nice healthy looking mocha head. Strong lacing, looks well carbonated.
Smell is roasty malt and chocolate and a bit of a hop presence (strikes me as centennial but i'm probably wrong). The hop presence is far from overwhelming, but stronger than in most porters.
Taste is in line with smell, but just a little more enjoyable. Lots of roasty chocolate goodness without being overwhelming. No real sense of alcohol and no real bitterness in the finish. Just as with the smell, the hops are evident but not jarring.
Mouthfeel is fine for the style. Feels pretty smooth and is easy to drink.
Overall this is probably the best porter i've ever had. Based on its ranking, i don't feel particularly creative in making that assertion. It's super drinkable while having its hop and malt character remain assertive while simultaneously blending together well. Kind of a slightly better, lighter version of fresh Nightstalker. Give it a try if you can, but then again you already knew that.

Nearly jet black, ring of tan head, some lace as well on the glass. Smell is a wonderful mix of roast and chocolate, coffee notes mix with hops give off a nice bittersweet presence, a little bit of liquorice, but such a rich roast that is truly lovely is right upfront the whole time. Taste Is a mix of rich dark chocolate and roasted malts, coffee and a bit of milk chocolate with a touch of anise/liquorice, moderately bitter hop bill here as well, lovely roasted finish and chocolatey aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, full bodied, good feel throughout. This is no doubt the best porter to have met my glass, an absolutely drinkable beer that I would drink as often as I am lucky to encounter it. 744 characterspeensteen, Apr 08, 2013

Aroma of coffee, chocolate, caramel, alcohol and slight slight spice. Sweet creamy chocolate taste with coffee notes and slight spice pinch. Perhaps a slight vanilla to add silkiness. Love it. Best porter I have had. It gets as close to a stout as a porter will get without crossing the line. 392 characterschalsk, Apr 07, 2013

A~ black! with hardly any head.

T~ Cocoa, roasty malts, and dark figs up front. followed by a crazy sweetness on the finish with a dark coffee aftertaste. wow! way more coffee on the nose though.
M~ oh so smooth! slightly carbonated, has more of a stout feel then a porter.

Pours a rich dark chocolaty brown. Huge head, doesn't go down until halfway through the glass.
The smell and taste is all about the roast. Really high quality malts used here. Lots of chocolate, bit of coffee bitterness, lots of roasty bitterness. Never gets to be fatiguing, though. Tastes like a stout by most breweries' standards.
Full, thick creamy mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.
Awesome. I'm glad I got to snag a bottle of this at Hill Farmstead and look forward to the day I can drink it again. 569 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 31, 2013

Black in color. Tan head with lace.
Flavors of coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. Rich and creamy. A little bit of hops show. Reminds me of 11 darkness. 
Mouthfeel: smooth and creamy. Full bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Ends a little dry and roasted.
Overall, one of the best porters I have had. Everything you could ask for in a porter. 427 charactersmothman, Mar 26, 2013

Black with a tan/brown head. Great retention and good lacing. Nose has an amazing roast character, milk chocolate and even a hint of licorice. Taste has again a phenomenal roasted malt character, some toasty notes, milk and darker chocolate and the hops are still prominent in the background. Mild acidity. Medium feel, and carbonation could be taken down a half notch. I would worship this on cask. 489 charactersliamt07, Mar 17, 2013

A - Black like a stout. Pours and settles not too different than a beer like Old Rasputin. I'm not a huge porter guy, but if I have one I want it to look like this. Darker khaki head with decent lacing. 
S - Cocoa, roast, dark fruits and a touch of vanilla. 
T - Follows the nose, as I notice that most Hill Farmstead beers do. Chocolate and dark cocoa mixed with a great roasted malt character. Finish has that touch of vanilla. 
M - Bright carbonation, not over or under. Not sure how bottles are carbed, but this is great out of the keg and into the growler 4 days ago. 
O - Excellent porter. Drinks like a darker, more dark-cocoa forward Founders porter. 714 charactersDevilsCups, Feb 28, 2013

Pours a deep dark brown that appears black in the glass except for at the very edges if held up to the light. A huge khaki head of tight foam, that almost looks like it should be from a nitro tap despite it being from a bottle pour, recedes slowly and leaves tons of lacing.
The aroma is primarily of deep dark roasted malts. Big notes of bitter dark chocolate and luscious dark roast coffee. So impressive considering there are no adjuncts in this! Just perfectly balanced malt notes!
The flavor is more of the same. Just beautifully balanced roasted malts, bitter chocolate notes, and nice, lightly acidic coffee flavors. Some nice vinous notes on the back end as well.
The body is medium to thick, with a silky smooth mouth feel. Good carbonation, and a nice dry, bitter finish.
This is hands down the best straight up porter in the world! No adjuncts? No problem! Just a beautifully balanced, delicious, no-frills porter! 1,036 charactersSadMachine, Feb 25, 2013

This beer is somewhat disappointing though...rich and sweet as you would expect, maybe some chocolate and vanilla, but it's too malty for me to really love. Needs either some more roast, some more hop character, or some more pronounced chocolate. Mouthfeel is thick and really nice, and overall this is a good and solid porter, but it was the weakest HF beer out of a lineup of ten and I really didn't think this was anything exceptional.

Pours a cola brown color with minimal tan head moving quickly to a thin surface layer that sticks around throughout sampling.
Aroma is all malt with roasted notes and coffee grinds mixing throughout tasting, I also get some dark molasses notes and a bit of grassy hop that is buried deep in the nose.
First sip reveals an average to thick body with a silky smooth texture and gentle carbonation.
Flavor is all malt with roasted notes and a bit of dark cocoa chocolate. I also get brown sugar on the finish. No hint of booze or hops on the flavor profile.
Quite a nice drinkable beer. Worth the travel to get a bottle. Thanks to Stopper for sharing! 691 characterssulldaddy, Feb 04, 2013

500ml bottle poured int GI pint
Pour: I would not call this black but probably as close to black as it can get. It is a very dark brown with an outstanding 3 finger light brown head. Head receded slowly leaving a ton of lacing that is sticking to the entire area where the head once was. 
Smell: A wonderful balance of chocolate and roast at first. Neither one is dominant and they complement each other to perfection. Digging a little deeper I get some vanilla, caramel, some dark fruits, a bit of coffee and a touch of earthy hops. Smells like a semi-sweet chocolate cake.
Taste: Chocolate decadence in a beer! Chocolate syrup, chocolate cake, chocolate fudge brownies all come to mind first. There is a mild roast but like the nose is in perfect harmony with the chocolate without one over powering the other. Some coffee, vanilla, and maybe reaching for a dark fruit (raisin) note. The finish is a bit bitter.
Mouthfeel: This is how a porter should feel IMO. Medium bodied to slightly full especially for a porter with an indescribable perfect amount of carbonation making for an absolute wonderful feeling beer. Creamy and fulfilling in the mouth covering the palate to perfection urging yet another sip.
Overall: I love stouts and especially ones that have spent time in a barrel but let me say that I would take this beer any day. One of the best beers I have had to date and cannot say enough good things about how well done this beer is. 1,499 characterssleuthdog, Feb 04, 2013

Poured into an imperial pint glass, this is a porter with a ton of life; I can't fit head & body into the glass. Let us have a moment of stillness. The smell is what a great porter should smell like: big chocolate & roast, underbite of lactose, gracefully blended. Nice. 
Everett, I would like to pen you a love letter, because you are beautiful. Seriously. It's not that there's chocolate & roast - it's that they're Perfectly Balanced & serenading the tongue. I can't tell which one is first, last, or always. Bittersweetness loads up the middle, whether hopping or part of the chocolate, I'm unsure (& don't care), along with a bit of lactose. Then everything recombines like a fine piece of furniture for the flawless finish. I could drink this by the bathtub full. 
If every porter tasted like this there would be a worldwide shortage of porters. Without putting it in a barrel or aging it on bamboo shoots or having ferrets poop in it - well, it's just borderline perfect. Certainly the best straight-up porter I've ever had, & a fantastic beer. 1,271 charactersmaximum12, Jan 11, 2013

A: Pours a very deep, dark brown. Close to black, but not quite there. A moderately aggressive pour yields about 3-4 fingers of creamy brown head. Retention is spectacular, and large sheets of clumpy lacing blanket the glass. 
S: Fudge, french roast, German chocolate cake, some nutty and earthy yeast. Black cocoa powder and whiffs of charcoal-like roasted malt. Hints of vanilla and caramel. Very mild alcohol ester and some darkfruits in the background. Fig and plum. 
T: Chocolate syrup, double chocolate cake, roasted coffee beans, a bit of a woody impression. Caramel and a slight creamy vanilla impression in the background. More chocolate cake. Very subtle fruity tastes of fig and date. Long, lingering finish of semi sweet dark chocolate, fudge, and roasted coffee beans. 
M: Medium bodied. Extraordinarily creamy and velvety smooth. Low carbonation. You rarely come across a mouthfeel like this.
O: This is truly one of the top porters I've ever had. Its shining points are a layered, nuanced, and shifting malt complexity and an uncommonly creamy and smooth body. Its weaknesses are none. 1,151 charactersryan1788a5, Jan 02, 2013

Pours a deep dark brown color with a very nice tan colored head.
Aromas are nutty, with notes of heavily roasted malts, some light dark fruits, cocoa and mineral hops. Nose is nice, but subtle.
Upon first sip I can see why this is highly regarded. Light cocoa, dark bread, coffee and slightly sweet cream flavors up front. Finish is crisp, with a nice earthy hop bite. Nice flavors, and great balance.
Mouthfeel is good, smooth, soft, and full, with nice carbonation.
Overall, a top notch porter, one of the best I've had in a while. The first Hill Farmstead beer I had was good (Holger Danske), this one is very good. 665 charactersflexabull, Jan 02, 2013

Taste is a very robust porter with quite strong roasted malt notes with a side sot of espresso and light subtle green hops. Body is super full with strong carbonation, no apparent alcohol and a nice creamy texture. Probably one of the best porter I ever had a chance to drink. 474 charactersPhyl21ca, Dec 24, 2012

A: Requisite deep brown, nearly opaque black color. Creamy and deep - surprisingly deep - tan head with dense lacing that breaks like that of the most viscous stouts. Remarkable.
S: Roasted and chocolate malt, dark chocolate, hazelnut. Considerable smoke from some unknown but heavenly source. Some lactose-like sweetness at the end.
T: Everything in the nose, plus: begins to taste like a smokehouse smells (lightly) as it warms, tobacco in the middle, light earthy hop bitterness in the aftertaste.
M: The pour suggested that it may have been a bit too carbonated; fortunately that was not true - it's velvety and smooth.
Overall: The benchmark American porter. 713 characterskcbaby, Dec 23, 2012

Big roasted notes, medium roasted coffee, dark roasted malt, a light smokiness, dark chocolate. A hint of citrusy hop bitterness and dark fruit as it warms a little. 
Taking a sip, bitterness upfront, roasted malt and coffee with some earthiness, then mellows to fruitier coffee flavors, bittersweet chocolate, sweet almond, graham cracker. Lingering coffee and roasted malt flavors on the tongue after a swallow. 
Probably on the lighter side of medium, but the good carbonation helps contribute to a slightly creamy mouthfeel. A very nicely crafted porter. 766 charactersnataku00, Dec 15, 2012

Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
Thanks to Futura123 for this bottle. 
Appearance: Wow, Everett is one dark porter! It appears pitch black in the glass, with a back light only showing a some faint red-brown streaks along the edges of the glass. A rough pour yields a massive creamy tan coloured head, that lasts really well and leaves some thick lacing. 
Smell: Mmmm, this smells delicious and a lot roastier than I expected from a standard porter. The initial nose offers dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, dark toasted grains, some char, a hint of smoke and some cocoa. As the beer begins to warm, more toasted notes become apparent, alongside earthy tobacco, brown sugar, milk chocolate, molasses and the faintest hint of vanilla. 
Taste: As with the nose, the flavour initially leans towards the roasted side of things, with an underlying sweetness becoming apparent with warming. Notes include: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, some coffee, a touch of smoke, some ash/char, dark toasted grains, a little milk chocolate, a touch of earthy tobacco and an underlying sweetness that is reminiscent of dark fruits and molasses. The finish is fairly bitter and lightly astringent. There is no trace of the 7,5%. 
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is just about perfect for a standard porter and makes for a fantastically drinkable beer. Medium (or just over) bodied, with a medium level of wonderfully creamy carbonation. 
Overall: Everett is an outstanding porter and certainly deserves its place on the top 100 list. I would kill to have this available locally - a few pints would go down wonderfully well over the course of a football game. 1,683 charactersThehuntmaster, Dec 13, 2012

Into my Central Waters snifter: pours black with a nice mocha colored head with some substantial staying power. My wife actually said, "that looks nice. Can I have a glass?" She's right, this looks scrumptious.
Loads of chocolate on the nose along with a dry bitter roast. Coffee with cream, light yeast, and a touch of herbal hops as well. 
Velvety dark chocolate in spades and big dry bitter roast from the nose loom large. Some bright orange notes from the Columbus hops punch through the middle, coupled with the medium roast coffee. Long and lingering light bitterness on the finish that I can only describe as barky...not the dog type, but the woodsy tree type. Not sure it makes sense, but I pulled a ton of that from Daybreak and I find it here as well. Soft vanilla on the back end.
Creamy and luscious and simply soft and luxurious. The first small pour seemed over carbonated, but the bottle seems to have settled down. Alcohol is non existent throughout. 
If other porters even considered moving into the neighborhood, I'd be a hell of a lot more interested in the style. Then again, Everett would kick those lesser porters' asses and make them feel a fool. 1,248 charactersBarrytheBear, Nov 19, 2012

Appearance: Talk about a sexy head… words don't do it justice. The lacing is comparable in its thick and lush layers. Inky thick black into the glass.
Smell: Coffee, roasted malts, tobacco. Very nice.
Taste: A luscious blend of coffee, malt, hops. Not bitter in the least. This guy is a little bit on the sweet side, but otherwise nails it.
Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy, but perfect for the style. Perfectly carbed.
Drinkability: Pretty high. It's sweetness might get to me after one bottle, but the one bottle is awesome.
Overall: This is a fantastic beer. This is a porter but almost seems to push into coffee stout territory, and this one pretty much nails it. 729 characterscbeer88, Nov 15, 2012

Pours a dark brown to black color with a caramel colored head. About three centimeters of head forms and lingers for a bit before receding to a healthy, bubbly ring and patches across the surface of the liquid. Scattered patches of sticky lacing decorate the glass. 
The aroma is of chocolate, brown sugar, roasted barley, a bit of toffee or caramel, and a hint of dark licorice. 
The taste is of bitter chocolate, licorice, caramel, brown sugar, roasted barley, some muddle, earthy grains, and a vague hint of citrus. It’s fairly sweet when you break it down, but it’s exceptionally balanced by the roasted characteristics. 
The mouthfeel is spot on. Slightly bitter from the cacao and hops, full-bodied, and rich, but finishing quite cleanly and going down smoothly. The bitterness/roastiness subsides towards the back of the mouth, taking on a more velvet-like feel. 
Overall, this is a phenomenal porter. I pulled some strange individual flavors out of it, but they worked together beautifully. Well balanced, easy to drink, and simply delicious; a pleasure all around. 1,170 characterseclipse54, Nov 14, 2012

Very roasty aroma with a little bit of chocolate. A little bit of a burnt character to the roast.
Lots of roast in the flavor as well. Burnt malts with some dark coffee flavors bringing some chocolate along for the ride.
Medium bodied porter with medium carbonation levels. As normal, creamy mouthfeel gets the most out of the individual flavors. Very much on the dry side.
Very enjoyable although perhaps a bit disappointed from the hype. A very well made enjoyable porter I'll seek out again, although nothing that screams "best porter ever". 612 charactersjmarsh123, Nov 13, 2012

Maybe some chicory too. Overall the aroma is clean for a porter, no real hop or yeast quality. Dark chocolate, cacao, chalky. Coffee is certainly big. I look for but can not find vanilla. There is a dry bitterness associated with roast. The body is full without being sweet. 494 characterspmlondrigan, Nov 06, 2012

Pours straight black with half of finger of khaki head that recedes to some splotchy lacing in the glass.
The aroma is powerful and complex lots of chocolate up front with some roasted coffee in the background. Very "clean" aroma, everything fits together and nothing clashes.
The taste is more of the same. In the wine world I would say this beer has good concentration. It is full of flavor but does not taste harsh or cloying. Just enough bitterness to cleanse my palate and keep me wanting more.
The mouthfeel is phenomenal, smooth, just a touch creamy, very drinkable, glad to take down the whole 500ml by myself.
Overall I tried to keep my expectations in check and started with a very critical eye but this beer delivers, this is definitely becoming a perma-want. 810 charactersquirkzoo, Oct 30, 2012

Appearance – Pours into my Darkness tulip with an opaque black color. Held up to the light there is just the faintest light coming through around the edges causing the beer to look dark brown. About a finger of mocha colored head that dissipates slowly leaving decent lacing.
Smell – Heavy roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa, slight coffee, vanilla, and just a hint of anise licorice. 
Taste – I will be the first to admit I love a good porter. I will also be the first to state that I have never really gotten into the “hype” with HF. I by no means am saying their beers are bad (I have been able to sample MANY of their beers thanks to numerous generous Chi-town BA’s), just that when I drink them, I rate them as if they didn’t have the hype surrounding them. That said, damn this is a good porter. Begins with bittersweet cocoa mixed with a milky chocolate. A bit more coffee in the flavor than the aroma let on, which is followed by a prominent amount of roasted malts (which I enjoy more than less in my porters). At the tail end you can taste the licorice and a hint of sweet molasses, though it does finish a bit bitter (also what I look for in a good porter).
Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, moderate to lower carbonation, very rich and creamy in texture. Finishes nice and dry.
Overall – I am happy this is one of the “easier” to get beers from HF. I will be seeking this out in the future again for sure. An extremely well put together American Porter. 1,591 charactersSpdKilz, Oct 27, 2012

A - Pour is an dark coffee-brown, with a fluffy mocha-colored head that doesn't want to quit. Superior retention and awesome lacing that leaves spiderwebs all the way down the glass. 
S - Cocoa, molasses, a bit of tobacco, and roast. Some hint of alcohol lurking in the background.
T - Milk chocolate and a bit of coffee upfront. Plenty of roast, some light hoppiness, and vanilla in the finish. Absolutely fantastic.
M - Full bodied, with light carbonation. Slightly drying in the finish. Could maybe benefit from the prickliness that comes from somewhat more aggressive bubbles. 
O - There's some minor room for improvement, but this is still pretty easily the best straight-up porter that I've had to date. Shaun Hill is a damned wizard. 773 charactersdjmichaelk, Oct 23, 2012

A: pours black with a finger of mocha head that slowly recedes to about a 1/4 film that sticks around for the rest I the glass, beautiful lacing, great lookin beer.
S: milk chocolate with a light roastyness, some caramel sweetness, and a light hint of hops. There is also a light touch of smoke.
T: milk chocolate with a touch of roast and smoke, givin the brew some nice coffee like notes, there is a bit of sweetness in the middle, with notes of caramel and toffee, and then the hops come in lightly on tennis palate to the finish adding a light citrusy note, tasty and well balanced.
M: I love the mouthfeel here, it really makes the brew or me, thick, decadent and creamy, drinks with a beautiful velvetyness crisp carbonation on the high end of medium keeps the mouthfeel going, and a nice you h of dryness on the finish from the hops , leavs the mouth coated in deliciousness.
O: a good porter, I personally would have enjoyed a bit more roast and a bit less sweetness, but that is splitting hair w/ a brew this tasty, another great one From hill farmstead, I would recommend grabbing any offering you could find from these guys. 1,186 charactersPeterIngemi, Oct 17, 2012

T: the chocolate character was just as apparent on the palate alongside toffee caramel sweetness, hints of nuttiness, oat grains coming through with vanilla accents and a touch of molasses.

A- A light brown, mocha head sits atop an entirely pitch black brew. No light gets through at all. Good head retention, and lacing trails down the glass as I drink.
S- Burnt crispy malt. Dark and bitter roast coffee.
T- A fairly dry, roasty porter. Definitely taste the coffee, with notes of cocoa as well. Fairly bitter, unsweetened. To me this seems a bit watered down. Definitely takes away from the beer.
M- Smooth medium bodied porter with medium carbonation. Quite drinkable.
O- The keep it simple approach does work for the beer, and it is good. But I don't see this porter as mind blowing as the ratings are. It tasted pretty bland to me. I would have this again and my tastebuds could've been wrecked by this point in the day anyway. 808 charactershaazer, Oct 10, 2012

Pours a nice black with a sheet of mocha foam. Smells robust son! Chocolate, coffee, roasted barley, coffee (faint), cocoa powder, graham and more toasted malts. Flavor follows suit with a good earthy roasted character, a strong cocoa flavor, nice bits of coffee nib, and a sweetness I'm surprised at that is transient in nature and does not linger. Great flavor. Full bodied with tight and sharp carb loosely scattered, this leaves your mouth coated and satisfied, yet wanton for the next sip. This is a world class beer, and I think the best porter I've ever had. Sincerely wish I had a clone recipe. 616 charactersharrymel, Oct 04, 2012

The pour is midnight with a utterly insane deep mocha head erupting and sitting still for about 30 minutes. No joke. Infinite retention and giant lace of Jesus. Nose is wet tobacco, chili pepper, hazelnut liquor similar to De Molen Heaven & Hell. Taste has some salty chocolate bacon, savory umami, deep and rich baker chocolate and spicy chili pepper. Buttery, full, De Molen imperial stout palate. Wickedly rich. Unfair to put this in the porter category. Definitely the new superlative for style. 576 characterstarheels86, Oct 02, 2012

A: Pours a solid black color with a brown head forming on the pour. It recedes to a thin cap and collar that leaves some nice sticky, soapy lace down the glass.
S: Roasted malts and coffee beans up front. Some light bakers chocolate and some toffee.
T: The taste is transcendent. Milk chocolate, nice roasted malts and some chocolate covered espresso beans all fill my mouth and run across my taste buds. Delicious vanilla sweetness with a light toffee richness to it. The finish is a little bitter bakers chocolate, a hint of burnt sugar and some light molasses as well.
M: Creamy mouthfeel with a medium body. Medium low carbonation with a nice combination of roast and sweet notes on the finish with just a hint of dryness. The drinkability is off the charts.
O: This is an incredibly decadent treat. Rich and creamy with great notes of roast, chocolate and espresso. This is the best porter money can buy. I will be seeking this out again, and very soon. 1,068 charactersTreebs, Oct 02, 2012

Not much head on there or any lacing either. The smell of the beer is a mixture or roasted and smoked malts. The taste of the beer gives off a decent flavor of smoked malt that isn't salty which is a good thing. There isn't much in the way or chocolate or other roasted flavors in this one. The mouthfeel was on the thinner side, kinda low in carbonation. Overall this beer is decent in my opinion, I'm not really a fan of smoked flavors but I think for people who are this beer is awesome for them.

Pour: Incredibly murky dark, dark brown (not quite black) with a finger of light khaki head. Head recedes to a rim and leaves minimal lacing.
Smell: Roasted coffee beans, some dark chocolate, and a slight smoke. This porter certainly smells robust.
Taste: Bitter chocolate up front, bolstered with a heavy roastiness. Follows with nice bitter coffee grounds. This beer doesn't get too complex in my opinion, but everything it does it does nearly flawlessly.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, yet incredibly fluffy (if you can describe a porter in than way). A nice sipper, that goes down easy.

Appearance is absolute perfection. 1.5 finger dark mocha head with great retention. Oily legs and thick patchy lace that really sticks around. Beer is pitch black with a nice density. 
Very aromatic. Notes of coffee beans, chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, liquorice, and vanilla. A very subtle hop presence floats in the background too. Super appetizing.
Opens chocolate, cocoa, and light iced coffee. Some roasted malt peaks towards the middle but not enough to overpower the sweetness, only serving to balance it out. Very small notes of dark fruit at the end with more cocoa powder and chocolate. Molasses sweetness right at the end with a fudgy and roasted malt aftertaste. Doesn't get better than this. 
Medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Smooth and rich in the mouth and goes down smooth and slick. Spot on. Finish is slightly messy and filmy with a lingering aftertaste. Leaves me craving more. 
I've never given out all 5's but this is as close as it gets to perfection for me. For a brewery known for its pale ales and saisons to put out a porter of this caliber... Shaun Hill is a master and Hill Farmstead may just be the best all-around brewery on the planet. 1,255 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 26, 2012

A finger of mocha head sits atop and slowly fades leaving a patchy wall of lace sticking to the glass. A swirl effortlessly revives the cap.
The aroma includes roast with some bright citrus notes caught between hopiness and the citrus that is present sometimes in fresh coffee beans. Some hints of bitter chocolate to nutty aspect across the back that mixes with a bit of mineral quality.
The taste is bitter cocoa coupled with some nutty grain element. Chocolate and coffee is present with roast and quite a bit of minerals that mixes with some hints of citrus hopd. Across the back it gets somewhat fruity to floral with hops. The aftertaste is somewhat musty.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a nice arrangement of flavor but the hops clash a bit with the roast in almost an american black ale sort of way. Also, the mineral component here was fairly aggressive throughout, id rather that not be such a significant presence in the beer if i was to have it again. 1,118 charactersstakem, Sep 21, 2012

S - Robust indeed. Deep roasty malts, fresh espresso beans, sweet and lactic milk chocolate, and a touch of bitter mineral rich water. Finishes with sweet and rich vanilla. Perfect aroma.
T - Follows the nose with a pleasant mix of intense espresso beans, milk chocolate, vanilla and perfectly roasted malts. Just a touch of hop bitterness to work against the sweetness and richness of it all. Booze isn't present in the taste but there is a light warmth happening in the throat. 
M - Slick and coating mouth feel. Very silky with a high level of carbonation that prevents it from being cloying. 
O - The best porter I'v ever had, easily. Which sucks considering how tough it is to get bottles of this beer. Hype and availability aside, Hill Farmstead is the real deal. Unbelievable beer. 1,135 charactersdavey101, Sep 05, 2012

4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked up a 750mL growler of Hill Farmstead's big Porter, Everett, from the brewery during an early August beer pilgrimage. Served from the growler into a pint glass. Review is from notes. 
Appearance (4.5/5): Everett pours a nearly-black with brown highlights and is topped by a nice milk chocolate brown head of foam. This is a black beauty if there ever was one. Good things to come, I'm sure. 
Smell (5/5): Everett's aroma is quite pungent and VERY nice: notes of fresh brewed coffee, dark chocolate, roasted nuts spring to the fore. Roasty–one for the cooler months, for sure. Mellow, not very aggressive, and despite being a quite robust 7.5% ABV Porter, not a hint of booze in the nose. Top marks! The nose on this American Porter blows the doors even off of the venerable Founders Porter. 
Taste (4.5/5): The first thing one notices when drinking Everett is the roastiness, its dominant character. It stays in the driver's seat for the whole ride and lingers on into the long finish. Flavors of dark chocolate and fresh brewed coffee are there beautifully balancing against the roast fest and provide some sweetness and bitterness, respectively. There is some subtle, herbal hoppiness to the beer, too. Not a sweet beer, and it's also a little dry. The overall effect is wonderful: Everett ends up tasting like a flourless chocolate cake with a side of toasted almonds or walnuts. Excellent. 
Mouthfeel (4.5/5): Everett is smooth as silk, not very viscous, full-bodied and semi-dry. Its medium-light carbonation does not leave one wanting–you don't want a roasty dark beer like this to be bubbly! No, Everett is a silky palate massage if there ever was one. It has a looong finish that is a bit bitter and dry. Again, premium stuff. 
Overall (4.5/5): With all the insanely good hoppy stuff that Hill Farmstead puts out it can be easy to overlook their "house porter," Everett. Don't! Here is an American Porter with serious body, incredibly well balanced, deep flavors, a long finish, and a smooth finish (for when you get tired Abner's big, tropical fruit bitterness, maybe). Enjoy it with friends. 2,116 charactershagbergl, Aug 28, 2012

Syrupy black, with a thin yet dense head the color of cardboard. The bubbles stick to the walls and remain as a thick, frothy layer.
Woo. GREAT aroma. A smooth, robust blend of oats, chocolate malt, a touch of coffee, sweet wort boiling on the stove.
Equally solid flavor. Bigger bitterness, dark chocolate, a touch of espresso, some oak. The swallow brings everything together, with big chocolate bitterness and charred toast. Amazing balance.
Creamy medium body, thick in the mouth. Very soft, gentle carbonation and a touch of fizz. Not a hint of alcohol.
Great balance, flavor, and body. Very well-balanced, robust and delicious. 681 charactersPhelps, Aug 27, 2012

4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5500ml bottle into Duvel tulip. 
Appearance: Free pour yields a 1 inch darkish tan head that dissipates slowly leaving a tight ring of lacing. Pours solid black and looks full bodied. Leaves some lacing islands.
Smell: Coffee and cocoa, roasted malt, pastry sweetness, hint of piny hops that might be placebo. Booze infused pastry aromas, though all told not much alcohol in the nose. Develops with time, and smells great.
Taste: Follows the nose. Rich and delicious, with some prickly hop flavor at the end and moderate bitterness. Long chocolate cake aftertaste. Gets into coffee liqueur territory with the malt complexity. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, dark roast coffee, some nice burnt, husky/nutty roasted malt near the end. Aftertaste takes on some anise flavor with the chocolate cake after awhile.
So much going on, and it all works. This would be getting a 4.5 for flavor if the beer was an 11%ABV Russian Imperial Stout.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied. Silky smooth. Low side of moderate carbonation. Semi-dry finish. Perfection.
Overall: Everything about this beer is outstanding. It's ostentatiously good, like the brewer is trying to embarrass everyone else-- "See, this is how much flavor you can get out of these ingredients. Try harder everyone!" 1,262 charactersPahn, Aug 22, 2012

Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1/4" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades ever-so sedately, with leggy, slow-falling lace. Aroma is the definition of robust. Hearty dark malts and sweet chocolate. 
Taste starts with thick chocolate, creamy chocolate milk in the middle, balances out with some bitterness and coasts through the close. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth, and drinkability is superb. 
I told myself I wouldn't be misled by the label or the brewery, but I swear, the contents support the accolades. One of the definitive standards of the style out there right now. Don't let the dirt roads deter you. 686 charactersppoitras, Aug 21, 2012

A- this guy looks amazing, dark brown with a nice chocolate brown head, you know this will be a treat.
S- at first it's very muted but as it warms you get nice chocolate, some roasted and sweet malts. This is going to be good.
T- this one packs huge flavors! Lots of chocolate upfront, perfect amount of roastiness. The flavors are all melded together very well. Each sip beckons another. Funny enough the after taste is fantastic!
M- I believe this is why hf beers succeed. You can tell right away they strived for the perfect mouthfeel, and this one is near perfect. Nice thick body that's like velvet on the tongue. The flavors really stick to the mouth. Delicious
O- this beer is damn good. One of the better porters out there for sure. If your a porter fan it doesn't get much better, this is a must. I need to try more hf. I need to try the ba version 1,018 charactersKevSal, Aug 18, 2012

A: Pours jet black, while I didnt make it too hard of a poor, hardly any tan head appears, just a rim that disappates pretty quickly.
S: Chocolate, Coffee, Roasted Malts, a hint of Vanilla. No real booze smell as expected for a 7.5%.
T: As it smells, everything comes through quite nicely. Very balanced porter, a slight hop biterness comes through that reminds me a little of Founders Imperial Stout.
M: Full bodied, mild carbonation. Very rich
O: Absolutely wonderful porter, especially given that its readily available at the brewery from what I hear. I could drink plenty of these and drink them often. Another stellar beer from HFS. 720 charactersBeRanger, Aug 13, 2012

A strong coffee note upfront with a nice bit of chocolate and sweet brown sugar to back it up. A smokey charred note gives you a preview of the robustness to come. 
An explosion of flavor takes place with the first sip and it takes a while to really understand everything that is going on here. Certainly the coffee notes play a major role but the sweetness of the carmel malts adds a nice touch. Roasted notes come through in a wave of smokey flavors and leaves you with a lingering bitterness that allows the hops to come into play as well. 
Mouthfeel is creamy and rich. Certainly makes this a nice sipper for a damp and dark night. Overall, I had pretty high expectations coming into this beer as I consider the standard robust porter (i.e. non-imperialized or flavored) to be one of my favorite styles. Everett met all those expectation and exceeded them in some parts and is only going to make the 100 mile drive to the brewery all the more tempting. 1,070 charactersKinsman, Jul 29, 2012

Poured a black coffee hue with a finger of khaki colored head.
The aroma was fresh espresso beans ground with fresh coffee beans, cocoa and vanilla.
Taste follows the nose. This brew tastes so fresh! Like a delicious fresh brewed espresso with some cocoa and vanilla. Amazing!
The mouth feel is medium bodied but full in flavor. A moderate amount of carbonation... I really feel like it complimented the beer perfectly. Drying roasty espresso finish. So money!

A - Pours deep brown, might as well be black, with a nice one and a half finger tall mocha colored head leaving thin trails of lace down parts of the glass.
S - Smells of chocolate, coffee, molasses, licorice and plenty of dark roasted malts. A bit of smoke comes through as it sits in the glass. Very nice nose.
T - Starts off with a ton of sweet dark roasted flavors - namely coffee, chocolate and molasses - slowly giving way to some of the other flavors - licorice, smoke and a bit of dark fruit. The dark roasted malt is ever present. Finish is quite roasty but the smooth feel really helps to keep things in check.
M - Big, smooth body with a ton of dark flavors and moderate carbonation. Nice creamy feel brings everything together.
O - I could drink this beer every day no problem. It possesses all of the flavors I look for in a dark beer and the execution is nearly flawless. This deserves all of the praise it receives. 996 charactersorangesol, Jul 23, 2012

It pours an almost pitch black rich liquid that bubbles out a nice 1 finger darker colored head, creamy head that fades semi slowly with a decent lacing on the glass.
NOse explodes with chocolate and caramel, some baker's and a slight dark chocolate, plenty of caramel, a hint of roast and coffee, a chewy malt base with a hint of oats, a nice big meaty dark malt profile that really pumps up the beer. And somewhere in the middle of all that comes very light earthy hops.
Taste comes on with waves of smooth rich malts, lots of chocolate, a bit of dark chocolate, baker's, and plenty of creamy milk chocolate. A light roasted malt profile, bringing a hint of coffee with it, and I think a touch of black patent malt. Plenty of caramel comes through with the waves, and brings just a touch of bready like malts that, with the chocolate, give a malted milk ball taste. Some creamy flavors with a lactose like feel and maybe hint of oats. There is an earthy slightly bitter hop taste in the background that let's the malts speak. The finish is fairly dry with a long lingering chocolate flavor, fair amount of earthy bitterness, light lingering roast and caramel.
Mouth is fuller bodied, rich and creamy, decent carb.
Overall very nice, quite drinkable with lots of great malts that taste great and make me want more with each sip. The booze is mostly hidden, and the earthy hops give just enough bitterness to prop up the malts so they can shine. Almost a perfect porter, delicious. 1,582 charactersjlindros, Jul 22, 2012

Appearance: Pours a dark brown, almost black with a 1/2 finger light tan head. Decent lacing.
Smell: Roasted coffee, chocolate, toasted malt and white bread crust.
Taste: Milk chocolate, roasted malt and coffee throughout. Aftertaste is bitter coffee with a touch of sweet chocolate. Extremely well-balanced. Excellent flavor.
Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation.
Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. I could drink this all day.
Overall: Excellent beer overall. Maybe the best porter (it's really close to a milk stout in my opinion) I've ever had. It's extremely well-balanced and smooth.

Pours a deep foreboding black. Heavy and scary looking. A great finger width of luscious mocha-head rests atop. The nose is rich with roasted malt, coffee grounds, dark breads, molasses. Well-rounded aroma invites me to partake. 
For the style, the feel holds up wonderfully. Velvety chewy mouth with a moderately-full heft to it. This is not an easy drinker, and that's fine by me. Holds up the decadence of the flavors perfectly. The beer is overflowing with rich, malty goodness. Roasted coffee stands out, followed by a not-unpleasant burst of charred bread. Semi-sweet chocolate, cut oats on the finish. Fantastic Porter. One of the best. I'd love to have this one again. 799 charactersOnenote81, Jul 16, 2012

A: Extremely dark brown in color with essentially no visible carbonation. Forms only a moderate tan head - but the head has quite a thick, sticky foamy consistency.
S: Chocolate, caramel, slight bacon smoke, vanilla. This smells pretty roasty.
T: This is likely one of the most complex porters I've ever had. Chocolate, cacao, mocha, toffee, vanilla, dark spicy, all with roasted malt. There is just a touch of (hickory?) smoke mid-swallow, especially if I exhale. There is sweetness near the end but a still has a drying finish.
M: The alcohol is nearly unnoticeable. This has an amazing, thick creamy mouthfeel.
O: This is really well done. I'm not generally a big fan of any smoke flavor, but the smokiness here is subtle and compliments rather than overpowers the other flavors. A nice touch & not enough to detract. My first Hill Farmstead brew, but I hope the first of many. 964 charactersmacrosmatic, Jul 08, 2012

S: Some roasted malt and barley, chocolate, a little coffee. There is some caramel and a slight sweetness to it, almost like a milk stout. 
T: Very roasty, but in a really good way. There is a nice underlying chocolate/creamy sweetness that balances this beer. As it warms more chocolate comes out. Very tasty. 
M: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly dry finish. Extremely smooth and easy drinking.

4.06/5  rDev -9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4500 mL bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead tulip. No bottle date.
Appearance - Pours a black body that is translucent at the edges. Billowing mocha head that almost overflows the glass. Excellent retention and even some nice lacing.
Smell - Chocolate and coffee dominate. Some booze, which is surprising for 7.5%. A deep, ashy, almost burnt character persists in the background, perhaps detracting from other aromas.
Taste - Coffee and chocolate are the most dominant flavors. It really mirrors the aromas, even in the relative proportions of the flavors. The finish is bitter, but seemingly from that ashy burnt character. Again, it's slightly boozy.
Mouthfeel - I had this on tap and it seemed much heavier and more viscous than it does in the bottle. It's medium bodied, but slick on the tongue. The bitter ashy finish is a little detracting, but otherwise it's good.
Overall - I don't find this to be earth-shattering as the reviews suggest. It's still a solid and impressive beer. Yet another technical masterpiece from Hill Farmstead, but lacking in a certain refinement that their other beers have. 1,110 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 23, 2012

I can almost confidently call this beer black, but could be brown in color. Its certainly brown with deep amber highlights on the side of the glass. Nice tan colored HUGE head with various sized bubbles. There were a good deal of big bubble pockets and this beer produced an excellent amount of lacing. A really good looking porter, pretty close to being flawless. 
Smell is really really freaking good. Malts come right at you. Rich chocolate malts and caramel as well, the blend gives a slight coffee aroma. Hops are present, herbal and floral combination. Much sweeter than I expected, but at the same time it really is robust. However it's robust in a subtle sort of way if that makes sense. 
Big props to Kevin for bringing this back from VT, you're the freaking man!
Taste is equally as excellent. Again with the rich chocolate flavor. You can taste caramel, chocolate and pale malts pretty distinctively. Roasted barley comes out because it certainly has a roasty flavor. You really can't get enough of the flavor. There's a nice hop finish to the flavor that's a bit earthy, but not overly bitter. 
Mouthfeel is perfect, straight up. It's silky smooth, a great carbonation level and a perfect balance between bitter and sweet. It's amazing the amount of flavor compact into this beer while at the same time being this smooth and drinkable. Overall this is truly a wonderful porter a great example of the style. Top notch version of an American Porter. 1,522 charactersAndyAvalanche, Jun 20, 2012

A: Black with 2 finger tan frothy head. Lots of lacing. Beautiful looking porter!
S: Unlike most American porters (in general), this one has a huge smell. Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt. 
T: WOW... amazing flavours that don't quit (very long lasting bold taste). It starts with coffee, roasted malt, then finishes with chocolate and slight hop bitterness at the end (but not too bitter). Some smoke to in the after taste. This is the most complex and tasty porter I have ever had. 
M: I would say, for the style, the beer is quite thick and syrupy (but not thick and syrupy like a imperial stout). Creamy. Good amount of carbonation.

Ooh, this smells nice. Coffee roasty notes, some dark chocolate, a touch of smoke, and a rich sweetness underlying it all. To put it simply, this smells like what every porter should smell like (IMO). Complex, but all the elements link together so well. Creamy, smooth, and just perfectly integrated. Wow.
Taste is less complete, and, hmm, just thinner than the smell. Much more smoke and heavily roasted stuff, and much less of the sweetness and choco-coffee goodness. Very dark and rather burned. Drifts into bitter char through the finish.
Mouthfeel is quite good. Silky smoth, creamy, mmm nice. Medium-heavy body, but enough carbonation to make it both fluffy and chewy. Lasting finish, carrying those charcoal flavors along with it.
I'm really curious about this beer, as it smells perfect, but the taste doesn't come close. Where's that subtle balance of sweetness and smoky roast? I still like it, but dang, if it tasted like it smells, it would probably be my all-time favorite porter. 1,117 characterszeledonia, Jun 13, 2012

A wonderful creamy mocha cocoa brown and light chocolate head, forms really nicely, settling down to a nice three finger controlled head, some swiss cheese character, but mostly even on bubble size. Lots of valleys and retention in the head. Body is a nice dark dark walnut brown getting near black, almost red hue, slight red hues even for the entire body, a little bit of flake of yeast at the bottom not a lot, and some rising carbonation but you really have to look. Really sexy looking beer.
A great nose on this brew just flat out wonderful. Coffee, warm chocolate, wonderful milk cream, and roasting malts. Great chocolate sense, rich creamy dark chocolate, milky sensations with cream egging on the coffee angle and nice small sweetness. Just flat out wonderful and great.
Taste is just unreal. One of the most perfectly balanced beers for its style it seems, knocking out flavors that some Russian Imperials could only dream of. Fantastic chocolate sensations, and dry malts, with tobacco mixing finishes. Thick body rich without syrup and a light porter body. Creamy unbelievable mouthfeel with still a light body, in just a hint .. a hint of playful carbonation. I don't know how they got that. Coffee and chocolate is just EVERYWHERE on the palate. Even a small lingering hop so faint. 
This brew is literally the definition of every taste and beer component done to perfection, and balanced so nicely. This is hands down the best porter I have ever had to date. I haven't had every Porter imaginable, but this is a practicaly working definition of the "perfect" beer. 1,632 characterssmakawhat, Jun 08, 2012

Hill Farmstead Everett, 9-oz glass at Sunswick 35/35 in Astoria, Queens, New York.
Appearance: About a finger worth of mocha-colored head that lasts and lasts. Great pitch-black looks, menacing but inviting. Persistent lacing and tingly carbonation. 
Smell: Smooth, hard to pin. Tad of hops. Bitterness, chocolate, high-end bakery. 
Taste: Very roasty-bitter, chocolaty at the end of the sip. Liquid smoke and burnt sugar. Licuorice, nice spicy-hoppy feel in the lips. Coffee all around. 
Mouthfeel: A little watery-thin, but good rich-creamy feel nonetheless. Low carbonation and body, medium flavor. Dry finish. 
Overall: A good porter indeed, mighty drinkable despite the hefty ABV. Probably better than most American Porters, but not up to the standard-bearer: Founders Porter. 983 charactersDoubleSimcoe, May 29, 2012

Score: 94
Opening a 750 ml growler that I received about a week ago from the overly generous Jason Richard. Served in a Darkness snifter and enjoyed on 03/28/12. Review is from notes.
Appearance: Pours a black coffee color with just over a finger of creamy mocha colored head that quickly settles into a bubbly ring around the glass and foggy thin layer that caps off just over 50 percent of the beer. Superior lacing, above average retention. 4.5/5
Smell: Smokey roasted chocolate, dark chocolate and bittersweet baking chocolate morsels. Roasted oat, a little caramel and modest espresso/dark roast coffee. A light dose of piney hops too. 4/5
Taste: Just as much smokey roasted chocolate on the palate as the aroma led on. Toffee, light caramel and plenty of dry dark/raw chocolate with a smooth chocolatey finish. The beer is not very complex, but it's a luscious medley of creamy chocolate flavors throughout. Truly delightful. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Full-medium bodied, low carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. Dry and modestly bitter finish. 4.5/5
Overall: Quite possibly the best everyday porter that I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Very roasty/smokey and chocolate-forward.
Recommendation: Everyone should seek out a bottle of this stuff.
Pairings: Ice cream sundae.
Cost: $8 for a 500 ml bottle, $8 for a 750 ml growler or $16 for a 2 liter growler (plus the deposit). 1,436 charactersjegross2, May 28, 2012

Nose is very nice, very pleasant roasted nuttiness along with robust coffee. A touch of bitter chocolate or cacao. 
Flavor is just what it represents, Robust. Great flavor with big roastiness. Roasted nuts and coffee with dark bitter chocolate. A touch a vanilla hidden in there. 
Mouthfeel is fantastic. Velvety smooth like a nice stout. Medium bodied with medium creamy carb. A touch dry.

reviewed from notes taken on 5/23/12.
Appearance: black bodied beer with a dark brown head. Nice lacing from this beer.
Smell: Great smelling porter! Roasty malts, milk chocolate, hint of caramel, light smoke, hint of peat and earthiness. This is what the best porter in the world smells like!
Taste: This porter starts off with a lite bitterness from roasty malts; then some sweetness in the form of lots of premuim milk chocolates and hints of caramel, brown sugar and maybe even some molasses. A hint of earthy hops in the middle, that are reminicent of the flavor contributed by an oak barrel. In the finish, you get some light meaty smoke and very mild char/ashen notes that linger in the background with a nice mellow and sweet milk chocolates finish. As this beer warms up, the level of roastiness intensifies in a fairly aggressive manner. Which is actually very nice. This is what the best porter in the world tastes like.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer and almost moderate carbonation levels with a smooth, silky, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is damn near perfect and really inhances the drinking experience of this beer. This porter is so very very drinkable; drinks like its a 5% beer. Not a hint of booze. This is how the best porter in the world feels on your palate.
Overall: A great tasting porter thats very flavorful, complex, and overall a really well balanced beer in both flavor profile and aroma. Very well executed mouthfeel. This is my very first Hill Farmstead beer. All I have got to say is WOW... I am extremely impressed with this brewery based on thier execution this of beer. I can see why people talk so highly of this brewery. This is the easily the very best Porter in the world; no other porter even comes close to the bar set by Everett. Seriously! 1,869 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, May 25, 2012

Smells awesome!! Just a clean earthy coffee/mild chocolate.
Chocolate cocoa upfront, some faint coffee notes. Semi Sweet aftertaste. So smooth with the ABV.
Mouthfeel is right up there with the best of them. Full, creamy...all the best descriptors. Medium carbonation, just right.
This was just awesome. It's rare that some that isn't "imperial" gets a ratin this high, both from me and everyone else. Wonderful Hill Farmstead. Thanks for sharing egrace84. 583 charactersDuff27, May 24, 2012

Huge thanks to fellow BeerAdvocate for going to the HF release party to pick up a growler for me. Pours dark brown with a nice one and a half finger khaki head with beautiful lacing that lasted throughout. Aromas of grain, oatmeal, coffee, and some vanilla. Flavors of grain, wood, some alcohol and chocolate. Gosh, this beer sure reminded me of Founders Porter, but only better! There are some light bitterness throughout the session. Thick bodied with good carbonation. Nice sticky mouthfeel. Though good, wasn’t world class as many beer raters gave it. 626 charactersCuriousMonk, May 16, 2012

A- Pours a dark brown with a thin off white head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving minimal lacing. 
S- Quite smoky upfront, with dark chocolate, burnt caramel, roasted malt, and some smoked meat. 
T- Luckily the meaty aroma isn't in the taste. Again smoke is prominent with dark chocolate, burnt caramel, roasted malt, char and cocoa powder.
M- Medium carbonation and a creamy full body. The best aspect of the beer and something that Hill Farmstead always impress me with.
O- A unique take on the porter with the smokiness, but the smoke presence was a bit overwhelming. Still good, but not one of my favorites from HF. 700 charactersiadler, May 12, 2012
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4500ml bottle into a snifter. I'm not sharing this one!
A: Pours dark brown a shade away of black with two and a half fingers of dense tan foam. Retention and lacing are superb.
S: Lots of heavily roasted malts with a bit of dark chocolate and a good amount of hoppiness.
T: Smooth roasted malts combine with bitter hops and dark chocolate. Roastiness rules, though. Subtle smoke comes out as the beer warms. Very light caramel and milk chocolate sweetness help to balance, but this beer is certainly more on the roasty and hoppy side. 
M: Medium bodied with creamy carbonation.
O: An extremely well done American Porter. No crazy flavors or ingredients, but a delicious roasty character and no flaws whatsoever, just like pretty much all of Shaun's beers. 760 characterscoreyfmcdonald, May 12, 2012

S: Lots of roastiness. I definitely smell some coffee and rich chocolate goodness.
T: Wow. It's a fuller bodied porter. It's creamy. Lots of roast and bitter dark chocolate. Also a touch of roast coffee is there too. I also get a touch of hop bite, piney.
M: Medium bodied, but leading to full.

S: Big coffee roast dominates the nose. Some chocolate and dark malt, a hint of sweet hops, with a metallic note on the end.
T: Milk and dark chocolate, earthy coffee beans, big lactic sweetness, a bit of piney hop, caramel, slightly bitter roasted barley. Great balance between sweetness and bitterness/roastiness. Sweet coffee lingers.
M: Amazing mouthfeel: rich, thick, creamy, just enough carbonation. Perfect.

Everett pours a medium bodied black chocolate darkest of browns with a one finger dark beige head. It certainly looks the part. The nose is robust. There are loads of bitter chocolate, lightlly roasted coffee, and more bitter chocolate. It's vibrant for a porter. The flavors lead with bitter chocolate and tobacco with plenty of coffee roast. There's a whole lot of roast, and a whole lot of chocolate. The flavors are strong in this one. I hate using this descriptor, but the aftertaste is robust. I really enjoy this one. It's definitely a full flavor porter. Yet another nice beer from HF. 653 charactersaasher, May 07, 2012

Thanks, AdamJackson!
Black throughout with a small dark brown head. Surprisingly, this leaves the glass relatively clean on the way down.
A very rich, roasty aroma. There's a bit of chocolate and a hint of coffee, but this is a showcase of powerful, roasted malt character.
The flavor follows similarly. This is a complete, delicious, incredibly drinkable robust porter. The flavors consist of roasted malt, a bit of cocoa, slight coffee, and moderate bitterness. No alcohol presence.
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
A delicious, classic, to-style porter. 597 charactersehammond1, May 03, 2012

A: Pours a dark clear brown with frothy mocha head. Great retention leaves some lacing around glass.
S: Loaded with toasted malt and hints of cocoa and coffee. Hop and alcohol presence are both faint. As it warms the 7.5% ABV becomes more apparent.
T: Taste follows the aroma with rich lightly roasted malt and some chocolate. Sweetness is balanced by above average hop bitterness for a porter. A mild herbal hop flavor and some alcohol come through more towards the finish.
M: Body is on the fuller side of medium with moderate carbonation. Finishes semi-dry with some bitterness
O: Nice, rich flavorful porter, good drinkability but I feel a bit less bitterness would make this dangerously easy drinking. Another solid offering from Hill Farmstead. 824 charactersAzurescens, Apr 30, 2012
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Black with a khaki head. 
Aroma is primarily dark chocolate and mocha, with a touch of oat. 
It's flavor brings, more specifically, Nuttela to mind as favors nuts and dark chocolate meld. There is also a touch of slightly acidic vanilla bean on the finish. 
Mouthfeel is full, primarily creamy, yet a little slick on the finish. 
Overall it's hard to find fault here as its extremely enjoyable. If it had more notes for earth, wood, it might be perch. Who knows, maybe that would muddle the favors. I'm being picky though as I would never turn this down. One of the best porters I've ever had. 595 charactersjbertsch, Apr 30, 2012

Excellent porter here. Dark brown pour with mahogany tints around the edges, nice finger-plus of fluffy tan head that receded to a thin layer, leaving nice quad-style lacing on the glass. Roasty aroma, scents of dark malts, coffee, toasted grains. Robust and hearty! The taste followed the aroma pretty spot-on, roasted dark malts, pumpernickel, smooth coffee, hearty toasted grains, and just enough brown sugar sweetness to take off whatever edge might have been caused by the dominant roastiness, without offsetting the overall equilibrium. Nice heavy-medium body, tremendously drinkable. Had to bring a 750ml growler home from the source. I don't believe a porter can get any better than this. No nonsense. Exemplary! 771 charactersRifugium, Apr 24, 2012

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and some slight cocoa and coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has a really roasty flavor without being too harsh. 554 charactersUCLABrewN84, Apr 17, 2012

a bit more of a lactose-like sweetness in the bottled version than I remember in my few experiences from the growler. tons of dark roasted coffee, bitter cacao, some roasted/candied nuts, vanilla extract, and roasted malts obviously. I think my experiences from the growler have shown more of a charred/cacao powder aroma, while the bottle shows a bit more sweetness.
flavor just does not quit. I have only taken a small sip so far and can pick up so many flavors its ridiculous. cacao, coffee, roasted nuts, vanilla, molasses, burnt brown sugar, woody and earthy hops. just amazing.
a bit lighter bodied than an imperial stout, but perfect for a robust porter. carbonation is there, but remains in the background. no alcohol heat or burn. 
growler, on tap, or in bottles, this is THE porter to compare all other porters to. Can't wait for the barrels to mature, because I can only imagine what some bourbon character could add to this beer. 1,057 characterssilentjay, Apr 08, 2012

Dark ruby garnet with a good creamy brown head. Good retention and lacing.
Aroma is dominated by roast followed by malts and a pungent tartness. The tartness is fortunately absent in the taste. Strongly roasty with intense dark chocolate, subtle grain and a hint of citrus hops.
Obscure smokiness that comes through strongly once in a while. Slightly warming minus the booze. Dry finish with a lingering roasted beans aftertaste.
Perfect level of carbonation... enough to carry the beer without compromising the silkiness. Very well designed and executed beer. 587 characterstewaris, Apr 05, 2012

Good retention of the lace as well. Aroma, dark chocolate, solid, but not substantial roast aroma, didn't really get much if anything in the way of coffee. 
Taste, pretty smooth, like there's a bunch of oatmeal used. Very smooth, very rich. I think there's a little touch of vanilla in there. Or maybe its caramel I'm tasting and that's helping with the smoothness, not a robust porter in the sense its a highly hopped one, it really just lays something down smooth. Alcohol hid well. Carbonation is spot on. Frankly, I don't really see what is robust, its really good and all, but not because it is robust or in your face, its nice because its a smooth operator. 
One of the better porters I've had in awhile. Unless you count the BBXXIII as a true porter. . . this is a very good non bal porter. 893 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Mar 21, 2012

*From notes
-- Thanks & cheers, Eric --
A: A rich, robust chocolate brown. A good pour yields a one finger head. As it fades, decent lacing and a fair collar follow.
S: Quite green, with a good bit of coffee injecting life into the nose.
T: Thin. Watery. Cardboard. These aren't qualities that I look for in a beer, let alone a Porter from Hill Farmstead. This isn't infected or off, it's just not up to snuff with a lot of the better Porters on the market. Extremely underwhelming.
M: It feels alright, I guess. The carbonation isn't where I feel it should be, as it's (yet again) a bit thin and not overly complex or rich in the mouth.
O: How anti-climactic. HF's Everett is one of the biggest letdowns I've come across in some time. The rest of the tasting group bought into the hype with this and rather enjoyed it. But me....nah. It's simply a Porter. 912 charactersRhettroactive, Mar 19, 2012

Looks black, but some light shines through. Head leaves minimal lacing.

Taste is heavy on the chocolate. Some burnt black malt flavors. Dark caramel. I don't really taste any coffee here. Light bitterness in the finish.
Medium mouthfeel. Just right for a porter.
This is a solid porter. Not sure if it's the hop notes or the burnt caramel flavors I pick up, but it's a bit different than some other porters. Not a bad thing. 532 charactersmusicforairports, Mar 18, 2012

Review taken from notes. 
A - This beer pours a very dark brown color. There is a little more than a finger of dark tan head resting on top. The head has good retention, and there is some nice scattered lace left behind on the glass.
S - The nose has a nice big dark roasted malt aroma. There are some other nice scents of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, some caramel, and it little touch of booze.
T - The taste follows the nose quite well. It starts off with a big dark roasted malt flavor. Coffee and dark chocolate also stand out well. There are also some flavors of vanilla, some caramel, mild hops, and a little bit of booziness. The finish leaves some lingering roasted malt, coffee, mild hops, and a touch of booze. 
M - This has just about a full body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a little bit of a chewy quality to it. There is a good amount of initial sweetness and a bold roasted malt bitterness that makes it balance out quite well. There is also a really mild hop bitterness and a touch of boozy warmth. 
O - This has good drinkability. It has great flavor and goes down easy. It has a nice balance between roasted bitterness and sweetness. Overall, I think this is a good beer and a really nice example of the style. I really enjoyed this beer, and I recommend trying it out. I would buy it again. 1,375 charactersJizackFH, Mar 12, 2012

4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The pour is dark, near black with a small amount of head and lacing. Has a pleasant nose of vanilla and chocolate.
Taste is robust with a myriad of well integrated flavors including chocolate, coffee and vanilla in one roasty package. The back end has a smidge of bitterness adding another level of complexity.
Silky smooth mouthfeel on this bad boy. Perfect carbonation level as you are drinking this.
This is unquestionably a robust beer. Anyone brewing a porter should use this as a baseline. Definitely try this one if you haven't already. 546 charactersmetalgdog, Mar 09, 2012
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Pony Bar NYC. A lovely porter, one of the best I’ve ever had. 
Deep, dark brown color, bordering on black, with a small brown head that settles slowly, leaving nice lacing. Roasty aroma with notes of chocolate, vanilla, light coffee and smoke. Smells faintly sweet as well. All of this is present in the taste as well, with the standard roast malt, espresso and bittersweet chocolate notes and a subtle, delightful vanilla flavor. Perhaps a touch of maple syrup? Bitterness and hop character is very restrained but still noticeable lurking under the more prominent flavors. Sweeter and creamier than is usual for the style. No booziness. Mouthfeel is medium to on the full side for a porter, with moderate carbonation and an exceptionally smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I really enjoyed the somewhat restrained carbonation as I’m not the biggest fan of porters with prickly carbonation. 
Overall a tremendous beer, my first from Hill Farmstead, and certain to not be my last. 989 characterstobelerone, Mar 08, 2012
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a bottle of this on my first visit to HF. Got to try a sample of some great beer. This one was very good, so here's an official review...
A: Yep, absolutely perfect. A super pitch black brew with a thick pour. This leads to a huge 2 inch mocha colored fluffy had that fades at a decent pace to a small lake atop the brew.
S: I first get some sweet chocolate on the nose which blends into a mild hop scent which leads to some burnt coffee notes. I get vanilla and very faint raisin on the back. Very good.
T: I get a full thick bitter chocolate upfront which blends into a roasty vanilla coffee. Good.
M: Full body with a good carbonation. A roasty finish. Very good.
O: All in all, this is a very good robust porter. With this type of beer you would expect a fullness with a nice roastiness. This meets and exceeds the criteria. Definitely enjoy this one if you like a nice roasty porter. 903 characterssteve8robin, Mar 06, 2012

Pouring black with a dense, crema-colored head with excellent retention and some lacing, this is a beautiful porter.The nose is just as good. Big, robust, roasted malt character with dashes of chocolate and caramel, this is pretty much what I'd expect from a robust porter.The chocolate character on the nose is particularly alluring, with a blend of milk chocolate and cream. The roasted barley adds an aggressive roast note, with mild smoky, burnt grain characteristic that's at the perfect level. And of course, there's plenty of medium-dark roast coffee aromas, fresh and complex. There's a mild, earthy hop character as well. Excellent.
The palate is perfect. With an excellent blend of aggressive roasted malt (barley in this case) bitterness, dark chocolate and a touch of caramel sweetness, this is really tasty. The dark chocolate character is pretty phenomenal, and it also has some coffee flavors. Drying and roasty on the finish with a some caramel sweetness, there's some vanilla that's also present here. As it warms up, the chocolate and coffee come to the forefront, and the alcohol begins to peek. Just a touch of licorice as well, on the finish, and I could swear I taste a little anise. Medium in body with medium-low carbonation, this is soft and luscious on the palate. Perfectly carbonated, this is near-perfect on the palate but for a fleeting moment of wateriness on the mid-palate. The caramel sweetness on the finish grows increasingly noticeable over the course of a growler, making the 750ml quite easily the perfect serving size. That said, it is nowhere near as sweet as some of the new-age porters and stouts out there (RRBC Porter, Eclipse, etc)
An outstanding porter, quite easily the best I've had. While not as robust (read: bitter) as the Smuttynose Robust Porter, and better conditioned than Ed Fitz, both of which make this insanely enjoyable. 1,924 charactersDefenCorps, Feb 27, 2012

S - Excellent aromas here with strong chocolate and coffee along with vanilla and roasted malts. So, so inviting.

M - Mouthfeel is excellent, nice and silky velvety smooth. So enjoyable.

Thanks to CliffBrake for this one
Shared with GuruDel..."Thats a good porter"
App- If this wasnt one of the most dark and lush porters I have seen than I dont know what it. Super dark brown, like a good coffee with some rich crimson edges. Nice 1-1/2" head with a nice khaki head that fell with great cling lines.
Smell- A bit of a stout/porter mix. A bit grainular with some coffee, toast, roast, earthy and chocolatey notes.
Taste- Opens very smooth with a good amount of grain, oatmeal, roast, bitter and chocolate. The beer is very well layered with each flavors coming with the next. Roasty flows into the chocolate magically to create a velvet smoothness.
Mouth- Almost thick bodied and bordering on oatmeal stout territory and a almost full carbonation level, just leaves this creamy chocolatey flavor.
Drink- "Thats a good porter" says GuruDel. He is the porter man and this did not dissapoint in the slightest. Very layered. Very smooth and rich. I would love this closer to CA. 1,054 charactersFosterJM, Feb 03, 2012

4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a snifter.
With a fairly aggressive pour, there is a nice, tightly wound mocha brown cap. The head retains nicely and leaves some nice spotty lace all over the glass.
The aroma and flavor are both very smooth. Dark roasted malt contains dark semi-sweet chocolate and creamy espresso flavor with no smokey or burnt character. The flavor starts with that malt, and the malt and chocolate linger through the middle of the flavor, ending with a semi-sweet creamy espresso note. There is a soft spicy pine hop note right at the end. 
The mouthfeel is worth noting separately. The flavors integrate well with the smooth body and creamy carbonation.
I haven't been impressed with the Hill Farmstead beers I have had so far, but this was very impressive. At this point I would say it is one of the best porters I have had. 851 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jan 23, 2012

4.46/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 500ml bottle into my Dogfish snifter. It poured black in color with a thick, frothy tan head filling the top inch of the glass. great head retention and lacing as I drank it. Couldn't really ask anything more for the style. 
The aroma has some milk chocolaty, caramel flavors to it. I get a little of a milk stout, sweeter, lactose like quality out of it as well. Very light on the roasty, darker malts compared to how much come through in the taste. 
The taste shows a little more of the dark, bitter-sweet chocolate and caramel flavors to it up front. In the finish is where more of the roasty, bitter, slightly burnt malts come out. Great balance between the sweet, chocolaty and roasty, bitterness. 
The mouthfeel is heavy and creamy with carbonation being a little below average. Great mouthfeel for the style. Overall it was a great beer. Tons of flavor to it and very well balanced. It wasn't a beer that completely blew me away or offered something completely unique for the style, it was just a fantastic tasting, well made porter. Great beer overall.
Update: Such a different beer from the growler I had on 3/10/12. Much more coffee and roasted qualities in the aroma. More lactose and caramel sweetness in the taste with a strong coffee presence. Very good, but I liked the bottle version I had a few months ago better. 1,348 charactersbillab914, Jan 21, 2012

The body is thick, like a robust porter should be, but is a pleasure to sip (though you don't have to). In addition to a big mix of cocoa and mocha grains, there are clear notes of maple syrup, molasses, and smoke. Damn, this is good. It goes above and beyond what a good porter tastes like. 361 characterstempest, Jan 14, 2012

4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to angrybabboon for finding and sharing the bottle.
Appearance: Very dark brown, almost black in places depending on the light. Creamy crema head. Specks of lacing. Head dwindles to a ring that persists. Pours nice and thick.
Smell: Loads and loads of chocolate, both malt and something that smells added and real. Ranges from milk down to gritty, almost bitter baker's chocolate. Definite sweetness. Some grainy/grassy notes. Touch of minerals. Smells kind of like sticking your nose in a vat of chocolate full of rocks. Some burnt and toasted malts bring the whole thing together.
Taste: Tastes like fresh espresso and chocolate. Nice compliment of roasted malts. Sweetness is present and works well with the touch of rocks and earth. So many malts. Chocolate is off the wall. Slightly smoky. Some char and burnt notes.
Mouthfeel: Medium body. Borders on full as it warms...is that possible? Touch dry at edges. Smooth with a gritty edge. Carbonation is solid. 
Overall: Very nice take on the style. I'd say it leans more English than American. Tons of chocolate and nice depth. Hill Farmstead never disapoints. 1,130 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 12, 2012

a - Pours a pitch black color with 2 inches of dark tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Little bit of head stays throughout drinking it. Looks pretty great.
s - Smells of roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, vanilla, toasted malts, milk chocolate, light fruit, lightly burnt malts. Very nice roasty nose, and a nice amount of vanilla and chocolate.
t - Tastes of roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, smoke, burnt malts, sweet chocolate, and very light vanilla. Taste has more coffee than the nose and less vanilla, a little bit of a smokey quality to it. Very nice, though a step down from the nose for me.
m - Medium body and low to moderate carbonation. Very smooth and creamy, an awesome mouthfeel.
o - Overall a great beer and porter. Looks great, has a great mouthfeel, and a wonderful nose. Not my favorite tasting porter but certainly still good, and felt like I could have drank the whole bottle myself. Another good beer from these guys; verye xcited for EBF to try some more from them. 1,158 charactersmdfb79, Jan 10, 2012

The beer is dark brown, verging on black, with a gargantuan, soapy, beige head that coats the tumbler with lacing. The aroma offers chocolates, roast, malt, dark chocolates, hints of coffee. Great flavor. Really smooth. Not overpowering or exceptionally bold, but rather, well balanced, easy drinking, and highly enjoyable.

Prominent aroma, as is typical for Hill Farmstead beers, of roasted grains, coffee, chocolate. Very inviting.
Full flavor of roasted grains, a bit of charcoal and coffee with suggestions of stone fruit. A touch of sweetness resolving into a bitter dry finish. 
Mouthfeel is full, velvety and smooth, but with just the right amount of carbonation to keep from getting heavy and bogged down.
I have not tried all of the top rated porters yet, but I have enjoyed this style for a long time and would hold this out as the standard to measure other porters against. This is especially true as this is not enhanced by vanilla, coffee, maple, bacon, or other additives. Everett achieves its great flavor and complexity with just hops, malt and yeast. 860 charactersCliffBrake, Jan 08, 2012

A: Pours a Dark Black/Brown with a tan head. 
S: Aroma is Dark Chocolate, Roast, rich coffee. Thick and creamy in the mouth,
T: Taste is dry roasted and chocolaty with just the right amount of clean spicy/citrusy hop profile as to not take away from the important elements of this porter. Flavor is a dark swirl of chocolate, burnt wood, light twinge of smoke, coffee. The list could go on and on, a very deep beer

A- Black with a thick creamy mocha tan head. Good size and retention. Endless lacing it seems.
S- Not as strong as I expected. Cocoa powder, coffee beans, roast malts and a vanilla hint. Mostly malt here.
T- Follows the nose and starts with a rich blend of chocolate chips, coffee, black malts, slight smoke and some dark fruit. Earthy hops are moderate in strength and round it out.
MF- Silky carbonation in a moderate and smooth amount. Finished with cocoa powder bitters and some hop feel.
Awesome porter with a rich and dark flavorful feel. More hops than I remember but that balances it nicely. Russian River is the only one off the top of my head that rewlly beats this. 701 characterscbutova, Dec 30, 2011

Taste: So, so good - tons of chocolate, tons of burnt, char, some coffee - kind of like semisweet chocolate - slightly sweet, nicely dry - nicely balanced, decadent - so good - some vanilla, espresso, licorice
Mouthfeel: Medium, smooth, nicely carbonated
Overall: Robust, to say the least
This was my first Hill Farmstead (aside from some samples), and it was a good place to start. It's also the kind of beer that makes me question the distinction between a porter and a stout. Because in my opinion, this is a stout. And a great one.
Update: 1/17/15
Drinking a growler fresh from the brewery (filled today). And honestly, it's even better than I remember. I'm upping the taste from 4 to 4.5 and the feel from 4 to 4.25. This is one of the best porters I've ever had. 1,065 charactersangrybabboon, Dec 13, 2011

Bottle to pint glass
Thanks to CharlieMurphy for sending this amongst other HF treats in a wonderful trade! First American Craft Beer from my stash cracked on this side of the pond.
A: Deep black. 3+ (brilliantly dark tan) fingernail head on gentle pour. Needed to give it a minute or two for the head to dissipate before taking my first sip.
S: Roasty and charred. Coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malt.
T: Very roasty, charred, and coffee-esque with a slight hint of caramel/vanilla. Well done here!
M: Definitely full bodied for a porter. Loads of carbonation.
O: Most enjoyable and just awesome! Stoked to have this as a beer that reminds me of home and the wonderful craft beer community in the States. Hill Farmstead is the real-deal and this porter shows that off quite well. Robust. Mature. And just really, really good. 849 charactersspdyfire83, Dec 08, 2011

Pours pitch black with a big rocky tan head that recedes very slowly and leaves great lacing.
Aroma is not as roasty as I was expecting with more sweet milk chocolate and malty sweetness. There is a light roasted black malts and coffee beans.
Taste mirrors the aroma with some smooth caramel malts and dark chocolate dominating up front. The backbone is roasty but not overly so. There is definitely some chocolate sweetness in the finish as well as a hint of smoke.
The mouthfeel is excellent and about as creamy as I've ever had in a porter. Solid carbonation.
This is one of the sweeter porters I've tasted recently and almost tastes like a smoky chocolate stout. Really good stuff. 704 charactersgford217, Dec 06, 2011

Pours an opaque mahogany brown with a light layering of tanned head. Spots of lacing left behind, wispy retention lays on top of the brew. 
Roasty, malty nose with coffee and espresso notes. Light char and smoke with some dark chocolate sweetness. Almost no alcohol presence, very inviting. 
Bold malty profile begins up front with roasted tones. Some nutty flavor with a nice layering of coffee and espresso beans. Dark chocolate lies underneath the malt backbone. Light smokiness comes through towards the back end with a touch of char. Finishes a little sweet and smoky. 
Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, robust and chewy on the palate. Excellent example of the porter - I wish I could have this all the time. 770 charactersxnicknj, Dec 05, 2011

Picked this up at Winooski Beverage on the way back from the Alchemist bottle release.
Poured from a 500ml. bottle.
Appearance: A reverse cascade effect that billows into a voluminous head. Foam is the color of dark milk chocolate. Body is an opaque brown. Only knock is not enough lacing. Simply gorgeous.
Smell: Cocoa, dark chocolate, espresso, some fruit (dried cranberries?). Strong and powerful.
Taste: A nice medley of milk chocolate (bordering on the dark) and coffee. Espresso with cream. Raw coffee grinds with roasted goodness. As it warms, flavors really open up.
Mouthfeel: Just the right mix of mild bitterness and strong malt. Really searches all the corners of the palate. As it warms, it almost feels like i'm eating rather than drinking it which proves that a beer can be chewy :)
Overall: I thin i found my favorite porter. Really easy to drink, a pleasure and top notch. Grab this if you can find it. 969 characterspapat444, Nov 29, 2011

4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5500 mL bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead longstem snifter. Purchased at Winooski Beverage Warehouse for $10. Beautiful muddy beige head a good lacing. This brew is straight black with good medium to full body.
Smells of roasted malts, dark chocolate, some earthy hops, port wine, maybe a little raisin or dark fruit too.
Tastes sublime: chocolate notes, subtle roastiness, molasses, coffee, raisins, mildly bitter hops.
Mouthfeel is silky smooth up front, with subtle bitterness in the aftertaste.
Overall one of the best - if not the best - porters I've ever had. This brewery is top notch - very happy I found this bottle (last one in the shop back in September). 671 charactersElGallo, Nov 23, 2011

4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Special Thanks to Mtardiff for this bottle. Sadly, it’s the last of my bottles from Hill Farmstead. Time to another trade or a trip to Vermont.
Wow, is this a standard Porter? Pours like an Imperial Stout. The head build from within and then appears to sit on top the beer like a coffee colored milk shake. Excellent retention. The beer is very dark brown with no light showing anywhere. Decent lacing.
Aroma is very nice. Molasses, black licorice and some dark roasted malt. A smoothness and rounded sweetness to the aroma. No harshness.
Initially a moment of coffee, then a touch of cocoa. Black licorice isn’t really present for me in the flavor like it was in the aroma. Black pepper notes along with the dark roasted notes. A touch of ash, but not with the grit that sometimes accompanies this. Some cinnamon every now and again.
Mouth feel is soft, rounded and smooth. Medium to robust in body but not nearly as thick as an Imp stout as mention in the first paragraph above.
Good Porter. Spot on for the style and I prefer the larger mouth feel of this version. 1,076 charactersReagan1984, Nov 20, 2011

A: Pours near black with a huge, dense, dark brown head that lasted forever and left patches of soapy lacing as it faded into a wispy scum. 
S: Robust notes of chocolate malt, roasted malts, smoke, burnt wood and a bit of something sweeter – caramel and raisins maybe. 
T: The chocolate really comes through along with notes of coffee, raisins, and toasted wood. The finish is lightly sweet and the aftertaste has a bit of a dark chocolate bitterness to it. Not as smoky as the nose, but it shows up in the finish as well. 
M: Very creamy mouthfeel with a drying finish. The body is rich and decadent, and the carbonation is smooth, soft and mellow. 
O: One of the best porters I’ve had. Loved the smoky notes that accompanied the dark chocolate, and the mouthfeel was crazy soft, rich, and smooth. Thanks again for the bottle, Patrick. 915 charactersscottfrie, Nov 19, 2011

Pours a slightly brown/ruddy black with a large light tan head.
Smells primarily of char and ash, with notes of coffee and a slightly bitter ... chocolate? Maybe something bitterer than that .. kind of an espresso cacao aroma. Smells good.
Taste is surprisingly more rounded than the aroma, with notes of dark fruit, a surprising amount of espresso/coffee, and a light, very very light, undercurrent of malty chocolate sweetness. Unfortunately, the ash/char/smoke continues to make its presence felt in a big way, and it gets a bit distracting.
I like it. Good, robust mouthfeel. 606 charactersOverlord, Nov 10, 2011

A - A finger's worth of rich thick densely packed menacing deep dark brown colored head... Solid retention, especially given the minimal head to start... Once fully receded you're left with a full rich creamy lacing... The color is an opaque flat black... Still with no discernible carbonation... 
S - A potent mix of chocolate and coffee... The chocolate notes are predominately milk chocolate with a bit of dark chocolate mixed in... Bits of fudge... The coffee lightly roasted but still assertive... Some faint roasted malt character... Some very mild woody notes as well... Some caramel and toffee sweetness... Excellent aroma... 
T - The palette displays a bit more predominance of roasted malt and coffee... The chocolate notes take a back seat but are still present... Mild caramel and toffee sweetness... A slightly charred finish... 
M - On the fuller side of medium bodied... Very lightly carbonation... Thick... Rich... Mildly creamy... A bit chalky on the finish... Consistent... Very nice...
D - A top tier slightly assertive American Porter... True to the style with out blurring any style guideline... Excels in all facets... Highly recommended... 1,222 charactersphilbe311, Nov 08, 2011

Thanks to jl28r1 for this bottle!
Anyone remember Carl Everett? Man, it seems like forever ago that the ChiSox won it all with that guy... Anyway, this stuff pours a rather dark black-brown topped by a healthy bit o' light sienna foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts, toasted biscuit, cocoa, and a touch of coffee. The taste follows pretty closely, with the roast coming in darker, more charred. and the coffee, though still subdued compared to the other elements, coming in a tad darker and more acrid. Everything melds nicely, though, with nothing taking any real stage time from anything else. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slightly dry finish. Overall, a very nice porter, nothing overtly extraordinary, but a tasty, enjoyable treat. 846 charactersTMoney2591, Nov 03, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750 mL growler purchased in early October and shared with GarrettMD a week later.
A - Black with brown edges. Half a finger of mocha head. Retention is average. Good lacing.
S - Licorice aroma with an English characteristic that I sometimes describe as being like copper or blood. Some cocoa makes an appearance as well. Nicely balanced.
T - Licorice, coffee, chocolate, and a huge roast character that later turns into a charred or smoky flavor. All the flavor of a nice big stout, but lighter and better balanced in the way a porter often can be. Cocoa beans and smoked malts.
M - Medium body with average carbonation. Beer remains wet throughout. Dull around the edges but there is a sort of sharpness to the feel.
O - Perhaps my favorite porter. At my tasting at the brewery we were each given the opportunity to double up on one of the tastings. Given the options including both James and Ephraim, I still went with Everett. It really goes to show that this beer is truly great in my mind. A huge hit from a wonderful brewery. 1,036 charactersgreenmonstah, Oct 30, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Perfectly black, no light gets through this beer anywhere. 1 finger of slightly darker than normal tan head. Fades to a ring around the outer rim quickly.
S - Licorice, anise, hints (and I mean very faint hints) of cherry, with a background of slight roasted malts that barely peek through the licorice. This beer really does smell almost exactly like a black licorice stick, so much so I almost want to say it has some sort of brett in it.
T - Licorice still dominates, but lesser so than in the aroma. Smoke is also present right along with it. Sweet sugars come through a lot more pairing well with the chocolate and toffee from the roasted malts. 
M - Medium body, lightly carbonated, thicker than a normal porter and quite sticky. Finish is slightly sticky, slightly drying, and very sweet with a licorice/chocolate lingering aftertaste.
O - One of the most interesting porters I have ever had. A lot of flavors and aromas not normally found in a porter as well as a body more likely to be found in a stout. 1,020 charactersGarrettMD, Oct 22, 2011

4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle from bring. Thanks, Barry.
Appearance: A ton of foam upon first pour, with a small amount of black liquid beneath. Swirling out some of the carbonation leaves me with an opaque dark brown beer topped by a frothy, lasting head. While it's excessively carbonated for the style, it's a great looking beer once the foam settles down.
Aroma: Cocoa, subtle smoke, licorice, coffee, roasted malt, roasted peanuts. Smells fantastic, wow. There's a lot going on here.
Palate: Nearly perfect for the style. Rich without a ton of sweetness, though it's plenty malty. Roasty, bready flavors roll across the tongue first, followed by smoke and licorice, coffee, roasted nuts. Medium-full body with a bitter, toasty finish that leaves a lingering note of anise. Fantastic. 768 characterslargadeer, Oct 21, 2011

S: Lots of roasted malts with creamy chocolate and robust coffee aromas. There are some vanilla notes in there as well along with just a hint of tart aromas.
T: Similar to the aroma, roasted malts dominate with creamy chocolate and robust coffee flavors. It's sweet at first but finishes with robust flavors that are only slightly bitter. Again, there are also faint notes of vanilla and tartness.
M: Medium-thick body with fairly lowish carbonation despite the great head retention, this beer is super silky and creamy.
O: Overall, I think I might have a new favorite porter. This beer is beautiful and delicious. My only real complaint is on the nose, which I wish were a bit more pronounced. Beyond that, it is great and I'd love to have regular access to this beer. 898 charactersn2185, Oct 19, 2011

Everett pours black into the glass with a small, light tan head on top. The foam dissolves quickly to a thin sheet on the surface leaving behind a few spots of lace on the glass.
The aroma is malty with notes of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. Hints of citrus and pine hops are also present.
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is smooth, silky and lightly carbonated. The flavor begins with chocolate, coffee and a touch of roast malt. In the middle a touch of nuts and piney hops move in. It finishes sweet and leaves a lingering chocolate flavor when gone.
This is a very drinkable, full flavored beer. Very tasty and well balanced. 731 charactersWanderingFool, Oct 17, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a deep, dark and chunky brown color with thin but dense cap of brown head, little rings of lacing towards the top. Scent leads with dark and milk chocolate before settling into a long note of roast with some char, the end has notes of fresh ground coffee and dark fruit. Taste follows suit without being too thin or venturing into stout territory. Full flavored on the palate, equal parts chocolate and roast with background notes of coffee and fruit, little hints of spice... very well layered as each presents themselves. Medium to full bodied, good carbonation levels, a little lingering char on the palate. One of the top American Porters that strikes the right balance without encroaching too far on stout territory like many full flavored porters do. 762 charactersrfgetz, Oct 11, 2011

At the time of this review, this is the #2 American Porter on the top style list and this beer is also on the Top Beers - Popular list at spot #70.
Beer is black / dark brown and hazy with a nice off white head of small tan bubbles, lacing, nice carbonation...
Aroma is mildly roasty, mildly alcohol, smells like a porter should, mildly sweet.
Beer is medium to light in body, pretty sweet on the lead off but the back palate is all porter all the time. Great little beer, wonderful how the alcohol is there without the beer being boozy, sweet, strong, drinkable...nice. 652 charactersdrabmuh, Oct 02, 2011

A 500ml bottle from my cellar and into a chalice. A huge frothy mocha head forms on the darkest SRM possible for a beer, a little darker then your typical porter.
A decent nose of roasty malt, chocolate, a slight lactose sweetness and cola. 
Awesome taste on this one, lots of depth and complexity. Layers of roasty coffee and dark chocolate, a touch smokey. The taste finishes with a slight sweetness and a light bitterness. The mouthfeel is big.
A great porter overall, this one really blurrs the line between a stout and a porter. It is not as roasty as some of the best stouts but it's close. What's impressive about this porter is the amount of coffee in the taste without a coffee infusion. Hill Farmstead brews up a dream in a bottle!!! 904 charactersalpineclimber, Sep 25, 2011

Aroma is rich chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, dark burt caramels, light fruitiness, subtle "C" hops. Very nice, I can honestly call it decadent.
Flavor follows the nose, very chocolatey, nice balance of roast, hints of dark fruits (figs). Midway through/towards the finish there is some alcohol, light roast, more chocolate (dark) and hints of hop bitterness. The finish is smooth and enjoyable with dark caramels and chocolate lingering.

4.36/5  rDev -2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Another bottle direct from the friendly home of RSchaeffer. My first non farmhouse, non hop focused beer from Hill Farmstead.
The simple labels are beginning to mean so much to me. 
Everett opens with a nice hiss and pours a steady head of tight bubbles. The carbonation is firm but not overly thick as it lasts and sticks quite nicely to the sides of the glass. Big aroma of dark coffee, some char, smoke and a bit of chalk that reminds me of limestone. Some bitterness from the hops is also present.
The first sip brings the same smokey and toasty flavors to light that were felt on the nose. Coffee, bitter chocolate, hops and a delicious bitterness holds throughout the semi-sweet body of the beer. Long on the tongue with favorable complexity that is easily enjoyed. This is a remarkable porter as it has more of the drying toasted grain flavors and bitter hopping but it all works upon the faint mineral notes. Very drinkable as the body doesn't weight down the palate with heft. 
One of the better porters I have had recently, truth be told, I'm a fan of bitter dark beers so I can see some not agreeing who like the sweeter more caramelized styles. Russian River's Porter is still perhaps the beer that I find to be my favorite representation of the style but Everett will be one I hope to drink many more times in the future. Truly delicious. 1,355 charactersBardwashrind, Sep 21, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a sniffer, thanks to texasclimber for sharing this one.
Appearance: Black with reddish hues when held to the light, topped off with a thin mocha colored head that fades into a thin lacing. 
Aroma: Roasted grain, chocolate and coffee.
Taste: Light chocolate flavor mixed with roasted grain, coffee, and even molasses. On the sweeter side of porters.
Mouthfeel: This is really, for me, the only reason it is not easily in the top 3 porters for me. It was a little thin then what I prefer, medium body with medium carbonation.
Overall: A great porter and on of the best I've had, I look forward to trying more of Hill Farmstead beers in the future. 662 charactersjamescain, Sep 15, 2011

Pours all black with a cm of tan head which dissipates to a thin ring, some lacing on the glass.
There is a very delicious smell with this beer, one of the best noses I have experienced. Notes of cocoa, roasted malts, coffee, cocoa, and some burnt/smoke.
The taste follows the nose closely, though the nose is stronger in my opinion. Flavors include smoke/charcoal, cocoa, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. I even think there was a little bit of pepper and hickory in the mix.
This beer has an incredibly thick and creamy texture, silky smooth, incredible. 
Overall this is a very good beer. I was lucky enough to get a few Hill Farmstead brews on a recent trip and so far they have stood up to their reputation. I will be making excuses to return in the near future. 828 charactersmmurphy525, Sep 12, 2011

4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the blackback tavern.
Dark pour, dark brown head with good lacing. Looks great right off the bat.
Smells like roasty malty goodness.... robust is definitely the right description for this porter. Very pleasing to the nose.
Tastes magical. Roasted Malts permeate the palate while keeping a balanced and not overpowering flavor, if that makes sense. Well balanced chocolate malt is all I can describe it as. 
Mouthfeel is good, well carbonated porter. Acidic and bitter zing.
This may be the best porter that I've ever had. In fact, I think it is. I don't really even like porters aside Baltic ones and this has completely made my taste for the genre flipturn upside down. Fresh prince style.
If you ever get the chance to try this, do so. 753 charactersAberration, Sep 02, 2011

A: Great looking beer, mostly black with hints of red and a substantial tan head. Very nice lacing.
S: A nice mix of sweet chocolate and roast malts. 
T: Wow, I'm speechless. This might be the best tasting porter I've ever had. Incredible balance here, it's sweet, but has an awesome roasty backbone and has hints of dark fruit hiding in there. 
M: Very carbonated, but also quite nicely medium-thick bodied. Perfect for the style.
O: Until I had this beer, I pretty much had sworn off American Porter as a style, but no more. Of course Hill Farmstead is the brewery that revived this style for me, and now I can't wait to have more.

Oh dear. This is the best American porter I've had in recent memory. Pours a near black with a large mocha head with impressive lacing and retention. Aroma is complex and subtle, a blend of chocolate, roast malt, coffee, dark fruit, mild bitterness, and smoke. Flavor is similar, with roast and smoke providing a strong backbone for the sweet chocolate and dark fruit. Medium thick, with soft full bodied and soft carbonation. Edmund used to be my favorite American Porter. Now Everrett is. 518 charactersyourefragile, Aug 30, 2011

Very nice thick lace down the sides, gooey and creamy, very nice look to it. Smell took a while to warm up, at first was strong alcohol and caramel sweetness. As it warmed some more subtle smells started to come through, hints at chocolate and coffee started to overtake, and the alcohol quickly faded, leaving a very nice overall aroma. The taste followed the smell with the caramel hitting first. Nice flavors of coffee followed, maybe even a hazelnut hint in there, well rounded. 622 charactersmikesgroove, Aug 20, 2011

Appearance: Super dark chestnut / mahogany to opaque black. The crown is 3 fingers, brown, shows loads of retention and good lace.
Smell: Medium roast malt, some dark chocolate, a dash of caramel, and a light charred backbone.
Taste: Same as nose. So well balanced.
Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation and a thick side of medium body.
Drinkability: Super drinkable thanks to nicely balanced flavors. I dig it more than the BA version myself. 507 characterskoopa, Aug 17, 2011
4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle from Baconsausage poured into my Portsmouth tulip. 
A very dark red, looks black until backlit. Huuuge gorgeous rocky tan head with intense and thick lacing. Amazing retention. 
This is THE BEST looking porter I've come across. 
Smells very move as well... Notes of caramel, toffee, coffee and bitter chocolate. The taste is also quite good-- some sweetness with lots of dark chocolate and coffee notes. 
Awesome milk-shake thickness feel on the body. Creamy and chewy. 
Overall, this is one of the best porters I've come across. For a style I don't like, this beer stands out as a delicious beverage I would be happy to drink again. 644 charactersAleWatcher, Aug 17, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Drank from a 750 ml swing top growler purchased at the Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro, VT
Served in a Hill Farmstead Brewery stemmed glass
Near obsidian in appearance with dark mahogany edges. A bubbly, one-finger head of mocha-colored froth topped the liquid. The head faded to a thick lasting ring. Spotty drops of lacing stuck along the glass.
The nose was flawless. Totally spot-on for the style. Rich roasted malts came through strong. Lots of semi-sweet chocolate and a decent amount of smoke. Some brown sugar as well. There was a nice balance between the sweetness and the dryness. The chocolate notes came out more as the beer warmed, and they turned sweeter and more cocoa powder-like. A good dosage of vanilla was noticeable as well.
The flavor profile was quite similar to the nose. Robust and moderately roasty up front. Bakers chocolate and French press coffee notes appeared in the center. Some cola as well. Charred malts came through on the finish. A touch ashy and quite dry. A bit of warmth from the alcohol was noticeable in the back of my throat. Crisp, piney hops lingered into the aftertaste.
The mouthfeel was respectable. Medium bodied for the style with a fine, moderate effervescence. Slick and smooth.
I was aware that Shaun is a master of brewing hoppy beers but I did not realize he could also do other styles so well. This is truly a fantastic rendition of an American porter. 1,416 charactersDamian, Jul 25, 2011

A - black with a monnster light mocha head.
S - in your face with the chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Not super complex but it packs a lot in the nose
T - super sweet with a nice roastiness to balance the sweetness. Thus is my style of beer.
M - not sure what to think here. Feels like I'm drinking carbonated chocolate milk, but for the beer it just works. Don't think I've ever had this much body in a beer without oats and higher Abv.
O - one of the best porters I've had. So much aroma and flavor in this beer without a killer alcohol level. This is definitely a beer I'd love to have again. 622 charactersChrisPro, Jul 24, 2011

A near black with a little cola at the edge, nice dark tan head falls to a thin film leaving a few specks of lace
S a little smokey with a chocolate blast, very big chocolate nose, smells like something I want to eat 
T even better then the smell, somehow there's even more chocolate and a blast of coco powder, with some slight coffee and it reminds me of chocolate covered raisins, pretty rich and I wouldn't change anything
M thick liquid and bubbles cream it up a fair bit, quite rich and there's zero booze detected, what impresses me the most is the length of time the flavors sticks to your mouth, toothpick anyone?
O this is one of the better examples of the style, robust is an understatement, this is a wicked brew without doubt,

Pure liquid chocolate, mellow char, dark chocolate aroma.
Deep roast, mocha and espresso notes, dark chocolate composing the core flavors of this porter. Creamy with a dry aftertaste. Mellow and moderately bitter towards the end. Relatively dry, mellow feel. Pleasantly rich dark chocolate flavors, tasty stuff, but not all that different from local favorites. Thank you Dave for sharing! 602 charactersemerge077, Jul 18, 2011

Pours motor oil black into my tulip glass, no light penetrates. Small tan infused head settles quickly, but leaves speckles as you go. Nose is roasty and sweet smelling. Dark chocolate and oak. Sweet malt up front with bitter chocolate. Molasses & coffee linger on the palate. Dark dried fruit. Vanilla and bourbon notes. Subtly smoky, with a super dry finish. A crisp carbonation stings your mouth, and the medium creamy body makes this super drinkable. As it warms some cherry cola and tobacco flavors come out. Agitating leaves a beautiful faint wispy head swirl. Rich but not over indulgent. Gets better and better as it warms.
Absolutely Delicious. 759 charactersggilman, Jul 18, 2011

Aroma is dominated by deep and immersive wood char with cola caramel and licorice. Taste is more wood char, ash, mocha, and the black cookie part of an Oreo cookie. Light and delicate yet robust and flavorful. Beautifully roasty. 411 charactersdonkeyrunner, Jul 17, 2011

Review from notes scrawled on my phone while politely listening to an old local guy talk about his old beat-up girlfriend in demeaning fashion and politely smiling while she encouraged it by talking about how she danced on top of the bar last time she was there. It's a tiny bar. And the guy asked me if I wanted to fight him when he saw me typing on my phone. Awkward.
In fact, remembering that experience, I have to say that it was both one of the weirdest and best bar experiences I've had. Cool bartender, great taps, low key vibe, and two extremely strange locals that will never read this review.
And since it IS a review... Everett Robust Porter from Hill Farmstead is a high example of the style that everyone should try. The deep brown pour reveals a big tan head that leaves only a little lacing after it dissipates, but still produces a brilliant smell. Roasted but not burnt coffee, chocolate, and a distinct nuttiness as well come into my nose. 
The guy beside me gives me a funny look "Wanna take my girlfriend home with you? Wanna trade girlfriends?"... I eye my girlfriend protectively and sip. Pow - bitter coffee, sweet roasty coffee, grains, touch of nuts, everything a porter should be come through in the first sip all the way to the last. No hint of alcohol, only a trace of hops, but still Everett has a totally clean finish. "No thanks."
"What? She's not hot?"
Awkward laugh. "She seems totally suited to you, my man."
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"Nothing man, it's all good. Cheers!" I lift Everett up, ching ching glasses, and finish the thick bodied porter with a smile. 1,719 charactersafksports, Jul 16, 2011

Pours a dark brown bordering on black with a tight tan head that sticks around for a while. Smells of roasted grains, coffee and chocolate, licorice and a hint of alcohol. Taste is smooth dark chocolate mixed with coffee and anise with hints of alcohol molasses and dark dried fruits. Velvety smooth creamy mouthfeel, moderate level of carbonation, medium to thick body. This is a fantastic porter! I just wish it were a little easier to come by. 488 charactersjohnnnniee, Jul 14, 2011

A: A hard pour down the middle leads to a little of a finger of dark mocha brown head with a lot of bubbly action (looks a lot like the surface of a macchiato. Pitch black. Leaves a little lacing. 
S: Very heavy roasted grains with a little char, dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, dark caramel (nearly burnt), a little wood (don't think it's actually aged in/on wood though). Dark, strong, and a little sweet. 
T: Follows the nose quite well with the most striking difference is that it isn't nearly as sweet as it smells. Extremely balanced, heavy roasted malt with a ton of grain, dark chocolate, and Earthy, medium roasted coffee, with just a little dark caramel sweetness. There isn't really any variation or progression of flavors, it's all completely incorporated and stays the same from start through the middle. The finish does become bitter and dry with a dry oak quality (dry bitter char wood finish). Very creamy and smooth. Alcohol is barely detectable, a feat for an 8% beer. 
M: Close to a full body with oderate to slightly high carbonation with very fine bubbles. Very smooth and creamy, it's like velvet even with the dry and bitter finish. 
O: A fantastic Robust Porter, about as close to the ideal as it gets. Big, roasty with lots of depth and complexity, smooth, creamy, drinkable, and above all else, enjoyable. 1,439 charactersSatchboogie, Jul 13, 2011

A - Voluminous tan foam settles to a thin cap, leaving behind splotchy lace. Black body that is surprisingly dark for a porter, with only the faintest glint of brown near the edges.
S - Earthy grains, roasted barley, light molasses and brown sugar, and notes of coffee and chocolate as it warms up.
T - Taste is nearly identical to the aroma. It's roasty, but with a sufficient amount of balancing sweetness to get things from getting to bitter. Just a delightful and balanced robust porter.
M - Creamy, medium-full body, with pleasant moderate carbonation, some slight roasty dryness, and no obvious alcohol.
D - It's a reference quality robust porter. The only thing that would prevent me from consuming mass quantities is the mounting roast bitterness in the finish. Otherwise, a superb brew that I think surpasses the barrel-aged version. Who the heck said this was too thin?! 946 charactersMasterSki, Jul 11, 2011

The smell is roasty, chocolate, light buttery, syrupy light molasses or maple not sure which. The taste is thick, rich, oaky, leathery, and smoky. Great porter. Great mouthfeel and carbonation. This and Captain Lawrence porters are top of this class. I've had this in bottle and growler a few times and it never fails to impress. If you like porters, this is a must have and even better readily available. 520 charactersspycow, Jul 10, 2011

Price - $15.00/ growler
Appearance is pitch black with a beautiful two inch creamy brown foam head, wow. After several minutes the head settles down to a thin layer covering the liquid goodness. Big time thick lacing decorates the drinking vessel to show itself off as an exceptional example of the style. A quick swirl of the glass and a blanket of creamy brown foam reappears.
The aroma is a right hook to the jaw with dark chocolate followed by coffee, roasted malt, nuts and caramel. 
The flavor is right up my alley with a strong taste of chocolate, mocha, licorice, vanilla and a smoke finish that's near perfect. 
Starts off creamy soft and silky smooth with a full body, I really dig this beer. At room temperature the mouthfeel is near perfect. Hoppy and bitter in the middle followed by a semi dry sticky finish. Outstanding balance between the malts and hops.
Damn, I can't get enough of Shaun's beers and this is another favorite of mine. Added to the website as another stellar example of the style. 1,079 characters05Harley, Jul 05, 2011

A - Deep coffee brown body with almost three fingers of creamy mocha-colored foam on top that receded to a thick webbing of intricate lacing. 
S - Rich cocoa and roasted coffee notes in the nose, as well as a hint of smoke and peat. There is also a faint earthy hop presence.
T - Like the aroma, chocolate and coffee dominate the initial flavor. However, the porter quickly moves into more bitter territory, offering an earthy hop bite as well as some smokey notes reminiscent of firewood. Everett is quite bitter in the backend, which pairs nicely with the earthy, roasty attributes, giving the finish a hint of astringency. 
M - Medium bodied with mild carbonation and a smooth, creamy texture. Finishes with a hint of smokey astringency and earthy bitterness on the palate.
D - Tasty, complex Porter with smokey, roasty and chocolatey characteristics, giving the brew tons of depth and minimal sweetness. 982 charactersffejherb, Jun 27, 2011

Pours dark brown, pretty much a notch on the color wheel away from black with two fingers of creamy mocha colored head. Really nice retention and sticky lace. Probably one of the best looking beers I've seen. 
A little bit smokey on the aroma with bitter dark chocolate aromas. Wheat toast in the background with a little bit or dark roast coffee in the aroma. Dark bitter bakers chocolate on the aroma with a nice char flavor to round it out. A little bit of dark roast coffee to finish this one up.
For a robust porer the body seems a bit on the light side, but real nice soft carbonation. Overall this one is simply rock solid. Another well done effort from the Vermont crew. I will always look forward to any of their beers. 812 charactersBendurgin, Jun 27, 2011

The taste starts out with sweet malt followed by a clean bitter roasted finish. There is a gentle hop flavor in the finish. Nothing too fancy here, but I have to be impressed by the perfect sweet and bitter balance.
The mouthfeel is robust and the carbonation just enough to make this refreshing.

Deep roasted malt aroma with a good balance of silky chocolate.  Subtle lactic cream along with hints of roasted espresso/coffee, chicory, oatmeal, nut and toffee.  Very nice roast character without smelling acrid or burnt.  Lots of coffee character without overpowering the chocolate notes
Medium bodied with a nice balance of roasted malt an sweet silky chocolate notes.  Bittersweet chocolate, coffee/espresso, oatmeL hazelnut and toffee.

Pours an ink black with a two finger, thick, dark khaki cap. Cap rose quickly and settled in raindrop fashion. Excellent retention with dots and sheets of lace everywhere.
The nose on this beast is of deep roast, bakers chocolate, dark cherries, light citrus and a faint touch of ethanol. Everything is big and robust.
The flavor profile explodes on the palate. Deep, delicate roast and bitter dark chocolate take over initially, then dark cherries and light citrus before the roast/chocolate comes back in the finish. Just a faint warming from this guy.
Near perfect. Full body with maybe a touch too much carbonation to make this lush and velvety. Still, very smooth and soft on the palate.
This is definitely the best porter I have ever had. I knew that on the first sip. I so didn't want to buy into the hype, but this beer has it going on. This is an exceptional porter. 915 charactersColForbinBC, Jun 19, 2011

Bottle courtesy of bring, thanks! Poured into a snifter.
A: The dark brown color borders on black, with an enormous brown head that remains for over five minutes. A beer of this style cannot improve in appearance. Lacing completely coated the glass as the head slowly receded.
S: Dark chocolate and an upper moderate level of roast with some char. Upper low sweetness. Earthy hops. Dash of caramel accompanies a bready and grainy quality. Whisper of coffee and very faint dark fruit presence.
T: Moderate roastiness with a lower moderate level of sweetness. The chocolate profile resembles dark chocolate with a little caramel, toffee, and nuttiness. Coffee flavor is at an upper low level and there's a dash of biscuit. Bitterness is at an upper low level and the hop profile is earthy and restrained. Alcohol flavor is very faint. The finish is dry, with chocolate and roast.
M: Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is silky, creamy, and sticky. Fantastic.
Overall: An exceptional Robust Porter. Highly recommended. 1,048 charactersHopHead84, Jun 16, 2011

4.5 A: Black color. First pour yielded over a hand of head, but I got a full glass on my second pour. Three fingers of super creamy/pillowy light brown head with excellent retention and tons of ungodly thick lacing. This would have easily been a perfect score if I only needed one pour to achieve this.
4.0 S: Coffee and chocolate are the main attraction here with smoke and dark crystal malts not far behind. Good amount of roastiness as well, which strikes a good balance between the sweet maltiness. This smells very nice as is, but would be amazing if all the aromas were amplified a bit.
4.5 T: This is really tasty. Again, there's lots of coffee and chocolate. A peaty twang is there along with smoke. A healthy bit of caramel sweetness gives this robust porter the robustness. Lots of sweet maltiness overall, which is again balanced nicely by the roastiness. The taste is a lot like the nose, just more powerful.
5.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Super creamy, especially for the ABV. Can't get much better than this.
4.5 D: This is a very good beer. It's quite robust overall, but no flavor is out of place or too strong. Really great beer that didn't need to be more than 7.5% to be delicious. 1,255 charactersDavoleBomb, Jun 07, 2011

Everett (never name your kids this) came to me looking porterish with a dark shoe shine polish brown look with blackness creeping in. A nice whisp of head up top with slotz of lace here and there. Smell is malt ridden with some smoke and coffee beans underlined with some dark fruit and peat. Taste is a robust porter, this one screams malts and shows em off to. Roasty malt, Smoky malt and probably some others. The coffee comes through and some cocco powder and even a little vanilla under all of that. This is what a porter should be, no bells and whistles. Feel was stepping up from medium and it was just dank, I cant explain it any other way. I coulda drank a shit ton of this. 716 charactersBARFLYB, Jun 04, 2011

A- comes over with little to no head just a few bubbles at the edges atop a almost pitch black body. 
S- robust is right. Lots of bordering on burnt roasted malts with a deep smokey sweetness. Dark dried fruits and a rich bready hit. 
T- this is all about the malts. Layer upon layer of deep roasted malts giving you dark chocolate and some espresso, with a molasses and burnt brown sugar sweetness. Lots of dried dark fruits again with some blackberries as well. Hints of smoke and char but not over the top. 
M- a few steps above medium in body and lightly carbed, just enough fizz to keep things moving and light enough so it never gets to fluffy. 
O- great porter and a stand out in its depth. I keep saying this about Shauns beers but I stand buy it, they are some amazing brews and as easy to drink as they are fun to dissect into their many pieces. 880 charactersoglmcdgl, Jun 04, 2011

Pours black with a half-finger light brown head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells of heavy roasted malts with large amounts of dark chocolate. Also present are light espresso coffee bean and crisp earthy hop aromas.
Tastes very similar to how it smells. Robust roasted malt flavors kick things off and are tempered quickly by good amounts of smooth dark chocolate. Midway through the sip the roasted flavors subside further with the addition of earthy hops. Very slight amounts of smoke come into play near the end of the sip before fading out into a moderately bitter ending.
Mouthfeel is good. It’s got a nice thickness with solid carbonation.
Drinkability is great. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall this beer reminded me of Cadillac Mountain Stout with a hint of smokiness – no bells or whistles but nearly flawless. Well worth a shot. 965 charactersglid02, Jun 01, 2011

Wow, intense smell. Fresh espresso beans right out of the bag, caramel, some roasted malt and hints of dark fruit.
Taste somehow beats the awesome nose, this stuff is excellent. Coffee, vanilla, roasted malt and milk chocolate all balanced to perfection. I don't know how they got some of the flavors without actually adding coffee, but damn this is one tasty beverage.
Silky smooth mouthfeel, perfect balance, no alcohol at 7.5%. This drinks like an iced coffee concoction without being overly sweet.
A damn fine way to end the fest for me, this was my favorite of the beers I tried with an honorable mention to the Edward Pale Ale. I'd love to try this again from the bottle. 813 charactersChico1985, May 29, 2011

A: The body is a very dark brown with just the faintest edge translucence. Even a mild pour produces two fingers of tan head with excellent retention and lace left in its wake. 
S: Roasted coffee -- done in that perfect way that brings out beans and smoke without char and vegetables. It's so prevalent that I find myself scanning the bottle to see if this, like Earl, is made with coffee. It is not. Whatever grain selection or yeast went to work here, it did its job right. Milk chocolate (a mild lactic sweetness), smoke, and dark fruit are also evident. 
T: As in the nose, this beer is quite coffee-forward, though I'm aware at this point that the flavor is an effect of grain and yeast doing their work. I'm extremely impressed by its nuances of smoke, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. A lightly spicy bite in the finish complements the resurgent smoke flavor. Wow. 
M: 7.5% ABV isn't a heavyweight for my tasting group, but it's certainly a bit bigger than your usual beer. Yet Everett shows no trace of alcohol, perhaps due to the slightly fuller-than-medium body it boasts. It's not completely smooth; the peppery bite in the finish gives it a mild harshness that is unusual for a porter. I'm torn, because the pepper adds so much to the flavor, yet it detracts from the mouthfeel. I don't care. I'm rounding up. 
O: I simply could not stop sipping this. Rarely do I encounter a beer I could not put down. This is one. Seek this out. It's a gold standard for the style. 1,516 charactersArbitrator, May 17, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Opened on May 4, 2011. I have previously had the barrel-aged version, which was really nice, so I was looking forward to this. Thanks to RSchaeffer for the extra!
Pours black with two full fingers of thick tan head. Shaun knows his aesthetics. Ridiculous lacing. The only complaint is that the second pour yields almost too much head (four full fingers).
Smoky roast coffee, tons of milk chocolate, dark fruit and a nice milky creaminess. Toffee sweetness alongside a really pleasant spiciness. The sweeter and milky parts remind me of Velvet Merkin, but this features much more spicy balancing complexity and "robust," smoky elements.
Both milk and [xx%] cocoa dark chocolate, espresso roast coffee beans, peppercorn, and an ashy smokiness. The spicy oak found in the -bal version is here too. How? - I have no idea. More or less maps onto the nose.
At first, this has too much carbonation - medium-bodied, with full, expanding-in-the-mouth carbonation. Thirty minutes later, the creaminess characteristic of HFS comes through, and the body feels appropriately fuller.
Different, but pleasantly so. It's almost exactly what I expected - spicy, somewhat smoky, rich, quietly oaky, with coffee and chocolate. A winner.

4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Tcassel1 for hookin this one up. Growler poured into my CCB tulip.
A: Pretty much black, just slight highlighted edges. The pour dropped a great two finger head that faded to a thin rim, but left very little lace.
A: Huge chocolate, it really just overpowers the brew, but not in a bad way. I get notes of roast and earth as well. 
T: Chocoalte, roasted malt, small coffee, earth, and a very small hop presence. This is a very chocolate forward brew which I love. I am assuming this one is around 7 or 8%, and the alcohol is practically unnoticable. It finishes creamy and smooth.
M: As good as any beer can be. Creamy, carbonation is spot on. Heavy body, really just perfect.
O: As far as porters go, I don't think I have had a better one. The mouthfeel is perfect, and the taste is out of this world. Hill Farmstead is brewing some world class beer. Get it if you can. Skal. 895 charactersGtreid, Apr 29, 2011
3.76/5  rDev -15.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5From notes: Poured from a growler brought back to "the city" by a friend. 
A small but thick head forms. Beer is super dark and a swirl around the glass reveals a very viscous beer. It clings leaving a dark golden slickness almost like molases. As viscous as a beer twice its ABV. One of the most visualy beautiful beers I've seen. 
Smell is roasted malt, a little plumb, other dark fruits. Just a whiff of alcohol. 
Taste is big bold roasted malt and molasses up front that fades quickly revealing a sweet finish. Further sips bring out the sweetness. 
Thick, medium carbonation, slick. 
Overall this beer tastes great up front but suffers from the overly sweet finish. I understand that there is supposed to be a bit of that in a porter but it goes too far. Almost milk stout like. Could use a touch more hops to even things up. 835 charactersCascade77, Mar 24, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Having this fresh on my palette and fresh in my mind from a taste (thanks capra!!!!)...these notes are from memory from about 20 minutes ago.
Beer poured a shiny watery black with not much head...several glasses were poured and some had nicer tops...but didn't seem like much of anything visually. The smell was roasty and malty and even a bit smokey. Burnt matches was suggested. Taste was more of the same. I found it mostly to be like a roasty, somewhat smokey, milk stout. The porter characteristics were there, but there was a subtle creaminess and milkyness to the beer, but in a good way. Solid beer. Very unexpected, but SUPER glad I got to try it (seriously, thanks a ton for the share! turned a good night into a great night).
--- EDIT ---
had another encounter on 10/21 - thanks baconsausage!!!
an aggressive pour gave a nice chocolate milk colored head that vanished quick. the smell is super smokey, like a campfire. flavor was more of the same. definitely more of a smokey milk stout to me...the charred characteristics that i normally associate with a good porter are there, but much more in the backseat to the smokey chocolate milk. still an easy drinker and silky smooth. be forewarned if you aren't a fan of the smoke though. i generally agree with my scores from round one. 1,295 characterscosmicevan, Mar 10, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Brewery filled 2 liter "genie" shaped swing-top growler into a couple of tulip glasses.
Pours a dense black in the glass, topped with 2 thick fingers of milk chocolate colored head. The retention of this is strong, sticking around with a stiff creamy finger width that soaks the sides of the glass with rich spotty lacing. Wow, the aroma alone earns this beer its name, with a ROBUST mix of coffee, smoky roast, cocoa, toffee, fresh citrus, and a leafy spiciness. This literally just blows up in the nose with flavor. Awesome. 
The taste follows right along with the lead taken by the aroma, drenching the palate with a rich tangy mix of roasted coffee, chocolate malts, sticky caramel, and zesty citrus flavors, while hops and roast add a bitter bite to the proceedings. I think that the sticky dark sweetness mostly wins out here in the end, being well balanced and leaving a favorable lasting impression. The finish here is dry, with lingering notes of bitter fruit, sweet sugars, and burnt roast. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied, with a BIG feeling crisp creaminess that expands out into the mouth after each sip but then gets much more slick and creamy as this works its way towards the back of the throat. That slicker feel really highlights all of that delicious sweetness in the profile and couples with a zero alcohol presence to really keep this easy and silky feeling despite the extreme richness of the flavors. 
This was a VERY impressive American Porter and is definitely in my top 2-3 for the style. It's a robust, complex, easy drinking, and just a flat out flavorful Hill Farmstead offering that kept me completely satisfied until I drained the last drop from my glass. This is yet another in a long line of well executed and kick ass beers from Shaun and company. Well done! 1,794 charactersKegatron, Mar 02, 2011
4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Received this growler from baconsausage in the recent Regional Growler GIF. Thanks again!
A - Pours a very dark brown, almost black into the glass with a thin tan head and a light amount of lacing.
S - Roasted malt with light coffee and light hops. A little smokiness and chocolate in the nose as well.
T - As expected based on the nose. Up front I get the smokiness / oak, which then turns to dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and hops. 
M - Very nice on the palate. Perfectly balanced, just how I like my porters. The carbonation is quite good for a growler fill.
D - This was my first Hill Farmstead beer and they've already made me into a big fan. This porter is nicely balanced and yet very complex. Extremely smooth and highly drinkable. Looking forward to trying more from this brewery. 801 charactersJefe73, Mar 01, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Jason for sharing this growler.
A - Almost black beer with some ruby on the edges. Tan head that fades to a partial cap with some spots on the sides.
S - Smoke, wood, burnt cocoa, roasted malts, little bit of an earthy/peaty hop quality to it as well as a peatyness to the smoke. Very nice, a lot going on, and it's all good.
T - Don't really know how to improve on this. Coffee, roasted malts, burnt cocoa, great touch of smoke, oak, some dark fruit. Really has it all, and in all the right amounts. This is fantastic.
M - Nice carbonation on a full bodied beer.
D - Goes down easy, can really drink a lot of this, highly recommended. 650 charactersAgentZero, Mar 01, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Growler shared by Bobby. Thanks.
A: The pour is a very dark brown with some definite red notes when held to the light. A thin layer of tan foam.
S: There's a slight smoke to the aroma as well as some peat. Roasted malts, dark and bitter chocolate, and quite a bit coffee. There are some sort of surprising dark fruits, but a lot of licorice.
T: A lot of coffee and roasted malt flavor with some bitter dark chocolate. It's sort of bitter and astringent, however, with some definite ash and char. There's a good bit of smoke notes to it. Also, a lot of oak/wood flavor to this, which was sort of surprising.
M: Medium in body with a smooth and full carbonation.
D: A bit too ashy to be super drinkable, but still a solid beer. Glad to have tried this. 755 characterswomencantsail, Feb 21, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Growler poured into my Hill Farmstead glass... Pours a dark brown, almost black with a nice medium tan head. Good carbonation, retention is nice, no lacing... Aroma is outstanding, the epitome of what a porter should smell like, perfect coffee, a hint of alcohol, and dark fruits, simply perfect... The taste is equally perfect. Only thing that I wish it had was smoke to come to close to the Captain Lawrence Imperial Smoked porter. Roasted coffee with hints of chocolate, a slightly bitter finish. Did I say perfect? 518 charactersjrallen34, Feb 13, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Jason for the growler. Poured into Bruery tulip. 
A - Pours black, huge mocha-colored head, thick bubbly cap, nice thick lacing. Really, a beautiful-looking beer. 
S - Dark chocolate, slight smoke, oak/woody, nice hoppy notes. 
T - Very similar to the nose, but even better. Nice bitter dark chocolate, molasses, creamy sweetness. Hard to express how delicious this one is. 
M - Medium, rich and smooth, creamy finish. 
D - This beer doesnt try to be anything but a phenomenal porter. Very straight forward and right on the spot. If you're reading this Shaun, great job on this one. A must-try. 609 charactersSean9689, Feb 13, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a growler on multiple occasions. Deep, rich brown/black in color with tan head that laces nicely. Finish is slightly malty and roasty. My favorite of all the HFB offerings. Its balance of subtle coffee, chocolate and roastiness makes for an amazing experience. 272 charactersGatheringBrews, Jan 06, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Picked this up on my visit yesterday. I enjoyed a small sample of it and it's starting to cool down and soon, fall will be here. Perfect kind of beer for that.
Pours a pitch-black color with a thick, frothy brown head into my tulip. Excellent presentation for the style.
The aroma? Hints of rich, creamy coffee stand out at the front followed by a subtle hint of chocolate. Robust in aroma and looks thus far.
The taste is full of creamy coffee followed by dark fruit and a slight, slight hint of chocolate. In addition, there's a slight amount of hops. 
Mouthfeel can only be described as full of lingering creaminess. Carbonation is just right as there's no "harshness" on the throat. 
A marvelous local example of the style. I don't drink as many porters as I used to but if this becomes available on tap, I expect it to become a staple of my palate in the colder months. 889 charactersBrad007, Aug 16, 2010
