Smell is maple chocolate and coffee. Mouth feel is velvet, soft and sticky, low carbonation. Taste is perfect: burnt espresso, chocolate, hints of maple and maltiness. Maddeningly good. 323 charactersJshbrown40, Sep 14, 2016

4.94/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Easily one of the best beers I've ever had.  Really opened my eyes up as to what one of the best beers in the world would taste and the quality of it.
Black body with a mocha head pours like motor oil.  The smells are the best part of this as it really does smell like chocolate chip pancakes with syrup.  Brings me back as to when I was a kid.  The taste is chocolate, coffee, and maple syrup and the feel is a thick, mouth coating whole milk type.  Overall is this the best beer I've ever had?  Really depends on the mood I'm in but between this and other TH offerings like Very Hazy, KingJJJ, etc., I honestly can't decide.
If you are lucky enough to trade, buy, find this FRESH ... do so at any cost. 706 charactersBEEPOP, Aug 04, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pitch black color, with a thin bubbly, light brown colored head. The initial pour consisted of a lot of green peppers aromas. After letting it sit and breathe for a few minutes, the green pepper lessened and more dark roasted coffee and and nice maple syrup aroma started to come out, as well as a decent chocolate malt background. The flavor didn’t have any green pepper to speak of, but was definitely maple forward, which followed through into some nice mocha notes. A really nice fresh roasted coffee bean flavor and a fudgey finish. The body was a tad thin, though it had a creamy consistency to give the beer a “coffee with creamer’ impression. Overall, a great beer with a couple minor flaws. Coffee Stouts (with/without maple syrup) in general are some of my favorite beers. Would I put this one ahead of some of my favorites? Definitely not, but I could certainly see putting it in my top 10 of beers of this style, and I wouldn’t hesitate to drink it again. 983 charactersSoneast, Jan 30, 2016

A - Jet black in the glass with a thick, fingers worth of khaki head.  Looks awesome in the glass.  
N - Intense coffee, chocolate, fudge, sweet maple syrup.  Fresh coffee grounds, jamocha almond fudge ice cream.
T - massive maple syrup (which isnt crazy on the nose), coffee, rich, dark chocolate, roasted malts.  Its breakfast in a glass.  Medium full mouthfeel, thick, mouth coating.  Coffee bitterness sits on your tongue, finishes with an awesome maple syrup sweetness.
O - this is about as good as non BA stouts gets.  Is it the best beer in the world?  Who knows?  If you're lucky enough to experience this, you can make that call :) 693 charactersjow_42, Dec 30, 2015
4.94/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had a growler of this, about 2 days after picking it up. Tough to wait that long, but I shared it with a friend so that makes it worth it, right? Poured it into my Treehouse Tulip, which unlocks a new flavor profile. 
A - Pours a really nice dark brown with the a nice sized mocha head. It's so beautiful I could put a picture of it at my desk. 
S - The first smell I noticed was a strong maple spell at the beginning, followed by a light chocolate smell. I didn't get it at first, but after a few drinks a light coffee smell became more evident. It gives a pleasant balance that adequately represents the complexity of the drink. 
T - Maple Syrup comes out pretty strong, but it a good way and it was very sweet. The chocolate was rich, but not overpowering. Personally I would have loved a bit more of a coffee taste to it, but that is mostly my own preference. GM was very balanced, no one flavor was over powering, it was sweet but not too sweet. Rich, but not too rich. They hit a lot of the right buttons without going too far in any one of them. 
M- Has a nice mouthfeel to it, very thick and creamy without being so exhausting. It was enjoyable to drink the entire way through. This is a wonderful morning beer, and went well with brinner. 
O - Overall, this is my favorite beer out of Treehouse that I have had. I look forward to the chance to try this again and share it with more of my friends. Or to see what tweaks they may make next time around. 1,464 charactersCwaks, Dec 30, 2015

Taste: Very nice, I've had better. Bitter chocolate, spice.

Overall - Is this a good beer? Yes. Is this a great beer? Yes. Is this the best beer in the world? No.
Morning Delight is the better of the two when poured side by side. Hell, most Double Shots are better. 
I recommend trying this but I don't recommend going to great measures to do so.. 
Look - Jet black.
Nose - Amazing! Great coffee nose!
Taste - Coffee, chocolate, very good.
Mouthfeel - Sticky. Low carbonation. Medium to full body. Slight bit thinner than I was hoping for.

To say my expectations were high was an understatement.  Thankfully this beer lived up to it.  Pours jet black with very little head.  The aroma of coffee and maple draw you in.  The first sip your hit with delicate coffee and it finishes with maple and a hint of dark chocolate.  All around excellent beer.  My only complaint is it begs to be consumed with breakfast.  Reminds  me of a really good traditional Irish Coffee. 523 charactersNicole15, Dec 11, 2015

Poured into TH teku; jet black in color with minimal head. The aroma is big with lots of coffee and maple. The initial taste just blew me away; now I know why this is the #1 beer right now! You get the initial coffee which finishes which the rich maple and some chocolate. There is minimal heat too. The body is medium; not too light and not too thick. Overall this will definitely blow your socks off; just the perfect beer. Get your hands on some if you haven't already! The hype over this one is totally real. I even shared a little with my brother and his initial reaction was "WOW!" This has become my #1 beer in 2015 for sure. Cheers! 716 characterstregan_20, Dec 10, 2015

To be blunt this beer does it for me. The balance is perfect. Having had a few maple beers (CBS, Maple Triple) this incorporates the flavor without being overly pungent. There is no cloying sweetness that is rampant with other BA or maple stouts. Just all around TH nailed it on this one. If you can ever get some make the trip. I bought one to try and one to trade out but ended up keeping the second for tonight to enjoy watching the Big10 Champ!! 544 charactersMS22, Dec 05, 2015

O: Exceptional. Grab a hold of a growler and never let go. For me, it lived up to the hype and then some - even the wine-only snobs at our dinner party loved this beer and they hate beer. If everyone drank this beer for breakfast, world peace could be achieved in less time than it takes to make toast. Really my only gripe about Good Morning is that it's effectively ruined every other stout I'm bound to drink in the next month. The CBS I drank on Tuesday is a long lost memory...

Still had plenty of head when poured into tasting snifter.  Smell had maple and taste was sticky but didn't blow me away with maple taste.  Very solid Imp. Stout...not sure if the leak had any adverse effect on the taste. 337 charactersosc1123, Dec 01, 2015

Inch and a half dark brown creamy head.
Smells of coffee, cocoa, maple syrup.
At first sip, I got more sweet cocoa than anything else, then coffee and then delicious maple.  After a couple of sips the smell was more maple than anything.  It reminds me of having a Maple Frosted donut and coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  I see why this is so limited, absolutely amazing.
Best stout Ive ever had.
Creamy in mouthfeel even now, after half the pint is done.
Well worth the 3+ hour wait in line. 528 characterskalosjakar, Nov 24, 2015

Smells of rich chocolate and coffee, light booziness.  Not smelling much in the realm of maple.  Taste is a wave of coffee, cocoa.. bitter dark chocolate, but creamy.  Then comes a wave of the syrup.  This is the flavor of real maple syrup.  Really stands out the more you drink, but it's not overpowering.  As a mostly-novice stout drinker this is phenomenal.  Certainly stands as the best stout I've ever had, which is a reflection on the fact that it's approachable to anyone.  This is a legendary beer. 574 charactersanteatr23, Nov 23, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5By far one of my personal favorite beers ever.Great smell to it when you first pop open that top. The aroma of the beer when you pour it really oozes right out of the glass and into your nose. Once you lift that glass for your first sip I hope you are ready for your mind to be blown. You get this nice thick syrup of a beer in your mouth from the first sip to the last. I have had dreams of getting to the bottom of the container after it is poured and rubbing my face and some pancakes around in the residue that is left over. If only I could that someday. I must  though this beer drinks very nice for a stout, heavy but not overbearing, light but not too light. I recommend a nice big tulip glass to let all of the flavors and aromas to develop before placing this delicious syrup in your mouth. 799 charactersjack89, Nov 19, 2015

It reminds me of peaty Islay single malt in terms of its potency packed with flavors. Almost need to drink this on a snifter because the nose is quite complex. Leave your emptied glass and come back an hour later to find the room filled with coffee aroma. Just an awesome brew that's perfect for this time of the year. Flavors really pop as you warm it up a bit. I took points off because it's moderately more carbonated than what I expected but otherwise well-deserving of the hype. 540 charactersallezvousen, Nov 18, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a 750ml growler into a TH teku:
Appearance: the perfect imperial stout. Pours deep, dark brown, bordering on black, with a huuuuuuuge, long-lasting head. Mocha colors the edges when you swirl the beer, and the head is a rich tan color. 
Aroma: blasts you with maple right when you pop the top off, and doesn't stop wowing from there. This beer releases tons of complex, layered scents as you pour, and they keep wafting off the beer as it warms up and you drink. I got tons of maple sugar candy, milk chocolate, and espresso coffee. Not a whole lot of roastiness......it's all decadence and sweet desserty flavorful scent here.
Taste: it is truly amazing how much flavor this brew packs over beers much heavier and barrel-aged. Opens with light milk chocolate and sweet maple syrup, and quickly the flavor deepens, unveiling coffee, darker chocolate flavors, and fudginess. It's one of the most potently flavorful beers I've ever had.
Feel: The only area where I didn't give this beer a 5, I thought it was just a notch light in body, although the light carbonation definitely compliments the flavors well. It's subtle and beautiful, and I actually appreciate the restraint. 
Overall: one of the best beers on the planet. This and Triple Shot, also from TH, are probably my two favorite stouts of all time, and both show that you don't need crazy barrels or a $30 price tag to make a delicious, decadent stout. 1,427 charactersTheElectricOne, Nov 16, 2015
5/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml growler into a Grrrz teku. Shared by schen9303. 
Pours a rich, thick 2 finger coffee colored head with excellent retention. Beer is thick and pitch black. Lacing is layered and thick with fantastic stick. Oily, slick legs that really coat the glass. Don't see how this could be better. 
Nose is rich maple syrup, french toast, espresso beans, chocolate, fudge and roasted cocoa powder. Flavors here are very distinct and insanely aromatic. I'd be content with just smelling this over and over. 
Opens chocolate, maple syrup and espresso. Dank coffee beans, fudge and cocoa powder in the middle with a heavy dose of fudge, chocolate and sweet syrup towards the back. A light tartness from the coffee only serves to enhance the fudge, syrup and chocolate flavors in the end. Espresso beans and mocha in the aftertaste. This is pretty much what every coffee imperial stout ever made wishes it could be. Unbelievable. 
Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Chewy and slick in the mouth and goes down soft, viscous and smooth. Mellow finish with a sticky, lingering aftertaste. Body is perfect and finish and aftertaste leave you wanting more. 
It took over 6 years for me to give my first perfect 5 and I can say confidently that there isn't a beer more deserving. Good Morning is a transcendent beer and as good as Tree House's IPAs are, this offering is on a completely different level. Unbelievable and certainly the best beer I've ever had. 1,457 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 16, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Looks great, pours black, but minimal head. Lots of maple candy aroma. In aroma terms, the maple definitely overwhelms the coffee. You could smell the maple through the bottle/or the residuals from the fill. It smells phenomenal. Flavored coffee tends to err on the side of too sweet. This toes that line somewhat. There is a ton of residual, unfermented sugar that provides some nice sweetness that leads to a decadent mouthfeel. It leaves the flavor of waffle crisp, which is very accessible at local grocery stores. I like this beer, but it is very, very sweet and that kind of takes away from it as a whole. I wish there was more pronounced coffee and roasted malt. The maple overwhelms all. 695 charactersSheppard, Nov 15, 2015

5/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Best coffee RIS punch you in the olfactory I've ever experienced. The maple lets itself be known in spades too...and the taste follows suit. The perfect blend of rich, roasty coffee and authentic tasting maple syrup with little to no alcohol to be found. You also get caramel, vanilla, brown sugar and richest of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is perfect, a bit thicker than KBS and not quite BCBS, but perfectly drinkable.  Looking forward to getting some next time. There is honestly nothing I would change about this, hence the 5. 526 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Nov 15, 2015

Super rich and smooth. Light carbonation. Well deserving of the hype. 366 charactersHootie159, Nov 14, 2015

Pours a rich dark black with a very thick dark brown head that lingers a bit. The smell is rich with coffee, chocolate cake, vanilla, maple. Taste follow all of the smells beautifully, coffee first, chocolate vanilla maple next, coffee to end it with some sweetness. Feel is extremely smooth. This is as good as it gets folks. 334 characterscostanzo_mike, Nov 14, 2015

Taste pretty much follows the nose: roasty coffee with a sweet finish that must be the maple; no maple flavor comes through though.  Mouthfeel is medium to thin and a bit dry surprisingly, maybe from the prominent coffee.  Overall the beer is very drinkable because of the lighter mouthfeel and mellow sweetness.  Very good coffee stout but I can't say there was much maple besides a general sweetness.  Everyone compares this and MD but as far as I can tell these are very different beers that are being compared just because they use the same adjuncts. 654 charactersillini1848, Sep 20, 2015

The look is pitch black with a dark brown head that slowly disappears. The feel is not super thick but not thin eaither. Carbonation is perfect, a very smooth beer to drink. Smells wonderful, mostly of coffee and chocolate with some faint maple. Taste is roasty with a great coffee flavor and loads of chocolate. Can definitely see what people mean by brownie batter with this one. The maple comes last and coats the mouth. A perfect amount of sweetness that is not too over the top. This is a fantastic beer I hope to drink again. One of the best maple beers I have had although there hasn't been too many. 679 charactersahbithwabm, Sep 14, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -9.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25~8oz pour at Hop Jam in Bolton, VT--8/21/15.
Disclaimer: The refrigerated truck that this keg emerged from had the chiller cranked way high to compensate for what was predicted to be a very warm day on the mountain. I received my pour about three minutes after tapping. Consequentially, although I did my damnedest to allow it to warm properly, rather more of my pour than I would have liked was consumed at sub-optimal (literally) temperatures.
Pours a rich, viscous black, mocha highlights faintly visible when held up to the sun. In contrast to many other reviewers, a pleasant but rather tame and short-lived khaki heads sits atop my pour, dissipating after perhaps a minute.
In the nose, chocolate fudge, fresh maple syrup, Muscovado sugar, and medium roast--while the smell as a whole is more muted than I would have expected, when I am able to discern the flavors they are all distinctive and vibrant unto themselves.
Chocolate cake, toffee, cold-brewed coffee, maple syrup, and toasted brown sugar prominent also on the tongue. Although I am again somewhat surprised by the delicacy of the flavors, they are all distinct and fairly assertive in their own rights, and I am struck by how definitely fresh the maple tastes--it is definitely the smooth, slightly earthy sweetness of fresh maple syrup.
Mouthfeel is, to my palate, lovely--robust and pleasantly plump without feeling flabby. Svelte is perhaps an appropriate word here.
On the whole, delighted to have gotten to try this--now I know that, though I thoroughly enjoyed it, I need never brave the appalling lines that inevitably form around its sporadic releases. An exceptional stout, a superb beer--just not worth losing your head over. 1,709 charactersLjudsignal, Sep 13, 2015

Smelled almost entirely of maple syrup with a little bit of chocolate and roast underneath for some backbone.  Taste was similar with the roast coming out a little bit more with the maple on the edges and at the end.  Thick for the ABV, really a good balance here.

5/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Probably the most flavorful beer I have ever had.  Rich notes of coffee and sugar, obviously from the maple syrup.  If you don't want your beer to be coffee flavored or sugary, that could be your excuse to not give this a 100.  It's the best non-barrel aged beer I have had, might be my favorite.

4.79/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured at bottle share night prior to MD release. Growler filled the week prior.
Look- Black as night. Little to no head.
Smell- Strong dark roast coffee, maybe bordering on espresso. Slight sweetness from the maple syrup, but the coffee dominates it.
Taste- Truly a world class coffee stout. Strong roasted coffee with a touch of bitterness. Hints of vanilla and some maple syrup soften it out a bit. Didn't get much of the chocolate notes as mentioned in the description.
Feel- Right on point for a coffee stout. Thick and syrupy. 
Overall- As far as a single purpose coffee stout goes, this is great. If you want a coffee beer and nothing else, I think this is probably the better example when compared to MD. They are both world class and it just really depends on personal taste. The balance and complexity of MD took it to the next level for me. 856 charactersjoecool0909, Sep 10, 2015

Taste is a chocolate coffee explosion, lots of maple in the finish.
Mouthfeel is thick and velvety.
Overall this is an extremely flavorful, delicious stout with a superb mouthfeel.  It is not the most complex stout I've had but the flavors that are there are right on. 438 charactersanteater, Sep 09, 2015

That is not to say it plays second fiddle by any means. This beer was just as amazing. What really stood out to me was the classic pillowy soft body and mouthfeel this beer had for a coffee/maple forward beer. Usually these beers will tend to sway either way on the noticeably sweet or coffee burnt roast/bitter. This beer balanced in harmony with roast and sweet. I could easily drink another glass. Less of a sipper than MD, but it makes sense considering the ABV difference. 573 charactersWynnDavis, Sep 08, 2015

Dark pour and not overpowering. Nose was not that strong and had faint hint of chocolate. The maple was balanced well with the rest of the aromas. However, this almost taste like a watered down Mornin' Delight. Overall a great beer and would love to have again. However, this beer though great, not in the same field as Mornin' Delight. 424 charactersWeezieBone, Sep 07, 2015

Dark pour but not very thick.  Great carbination as it was kept sealed and cold since it was filled.
Smells like coffee, maple and chocolate.  The coffee smells a tad bitter and the maple is a bit subdued.
I like the maple flavor in this one, but the slightly bitter coffee taste knocks it under perfection for me.  The maple came through more in the taste than in the smell.
Mouthfeel was decent, but nothing compares to the TG Stouts (had Mornin Delight right after this)
Overall, great beer, but it is tough to compete with the look, smell, flavor & mouthfeel of Mornin Delight. 662 charactersWI-Beer-Man, Sep 07, 2015

The flavor was similar but got more maple at the beginning than I could smell. Overall this was dang good. I would say the coffee could've been a little less to allow for the maple to show off better. Fwiw I hear a couple months on this beer brings the maple out better.

The nose is of sweet amply syrup, with a more subtle coffee undertone. Kind of surprising given how strong of a coffee flavor their double shot has. The taste is more than expected. Definite maple, coffee, sweet and sticky. Nice think velvet body, but Sioux being syrupy.

Look: Not nearly as viscous. Pours a deep black in the glass. Head isn't nearly as deep brown hued, more of a light chocolate color. 
Smell: Faint amount of maple, some baker's choclolate, that typical Double Shot coffee note. No where near the intensity of Mornin' Delight.
Taste: Softly rolls over the palate with faint hints of maple, chocolate, caramel, a touch of vanilla even. But leaves me yearning for more. 
Feel: I know it's only 8.4%, but it feels like a 5-6% beer. Not thin per se, but definitely the thinner of the two.
Overall: I was so excited to try this as it SHOT to the top of the BA 250 list, but I left feeling like there was more to be desired. Good stuff none the less, but nothing I'd go ape over trying to get. 824 charactersBlackboardbrewing, Sep 04, 2015

GM was superior in smell however, offering a huge maple nose.  Look was very similar to MD, completely opaque dark chocolate. Taste was not as distinct as MD, a bit more muddled, but maple and roastiness were still very much dominating.  GM was a tad thin, but still medium-heavy mouthfeel, not quite as perfectly sticky as MD. Overall solid, hope they get this in bottles soon so I can get something better than a growler. 525 characterswholehop, Sep 02, 2015

The smell alone had me sold -  straight coffee, chocolate, hints of sweet syrup and roasting. Packed with delicious bitter coffee flavor, wonderfully balanced by the maple syrup. The flavors just keep coming, dark brown sugar, vanilla, freshly roasted coffee. The beer is perfectly balanced, not overly sweet. I see some wishing for a heavier mouthfeel, but I thought the carbonation level with all the flavoring you encounter was perfect and still silky smooth; any heavier may have taken away from the complexity of flavors. The lacing left behind on the glass looked like a work of art… to the beer drinkers eye. 659 characterskay_cerino, Aug 31, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 750ml growler filled on 8/15/15 and drank on 8/25.  Is this even a beer?  Beer pours out completely pitch black, but not as thick as I might have expected.  Smells heavily of brownies and chocolate, along with some maple syrup and a decent amount of coffee.  I couldn't stop smelling this beer it was so damn delicious; I just wanted to crawl into the glass.  The taste has all the same flavors as the aroma, but I was surprised at just how strong the coffee flavor was, in a very good way.  I was expecting heavier chocolatey notes, but the coffee took a more central role, especially on the mid palate.  Each sip included multiple waves of flavor, and the sweet tasty maple syrup really makes its presence known on the back end.  Not too sweet though, as the coffee, chocolate and maple favors just are balanced so perfectly, but what else would you expect from TH?  Mouthfeel was not as thick as I would have hoped, but it was still great and smooth as all hell.  I really can't think of anything that I would say needs changing to improve on this beer.  If you can get your hands on this beer anyway other than giving up your first born child, DO SO!  Big thanks to PaddyFrankie for hooking me up with this in a trade when I had to miss this in person at the brewery. 1,285 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Aug 31, 2015

The bubbles give way to aromas of rich milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and dark amber maple syrup. The flavor starts as a blast of milk chocolate, sweet maple syrup, and rich fresh coffee as deeper complexities are uncovered as it warms. The crew here at Tree House tastes “chocolate covered maple candy”, “vanilla”, “chocolate cake”, “brown sugar”, and “fresh roasted coffee”. A super decadent treat, Good Morning begs to be shared and contemplated! 622 charactersJohnBoy243, Aug 29, 2015

I didn't want to buy into the hype on this one, but let's be serious: this is very good.
Solid black pour, brown around the edges, small tan head, spotty lacing. I thought the aroma was a bit lacking honestly, and it almost led me to the old "oh boy, another over-hyped homebrew, here we go." Basically a coffee bomb, roasty. After a sip though, it totally became obvious what was really going on here. Sweet and roasty, maple coffee madness. I hardly ever have a maple beer that actually delivers the maple aspect, but somehow TH really pulled it off in a stellar way. It does fade after a bit though, bringing in brownie batter, fresh coffee, mild bitterness and smoky roastiness, but mostly smooth and satisfying. Burnt marshmallow on the finish. Nice smooth mouthfeel, not completely full-bodied, but darn close. Very nice overall! I'll have to make sure to get more in the future once my measly growlers are gone. 966 charactersRifugium, Aug 28, 2015

4.64/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from growler filled on 8/15.  Resembles thickened black coffee as it's poured into a snifter.  This isn't sludgy motor oil.  
It smells like I'm hovering over a plate of syrup-soaked pancakes and steaming coffee.  I suspect this would be the perfect beer to accompany such a meal.  
The taste follows--sweetened maple notes balanced by roasted bitter coffee.  Just plain tasty.  Not too sweet, not too much char or hop bitterness.
The feel/body is medium, at least at the start.  It seems to get dramatically thicker as it warms.  I would encourage anyone to really let this one warm up to enjoy it at its thickest.  The magic that happens when it warms really makes you forget that this beer hasn't even graced the inside of a barrel.  
Overall, it's a top notch coffee maple stout.  If you like that kind of style, then you'll definitely like this beer. 866 charactersTampaRainman, Aug 26, 2015

4.53/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75When I filled my growler on August 14th of 2015, Good Morning was hovering around 38th on Beer Advocate's Top 250 Beers list. It has since made a miraculous ascent into the number spot on that very list, toppling the hop gods of Pliny the Younger and Heady Topper, claiming the title of Best Beer in the World and crowning itself the ultimate whalezbro beer of ever, brah. 
Before I begin this review, however, I need to give a shout-out to the crew at Tree House, all of whom live by the philosophy that beyond the great taste of their beers, the most important part about their operation is taking care of their customers. Even after a ridiculous swarm of people crashed through their doors like zombies and waited impatiently for hours seeking a fill of Good Morning, every single member of the Tree House staff made it a point to personally thank me by my first name for buying a single $12 fill of their beer. It was classy. It made me feel appreciated. It made me feel glad to tip $2 to Tree House Dean and the crew, who subsequently rang the cow bell twice and loudly proclaimed the words, "Real big tippah!" as I exited the brewery. 
Now, when I first heard about this beer in 2014, beer nerds from across New England expressed their overwhelming favor for Good Morning by telling me that it was, "the best non-barrel aged stout ever made" and that it had, "the best mouthfeel of any beer ever." Then, people I respect in the craft beer community began reflecting those very same sentiments, and suddenly, it became the must have tick on my short list of slayable and locally obtainable whales. 
Tonight, I finally had my first taste of Good Morning. The following is a review of my experience. 
Look: This bad boy is dark. Visualize an eggplant in low light whose purplish hues have faded to evening twilight, topped with a low to medium head that resembles the foam that forms on the top of your favorite carton of chocolate milk after a healthy schoolyard shake. 
Smell: Similar to Double Shot, Good Morning presents with a heavy and pronounced coffee note, though little else -including the maple syrup- is discernible on the nose, perhaps due to olfactory habituation, coupled with a diminished and impatient desire on my end to fully delve into the scents of what I already knew would be a really good beer. 
Taste: Blasts of maple syrup and coffee that hits your palate in three distinct waves of flavors, all quite pleasant, each invitingly warm and harmonious in their union. Not overly sweet or complex; near masterfully executed. Had real Vermont maple syrup been used (and I am talking about the true Vermont maple syrup sourced from the far northern stretches of the Northeast Kingdom, AKA the real Vermont, not the pooled and blended garbage from the commercial maple syrup farms), this beer may have received another slight bump in its score. In its current state, undeniably a very good beer.  I was expecting fireworks and unicorns; I wound up with beer, which I drank and thoroughly enjoyed. 
Feel: Others had described this beer as having a "perfect", "luscious", "sumptuous", "heavenly", and "delightful" mouthfeel, though my first experience with this beer led to a far less enthusiastic selection of words to describe how this beer felt in my mouth. Perhaps I was expecting something more unctuous, along the lines of what others described as their, "chewy, creamy, thick" mouthfeel, when in reality what I got was something far thinner, along the lines of a nice porter. 
Overall: I would have to agree with earlier statements made by fellow members of Beer Advocate in confirming that Good Morning is -at this moment in time- the best non-barrel aged stout in the world. 
I found myself conflicted, though, wanting to rate this beer even higher than I did -due to both the extreme difficulty involved with acquiring it and the aura of hype surrounding its holy grail status- but as logic sensibly prevailed, I came to the conclusion that Good Morning is "a very good beer" that has not quite transcended into the realm of great and amazing beers just yet. 
It is not the best beer I have ever had and it is by no means life changing. 
The one thing that came to mind while reviewing this beer, though, was that Good Morning felt like a very simple beer to me in the sense that there was very little thinking involved with the actual drinking of the beer. Everything came together quite nicely, and while there were no elements that challenged my perspectives or made me rethink my views on craft beer, Tree House delivered on a solid beer that put a smile on my face and made my evening. 
In time, I would like to revisit this beer. Until then, I am left having satisfied a curiosity. 4,728 charactersrodmanfor3, Aug 26, 2015

A - Black.  Maybe a tiny bit of ruby red on the very bottom of the glass.  A nice dark beige head, about 3/4 of a finger.  Not much left now after a minute or two, just some small bubbles.  This thing laces like crazy.  Good looking stuff.
N - Whoa.  Dude.  There is coffee for sure, but the syrup is dominant here.  Good morning indeed.  One of the best smelling beers I've had.
T - Hmm, not really what I expected.  I expected a blast of roasted malt, a blast of coffee, and a blast of maple.  But it's actually extremely smooth and easy drinking.  The flavors are almost subtle compared to the nose.  Is this the best tasting stout I've ever had?  I don't think it's better than CBS.  This is almost sinful how easy drinking it is.
M - This coats everywhere.  Like by the time I decide to swallow it's not even liquid; it's only froth.  I am drinking a fantastic capuccino.
O - Lives up to the hype?  Just about.  I was honestly expecting a much bigger punch flavor-wise.  Regardless, this is one of the most impressive beers I've had. 1,146 charactersCraftFan5, Aug 26, 2015

The taste is everything you smell in this beer coming together in a perfect blend and the beer is very soft and bubbly leaving you wanting more.

From the pitch black look to the rich beautiful smell of fresh coffee, and an abundance of maple syrup.

L: Pours a deep, impenetrable black with 2 fingers of dark khaki head. Man this looks great.
S: Smells of strong black coffee mixed with sweet maple syrupy goodness. Some nice chocolate notes come through as well.  This is definitely one of the best smelling beers out there. 
T: My taste buds are overcome with emotion. I literally, cannot fathom the greatness that I am tasting. Strong, flavorful coffee explodes and eventually gives way to a sweet maple finish. The transition from bitter coffee to sweet maple is one of the best transitions I've ever experienced. This is truly incredible.
F: A thick, chewy imperial stout is definitely what this is. There is absolutely no alcohol to speak of and I could easily polish off a growler of this... Which I will indeed do.
Overall: This beer is phenomenal. I don't think I've ever had a better beer. Tree House continues to churn out world class beers. And among a catalog of world class beers, this is definitely the best one of the bunch. As a man of many words, I am truly speechless upon tasting this beer.

  Look is beautiful black, opaque pour with finger-sized khaki-colored head.  Dissipates rather quickly and lacing is spotty
  The nose is beautiful ; freshly roasted coffee beans, dark espresso, big chocolate and the maple sweetness peeks through as well.
  The first taste is a mixture of coffee and chocolate cake/chocolate fudge.  Awesome!  The maple plays support in this one and it works beautifully, just peaking in there to add a little more sweetness.  I love that they did not go over the top choosing a middle-tier size of 8.4% abv.  It allows this beer to really shine and not even be bothered by the presence of booziness.
  Feel is heavy-medium.  Amazing creaminess that, when allowed to just sit on your tongue for a few seconds, takes you to Calgon-world. 
  I really thought this was gonna fall short of expectations because of ALL the hype.  But, jeez, this was one phenomenal beer. 975 charactersJamesStreet, Aug 22, 2015

Yes separate growlers I didn't decide to age it myself. If you don't drink this immediately then you will lose everything this wonderful beast had to offer you. This beer becomes a shell of what it is in a few short days. I wish that they would bottle this beer. This review is for my fresh batch rating.
Look- if this beer were a female I would say "Damn that girl has got legs for days" seriously this beers got legs.
Smell- loads of coffee, smells like breakfast is on the table with pancakes
Taste - explosion of perfectly balanced roasty, smooth, espresso like coffee. Truly brilliant coffee flavor that makes you feel like you are having a cup of Joe. Yeah I said Joe.
Feel- probably the thickest beer I've ever had. Mouth feel is perfect.
Overall- *warning* drink your beer fresh, the mouth feel is the first thing to go and with just an extra 3 days of age had completely fallen off. Coffee was still nice but just a shell.

special beer, right up near the top of my list.  the nose is obscene (think MBCP), obviously dominated by maple syrup.  i wouldn't usually notice this but the smell persisted in the glass for a couple hours after i was done drinking it.  the taste is amazing, again maple dominates, but the coffee provides a nice balance.  you'll want to hammer it down but be patient, it gets noticeably better as it warms.  the hype is real here. 467 charactersthirstyturtle, Aug 21, 2015

4.74/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a growler which leaked slightly on its way down to Florida. Poured dark brown with a one finger tan head which lingers for a while before giving way. Aroma is rich and decadent with maple syrup, coffee, malt, mocha, and semi-sweet, dark chocolate. I'm down to the last few sips as I write this and the aroma is still going strong. The taste follows the nose. Maple syrup and coffee are amazing, but the flavor really sets itself apart with the varying layers of chocolate. Each sip delivers a different variation - mocha, bitter dark chocolate, creamy vanilla with milk chocolate, fluffy cake, dense fudge, and chocolate chip pancake. There's a lot of malt as well, both sweet, candied malt as well as roasted malt and a bitter astringent note from the coffee that cuts through the sweetness perfectly and keeps everything in balance. The mouth feel is  medium, fluffy, and smooth with just enough carb to keep it moving. I was expecting a light to medium mouth feel based on abv, but was pleasantly surprised by how full it was. I don't want it to be any bigger. The lower abv and mouth feel allow a variety of new experiences to emerge with each sip - malted milkshake, marshmallow, mocha cappuccino, espresso. This is a supremely well-crafted beer. World class. 1,276 charactersdanh53, Aug 21, 2015

Looks exactly how an imperial coffee stout is supposed to look. Black with about a half inch of brown head that sticks around a while, but doesn't linger.
The nose is huge with maple, dark coffee, and a hint of chocolate. I need a perfume like this.
Taste explodes with deep maple syrup up front, transitions into a deep roasted coffee, almost a Cuban coffee. Finishes with a smooth chocolate/caramel flavor. Slight bitterness from the dark coffee and roasted malt.
The feel is quite sugary, definitely due to the maple syrup, but it balances out the bitterness perfectly. 
Overall, a fantastic beer. A must have for coffee and stout lovers alike. 798 charactersajcuster89, Aug 20, 2015

Pours as black as deep space, with just a touch of coffee colored head. 
Smells like breakfast. Coffee, pancakes with pure maple syrup, maybe some chocolate chips and sugar on top. 
Tastes exactly like it smells, with the addition of vanilla, and the perfect balance of sweetness from the maple and bitterness from the coffee. Let it warm and you taste everything differently. The coffee bitterness turns to dark chocolate, and the maple sweetness is joined by doughy pancake/doughnut flavor. 
Mouthfeel is creamy and sweet. Medium to thick bodied. 
Overall, the best beer I've ever had. Find a way to get your hands on this. 719 charactersTheOneTC, Aug 19, 2015

Look - Inky, black tar in appearance with a coffee colored head of tiny bubbles. Like a fine cappuccino.
Smell - Absolute Heaven.  Dark coffee, maple syrup, vanilla and marshmallow completely delighted my senses. When I wasn't drinking this stout I was enjoying the aromas. As this stout warms a bit it's even better - I want my house to smell like this all the time!
Taste - Even better than it smells. Again like the nose my taste buds were attacked my splendid dark cappuccino and maple flavors with delicious nuances of vanilla and dark chocolate covered marshmallows. Again, as this beer warms a bit these flavors open up like a fine brandy/bourbon. This beer is smooth and sweet - a great way to end a great meal with a group of friends.
Feel - Thick, creamy, and sweet with bittersweet finish. There is just so much going on with this beer and in a GOOD way. Sticky finish - this is s true luxurious dessert or a filling breakfast.
Overall - BEYOND outstanding - an absolute World Class beer IMO. So happy we went every day this beer was on tap so that I can experiment with this beers development in the bottle. 1,237 charactersMatthewHopHead, Aug 18, 2015

A: pours inky black, opaque with a 1 finger light tan head. Sticky lacing, looks frothy and thick in the glass.
S: huge amount of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow and roastiness on the nose. Smells sweet but I don't get distinct maple syrup. 
T: upfront lots of coffee and chocolate, slight roast. Sweet but not over done. Then you get maple syrup, wood, vanilla, pancake notes. In the mid palate there is a acidic coffee note that I found a little distracting. Get a hint of the alcohol without any alcohol burn. 
M: medium to thick, the coffee and carbonation make the body very creamy. 
O: tastes like a thick creamy iced coffee poured on pancakes (all in a good way) and one of the best coffee stouts I have ever had. Probably one of the best noses on a beer in recent memory for me, may have to go with how fresh the beer was. The maple syrup was a great addition and not overpowering. The acidic note, (I'm guessing from the coffee) was the only drawback for me and hard to get over.  
Definitely a beer worth seeking out. Shared with a group of friends who ranged from casual beer drinkers to geeks and everyone enjoyed it. 1,191 charactersRaj, Aug 16, 2015

Score: 97
Six week old growler (my bad) served in a Bourbon County snifter and enjoyed on 11/06/14 after being stored in a low-temp fridge continuously. Thank you immensely Rudzud for sending me this one!
Appearance: Pours an inky black color with a half finger of tan head that settles to a bubbly ring around the glass. Excellent lacing and lengthy retention with a high cling factor on the residuals. Gorgeous stout. 5/5
Smell: The aroma is a perfect trifecta of coffee, chocolate and maple syrup. Lovely roastiness too. This one rivals Morning Delight, through Morning Delight has a bolder chocolate character, if memory serves. While there is no mistaking this one for a kitchen cooking up fresh chocolate chip pancakes, it is still excellent. 5/5
Taste: Bold mix of coffee and maple syrup, with lots of maple flavor without much sweetness. The coffee character is stronger on the taste than it was present in the nose. There is not a big chocolate presence in the flavor. Coffee upfront with a long syrupy finish. Has a great balance between bitterness and sweetness, no booziness. I am frankly shocked by how much maple is present without this brew being sweet. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, appropriately low level of carbonation. Lovely bittersweet balance, lasting and coating flavors. 4.75/5
Overall: This is an amazing beer. I cannot imagine how much better this is even fresher, at which point I am sure it rivals Toppling Goliath's Morning Delight even moreso. My only knock here is the muted chocolate on the taste, but that is splitting hairs since there is a lovely 1-2 punch of coffee followed by maple, with a great mouthfeel and balance to boot. Seek this one out, you will not be disappointed. This was one of the best new beers I encountered in 2014.
Cost: $12 for a 750 ml flip-top growler (+$6 for the glass). 1,928 charactersjegross2, Aug 15, 2015
4.55/5  rDev -4.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Perfect looking stout. Poured a jet black with nice size tan head and some amazing lacing down the glass.
S: Perfect smelling stout. Smelt like some morning chocolate chip pancakes. I picked up some coffee, chocolate, and some maple.
T: Follows the nose quite well. I get at first a lot of coffee taste/ bitterness then balanced by the maple sweetness. Underlying is some chocolate taste. A delicious stout thats very unique. My complaint is I was getting a very weird aftertaste on my toungue. But i honestly couldnt tell if it was the beer or something wrong with my glass/ some taste stuck in my mouth.
F: Very good for a stout. Nice thicker/ creamy feeling to it. Didnt give it a 5 because of that bad aftertaste i got that kind of stuck to my tongue.
O: Without that odd aftertaste its one of the best, and a very unique stout. 836 charactersGinjaSlice, Aug 15, 2015
5/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Maple to this degree is one of the most difficult flavors to accomplish with how readily syrup attenuates. This is unbelievable, it's taking me forever to write this because I don't want to put my glass down. Belgian waffles dripping in rich syrup. Perfectly roasted coffee that is neither overly bitter or too dominating of the flavor profile. Milk chocolate drizzle tying it all together with just the perfect amount of sweetness in perfect harmony. As somebody who has had a lot of what treehouse has to offer this is undoubtably the king of the castle. Wowed by everything this one brinhs to the table. 606 charactersVetsPackage, Aug 15, 2015

Smell: morning coffee pancakes soaked in maple syrup
Taste: coffee slight chocolate with maple syrup sweetness.
Feel: warming, thick with maple syrup tones. Your mouth will feel as if it has been coated with maple syrup flavor
Overall: probably best stout I have ever tasted. Sweetness with maple syrup flavor lingering after each sip. Warms you to sleep. Not sure how this was brewed while maintaining the flavors so well. I havent had every stout in the world, but I can barely imagine a better one. 570 charactersCraftBeerLos, Aug 15, 2015

A: Midnight black with a thin dark mocha lacing that sticks to the glass.
S: Maple syrup pops out, along with medium/dark coffee, vanilla and some brown sugar. I thought I smelled some chocolate like fudge, but only smelled it once.
T: Unlike the nose, the first thing I can taste is a rich blend of coffee then brown sugar and some sweet maple.
M: Thick syrupy like, moderate amount of carbonation, slight coffee bitterness, smooth mouthfeel overall.
O: Between the coffee and the maple syrup this one is a real treat. I'm not sure what kind of coffee they used, but as it warms it reminds me of Double Shot 3rd Anniversary with maple syrup added to it. Excellent!!!!! 838 charactersMA_hops, Aug 14, 2015

Smell is lots of maple syrup and brown sugar with a hint of roasted coffee.  Taste is bitter dark cocoa with espresso and a slight brown sugar sweetness.  Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than I expected but is silky and creamy like a dark chocolate mocha with half and half.  Overall this is  one of the best stouts I have ever had.  I have not had Morning Delight but this is in the same league as KBBS.  The aftertaste is very bitter and could use some smoothing out but the balance and flavor profiles are impeccable.  Good morning indeed. 626 charactersIrishColonial, Apr 14, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This one deserves a write-up. 
L - Bible black, with a thin mocha lacing. Coats the glass to reveal some nice legs, though I'm certain it is no sign of age in this case. 
S - Coffee basically dominates everything in this beer. But this isn't some generic instant coffee. This is like the finest peaberry coffee you're too cheap to buy yourself on a regular basis but are happy buy for others as a gift. And for those who don't take it black, you'll be happy to know that a subtle maple syrup aroma restrains any burnt/bitter characteristics often found in these types of stouts.
T - The same rich coffee notes found in the smell, followed by that faint but still noticeably present maple sweetness, making itself known in the finish. I must point out that this balances beautifully with a rather pleasant bitterness from the coffee, which is quite different from the kind of bitterness found in hoppier beers. And there really is no mistaking the sweeter aspects for anything other than maple syrup, whatever other adjuncts may or may not have been added to this beer. The tasting points may seem simple here, but it is the richness, the quality and the balance which amaze even those increasingly jaded drinkers like myself. 
M - Thicker than coffee, thinner than syrup, a pleasant, mouth coating texture found somewhere in between. This texture really helps you visualize the maple syrup component, where the look of the beer might help you visualize the coffee.   
O - Somehow, magically, I have managed to enjoy this beer on 4 separate occasions. Twice at Extreme Beer Fest, once from my own growler purchased at the brewery, and once through a friend's growler purchase. It may be the best beer I have ever had and is definitely the best stout I've ever had. And yet, no bourbon age on this one. Just maple syrup and coffee. But that "just" utterly belies the blissful marriage of elements at play in this beer, which are all beyond reproach. On my first try, I drank this back to back with Founders CBS, another maple stout. I immediately found the latter to be overly sweet and a tad synthetic in character. This only served to emphasize how much the components of this beer tasted real, of the earth. And this is basically why it is a perfect beer. 2,261 charactersWantonFaun, Apr 03, 2015

Rich, decadent coffee flavor is accentuated by just the right amount of maple. Liquid chocolate chip pancakes with syrup and coffee drizzled on top. It smells fantastic and the taste matches the nose almost perfectly. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carb. 406 charactersNav71292, Mar 25, 2015

The flavor follows with that chocolate cake, fudge note up front. Then onto a maple sweetness the melds well with the beer onto a theme of roasted coffee and coffee caramel candy. 
The mouthfeel is medium to medium plus.
I will say, having this next to Triple Shot, I prefer that beer. A wonderful beer, but a touch overrated. 428 charactersdar482, Mar 23, 2015

4.87/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Got two samples, 4 oz total, on tap at EBF in Boston, MA. I wish I could've gotten more.
This one pours a dark and oily black, with a very small foamy head, and a not a whole lot of lacing.
This one smells magnificent, but surprisingly more coffee-forward than maple. There's honestly not a whole lot of maple on the nose, but the coffee is so delicious smelling. Roasty, dark, and slightly sweet, there's also some chocolate, and just a hint of maple.
Luckily, the taste brings a big maple explosion. The wonderful coffee flavor is still there, but the finish is all sticky, syrupy, sweet maple, really fresh tasting, really authentic. It's so thick tasting, I've only had a few beers of this thickness. I'm really sad I didn't just camp out at the Tree House table the entire night.  There's some great chocolate syrup flavor too, with a bit of caramel and molasses at times.
This is very thick, syrupy, but not overly so, with a lower level of carbonation, and a very full mouthfeel. Very drinkable.
This is one of the best stouts in the country. Perfect use of maple and coffee. Stunned. 1,096 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 23, 2015

Pours an inky, black, oily, thick body that instantly produces a rising dark mocha colored, light-to-dark textured soft frothy head that reduces very slowly, leaving blotchy lacing and an uneven layer of light brown foam. 
Let this one warm up to let the aromas develop and come through. Holy.. this beer reminds me of the wonderful aromas one would experience when first walking into a bakery.. extremely decadent, rich, complex, EXTREMELY inviting. How one earth do I begin to describe the aromas coming from this beer? Take the most delicious dessert you ever had and put it in aroma form.. rich french vanilla, super roasted rich freshly ground coffee, fresh brownies and cake, maple syrup, slight jammy fruits, anise, charred malt, sugar cookies. I can't wait to sip this.
Taste is equally as decadent and complex, rich freshly ground coffee, sugar cookie, maple candies, dark chocolate chip brownies, cocoa, finish is roasty and toasty. So incredibly delicious. The mouthfeel is rich, heavy, full-bodied, low carbonation. Absolutely fantastic. 
I was blown away by this beer. I enjoyed it over two hours and it just got better and better as it warmed and the flavors and aromas opened up. It was absolutely amazing, and as rated the best beer I've ever had. The complexity, uniqueness, balance, and flavors are out of this world. Seek this out. 1,456 charactersgcamparone, Mar 21, 2015

A: pours black and viscous with a 3/4 finger dark chocolate mocha head. beautiful sticky lacing. 
s: nutty, roasty, coffee aroma hits you up front with a hint if maple sweetness that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. like coffee maple candy... i wonder if such a thing exists. 
T: delicious nutty roasted coffee dominates, with notes of chocolate, creamy coffee ice cream w/ a touch of maple syrup drizzled on. All the flavors work together very nicely here. nothing overpowers. the maple syrup seems to add just the right amount of sweetness to round out the delicious roastyness going on here. 
M: velvety and viscous and not extremely heavy. A bit sticky and chewy as well, coats the inside of the mouth and tongue with a roasty maple sugar residue that lingers delightfully.
O: this beer is an awesome decadent treat. So good in so many ways, and i have yet to meet someone who has tried this beer and not loved it. My g/f who "hates stouts" now tries them all because of this beer. I think she may love it even more then i do. One of the top beers of the year... hands down. 1,146 charactersPeterIngemi, Jan 18, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Outstanding beer. I've had the good fortune of trying three different batches (have there been more?) and while the first had the best mouthfeel, I've been blown away every time. The Tree House crew is spot on with all the flavors in their description. A truly decadent desert beer. I haven't had Mornin Delight so I can't compare, but the only beer that might beat this one is Filthy Rich by Lively Brewing.
Very impressed by the maple in this one. I've heard how difficult it is to brew with maple, yet these guys do it with the real stuff, Grade A no less. A true testament to their brewing ability. 
I can get used to the best beers in the world being breakfast stouts!
EDIT 2015/12/25
Figured I'd do a full-blown review while sipping on this perfect Christmas morning brew. 
L - thick, dark, with a creamy mocha head. Decent retention even after a month+ in the bottle. Gently swirling leaves the lacing latched onto the edges of the glass, climbing to get up the walls. Leaves a nice tan ring as the beer sits. 
S - Maple! Huge notes of rich maple syrup. It ain't superficial either. This smells more like genuine maple syrup than some of the Grade A shit I've got in PA or VT! Deep and chocolately, maple permeates the senses with a dark coffee roast around the edges. 
T - my aroma description nails the taste as well. Coffee comes out in full force, muscling its way to the front of the sensory line. Milk chocolate syrup drizzled on decadent German chocolate cake. Maple burns it's way into the back of the throat. Insane amount of flavor. Overwhelms the entire surface area of my tongue. Extremely pleasant aftertaste. Lingering maple, subtle bittersweet chocolate. A real treat. A true Christmas miracle!
F - velvety smooth and creamy. On the lighter side; serves to give me a break from the onslaught of flavor! Brewing with maple is hard and often sacrifices thickness, which is what has happened here, but Tree House makes the best of it and turns it all around into one beautiful package. 
O - one of the greatest beers I've had the fortune of pouring down my throat. Smashes to shit all the senses. Too good.
EDIT 2016/12/25
Hoping to make this a Christmas tradition. Now they just have to brew it again! Last one from the Nov 2015 batch. 
Age has done this beer good. It has changed, but not necessarily for better or worse. The coffee has settled down quite a bit, giving way to a monstrous maple bomb. Tons of cinnamon, vanilla, and mocha caramel cream. Positively decadent and the most maple I've ever tasted in a beer. Drinks like lightly warmed-up Grade A maple syrup poured on a fat stack of pancakes loaded up with butter. Which is weird, because it's cold! Amazing sensations. 2,714 charactersagreenman19, Jan 16, 2015

A: Inky black pour with a brown head that settles after a time. Spotty lacing.
S: Rich and nutty coffee. Moist double chocolate cake. Blackstrap molasses. Dark maple syrup. Maple candy. Subtle berry fruits deep within. Very well balanced, and it all comes together very easily.
T: Rich double chocolate cake. Fudge sauce. Dark maple syrup. Maple candy. Nutty coffee. Tight berry fruitiness is glossed over quickly. Very sweet with only a thin acidic bitterness to balance, but it never becomes too much to bear. Subtle alcohol. Nutty coffee, maple, and chocolate sauce on the finish.
M: Thick and big in body. Slicky and sugary in texture with some silky roundness too. Low tingling carbonation.
O: Sweet and straightforward, but it has that seamless balance of flavors that separates the great beers from the good ones. Tasty as hell. A real pleasure to drink. 902 charactersryan1788a5, Jan 14, 2015

It looks like a decadent dessert, smells like heaven, and makes your taste buds sing with delight. The balance is incredible: too much maple syrup and this would have been cloying; too little and it would be just another (albeit high quality) coffee stout. The carbonation level is absolutely dead-on. Don't drink it too cold, as it needs some warmth to really expose its strengths.
This is a total beer. Up there in my top 10 of all time. Seek it out. 494 charactersbrikelly, Jan 13, 2015

4.43/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Nearly a black opaque color, but some amber/brown hues on the edges if held in the right light.  Just about a fingers length of a mocha colored head. 
Aroma- Tons of coffee aromas pour out of this as as soon as the flip top is popped.  As it warms up the  coffee becomes a little more subdued and the maple syrup begins to dominate the aromas.  
Taste- The taste follows a similar pattern as the nose as roasted coffee is very noticeable at the start, but warmth brings out the maple syrup sweetness and the coffee subdues.  Some milk chocolate comes out as well when this warms up.
Feel- Very little carbonation, full bodied, and chewy texture from the maple syrup.
Overall- Coffee and maple syrup make for an amazing combination in this beer.  Only thing I wish is that the roasted coffee stayed as it warms up.  This drinks like a coffee stout at first, but then it fades out way too much as it warms up the syrup dominates and is verges on being too sweet at times.  If the coffee stayed this would probably be 5 beer for me.  Other than that the mouthfeel and aroma are great, and this is definitely worth going out of ones way to get. 1,156 charactersCTbrew32, Jan 06, 2015

S - Freshly ground espresso beans, almost overpowering but quickly gets equalized by the pure local maple syrup, just at the right time. Hints of vanilla. 
T - Just as flawless as the smell. Espresso at first, then vanilla-y pure maple syrup on the back end. 
M - Not too thick, true to form for an 8-9% imperial stout. A tad bit of maple residue almost seems to stick on the lips. 
O - The definition of an imperial coffee maple stout. No traces of smoke flavor at all, which I very much so appreciate that I find too often in other imperial stouts. 668 charactersBelimo3102, Jan 03, 2015

Appearance: black bodied beer with medium to dark mocha colored head. Head drops down to a thin cap. 
Smell: maple syrup bomb with a medium roast coffee. Hint of chocolates.
Taste: Very maple syrup forward. Medium roast expresso beans and a hint of coffee creamer.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low carbonation levels.  Creamy carbonation and a thick oily body. Super smooth not boozey at all.
Overall: Treehouse really did a nice maple coffee stout.  It falls slightly short of TG Mornin' Delight, but those are some hard shoes to fill. If the balance of the maple and coffee was a little better this would have been as flawless as Mornin' Delight.  Either way you spin it...Treehouse really did a fantastic job with this stout! Get it while you can!!! 821 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Nov 17, 2014

A- Dark brown body, almost opaque to the point where it's nearly black. Despite being shipped in a growler, this comes with the perfect two finger medium mocha head with just the right amount of retention time- long enough to admire the head, but not long enough that you can't start digging into the beer right away. This beer doesn't have much lacing, but it certainly does have legs. [4.5]
S- Intense and impressive nose off the bat. Freshly ground espresso roast. Caramel and hazelnut. Milk chocolate sweetness. Decadent maple syrup sweetness adds an extra dimension and balances out the coffee scents perfectly. This smells like breakfast in a glass. [4.75]
F- Smooth, impeccable combination of a fresh pourover and slick maple syrup character. The coffee is moderately acidic with a splash of roasted malt and a shot of milk chocolate sweetness that is eventually taken over by sweet, slick maple syrup goodness. Caramel, nuttiness rounds it out. Surprisingly, this beer can be described as both sweet and bitter; just occurring at different points in the palate which themselves also change as the beer warms up. It is more on the bitter, coffee-forward side when initially served chilled, balancing out over time with the maple syrup sweetness with a constant presence of roast and milk chocolate, eventually finishing with a moderate coffee bean bitterness. Very well constructed with a ton of complexity. [4.75]
M- Slick and sticky on the finish, full and substantial body that coats the tongue in alternating bitter earthy coffee and sticky sweet maple syrup flavours. Very easy to drink with a lot of complexity. No heat, very manageable ABV. The combined aftertaste of freshly brewed coffee and maple syrup simply just doesn't go away. And I definitely don't want it to go away. [4.5]
O- It's hard to find any faults with this beer, but easy to start playing the inevitable comparison game. I have to conclude that this is every bit as good as Toppling Goliath's Mornin' Delight. It has just as much maple syrup character to the beer; where it differs is that the coffee character is noticeably stronger while the milk chocolate, roast malt from the base beer is found further into the background. It's splitting hairs at this point though- any day that I get to drink a beer like this is an excellent one, and today is no exception. To the fine folks in Monson, keep up the great work! [4.75]

A- Growler poured to a tulip with a thick, oily consistency and a big several finger light brown cap. The body is black but some dark brown can be found. Lacing is ample and a combo of splotches, drizzle and webs cascading around the glass.
S- Seriously walking into a maple syrup company; a nearly obscene level of maple saturates the nose. Fresh, earthy maple not like that supermarket syrup, the real stuff. I can't help but think of pancakes with the chocolate aromas and the coffee only completes the breakfast theme to it all.
T- Once again a maple forward brew but a lot more is noticeable in the flavor. Medium-dark roast coffee is also huge and it joins the maple to be most of the flavor for me. Semi-bitter chocolate, a moderate sweetness, dark caramel and some toasty and roasted grains round it all out. An amazing coffee bean flavor seems to oscillate on and off the taste buds but when I get it, it's fantastic.
MF- Super creamy and fairly thick bodied with a medium high carbonation that falls onto the palate like a pillow, smooth. Somewhat oily and chewy with a very slightly warm and roasty bitter finish.
A big beer as it drops a massive dose of coffee and maple on the taste buds with plenty of roast malt notes beyond that. By far the most maple forward beer I have had and the delicious coffee is huge too. Somewhat absurd at times but honestly I would buy this as a fridge regular if it was available as such. 1,518 characterscbutova, Nov 13, 2014

750ml growler filled last week, split with cbutova last night.
A - Thick almost-black pour with a small tan head. Retains as a ring and patchy cap leaving strands and bits of lace.
S - Maple coffee chocolate croissant pastry madness. Gooey caramel icing. Absurdly rich and dessert-like without being cloying. Worthy of wows.
T - Just a ridiculous maple coffee pancake bomb, with chocolate sweetness and slight roast. Reminds me of chocolate chip pancakes, brownies and maple cream. It is very rich but never really comes off as overly sweet. An absurd wtf otherworldly dreamy breakfast stout.
M - Thick and luscious with good medium carbonation and some very light alcohol warmth. Richness makes this is a sipper, probably best in small doses but so damn tasty.
O - Oof, wow, this is total maple coffee steroid beer, there are only remnants of a stout underneath it all. I would like to maybe see it more well-rounded or balanced but that is made up for with really really excellent quality flavors. If you like maple and coffee trying this should probably become top priority. 1,097 charactersChico1985, Nov 11, 2014

A- pours pitch black with an inch of mocha head. Head dissipates slowly into a thin lace that covers the top of the beer.
S- coffee definitely comes in first. Roasty and bitter. Then tons of maple sits behind it forcing it's way through the coffee. Sweet syrupy goodness.
T- follows the nose almost exactly. Strong coffee with a slight bitterness. The maple is sweet and thick and covers the palate. The maple lasts on the back end and mixes with the chocolate that tastes kinda like a candy bar. 
M- creamy mouthfeel but a little thinner than i expected. Not thin by any means but a medium thickness. 
O- very solid beer. Beats out black maple by a long shot. If the coffee was a little smoother this would be close to a 5. 779 charactersmlhyatt, Nov 09, 2014

Someone said it smelled like dunking donuts should smell and I can't agree more. And the taste, holy shit! This thing is so rich with flavor and almost tastes like a desert rather than a beer.

Appearance: Pours black and leaves a tan/brown head that starts dark brown and fades to a tan as it fades, before falling to a tan layer upon the beer. (4.75)
Smell: Roasty coffee, maple syrup, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, chocolate malts. Really nice balance of all the delicious flavors. Not overwhelming, just right. (4.75)
Taste: Big roasty coffee, milk chocolate, caramel, chocolate malts, and finishes with sweet maple syrup and just a touch of heat. Wonderful array of flavors all blended flawlessly together. Such balance too, I could drink a lot of this. (4.75)
Mouth-feel: Low to medium carb with a medium, creamy body that swells in my mouth as I roll it around. Finishes super smooth. (4.5)
Overall: This is such a balanced, yet almost decadent stout. The sweet flavors of maple syrup, caramel and toffee mix right in with the coffee and malts. Drinking this fresh was definitely a good idea as all the flavors are popping right now. Delicious. (4.75) 1,108 charactersResuin, Nov 06, 2014

Served in a snifter
The beer poured an inky jet black and looked shimmery in the glass. A frothy, one-finger tall, tan colored crown topped the liquid and slowly faded to a thin, bubbly ring. Spotty lacing clung to the glass.
The aroma was outstanding. Intense espresso notes dominated. Ground espresso beans particularly came to mind. Rich and fragrant with loads of fresh vanilla. Chocolate and maple syrup notes came through as well. Rather sweet overall, but quite amazing.
Like the nose, the flavor profile was super rich and robust with immense amounts of French roast coffee, espresso and roasted malts. Dark amber maple syrup and vanilla came through strong in the center. Some semisweet chocolate as well. Bitter roast and crushed espresso beans appeared in the finish. The bitterness on the back end actually helped keep the sweetness in check. A touch of ashiness lingered on the palate.
The mouthfeel was rich and creamy. A super fine, slick carbonation turned the beer frothy and fluffy on the palate. After each sip, the liquid left a slightly sticky film on my lips.
I really loved Tree House's Double Shot, and Good Morning takes that beer and cranks it up to eleven. Although this is an intensely flavored imperial stout, its rather modest ABV means that you can drink a fair amount of it in a sitting. Now, if only they would do a bourbon barrel aged version of this. 1,488 charactersDamian, Nov 06, 2014

S - The first whiff was all coffee, but subsequent whiffs were all maple.  Once you get past those flavors you get vanilla.
T - This is SO maple-forward it's ridiculous. It may be called a coffee stout with maple syrup, but it's more like a maple syrup stout with coffee. Not much else I pick up, but it doesn't matter when the end result is this good. Some coffee ground taste lingers a bit too long, but I'm just looking for things to complain about at this point.
F - Thick and smooth with no alcohol taste. I killed my 750ml growler is half an hour - I just couldn't stop drinking it.
O - Mind-bottling 666 charactersThrewRedButter, Nov 04, 2014
5/5  rDev +4.8%So smooth.  I thought Ten Fidy was the smoothest imperial stout until I have this creation.  It looks like motor oil, smells like the perfect French press steeped coffee, and tastes like New England looks in the fall - magical.   It's creamy, rich, well balanced and never overpowering.  May well be my favorite beer from Tree House. 333 charactersKOrtyl, Nov 02, 2014

A: Pours a deep, dark brown with a dark mocha head with nice retention and lacing.
S:  The smell is excellent, rich maple syrup, roasted coffee beans, maybe some vanilla and a hint of chocolate.  
T:  The taste is exactly as you'd expect this beer to taste from the smell, huge amounts of maple upfront, rich and sweet and smooth.  The bit of chocolate that you smell comes in next and is more prevalent than you'd expect but pairs nicely with the maple.  The finish is a where the coffee comes into play and perfectly I might add, not too strong and not too subtle, a perfect pairing with the maple and chocolate.
M: The mouth feel is nice a creamy, medium bodied, nice and smooth with hardly any note of alcohol whatsoever.
O:  Overall, this is one of my favorite examples of the style.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this beauty up and tasted such a well balanced imperial stout.  This beer is well deserving of it's high marks, I'd highly recommend heading over to the brewery and picking some up. 1,225 charactersmavbrew, Nov 02, 2014

4.92/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Growler thanks to Rich, poured into Side Project Snifter and shared amongst 3 others.
A - Dark as night, this growler is roughly 1 month old yet held it's carbonation perfectly. 1/2 inch mocha foam head that slowly recedes back into the glass. Swirling gives more head and some lacing on the glass.
S - Smell is a bit of roasted coffee, maple, chocolate, and vanilla here. The maple smell doesn't come out as much until this warms up. Stirring and shaking it up brings more of the maple out behind the coffee smells
T - Taste follows the nose here with a blast of coffee, chocolate, followed by the sweet smooth taste of maple syrup. You really have to let this warm to appreciate all of the flavors. The blend between the maple coffee and chocolate is perfect here. 
M - Mouthfeel is not quite as heavy and thick as Mornin' Delight, but it is nice smooth and medium-thick bodied that coats the mouth well.
O - Overall, this is close to morning delight, a notch below. The flavors don't really show themselves until it gets closer to room temp. Suggest to let this sit out for a while before you can really appreciate the nuances. Mornin Delight wins on mouthfeel and flavors, much more pronounced maple, either way this is a world class beer and deserved of it's rating. 
Thanks Rich. Seek this one out with confidence.
Batch 2? or the more recent batch. Growler filled Nov 1st and consumer Nov 21st.
Still beautifully carbonated, the smell and taste on this batch have forced me to up my score to equal out with Mornin' Delight.
This batch has a more coffee forward presence with sweeter maple finish. Fuller body, just an overall improvement from the first batch that I had. 
With the ease of obtainment and how good it is. Seek this one out over MD. Sorry MD, but you can move on over, this takes the cake as the best non-barrel aged stout out there. Looking forward to seeing how much more they can improve the recipe. 1,933 charactersdrmcleod10, Oct 16, 2014

Fudge. All aspects of the nose are very rich. Really impressed with how well the maple stands out in the nose. Flavor is also very entertaining. Maple syrup, brownies and fudge, coffee liqueur, bitter espresso and a surprising earthy hop note. Dark chocolate and vanilla. Body is oily and syrupy. Softer carbonation. Sticky, lingering feel with respectable bitterness. Alcohol is smothered by the flavors. This turned out to be a really great beer. Tree House does their dark beers with equal precision to their more attention grabbing hoppy beers.

Thick creamy darker mocha colored 1/2 finger head, super pitch black long long legs. 
Nose can be smelled from a few feet away, so much amazing fresh roasted coffee, fresh roasted and ground espresso beans, roasted malt, faint cocoa dust, then big maple creams, fresh maple cream candy with caramel creams as well, nice maple syrupy without going overboard, faint molasses, etc. Touch nutty 
Taste sweet maple cream, big maple candy, caramel creams, etc. So much light airy choc cake, cocoa and dark choc all over, faint faint roast and black malt. Then coffee, fresh roasted coffee, nutty slight earthy coffee ava fresh roasted espresso, mild bitter roasted tannic coffee. Juicy fresh maple cream coffee and little bitter note. Finish is bitter dry, loaded with coffee and maple cream, more caramel and choc, almost fudgey but not quite that heavy. 
Mouth full bod, booze hidden well, nice fluffy carb, thick fudgey like.

4.95/5  rDev +3.8%This was suppose to be an Imperial Double Shot, but it became something else. Something greater.
Pours a really dark amber with about  half a finger head. Head is creamy with some really nice lacing. 
The smell of this beer blew me away. Huge notes of Maple and Vanilla assault my nose. really great notes of fudge chocolate with coffee bitterness surprisingly making the backseat, but making their presence still known.
Wow! Maple and Vanilla sweetness getting a hold of my tongue.  Once you think this beer will be completely sweet, the cocoa and coffee bitterness comes trough. Completely giving you a well balance Imperial Coffee Stout. What a dense beer, but in a good way.
Absolutely spectacular mouthfeel. Thick, creamy, rich, and chewy. Just what I love in a non BA Imperial Stout.
Overall, this became my favorite non BA Imperial Stout of all time. The real Maple syrup gave even more World Class status to this completely different version of Double Shot. Nose,Taste,Mouthfeel you name it, the Maple is king in this beer. The fact the sweetness of the Maple and Vanilla didn't overpower the beer and yet made it the most important factor, it makes this beer special.

Enjoyed over brunch with my girlfriend out of Tree house Teku glassware. Not our first rodeo with this beer.
Nose-Brownie Crust- roasted notes and rich chocolate smells blend. Breathing deeper adds some maple syrup to the mix, and a small vanilla wafer smell.  Some coffee beans on the tail end, with more coffee presence as this baby warms.
Look-Molasses head with a small light biscuit colored ring, rich dark brown near black beer as thick as can be.  Some large and some small bubbles that stick around and look like chunky real hot chocolate foam. Light legs. Mixed light and dark spots on the foam.
Mouthfeel-This is where the beer excels- it is the most luscious mouthfeel of any beer I have ever had. Similar to some good bottles of Birth of Tragedy-creamy, rich, thick, like a light chocolate shake.  Coats the tongue. 
Taste- progression starts with sweet marsh-mellow flavor, with some vanilla bean aspects. Quickly some coffee flavor, which starts like an over roasted black coffee and then tastes sweetened with cream somehow. As the flavor closes, a real cocoa chocolate flavor comes on that when combined with the light alcohol presence almost tastes like cinnamon or spice of some kind.
  General consensus is this would crush barrel aged, although I don't necessarily see a ton of room for improvement. The beer works so well and is an amazing treat.  Needs to be bottled so that I can break this out during a snowstorm.
Edit:  Did drink this during a snowfall, it did rule. 1,594 charactersGuzzle_McBrew, Sep 13, 2014

Smell is like walking into a great donut shop on a Sunday morning.  I've never smelled a beer that was more inviting than this.

4.74/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Picked up a growler of this about an hour ago from the brewery. This is the latest double shot variant. Double Double Shot with VT beans and local maple syrup.  Poured into my Duvel tulip.
A - Pours a nice dark dark brown nearly black hue with a pillowing three finger darker mocha head that fades nice and slowly to leave spotty side lacing and a nice creamy blanket. Really solid appearance here with a lovely billowy mocha head. 4.5 (x .05 = .225)
S - Aromas just assault the nose here. Enormous maple assault, not cloyingly sweet mind you just that rich rich maple cream candy aroma. The chocolate is there, not quite fudgy, more cake like. Actually, its more like chocolate drizzled over some maple candies. Not assertive, but in balance and harmony. The same can be said about the coffee. The maple definitely muscles its way front and center, the coffee popping up deeper in the aroma with more roasted bean note than a fresh cup. There are nice vanilla notes and some maple sugar as well. Maple really is the shining star here and the stout is a perfect vessel. 4.75 (x .2 = .95)
T - Taste is a shining similarity to the nose. The maple syrup is a bit sweeter than the nose but it reminds you that they used real maple syrup and not just a dash of it. The chocolate is much more rich here too, like brownies swirled with maple. Rich dark chocolate lingers as well, intermixed with the maple. Much more dense rich brownie batter like than a fluffy cake. Light vanilla, and the coffee lends more of a roasted lightly bitter grounds note. Once again, the maple in this beer really shines and transforms this in to something special. Dean said "Pour it on your pancakes!" and I can completely see that. The taste is not overly sweet by any means, it is incredibly decadent though. 4.75 (x .45 = 2.138)
M - Mouthfeel is thicker, creamy, nice chew to it. Beefing up Double Shot really helped the beer out, as I think using regular Double Shot might have not been chewy enough or even thin. This though is quite nice. Alcohol hidden very nicely though it does creep up. Quite silky and chewy. It is incredibly easy to drink. 4.75 (x .1 = .475)
O - Overall this was hands down the best non IPA beer that's come out of Tree House in my opinion. Best Double Shot variant here for me thanks to how much that maple translates over. The maple assault on the nose and pallet is just shocking. The maple level here is right up with Funky Buddha's French Toast for me in regards to potency and execution. It's really nitpicking here to find flaws in the beer, and even the flaws are more based on personal preference than knocks against the beer. Really hope they do a barrel aged version of this, if only so Dean could shout "Good Morning Wood!" to the customers as they enter the building. 4.75 (x .2 = .95)
