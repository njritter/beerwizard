L: 2F head with pretty good retention. Leaves spotty lacing and a little bit of a cap and ring. Beer is a hazy pale golden.
S: Pineapple and orange, other tropical fruits. Light malts. Decent amount of earthiness on back end.
T: Pineapple and orange up front, with more exotic fruits like kiwi and passionfruit. Light malt in the middle and a fair amount of earthiness in a slightly bitter finish.
F: Light to medium body, light carbonation. Very good construction and balance.
O: Another in a long line of great Trillium DIPAs. 592 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Apr 30, 2017

T - muscadine, odd tropical, slightly sweet, a moderate bitterness you feel more than you taste, clean dry finish
F - medium plus thickness and carb, slight burn

A very cloudy pale color.  After pouring it in a glass i was expecting a wheat or flavor infused brew but I was pleasantly surprised  buy the taste. 
Medium body and perfect carbonation.  I would say it is the best ale i have had from a can.
Worth the taste looking forward to m next from this brewer. 314 charactersTeachChefs, Apr 29, 2017

A - Hazy  orange gold with a finger of thin fizzy white head, no lacing.
S - Huge juicy citrus hops, lots of orange and grapefruit, pine, pineapple, papaya, then some nice floral notes as well, very bright but intense.
T - Big bold hop profile here, earthy and spicy hop resin, big citrus bite with some juicy tropical note in the background, very light malt base, big bitterness that isnt over the top.
M - A full and balanced feel of bitterness and body
O - So far Id say this is the best IPA Ive had from Trillium yet. 544 charactersOmnium, Apr 27, 2017

Smell: Pungent pineapple, mango, and fresh cut grass. Sticky on the nose. A bit boozy. 
Taste: Tangerine, mango, bitter pine, grassy notes, and bitter citrus pith. Reminds me of a mango smoothie. 
Feel: Soft carbonation. Medium bodied. Prickly bitterness on the bone dry finish. Moderate alcohol warmth. 
Overall: Another juicy New England style IPA from Trillium. This one is set apart with a a more pronounced alcohol and bitterness making it more akin to a typical double IPA. Really enjoyed this one. 570 charactersBergBeer, Apr 17, 2017

4.07/5  rDev -8.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Cloudy like all Trillium unfiltered beers. The color is dirty gold. Modest head which settles to the finest film of bubbles. There's a few spots for lace. 
The smell is complex with a bit of bubblegum, berry fruitiness, and mild flowery hop. Attractive ask and inviting. 
A smooth DIPA with a solid malt base. The dominates but doesn't mask the base. The beer is rich with an above average carbonation level. The finish is peppery and oddly refreshing (crisp) given the style. The aftertaste is not exclusively bitter; I get light berry sweetness as well. 557 characterssmcolw, Apr 15, 2017

Mostly yellow in color, the look isn't sexy, its muddled, clarity is nowhere to be found.  Very thin 1/6" white head.  Aroma wasn't dropping the Nelson hop.  Some citra/mosaic/galaxy, but the others didn't come across.
Wow, super light body, indicative of the wheat and pilsner barley.  Alcohol isn't covered up as much as you'd hope, but its still bursting with hops and has a very soft exterior to it, the malt is super light and non traditional, and the hops aren't bittering hops, well the Columbus can be, but they aren't huge here it seems.   Nice tropical fruit vibe throughout from the hops.  
Very good but ugly beer. 702 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 11, 2017

S: Nose consists of aromas of tropical fruit and citrus including melons, pineapple, mango, guava, orange, and grapefruit. Mild notes of piney and earthy hops.
T: Juicy hop bomb! Starts off with huge bitter notes of grapefruit, orange rind, and tangerine followed by milder notes of melons, guava, and pineapple. Leaves a piney, resinous, palate-smacking hop bitterness that lingers for a lengthy period of time.
F: Medium bodied. Smooth and crisp with moderate carbonation.
O: Overall, this is a great DIPA. Huge hazy hop bomb! Well balanced. Would definitely seek this one out again. 794 charactersBeerGuy8315, Feb 24, 2017

A: An opaque orange juice color with a bit of off white head that fizzles out to basically nothing.  No lacing, no retention. 
S: Ripe mango, creamy tangerine, candy lifesavers.  Kind of a galaxy/mosaic thing going on.  
T: Orange with a decent amount of citrus bite, a bit of tropical fruit (mango), finishing with soft bitterness and sweetness.  There’s also some yeast-derived astringency/grittiness on the finish.  Not quite as flavorful as I’ve come to expect from Trillium.
M: Medium-full body, creamy texture, with a sharp medium-light carbonation that cuts through the body.  A bit of alcohol taste and warmth.
O: Better nose than taste, this is middle of the road for Trillium IPAs. 735 characterspmarlowe, Feb 23, 2017

A hazy orangish to golden color with about two fingers of head. Not much lacing for so much head. 
You can smell all the tropical fruits from a distance. Orange, grapefruit, and a little lemon. 
The taste does have fruity tones but it fades to something more bitter. The alcohol is well hidden in the fruits. 
A dry sort of taste with a medium-heavy body. Very smooth. 
Overall a solid DIPA with great fruits for an awesome taste and better smell.

4.54/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Canned 10/4/16, pours extremely cloudy orange color with a 1 finger foamy off white head that was full of tiny bubbles and faded very, very slowly, leaving sticky lacing coating the sides as it eased down. The clarity was perfect New England style IPA with the cloudy orange looks.
Whoa, the tropical fruit hit my nose 6 inches from the glass...grapefruit, pineapple, orange peel, lemon, star fruit, mango, weed, fresh piney hops, biscuit, peppery spices, fresh cut flowers and/or fresh floral hops, and then a bready/cracker background that added some nice balance to the extremely fresh smelling citrus hops. Wonderful to inhale.
Tastes a lot like it smells with the intense citrus up front that includes grapefruit, pineapple, orange peel, lemon, star fruit, mango, clementine and every other citrus fruit you can imagine. It's dank and bitter at the same time with additions of zesty piney hops, peppery spices with a mix of white pepper, coriander and light cumin, and then flowers, pungent floral hops and a smooth finish like oats were used as part of the sturdy malt backbone. Nice amount of biscuit, graham cracker and toasted grain notes along with a touch of honey or something equally sweet. Really damn tasty.
Mouthfeel is smooth with light carbonation, a medium to chewy body which has texture, and a clean finish that seems to dry up after the bitterness starts to fade from the citrus assault. Much easier to drink than an 8% ABV DIPA should be.
Overall a great DIPA, it lived up to the hype. Thanks to 'Boccu' and Marcus for hooking me up with this can! 1,574 charactersCHickman, Oct 22, 2016

Pours a well hazed orange-gold with a scant finger of short-lived head, minimal lacing.
Smells of oranges, melons and crackers, weeds and sweat.
Taste is grapefruit juice, grapefruit pith, cantaloupe, grape, lime, bread roll and peppery spice.  Finishes with an unexpected hint of cane sugar, a long, lingering hop burn to the tongue, and a warming alcohol burn in the gullet
Feel is smooth, medium-heavy bodied, adequately carbonated and semi-dry.
Overall, as usual, an excellent DIPA. If I had to find fault (and, apparently, I do), I think it's perhaps not the most fortuitous blending of hop varieties and the alcohol presence actually manages to feel bigger than its stated 8%. That said, I drank the whole damn can with gusto and I'd do it again. 824 characterspapposilenus, Oct 19, 2016

Pours murky gold with a thin, short-lived head. Minimal lacing or retention.
Aromatics blast off with plenty of pungent hops. Candied grapefruit, resinous weed, pithy pineapple, and tropical fruit. Medium bodied and tacky. Carbonation on the lowish side. A carpet of hops on the palate with a nice combo of dank and tropical, and a hint of pine running under. Very dry with zero malt.
Finishes with lingering earthy, resinous hops and very dank. 
Great IIPA. Nice hops all around and dry enough to keep the beer extremely drinkable. 557 charactersbrewandbbq, Oct 18, 2016

Smell is dank fruit, I get peach and melon with a bit of pepper. The flavor adds citrus to the peach and melon with all that followed by some floral peppery bitter finish. This is a smooth Double IPA with a crisp finish. It's a little different than other Trillium IPA's I've had but just as good. I love the balance between ripe fruit and spicy bitterness. The feel is not as juicy as their others as the description says but fits the flavor profile. 531 charactersMeyers1023, Oct 13, 2016

Smell has notes of orange, cantaloupe, and a ton of dank mosaic hops. One of the purest dank smelling beers I've had. Tons of weed with a citrus undertone. I'm not a huge fan of overly dank smelling beers, but the aromas on this are quite pungent and crisp. 
Taste is very fruity initially with lots of peach, mango, and orange. Gives way to a more dank flavor showcasing the mosaic hops. The finish then is almost spicy and the nelson hoops provide a white wine like flavor. Touch of hoppy bitterness on the finish. Really nice array of flavors that plays together quite well. 
Feel is incredibly smooth with a thick mouthfeel. Medium carbonation, just a really nice DIPA. So drinkable and it hides the ABV incredibly well. 
Overall a lovely DIPA. 893 charactersFBarber, Oct 12, 2016

4.45/5  rDev 0%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Canned 10/4/16. Consumed 10/10/16.
A: Beer comes in a medium gold color with medium-plus haze. About a finger of fluffy white head forms as it pours, bit it dissipates rapidly and fades to a thin ring of tiny bubbles within a minute. Not too much lacing on the glass.
S: Intensely aromatic. A true medley of tropical fruit, with pineapple, mango, blueberry, and peach at the forefront. There's a musty, overripe, almost rotten fruit character as well as an underlying dusty, earthy white grape note from the Nelson. I'd say that the Galaxy and Mosaic definitely dominate the aroma while the Nelson plays a very nice supporting role. 
T: Follows the nose, but with a few additional and potent notes. I get a lot more citrus (sweet orange, grapefruit) up front; in fact, the citrus is actually the dominant flavor throughout the taste. Tropical fruits are still there, but much more restrained. Pineapple, mango, blueberry for sure. On the backend, that Nelson-y grape flavor really comes out, but it's a sweeter grape flavor than I'm used to from Nelson. The finish isn't nearly as dry as other Nelson-hopped beers I've had recently. The sweetness of the fruit flavors really carries through and makes for an incredibly balanced and satisfying aftertaste.
M: Medium-plus weight on the tongue with a really nice balance of bitterness and sweetness. There's a lingering sticky, almost candied dried fruit sweetness that coats the mouth, but the medium bitterness and white-wine-esque dryness keeps it far from being cloying. It's incredibly smooth for the ABV with a very textured (slightly chalky) yet still quite juicy feel. Not quite creamy, but very close.
O: This is a really good DIPA and an excellent showcase of three of my favorite hops. The aroma on this is HUGE, one of the most pungent and explosive that I've experienced in a while. The aromatic profile is rich and tropical with an perfect earthiness to complement the sweet, almost candied fruit notes. The flavor follows suit, but is less diverse and more heavily citric. As the beer warmed, I got a bit more alcohol on the taste and a slightly 'fusel' nail polish-y flavor, which was a bit unpleasant. It wasn't overpowering at all, but I definitely preferred this when it was cold vs. near cellar temp. Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA and one of my favorite Trillium beers yet. 2,349 charactersavas, Oct 11, 2016

The beer pours a bright golden color, apricot and orange hues, hazy and cloudy with a foamy white head, not super tall with little retention yet lots of lace. The aroma is super citrusy, juicy and crisp but also bitter and rindy with a lot of "green" overhop character, hop spice, grassiness, pale grain sweetness and some floral scents that linger. The flavors offer a really bitter hop bite, tons of juiciness as well, very sharp citrus flavors, almost a lime like crispness to it with that same overhopped "green" character, some sweetness to counterbalance the beer creeps out and again, a bit of wildflower lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is nice, medium body, coating, smooth, moderate carbonation with a dry finish.
Verdict: A nice double IPA from Trillium but easily overhopped and unbalanced. Very juicy, tangy, and refreshing, but a bit too bitter, a bit too green and one dimensional with the citrus. While still a nice beer, not quite up to the standard that Trillium usually achieves. 1,127 characterskevanb, Sep 24, 2016

Aroma is pink peppercorn, tangy, pungent hops, tropical and stone fruits, and cannabis. In the end it becomes a peaches and cream and strawberry cloud of heaven.  A touch of apple cider vinegar creeps in as it warms.

The aroma is cheesy hops to quite a dank character slight fruity with rind and pulp.
The taste is hoppy to the point of tasting like dirty melons - vegetative cantaloupe, grassy, weedy and with noticeable alcohol warmth.
This is medium in body and modestly carbonated. It seems as though bigger is not better with this brewery. Would pass on this in the future. 482 charactersstakem, Sep 02, 2016

Pours a hazy, golden color with a nice head that leaves prominent lacing. Doesn't have the same aroma that punches you in the face like some of the DDH Trillium beers, but still has nice aromas of tropical fruit and pine. Grapefruit is the main flavor, with underlying flavors of tropical fruits and pine.  Slight bitterness with some sticky hop resin. Very soft mouthfeel.

Smell: Big orange, a little peach or tropical like smell
Taste: Tangerine, orange, starts lightly sweet, but ends with a nice pleasant bitterness that lasts, slight citrus finish, with a very sligh alcohol flavor, as it warms some resin ad hop spiciness come through
Feel: creamy like mouthfeel, leaves resiny like coating on the tongue.  Very drinkable
Overall: A tropical hop flavored beer, that is lacking some complexity to make it outstanding. 500 characterslic217, Aug 17, 2016

Pours solid dark gold orange amber with a creamy frothy white foam head. Smells ridiculously dank and tropical with gigantic mangos, peach, orange, guava, grapefruit, passionfruit, papaya, some onion, bready malt, with super dank earthy green pine and herbal grass. Tastes super dank and fruity with mango, peach, orange, guava, passionfruit, papaya, grapefruit, some bready malt, with spicy dank green earthy pine and herbal grass. Feels so juicy, smooth, creamy medium bodied with a soft, enticingly low tingly carbonation. Overall, one of the dankest, juiciest, and best DIPA and beers I've ever had. Trillium never ceases to amaze me. Really great beer! 684 charactersStoutElk_92, Aug 11, 2016

The aroma on this beer is great per usual for trillium. The taste follows the nose, but really missing some bitterness and/or maltiness.  Other than the citrus, mango, and fruity perceived taste, not much else there. It drinks a tad thin and there is no lingering mouthfeel. 373 charactershardysf, Mar 04, 2016

Hazy, murky, cloudy yellowish orange.   Immediately smells of mellow citrus, grapefruit, mango, strong peach, subtle orange, sweet melon and gentle hops.   The taste is a pure juice- peach and mango dominate and yet the beer is so complete.  Amazing mouthfeel, very complex and decently thick for a dipa.  If you are into fruit bombs, you honestly can't do much better than this. 476 charactersDavid_Porter, Feb 24, 2016

While overall the flavor and tone of this beer is classic trillium, it came in a little hot to me, boozy. My girlfriend thought this was my homebrew. It has the flavor of being fermented at a higher temp than recommended for English ale yeast (assuming thats what they use). Still great, but not the best 386 charactersTommo, Feb 23, 2016

4.14/5  rDev -7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz bottle purchased at the Congress Street location. Extremely turbid and cloudy, more yellow than orange. Aroma is fantastic, reminds me of a mimosa or maybe just orange juice, extremely juicy. The flavor is also nice and citrus juicy but also alcohol. This is a great beer don;t get me wrong but I think i preferred their pale ale and IPA. Both were just as juicy without the wallop of alcohol and the much higher price tag. 428 charactersArrogantB, Feb 04, 2016

Pours out that hazy, turbid, opaque pineapple juice look of the NE hoppy beers.
Aroma explodes with white grape/white wine from the Nelson hops followed by juicy tropical fruit notes of mango, pineapple and orange. Touch of dankness too.
Flavor up front is dominated by the white grape of the Nelson Sauvin hops, but is quickly followed by juicy pineapple, orange/tangerine, peach, mango and apricot of the Mosaic hops. Finish is more spicy and has notes of resin and light pine along with dankness and a slight herbal character. Very juicy, but has enough bitterness to make it more drinkable.
Medium bodied with a slightly thinner mouthfeel and completely hidden alcohol! Too drinkable!
Overall, just another amazing beer! Trillium is making some of my new favorite beers. Now if I could just have this in the fridge all the time..... 895 charactersJohnnyMc, Feb 03, 2016

A: Murky / almost turbid appearance. Typical yellowish color. Heads leaves quickly to just a paper thin cap. This is gonna be another juice bomb from Trill and I can't F'n wait !!
S: As I cracked the cap on this, once again there was a citrusy hop slap in my grill. There's pinnapple, a touch of peach, or maybe orange. I could smell this and the DDH Sclaled All damn day!
T : Juice Bommmmbs away ! Lol these guys are REDICULOUSLY on pointe. So I get pinnapple for sure, some orange or peach. Dank weed, and just a touch of smooth sweet malts toward the ass end. 
F : A nice clean, slightly thin feel as you swallow. With a nice hop bitterness bite that doesn't linger very long.
O: From what I hear batch 1 was decent, but this batch has been tweaked, and it's glorious. I compare this to their recently release Double Dry Hopped Scaled. It's got more booze, but that's what it reminds me of. So if you haven't had any of Trilliums offerings, I urge you to pick some up, your scences will thank you ! Bravo Trillium Crew, keep kicking ass.

Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for sharing this beer
A: Medium tangerine in color with some honey and gold around the edges - decidedly hazy and straight-up turbid - pours with a medium sized, white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves some streaks of lacing
S: Stupid, stupid amounts of hops - first off, this is stupidly dank - extremely resinous and extremely dank, straight-up weed - some bright citrus with sharp orange and grapefruit - yes, this is a juice bomb, with lots of tropical aromas - pineapple, mango, and melon - some pine and hits of mint as well - some pale malts underneath the weedy, resinous juice explosion
T: About as absurd as it smells - an atomic hop bomb, a true Trillium IPA - super, super juicy with orange, tangerine, and grapefruit juice - some floral citrus as well and a touch of pith - resinous and sticky pine, hop cones, and weed - tropical notes, including sticky pineapple, mango, melon, and a touch of passion fruit - so, so juicy - some herbal notes and mint - pale malts, but they don't matter
M: Medium body, chewy (or "fuzzy,"  as some describe New England IPAs), medium carbonation, lingering hoppy finish
O: The fact that this is basically an experiment is what makes this hilarious
As anyone in the Boston area knows, Trillium is awesome. This DIPA is no exception. I had some of this about a month ago (which I believe was batch 1), and it was good. This is even better. And by that, I mean it's absurd. 1,466 charactersangrybabboon, Jan 30, 2016
4.6/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Dammit, how do they do it?  The look is a slighty-slighty hazy orange/nectarine with big foam but not the thick typical Trillium foamy look. Aroma is ridiculously amazing, as expected.  The mosaic shines and mango/galaxy juice pours into the nostrils.  Its stupid good, for some reason I keep thinking nectarine/peachy juice - one of my favorite noses.  Taste is on point tons of straight juice, less danky and more resin but still smooth as hell.  Mouthfeel is a thinner than most of their other big abv imperial ipas.. wouldn't describe this as pillowy but more hop forward and in your face.  Still  an awesome beer. 618 charactersM_chav, Jan 30, 2016

4.81/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I'm from CT, relatively close to NEBCO, so I've been fortunate to have the hoppy stuff those guys crank out for as long as I can remember.  
Trillium had become a consistent stop on trips up to Boston, and brews like this are why.  I know Julius gets a ton of hype, and it's a great beer, but to me Scaled Up does the best, most balanced juice bomb I've tasted.
Scaled Up is right in line with Julius & Sip of Sunshine,with some additional tropical hop dankness the other two don't seem to present as much.
As with most Trillium brews I've had, drink this one fresh. I try to within a week to week and a half of acquiring.  Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the maltiness really comes out in a relatively short amount of time with trilliums hop bombs.
I mean,my god, think about how many great breweries are putting out just super tasty hoppy stuff in the northeast right now.  Trillium is right up there. 911 charactersZella2010, Jan 22, 2016

A- 750ml into dual tulips with a fairly hazy golden-orange body and a pinky high frothy, thick white cap. Good head retention as it dies eventually to a wide ring and lacing starts as thick sheets. Drizzled patches decorate most of the glass.
S- Tropical and stone fruit nectars with some citrus, pine and floral beyond that. Juicy mango, papaya, peach, cantaloupe and melons along with slight orange and grapefruit. Even by today's standards very clean for 8% ABV as the hops are the sole act.
T- Rides on the waves of the aroma with plentiful notes of peach, mango, apricot and papaya; the same tropical stone fruit juiciness. Gains some more hop complexity with bitter orange peel and grapefruit pith more noticeable. Also supremely dank in the flavor with more melon and sticky herbs coming to mind. Slightly sweet with a whisper of cereal.
MF- Puffy and creamy body with just a touch of chew to it. Silky wheat smoothness. Overall it is towards the thick end of the spectrum and it finishes with a dank herbal bitterness lingering on the palate. Like the fluffiest most comfortable blanket you can imagine.
While it seems nowadays like you can go anywhere around New England and find a great IPA, Trillium certainly has risen up there with the best of them and their signature is all over this one. Even with hundreds of good IPAs on the market around 8% this one really does drink like a true juice; didn't miss a beat at Canton, perhaps even better! 1,497 characterscbutova, Jan 22, 2016

4.28/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. Pours like your standard Trillium smoothie. Turbid as it gets. Thin white crown. Aroma is that Trillium hop milk I have had many a time before. Just a concentrated mix of several tropical fruits. You got your pineapple and apricot and guava and nectarine and 33 different types of citrus fruit. A bit of earthiness. Dank and Nelsony in a lighter regard. Sweet glazed doughnut malt. Flavor is sweet, juicy, fruity hop ooze. Not high on bitterness as far as Imperial IPAs generally go. Big feel; very creamy and textured. Like an Imperial Stout on the tongue. If I am in the mood for Trillium hop sludge, this one will suffice like any and all of their Pale Ales, IPAs & Imperial IPAs. Looks like the character of beer is staying true to their form down in Canton. 770 charactersVelvetExtract, Jan 21, 2016

Aroma is big pineapple, mango, citrus, with a bit of dank resin.
Flavor is peach and apricot, with some tropical fruit and slightly piney finish.
Much lighter beer than I anticipated, moderate bitterness. Silky, not chewy.
Lighter bodied than most other Trillium IPAs, but very much in the pre-expansion house character in all other ways. 396 characterstrevorpost, Jan 17, 2016

A great offering from a great brewery! 306 characters-Rick, Jan 17, 2016

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy yellow color with no vision of anything.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:Tropical, piney, herbal, spicy, and grassy hops followed by biscuity, wheaty, caramel, and toasted 
Taste:  Same as above.  Nice hoppynotes, balanced malt bill, chewiness, yeasty notes, and light bitterness. 
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, a bit chewy, yeasty, medium bodied, medium carbonation, light bitterness, and tasty.
Overall:  Nice hop flavor.  A little yeasty and chewy notes would makes this beer better. 640 charactersFlounder57, Jan 16, 2016

Haze bomb. Yellow with and almost brown core - slippery quick head dissipates quickly. 
Smell is almost too hop forward - a bit more malt could reign in the extreme bouquet of dank, peach, and citrus. A little pine in there too. 
Taste is fantastic. I mean, all flavors are intense and rather bitter for a trillium beer, just like the single version of scaled. Sweeter notes of peaches, orange, grapefruit, and spiciness hit the palette hard before bitter aspect of the hops come in with notes of grass, pine, and earthiness. Leaves a dank linger. 
This is a light dipa, but the pure hoppy thickness of this beers makes it heavier than the abv would suggest. 
This beer is so hoppy, I would have found it unimaginable only a few years ago. Now it is just another outstanding offering from trillium. 875 characterssoze47, Jan 16, 2016

4.4/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Picked up a growler at the new Canton facility. Heard the first batch of Scaled Up was good but didn't have the house characteristics (read: super wet dank haze) Trillium is known for. After trying a sample of the second batch, I knew this was a different beer. Poured like OJ concentrate with a nice pillowy head. Smelled amazing, like boozy fruit juice. Taste was that of a classic New England IPA....juice blanket.  Perfect carbonation. My only gripe would be the booziness and my lack of self control. 505 characterspatrickcmcd, Jan 16, 2016

Pours a hazy orange yellow color with a thin white head that leaves blotches of lacing around the glass. Smell is loads of pineapple and mango, with some citrus. Taste is full of pineapple and mango. Sweet malt helps elevate those tropical fruit notes. Bitterness is there but only slightly. Helps with the grapefruit in the back end. There's some dankness in there too. Alcohol is barely noticable. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. That signature Trillium feel. Kinda sticky though and carbonation is kinda low. Overall, an amazing DIPA. Trillium really knows what they're doing with hops. 652 charactersMisSigsFan, Jan 16, 2016

Looks like orange juice. Smells like glorious bready malt and citrus. Tastes like grapefruit, mango, orange and peach with a slight hop bitterness on the back end. I had to check the label again to make sure it said 8% as there is no hint of it being a high abv.  Mouthfeel is fluffy like a morning OJ with medium in carbonation and body. Reminds me of OJ and sprite I had as a child but better tasting and with an alcoholic kick. 
Impressive is probably putting this beer lightly. This beer is  superb. 539 charactersbeantown_hopster, Jan 15, 2016

A: The beer is a very cloudy yellowish gold color, with a thin off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains a lot of floral hops and fruity citrus along with caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out bready with a hearty malt character up front. Then a strong grassy hops bitterness comes in. Then there’s some sweetness from flavors of fruity citrus and caramel creating a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice 2IPA to drink for a long time. 846 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jan 12, 2016

It looks like a cloud saturated with peach juice ready to rain. Only problem is zero head retention. Wide array of citrus peel in the smell. A mix of orange and grapefruit juice in the smell as well. Grapefruit forward with a bit of dank pine. Feel is fresh squeezed juice for days. Great beer. 366 charactersHootie159, Jan 09, 2016
4.18/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours an extremely murky bright orange color with a 1 finger white head. The head is gone quickly but there's some good lacing. 
The aroma has plenty of orange and melon, with some more subtle notes of grass and pine. There's also a faint, peppery malt character present. 
The taste is very sweet up front. I get orange, melon, and tangerine, as well as a bit of peach. The middle hides some bitter piney notes, but the end follows up with more candied-orange sweetness. A nice, fruity flavor, but a bit too much on the sweet side. 
The feel is very creamy and smooth, with relatively low carbonation. A tad dry, but quite refreshing. Alcohol is very well hidden. 
Overall, a very good DIPA that falls a bit short of other Trillium offerings. The tropical, juicy sweetness that defines a great New England IPA is very much present here, but there isn't much else to balance it out. The flavors are very good, but just a bit too sweet for my tastes. That said, I still enjoyed it quite a bit. 995 charactersScaryEd, Jan 09, 2016

Aroma:  Pine, faint melon. 
Taste: sugary melon, lots of pine, some earthy tones and residual sugar. There's definitely some herbal notes going on that I wish weren't there, not that they're terrible. 
Mouthfeel is fine, low carb but not deficient. 
Overall - For Trillium this is just OK. But ignoring that it's Trillium, this is a fairly solid DIPA. However, but the value isn't great once I realized what I paid for it. It's roughly the same quality to me as a fresh can of Larry, but much, much more expensive so I'd likely never buy it again. When I get the chance to occasionally splurge and spend my hard earned money on Trillium, I expect much more given what I know they can do, so this left me disappointed overall even though the beer is solid. 809 charactersjbertsch, Jan 08, 2016

12/17/15
Served in a snifter
Hazy golden amber appearance. Slightly short of cloudy. The liquid was topped by a fluffy, finger tall crown of white froth that quickly fell to a thin film of bubbles. Streaks of drippy lacing trickled along the glass.
The aroma was initially pure orange juice. Candied orange peel later came through as well. Super fruity. Fairly sweet. The complexities grew with time. Tropical fruit notes came forth. Lots of musty passionfruit. Mango was noticeable. Hint of guava. There was a dank, weed-like quality. Super fragrant.
The flavor profile was also amazingly hoppy and fruity but a bit more simplistic than the nose. Orange juice notes dominated. Loads of tangerine as well. Super peachy. Fairly sweet up front. Good dose of candied orange peel. Sweetened grapefruit appeared on the back end and in the finish. Bit of pineyness. Mango was noticeable as the beer warmed. Quite sweet overall but really smooth and quaffable.
The mouthfeel was creamy, slick and smooth. Medium-light for the style. The liquid contained a fine, zippy effervescence. Frothy and fluffy on the palate.
While Scaled Up may not be Trillium's best double IPA, it is incredibly enjoyable and dangerously drinkable. With a bit less sweetness and more complexity in the flavor profile, this could be spectacular. 1,408 charactersDamian, Jan 03, 2016

However I just had one from a new batch pours a beautiful cloudy yellow smells of tons of citrus fruits. Taste follows the nose lots of citrus and hops on the end.
One of my top 5 trillium beers now. 327 charactersGinjaSlice, Dec 28, 2015
4.2/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4750ml bottle served in a tulip.  Pours a dub orange with a slight haze to the clarity and a half-inch, frothy, bright white head.  Great nose - bright citrus fruit notes, rind and a hint of spice.  Taste consistent with nose - tangerines, rind and a kiss of an earthy/herbal quality to add some complexity.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a pleasant, even carbonation and a kiss of acidity.  Overall, another solid DIPA from Trillium.  Not my favorite simply because they have so many outstanding offering; however, really fresh and quaffable. 573 charactersJwale73, Dec 27, 2015

Flavor is sweet and bitter, hoppy and smooth.  Quite smooth.  Spiciness and hoppiness stand out the most here.  Citrus still present, but dominated by the rest of the flavors.  Alcohol is well hidden.  Overall, really nice - but their more citrus-forward IPA's I personally prefer. 374 charactersanteatr23, Dec 25, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A moderately aggressive pour yields a slightly hazy golden orange brew with 2 fingers of rocky white head with good retention that leaves moderate lacing. Aroma is peach, pineapple, grapefruit, a bit of pale malt, and a whiff of alcohol. Taste follows the nose, fairly juicy upfrobt. Dank with peach and pineapple upfront, more subdued mango and citrus, a touch of pale malt. A moderate bitterness; finishes fairly dry. Medium body and carbonation. It is probably 85% of the haze that I expect from Trillium but has all of the juiciness. It really seems that they have dailed in the new facility at Canton as this beer is excellent. 632 charactersmnj21655, Dec 23, 2015

Pours a pretty hazy body with a big white frothy head that reduces slowly to leave heavy blotchy lacing and chunky retention, looks really nice. 
Aromas are very dank and citrusy, floral, grapefruit. On the tongue is crisp citrus and grapefruit, followed by some resinous dank notes, slight pine, finishes with a light bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium body and medium carbonation. 
A really nice DIPA. Super flavorful and balanced, on the citrusy / floral side. Enjoyed. 552 charactersgcamparone, Dec 23, 2015

Juicy.  Medium to full body. Medium carb.
Doesn't get much better from Trillium. 424 charactersAirBob, Dec 21, 2015

First time trying anythin from trillium, so I was hoping the hype was real.
Look: beautiful pour with a cloudy orange creamy looking beer.
Smell: I get peach, little bit of pineapple, a bit of pale malt in the background, but overall a great smelling beer.
Taste: similar to the smell, peach smacks you in the face, in the best way. I get a robust but slight pineapple taste, also a balanced pale malt in the back end.
Feel: My taste buds are to busy taking sip after sip. I get a creamy texture, and also a sticky feeling on the back of my throat. Very addictive beer. Take your time 
But overall for my first trillium beer, I'm very impressed, and can't wait to try the other beers I purchased. 739 charactersBeergasm1, Dec 20, 2015

Great smell, pineapple, pine, a little banana?   whipped cream head with fairly small bubbles that fall away.  Orange and hazy.  Good bubbly mouthfeel, not a ton of body.  Tastes of pine, a little maltier than many American doubles, some apricot, a little smoky and some peppery heat to end things.  Almost has a whisky finish.  Great, great stuff. 384 charactersSmokee, Dec 20, 2015

L - Hazy golden orange in color. Not quite a hop milkshake but pretty cloudy.
A - Tons of sweet, tropical aromas. Galaxy is very present here. Smells amazing.
T - Very similar to the aroma....galaxy is up front and center upon first sip...little bit of sweetness that fades into some nice hop bitterness. 
M - As a good double IPA should be. Flavors linger...sticky hoppiness.
O - Another stellar beer from Trillium. Not sure how they do it but their hop game is so on point. 538 charactersRAlmeida77, Dec 18, 2015
