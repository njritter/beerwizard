L: Amber honey color with huge long lasting white head.
S: Dank pineapple and peach. Powerful and awesome.
T: So well balanced. It has the fruit from the smell balanced with a strong dose of malt sweetness. Hardly any bitterness on the front end, but as it warms I get a dank resiny hop on the back end. I normally hate mosaic hops, but I'll happily finish this bomber.
F: Moderate to strong carbonation, a bit thin for a DIPA.
O: I'm finishing a single hopped mosaic beer, the first I've ever not poured down the drain. It's that well done. 565 characterse_oly, May 26, 2017

Thin whisps of foam on the surface and around the rim of the glass.  Burnt orange body. Moderate haze, but with a respectable amount of clarity.  Spotty, layered lacing. 
Loads of citrus, grapefruit, and blueberry in the nose.  Sweet and resinous.  A reeled in dank quality. 
This is a bright, luscious mosaic hop assault.  Blueberry and grapefruit are dominant.  Lingering, assertive bitterness that makes the IBUs known. 
Creamy and perfectly soft. Moderate carbonation and on the fuller bodied side. Coats your entire palate. 594 charactersepyon396, May 18, 2017

Taste: follows the nose right upfront but not quite as intense you get tropical fruits pineapple and peach middle of the mouth the mosaic really comes through blueberry guava along with a big dankness onion garlic and a crackery malt sweetness lingers into the finish were you get some floral notes along with citrus zest and a mix of pine and grapefruit biterness. 
Feel: medium to full bodied with a nice
creaminess. The bitterness of the Hops
Linger on the sides of your tongue.
Overall: A really good use of mosaic in this beer. You get the blueberry and dankness you would excpect with an intense bitter finish. I prefer king Sue over this but would be happy to drink this anytime. 838 charactersMasonz223, May 12, 2017

Picked up at the KBBS release
A- pours a hazy golden-orange color with a two-finger creamy white head that has great retention, leaving some nice lacing behind
S- classic earthy/herbal mosaic aroma; zesty orange and grapefruit, garlic/onion, fresh cut grass, mango, pineapple, pine resin, fresh herbs, I could smell this all day
T- flavor opens with a big hit of grapefruit/tangerine zest, quickly followed by some tropical fruit notes of mango, peach, pineapple & guava.  Mid-palate adds some earthy notes of onion, fresh cut grass & pine.  The finish brings it all together with citrus peel, grass, mango, guava, peach & pine, absolutely delicious
M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into the finish, abv hidden well
O- as a fan of the mosaic hop, I really couldn't ask for more in a single hop IPA, outstanding 900 charactersTreyliff, Apr 01, 2017

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a light golden color. Initially cloudy but it clears up as the beer settles in the glass. Thick frothy head dissipates steadily leaving lots of white lacing on the glass. Lovely looking beer. 
Smell has notes of tropical fruits, pine, pineapple, grass, mango and peach. The fruit is there, but this isn't a "fruity" nose - the pine and dank grass is there just as much and it all blends together quite nicely. 
Taste follows the nose with notes of peach, pineapple, tropical fruits, grass, mango, pine, and sap. Mild bitter finish that doesn't overpower your taste buds. Touch of straw/grass on the finish with a lingering slightly sweet piney bitterness.  
Feel is remarkable first and foremost for how prickly and fizzy the carbonation it. I like a well carbonated IPA, but this is a tad much. Otherwise, its a super smooth dangerously drinkable DIPA. Refreshing is the word that comes to mind. 
Overall this is a lovely DIPA - definitely lived up to the hype for me and this bottle is a few months old. I'd love to have this one fresh sometime. 1,057 charactersFBarber, Mar 09, 2017

4.46/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This is a solid DIPA, probably due in part to my affinity for mosaic hops. Don't let my bias persuade you from trying, however. This is a world class beer, make no mistake about it. Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass.
This pours similar to the Pompeii, but a more straw-like color than a true amber body. Beautiful head & another huge nose; lots of earthy, green notes with plenty of citra to help balance. For a brewery that, IMO, puts out some of the best "noses" around, this one is up there.
If you're familiar with the Pompeii (you can check out my review of it), this is that on steroids. For the IBU this packs, it's incredibly well done. The bitterness is not overpowering and the malt backbone helps to keep some balance. Huge tangerine/orange notes with some nice grapefruit hints & some strong pine for bite & crispness. Finishes crisply without any lingering bitterness. 894 charactersumichfan, Feb 28, 2017

I am not a huge hop head, but this was surprisingly wonderful.
Dry, foamy, and bitter. I think the bitterness is amplified by how cracker-like this beer is. Smells of dank weed, pine sap, and tropical fruits. 283 charactersshareallthebeer, Feb 20, 2017

Smell is big dank weed up front, with a burst of pine sap, then pineapple, sticky peach, and lemon. Another powerful aroma bouquet by TG.
Taste is cracker, kiwi, pumpernickel, orange, wheat, and lime candy, with a hint of a sticky bowl of resin at the tail end.
This one was more bitter but also more frothy than the others we had this evening, finishing semi-dry.
Enjoyed this side by side with XHOPS Gold and DDH Sue, and it was a delight to experience how truly unique each beer was relative to each other. 605 charactersSabtos, Feb 06, 2017

Aroma jumps out of the glass with dank, juicy goodness. Big amounts of sweet tangerine, mango, and pineapple. A huge layer of that classic Mosaic herbaceous "green" dankness is there too. Tiny bit of grapefruit and peach are in the background.
Taste jumps out with loads of juicy mango and tangerine and smaller amounts of pineapple. As you transition into the finish, that herbaceous dankness rushes through to go with, but not overpower, the juicy fruits. Some sweeter grapefruit comes through as well and turns into grapefruit peel into the finish. Semi-dry, but still leaves some residual sugars to balance out the hefty "green" bitterness of pine resin and dankness.
Solid medium body. Smooth and ample carbonation, creamy, and quite soft. Very nice.
I've waited to try this for a while and it did not disappoint. Shows off the complex and intense nature of Mosaic hops wonderfully. These guys get a lot of hype for their stouts, but they also know their way around a hop. Well done. 1,076 charactersbrewskis, Jan 21, 2017

4.81/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Great beer! From the minute I cracked this open I could smell it. Right off the bat I get a citrusy smell along with pineapple and maybe some mango. What ever it is, it smells amazing. Taste wise the mouth follows the smell, the moasic hops for me came through for me and gave a perfect balance. There's an great bitterness/sweetness balance here that far surpasses anything else by TG. I got hit with the bitter right up front, but then as it wheres on you the sweetness comes on at the end for a great after taste. The overall mouth feel for this is really quite smooth and the perfect amount of carbonation. Given its high IBU there's a somewhat dry finish but it's not over powering and the longer I sit between sips the more sweetness that returns. 
Overall this is an outstanding beer by TG and for me it is their best. I've got one more bomber and I can't wait to drink it, it has lived up to the hype. I wish this was bottled consistently, but then again if it was it would probably be just a standard shelf beer then and this definitely isn't a shelf beer. Well done TG, well done! 1,091 charactershtown_engineer, Jan 08, 2017

T- Fruity, but not quite as much as the aroma. Good balance of sweetness and bitterness, neither are powerful. Mosaic hops are noticeable. 
F- Medium body, decent carb. Dry finish.

Look: The pour is clear, but the beer comes out a nice hazy orange, carbonation bubbles rise up to the two fingers of head generated by the pour. 
Smell: The most distinct citrus smell I've gathered from a beer. I also get some dank, resin quality when searching further. 
Taste: Tons of oranges, mandarins, some grapefruit, and a sweeter mango finish. Incredibly good
Feel: Medium bodied, with a drying slight bitterness on the finish. I was expecting a juicier feel. 
Overall: An incredibly good beer. Having King Sue prior, expectations were high for another TG double IPA, and expectations were exceeded. 619 charactersCfred371, Dec 14, 2016

Slightly hazy, deep orange-amber color with a fluffy snow-white head that seems to hang on forever. Luscious aromas of grapefruit, citrus, and pine, with some light floral notes. Not quite as intense on the palate, where the hop intensity is somewhat subdued. Flavors of tangerine and grapefruit, notes of pine resin and citrus rind. Not nearly as bitter as I expected for the high IBU rating. Well balanced, crisp finish without much lingering bitterness on the palate. Alcohol presence is nearly undetectable. Excellent complement to spicy food. Another outstanding hoppy offering from Toppling Goliath. 663 charactersdcotom, Nov 21, 2016

Appearance: Pours a bright golden orange with a moderate amount of rising bubbles. Big two finger white head that slowly settles into a thinner creamy layer. 
Smell: A very dank and juicy hop driven aroma with a scent of citrus fruit and pine. Big tropical fruit scent with some orange peel, mango, apricot, grapefruit, peach, and passion fruit along with pineapple. Earthy hop scent of pine resin, grass, cannabis, and slight onion. Light malt hints of caramel, grains, and cracker with some yeast. A really good juicy aroma. 
Taste: Like it smells, a very juicy and piney hop dominated taste with big notes of citrus fruit and pine resin. Upfront juicy citrus hop notes of ripe orange peel, mango, grapefruit, apricot, passion fruit, and peach along with some pineapple. Earthy hop notes of oily pine resin and grass. Subtle background notes of caramel, cracker, and grains along with some yeast. A great juicy taste. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Very juicy and oily with a drying finish. 
Overall: A really great Single Hop Double IPA. Big ripe tropical fruit and piney hop flavors. 1,174 charactersMattyG85, Nov 19, 2016

4.06/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I must post a disclaimer. I tend to not love Mosaic heavy beers.
Having said this, I found this to be one of the best I've ever had. 
In the nose, it started pretty assertively. I got hints of apricot, but mostly strong tropical notes, some pine, definite onion, and only a hint of cat you know.
But the flavor was much more complex. Definitely tropical, mango, pineapple, then orange, followed by onion. Then the onion backed off a bit and let a juiciness come through that was more orange, followed by a bit of grapefruit pith. The onion never disappeared. It just decided to hover just outside the spotlight.
Mouthfeel was spot on. 634 characters2beerdogs, Oct 17, 2016

It is a deep, orange gold with a sticky off-white head that clings to the side of the glass as it settles. Mostly clear. 
A bunch of pungent tropical fruit, pine, and a little onion and body odor. I would describe it as mostly peach/apricot, mango, orange, and sweat. Everything is so strong that I am not noticing any of the malts. 
Flavors of zesty orange, mango, peach, and pine. A solid, smooth building bitterness. Finishes a little pithy. 
Body is crisp/sparkly/sharp and on the lighter side for an imperial. Feels more like an IPA. 
Great beer. One of the more stinky ones I have had in awhile. 667 charactersWesMantooth, Oct 09, 2016

A dark orange -golden body with a pillowy head full of tiny foamy bubbles, which leaves plenty of lacing in the glass.
Smell you say?  D-A-N-K!  Onion, pine, cat box, citrus, cut grass and pot.
Taste is like piney orange juice!  WOW!  This is delicious!  Bitter and dank up front and sweet on the finish.  Picking up on a slight alcohol bite on the end.  Nothing that makes this unappetizing!  That Mosaic hop just shines in this brew.
A medium mouth feel that makes this DIPA drink like a session IPA to me!  Numbs the palate a little but not in a bad way.
Overall....Let me tell you there is no doubt in my mind that this is one excellent DIPA that lives up to the hype and beyond expectations, for me.  I would have this in my fridge ALL THE TIME if this was readily available here in Florida!  This is one helluva great beer. 925 charactersjhartley, Oct 09, 2016

Served: 11 June 2016
Appearance: Pours a hazy bright yellow with a pearly white head. The head leaves some lacing in the glass, but the beer was a bit old when I cracked it open- no doubt the lacing would be better if this was super fresh. The haze is on the level of a hefeweizen.
Smell: Lots of nice hop notes going on here, very similar to NE IPAs- tropical fruit such as passionfruit, guava, and mango, combined with notes of pine, lemongrass, and pomelo. Really quite a good nose.
Taste: Very similar to the nose. I can't believe this is a double IPA- the maltiness is silky smooth and provides a nice sweet base for the huge hop flavors (which are just about identical to the nose). Little to no astringent bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium carbonation.
Overall: This is one of the best DIPAs I have ever drunk. Expertly masked alcohol. Substantial body without feeling too heavy. Marvelous flavors. Really, really well done. Highly recommended. 995 charactersBeric, Jun 16, 2016

Pours a truly beautiful honey color, almost glowing, medium translucent with a fabulous white head.
Smells of strong mosaic against some light, chewy yeast.  Good, but hop-heavy.
Tastes very good.  Need to take a few sips to process this fully.  Starts off bitter and fruity, gets very fruity and sweet near the middle, finishes on very chewy, bready yeast with some bittersweet hop nodes lingering after the beer's been swallowed.  The balance is exquisite, considering its strength in IBUs, and the fruit-hop profile is the best I've ever come across in a midwestern beer.  And the thick, yeasty finish is strongly reminiscent of something from Hill Farmstead. 710 charactersmynie, Jun 11, 2016

L:  Pours a nearly translucent orange.  1.5-2 fingers of bright white foam, excellent lacing that clings to the glass well after I finished the beer.  
S: Huge nose, especially as it warms.  Scents of mango, pineapple, orange zest, toffee malt, and a faint finish of resinous hops and dakness
T: Exceptionally layered.  Starts as the nose does-pineapple, mango, hint of orange (particularly the slightly astringent bitter finish to a fresh orange).  Malt and subtle bitterness on the finish.  Magnifically balanced.
F:  Not a huge malt backbone for a double IPA, but medium bodied, creamy, smooth mouthfeel.
O:  excellent beer.  One of the best double IPAs that I have had.  Explodes with citrus, but well balanced with malt and just the right amount of bitterness on the finish.  Complex, layered, and delicious 846 charactersCCBone, May 22, 2016

L: Pours a beautiful golden orange. Mostly clear. Decent 1-1.5 finger head of foam. Leaves great lacing around the glass. 
S: Very subtle dankness. Ripe mango and some faint berries. Some floral notes. Very pleasant. 
T: Very hoppy beer. Much more so than Pompeii, which I find to be balanced much better. Though this is still excellent. Still get nice notes of mango and berries. Definite dankness and floral qualities. Definitely a more amplified take on the nose. For the most part, the alcohol is decently masked. Definitely taste it more than I'd like to, but such is life with DIPAs!
F: Honestly, this is perfect. But I almost never give 5s. Nice slightly above medium mouthfeel. Makes you smack your a little. Makes you want more. And more. And more. Excellent.
Overall, this is a great beer. I've yet to be disappointed by Toppling Goliath. Though I find their Pompeii a bit more balanced and more flavorful, this is still a winner. Don't hesitate to pick it up! 1,087 charactersmoysauce, May 15, 2016

 The aroma is tropical citrus juice, pine, and dank hops.
The flavor is intensely juicy largely grapefruit dominated with a crackers bready malt finishing with bitter pine and some weedy dankness. It's outstanding. 263 charactersScott17Taylor, May 07, 2016

There is a decent amount of carbonation in the beer resulting in a decent amount of dense white foam. The aromas have peach, citrus, and grapefruit. The taste is slightly bitter, hop forward, crisp, intense pine notes, and follows the citrusy aromas. Medium body with the aforementioned carbonation. Definitely a hop showcase here. Overall this is a very delicious DIPA and worth seeking out. You will not be let down, cheers! 542 characterstregan_20, Jan 19, 2016

Smells or blood orange, peach, zingy lemon rind and a pleasant dankness, coated up by toffee malts.  Herbal qualities turn more present among flowery biscuits, well balanced by juicy, ripe exotic fruits. 
Has a medium carbonation with a medium body to it, revealing an intense clash between hops an malts on the tongue. Its mouthfeel remains pleasantly creamy though, leaving all nuances of the beer detectable, due to soothing yeast.
Tastes of an initial aqueous softness, establishing the beers great mouthfeel from the kickoff, together with comforting toffee malts. In a split second malts turn absurdly sweet, while the hops try to establish a working balance by introducing garden herbs and dry lime. Finds its peak right after the swallow by producing a dough coated, piercing toffee sweetness, while overloading the palate with bitter hops at the same time. Finishes surprisingly clean, leaving behind its staggering sweetness, now focussing on lemon, prickly kiwi and juicy blood orange.
Almost overpowers my tastebuds, once the beers piercing sweetness gets established from out of nowhere, while hops accept the challenge by creating an equally powerful bitterness. This misses certainly some balance to me, to form a pleasant drinking experience. Usually I would assume a dipa being ruled by its hops, in this particular bottle its been vice versa. 1,428 charactersaleigator, Jan 14, 2016

4.0 A:  Clear medium orange color.  Two fingers of creamy beige head.  Retention is good and a couple different looking waves of lacing are left.
4.5 S:  Booming floral and citrus hops.  Mango and papaya dominate.  Next the aroma becomes resiny and floral.  Then a big hit of orange, then pineapple.  It finishes with a touch of earth.
4.5 T:  Heavier moderate bitterness.  Heavy citrus dominate again.  Mango, orange, and papaya are the most potent.  Flowery and dankly resiny.  On the sweeter side, but the malts are mainly neutral.
4.25 M:  Heavier medium to heavy body.  Good moderate carbonation.  Viscous without being sticky and good creaminess present.

M. SUPER crisp, high carbonation, light body (for a IIPA - that crazy), super smooth. 
O: I was blown away by the crisp cleanness of this beer. It really reminds me of Pliney in the sense it is like water and hops. IN no way is this boozey and really could be a "session" beer. Very well crafted. 665 charactersmacher0, Dec 05, 2015

4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is definitely "all that and a bag of chips."
The beer pours a peachy orange color with really good head retention and lacing.  The nose is pretty wonderful in this beer, as I pick up considerable peach and apricot, with a back bone of tropical fruit (mango, papaya, etc.) and light pine and citrus.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, but this beer seemed to have just layers of flavor.  The sweet tropical fruit was up front, but the finish was dry, citrusy and lightly bitter.  Mouthfeel was really good as well; the beer was full and long, with a kiss of bitterness on the finish.  Alcohol was certainly noticeable, but not in a bad way.  There was no heat or heaviness on the finish, and drinkability was exceptional.  I took the better part of an hour to drink this beer and enjoyed every moment of the experience.  
Very, very impressive! 876 charactersJohn_M, Nov 04, 2015

4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bomber bottled 9/20.
A: Hazy, golden, orange color. What I'd guess pulp-less GF juice to look like. 1/4 finger, clean white head. Small bubbles. 
N: Juicy grapefruit jumps out of glass. Sweet, candied citrus - orange-y. Synthetic rubber character. Faint bread-y malt. Very faint. Maybe a slight "green" character. Smells awesome. 
T: Grapefruit front and center. Mild tartness, like grapefruit rind. Tropical, maybe mango. Malt hits middle of palate to balance. Bitter on the back that lingers. Very well balanced DIPA. 
F: Medium-soft. Coats pretty well, but not syrupy or heavy  typical of "lesser" DIPAs. 
O: Simply a very well balanced and well constructed DIPA. Manages to showcase the Mosaic hops without "overselling" them. No doubt the hops are front and center, but the malt plays perfectly along side them. Seek this one out. 852 charactersBullDoza, Oct 24, 2015

F: Smooth and very drinkable.

Once I opened the bottle I was hit with a citrus / tropical fruit scent that stayed with me the entire time I drank the beer.
This is one tasty beer, I am not sure how I would describe it but I must say this is seriously the Nectar of the Gods!!!   Could really taste the citrus and a was very smooth, it almost had a juice taste rather than a beer taste.  Filled my mouth with a beautiful hop flavor and my throat felt it was lined with a sweet candy once I was done with the beer.
DIPA is my favorite styles and I have to say SOSUS blew my mind away.   I have had all the greats SOS, Heady, Pliny, Julius etc and to me Sosus is hands down my favorite.  I am really thankful to have gotten to try this beer. 902 characterswarrendietrich2001, Sep 15, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight tulip glass. Thank you very much Paul for hooking me up with this awesome extra.
Pours a hazy golden body with a fluffy white head that reduces slowly to leave some chunky retention and spotty lacing after a few minutes. 
Aromas are sharp and pungent.. very resinous, piney, peppery, lots of citrus, citrus rinds, oranges. 
The tongue matches the nose, very citrusy, orange and grapefruit dominate here, with a piney, resinous bite sitting on a decent slightly sweet malt backbone. Lingering bitterness for half a minute after sipping. Mouthfeel is medium body and carbonation. 
Super enjoyable, very nice offering from TG. It would be one of my go-to's if it was more readily available. 757 charactersgcamparone, Sep 06, 2015

S - dank-a-potomous rex. Garlic, onion. Lots of tropical fruits - orange, mango, kiwi, even some blueberry. Ganja. This is definitely a dank IPA. 
T - Follows the nose. So intense with the dank, ganja, garlic onion but then tropical flavors. I did not realize how amazing Mosaic hops were. 
M - medium mouthfeel. Alc completely covered. aftertaste is dank resinous hops that sticks for a while.

hazy orange color, head disappeared pretty quickly
smell of citrus, fruit, a little bit of grapefruit
right off the bat, i compared it to King Sue and prefer the king to Sosus. still a great a beer, and king sue is one of my favorites ever. taste a lot of orange and tropical fruits
goes down very smooth, moderate carbonation, and seemed to be less as i kept drinking
great beer. really enjoyed this. had a great weekend at TG and loved everything they had. top notch beer from a top notch brewery. 563 charactersgovlady, Aug 31, 2015

Pours golden orange in color with a short, fleeting head that leaves spots of lace.  Nice big nose of sweet citrus (oranges and tangerines), tropical fruit and hints of pine tar.  The taste is more subdued, but with the same suspects.  In the forefront still are the sweet citrus and tropical notes, but there is also a decent malty, bready component and a long, bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is a bit heavy and maybe slightly under-carbonated.  Still a delicious beer! 508 charactersmtomlins, Jul 08, 2015

22oz bottle provided by the glorious @mr-jj, served in a large mug. 0525 A2 2356 is printed on the bottom. Maybe that means it was bottled near the end of February of this year? If so, not too fresh -- but I have no idea if that's what it means. Use a real date, please. Poured completely; got some little flaky floaters.
Pours brassy-amber. not much head, hazy, and with the aforementioned clumps. Smell is delicious. Tropical fruity. A little grass.
Taste is citrusy (orange, mostly), a little tropical (pineapple, maybe), a little floral sweetness, strong bitter aftertaste. Good balance, tasty beer. Flavor's a little milder than I would expect for a double IPA, but very tasty.
Mouthfeel is medium-thin bodied and slightly slick. Overall, this is a quite good beer. If this one's old...I'd love to try a fresher one. 835 characterssnaotheus, Jul 03, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Look:  Very attractive.  Rich orange body.  Like King Sue, the body is darker orange, opaque.  When held up to the sun, there is no shine through.  The white head is patchy and clingy.  After a bit, the head retreats into a scruffy halo around the glass, with a patchy island near the middle.
Smell:  Overripe tangerine, pineapple juice, sweetness, hops, and background grapefruit.  
Taste:  Right off the bat, I like King Sue better.  I had King Sue the day before yesterday.  The tastes, are of course similar, but different :)  King Sue has more distinct flavors.  This seems a little muddled.  Sweet tangerine, oranges, pineapple juice, grapefruit, and some hops.  
Feel:  Medium body.  Carbonation is medium-low.  For me, the feel is a bit of a letdown.  Maybe a little sparkle in the mouth and on the tongue.  No rich lather...Not bad, but nothing to call my fellow BA brothers about.
Overall - King Sue was juicy.  This was not.  Maybe I shouldn't have had the two so close together.  King Sue, Abner, Permanent Funeral, and Pliny are all better.  Notice how I did not mention HT :(  What do I know, you be the judge.  It is a very good beer.  My expectations were just too high. 1,187 charactersmabermud, Jun 15, 2015

Smell:  Floral and fruity, with citrus, tropical fruit and pine
Taste:  A touch of malt provides the platform for the hops to dance on the tastebuds, producing citrus (orange, primarily) and tropical fruit tones (mango and pineapple) and a touch of pine; floral and fruity with moderate bitterness
Mouthfeel:  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  Another top flight DIPA from Toppling Goliath; we need more brewers to produce DIPAs like this 576 charactersbrentk56, May 21, 2015

4.76/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured cold into  tulip glass.  No bottling date, but I know it was bottled around three weeks ago.  Consumed on 9/12/14.
Look = 4.25 Pours a heavily cloudy lighter orange gold color with 1.5 fingers of just off white head that fades to a cap.  Retention is great and lace is terrific.  The cloudiness detracts from the score here.  Normally this beer is clear but according to TG they couldn’t do it with this batch.
Aroma = 5 Single hopped with mosaic hops and you can tell!  Crazy hop forward aroma.  Citrus and tropical fruits everywhere, mango, orange, pineapple, ect. Super fresh smelling, wonderful.
Taste = 4.75 Follows the nose and lives up to it!  Citrus and tropical fruit notes throughout.  Only a mild bitterness on the backend.  Great tasting beer.
Feel = 4.5 Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation.  Lighter body then most DIPAs and it fits the flavor profile perfectly.  Very refreshing for a DIPA.
Drinkability = 4.75 Probably the most drinkable DIPA I’ve ever had.  Light and refreshing at 8% ABV with only a mild bitterness.  Super fresh smelling and tasting.
Overall = 4.7 This beer is nuts.  Highest scoring IPA I’ve ever had.  The aroma, taste, feel and drinkability are all off the charts. Amazing. 1,235 characterskbwalters, Apr 04, 2015

From a bomber into a snifter
Mosaic hop solo-show
APPEARANCE: Same but a touch darker. Hazy gamboge orange. Cut and paste most.  
SMELL: Citrus, lemon zest with grapefruit notes, some light pine qualities and some definite spiciness on the nose. Enticing. Lightly peppery. 
TASTE: Lots of citrus and honeydew melon sweetness up front, with grapefruit and bitter hops at the swallow. Big and lingering finish of melon, grapefruit, bitter hops, piney bitterness and some light spices as well. Lots of pine and spicy hops linger on the palate. 
PALATE: Same as above. Cut and paste. 
OVERALL: This and King Sue are of completely equal quality. This one is flavorful and enjoyable and the mosaic hops add a certain piney and spicy component that was a nice touch. For myself, I think I preferred the straight up citra bomb that was King Sue, but these are both top class IPA’s. Thanks again for the share on these gents. Recommended. 1,089 charactersJeffo, Nov 09, 2014

Pours a 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention. Lacing is stringy and spotty with excellent stick. Beer is a clear, bright goldenrod. Really nice looking beer.
Nose is outstandingly aromatic. Hints of citrus, papaya, starfruit and a dank, juicy hop bitterness that's really in your face. A bit of sweet and soapiness help to round things out.
Opens citrus, pineapple and starfruit. Tropical fruit hop bitterness in the middle with a touch of cane sugar to balance things out. Finishes more citrus, dank hop bitterness and just a hint of sweetness at the end. Great balance and flavor.
Light to medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and goes down silky and lightly aggressive at the back end. Finishes dry with a sticky, lingering aftertaste. Spot on and very drinkable. 
While certainly top notch, this beer isn't as good as the other ratings suggest. Great balance, flavor and feel but there's a certain brightness that's missing to put it over the top.  Still, definitely worth having though. 1,129 charactersSpeedwayJim, Oct 26, 2014

Flavor has nice fruity hop flavor up front followed by bitter pine backbone. The bitterness is much more assertive than king sue. It's a clean bitterness that finishes with a nice pine character. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied and well carbonated. Overall, another delicious dipa from Toppling Goliath. 466 charactershomebrew311, Sep 06, 2014

4.63/5  rDev +2.9%22oz bottle from the release a couple of weeks ago.  Poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass.
A - Pours pale straw golden in color, faint haze, endless streams of bubbles from the center of the
glass.  A thick two finger head of dense white foam caps the beer and shows excellent staying
power.  Lots of soapy lacing left on the glass.
S - Really fresh aroma (as expected from such a young bottle).  Very sweaty hop profile, peachy,
citrusy grapefruit, grapefruit rind.  Really intense hop aroma.   Gives a very bitter impression
overall.  Malt doesn't stand a chance here.
T - A bit of an earthy malt base, faint but noticeable at the base.  A somewhat earthy hop
bitterness accompanies this nicely.  Quite bitter, sharp and crisp and long-lasting/lingering.  Hops
flavoring is a bit more subtle than the aroma would indicate, although not faint at all.  Tons of 
bitter grapefruit peel and flesh, citrusy flavors work well here.  Fairly intense pine notes give a
sticky and resiny character.  Some tropical aspects grab hold also - pineapple most notably to
my palate.
M - Straight up medium body with a somewhat soft carbonation.  Sticky and resiny overall in feel
 with a stiff bitterness.  Faintly sweet at times, other sips bypass this completely.  Hop showcase
for sure.
O - Certainly a top notch DIPA.  My favorite of all time...probably not, but I would place this
solidly in my top 10.  Isn't going to get much fresher than this, and freshness would seem to be
a real key here...so many hops that will fade quickly.  Definitely glad to be able to try this one as
fresh as this bottle is. 1,605 charactersportia99, Sep 05, 2014

Color is cloudy and golden. Sticks to the glass. Smells of tangerines, mandarins, and some melon. Grassy qualities, too. Taste is very much the same with a subtle hop bitterness and a pinch of booze.

4.55/5  rDev +1.1%Bottled about 10 days ago. Tulip glass. 
A: Pours an orange-tinted straw color, opaque, with two fingers of beautiful snow white, pillowy head.  Excellent retention and intricate lacing.  (4.5)
S: Gorgeous, juicy mango, grapefruit, and tangerine, some herbal (bordering on spice) notes, with a pale malt and crackery/bready backbone.  An intricate and delicate aroma.  (4.5)
T: The pale malt is a bit more forward here, though light citrus, pine and herbal notes are still prominent enough.  Finishes mostly dry which accentuates the moderate-light hop bitterness.  The finish is a bit of a muddled bitterness, which is the only fault I can really find.  (4.5)
M: Soft, medium body and medium carbonation.  (4.75)
O: Though not quite top flight, that Sosus ale is an excellent DIPA that gets close to the better stuff from Alpine or HF.  Highly drinkable.  Nowhere near a potent, hop-forward DIPA if that’s what you’re looking for.  (4.5) 947 characterspmarlowe, Aug 31, 2014

Nicely carbonated, nice white lacing, big juicy, fruiy, grapefruit bowl of hoppy goodness with some malty backbone.

4.88/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I had this a long time ago and rated it a perfect 5... It was at a small tasting and at the end of a long -mostly big/high abv- stout night.  But I absolutely loved it and cried when it was gone.... This makes me nervous to revisit because I hope my first impression was accurate, here we go:
Looks beautiful like a like orange hazy mist. non-transparent but lovely looking with small head retention, very welcoming and fruity looking. awesome.
Smell is on point, damn Mosaic hops always seem to kill it in this category.  just huge danky/oranges. its beautiful. Pineapple/orange green goodness this smells uber fresh (even though its not) and just overall intoxicating.
So it tastes just like it smells except it's better! because I couldn't wait to taste this, super tasty fruit nectar of the gods. this is so flavor forward. Gosh damn this is incredible, the alcohol is forward and thats hardly a complaint because it doesn't taste bad, everything is working well together.
Mouthfeel is perfect! sweet action with big bitters and high abv... yet it all melts in your mouth. the rich flavor just works so well, would call this a perfect medium mouthfeel.
Overall I can't say enough about this beer, so well crafted, so juicy, so good it should be illegal. 1,258 charactersM_chav, Jul 24, 2014

A - perfect hazy orange 
S - tropical bright kind of mango pineappleish
T - follows the nose. Very smooth. 
M - perfect - DNase enough but still so drinkable
O- close to a 5 - everything I want from a double IPA. I believe this beer features the Mosaic hop which, to me is very similar in profile to the Citra. It does a great job showcasing it. I dream of making beer like this. 504 charactersBshaw22, Jun 25, 2014

Thanks to @usckevin from Twitter & IG on this one
App- A mellow looking hazzy yellowish orange color. A nice frothy 1-1/2" head that took a while to fade. Left very thick and full cling lines and were very distinct down the sides of the glass.
Smell- The floral from the all mosaic was beautiful. Full, lush and creamy on the aromatics. A bit of bitter hops comes on the end of a long pull. The citrus was more defined and was very tropical. Mango, guava and honeydew IMO.
Taste- I really liked the mosaic display on this one. A very flavorful DIPA with outbeing over done. The harsh burn of a large DIPA was not here. Replaced by lush flavors with a mild hop bitterness in the back of the drink.
Mouth- A large and creamy medium body with a medium carbonation level. A good amount of froth and foam on each sip. Like the smell, full, lush and creamy.
Taste- This was a very good beer. Would love to get some more, but from a tiny little place in IA. I was glad I got at least 1 bottle. 1,037 charactersFosterJM, Jun 10, 2014

Kinda resembles Schlafly's T-IPA (mosaic) but not sure if it holds up beside it. 
the malt is very subtle and the mosaic hops aren't as brilliant as I know they can be. The fade is musty bitterness. 
Excited to maybe try this one again someday. Slightly hard to get a hold of in the first place. 420 charactersOhiovania, May 24, 2014

A: Pours a clear pale golden beneath a finger of dense, soft, and greasy looking off white head that reminds me of melted vanilla ice-cream. The head held some good retention before eventually fading into a fuzzy film that left thick rings of lace down the glass after every sip.
S: Huge dominating notes of mosaic hops. I get scents of juicy citrus, wintergreen mint, and a touch of tropical fruit nectars. Orange cream sickles come to mind as well. Juicy and sweet smelling overall. 
T: Follows the nose with huge notes of tangerine, orange cream, passion fruit and papaya juice, with a kiss of mint bringing up the rear. The finish is slightly spicy with hints of black pepper and a herbal leafiness, but it is also sweet and lightly bitter. 
M: Full greasy body, slick and oily mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Hop resin and oil lend some decent bitterness and chewiness to the body, but this is more sweet and fruity than anything. Slight wintergreen tingle. 
O: Another near flawless dipa, but definitely not as good as pseudosue in my opinion. Still, TG continues to impress and I wish I could drink this every day. 1,167 charactersscottfrie, May 23, 2014
3.65/5  rDev -18.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75This is an Double IPA brewed entirely with Mosaic hops. I'll admit I haven't actually been a big fan of this hop in the past and this one was the test to end all tests for if that held true.
Aroma of lemon, orange peel, pineapple. Sweet marmalade. Appearance is light gold with a fine white head. The flavor rather bitter up front rather than the sweet I was expecting from the aroma. There is a distinct sharp hop clash and bitterness right away in the taste. Fruit flavors of papaya, unripe mango and tart berries as the hop bitterness fades a bit. A hint of sweetness but this beer is dry and bitter, bordering on astringent.
 Overall I did like the beer but something about the balance on it didn't hit me right. I would have liked that fruitiness up front more and less astringency. I'm still not completely sold on Mosaic but this is certainly the best beer I've tried so far that features that hop. I know I'm the minority here, so no flame wars please! 962 charactersJackofallbrews, May 22, 2014

a - Pours a hazy golden orange color with one finger of fluffy off white head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks good.
s - Smells of citra hops, oranges, citrus, tropical fruits,honey, pine hops, and mangos. Awesome nose, super fruity and hoppy. I love it.
t - Tastes of oranges, citrus hops, tropical fruits, pineapple, mangos, and light pine hops and resin. No bitterness at all. Great taste.
m - Medium body and low carbonation. Easy to drink. Juicy mouthfeel.
o - Overall a fantastic DIPA; tried it close to Bodhi by Columbus and thought it was much better. Super juicy with a lot of hops and fruits, and no bitterness at all. Well worth seeking out. 803 charactersmdfb79, May 22, 2014
4.96/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Pours a light orange with a two-finger head which dissipates quickly. Decent lacing. The aroma is citrus, peaches, pineapples and mangoes. What an awesome display of the mosaic hop! Lots of fruit in the palate - citrus, passion fruit, peaches, pineapples and mangoes. Grapefruit,mpine resin, and malt in the finish. Medium bodied with decent carbonation and oily hop residue left on the tongue. Overall, potentially the finest double IPA I've ever had, outstanding work Toppling Goliath! 487 charactersJohnG190, May 22, 2014

Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, berry, and slight herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with honey, citrus zest, and berry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with really nice citrus and berry forward hop qualities all around. 635 charactersUCLABrewN84, May 19, 2014

Pours light golden color with a thick white fluffy head on top. Aroma of vegetal hops (mmmm), grass, pine, (and maybe even a little weed mixed in). Flavor follows with a beautiful floral and vegetal hop note, some incredibly light sweet malts in the backdrop for a DIPA, grass, pine, ever so slight citrus rind but this focuses more on the grassiness. Medium bodied with medium carbonation and very easy drinking. Excellent brew, but probably overshadowed by Duet which I had right before it. 555 charactersBMMillsy, May 17, 2014

Smell is nice tropical grapefruit, pineapple, orange with what seems to be a tiny sweet malt backbone.
Taste is nice blend of tropical with all that was mentioned in the nose with a tiny bit of bitterness but nothing really strong that hangs in the throat. There is definitely some sweet malts in the background to balance this out as it really is a nice treat to taste. Pretty well balanced although more hop forward for sure.
Mouthfeel is in the middle given the great carbonation although truly a little less than medium if not swashed around the mouth. Really nice for the syle.
Overall this is another hit out of the park for Toppling Goliath. I haven't had anything by them that I didn't like and this is certainly no different. Just a great beer that delivers. 887 charactersTheBeerDrinker, May 10, 2014

The beer pours a hazy, opaque, copper color, hues of orange and apricot with a thick, soapy, white head, about a finger high, moderate retention but leaves a lovely wall of lace behind. The aroma is of resinous pine, bitter grapefruit, pineapple, mango, nice tropical brightness, but strong resinous and sappy qualities with some sweet malt and alcohol burn. The flavors are balanced a bit better, tangy and bitter grapefruit citrus, juicy fresh fruit, pineapples, mangos, passionfruit that does bring out some sweetness. Pine, resin and hop spice, earthy and bitter provide a nice counterbalance to the bright fruit flavors, before sweet, rich malt and light alcohol dominate the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, coats well, a little less lively than expected, the body could use a touch more carbonation, it feels thick, but still quite juicy, with a lightly dry finish.
Verdict: A very nice DIPA from Toppling Goliath, a bit earthier than I prefer, but it showcases the Mosaic hop quite well. Unfortunately, mosaic has proven to be a hop I am relatively indifferent about, but this might be the best example of it. A bit more carb could help this one a bit, but it's still a very, very fine beer. 1,301 characterskevanb, Apr 04, 2014

S-Mosaic hops flow into my nose. Tangy citrus. All the tropical notes you could ask for. Pineapple, peach and apricot. Plenty of dank herbal notes and pine. Very aromatic. 
T-The Mosaic hops are pushed to their limits in this beer. Tangy, almost lemony citrus. Tons of ripe pineapple, melon and grapefruit. Finishes with a well balanced, pale and bready maltiness as well as a solid grassy and piney hoppiness. Mosaic hops have a very unique aroma and flavor.
M-Juicy and resiny. High bitterness but it doesn't rip the enamel off your teeth. Long finish. No heat. Very nice.
O/D-Sampled it next to Toppling Goliath's King Sue. King Sue made this one seem tame but then I went back and tried it again and it really blew me away standing on its own. An elite, nearing perfect DIPA. 868 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 23, 2014

Appearance: Hazy orange clover honey body with a minimal head. What head was present was a vibrant snow white. Lacing is abundant as you sip it down.
Smell: A nice bouquet of grapefruit and lemon followed by some dank intermingling about. The citrus was immediately noticed when you popped the top.
Taste: Grapefruit, green onion and a wee bit dank are your key players here. I get big sweet orange and some pine resin in the finish. 
Mouthfeel: A bit tacky, kinda like finishing a big gulp of fresh OJ. The walls of your mouth and tongue are coated with a bit of stickiness. 
Overall: I love Mosaic hopped beers and this is no exception. An excellent offering from TG. I really dig the citrus notes and orange finish in this one. Definitely recommend. 774 charactersdarthvohn, Mar 22, 2014

Bottling line finally up and going and releases of Kentucky Brunch, Mornin' Delight, XHops, and Sosus have them one of the most talked about breweries in the country. Early in '13, Sue and Sosus were released simultaneously and people went crazy for it, and still do. This Imperial IPA focuses on the mosaic hop bringing out citrus and tropical fruit notes along with some dankness that make this an easy pick for the Hot 25 in Eastern Iowa! 504 charactersiabeerbaron, Jan 21, 2014

4.13/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 422oz bomber bottle with an awesome label that resembles a stained glass window. This stained glass depicts a frosty pint of beer with the name of the beer and the style of beer in the glass of beer. Above the pint is the Topping Goliath medical cross symbol. Flanking both sides of the stained glass is the Govt. Warning and a paragraph that describes the beer. A brewed date or a bottled date would have been extremely nice. 
When poured into a J. Wakefield Snifter, this Midwestern Double IPA was a nice and lightly hazy pale kumquat orange with some faded straw yellow mixed into it. This DIPA was clear of all hop particles. It was just naturally hazy. On top of this pale and faded colored beer was a decent 1/4 of an inch pearl white head of foam. This mediocre sized head of foam had decent retention that left behind a solid white string of rings and a sticky streak of lace here and there. 
There was a strong scent of hops in the aroma, but I wouldn't say that the aroma was a complete hop bomb. There was strong almost candy like sweetness that dumbed down the hop aroma a bit. It was a strong citrus hop aroma with a dash of piney hops. Intermingled with the hops was some grapefruit, lemon zest, and a drop of orange. I caught a whiff of bready malts trying to emerge from the background, but that sweetness came in and covered it up. 
Now this is more like it! The taste is what I thought the aroma should have been. The hops kicked out the sweetness and they were now allowed to wreak havoc on my tastebuds. The citrus hops were strong, but not offensively strong. Following the hops was a little grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, and pine. It was nice of the hops and the citrus fruits to let the bready malts through and stay there for a little bit. 
This was a medium to full bodied DIPA with a good amount of carbonation and a full flavored hoppy aftertaste. The aftertaste was chock full of citrus hops, grapefruit, lemon zest, and pine. The hops lingered on for some time in the back of my throat. 
Big Thanks to fellow BA mnbuffalo for hooking me up with this small Topping Goliath treat. The color was nice, too sweet in the aroma, but where it mattered most, the taste, this beer delivered. Would I drink it again? I'm good. One bottle is fine. 2,276 charactersAltBock, Jan 16, 2014

The beer pours out a pale orange-gold color, slightly hazy, with a really tight 3 fingers of white head that sticks around like grim death. Really great nose on this beer! Lost of sweet and tart tropical fruit notes like pineapples, ripe peaches, lemons, sour apple jolly ranchers, and oranges.
Medium-light body and intense hoppy, citrus-fruit flavor. Slight bready sweetness up front with a hint of pineapple and orange marmalade, and then lots of fruity, lemony bitterness crashes in. The beer provides a sweet backbone that balances out the attack nicely (impressive since the ABV is not what one usually considers typical of a IIPA), but never ever makes the taste medicinal. In the back of the palate, I get a dank, hemp-like undertaste that joins forces with the sweetness as they battle the hops, but we all know who wins. The finish is fruity sweet, bitter, and very, very appetizing, with lingering flavors of lemon and pineapple. This beer goes down way too easy and way too fast!
Crazy good IIPA! It strikes me as a cross between Hop Slam (for the sweetness) and GL Alchemy Hour (for the citrus fruit, body, and the dank flavor on the back of the palate). I'm smitten. 1,230 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Dec 16, 2013

Bright gold and copper body, dusting of white foam on the lid, and some decent lacing is found on the side of the glass.
Odors range from grapefruit to green onion, Sosus is a little dank with a sweet citrus under current. And talk about odorous, you can smell this one as soon as you pop the cap!
That same dank profile of earthiness and green onion is present on the palate. However there is also a nice surprise in the way of orange citrus, peppercorns, and a little resin. The orange is what comes through the most in the finish. Seasoned IPA drinkers will not get a proverbial kick in mouth from the bitterness.
Sosus drinks as smooth as honey: creamy and a great feeling of heaviness.
This is yet another TG offering that drinks incredibly easy for a bigger beer. The dank hop profile meshes very well with the tangy and sweet flavors of citrus and pepper. I personally do not rate it higher because it is not where I prefer hop flavors to go. 975 charactersPintofbrown, Nov 11, 2013

I'm tired and it's late so I'll try to keep this simple. The color is perfect. Dark orange straw in color, whatever. The smell is delicious, really wonderful. Tropical citrus with ripe, melon smelling hoppy funk! Really inviting.
T- This is what it's all about. Unbelievably delicious. Citrusy grapefruit but very clean. This is the second time I have been able too try this beer and I thought the first time may have been an abnormally good bottle the first time. This second beer confirms it, it's fantastic! 
My favorite IPA is Alpine Nelson, I know this is a Double, but this is now my second favorite IPA being made, thanks Toppling Goliath! 706 characterssendsilk, Oct 24, 2013

S - Tropical citrus fruit, mango, oranges, and a little bit of sweet yeasty character.
T - Pineapple, oranges, passion fruit - Sweet tropical fruit from start to finish with sweet malt underneath. Sweet hoppy from start to finish but eventually starts to get "sugary" after awhile on the very end.
M - Medium body and velvety smooth with a lingering hoppy fruit finish.
O - Definitely worth a try. 519 charactersjzeilinger, Oct 20, 2013

Appearance. Pours yellow gold with a very light haze. Topped with 1.5 fingers of white head that leaves some thick lace behind.
Smell. Big grapefruit and lemon rind, tropical fruits and some grainy light malts, a touch of cedar and honey.
Taste. Again, big grapefruit and other citrus fruit, some papaya, some woody pine and light grainy malts (a little on the sweet side). Good bitterness in the finish but not overbearing. 
Mouthfeel. Medium+ body, below medium carbonation. 
Overall. Very nice stuff. Will satisfy your hop cravings. 583 charactersRutager, Oct 13, 2013

Thanks hyroglyphk!
A: Pale yellow. Or maybe office fluorescent lights don't do it justice.
S: Grass, earthy, maybe pine. No citrus, zest, etc.
T: Good but not great. Can taste the same elements I smell but I like my DIPAs to have a little lemony or grapefruity zest, or pine stickiness. The lack of overly bitter bite at the end is appreciated
M: Close to perfect for a DIPA
O: Just below outstanding based on the scale here. Too many great DIPAs out there to go after the TG hype. Certainly worth it if easily accessible but not something I would seek out. 595 charactersjuliusseizure, Oct 12, 2013

A- Pours a brilliantly clear orange/copper with an inch white head. Great retention. 
S-Grapefruit, lemon zest, oranges, mango- a mixture of tropical fruit with a little bit of grassy. A touch of bready malt comes out also. 
T- Huge fresh hop flavor- a ton of grapefruit and pineapple dominate. Bitterness is right where I want it to be. Present, but it isn't harsh or sharp. There is a little bit of caramel/bready malt on the back end, providing some balance to the full frontal assault of hops.
M- A little sharp and dry, although right on the edge of where I like it. Drinks easily...I wish it had a touch less carbonation though. 
O- Fantastic DIPA from a brewery I wish I could drink from every day. Not a whole lot to say- this is definitely a big double IPA. Dry enough to let the hops shine through, but enough malt support so they aren't overpowering. 
hnnng/10, would drink again. 927 charactersjustforrazors, Oct 12, 2013

Clear light golden pour with carbonation as expected. 
S: Hops. Some earthy dankness. Leans to the piney side, tropical fruits too. Nice pungency
T: Piney dank earthy hops, tropical fruits, and not much else. Alcohol shows up on the aftertaste, unfortunately, but it doesn't ruin the fun. It just taints it a bit.
M: Pretty clean. I wanted more resin to muck things up. 
O: This is really good, but just short of great. 
I think I'd choose Zeelander or a good batch of Sue if I'm drinking TG. 544 characterscaskstrength, Oct 08, 2013

poured into the proper glass! A Toppling Goliath belgian style tulip/snifter glass.
Bottled on Wednesday 10/2/2013.
Appearance: glowing and bright straw yellow beer with 1 full finger of head. Head has a decent amount of staying power, but eventually drops down to a thin cap. Thick lacing remains on the side of the glass.
Smell: Sweet oranges, tropical fruits, and honeydew melon. Little bit of dankness too. Bready and biscuity malts. 
Taste: Huge hop flavors that impart a mild bitterness. This is an orange and pineapple bomb which actually tastes sweet and juicy! Melons, orange and lemon zest, mangos, melon rind, and a general light fruity presence. Biscuity malts all the way with a touch of sweetness similar to honey. The beer has a mild bitterness in the finish with a hint of pine resin and dank hop. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low end of moderate carbonation. This beer has a very creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is near perfection and the beer drinks well below its 8% abv. Super drinkable DIPA. 
Overall: This beer reminds me alot of Lawson's Double Sunshine which is my favorite DIPA as well as my highest reviewed DIPA. The big difference between Sosus and Double Sunshine is that TG makes thier hoppy beers to taste and feel so very juicy. I cant think of any other hoppy beers besides Sosus and PseudoSue that have such a juicy quality to them. Double sunshine is a little more on the dry side, but both beers equally awesome. Between PsuedoSue and Sosus; Toppling Goliath has truely given me a greater appreciation for hops. I dont know what Topping Goliath does when they brew thier hoppy beers, but the result is absolutely magical every single time. I honestly prefer a Sosus or Double Sunshine over a bottle of Kern River Citra DIPA. Yep, I just said it... It about time that the Midwest has hoppy beer that rival or are better than(in my opinion)both east and west coast as far as hoppy beers are concerned! 2,050 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Oct 07, 2013

4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I have pretty good faith when I buy a beer from this Iowa brewery. I bought a 22 oz. and saw everyone was buying their max 2 bottle alotment. I bought 1. It was still chilled so i brought it right home and opened it.
Poured into a pretty big glass and got a bright gold body with lots of bubbles from the bottom. Thick white head with great lacing.
This beer is very fresh and it smells that way. Lots of tropical fruit and that's about all I get.
Now for the taste... This is probably the strongest IPA flavor wise I have had. I don't mean the in your face pine or grapefruit. I mean tropical, citrus, apricot and malt. Wow. This is truly a wonderful blend of the above. Slightly sweet but just right. Nice creamy fish and a strong apricot and hints of other citrus lingers in your palate. This beer is what I like in the IPA family. Close to perfect. I hear the production is kicking up so maybe I can get this again. I have only heard of it here once before. 964 charactersdaledeee, Oct 04, 2013

The smell on this guy is enormous. Really caught me off guard, actually. It's piney on the front, floral on the back, and citrus in the middle. Pretty remarkable smell. I'm more fond of the huge citrus/tropical myself, but there is no doubt this is impressive. 
The taste is top notch--incredible hop presence. Piney and floral resin mixed with a cornucopia of tropical fruits. Pretty damn intense and pretty bitter. There is a unique spiciness in the beer that reminds me of ZD, actually. In that case it must be citra, but all other citra beers I've had lack that spiciness. I don't even know if there is citra in this? Maybe mosaic? I don't know. I'm loving this beer though. There is a lot of breadiness too, and decent sweetness to round things out.
EDIT: Thanks to Stevedore for pointing out my ignorance and telling me that it's single hop mosaic.
Mouthfeel is very good. Characteristic of the elite ipas, but a little thinner. Still amazing. 
Overall, this is wayyyy up there on the iipa chain for me. I'm shocked with how good this is. I guess after having Zeelander on firkin with citra, I shouldn't be surprised though. Way to kill it, TG! 1,250 characterslunarbrew, Oct 03, 2013

Pours straw yellow with a nice head and moderate lacing.
Oh does anything scream blueberries more than the Mosiac? No, no fucking way.
Creamy and subsequently sticky hop delivery vehicle. Big time blueberry pie, light sugars, crust, touch of green onion, and lingering catty sweetness. 
A DIPA that showcases the Mosaic well and keeps the all too frequent boozy sweetness mostly in check. I like TG and appreciate the increased frequency at which I'm able to try their beers. A nice double for sure, but don't panty knot or Aaron Hernandez your way to a bottle. 648 charactersBarrytheBear, Jun 27, 2013

A: Dense, deep yellow color. The pour drops a small white head that lingers and leaves nice lace. I was expecting a more orangy tint to the color, but I'm not disappointed.
A: Sticky, citrusy hops with a resiny character. Hop juice all around here. Notes of dank mango, sticky grass, and citrus. 
T: Kind of a mangoy, peach, citrus thing going on with a light backbone of sweet malt. Soooo many flavors going on. Dank up front, sweet in the middle and Bitter on the finish, very welcomed.
M: Medium body prefect levels of carbonation. 
O: This is one fine brew. I was expecting something with a bit more body and sweetness, but what I got was an absolute excellent example of a dipa. The bitterness from the hops play perfectly with the light sweetness from the beer. This one is highly recommended. I only wish I had more than the one bottle. 951 charactersGtreid, Jun 08, 2013

Maybe I'm getting ahead of my self since I only had one bomber, but this has the super juicy, resiny, oily feel that all of the big boys are trying to get but few do.
Slick, pungent, with nice hops...just perfect. As for the appearance, I prefer a hazy unfiltered look, but really, who cares. It's drop dead delicious. I have a feeling this brewery is going to be huge. 584 characterscelfan, Jun 07, 2013

Pours almost clear, just some very fine yeast, gold colored, carrying a finger of off white foam. Sheets and legs of lace hang above a ring of foam after a bit.
Med./High strength aroma, and it is really nice.Lemon, pear, grapefruit, some neutral sweet, just a hint of yeast, even some floral in this single hop yet complex bouquet.
All the flavors of the nose in perfect balance, bright, clean, in a med./high strength taste.. It is a delicious mix, just fantastic, highlighted by the merest hint of sweet that frames it all, and a sip that finishes dry.
It is highly viscous, and yet quite light on the palate, full of resiny goodness, clean as a whistle, perfect low carb., refreshing, and a finish that is top of the class.
If you see this beer be sure to get some and share it, your friends will appreciate it as much as do I. Thanks, Mike!! 938 characterscavedave, Jun 04, 2013

Type: 22oz. Bomber
Vintage: 2013, but unsure to exact freshness as no date stamped/labeled.
Glass: Heady Topper Stemless Glass
Very excited to try this one and thanks to BA MaltyLareau (Dave) for getting this out to me to sample. This is the one that I think might end up right there w/ Double Sunshine and Heady Topper.
Pours a golden in color w/ a 1 finger white head that produces medium amounts of sticky lacing. Aromas of heavy pear, mandarin orange, pineapple, and mild pine. The flavor was of big pear/pear juice up front, leading into pineapple/mango/melon, and finishes w/ very mild resinous bitterness (almost non-existent). Medium bodied and finishes very clean and juicy. High drinkability on this one due to the juiciness, very refreshing.
Overall/Verdict, awesome, extra juicy DIPA from this tiny brewery.  Very narrowly over Double Sunshine the best DIPA I have ever had.  This beer lived up to my expectations and is a notch above Double Sunshine. Despite being similar to Heady in my scoring this beer is quite the different animal, where Heady is a dry grapefruit bomb this is a juicier pear bomb. In the end, this single hopped beer really showcased the massive pear flavor that can be derived from Mosaic hops. 1,250 charactersmikeyv35, May 26, 2013

It wasn't more than a few weeks ago that I heard about TG as their imperial stout, Assassin was hitting Madison. I am always a sucker for high alcohol, special release stouts so I picked up a bottle and researched this brewery that I previously knew nothing about. It wasn't more than a couple of days later that I had the opportunity to get a bottle of Sosus. About two weeks after that I finally drank it and was very, very impressed. 
Brewed with a single hop (Mosaic), Sosus smells and tastes like an IPA should taste. It is bitter, citrusy, floral and piney but it is not overpowering. At 8% abv, it is strong enough to suit my taste for big beers but not so strong that it can't be a summer sipper. 
I am not sure if I can pick up another bottle of this in Madison but I am certainly going to try! 871 charactersmjpolzin, May 19, 2013

4.53/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 22 oz bottle from the fridge into my Duvel tulip. Though I have packed up all of my plates, dishes, and cups for my upcoming move, I still have eight tulips in my cupboards to choose from. Priorities.
A: Pours a really nice golden orange color with a finger's worth of white head that fades gradually to a soapy halo along the sides of the glass with even fewer remnants as a film. With the higher ABV, the lack of head retention isn't a surprise.
S: Hit with mango and pineapple right up front. A hint of weed mixed in there that asserts itself even more after I picked up on it. The more I smell it, the more dank it seems. 
T: A lot of those tropical fruits I was picking up in the nose are making their presence known on the palate. A ton of the same mango and pineapple juiciness. Wow.
M: For a beer with this ABV, this drinks like a much lighter brew. The carbonation is spot-on and there is no drying effect like the one I get from other more bitter IPAs. Very well done.
O: Though I have only had three Toppling Goliath beers, it isn't a stretch of the imagination to think that these guys could be the next big thing. Having been spoiled with both San Diego and Vermont beers based on my connections to both coasts, this could be a great substitute for the guys in the middle. 1,302 charactersAndrew61923, May 15, 2013

Thanks for opening this with me, VaTechHopHead!
Clear, bright, vibrant dark orange. Moderately-sized white head of large bubbles. Ribbons and irregular lines of lacing down the glass. Very pretty IPA.
Incredible aroma, and my favorite aspect of this beer. If I didn't know any better, I would suggest this was definitely brewed with Nelson hops, and perhaps some Citra. Apparently, this is a Mosaic-hopped DIPA, and I am a fan. Grapefruit, sweet cracker, juicy citrus, and a bit of dank. An incredibly, hop-forward, succulent, juicy, hop experience.
The flavor is similar to the aroma with lots of accompanying bitterness as well. The juicy and bitter citrus notes combine very nicely with the bold bitterness. Some sweet Animal Cracker cookie sweetness complements as well. 
Medium to near-full bodied for the style with moderate carbonation. Crisp and clean flavors.
This one goes down easy. This is a delicious IPA that rivals the best San Diego puts out. 978 charactersehammond1, May 12, 2013

3.9/5  rDev -13.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Picked up a bottle of this beer, reportedly bottled a bit over a week ago, in one of my periodic cross-border pillages into Wisconsin. Great having two states' distribution within 25 minutes of home! 22 oz. bottle split with my wife. 
First, very cool, mosaic-like bottle art. Second, the pour is a dark yellow that is unclear; very like when you wiz on the verge of dehydration. Nose is 4/5ths full of grapefruit & fruit: nice, but I didn't touch nirvana. 
Sosus tastes like liquified Hawaiin Sweet Bread, which, I'll confess, is a staple in my bread drawer. Tons of light sweetbread appears right away & I fear for the the "IPA" label, but then the hops rappel in to save the style description. A floral bouquet is backed by a whap of citrus & pine. Bitterness is an afterthought, but shows. The best part of the beer is the hop sap that oozes into all the cracks in my oral orifice & sticks all over the place. Drinkability is high. My 11 ounces is already more than half gone. 
This is a very good IIPA. We're already planning a camping trip to southeastern Minnesota this summer, with a layover at Toppling Goliath. Looking forward to trying more. 1,155 charactersmaximum12, May 11, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Thanks to Nick Wade for the bottle. Arrived on my doorstep today and drinking it tonight while fresh. Bright gold with light haze, topped with a white foam that has decent retention. On the lighter side of color for a double IPA. The aroma has a blast of citrus hop freshness with a strong grapefruit vibe and hints of sweetness. Very hop focused yet clean, there is just a touch of dank twang that really finishes off the smell and makes it oh so inviting. 
The taste is everything you'd expect from the smell, intense citrus hops with a crisp melon and mango-like sweetness. Slightly resiny, but finishes nice and clean with a decent bitterness. The beer itself reminds me of Alpine Nelson yet is a bit stronger/sweeter, and the Mosaic hop doesn't seem quite as piney. Medium body, spot on carbonation. 
I've been reading that this stacks up with San Diego style IPA's like Alpine and I can attest that it's true. It's one of those beers I could smell all day long, if only I had more than one bottle. I'd say this beer is worthy of the hype it's going to receive, but only if it's consumed very fresh. This is one of those IPA's that won't be nearly the same in a month. 1,175 charactersbennetj17, May 07, 2013

White head. Color is a clear vibrant golden orange.
Flavors are dank hops. So fresh and clean. A bit of onion flavor, but not in the bad way. Tons of fresh citrus fruit. Mangoes, oranges, and clementines all show. Hardly any malt shows, which is awesome!
Mouthfeel: Bitter, but not overwhelming. Medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Ends fairly clean; not overly sticky like most. 
Overall, this is one crazy good iipa. So dank, hoppy, and fruity. Everything one could ask for. Get some of this now, while it is fresh! TG keeps on killin' it! Nice work guys! 622 charactersmothman, May 07, 2013

Smelled pine, citrus, and maybe honey wine. I can't say I know what honey wine smells like but I get both the notes of honey and notes wine that seem to come together! Wow! 
I taste some citrus but what I really notice is the biscuity taste. The beer is hardly bitter, primarily sweet. It like a honey biscuit. Its hoppy for sure! I expected it to be bitter, but this one really caught me off guard. Not sure what the ABV is but there is some subtle heat as the beer warms up.
Seriously...if you see this beer, pick it up. Probably one of the best double IPA's I tasted. It's very unique in it's own way (considering the number of Double IPA's I have tasted). I know I don't have a lot of word to say, but I will say this...I wished I picked up more than one bottle. 866 charactersBenish, May 06, 2013
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bomber from the 2013 bottling aka super fresh- probably one week old, poured into a FFF teku and quaffed with a friend on 5/5/2013.
Aroma: Holy shit. This beer is full of citrus, pine and floral hoppiness. No question about it, this is awesome. Tons of grapefruit with a smattering of pine and floral scents. I also even smell some honey'd biscuits. The nose is super strong and complex. Excellent! 
Colour: Clear, light amber body that pours with a thick 3cm head in my Teku glass. Awesome. It leaves a TON of lacing. It's probably the most laced up beer I've had in the last 3 months. Excellent. It's also got a thick white film and collar on top of the brew. Its certainly an appeziting beer.
Flavour: This is where the money is. Tons of grapefruit, orange zest, pine cones and floral scents up front. There's also the sweet honey maltiness. If there's one beer that definitely has honey biscuits, this is it. Lots of toffee, honey and breadiness. This is a sensory overload of different hoppiness and maltiness. Excellent. 
Mouthfeel: Thicker medium bodied brew. Excellent carbonation! Smooth, resinous finish that's strangely dry and refreshing at the same time. Aftertaste is full of citrus and honey, more so than the pine and floral hoppiness. Awesome. 
Overall: Holy shit, this could be one of the best DIPAs I've had in a while. We drank this after an Enjoy By 5.17.13 and this is definitely heads and tails above the Enjoy By. It's truly an excellent, complex brew that is a pleasure to quaff. No question about it, Toppling Goliath is the real deal.
Re-review; 650ml bottle of the first release of the bottle since Mike left. Served in a TG snifter 5/6/2015.
Lighter golden-yellow body, hazy, half finger white head, not much retention, thin collar, splotches of lacing. Smells primarily of sweet citrus, plenty of caramel, a fair bit of resin. Not as interesting as it used to be, to be honest. Flavour is primarily caramel, bitter resin, a bit of citrus and grapefruit, mild booziness. It does not deliver the trademark juiciness that TG has become known for, quite disappointing. Mouthfeel is medium, good carbonation, although quite bitter on the finish with a fair bit of pine. Overall, a drastic change when I compare my tasting notes to the one I wrote above, 2 years ago. They have a long road ahead to getting back to where they were when Mike Saboe was brewmaster. 2,398 charactersStevedore, May 06, 2013

4.96/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5A - Pours a light, cloudy peach/orange color into my chalice. A nice white finger of head disappears quickly and leaves behind some lacing. 
S - The scent is lovely citrus and passion fruit, peaches, pineapples and mangoes. The Mosaic hop has an incredible fruitiness to it. More so than Citra IMO.
T - Absolutely fantastic fruits in the taste is more of the same citrus and passion fruit, peaches, pineapples and mangoes. A bit of slight grapefruit and pine bitter, malt in the finish. 
M - Zippy carbonation with oily hop residue left on the tongue. 
This is my third offering from TG and it is just as good as the others were. Very happy to have this sent up to WI to try. I bought 2 bottles, wish I would have grabbed 2 more.
2017 Update. I have had this in bottles over the past two years and it continues to be a favorite of mine. I will always buy it when I see it. 877 charactersRi0, May 05, 2013
