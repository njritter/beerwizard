However! - this all starts well, looks the black n tan part, loads of vanilla and roasts on the nose, but the flavour lacks complexity, and the barrel aged component is sadly missing. Really quite roasty and not mellow. It's almost like it needs more time in the can.
And it costs a bomb and is in a reaaaaaly big can for such a high ABV beer and I don; thave anyone to share it with tonight... 490 charactersheygeebee, Jun 08, 2017

A- Opaque black. Brown head is fairly dense with great retention. Legs drizzle down the glass after a nice swirl, and delicate lacing lines the glass.
S- "Nosefeel" of burning alcohol up front. Roasted/burnt marshmallow. Chocolate. Woody and roasted barley.
T- Roast, burnt s'mores, and woody. 
M- Full body, chewy. Roast and  burnt wood astringency lingers, yet completes with a relatively clean finish. 
O- Ten FIDY already has my top marks, this just ramps up the depth and intensity. This can is definitely to be shared. 565 charactersBWED, Jun 06, 2017

Review #1375
The beer poured a thick and viscous, absolute pitch black. A small, fizzy, burnt sienna crown topped the liquid and quickly fell to a frothy collar. Some dots and streaks of lacing trickled down the glass after each sip.
The nose was really big and bold. Loads of roasted malts. Huge smoky presence. Peat smoked malts perhaps. Somewhat fudgey. Nice balance between the roast and sweetness. Moderately boozy. Touch of bourbon. Super complex and intense yet still very well balanced. The smooth bourbon notes came forth as the beer warmed.
The flavor profile was somewhat similar to the nose but much boozier and rougher around the edges. Huge roasted malt presence up front. Very char-like. The alcohol hit hard mid palate and was very raw and aggressive. Big oaky barrel notes. Not sure I would peg this for bourbon barrels however. Burnt espresso was noticeable as well. More roast and booze on the back end and the finish. Ashy notes lingered after the swallow. Like the aroma, the flavor profile smoothed out a bit with time, and the bourbon notes came forth. Some rich dark chocolate was also noticeable.
Big, thick, chewy mouthfeel. Creamy and viscous. On the palate, the liquid turned bubbly and lighter than it seemed initially. Slick and frothy. Fantastic.
Ten FIDY Bourbon Barrel Aged is a whopper of a beer with a loads of complexity in the nose and big roasty, boozy notes in the flavor profile. This definitely seemed a lot more raw and unrefined than your typical barrel-aged imperial stout. That said, I would definitely recommend putting some age on this and splitting it with another friend or two. 1,770 charactersDamian, May 31, 2017

It's May, and the canning date is November.
Nice pour. Rich, opaque chocolate in a Stone RIS glass with a 3F head that lasted a while. This is the way I like my beers to look.
Deep chocolate, roasted malt aroma.
Liquid candy bar taste. Layered flavor. Indicative of expert brewing. Peanut-chocolate.
Sweet, which shows up in the aroma with warming.
Roasted malt, with a good bitter finish.
Ivy League Imperial stout. Right there at the top of the graduating class. 500 charactersbrureview, May 28, 2017

19.2oz stovepipe can served in a large snifter. Canned on 11/04/16. "Rum Ham! I'm sorry!"
Pours black with no head. Smell is bourbon -- vanilla, chocolate and roast, yeast. Smells like a nice standard bourbon barrel aged stout.
Taste is much the same. Roasty, chocolatey, vanilla and booze, not a lot to say about it, but it's good.
Mouthfeel is thick, not quite syrupy, smooth and slick. Overall, good beer. 422 characterssnaotheus, May 22, 2017

4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a stovepipe can to a snifter. Canned October 15, 2015, "Drink by Spring" written on the bottom of the can.
A-The beer pours heavily with a dense, walnut-brown head. The foam is a finger tall at first but fades quickly to a thin cap and then to nothing at all. The liquid beneath is nearly black and opaque.
S-Despite spending some time in my cellar, aka my closet, there is still a lotta whiskey to be sniffed. The aroma is oak-heavy with brown caramel, molasses, butterscotch, some baker's chocolate, and a good bit of warmth from the alcohol. More whiskey forward than many and not as bitter as non-BA Ten Fidy.
T-The taste is still heavy on the barrel, but it is smoother and creamier than the smell. Baker's chocolate, molasses, oak, caramel, even some citrus flavors lurking in there. All with a vanilla and marshmallow cream note. Sweetness is moderate and alcohol is obvious but well-integrated. Delicious.
M-The body is medium to full in heft with a light, fine carbonation. Enjoyable and well paired to the style.
O-The multiple BA Ten Fidy beers have always been impressive and this particular can was no exception. I am surprised at how much whiskey comes through and I really appreciate how the beer is not overly sweet. Bravo. 1,249 charactersspoony, May 12, 2017

After each sip, thick love oozes down the side of the glass. Some nice bourbon and chocolate nose but it doesn't explode out of the glass. Text book BB aged imperial stout flavors -- nice balance of bourbon, oak, vanilla, molasses, and a bit of chocolate.  Mouth feel is pure silk -- so smooth. I see a few other reviews mention booziness, but I get very little and considering the 12.9, may fall down the steps after typing this review.  The punch is there, but I don't taste it -- maybe because my can is about 6 months old? 
Bottom line - this is a super smooth tasty BB Imperial Stout. Not sure that its taking us anywhere we haven't been before, but the craft in what it does is excellent. World-class rating is well-earned - especially for a beer that doesn't require trading your first born to obtain.  Mad props to the folks at Oskar.
As a side note, my wife (not a beer person) thinks this should be poured over ice cream  - guess I need to obtain another can. 1,060 characters11-52_4hops, May 07, 2017

Aroma: bourbon and fudge; like a boozy chocolate holiday cake. 
Flavor: delicious! The bourbon is at the forefront with plenty of fudge to balance it out. There is no alcoholic heat, but alcohol is present. Sipping this slowly starts to numb your tongue. Late in the finish – more as an aftertaste – you get some of the dark roasted malts. 
Mouthfeel: light-heavy. Thick and chewy, but a wee-tad on the light side for my preference given the style. 
Overall: this exceeded my expectations, and is a vast improvement over the standard Ten Fidy. Great flavor, great balance. This is worthwhile. 762 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Apr 14, 2017

4.44/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is such a good-looking BBA stout! When first poured, the head is dark brown and fluffy. It slowly fades into a more khaki-colored head that keeps a thin layer on top of the beer for a long time. Initially, there was very little lacing, just thick legs with a gritty, sugary look, but as it settles (or warmed), the head began sticking to the glass better.
The smell is huge chocolate -- all dark chocolate and fudge and brownies. As it warms up, more oak and bourbon start to make themselves known. The malted grain follows shortly after.
The flavor also has tons of chocolate, but it's more balanced with the oak and bourbon and roasted grains. The base stout's bitterness is almost perfectly balanced against the sweetness from the bourbon-barrel aging.
Mouthfeel is also excellent. It's smooth and creamy, and while I can notice the alcohol, it more of a nice warming sensation rather than the burning that sometimes happens with a 12-13% beer. It's dense and full and heavy, but there's enough carbonation tingle to keep it lively.
This beer is living up to the hype. The base Ten Fidy is an amazing non-BA RIS. BA Ten Fidy ascends to a whole new level. This beer will give BCBS a run for its money. 1,212 charactersccg, Apr 10, 2017

Pours black with a big fluffy dark mocha head that falls leaving nice thick retention and solid lacing. The aromas are chocolate forward. Lots of milk chocolate. Lots of malts. Subtle hints of vanilla. The bourbon aromas are balanced and blend well with everything. The flavors bold, rich and balanced. Lots of cocoa and milk chocolate leading the way followed by some sweet bourbon. Strong malt backbone. Mild warmth, but the alcohol basically goes completely unnoticed. This one is dangerously drinkable. It doesn't drink as big as it is. Mouthfeel is great. It's full-bodied with lower carbonation. It's very creamy, velvety, fluffy and smooth. 
This is a great stout. Even though I can't say it's the best barrel-aged stout I've ever had personally, I still love it and consider it a top notch stout. I have zero complaints. It's worthy of the praise that it receives. I am blown away by how easy it is to drink. This is a very deceptive brew. The craftsmanship is very impressive. Highly enjoyable stuff. Well done. 1,072 charactersBB1313, Apr 06, 2017

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours thick and viscous that forms a two inch khaki head that quickly dissipates and leaves a thin layer of khaki head on the beer.  Smell is rather divine with notes of chocolate predominating and slight vanilla barrel notes.  The woodsy barrel note is very balanced and subsumed.  Regular 1050 is an amazing stout, and the barrel aging on this beer definitely takes it a step up.  Somewhat sweet on the front end with notes of dark chocolate and followed by a woodsy vanillaish bourbon back end.  You also get some hop notes in this beer that stand out, which is rare for stouts of this type.  The mouthfeel is just about perfect but has a touch too much carbonation despite being silky smooth.  Overall this beer is excellent as is but I can see how it would improve with time as the hop notes die away.  This will remove some of the bitterness of the beer and let the underlying sweet creaminess come to the forefront.  Guess it is going to be a little while before I have another one of these! 998 charactersAmguerra305, Apr 04, 2017

S - smell creeps up on ya. Starts smooth with sambuca and gentle vanilla, then gets stronger and stronger. Put on the brakes! It keeps coming! Jesus take the wheel! Rich bourbon and heavy oak pound the senses. Dark chocolate smooths out all the sharp corners and rough edges. 
T - taste follows the nose with an incredibly smooth and balanced blend of barrel, bourbon, and barley. One thing I always liked about Ten Fidy was how smooth and velvety it is. There are hops in typical RIS fashion, but they're not overpowering. They're not grassy and green. They contribute to the backbone of this beer. The BA version is no different, but with an added bourbon barrel element to the mix. Decadent vanilla bean and molasses. Sweet, brown sugary caramel. Retains all the flavors from inside the barrel without any alcohol bite or burn. Toasted wood chips and maybe even a bit of maple on the finish. 
F - full and silky. Carbonation is a bit on the high side and this will foam if you swish it, but it is otherwise hearty and fulfilling. A meal in a can. 
O - well done. Takes everything we know and love about Ten Fidy and only adds to it. Brilliant bourbon flavor and chocolately dessert deliciousness. Clicking it at 12.9%, I would be dead if I hadn't checked the can and instead drank 4 of these like I wanted to. Criminally smooth. 1,546 charactersagreenman19, Mar 26, 2017

One of the most beautiful stouts I've ever seen - this pours a THICK motor oil, inky opaque body with a decent sized brown head that reduces to leave a ring of retention and spotty lacing. Perfect 5 for looks.
Aromas are fantastic - chocolate, vanilla, bourbon. On the tongue is a similar flavor profile... chocolate and roasty malt with vanilla and bourbon on the aftertaste. Finish is roasty, toasty, delicious. THICK mouthfeel, just what I want in a BA stout with medium low carbonation. 
This is one hell of a stout. If you want to try a barrel aged stout that's thick as motor oil,  will kick your ass while being decadently balanced and rich.. this is the one for you. 721 charactersgcamparone, Mar 22, 2017

Smells of bourbon, roasted malts, caramel, coffee, and brown sugar. Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. The dark chocolate finishes the brew and lingers long afterwards. Feel is thick and heavy. It is noticeably boozy with a slight alcohol burn throughout that doesn't take away much from the brew. Overall it's quite lovely, a slow sipper that will warm the bones on a cold, wintery day. 526 charactersRiff, Mar 12, 2017

32oz growler poured into a snifter
presumably most recent vintage although not specified
A: Pours like motor oil, jet black and viscous.  Less than half a fingers width of dark mocha head tops it off.  Head dissipates at a moderate rate and leaves a few small patches of lacing.  4.5
S: Aroma is amazing, with huge roasty notes and huge Barrel notes.  Tons of charred oak and bourbony vanilla.  Bit of booze, subtle subtle semi-sweet Cocoa.  Just killer. 4.75
T: Taste doesn't live up to the nose but it's still good.  Huge roasty and char notes persist, but the bourbon characters from the nose don't translate as well in the taste as they did in the aroma.  There are Barrel characters but it's mostly boozy, somewhat astringent. 4.25
M/D: Mouthfeel is full bodied, almost chewy. Carbonation is appropriate.  It's a huge beer but drinkability remains good all things considered.  4.25
O: It's an excellent beer.  The aroma is divine, the taste doesn't quite live up but very enjoyable nonetheless.  The price tag though, ouch. 4.5 1,074 characterszac16125, Mar 12, 2017

Tried to get my hands on it in Florida but I didn't succeed. 
Then I came home to Sweden to the release in March 3, 2017 - just a few days after my arrival - This is happiness!   :)
Of course a totally black beer as always with Ten Fidy, with a two finger high, creamy, brown head that leaves lacing on the glass (#Spigelau stout glass). 
Nose: Ahhhhh... Bourbon, coffee, roasted malt, brown sugar, vanilla, caramel malt, oak and (I could go on forever) whipped cream. 
Taste: It's so smooth! Coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, brown sugar, vanilla, milk chocolate, roasted malt, lactose and dark bread. 
Mouth: Full body. Light carbonated. Smooth and creamy. Even more after it warms up! Dry an sweet. The hig ABV of 12.9% is ingeniously hidden! 
Oh, this is love... I would like to buy a lot of this beer. To bad I'm not a millionaire! 936 characterscraftbeersweden, Mar 12, 2017

Pours pitch black with a lovely chocolate head that laces itself around the glass. Nearly a perfect look for a stout.
Smell is of roasted chocolate, hickory spice, subtle vanilla and a hint of coffee. Can't pick up very much of the barrel.
Taste is excellent. More coffee and vanilla combined with rich chocolate and lactose. A hint of bourbon to complement a lovely fudge and oak flavor. 
Feel is ridiculous as expected. Thick and chewy with very little carbonation. The lingering head is a great addition to the feel of the beer.
Overall this was such a treat to have. The only criticism I could come up with is the lack of the bourbon but besides that it is nearly a perfect beer especially the look and feel of it. 771 charactersaoampm, Mar 06, 2017

I'm Sorry!" so big props for quoting one of my favorite episodes of one of my favorite shows!  This is my first time with the BA version, being accustomed to the regular, and it rocks on all counts.  Just as sick and oily as I would have expected from a Ten Fidy, and a lot more head than I would have expected from a barrel aged stout.  But man, does that bourbon kick you fast and hard!  Definitely not a smooth imperial stout, but lots of chocolate, molasses, and hazelnuts on the nose, plus rich malts, vanilla, and just a hint of something bitter/sour in the finish.  Gotta say, I'm almost spoiled for the original with this one. 700 charactersjmasher85, Mar 02, 2017

Smell - I can't say anything stands out in the nose. However, it is a well balanced boozy nose. 
Taste - The taste begins with boozy chocolate malts, maraschino cherries, and rich fudge.  The booze is strong, but is far from hot. Despite all of tge sweet notes, the beer is not overly sweet. 
Mouthfeel - The feel is smooth, velvety, and even has a nice flow of carbonation. 
Overall - This is an example of a beer that does not try to do too much. What it does, it does well. 558 charactersJohnnyHopps, Feb 20, 2017

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, caramel, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with light smoke, charcoal, coconut, raisin, fig, cherry, date, and roast/oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warms, but really minimal. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, caramel, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with light smoke, charcoal, coconut, raisin, fig, cherry, date, and roast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate roast/char bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, caramel, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, dark bread, smoke, light char/dark fruit, and roast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from roast bitterness/oak spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden; a mild warmth lingering after the finish, with minimal barrel booziness. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged Russian imperial stout! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Very rich, complex, and well balanced; great barrel presence, without being boozy or overly tannic/drying. A highly enjoyable offering. 2,223 characterssuperspak, Feb 18, 2017

4.26/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25L- Super dark and thick with a bit of a tan head. Leaves some lacing around the glass.
S- Not picking up much. Some bourbon and a little dark fruit. 
T- Roasted malts, a fair amount of bourbon. Oak is slightly harsh. I would like slightly more of a chocolate base to balance the roasty bitterness. 
F- Very thick, chewable. Slightly astringent, otherwise it might be a 5. 
O- Pretty solid BA stout if you like roasted malt flavor. It's not mind-blowing though. 464 charactersZoomslowik, Feb 17, 2017

Taste is bourbon, wood, smoke, and roasted cherries. Roasty malts, and it's bitter without being too astringent.  Viscous,  and sticky, vanilla burnt. Burn of the alcohol is here, although not exactly "boozy."
Not sweet. A chewy woody RIS. Anise, chocolate, and the bourbon all come on strong as it warms. Very woody. The Ten Fidy reputation precedes this, and overall quite good. Not the most affordable; if you don't like bourbon BBA, stay away as this is the overall takeaway for sure. 656 charactersRogerlb, Feb 13, 2017

4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a growler into a MadTree snifter. The pour is black and fairly viscous with about a finger of dark brown head that quickly dissipates. On the nose I get dark chocolate, roasted malt, toasted oak, and bourbon.
Full body with a lush flavor and a creamy feel. Big flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla unfold over the palate one-by-one. You know that alcohol is there, but it's very well-hidden by all those flavors and what alcohol there is simply adds richness to the flavor.
I guess this is no longer ``Ted Fidy'' and is now ``Twelve nidy''. It's one of those beers that really tests your will-power. It tastes so good you are tempted to take huge gulps when you know you should sip it and savor it. Thanks to the Oscar Blues rep for bringing a keg of this to Party Town in Florence, KY for Friday Night Flights and letting us each take some home. 880 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Feb 13, 2017

Date: Nov-3-2016 Make Mordor great again
A:
Pours an insanely thick pitch black reminiscent of oil
with 3 fingers of brown head  that droops to a half inch and then a film. Some speckled lacing, decent retention especially considering the ABV. (4)
S:
The whole range of roasty malt and bourbony smoothness. Smooth woody vanilla, molasses, hard water, whiskey, oak, leather, smoke, brown sugar.
 (4.5)
T:
Wowee! Rich, thick woody-sweet malt with coffee, cocoa and charsome on the whole. It is so together it is hard to describe.
 (4.75)
M:
Velvety and warming with a lingering charred feel that doesn't verge into astringency. Full bodied with medium plus carbonation.
(4.5)
O:
Excellent beer. This one is great and made for sipping in a snowstorm.
It pours about as viscous as could be and sports a very nice head for a 12% monster. The aroma and flavor are pretty much exactly what a BA stout should be, in my opinion. There is a perfect balance between the sweet, mellow barrel character and the thick, also mellow, malt profile. It is good to the point that it all forms a unifed front that is proving hard for me to tease apart. Very sweet but between the charred malt and the booze it is all kept in check. 
This is a fabulous beer and is one I would gladly have again. (4.5) 1,299 charactersTheDoctor, Feb 05, 2017

Beer poured black as night with a two finger brown head that has some very good life to it.
Nose is delightful; light bourbon, vanilla, a touch of chocolate, and oak.
Taste is very harmonious with the roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate, and a near perfect touch of bourbon.
Feel is medium to full bodied and very smooth.
Overall this is a well crafted beer that is ready to drink now!  Seems the bourbon will fade in 6-9 months based on the flavor now.  Seek it out! 593 charactersarizcards, Feb 04, 2017

Sweet and dark chocolate, roasted nut, candied sugar, leather and ripened dark fruits combine for a complex and inviting aroma.
Smooth as silk and hot as hell and full of dark fruit, brown sugar, layered notes of chocolate and a faint nuttiness.  The alcohol is spicy, lasting and warming, but it knows its place and is never intrusive.  Medium to heavy in body, but so easy going down.  
What a dandy! 477 charactersstephens101, Feb 04, 2017

Thick and black in color and it poured thick. A small head which left quickly and I'd expect that from such a beer. The color and lacing is hard to describe other than thick, heavy and dark caramel?  Almost like a dark Irish cream. What an amazing nose. Channel need to make perfume from this. Sweet, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon. All the things growing boys love.   Nice charred oak which surprised me on the second taste with a bit of smokeyness. Very sweet with molasses and vanilla. Sampled at room temp. Finish is of a quality espresso with tons of sugar. It's one to share because of its quality and ABV. 719 characterswaterski, Jan 31, 2017

Body is full with oily-like texture and great carbonation with some light alcohol notes also perceptible.

Oh my, the pour of this is amazing.  It is dark black with a tinge of velvet.  The head is creamy and thick.  Tons of roasted malts, dark chocolate and oak comes through on the nose.  The taste is phenomenal.  Tons of chocolate come through against a thick layer of malty goodness. The barrel aging complements it perfectly as well.  The bourbon is not overpowering, but its presence is felt.  The texture is thick, but the creamy carbonation makes it go down so smoothly.
I like regular Ten Fidy, but this is on another level.  Easily my favorite BA beer to date. 604 charactersnawpnawp, Jan 19, 2017

Head is dark brown and lingers pretty well for a BA stout. Smell is bourbon, oak, char, chocolate, and dark bread. Taste starts with a rich dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and char then leads into the barrel character. Incredibly balanced. Feel is thick and chewy, but not quite as much as the base beer.

Smell is chocolate covered roasted nuts, very rich and multifaceted charred oak, nearing maple, with roasted, charred malt and spiced bourbon.
Hot hot heat hits the tongue up front, but a woodiness and nuttiness tamps it down a hair. I also get brittle toffee drizzled with chocolate and maybe some astringency of piney hops or something else. There is plenty of bourbon and brandied raisin.
Feel starts out exceptionally and surprisingly thin. Ten Fidy normally is not this way. Chalk this up to another stellar beer ruined, or at least injured, by barrels. There's almost no froth or thickness to the body anymore, except maybe a little slick chocolate syrup. It also goes down hot and finishes semi-dry, nearing semi-wet.... Okay, it gets a little thicker and frothier as it warms, improving it a tad.
I kind of just want a regular Ten Fidy now... 1,027 charactersSabtos, Jan 14, 2017

Pitch black, dark khaki reddish head, lots of lacing left behind.  Looks great.
Smells of dark currants, dark cherry, sweet molasses, some caramel, umami and soy sauce, oak, and plenty of barrel character, astringent alcohol and char are notable as well.  Unfortunately, the umami/soy notes, char, and alcohol are fairly prominent.
Tastes of milky cocoa, caramel, molasses, some umami, brown sugar, bourbon, and oak.  Unfortunately, again, the umami/broth/savory flavors are a little much.
Mouthfeel is pretty good, could definitely be a bit heavier/chewier, and I wouldn't mind less carbonation.
Pretty good, too much of that savory/umami flavor that some barrel aged stouts end up with.  Better barrel aged stouts for the price.  Honestly prefer the un-barrel aged version to this. 814 charactersbillshmeinke, Jan 11, 2017

Kangaroo Sauce.
A- Pours a full opaque black color with a 1/2 inch or more of a deep brownish-tan head that endures far longer than any BB stout to my recollection. Resilient lacing leaves tiny whispy spots behind reminiscent of chocolate clouds.
S- Rich Chocolate bourbon aroma with notes of vanilla and oak. The word that comes to mind is decadent.
T- Chocolate bourbon follows the nose with a good amount of sweetness that complements the barrel it was aged within. Dark chocolate, caramel and more vanilla. Drinkable for the ABV with almost perfect balance of beer and barrel.
M- Surprisingly the barrel did not noticeably thin the beer whatsoever. Medium-low carbonation and a full body. Velvety smooth.
O- Simply delicious, well-balanced without being boring. Good bourbon character supplementing the sweet, chocolaty, rich base. 921 charactersTNasty1126, Jan 10, 2017

A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/2 inch medium brown head that retains well before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and some faint wisps of surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves tiny clots behind.
S- Rich bourbon aroma with notes of vanilla, milk chocolate and oak.
T- Pretty bourbon-forward with a good amount of sweetness that complements the charry roast of the base beer.  Has a peppery quality that I wasn't expecting along with the usual dark chocolate, caramel and more vanilla.  Super drinkable for the ABV.
M- Pretty creamy but honestly not that much more than the base beer.  Medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- Very good, especially once you consider the price per ounce.  Could be a bit more complex but it's quite smooth and tasty. 865 charactersImmortale25, Jan 07, 2017

A: Pours a very slick and oily pitch black color. Subtle ring of khaki head around the edge. This is what a BA stout should look like.
S: First thing it straight bourbon, spirit, whiskey. Huge oak and char notes. Lots of roasted malt. Back of the nose is a little linger chocolate, vanilla, and even maple sweetness, but not much.
T: Again, big burst of roast, oak, char, bourbon up front. Middle of the mouth brings a sweet cocoa powder flavor. Finish is surprisingly bitter. 
M: Quite thick and chewy, just like it looks. Drinks a bit more than the advertised 12.9% ABV, making this a touch too boozy, but not terribly so.
O: Had the original Ten Fidy several years back now, and was never hugely impressed with it. I loved the mouthfeel, it was big and rich, but didn't have enough character to separate it from the pack. Throwing this into a barrel will obviously excite a lot of people, but unless you love regular Ten Fidy, there's not much that's extra special going on here. In the standard category of BA Imperial Stouts, this fits alongside Parabola or BA Darkness, but I would rank both of those well ahead as they're a bit less harsh, less bitter, and go down a little smoother. This is by no means a miss, and I'd gladly drink it again. It just didn't blow me away.
Recommendation: Tough to find after finally hitting distro, but I still recommend looking or trading for one if you consider yourself a stout aficionado. 1,579 charactersSparty1224, Jan 05, 2017

I missed this one the first time it hit my local craft beer store as is sold out in 2 hours. So I grabbed a pair this time while they were still available! I love ten fidy, probably one of my favorite stouts next to Hunapu and Marshall Zukov from CCB. The packaging is brilliant! 19.3 oz and advertised as a "stovepipe", so I am thinking I might need some help when imbibing this one. Pours a brilliant midnight oil (sorry Aussies) color with a light tan head. Fragrance is beautious (wow did I just say that?) Notes of coffee, caramel, vanilla and bourbon, not as boozy as Goose Island, though. Mouthfeel is thick and delicious, what do you expect from a barrel aged 10/5. I would like a bit less carbonation, but I digress. I have seen other posts that the bourbon was not very evident. I disagree I taste right from the get go along with roasted coffee, bitter dark chocolate and apricots (I know weird for a stout). Definitely a beer to split in a few goblets so you can enjoy a few without passing out. Taste improves as the stout warms up from refrigerator temperature to near room temp. If you have had a bad day or week at work this is definitely the "mind bender" to reach for. Hope to see more great things from Oscar Blues in the near future.
Heard from a rep at the store that bourbon barrel aging is just a fad, hope he is wrong cause I love the style. Sorry, I haven't posted in a quite some time but made a cross country move to Vegas and its been a rough ride. I miss my Cigar City brews so any of you CCB peeps who want to do a trade for something you can't get from the left coast hit me up!

4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Saved this to be my last beer before a planned dry January . . . we'll see how that goes, ha. I had really high hopes for this one, given its reputation. It didn't quite live up to it, at least for me . . .
The look might have been the most appealing part of this beer: black as night, with a fluffy, dense, cocoa-colored head that left a gorgeous lacing on the snifter. The smell was largely burnt coffee at the beginning, with only a hint of barrel, my first indication that I might be disappointed with the taste. Which turned out to be better than I thought, with chocolate, coffee, and toffee notes dominant. But very little bourbon, at least to my palate. (It might not have helped that I'd had a BCBW about an hour before.) Finally, the mouthfeel was thinner than I was expecting; again, I've had some real dense stouts lately, so maybe it's an unfair comparison, but even the oilcan packaging leads me to believe it's going to be much more viscous and chewy than it actually is. 
In the end, this is a very good, if not mind-blowing, beer. I guess other reviews led me to believe it was going to be more revelatory. I almost think I'd rate it higher as a non-BBA beer. As it stands, it's a solid entry into the canon. 1,227 charactersJayORear, Jan 02, 2017

One of the blackest looking stouts I've had. Lots of head on the pour and remaining lacing on the glass.
Smell is bourbon, coffee, char, oak.
Taste: On the initial sip I get huge vanilla, bourbon and coffee. As my palate gets more used to the taste, more sweet bourbon and the base of coffee, char, tobacco and vanilla are muted but delicious.
Feel: Mouth coating.
Overall: This is the classic Ten Fidy ramped up on a higher plane. The sweet bourbon and vanilla just makes this a pleasure to savor.
Glad I was able to find 3 cans: one to drink fresh; one to drink in 6 months; and the final one in a year. 620 charactersDonco, Jan 02, 2017

Look- Pours a used motor oil black with a finger of mocha colored foam. It settles to a thin ring leaving no lacing behind. 
Smell- Smooth bourbon with notes of vanilla oak and char. A little dark chocolate emerges in back. 
Taste- Silky smooth bourbon dominates with vanilla, char, oak and some dark cherry in the finish. 
Feel- Creamy, oily and smooth as silk. 
Overall- As fine as barrel aged stouts come! It's smooth on the palate and loaded with wonderful notes of oak, vanilla and some cherry. I wish I had easy access to this beer as I'd rank it with my top barrel aged stouts. I'm glad I purchased six, I'll double down next time if my timing passing through near the release affords me the opportunity. 832 charactersPrager62, Jan 02, 2017
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours an inky jet black with a fairly dense, two finger, milk chocolate colored head. It takes a few minutes for the head to settle to a sliver of a ring around the edge of the glass, and there is a little bit of spotted lacing left on the glass.
Smell is very bourbon forward. There is also chocolate fudge, some char and caramel, but they definitely take a back seat to the bourbon.
Taste is the same, but much more balanced making it very complex. The bourbon is still there along with charred oak, but it is balanced out nicely by decadent chocolate, caramel, and robust black coffee. I also get a touch of nuttiness.
Feel is on point. Full, rich, thick and velvety smooth. Really coats the entire palate.
Overall this is an excellent beer. Wonderfully complex and an excellent mouthfeel. I was worried after smelling this that it was going to be very hot, but not at all. I was thinking about aging my other one, but now I'm not sure I see any benefit. 971 charactersCNoj012, Jan 02, 2017

~ 2 months from canning date
Appearance- Pours a black color, oily body, opaque. Finger thick, dark tan colored head, frothy thick. Alcohol legs coat and stain glass with a dark film, tons of spotty head lacing as well.
Aroma- Decadent dark chocolates, rich espresso. Dessert like sweetness, toasted marshmallow, caramel, vanilla, toffee. Barrel char, oak, hints of bourbon. Dark fruits, brown sugar, slight soy.
Taste- Rich roast, espresso, molasses, rich chocolate cake. Barrel char, smoky, leather, oak. Sweet bourbon, caramel syrup, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, graham cracker, and dark fruits. Touch of earthy hops.
Feel- Full bodied, creamy and oily thick, mouth coating. Lower carbonation, slick and smooth.
Overall- Rich and roasty with wonderful dessert like qualities. Barrel characteristics seem to amplify the underlying sweet characteristics in the base beer, rather than overpower or cover up. An incredible beer to sip and let the flavors and nuances unfold. 992 charactersOrangeMen, Dec 30, 2016

Appearance - Pours black as used oil and with a cocoa colored, near two-finger width head that hangs around for a while. The head eventually dissipates, revealing a thin, broken layer of suds. Fair lacing, mostly consisting of broken lines and spotting.
Smell - Fudgy chocolate with lesser malt roast and smoke, molasses, oak and a touch of vanilla.
Taste - Follows the nose. Fudgy chocolate upfront, then a bit of nuttiness and molasses. Moderate roast and faint smokiness. Back-end delves into more barrel-influenced character; woody notes with vanilla sweetness. Light boozy bite. Finishes with the whole shebang; lingering chocolate, molasses, oak, roast, nuttiness and vanilla can all be found long after the last sip.
Mouthfeel - Full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly creamy and near syrupy texture with a sticky, slightly dry and warming finish. Definitely not suffering from the 'thinning out' that happens to some BA stouts.
Overall - Oh man, this is so much better than the regular Ten Fidy it's not even funny. Every time I try the OG, I scratch my head in disbelief at those who find it amazing; it's decent, but I can't figure out what the appeal is, and this is coming from an impy stout aficionado. But this? This is fantastic! So much of the barrel shines, while the chocolatey and fairly roasty nuances of the brew adds a wonderful compliment to the woody, boozy and sweet vanilla tones. 1,484 charactersTheSixthRing, Dec 30, 2016

Poured just as dark as the regular with a dark brown head to match. The foam subsided rather quickly. Nice legs. Nose is of light black licorice and heavy toasted malts. Bourbon is prevelant in both smell and taste. Medium boozy burn that finishes as a soft warmth. Dark chocolate base. Very thin, considering the base had such a high viscosity. Nice beer, but I think I would rather just grab a few regular Ten Fiddy. 489 charactersLloydDobler, Dec 29, 2016

The head is a dark tan xap of foam that lingers remarkably long for a barrel aged beer. The aroma is rather balanced between the stout and the barrel influences, and I find that nice. There are some cholocalety, roasty notes, with some vanilla from the barrel. The taste leans more heavily on the barrel. There is a strong bourbon presense, with a lingering alcohol burn in the finish. Very unpleasant. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a chewy texture, and mild carbonation. Overall, this beer is out of whack even for a big BA stout. The alcohol is so pourly integrated into the beer that it is hard to drink.

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black with two plus fingers of generous, motor-oil, creme head. Very foamy, with wonderful retention. Lacing is prevalent from the first sips. Aroma is huge, with notes of caramel, chocolate, roasted and toasted malts, with bourbon and barrel and oak peaking through. Absolutely delightful dark, and robust aroma. Flavor profile is smooth, and incredibly bold and robust. Notes include cocoa, caramel, roasted and toasted malts with a subtle bourbon backbone. While each note is cranked up in volume compared to most bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts, this beer remains incredibly well balanced. Each note is hit on, and hit on well. Great job. Mouth feel is every bit of bold, robust, filling, and creamy. Overall, this beer is the full package. It's robust and yet approachable across the entire board. 
Served in a 12oz snifter. 840 charactersHarrison8, Dec 28, 2016

4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Damn fine BBA stout, and I love the fact that it comes in a 16 oz. can, so you can share with friends. At 12.9% ABV, that's a necessity!  It has a slightly different bourbon profile than Founders KBS or Bell's Blacknote Stout, the 2 Michigan beers in this style that I am most familiar with. But I think that's exactly the point, and to be expected. The variations impacted by barrel aging are the be savored, instead of ranking them. I thought this had a slightly hotter bourbon profile and the alcohol has a bit more up front, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I'm going to age a couple cans and see how 6 and 12 months treats this beer. 640 charactersBreakfastStout, Dec 27, 2016

Overall: A world class barrel aged stout. Thick, rich, and lush. There is no holding back with this beer. I really enjoyed the intense barrel and it sets it apart from other barrel aged stouts. Gorgeous 690 charactersBergBeer, Dec 27, 2016

Pitch black in color and opaque with the darkest brown head you could possibly have on a beer. Chocolate, coffee and deep roasted malt are no surprise in the aroma. As the beer warms, vanilla from the barrel shows its might with light alcohol. Flavor is massively sweet and finishes with a hint of booze. A big, thick, unabashed barrel-aged stout with massive bourbon flavor but lacking a little in complexity. 444 charactersJacobob10, Dec 25, 2016

Considering I think the base beer is just a decent imperial stout, the barrel aging took this beer to another level. Disappointed I didn't grab a second can before this one sold out. Just trying to figure out how high to rank this since so many of my favorite beers are also barrel aged stouts.
Pours thick and jet-black in the glass. Mouthfeel was also thick and creamy. Nose was brownie batter. Smells like a decadent desert. Taste is brownie batter, vanilla and oak with a roasty finish. Only quibble would be that it is a tad bit harsh. I can only believe that will smooth out with time.....which makes me regret not having another to age! 661 charactersmjpolzin, Dec 25, 2016

A: Thick, black and inky. Brown head fakes its time settling. Thin sheets of lacing stick to the glass.
S: Whiskey-forward nose. Woody. Brownie batter. Hot fudge sauce. Chocolate caramel chews. Dark fudge. Darkfruit at its core. Hint of hops.
T: Deep and complex malt layers. Brownie batter, truffles, dark fudge, hot fudge sauce, double chocolate cake, hints of espresso, woody. Hop bitterness with a brief interjection. Tight darkfruits are barely noticeable as the fat and happy malt flavors romp. The barrel pulls through in a big way with an obvious whiskey presence and some woody complexities. Bourbon ball candy. Smoke and char. Drawn out finish of fudgey malt and a lot of barrel.
M: Thick, chewy, velvety, weighty. You could cut it with a knife, but it's soft and decadent in the most pleasing way. Ample carbonation has plenty of gentle lifting action.
O: A barrel aged stout lover's wet dream. This hits all the marks and then some. Short list it for sure. 1,013 charactersryan1788a5, Dec 25, 2016

A: Holy shit! Three full fingers of chocolate milk colored head. Pours very dark brown, like dark chocolate or rich coffee. Leaves multi-tiered lacing as the head dissolves. Slightly inky. Decent sheeting.
S: A good amount of Bourbon up front, beginning with Bourbon-y caramel and chocolate, giving way, slightly, for a lighter malt backbone, akin to Cheerios. As it sits, notes of char and tobacco shine through, along with faint butterscotch.
T/MF: Hmm. Not much on the first sip, but after swallowed, more toasted Cheerios, candy malt, moving into very dark toffee, verging on char. Just past bittersweet into dark chocolate territory. Slight graphite at the end.
A lot going on, but this doesn't strike me as quite as tasty as many of the better BBA stouts I've had. It is nice to find some of the lighter malt notes, though. Especially, alongside the darker ones.

Big ass can to goblet.  Kicking off the Christmas Weekend Celebrating in a big way.
LOOK:  dark dark black, Big frothy tan-brown head.  Fades to lacing.
AROMA:  lots of bourbon and brown sugar.  Toast.
TASTE: heavy roasted barley, bourbon alcohol burn in the finish that lingers well into the next sip such that it becomes a constant little heat lamp in the back of your throat.  Tar is about the only other flavor i get.  Bourbon and malt dominate.
FEEL:  very full bodied, oily thick, a touch of dryness at the end.
Really tasty.   Pretty simple beer when it comes down to it, but it has all the right flavors.  Wish I had more than 2 of these.   Also had to chuckle at the canning stamp on the bottom of the can.  "Make Mordor Great Again."
One last comment.  Oskar Blues and Sixpoint (and others) kill me with these damn cans.

A good looking brew as I swirled the glass to take in more of the aroma.
Smells basically perfect, with a strong bourbon barrel influence that has lots of vanilla, coconut, oaky notes and booze starting things off before it shifts to dark chocolate, roasted grains, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, espresso, burnt coffee and molasses. The booze is evident but blends in with the rich roasted malts and chocolate sweetness so well that it's fantastic to inhale.
Wow, tastes like it smells naturally getting better as it warms. Flavor is full of bourbon barrel notes which released coconut, oaky notes and vanilla. Again like the nose it shifts to dark chocolate, roasted grains, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, espresso, burnt coffee, bakers chocolate, roasted nuts, charred wood, brown sugar and molasses. Rich and full of coffee and chocolate, the booze adds great complexities and makes it outstanding to sip and savor. 1,073 charactersCHickman, Dec 23, 2016

Misc.: Had a canned on date, but I forgot to check; Split with my father-in-law
Had been wanting to try this one for a long time. Like the original Ten Fidy (4.30) and through in bourbon barrel-aged and I was in. Picked it up at Whole Foods in Manhattan Beach, the first time I saw it in stores. Expecting a top-20 beer all-time for me.
Poured a pitch black motor oil-like color with 1-to-2 fingers of frothy tan head. Decent spotty lacing. Very good thick retention. (Sight - 3.75)
Fricken delicious on the nose. Bourbon, toffee, caramel, milk chocolate, mocha, sugary brownie batter, vanilla (could be wishful), sweet molasses, oak (not overwhelming), chocolate milk and wet cocoa. (Smell - 3.75)
Initial thought on the taste was almost as good as the nose, but not quite as flavorful. Milk chocolate, toffee, caramel, smooth bourbon, earthy molasses, chocolate syrup, brown batter, oak (more than the nose), vanilla, espresso, mocha and chocolate milk. (Taste - 4.50)
Full body. Slick texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 5.00)
This was just unbelievable. One of the best beers I ever tried. (Overall - 4.75)

Feel: full body thick spot on carbonation.
Overall: A really good beer but I don't think the barrel adds much to the base beer. Reminds me a lot of BA expedition stout. This beer should age really well. 553 charactersMasonz223, Dec 22, 2016

Pours midnight black with three and a half fingers of mocha hued head. The dense froth fadds to a marbled splotchy haze and broad halo, imparting some beautiful lacing, particularly where the tall pillar of foam rested. 
Subtle but welcoming aromas of soft, sweet bourbon, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, brown sugar and wet oak. 
The taste begins with a delicious combination of dark chocolate and smooth vanilla laced bourbon. Fudge, caramel, roast, cooked sugar, wet oak, rolled oats and a slight nip of alcohol. This hits all the right flavor notes for my preferences and necer seems too boozey.  
Rich, full, creamy body with gentle yet present carbonation. The long decadent aftertaste is like bourbon soaked fudgey cake. 
Oscar Blues have outdone themselves. Barrel Aged Ten Fidy delivers a top tier barrel aged imperial stout on every level. One of the best stouts from a can that I've ever had, this comes highly recommended. 1,063 charactersThickNStout, Dec 21, 2016

T (4.75) - Tastes even better than it smells.  Big bold imperial stout goodness coupled with the bourbon notes.  I like Ten Fidy anyways, but this has more flavor than that.
F (4.5) - Thick and wonderful.  Fairly smooth to drink, but it's a job to drink it!

A: Pitch-black pour with a head that's just as dark. Heavy is thick with tiny little fizzy bubbles. Quite nice retention with splotchy chunks of dark, dark lacing. 
S: Huge heavy sweet caramel from the bourbon along with a ton of chocolate. Roasty as hell, great charred malt aroma. A hint of vanilla. Not much alcohol sting in the nose, surprisingly. 
T: Super sweet caramel and vanilla up front. Heavy on the milk chocolate too. A hit of alcohol burn and some of the sweetness runs out. Bittersweet chocolate on the back end with a lightly charry background. Hint of soy suace. Lingering oak in the aftertaste with touches of vanilla and caramel and chocolate.
M: Heavy, ultra-silky and oily.
O: Stellar bourbon barrel stout. Impressive. Great balance, huge bold and sweet flavors but doesn't get tiring or cloying. Mouthfeel is like liquid silk. One of the best. 891 charactersDope, Dec 19, 2016

4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52016 vintage. "Stovepipe" can served slightly chilled into a shaker pint glass.
Basically black in color with very dark brown head. It settles quickly but leaves a small bit of lace.
Aroma is sweet and boozy with bourbon and roasted malts.
Flavor is much like the  original TenFidy with bold dark roasted malt, coffee, and peat like a whiskey. It also has a bit of Scottish character. The bourbon barrel aging adds a bit of oaky vanilla.
Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth with appropriate carbonation. 
Overall a very good barrel aged stout but maybe not a balanced or refined as some others. 604 charactersGilGarp, Dec 17, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Can purchased at Oliver's Beverage in Albany, NY.
This one pours a super thick and motor-oil looking black, with an almost as dark thick fluffy head, and a little bit of lacing.
This smells utterly fantastic- deep, rich and roasty dark malts, fudgy chocolate, lots of oaky vanilla, heavy bourbon, some dark fruit sweetness, maybe some licorice, a hint of smoke,
This is up there with basically any great barrel-aged stout. The unparalleled viscosity of regular Ten Fidy carries over here, as this is just so thick and fudgy. The bourbon is strong, but does not overwhelm the very strong base beer. There's still a lot of grainy and roasty dark malt flavor here, and it provides a perfect counterpoint to the sweet dark fruitiness, and the sweet bourbon. There's some creamy vanilla too, and a hint of oak, with a wisp of smoke on the finish. This is absurdly good.
This is so thick and chewy, it really does fit that "meal in a glass" stereotype. There's a good level of carbonation for the style, not too high, but enough to prop the beer up. It's surprisingly drinkable for the heft of this- I don't get a lot of overt booziness.
This is absolutely magnificent. One of the barrel-aged stouts I've ever had. Oskar Blues should be very proud of this release. 1,263 charactersGreesyFizeek, Dec 16, 2016

4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing black in the glass with a half finger light brown head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, bourbon and hints of chocolate; bourbon dominates. Flavor is mellow dark toasted malt, milk and dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, light oak; finishes chocolately with bourbon, remarkable chocolate notes. Nice thick bodied with great creaminess. The aroma was surprisingly simple, largely due to the dominance of bourbon, but the flavor is very well balanced, with rich chocolate mixed with dark malt and bourbon at a well balanced level. The finish is fudgy and bourbony, like a bourbon infused fudge chunk. Ten Fidy is an excellent, full bodied stout, and I expected it to support barrel aging very well; this is better than expected; although bourbon forward, the underlying flavors are complex, full bodied and well integrated. This is exceptional. I was lucky to get one can of this and hope I'm as lucky next year. The can is a bit oversized for this big stout and I hope to see regular cans next time around. I'd much rather have a chance to drink this twice a year, rather than one huge can. Although it's hard to complain, it was glorious. 1,249 charactersLiquidAmber, Dec 15, 2016

In short, it's a BA Ten FIDY.  The base beer comes through with its roasted bitterness, but the barrel aging adds a sweeter note, along with a berry tartness, to bring the base a little more balance.
Same brown foamy head, little thinner than the regular, but amazingly lasting for a BA beer.
Nose of the base beer tamed by vanilla and dark berries, as well as a more cola spice note.  Alcohol is noted, as well.
Taste is an accented Ten FIDY, with most of the aspects noted in the nose.  Big roasted after-dinner coffee with that noticeable shot of whiskey.  Flavors are nice, but feel is a bit hot - almost like an unwanted cinnamon in my coffee.
Really that's the main problem I have with the beer, the feel - just a bit too hot.  If I grab a can, I may let it settle a while and give it a retry. 811 characterscjgiant, Dec 15, 2016

A monstrous looking beer. Big, deep and super slick and rich. This one smells pretty typical. Chocolate, fudge, molasses, tobacco and booze. Tastes similar. Opens sweet molasses, chocolate, cocoa and fudge. Tobacco and oak in the middle with a sticky sweet and hot finish. The feel is the best pay off this beer. Super full bodied with little to no carbonation. Very thick and oily on the palate and smooth going down. 
A great beer overall but I don't know how much better this is than the regular version. Still, worth trying. 587 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 14, 2016

4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a nice and foamy coco brown head that dissipates fairly quickly but still leaves a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is appealing. It is an opaque dark chocolate black with a nice chocolate syrup sheen to it.
The smell is phenomenal. The bourbon notes are moderate and complement the beer notes rather well. The beer notes consist of a delicious mixture of different chocolate types such as dark chocolate and chocolate syrup to create an interesting blend. There is also a nice vanilla note but that gets lost.
The taste is absolutely delicious and much better than the smell. The bourbon and vanilla notes are still there but the bourbon moves into the background while the vanilla stays the same. The chocolate is much sweeter and more closely resembles a mix of milk chocolate and chocolate syrup with a light dark roast note.
The feel is very good. It's a heavy bodied beer with light carbonation. The beer has a slight syrupiness but is much smoother with a slightly more thin feel than the regular.
Overall, a very good beer worth getting since the bourbon adds a nice note to it. 1,125 charactersHattedClassic, Dec 14, 2016

4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5I picked up a can of Oskar Blue's Bourbon Barrel Aged Ten Fidy for $11.99 at The Lager Mill.  I've always wanted to try this beer and i'm really interested to see how this one turns out, so lets see how it goes.  2016 Vintage.  Poured from a tall 1 Pint  3.2oz Stove Pipe can.  
A-  The can looks nice, it's pretty similar to the original design and it's just a little bit eye catching because the shape of the can.  It poured a dark black color that didn't change when held to the light and two fingers worth of creamy darker tan head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left some nice rings of spotty and patchy lacing behind.  This is a very nice looking beer, I have no complaints.  
S-  The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with the bourbon barrel being the first to show up and they impart some nice bourbon, vanilla and oaky aromas that show up just enough and it;s followed by the malts which impart a big chocolate and cocoa like aromas with some dark and roasted malts along with some noticeable coffee aromas.  Towards the ends there's a little more sweetness and a slight dark fruit aroma.  This beer has a great aroma, I have no complaints at all.  
T-  The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with the bourbon barrels still being the first to show up and they impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma with no single aspect sticking out the most and it's followed by the malts which impart those same big chocolate and cocoa aspects that I got in the aroma and it;s followed by all the malty aspects that I got in the aroma with no single aspect sticking out the most.  Towards the end comes a little bit of alcohol which is a little warming and it goes into a light dark fruit flavor.  On the finish, there's a lighter amount of bitterness with some booze and sweetness showing up and it has a nice chocolate and Bourbon barrel like aftertaste.  This is a great tasting beer, it's spot on for the style.  
M-  Fairly smooth, slightly warming, not too crisp, pretty creamy, on the lighter side of being full bodied with a lighter amount of medium carbonation.  The mouthfeel is very nice and it works well with beer.  
Overall I thought this was a great beer and great example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style and when it comes down to it I thought it was pretty much a text book example of the style.  This beer had nice drinkability, one glass might be the perfect amount for me, but I think I could take out the whole can.  What I like the most about this beer is how true to style it is, it has all the key aspects that I look for in a great bourbon barrel aged stout.  What I like the least about this beer is nothing, it's good just the way it is and I wouldn't change anything.  All in all I was impressed with this beer, while I think ten fidy is good Imperial stout, it's not a favorite, but the barrel aged treatment seems to really work well with the base beer and they come together to make a very tasty example of the style.  It's now my favorite Oskar Blue beer and it's a great example of the style.  Great job guys, this is one tasty beer, keep up the hard work. 3,263 charactersStoutHunter, Dec 12, 2016

Updated for the online Beer Advocate tasting.   Can dated 11/04/16 "Rum Ham! I'm Sorry!" into a tulip glass.  Pours jet black with 2 fingers of variable density brown head that had great retention and left windshield lacing.  Nose has mucho dark chocolate, some dark fruit and roastiness.  Taste matches the nose but with more barrel attributes and whiskey, less fruit, and mild coffee/bitterness on the finish.  Mouthfeel is very smooth for the ABV, light-medium body, moderate carbonation, some lingering burn from the ABV.  Overall an outstanding beer, wish I'd bought more!
Update 20170320:  After unexpectedly finding Java BA TF on tap, my birthday present...literally, I decided to open my last can as a nightcap.  Things have really balanced well, while the barrel still dominates the nose until it warms, the barrel, chocolate, and roastiness are now more equally balanced.   Mouthfeel has softened just slightly.   Rating for my palate is possibly even a bit conservative, wish I had one more in the cellar! 1,096 charactersjakecattleco, Dec 11, 2016

$12
Deep brown to black in color and opaque with no head and moderate lacing.
Nose is very much bourbon, vanilla, subtle sweetness, coffee, a bit of acetone, and a nice roasted quality.
Taste is a mix of bourbon, vanilla, coffee, hops, booze, and sweetness.
Mouthful is medium to heavy but a bit thin on the back end.  Carbonation is average.  Finish is dry.
Ten Fidy is a really solid beer.  The barrel aging adds a great character but its really hot still.  The booze note is really strong throughout.  That being said, the nose is nice as well as the taste.  I would recommend trying it but at the steep price, it makes it hard to say seek it out. 677 charactersSlack, Dec 10, 2016

4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from the epic Stovepipe can into a snifter. 
The pour is pure jet black, like waste from a paper mill that specializes in black construction paper. There's a finger of dark caramel head that sticks around for a while before settling into a brown ring that sits atop the beer. Like the hype, the lacing is real.
The aroma is great, but slightly disappointing. Lots and lots of dark roasted chocolate, some charred coffee, and a touch of caramel lead the way before the bourbon and vanilla come through like a shy dude entering a party. There's some lingering notes of toffee, molasses and booze on the back end. 
The taste though. The taste is exactly what you would expect a 12.9% BBA version of Ten Fidy to be. It's huge, it's bold, it grabs you by the balls and whispers something about getting "turnt" in your ear. Massive amounts of chocolate and roasted malts, dark roast coffee, charred leather, and molasses all backed up by the vanilla and oak flavors. The alcohol wraps the tongue in a soft blanket before being gently pulled away. 
The feel is the definition of "full-bodied". It's thick, chewy, and creamy as all hell. Very light carbonation. Just a tad sticky and syrupy but otherwise perfect. It's boozy but it's a nearly 13% ABV stout so you'd be insane to not expect that. 
Overall, this beer absolutely met my lofty expectations. Ten Fidy is already one of my all-time favorite beers, so when I heard there was a BA version I got a little excited in the zipper region of my pants. This is by far the best barrel-aged beer I've ever had. It takes a bold, massive imperial stout and somehow turns it up a notch. The flavors are rich and decadent, without ever getting too sweet, and the alcohol is always present but never over-bearing, just like a good creepy uncle. 1,793 charactersScaryEd, Dec 05, 2016

Regular ten fidy is one of the greatest RIS's ever , unfortunately the BA version does not rise to the same lofty heights. A shame but as quiet often happens the beer is more spirits than beer. 4

overall: Ten Fidy is a personal favorite and eagerly anticipated the BA version. I understand this was in barrels 8-12 months and blended. Imo, this is one bad boy that could stand >12 months and jeez, what a brew it would be. 490 characterscindyjeffsmith, Dec 04, 2016
4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Stout perfection poured into a Stone stout glass. Thick nice brown head with walled lacing and a black body rich and velvety in appearance. 
Smell is a terrific mixture of chocolate and licorice in bourbon barrels. 
Taste is big bourbon barrel notes surrounding some roasted chocolate and malts, with a rye toasted note, and a wood and vanilla liquor burn that translates into a somewhat spicy finish. After a little while some coffee hints show up. 
Feels full-bodies and has moderate carbonation. Barrel burn is present. 
What can I say. Having tried nearly all the renowned heavy-hitters of BB-Aged stouts, this is yet another world class example. If you love other 12-13% abv double stouts such as KBS and also Prairie Bomb!, this a fine in-between as far as barrel action and hop/ spice notes go. 801 charactersTBoneJones, Dec 04, 2016

Appearance: Pours jet black with a moderate amount of bubbles. Solid finger of tan head that slowly settles into a thin creamy layer. 
Smell: A roasty and rich dark malt driven aroma with a scent of chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. Dark roasted barley malt with a scent of dark chocolate, coffee, toast, smoke, biscuit, caramel, and toffee along with yeast. Barrel scent of bourbon whiskey with some vanilla, oak, and wood. Sweet scent of burnt molasses. Dark fruit hints of fig, raisin, and cherry. Also some hints of anise, leather, and tobacco. A really good roasty aroma. 
Taste: Like it smells, a very roasty and rich dark malt driven taste with notes of chocolate, coffee, and whiskey. Dark roasted malt with big notes of dark chocolate, coffee, toast, smoke, caramel, toffee, and biscuit with some yeast. Solid barrel notes of bourbon whiskey, oak, vanilla, and wood. Sweet taste of burnt molasses. Some notes of black licorice, tobacco, and leather. Dark fruit undertones of fig, raisin, cherry, and dates. A really good taste.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with  a moderate amount of carbonation. Rich, creamy, and fairly syrupy. Moderate alcohol heat. 
Overall: A great Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. Good mix of barrel and dark roast notes. 1,286 charactersMattyG85, Dec 03, 2016

4.84/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Picked up this brew today. Excited to try it out.
Appearance: Fresh pour from the can into a snifer glass. Immediately there's a rush of black gold, even giving motor oil a run for it's money! Developing as I pour is a nice, frothy brownish head that is the crown jewel to this first pour. very impressive. Head is around 3/4 inch thick!
Smell: First take on this brews atmosphere while it's still cold is a sweet, chocolate-like impression. Also detected is slight hint of bourbon. Very good combination right up front. As it gets closer to room temperature, I go in again for another round of more dark cocoa, but also involved is some hints of wood, faint vanilla, and more alcohol sweetness, some caramel and molasses.
Taste: Upon first sips while it's still chilly, I get a full hit of chocolate malts, slight hint of vanilla, and toffee. This is already a great sip and I know this brew is hiding more flavors as it settles closer to room temp. Waiting a little bit, I go in for another and I get an espresso-like flavor, some hints of bourbon, some caramel and towards the end I get a much darker taste of chocolate. Some faint vanilla and a bit tart as the flavors settle. Absolutely balanced and perfect!
Mouthfeel: Very full-bodied up front, somewhat smooth aftertaste. Medium-light carbonation. Kinda syrupy. Pretty good.
Overall: This is a great beer in the RIS category. I enjoyed the original TF, but the BA this brew just got a shot of flavor steroids. I grabbed this on sale for only $2.50 a can! Totally worth it. I would've paid 3 fold per can for this! Will totally have again and would totally recommend to a friend. Great beer to enjoy on a cold winter's night to sip and savor. Cheers! 1,712 charactersDMXLOX22, Dec 03, 2016

Pours pitch black just like the regular. The nose is largely barrel with dark fruit and chocolate. The taste follows the nose, lots of barrel with a great base beer behind it. Lots of oak and vanilla. Chocolate comes through mid palate and it finishes with that bitterness that's in the base beer. Absolutely incredible beer. 408 charactersScott17Taylor, Dec 03, 2016

It pours nearly jet black with a slight mahogany hue when held to the light.  It has nearly two fingers of creamy, mocha-colored head and lacing that slowly dissipated. It's a beautiful pour. It smells of dark roasted malt, dark coffee, caramel, chocolate, dark fruit, oak, and bourbon. It's really fragrant. What an amazing flavor:  milk chocolate, burnt coffee, vanilla, chocolate-covered cherry, and a hint of smoke. The bourbon is present throughout. You can certainly taste it but it isn't so hot as to overwhelm the other flavors.  This Stout is medium-bodied, creamy, mildly carbonated, and the 12.9% ABV is powerful but not distracting.  Overall, BBA Ten Fidy is quite an achievement.  It's hard to come by and rather expensive but worth the effort. 804 charactersMacMalt, Dec 03, 2016

3.94/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4A- One of the thickest pours I have seen to date as it rushes out of the can. Thick, dense, and a fairly long lasting head of the darkest tan color emerges as the pour finishes. Lacing is minimal. The body of the beer is thick, black and opaque in the glass.
S- All barrel on the nose with huge caramel and vanilla sweetness up front. The middle and end of the scent reveals a bit more spice and oak from the barrel, but still the barrel dominates with just a touch of malt sweetness contributing to the smell.
T- Just like the scent, the barrel dominates most of the taste profile of the beer. The caramel is toned down a bit from the scent, but the spice and oak ramps up enough to cover for it. Sweet and spicy vanilla and oak barrel notes are the entirety of the front half of the drink before the base beer malts make a slight appearance. The end of the drink is almost all spice and base malt and is fairly bitter as the beer leaves the tongue.
M- This one is very heavy and boozy, making it a slow drinker on the whole. The flavor profile and alcohol are both high and can sneak up on you if you try to drink it quickly. All in all, this is a heavyweight of a beer and really exemplifies how extreme the stout category can become.
Overall, I love regular Ten Fidy, and the BA version is a great beer as well, but it is a little different. I like the regular version because it is big, dry, and lightly bitter, while this one has somewhat of an overemphasis on the barrel. That being said, it is still a very good beer and worth a try if you are an OB fan. 1,566 charactersboilermakerbrew, Dec 02, 2016

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a pitch-black color; of course it does, this is Ten Fidy we're talking about. The head is two fingers high and dark tan in shade. Unlike quite a few barrel-aged stouts, the retention and texture of the head don't suffer that much next to the base (though it's obviously inferior in this regard). Thick rings of lacing stick to the glass. This looks wonderful by the standards of the style.
Many of Ten Fidy's base elements show up on the nose: namely dark chocolate, umami, heavy roast, licorice, slight hoppiness, and espresso. The bourbon character is...actually more reticent than I expected. It still offers nice notes of vanilla, coconut, banana, and oak though. Come to think of it, it actually offers enough barrel to allow it to coexist nicely with the monstrous base beer - it's clear this should be absolutely delicious.
And it is. The barrel shows up right at the front of the palate with vanilla and oak in tow. Letting it sit on the tongue will reveal some of the base beer's roasted malts and umami. It finishes with intense vanilla and oak, though the bourbon doesn't really offer a ton of nuance. It's more shouty than subtle. Touches of piny hops, earth, espresso, and even a bit of alcohol lurk on the aftertaste (and also serve to keep the thick, syrupy sweetness in check). Despite how incredibly intense everything is, the whole kit 'n' kaboodle works harmoniously. It's hard to explain how or why, but it just does. Some barrel-aged stouts can tire the palate - this actually manages to invite additional sips due to its complexity. This is an utterly magnificent achievement for the tastebuds, and only the mild lack of barrel nuance keeps it from earning a perfect score.
It's slightly thinner in texture compared to the base, which means it's slightly thinner than pure treacle. This still coats the mouth phenomenally, and the body still carries the flavors to the palate exceptionally well. Because of the slight hop/alcohol bite, it goes down surprisingly well for nearly 13%. Carbonation is low, obviously.
This is a top-tier barrel-aged stout. Plain and simple. It partly achieves this by dint of sheer intensity, but also because it manages to balance that intensity nicely - this beer is the equivalent of a chainsaw wielded by a neurosurgeon. Anyone who fancies a barrel-aged beer (or anyone who just likes beer) owe it to themselves to seek this out. It's a masterpiece.

Pours a dark cola brown body, nearly black, one finger thick, frothy mocha head, good retention, even bits of lacing. Smell is primarily dark fruit, bourbon, bit of oak, light vanillin, earthy and resinous hops, milk chocolate, a bit of bitter cocoa. Flavour is dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar, touch of oak, a bit less bourbon than the nose would suggest, bitter cocoa, milk chocolate, rounded out by a fair bit of earthy bitterness. Not as much coconut, vanillin, etc. that would come from the bourbon, but it's all very tasty and well integrated. Mouthfeel is full bodied, appropriately carbonated, a bit chalky on the finish. A very nice BA stout, a big format big beer that will probably need to be shared. 763 charactersStevedore, Nov 30, 2016

Aroma is complex! Chocolate, roasted malt, toasted marshmallow, molasses, and burnt wood. A little bourbon underlying, but not extremely overt. I am getting a slight metallic aroma. 
Taste is absolutely phenomenal. Mouthfeel akin to that of the best bourbon barrel stouts I've tried, or maybe just a slight bit thinner. Coffee dominates with kisses of bitter chocolate and bourbon. A nice amount of distinct charred wood. Alcohol heat definitely present, with some hop bitterness in the finish.
Overall, I like this beer substantially more than the original. It has more depth and complexity, and it surprisingly seems more rounded. I see this pairing well with a rich chocolate dessert. It gets a 95/100. 806 charactersDaverCS, Nov 28, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into my favorite Lost Abbey long stimmed tulip glass canned on 11/3/16 at close to room temperature. Pours a slick black with a massive 2 plus finger mocha head that leaves behind excellent stripes of lace and it has exceptional retention. 
Smell is coffee beans, dark chocolate, vanilla beans, char, oaky vanilla, and some warming bourbon. 
Taste follows nicely coffee and dark chocolate upfront with some char aND oaky vanilla, and some subtle bourbon in the very balanced finish. 
Mouthfeel is thick and that is surprising because it went from 10.5% ABV to 12.9% ABV and kept it's thickness, amazing retention, and the same moderate amount of life, a tad dry, and it drinks very easy for its heft.
Overall this is probably the best barrel aged stouts I habe had. Oskar Blues this is perfection! 808 charactersSawDog505, Nov 27, 2016

Deep and oily walnut black body,  filling like motor oil with a dark mocha head at first.  Lightens up to more tan and a soft creamy appearance.   Thick tall collar and simple puck, but still quite dark.  Very impressive stout. 
Large nose.   Cream sensing vanilla and hazelnuts.  Thick runny dark chocolate with a mild sweetness.  Hints a little booze but not much.  Thick sensing body and cake like flavors.  Decadent.  
Palate goes for the basics.  Tangy mineral like roast quality on first sip.  Light bodied lacking a bit of barrel aging qualities and nearly wet.  A bit fizzy body as well, which takes away from some of the flavors richness.  Delicious sensing dark chocolate and vanilla mix all over. 
Very nice take on a classic but misses some of the richness, oak, and barrel whiskey qualities that could deliver. 868 characterssmakawhat, Nov 25, 2016

Edit: 4 months later.
Pours a dark brown, almost black, with one finger of dark tan head and moderate carbonation evident.  Nose is not as hot as I remember, more marshmallows, milk chocolate, though the whiskey is there. Taste is dominated by whiskey. Thick full body and moderate carbonation.
I like this a lot; strong but worth buying for sure. 422 charactersmdfb79, Nov 23, 2016

L:    It pours pitch black with the thick, fine bubbled, tan/brown head. Engine oil consistency, zero light passing through even the pour.
S:   Heavy Bourbon barrel, vanilla, roast malt, sweet chocolate, caramel, dark chocolate.
T:  Smooth chocolatey front, followed by a bourbon punch in the mouth. Definitely pick up the vanilla, and chocolate. Also a touch of espresso.
F:  Thick, rich mouth feel. Appropriate for a how heavy the beer is.
O:  Phenomenal beer.  In my opinion, it certainly lives up to the hype. The high alcohol content is hidden well, and the great flavors from Bourbon barrel's rest on the already great beer. I really liked Ten Fido, but I love this's incarnation of it. 735 charactersDankScuba, Nov 21, 2016

A- Pours pitch black as expected with a fair amount of dark khaki head which quickly fades. 
S- Coffee, chocolate, and bourbon on the nose. 
T- An initial intense smack of bourbon heat gives way to roasted notes of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. 
M- Thick, pretty hot, but a great sipper. 
As expected, this takes regular Ten Fidy to another level. The price point is a bit high, but it is certainly worth grabbing up. 559 charactersvic21234, Nov 20, 2016

Appearance is excellent. Dark motor oil brown with a descent amount of foam head for a big BA RIS.  That foam does dissipate rather quickly though and leaves a very small amount of caramel colored foam which sticks to the glass as you drink along.  Looks great.
This is a no-nonsense BA RIS.  Great bourbon on the nose with hints of cocoa, chocolate and mild coffee.  The BA elevates the taste of regular Ten Fidy with a roasted dark malt flavor really dominating in combination with the bourbon, but it's not hot or difficult to drink.  It can be sipped but can also go down pretty quickly.  If there is a small negative, it would be that the feel is a bit thinner than expected. On the 'grand scale' of RIS, it's somewhere on the medium-to-slightly light, which was surprising for a 12.9% abv BA stout.  But do not get me wrong, overall this is exceptional and in my opinion miles ahead of the regular TenFidy.  Would gladly go out and buy more. 978 characterseifster82, Nov 20, 2016

Creamy, rich, decadent, roasty, chocolate, boozy finish which lingers long time.  Top notch.  Layered, complex, deep.  Sit back and sip.

Pour = black. The head is cute, & head doesn’t usually turn me on. That’s not…what? Let’s move on to smell, which is all the chocolate richness of the base beer plus a good zing of barrel. It appeals. 
Ten Fidy - Bourbon Barrel Aged takes the base beer & bathes it in bourbon. Massive bourbon presence up front gives way to rivulets of chocolate, alcohol heat, intense roast, hazelnuts, light vanilla. Creamy smooth - this could go down & down until you couldn’t get up. 
The barrel takes what is routinely good big stout & accents it’s good points while flattening its flaws. Excellent brew. 794 charactersmaximum12, Nov 20, 2016

4.44/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Big, bold, phenomenal beer, though not as differentiated from regular Ten Fidy as I expected.  Pours a thick, viscous, jet black that seems to absorb light and certainly lets zero through, with a beautiful, fluffy, three-finger head of chocolaty foam.  Smell is dark roasted coffee, bakers chocolate, molasses, earthy malt, licorice, brown sugar, a touch of vanilla, and so much booze.  Taste follows suit with a smooth mix of all of the above, plus caramel, dark fruits, and char.  There are bourbon notes there, but surprising subtle.  Also interesting is that despite the booze presence, the overall flavor is a bit smoother and somehow slightly more subdued than regular Ten Fidy.  Still delicious and bold, but perhaps the extra aging mellows the brew more than the bourbon barrel adds to it.  Regardless, unbelievably sippable and warming.  Feel is full-bodied, velvety, and syrupy thick, with just the right amount of boozy heat.  And I love the 19 oz. tallboy offering, as it's a perfect amount to either share with a drinking buddy or sip extremely slowly on your own. 1,077 charactersAmeriCanadian, Nov 19, 2016
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I nursed one for nearly two hours last night. It is intensely rich and choco-coffee-flavored, and actually boozier than I thought it would be after just an eight-month stint in the barrel. It's really good, and definitely doesn't seem as sweet as BCBS. I wish I could side by side it with BCBS, but no way am I going to open a can of this and bottle of that simultaneously unless I have some help drinking them. Soooo rich! I also scratch my head about them doing a Java version, because I get enough coffee personality from this already. But I'm not a huge coffee beer guy, aside from the occasional Victory at Sea.
I think the BA Ten Fidy should develop nicely over time, although cellaring canned beer is something I'm not real knowledgeable about. 752 charactersLordofWord, Nov 19, 2016

Look: beer pours out super thick and dark. Black as night in the glass with a finger of dark brown head.
Smell: Can you say bourbon! The barrel dominates this beer. Super oaky with just a hint of vanilla. Some dried fruit characteristics as well.
Taste: everything on the nose translates to the palate. Definitely has a bourbon like alcohol bite.
Feel: very thick and alcoholic but it's not the fullest bodied beer I've ever had either.
Overall(style points): not sure how to rate this one. If you like bourbon then you'll like this but it really doesn't taste like beer at all and it's missing a lot of the coffee/chocolate qualities that I like so much in stouts.  91 points. 754 charactersMikeyMcD86, Nov 19, 2016

The aroma hits of dark fruits, driven by oak character, bourbon, dark chocolate, coffee.
The flavor with sweet raisin, not entirely desserty and dominant on sweetness, but with chewy dark chocolate, caramel sweetness, charred oak, onto a roasted coffee bitterness and alcohol cleaning off the back end. The mouthfeel is chewy, but not as viscous and sticky at the base beer. Analogies to Firestone's Parabola come to mind. 522 charactersdar482, Nov 18, 2016

4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Here it is: one of the archetypal stouts, first in tanks, then in barrels, and finally in cans.  No, wait: finally in my mouth.
From the pour, it is the dark black motor oil you'd expect from Ten-Fidy.  The dark brown head is of prodigious size, with excellent retention - both well above par for a barrel aged stout. The head slowly slides down the sides of the glass, leaving behind plenty of lacing. Honestly, I'm fairly certain I've never seen a better appearance on a barrel aged stout.
Sharp and boozy bourbon is readily apparent on the nose, but that is quickly followed by the strong roast familiar to Ten-Fidy fans. Coconut, red grapes, oak, coffee; these all appear in no particular order. The more it sits, the better it smells, with notes of chocolate and pecans starting to come through.
All the flavors kind of muddle together on the palate, but it's a beautiful chaos. Barest hint of banana from the yeast; tons of chocolate and a bit of dark roast coffee from the malt, along with brown sugar and toffee; the barest touch of char; and yes, of course, plenty of bourbon bite up front, carrying oak and vanilla, and a strong bourbon finish, leaning toward coconut.
While this is (not unexpectedly) hotter in the mouth than its regular counterpart, it is no less thick and smooth. Despite the heat, you can really savor and even chew on this brew, with very little lingering heat.
I don't know that this is the best-tasting BBA stout I've ever had. I do know that it is nearly without peer in its category in terms of mouthfeel and appearance; only BCBS and Parabola can even compare. Not unexpectedly, this reminds me very much of a BBA version of Founders Imperial Stout.
Do I honestly like this beer better than BCBS? I'm leaning toward...maybe.  It's easily the best BBA stout I've had in what seems like ages; its overall package is something to be reckoned with. This is a beer I wish I had a good half dozen to visit and revisit and even age, to truly gain an appreciation for it. It's a different beast than BCBS; perhaps not quite as good in some respects, but easily its superior in others. 2,119 charactersRoguer, Nov 14, 2016

Flavors are big, with whiskey, black coffee, roasted malt and dark chocolate.  Some vanilla flavors pull through also from the barrel.  It's a full bodied brew and the 12.9% ABV is quite warming.  Nice brew, it hides the strength. 333 charactersStinkypuss, Nov 13, 2016

Pours almost black with a brownish tan head.  There are nice, soft bourbon notes on the nose along with some residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is sticky and thick.  The bourbon comes through nicely in the flavor and only gets a bit intrusive on the finish. There is a background raisin and molasses-like sweetness that blends very well with the roasty backbone. 470 characters57md, Nov 11, 2016

Dryness, caramel & baker's chocolate as this warms, slight char notes & a little woody hop sneaks in along & smoothed out Bourbon, plus vanilla & even a little coconut.

Pours thick and black, with three fingers of brown head, left no lacing.  Nose is bourbon, coffee, malt, and chocolate.  Taste follows.  Excellent mouthfeel and overall outstanding.  Relieved that it is excellent since I got a number of them and they are still on the store shelves as of this morning.  Would have preferred these be in 12oz cans due to the 12.9% ABV - and why wasn't this called Twelve-Nity?  At 12.9% ABV and 19.2oz, these are equivalent to drinking five "normal" 4.2% ABV 12oz beers.  Luckily you can take your time as the flavor improves as it warms. 619 charactersbbtkd, Nov 06, 2016

Once only available to a privileged few, this is now here for everyone willing to spend $13-$17 for a 20 Oz can . . . and it's worth every penny. 
This is the quintessential barrel aged offering. 
Beautiful aromas of roasted Barley with chocolate complimented by vanilla and bourbon. 
Appearance is thick and viscous looking. Strong khaki head displaying the beers perfect amount of carbonation.
This beer achieves the right balance of everything. Not too sweet and not too dry. Terrific barrel characteristics that don't diminish the base and an overall fantastic drinking experience. 755 charactersGOBLIN, Nov 05, 2016

Vigorous pour into Cycle snifter yields a thick, 2-finger brown head which holds about 1/2 inch as tasting proceeds. Black, opaque brew yields no light. Thick swaths of lacing circle the vessel.
Oak, char, chocolate malt, subtle coffee and bourbon. The bourbon becomes more apparent as the brew warms.
The barrel and bourbon are present throughout with a nice mix of coffee, caramel, vanilla and charred malt weaving in and out as the brew is enjoyed. The flavors are nicely enveloped within the barrel.
Full-bodied stout with base brew/oats providing a nice smooth, creamy feel. 
When you start with such a nice base brew, it seems logical to take the next step and see what marvels the barrel will provide. The added bonus here is the can. Well done. 894 charactersCaptCleveland, Nov 05, 2016

Smells of coffee, raisin/prune, and chocolate. Bourbon is definitely there. Tastes sweeter than the original, but very enjoyable overall. I'm one of those rare folks who loves bourbon, but usually prefers non-bourbon beers to their barrel-aged counterparts. This is no exception, but still excellent. 385 charactersbeerwolf72, Apr 03, 2016

It's a pretty good beer, similar to regular with some barrel character. Not sure that it's worth it though, especially compared to Bourbon County, which was a hell of a lot easier to get.
If you have to tick, tick. Otherwise, just stock up on '15 BCBS. 318 characterscultclassic89, Mar 28, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Intensity has met its match as the fabled Ten-Fidy stout takes a nice long slumber in Kentucky bourbon barrels for a transformation that set great expectations and even expounded on them in unimaginable ways.
Pouring from the can with the blackness of pitch and tar but with the consistency to put motor oil to shame, the stout patiently builds a rich and creamy mocha lather to crown the rim. Its savory and suculent scent is of espresso roast, dark chocolate, and with not-so-subtle nuances of caramel and bourbon. As its sweetness creeps onto the tongue, it does so with those chocolate-laced molasses, chocolate-covered espresso beans and caramelized brownie batter.
Without reprieve, its maltiness proceeds across middle palate laying down a trail of roasted grain, dark-roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, black-strap molasses and a host of roasting nuts. Burnt in its taste, the sweetness and marshmallow malt texture rounds off the more acrid edges of the roast and softens its effects even as the coconut, vanilla, caramel, booze and oak of the barrel come charging in late.
Lavishly full, creamy and lush, the stout is meant solely for after-dinner digestive with its decadent sweetness and silky smooth texture. Trailing coffee, chocolate and bourbon form a three-tiered taste that clings to the mouth and is slow to relax. Warming to the gullet, the stout has a long and dessert-like demeanor throughout. 1,420 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 17, 2016

S: Light boozy whiskey barrel with a trace of fruity chocolate-covered ripe banana. Low spicy alcohol aroma, and no DMS or diacetyl. No hop aroma. Cocoa begins to come through in the background as the beer warms.
T: Big waves of alcohol and whiskey barrel, but it's not hot. Very easy drinking that balances right between bitter and the sweet malts. Finishes of bittersweet chocolate with notes of fudgey pudding.
F: Medium bodied with moderately-light carbonation and mild astringency. 
O: Alarmingly easy to drink, especially while it's cooler. As it warms the alcohol comes forward considerably, but it's still soft enough to be enjoyable. A lovely brew and a real treat. 892 charactersthezach, Jan 13, 2016

poured cold from the stovepipe can to a pretentious glass company aromatic beer glass a deep dark black with a finger and a half long lasting small bubbled mahogany / mocha head Leaving a trail of lace after each sip. 
super crazy aroma within seconds - of molasses, dark cherries (?), charred oak, and dark chocolate. 
hmmm...  surprisingly medium bodied upon expecting a big syrupy barrel aged monster.  smooth, and scary good.  cocoa, dark cherries, and oak as advertised via aroma with a wee bit of smoky bourbon and tobacco.   
no way this beer should be as drinkable as it is.  top 5 or 10 beer, easy. 719 charactersrobwestcott, Jan 10, 2016

Immediately get the smell of bourbon, followed by oak, vanilla and a faint whiff of chocolate. The flavor was pretty identical to the smell, with the bourbon very prominent up front, then vanilla and very light hints of chocolate and wood. Nice sweetness, but not cloying. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy, but not hot considering the high abv. Ten Fidy has always been one of my favorite RIS's, this one takes it up a couple more notches! 514 characterstimontheroad, Dec 24, 2015

A: 1/4" wide. Great shining complexion. Subpar (~1.5 minute) retention. Good tan colour.
Opaque solid black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
Sm: Bourbon - faint vanilla, oak, marshmallow. Chocolate malt. Seems ideally sweet - not too dessert-like.
Aromatic intensity is average.
T: Chocolate malt. Near perfect sweetness. Bourbon barrel character - faint vanilla, marshmallow, supple oak. It melts neatly into the base. Balanced and enjoyable, with a dessert stout taste.
Mf: Full-bodied but not too heavy. Good heft and weight on the palate. Slightly syrupy and sticky. Good thickness. Supple and silky, with near perfect carbonation. Suits the taste nicely.
O: Quite drinkable for its high ABV. Very tasty stuff. The bourbon could be richer and there could be more intricacy, but I can't wait to get another can so I can give this beer the detailed review it deserves.
B (3.65) / GOOD
***
12.18.16: Nabbed a stovepipe can of the 2016 release in Brooklyn for $14.99. 
CAN: Canned 11/04/16. 1 pint 3.2 fl oz pull-tab can with a black and silver motif.
12.90% ABV. "Imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels."
APPEARANCE: This pours the darkest head I've probably ever seen in a stout - rich dark brown. Not the creamiest, richest, or softest looking head. Indeed, it's oddly thin, bubbles popping as it recedes within ~4 minutes, leaving no lacing in my nonic pint.
Body colour is as ink-black and opaque as they come. 
True to style, this dark appearance is eye-catching, promising a beast of a stout.
AROMA: Smells really thick. The chewy bourbon is palpable just smelling this wicked beer. Heavy thick notes of beastly dark malts and chocolate malts. Fudgy and sweet. About as robust as an aroma can be maltwise. A bit more roasted barley would help tame the sweetness.
Bourbon has soaked into the base beyond a doubt, and the bourbon is as strong in this as I've ever encountered, nailing the warmth of a virgin oak aged whisky. That said, it's a bit lacking in terms of toasted coconut if we want to nitpick. Vanillin is evident on the back end.
Suggests a monstrous brew with a noticeable alcohol warmth. No off-notes are detectable. To style, there're no overt yeasty or hoppy aromatics.
A strong aroma of high intensity.
TASTE & TEXTURE: Drips with molten fudge-like sweetness. Thick, heavy, and syrupy on the palate, with a spongey cake-like filling yet soft consistency that I'm not sure works well here. Make no mistake, this is a sipper.
Heavy chocolate malt sweetness, heavy dark malt sweetness, big emphasis on malts. The lack of balancing roasted barley is a problem, and there's not enough charred/burnt character to balance out all that dessert-like sweetness with bitterness. Coffee might help.
Bourbon is as overt in this beer as in any, but it misses the more delicate notes of bourbon - the toasted coconut, the subtle vanilla, the rich white oak - in favour of a generic bourbony flavour and concomitant warmth. 
A hint of marshmallow is there, but that's really it in terms of ornamentation in this ale. It's really a rather basic build for an imperial stout, and those familiar with the finest the style has to offer will find this comparitively simplistic. The bourbon doesn't accentuate much of anything from the base because there isn't much there to accentuate.
I guess I wanted more vivid and expressive flavours, as well as more harmony of barrel and base, texture and taste. The syrupy feel of the brew ruins its drinkability, and there isn't enough in the taste to really intrigue.
OVERALL: I remembered this being far better. It's a bit of a chore to get through when you have a full stovepipe, and it's definitely firmly in the dessert stout camp. The last vintage I had had a barrel flavour that melted seamlessly into the base and didn't have the booziness this does. I think I prefer ordinary Ten Fidy to this, and the roast that I love in Ten Fidy has somehow been removed in this barrel aged variant. Maybe more time in better selected bourbon barrels is needed, maybe they need to up the roast, maybe they should consider playing with coffee or other adjuncts. I don't mind a basic bourbon barrel stout build - it's effective when it's done well - but this just isn't up there with the paragons of the style. I'm open to trying future vintages; I think this was just an off batch.
On a different note, this is the first Oskar Blues I've had that wasn't made in the Colorado breweries, and Schlimenhaumer has contended the North Carolin(i)an fare tends to be far worse.

Pours pitch black with a half finger mocha head that retains well throughout. Sweet bourbon goodness in the nose along with some vanilla, chocolate, and cocoa nibs. The traditional flavors found in the regular Ten Fidy were amplified with the wood, bourbon and marshmallow-like notes. Overall an extremely solid beer that should be sought after wherever and whenever possible! 507 charactersCuriousMonk, Dec 18, 2015

This beer nimbly dances on the edge between being quite approachable for the style and nearly careening off the road with too much sensory overload. Yet, in the grand scheme of things, Oskar Blues pretty much nails this one with a fine balance of roasted grain flavor and sweetness nicely counterbalanced with a brown spirits edge. All aspects come across boldly yet with enough harmony that all you can do is sit, enjoy, and let a broad beam of a smile cross your face. Yes, indeedy... 703 charactersbeergoot, Nov 30, 2015

Motor oil gets tossed around as a comparison pretty losely in my opinion, but it's appropriate here. The aroma is of chocolate, bourbon, and just a bit of vanilla extract. The nose is an excellent indicator of the treat you are in store for with this brew. The mouthfeel is full. It's so damn rich and smooth. This is one of those beers that is so good, there's a brief moment of disappointment when you realize you're down to the last sip. So much wow! 552 charactersRoamingGnome, Nov 29, 2015

Pours a jet black color with a slight head that settles quickly.  Awesome aromas just before a spectacular taste.  I poured into a short snifter, so the bourbon aromas were just awesome.  Great overall flavors.  I wish I has bought more than just two. 312 charactersGregaroo, Nov 10, 2015

Big roast coffee and barrel notes.  Vanilla peaking through as well
Creamy malts with just enough bitterness to balance
Overall a really good beer - not 'trade your soul' worthy that some seem to think, but worth trying if you get the chance. 320 characterspagriley, Nov 08, 2015

S - Bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, light roast, some alcohol presence, light and subtle hints of bourbon.
T - Dark chocolate roast, vanilla, bourbon, very subtle coconut, slight smokiness, light oak, burnt toffee, toasted cocoa, and lingering dark chocolate roast with a touch of bourbon.  Some alcohol warming on the way down.  Lingering dark chocolate bitter sweetness and bourbon.
M - Full bodied, slippery, silky, a little sugary on the lips.

L: Immediately upon pouring this beer I am getting excited. Deep, deep dark pour, very thick. 1 finger of tan mocha head, fine bubbles that linger. Great lacing. No light penetrates any amount of this brew.
S: Bourbon, black licorice, SLIGHT coffee, chocolate, kind of a sweet smell.
T: Dark malts, dark fruit, cocoa powder, fudge, raisins, grain. Layers of flavor. Almost dips into Russian/Baltic flavor. Bourbon flavor lingers, filling the mouth.
F: Very thick bodied, silky smooth, carbonation is excellent for a big beer, substantial, coats the mouth. Warm but smooth big alcohol presence. Very nice flavor lingers for a long time.
O: This beer is a treat. It's got a great balance of being extremely flavorful and interesting, but also being imminently drinkable as well. My only regret is that I don't have cases of this stuff. Do yourself a favor and drink it slowly, letting it warm. Extremely relaxing and rewarding drinking experience. Oscar Blues did a great job on this beer. And I love the bold move of putting it in "Stovepipe" aluminum cans. 1,118 charactersDan_K, Nov 01, 2015

The aroma and taste are perfection. Roasty, chocolate, oak, vanilla, alcohol, coconut (in the taste). The body is medium-full. Which I have spent more with this much flavor. Also, stouts are so thick and chewy nowadays, that it's almost unfair when this comes out as good as it is. Keep it up dudes and dudettes! 417 charactersKVNBGRY, Oct 30, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75As black as beer can be. No clarity whatsoever. It produces a surprising amount of thick, frothy mocha brown head... the lace that's left behind is equally thick.
Wow. The nose delivers in a massive way. RICH fudge and chocolate liqueur... some s'more type qualities... smooth bourbon presence. 
Taste is equally impressive: cocoa powder, syrupy bourbon brownies, cappuccino flavors... it finishes with enough bourbon to keep things interesting in juxtaposition with the sweet dessert flavors... a sticky coating is left behind. And my god is it THICK. 554 charactersramay86, Oct 23, 2015

Pours like motor oil with some cocoa/dark-khaki head. Lovely lacing and oil slick-like look to the top of liquid. 5
Dark chocolate and light soy sauce, vanilla and some char, and spicy bourbon. Oaken notes pop up as I pull the glass away from my nose. 4.25
Ooohwee. Damn that's a burst of flavor. Dark chocolate bar, vanilla, and then the bourbon moves in and spice things up and gives some bite to the beer. Finish lingers like sticky tobacco.  At some point, I start perceiving some maple. 4.5
So smooth and creamy with a spicy bite and wet, bourbon-like finish. A lovely balance of beer and bourbon. 4.5
I had high expectations for this and they were met. That's a success. Damn lovely. 728 charactersONovoMexicano, Oct 22, 2015
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours pitch black. This is the darkest beer I've ever seen. There is no red hue to it whatsoever. Definite alcohol legs sticking around the side. A thin mocha foam sticks to the side of the glass. 
Smells of big vanilla, chocolate cookie dough. It has a deep, nutty, coconut like aroma to it as well. It is bourbon, candy sweetness and chocolate dominating. No ethanol at all. 
Follows the nose really well. A small tinge of alcohol hits me right away, but then waves of chocolate, cookie dough, and vanilla take over. Really nice. 
Extremely viscous and mouth coating body. 
Overall, excellent. Reminiscent of BCBS, with a slightly heavier body. Not quite the coconut and leather that Parabola has. Just an excellent barrel aged stout through and through. 760 charactersraynmoon, Oct 21, 2015

This is a damn fine barrel aged stout!  It pours thick as can be and is the consistency and color or used motor oil.  Theres a lingering dark brown head.  The smell is bourbon, roasted malts, and coffee.  The taste is bourbon barrel (increases significantly as it warms), coffee, bitter, and very roasty.  The mouthfeel is super thick and chewy.  Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and I'm so happy to have a couple squirreled away for winter. 506 characterspmoney, Oct 19, 2015
