Aroma is fantastic - lush upfront with those cab sav smells (rich dark grape) with the currants adding a nice sweetness underneath with just a hint of tart yeast for contrast. Taste starts put the opposite, very heavy on the currant flavor until the that husky oak / cab sav comes in on the mid-palate with some grape tanin & vintages barrel flavors. The lacto tartness is there but is used so well to contrast & highlight the deeper flavors that you barely notice. Finishes like dry wine with a lingering sting of tartness. Fantastic. 624 charactersajm5108, Jun 05, 2017

The aroma is red wine, woodiness from the barrel, vinegar, dark berries and some cherry juice. 
The flavor follows the nose, it's super juicy. Tons of berry and red wine flavors. It's nice and tart with a slight funkiness. It's delicious.
I would seek this out, it's a very good sour, and I'm normally not a fan of high abv sours. 389 charactersScott17Taylor, May 29, 2017

Appearance: A dark reddish brown colour with a two finger light tan head that dissipated quickly while leaving only slight lacing.
Aroma: Lots of oak, cherry, blackcurrant, grape and red wine.
Taste: Sweet-ish blackcurrant and cherries followed by sourness, oak, red wine, vinegar and light funk.
Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation.
Overall: This was just like drinking red wine with carbonation. There was no sign of the 10% ABV, and although I thought the aroma was better than the taste, both were still good. 648 characterskitch, Apr 21, 2017

Smell:  Fruity aroma.  Grape, plum, raspberry.  Not as intense as some sours.  Slight sour hint, slight vinegar.
Taste:  Tastes like a fine wine right up front.  A rush of sour fruit then comes through.  Only slight vinegar hints, but mainly sour grape, plum, and a bit of a citrus undertone.  Starts off sweet, dries out slightly.   After the soured fruit notes fade out, I'm left with flavors from the barrel aging:  slight charred oak and nuts, hints of vanilla.  Get some caramel and malt throughout.
Feel:  Medium+.  Feels thicker (syrupy) at first, then seems to thin out / flatten.
Overall:  Very good.  Russian Rive is very impressive.  How can they put out one of the best DIPAs and also have outstanding barrel aged sours?  This one was pricey, but well worth it.  $15.00 for a 375 ml bottle.  It has some champagne aspects and some flavors that resemble some Gruits that I have had in the past - maybe the earthiness of the currants contributed to this.  Very pleased with this one.  I finally crossed this one off of my Beer Bucket List. 1,216 characterssjdevel, Apr 14, 2017

Look- Pours a deep transparent mahogany color with a couple centimeters of rapidly settling off white foam. It looks like a glass of spirits. 
Smell- Red wine, wood tannins, crushed red grapes, a mild mint like spice, alcohol and mild band aid funk. 
Taste- Red wine with a slightly spicy bite, oak tannins, tart grapes and brett funk. 
Feel- Light and slick up front with a tart very dry finish. 
Overall- Another world class sour from Russian River. A palate pleasing mix of complex wine barrel with tartness and funk that isn't obnoxious. The fact it was cellared for nearly three years may have had something to do with that. Whatever the case, it's top notch! 750 charactersPrager62, Apr 11, 2017

Hazy, brownish-copper body; very thin, fizzy head. Brett funk induced aromas of dark malts, figs; spicy, peppery, pseudo-anise herbal quality; unknown berry or grape-like qualities. Sour and phenolic flavors, well-balanced; wine-like notes; some alcoholic notes; fermented cherries. Medium-heavy body; tart and biting; mostly dry, woody finish.
A powerful, flavorful wild ale that, in this aged sample, teases and tantalizes the palate with subtle suggestions of dark malts, crazed suggestions of brett funk, and mouthwatering elements of fruity tartness and oak dryness. 612 charactersbeergoot, Apr 03, 2017

Big gun smoke from the cork.
Pours with a highly fizzy, slightly tan head that starts high but dissipates quickly.  The carbonation is very evident still after 2 years.  Pour starts out a copper and turns to a deep amber.  Bubbles all over the bottom of the glass and intermittently rises up.
The smell is of what I assume to be currants as it has quite a fruity bouquet.  Definitely getting the Cab wine aroma in here, with a small amount of wood on the back end.  No alcohol aroma at 10%.  Nose is great.
The taste compliments the nose in many ways.  This beer is basically a cab, but the fruit takes over and it's not dry.  The initial flavor is like a wine, but seamlessly blends in the fruity currant flavor, and then some tangy acidity on the back end.  The sourness is very subtle.  Not really much wood that I pick up except maybe in the aftertaste.  Alcohol not present except for a little warming sensation going down.  There is a mild tobacco flavor as the beer warms but in no way is this off putting.
The mouth is full bodied with a mid level carbonation despite the highly carbed appearance.  I don't know how but this is a refreshing, thirst quenching 10% sour.  
I've been wanting to try this beer for a long time.  It did not disappoint.  This is easily the most balanced sour I've ever had.  What is crazy is how refreshing and thirst quenching this is, for a sour at 10%.  I would love to have a crack at this fresh.  However, I paid $19 for this 12.7 oz beauty.  I will certainly pay attention to events and alerts of local establishments when this comes on tap, it's hard to justify spending the $ for a bottle, but it is so good.  If you see this and have the extra $ laying around I HIGHLY recommend. 1,763 charactershaazer, Mar 03, 2017

This $20, hard to find bottle will deservedly go down as one of the most exemplary sours I've had the pleasure of consuming.  Sour, but not too sour; sweet in the beginning, dry in the finish; a bit of the Belgian yeasty funk, and packed with so much depth and complexity, it'll make your head spin!  Highlights are currants and a bit of more berry sweetness, a superb balance between oaky barrel character, yeast, & fruit.  Not going to be hard to convince myself to get another bottle someday. 539 charactersjmasher85, Mar 03, 2017

Very similar look, in that it pours what I would describe as a muddy brown.  Good amount of funk on the nose, but there was also a wood character coming through. Well balanced taste profile, with a slight tartness with a hint of sweet.  Once again, the barrel itself lets you know that it is there.  Giving the feel a boost because this is definitely a shining example of the "I cannot believe this is 10%".

This beer pours a translucent garnet amber that almost looks brownish if it isn't held up to the light. There is an extremely fizzy, one finger khaki head that dissipates almost immediately and leaves no lacing whatsoever.
Smell is very strong cabernet, oak, vinegar, cherries and other dark fruit. There is a slight hint of something else sweet almost caramelish that becomes more noticeable as the beer warms.
Taste is similar with the added layer of tobacco and some funk. Starts off slightly sweet with the dark fruit, but transitions nicely to sour funky vinegar and wine with a touch of oak.
Feel is medium, crisp and very well carbonated. The finish is extremely dry exactly like a good cabernet. Cannot believe this beer is 10% abv with how smooth and easy drinking it is.
Overall this beer is excellent. This is my second RR sour, and although I slightly prefer Supplication, this beer is still fantastic. 952 charactersCNoj012, Feb 08, 2017

Poured from the bottle into a glass.
Opaque brown/purple rust appearance with champagne bubbles throughout. 
Almost no khaki head; no lace. 
Rich cherry & red wine notes in the nose. 
Medium mouthfeel. 
Rich cherry & red wine flavors; balanced & quite tasty. Not too sweet, not too tart; extremely enjoyable. 366 charactersGuyFawkes, Jan 11, 2017

Pours with a ruby red color and translucent. There's a small off-white head that quickly fizzles out into nothing. No lacing on the glass.
Wow, the aroma is powerful and I could smell it as soon as I started to pour the beer. Massive red wine notes with cherry and vinegar. I don't think I have ever had a beer that resembles red wine in the aroma as much as this one. Fantastic! So far, this reminds me a lot of a Flanders Red or Oud Bruin.
Red wine coming through again in the flavor but that's when the heavy sourness hits you. More of that cherry too, and the vinegar really cuts through.
The biggest drawback of this beer for me is in the feel. The carbonation is fizzy and it feels a little thin. Luckily, the aromas and flavors are so strong that they mask the thin aspect of the beer really well.  No trace of the 10% ABV at all.
Thanks to Jesse for bringing this bottle from California!

4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Description: Clear with no head and deep, ruby color that reminds me of bourbon or even cola.  Smell is rich and complex with a big hit of oak and cabernet followed by some dark fruit: just as promised.  The taste unfortunately does not live up to the aroma and is instead dominated by red wine with little to no dark fruit.  As a result, it's somewhat dominated by sour flavors.  Carbonation is medium to high, which is more than expected from the appearance.  Feel is a little on the thin side.
Suggested food pairing: Sharp cheese/cheddar
If you like this beer then should also try: Red wine...I really don't have a beer to compare this to.
Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely drink it again) This one was not what I expected.  It's definitely a good and somewhat unique beer but my gripe with the sourness: overwhelmingly sour with no dark fruits or anything else to mellow it out left it feeling imbalanced.  This bottle was pretty fresh and may have benefited from some aging.  Worth trying if you get the chance but I'd suggest letting it rest a while. 1,078 charactersSHDoyle, Jan 07, 2017

Great dark ale base, but the barrel aging with chocolate, and currants really adds depth.  Touches of tobacco and cabernet seal it.  Beat out the Duchesse for my favorite sour. 249 charactersDrvitlkeyustolit80, Jan 06, 2017

4.76/5  rDev +7.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Exceptional quality sour. I typically am pretty love/hate with Russian River. I am in love with this beer. 
L: Nice hazy dark ruby brown, minimal head that fades quickly
S: Smells of red wine, oak and of course you get a funky and fruity vinegar hint to it 
T: Cherries, plums, oak, grapes and a hefty portion of sour. Not really sure what a current tastes like so, I can't judge that part of the flavor. 
F: Very smooth, full bodied, yet light. Perfectly balanced. 
This beer is very close to perfect. I've had this and supplication come off medicinal tasting in the past. But for the most part this one never fails to impress. 628 characterst0talimm0rtalz, Dec 29, 2016

Smell is peppery oak, hint of dark red wine, and grape gummies with a slight acetic twang, but overall very enticing.
Dry and tanniny, spicy and slightly acetic, the Cab Sauv is very apparent. I get that peppery oak again, with red grape, red wine, black cherry, and plum. There's a slight burn in the sourness, but it's welcome. This is very well made, and just so deep and complex. 473 charactersSabtos, Dec 21, 2016

Smell is kinda musty, is a good, game-animal kind of way. Red fruits, fruitcake.
Flavor is sweet, sour, slightly bitter, salty. Very, very complex. Sweetness from cherry-plum flavors. Sour notes from grapefruit rind. Bitterness of licorice & molasses & iron. Salty like... vegemite? Hard to place. Good though.
Mouthfeel is moderate, lighter on its feet than one might expect from the color and the depth of flavor.
Finish is nice - bitter depth. Definitely a beer, not a fruit cocktail.
Overall - special. One of the few deeply flavored beers that I enjoy. There are some notes I don't like, but altogether this beer just works. 708 charactersJeffsta1, Jul 14, 2016

4.43/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375 ml bottle into a tulip glass.  Bottled 3/13/15, had on 5/28/16.
Pours a mostly opaque, deep ruby, with a two finger, quickly dissipating head and some lacing.  Fair amount of streaming bubbles.  Smell is malt, currants, grapes, some cherries, red wine- more as it warms, tobacco, Belgian yeast, some oak, some black pepper when fully warmed.  The taste also begins with the malt, then tart currants, some cherries and vanilla, raisins, some red wine and oak, tobacco- less than the nose.  some sourness as it warms.  Good level of tartness throughout.  So flavorful.  Smooth, dry, great body, refreshing.  
First off, a huge shout out to Rambo, at Rambo's Longhorn Liquors in Estes Park, CO, for this one.  Didn't have to bring it out for a tourist passing through.  
A very unique flavor, well blended.  The currants are prevalent, if not dominant, which can't be easy to do.  Worth all the accolades it receives. 921 charactersstortore, Jul 12, 2016

4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pour is a dark brown, close to amber hue with off-white colored head that quickly settles to a ring. Loud fizz, not much lacing going on. 
Aroma definitely is cranberry and red wine foward with hints of hay and belgian-like yeast. Oak and wood is very dominate in the background, and even more dominate as it warms.
First thing I noticed with the taste is this pop of cherry, mixed with sour apple. Hints of red wine and sweet tart. Oak is definitely noticeable in the back end, giving it this nice earthy yeast profile.
Mouthfeel is fizzy and carbonated like most sours. Thin bodied, and 10% abv definitely not detectable. Overall more tart than sour. Wouldn't consider this beer as complex as supplication(only other RR sour I've tried), but possibly more balanced. Easy drinker, highly suggested. 802 charactersMateo2699, Jun 22, 2016

AR: Dark fruit, plum, currant, red wine, oak.
T: Follows nose, sweet fruit on the palate, oak and red wine on the finish, ABV completely hidden.
M: Medium light body, medium carbonation, dry w/ a slightly sticky finish.
My favorite RR sour from the bottle. Some of the other 12.7oz bottled sours are overly oaky and tannic. This one is beautifully balanced. 425 charactersyung_peli, Jun 22, 2016

4.41/5  rDev 0%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A very dark brown with some dark red edge to it.  Small head, off white, almost tan like, 1/4".  Aroma hits those currant, cranberry, red wine, cabernet grape, dark cherry and oak forest notes.
Taste, wow, this is a big sour, almost bitter, astringent tannin like effort.  Probably the most challenging of all their wild ales, even though the alcohol is still amazingly well hidden.  Its a pricey beer that keeps going up, but as far as the darker more Belgian inspired wild ales over here, it is still one of the best. 520 charactersrodbeermunch, Apr 14, 2016

Taste: Rich malt sweetness, loads of dark fruit character, some light toasted oak, and a Cabernet note shows up on the swallow. Lactic sourness strong throughout, but builds to sharp bite at the finish. Mouthfeel: Medium body with a high carbonation. Very little evidence of the 10% ABV.

4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.75Poured gently at 48°F from a 375ml bottle (bottled on 13Mar15) into a tulip. Consumed on 18Feb16.
LOOK: Pours with a half fingers worth of white foam that shrivels into a partial line within 25 seconds. Dark red in color with a moderate amount of cloudiness. Rising bubbles are small in size and moderate in quantity. Lacing is thin and almost non-existent.
SMELL: Very strong aromas of sour green apple entangle with strong aromas of tobacco and spicy red wine, mild hay, oak, and earthy yeast aromas, and subtle tart/sweet currant aromas. 
TASTE: Very strong sour green apple and strong spicy red wine flavors first bombard the palate. This is definitely not a beer for those who are beginning their trek into sours. Strong tobacco and mild hay flavors immediately follow the initial taste. Mild oak, earthy yeast, and tart/sweet currant flavors are the last to make their debut as all previous flavors persist.
FEEL: Full-bodied and highly carbonated. Goes down rough due to the carbonation levels. Finishes with a strong dryness. A mild alcoholic warmth can be felt as it goes down the throat.
NOTE: As beer warms, the red wine flavors becomes stronger. I'm not big on red wines, but this was brilliant. Even though the wine shined through, it played very well with the other flavors. 1,289 charactersMyotus, Feb 19, 2016

4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5L: Pours a shimmering burgundy with an off white head that barely ever exists and struggles to keep its head above the surface. From above the glass Consecration is plum or even cola in nature. From below it appears to flit between gold and copper. Eye level with Consecration leaves a multihued elixir that starts with a beautiful glassy brown that turns to red with a sliver of fiery orange gleaming at the bottom of the bowl. This might be the most beautiful beer I've ever seen.
S: Ripe cherries and overly ripe currants of the mushy sticky variety. Red wine and mellow wood. A bit of yeast.
T: Sweet and sour cherry mash dribbling with a smidgen of funk and a whole lot of sour punch. The wine and currants really round the sourness into a fruity dryness. Holy heavens above I could drink this every day.
F: Nice carbonation, gives Consecration a lively almost cream mouth feel to start. The longer it sits in your glass the more subdued and slick it becomes.
O: This is a near perfect creation by Russian River. If I could only drink one sour or wine for the rest of my life, this would be it. 1,103 charactersVictorsValiant, Feb 09, 2016

L:  Pours a deep mahogany color.  Thin off-white head with nice lacing.
S:  Oak and tartness... citrus... vanilla. Red wine.
T/F:  Tart up front, but not a true lip pucker.... more of a sour cherry sensation.   Complex and oaky... hints of vanilla and red wine.  Gives way to an almost caramel sweetness at the finish and in the aftertaste.  Not sure what this beer is but I don't dislike it.  In fact... I just may love it.  Carbonated and intriguing.
O:  What an interesting beer, and I like that in addition to making it sour and exploring the yeast/bacteria mix they also threw in some great flavors and the sweet finish really took me back.  It's from Russian River so you know it's going to be well made.   Definitely one to be sipped and experienced. 828 charactersEMV, Jan 08, 2016

Tan head is nice at the pour, but subsides quickly. Aromas of Cherry, currant, caramelized sugar, raspberry, oak, cabernet, ... flavor is the same but adds just enough malty sweetness, balsamic, leather, tobacco,  citrus, earth, vanilla and maybe a touch of cocoa.. not extremely sour, but very complex and drinks like 7% rather than 10% ABV.  Mouthfeel is on the med-light side with high carbonation, but coats your tongue with lacto and pedio goodness. Overall I could drink this every day with a steak and be a happy camper.

I've been excited about this beer for a couple of months; I bought one one a trip to SF in early September and wanted to let it age a little longer.
The color is nice, a dark amber with a decent sized head. There are definitely cabernet notes to the aroma. The taste is heavily influenced by the cabernet barrels. I get hints of the wine, and there is definitely a note of the wood in there. 
I love the idea of a dark sour, and this is stellar in flavor. It is incredibly tangy with just a hint of sweetness. The refermenting in the bottle has made Consecration very effervescent; it's so bubbly it stings my mouth a bit!
Overall, a top notch sour. 691 charactersjosephandbrown, Nov 07, 2015

I have been aging this beer in my cellar for 8 months and finally opened this weekend. Pours a deep brown with deep red hues. Smell was very pungent which over powered the taste of the beer....which had some complex layers of currant, oak and napa cab. I have had many sours from russian river and I think this was my least favorite of them all. 404 charactersBiggiekrock627, Oct 27, 2015

Definitely get oak and red wine character on the aroma with currants and some citrus. Oak jumps out on the taste which I like and I'm surprised how prominent the dark fruits are considering this is a year old. Lots of wine flavor with dry finish with lots of oak tannins. The citrus adds brightness and complexity. The alcohol is present in a nice way adding heft and a little edge without ever taking center stage. Mouth feel is medium to full and very drinkable. 501 charactersdanh53, Oct 13, 2015

Maybe it's my imagination, but it's not quite as acidic as Supplication is and therefore I found it to be easier to drink. Still, both are excellent sours. 233 charactersMehinaman, Oct 12, 2015

Delicious rich aromas of oak, wine, raspberries, and vanilla.  Lots of oak up front, almost astringent, flavors of berries and cherry with a very tart finish.  Fairly viscous and medium bodied.  Excellent stuff, only complaint is I wish the astrigency from the oak would be toned down. 375 charactersBowWowWowYippyYoIPA, Sep 26, 2015

The cabernet and currents comes through strong on the nose and the flavor. Sweet, its a sipper. This is an awesome offering, but I think the cab/currants came through a little strong. This kind of reminds me of a sweet port - great for an after dinner sip, but nothing I would want with food. 406 charactersAnalogErik, Sep 08, 2015

S — Rich aroma that is distinctly red wine. To be honest, I don't know my wine like I know my beer, but it is definitely what it claims to be.
T — Not too sour, but strong flavors of red wine and dark fruits. Comes together into a very balanced, though complex, flavor. Having said that, it isn't quite my thing. More of a personal palate than anything imperfect or wrong with the beer. My cabernet loving girlfriend absolutely adores this beer.
M — Well carbonated, medium body. Very drinkable.
O — For a lover of red wines and sour beers, I would imagine that this  is absolutely incredible. As for myself, I am merely the latter, and as such I do enjoy this, but not as much as some might. 802 charactersKevinL, Sep 06, 2015

Impressive rush of carbonation and head that fizzes and seems as if it will quickly recede, does, but then remains as a quarter finger of thick, light khaki-colored foam. Dark brown color with light amber hues. Fizzy carbonation visible. 4.75
From afar, I perceived some vinegary notes and they're there for sure on the nose, but accompanied by an oaky red wine aroma. Caramelized sugar factors in too. 4
Some vinegary qualities on the flavor too, but light and contained. Light hints of brown sugar and red wine are in the mix. 4
Tart and to some degree sour. Light vinegar and acidity. Drinks with a wine-like quality with a silky body and a dry finish. 4.25 732 charactersONovoMexicano, Aug 08, 2015

4.41/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25There is a lot to say about this beer.  Nice brett and lactic twang on the nose, bout not a lot in the way of fruit.  Taste is similar.  Certainly vinous. In comparison to Belgian beers, it is a bit like Rodenbach Grand Cru with some added brett (that's a compliment). Overall, a great beer with plenty of added complexity from the oak.  My only complaint is that for a fruit sour, I'd like to see the currants shine through more. 430 characterscaptaincoffee, Jul 30, 2015

I AM, however, a big wine lover (cabs especially) and the cab barrel influence in this beer really strikes me, as do the currants.  The ABV is hidden very well.  This is one of the better dark sour ales I've ever had.  Seek and enjoy! 307 charactersbowzer4birdie, Jul 29, 2015

I joked that it tasted more like red wine than beer after each sip, but it really does combine the best of both very effectively. It's sweet and it's sour and it's easy to smell all the complex goings-on from the currants fermenting in the oak barrels. I'd drink this again and again. 321 charactersbmeehan, Jul 27, 2015
4.91/5  rDev +11.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Looks a little thinner than expected - light loose head forms and fades immediately.
Copper/Amber color, absolutely clear.
Nose is bright with deep aroma of currant and black cherry.
Sour is huge, lots of pucker and an extra bitter aspect comes through big.  A lot of depth and character.  Brilliant bright fruit mixed with dark ripe fruit.  Sour, abrasive in some aspects and delicate in others.  
This is a fantastic beer. 428 charactersoldn00b, Jul 27, 2015

S — Bright and complex. Wonderful notes of cabernet and black currant sweetness. Great dry oak character as well.
T — Great depth of complexities, wonderful tart and astringent notes of currants, dark fruits. Great barrel character and nice notes of cabernet. Super sour, dry, and lightly bitter.

4.13/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Draft, poured into a wine glass.
Appearance: ruby brown and clear, with a light tan head that fades quickly to a thin veil. Very small bubbles; spritzy. I know you can't judge a book by its cover, but this is a beer, and from this beer's appearance, I knew it would be good.
Aroma: stone fruit and sour. 
Taste: nice and sour. Tart, but not mouth puckering so. Tartness is upfront, which fades to a dry finish at which point the Brett funk arrives. The Brett funk is subdued. I can't detect any of the currants. The beer is wonderfully smooth for being 10% ABV. No alcoholic warmth.
Mouthfeel: light-medium.
Overall: this is probably the highest rated beer I've tried. Honestly, I think this beer is overhyped. It is good - very good - but not deserving a BA score of 4.5/5.0. Of the sours I've tried recently, I prefer (in order) Crooked Stave Sentience, Trinity Red Swingline and Boulevard Love Child #3 (cellared 1 year). 929 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Jul 14, 2015

Reminds me of La Folie, but I think this trumps it based on how smooth it finishes. 336 charactersblindtiger24, Jul 11, 2015

4.49/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My extremely good and awesome buddy Jon Passow, who as of a few months ago became the Manager of Barrel Room Operations at Anderson Valley Brewing Company, sent me this in a package from northern, CA a few months ago along with some other awesome beers from Russian River.  This is the last beer from that package and I was saving it until tonight.  Poured out of a 12.68 oz bottle into one of my tulip glasses.  POP! goes the cork as I pulled it out of this bottle.  This beer pours a clear, dark amber color with somewhat bright ruby and copper highlights when help up tot he light.  This beer appears to be quite carbonated indeed, as even about 5 minutes or so to after being poured there is still a nicely audible hiss of the fizz created from the many streams of bubbles a rapidly rising to the beer's surface.  The head/carbonation/foam reminds me a lot of soda pop being poured into a glass, only the hiss of the fizz lasts much, much longer here than it ever has with any soda pop I ever poured into a glass.  Had a slightly off white/tan head about 1/3 of an inch thick.  Aromas of roasted currant and a slight caramel malt presence along with a nice hint of oak and cherry and cranberry tart.  The taste is pretty much the same, with a slight toasted caramel sweetness that gives way to currants and a nice cranberry and cherry tart sweetness along with a nice musty funk that gives way to subtle vinegar and an even subtler hint of salt.  In some ways I'd say the flavor profile is laid back in a sense here, and it works very well.  It certainly has a fair amount of sourness to if, but it is not in your face overwhelming your taste buds and making a huge fuss about it. Has a clean and dry finish and the sour tartness likes to hang out on the back of the tongue in the aftertaste.  This is one beer that I wish my glass was never ending of.  To quote my  good friend Passow "This is a beer that is so good that you can drink it in bed and it will lull you to sleep."  Has a crisp, slightly prickly, yet smooth and frothy, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate to heavy carbonation.  Simply an excellent beer all around!  Much thanks to my friend for sending this one to me!

Smell: Roasty Currant up front. Little yeast funk. Little oakyness.
Taste: Tart. Dark Fruits. Hard caramel. Little bit of leather. Musty. There is so much going on in this beer. Wow. The alcohol is a little hot on the finish but overall a great job of masking/incorporating it into the flavor profile.
Feel: Finish is medium-dry to Dry. Pretty silky soft Cab tannin. Lovely.
Overall: Delightful, delicious, adventurous and unique. A special brew that will often occupy my beer fridge. 646 charactersDikfour, Jun 11, 2015

4.48/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Reddish brown, dark but great clarity, plenty of fine carbonation, fizzly champagne-like tan-red head that makes a quick exit and leaves only a collar.
S: Cherry and cranberry, tart. Some red wine notes come through, although it smells lighter than cabernet sauvignon to me (but my wine palate sucks).
T: Bright cherry, red grape, mild puckering sourness, some tartness/funk. Very light woody note, like cork. Flavors last a decent while, but not long enough. Pretty dry.
M: No gritty saccharine or syrup, just crisp prickly carbonation. Too easy to drink.
O: Incredible fruit flavor, good funk, and decent puckering ability. The lack of that outright sourness is my only personal gripe, if you can even call it that. Otherwise just about a perfect representative of the style, and still damn good (possibly unequaled) in my book. 837 characters1000lbgrizzly, Jun 08, 2015

This one pours a clear dark red, with a small head, and no lacing.
This one smells super tasty, cherries, currants, red wine vinegar, oak, and red wine.
This has clearly aged very nicely, it's nuts that it's 10% ABV, you wouldn't know. So much sour dark fruit here, lots of currants, and a nice sour cherry flavor as well. There's some dry mustiness, along with a pretty puckering sourness, about a 7/10 on the unofficial sour scale. So. Good.
This is light bodied, with a crisp, super tart, and very juicy mouthfeel, along with a moderate but lively level of carbonation.
Probably the best sour I've had from Russian River, it was just so enjoyable. 741 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jun 07, 2015

Consumed: 5.24.15
A: 4.5 Pours a clear, reddish-brown. The one-inch, light tan head lasts about a minute leaving good lacing.
S: 4.5 Love the aromas coming off this beer. A bit of funk comes in first, but after the beer has a chance to open up for a couple minutes, currents, cherries (with a slightly medicinal aroma), oak, vinegar, and even a bit of chocolate come through. 
T: 4.5 Like the nose, there is a really pleasant fruitiness playing off the dark malts and oaky tannins. The flavor is somewhat tart, but what’s really impressive is how the acidity and sweetness go back and forth. 
M: 4.75 Perfect carbonation and very clean feeling. The body is rich enough to feel substantial, while the slightly dry finish leaves you wanting another sip. 
O: 4.5 Consecration is consistently one of my favorite sours and never disappoints. With all the great flavors and aromas going on, you could really sit and contemplate this beer for a long time; but it’s also so easy drinking, you could just sit back, take it all in, and enjoy. As much as I enjoy the bottles, I think I prefer this beer slightly when on draught. 1,158 charactersTele, May 25, 2015

A&S: Murky red, semi lively beer. Off white fizzy head dies right away. Potent aroma including elements of red (and also surprisingly wine) wine, earthy tones, and mild tartness
T&M: Much more tart than I expected, not quite at a puckering level. Some touches of sour tones. Initially it has a winey aftertaste, and then it transforms into more of a malty tone, pretty interesting. On the higher side of medium carbonation and medium body.
Overall: Really solid and very unique. These very winey tones mix in with a tart sourness is pretty unique, other beers are doing this, but not quite in the same way. Pretty short non-descriptive rating of this beer, but honesty it was pretty darn good. 763 charactersminterro, Apr 17, 2015

Pours a dark ruby red
Smells amazing, dark fruits, subtle red wine, currants
Punches you in the mouth with the puckerness. I can taste the red wine and fruit
Finishes in a way that leaves you salivating for more.

3.7/5  rDev -16.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75One of the top rated sours in the country and I finally got one from my buddy Randy!
A - Rich burgundy color when poured but is a red-tinged brown color in the glass. Slightly cloudy from the yeast with a nice white head but subsides to nothing after a minute or two.
S - The smell is fruity and very complex. It is vinous with the currants and typical cab grape fruit notes. There is some alcohol, some fruit esters, and some soft Belgian character present. There is some sour and some oakiness but the dark fruit character is true.
T - The first sip just explodes with red wine vinegar! The sour makes you pucker from the front to the back of the palate. After the initial sour punch the complexities come out. There is a fruit character more like Cabernet and not as much like the currants. There is the sweetness of the malt, oak, and some Belgian character but it is very subtle in comparison to the strong sour character.
M - Medium to light mouth-feel with light carbonation. Like a sour soda that has fizz initially but dies down and for 10% ABV it is much more like a wine than a Belgian strong ale.
Overall, a very interesting beer. I was not expecting the full on sour, red wine vinegar, shock to my palate when I first cracked this open. It is a unique experience with a distinct sour and then sweet/complex nature. It is also very thin for what the base beer is and very much like a sour wine. I would not recommend this unless you like sours and have a heart for a bolder sour experience. I could see someone liking it but at an "rAvg: 4.5" I was expecting more flavor and less sour.

Aroma is really fruit forward with the currants making me think of blackcurrant wine. Also some caramel and wood notes. Taste is sweet with fruits and caramel notes at first but gets intensely sour and acidic on the finish and aftertaste. You can get a bit of warming alcohol too. Really nice fruit profile and complex taste. 376 charactersCiocanelu, Mar 10, 2015

Aroma is sour cherries (the currants?), vinegar, barrel notes of oak and grape, plus tobacco and the yeast/bacteria funk. Flavors start with puckering tart cherry, ease into light fruit sweetness, and end with those drying red wine elements. Medium-full bodied, silky texture, active carbonation, and a dry finish. Complex and interesting overall. 452 charactersSierraFlight, Mar 01, 2015

3.57/5  rDev -19%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.5375 ml bottle. Bottled on 08/11/14. Enjoyed 02/22/15. I had heard nothing besides greatness about the Russian River Brewing Company, and with an interest in sours, I knew I had to try Consecration. Ended up scouting this guy out and shelling over $16 for a 375 ml bottle! Damn! The most expensive beer I have ever purchased to date (by far!).
A: Murky/turbid due to being fermented in the bottle. Amber to slightly purple color. Very nicely carbonated. Poured pretty foamy, but the head died off rather quickly.
S: First impression was a very strong alcohol smell followed by wine/currants. Light Cabernet aroma. Surprisingly to me, this beer doesn't pack whole lot of aroma.
T: Currants, oak, and wine were the first flavors I distinguished. You can definitely tell that this is aged in Cabernet barrels. Not very sour compared to other sour beers I have had before. Not overpowering at all. Sweet, but not too much so. Dry funky flavors pull their way though--I'm thinking it's the Brettanomyces. Dry finish. Champagne-like effervescence. Tamarind notes found in the aftertaste.
M: Leaves the tongue with a tannic feel. Must be from the barrel.
O: Overall, this beer is very dry, very oaky, very wine-like, lightly acidic, with a strong alcohol taste. I hate to sound sacrilegious, but this beer really didn't do it for me. It just wasn't what I was looking for. If I really wanted all of those wine flavors, I might as well have gone with wine. I have found a few Belgian sours to be more pleasurable and interesting to me, but it is obvious that many people get very excited about this beer, so I couldn't not recommend it. At this price point though, I think I'll be holding off for a while before reevaluating this interesting creation. 1,747 charactersdemon, Feb 23, 2015

The taste is very crisp, fruity, peach, grapefruit, currants, champagne like, wine, dried fruits and dry sour on the back end. 359 charactersSandalwood, Feb 22, 2015

Flavor is tart and sour, with a dry finish. The currants add citric acid complexity to the lactic already present. Belgian character is definitely  dominated by the wild yeast. 252 charactersbarczar, Feb 16, 2015

A: Amber color with some light coming through around the edges, lots of carbonation streaming off the bottom, looks pretty thin, no head.
A: Big sour tart aromas up front, getting some of the spice and Cabernet coming through, smells great.
T: Big sour upfront, some spice, tart, funk, definitely picking up the Cabernet, oak, very dry finish, alcohol is well hidden for 10%. 
M: Mouthfeel is very dry, watery, not much on the feel. 
O: Very good beer, the quality just comes through on this, not as sour as I thought it would be, very dry, alcohol is well hidden, I don't have too much experience with sours but I am hoping to sample more to get a better grasp on them. 729 charactersBrolo75, Feb 09, 2015

4.14/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I'm not the ideal drinker for this brew, as Belgian darks aren't a style really up my alley to begin with, nor, for that matter, are black currants. Taken together, along with the healthy dose of souring bacteria and wine barrel treatment, this one is a bit much for me, although it's obviously a well put together brew. The Belgian yeast/phenols still find their way through the mix a bit much for my liking, as well as all that dark fruitiness that the style + the currants add. That said, I can't ding this too much, because, again, it's clearly well done. I actually probably need to procure another one of these soon for a revisit. In any case, if you're willing to pony up the $, I'd say it's worth a runout. 714 charactersbreadwinner, Dec 31, 2014

Pours a fiery dark red color, with a fizzy, small head.
Smells of an intriguing tart funkiness, part barnyard, part sour, fermented fruit. Both smells blend very well together, supported by a pleasant, wooden malt note. The currants got a sweet, pungent hint to them, which enhances their sour aspect. The fruitiness turns even more present, while the brew warms up.
Begins with musty, wooden malts, joined by prickly currants, on which a dry, funky sourness settles, accompanying the fruity acidity. The barrel character provides wooden oak qualities, setting the balance of the beer. Then the sourness gets even dryer and more acidic, drying-out the tongue. Drinks dangerously easy, the alcohol is extremely well hidden. Finishes with matured, slightly wooden, leathery malts, with the addition of ripe grapes, while the tartness covers the outside of my teeth, leaving back a melange of joung currants and slick acidity. 965 charactersaleigator, Dec 27, 2014

I am not generally a big fan of the sour beers but this was fantastic.  The high alcohol was well-hidden under the many layers of flavor.  One of the best beers I have ever had.

Pours a crystal-clear cola-like reddish-brown with a thin fizzy head that fell fast leaving no lacing or collar.  The nose is really nice, ripe fruit (cherries and raspberries), raisins and a nice tart acidity.  The taste is fruit forward with ripe cherries and raisins at the finish with hints of oak, tobacco, plum and vinous notes.  The body is medium light and very smooth and in no way reflects the 10% ABV, most likely aided by the lively carbonation.  This is flat out, just a delicious, well crafted beer! 542 charactersmtomlins, Dec 09, 2014

Real nice balanced wild ale. A tad sour with real strong wine notes... Cherry, Grape, Oak, Green Apple, Cigar, Berries, Soda, Vinegar (think wine) a touch of Vanilla and Raisins. Nothing like I have ever had. I will say I thought 'Temptation' was a bit more satisfying for me. The more I sip, the more my palette really begins to crave it. Amazing carbonation. Overall, I would love to have this or any Russian River readily available~ 599 charactersClePaul, Nov 08, 2014

Smells of sour cherries, vinegar, some oak, and some more overly ripe fruits. Wow. The taste opens up the palate with a smack of tartness that follows with sour apples, cherries and wine. Dryness throughout helps to balance out the sourness. Super dry finish. Wow. RR really killed it here. Probably my favorite sour to date. World-class stuff. 408 characterswinningwes91, Oct 16, 2014

4.58/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark rich, deep red, almost brown.  Small tan head that dissipates quickly.
Smell is of dark cherry, currants, some funk, metals, blackberry, earth.
Taste begins with an almost sweet cherry flavor that quickly sours.  Nice fruitiness to this beer as well as some slight terroir as wine people would say.  Mid-palate returns to a big dark cherry/ black currant flavor that lingers on to finish nice and clean with a sour spike right at the end that puckers the lips and dries the tongue.
Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Fairly dry.
Overall a very good beer. Not my first sour, but the first sour I can say I have truly enjoyed. 636 charactersBigRedDog, Sep 22, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7.7%A dark ruby colored beer with a nice dense ivory colored head on top. Rich and fruity up front on the nose. The currants come through nicely here. First sips gives a great introduction to this beers wild side. Not immensely sour, but a nice tartness with a bit of a vinegary note and sour cherry. Nicely carbonated and a fairly smooth and creamy mouthfeel. 356 charactersKinsman, Aug 27, 2014

Bottled 2014-02-11. Poured on 2014-08-13. Delicious as could be. Not sure what this is like super fresh or with another 5-6 months to put it at a year old, but right now it's uber-tasty. Wish I could come across more in an easier fashion and I cannot wait to try again and try it's brother/sisters (Supp, temp, Beat, etc.). 385 charactersB-Nut-GoBlue, Aug 14, 2014

4.9/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle date 07.18.13. Pours a ruby brown with a thin, quickly dissipating off white head. No lacing. Lots of dark stone fruit and vinegar on the nose with gobs of oak, vanilla and red wine, what an aroma! Incredibly complex. Sour on the tongue with lots of oak, vanilla, red wine and black cherry. Ends slightly bitter but doesn't last long. The complexity helps tame the 10% ABV. Medium bodied with silky mouthfeel. Carbonation is intense initially but overall rather light. Finishes dry. Overall, a beautifully crafted American Wild Ale that takes its place in the pantheon of great sours! 591 charactersJohnG190, Aug 12, 2014

Poured at Blind Lady Ale House, San Diego
This was my conversion sour years ago and I've lost my review, so I figured I'd quickly reassess my opinion of one of the most coveted beers out there. After going through a couple sips, I think I may have actually underrated the beer. Thinking about all the other sour beers out there, this one is just different...slightly sweeter, oakier, more complex. 
A: Cola-like in color with a red hue, the small head leaves sticky lacing all over the glass. 
S: A huge bouquet yields notes of of grapes and cherries, oak and raspberries. White pepper and a touch of booze are also notes. Yeasty funk lingers around the edges of the bouquet. 
T: The brew has a lot if vino descriptors, which I suspect was the intention. Berries and citrusy acid at the front of palate. Jammy, tart, a little boozy, with drying oak and vinous aspects. Plenty of malty sweetness in this one, carrying through a long and a long and balanced finish. 
M: Light and refreshing on the palate, with a little more viscosity than your average wild ale. 1,090 charactersrand, Jul 26, 2014

S: Aromas are revealing a vinous, cabernet, wine ratio which is nicely supplemented by funky notes of figs, oak, cherry, plums, brown sugar, lemon, dark fruits and of course accompanied by sourness. The notes/intricacies on this guy are fantastic
T: Sour, tart, and funk are quite prevailing and pleasing. In keeping with the smell, the taste is that of a vinous, wine feel. Notes are that of grapes, raisins, lemon, cherry, slight vinegar, and a woody oak earthiness feel; very similar to the smell
M: Medium to Full body, medium carbonation, lots of sour funk, the presence of wine, and just an overall complex beer
O: Complex and incredible; being extremely well balanced and very smooth make this out to be a superbly refreshing beverage 899 charactersM-Fox24, Jul 21, 2014

Appearance: Dark amber color, beautiful carbonation streams, and yeast floating around. A firm and smooth one finger head until the bottom of glass. Lovely foam streamers left around the glass.
Aroma: More malty than I expected. At first reminded me of a caramel heavy barley wine. Strong sour scent next with strong lemon tones. Dark fruit smell from raisins and prunes. 
Taste: Lemon warhead candy, red wine, vanilla from oaky wood. Touch of caramel malt in the back ground. This is probably the best sour I have ever had. 
Mouthfeel: Strong sour cringe, with smooth flow. Carbonation is mild and smooth, and a bit astringent in the back. 10% ABV is noticed in the swallow with minor burn
Overall: FANTASTIC! Highly recommend to anyone who can get their hands on it. 811 charactersBeerSnobsUnited, Jul 18, 2014

Full Belgian Tulip 
A: Deep Merlot color body with some dark brown and purplish tones throughout. Fairly opaque and hazed look to it with a thin layer of khaki cream that quickly settles out to a crown. Light swaths and dots of lace are left behind.
S: Grapey and vinous with a suggestion of red wine vinegar underneath. Slightly sweet with some earthy musk coming through. Something mineral there and iron like. Seriously smells like a grape sour candy though. It is quite the delight. 
T: The flavors are boldly vinous with Bordeaux grape and some green oaky notes that meld into a refreshingly tart pucker. I get some toned down vinegar qualities and a bit of those earthy mineral deposits in the back. There is a moderate level of bitterness here that works well with the woodsy tannins to dry the beer out in the finish and at 10% ABV this is incredibly well balanced with the alcohol completely disguised. A feat in itself really. Overall just super delicious.
M: Moderately full in body with a nice tartness that puckers the palate. There is a touch of tannic astringency to help dry the finish. Slightly watery overall. 
D: An Incredible American Wild. Very bold in flavors with a great red wine influence. Yet incredibly well balanced and easy to drink. Nice and tart without much funkiness to it. I actually prefer Consecration over the Supplication. 1,401 charactersNugganooch, Jul 17, 2014

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a small fairly dense off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing fairly quickly. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour cherry, green apple, raisin, plum, fig, red wine, oak, clove, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big sour cherry, green apple, raisin, plum, fig, red wine, oak, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, green apple, raisin, plum, fig, red wine, oak, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and fruit flavors; with a great sweetness/sourness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, acidic, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited wild ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering. 1,513 characterssuperspak, Jul 13, 2014

A: Pours a murky brown with well over a finger of airy white head that disappears quickly and leaves only a thin collar. The viscosity does not look like any 10% beer I've ever had before! this looks much thinner and watered down. 
S: A strong aroma of funk hits up front, and really takes control throughout. I get more wine notes from this than I do currants - and this is probably for the better. 
T: Early in the glass the funk and sour is very dominant. Once my taste buds adjust, the dark fruits and wine shine through. 
M: High level of carb, leaves a bitter dry finish. 
O: This is such a well crafted beer, I enjoyed every aspect of it from first to last sip. When the sour starts to give way to flavor, it's amazing how everything comes together so well. 810 charactersroger617, Jul 13, 2014

Poured into a chalice.
A- Amber brown in color, some ruby highlights. Light tan head, doesn't retain much.
S- A little boozy in smell. Cherry coke and whiskey. Tangy fruit.
T- Tart cherry, a bit of oak, still this faint hint of cola. Lots of tang!
M- Lip-smacking tartness. Rather light in body, so this will hit hard and fast. Semi-dry finish.
O- Really great. So tangy, lots of great flavors. 475 charactersBWED, Jul 02, 2014

S: Big Cabernet and wine barrel aromas coupled with slightly acidic macerated dark berries explode from the glass. Notes of vanilla, oak, and sweet malt in the background. Absolutely beautiful nose, smells like an more acidic glass of red wine.
T: Big tart hit fist, but not bracingly so. Tannic cab grapes and blackberries. Sweet malt and a dark fruit character (currants?) round out the flavor. Extremely balanced for an AWA and again lots of emphasis on the wine character.
M: Medium bodied and bone dry, with a very tannic finish. Spritzy carbonation.
O: Just slightly behind supplication for me, but still absolutely world class. I love red wine, so am a little biased, but what Vinnie does with his wine barrels in just unreal. 876 charactersMore_betterness, Jun 28, 2014

A: Dark brown, almost crimson. 2 finger head when poured. Thin bit of it remains during the 30 min I spend drinking it. Nice stuff.
S: Tart cherries, dark grapes. Some notes of Cab and oak. I've probably put my stupid nose in this thing 50 times already. Wow.
T: Puckering sour on the front of the tongue, but in no way overbearing. Light malt backbone and those Cab flavors come through. A fantastic, complex sour.
M: Perfect amount of carbonation. Almost impossible to tell this is 10% ABV.
O: Probably the best sour I've had to date. Incredible. 582 charactershoppytobehere, Jun 28, 2014

Pours a murky brown with mahogany highlights. Head to one finger and settles to a nice full ring around the edge of the glass with froth islands in between. Sharp tan colored head.
The aroma like Supplication is very wine barrel forward. Awesome Cabernet marries blackberry, raisin, black cherry, tart plum, and whiffs of cola. Oak and vanilla join the party making the nose on this about as enticing as they can get. 
Flavor is on the same track as the aroma. Everything is there with the Cabernet still having a major influence. The dark fruits are leathery and sweet. Oak muscles through from the mid palate to the finish and the vanilla teases at being creamy but that whole circus is shut down quick when a dry, tannic grip takes hold on the finish. The 10 percent abv is hidden very well. Still tastes worldclass.
Body is a solid light medium. Carbonation is still velvety and prickly given the higher abv encountered compared to its siblings. Dry, mouth puckering finish and overall mouthfeel. Never too sour. 
This still hangs with the best of them. My preference has always been Supplication and I've had many more Supplications than Consecrations in my life. But this right now is tasting as good as the Supplication I had the other night. They are really toe to toe and I may even be enjoying this a bit more but possibly because I hadn't had it for a good while. A classic, a legend, still wowing to this day. 1,531 charactersMarcWP, Jun 10, 2014

A: Poured half the bottle into a teku glass, the darker off white head built a finger tall and quickly fizzed out to a small ring on the edge of the glass. The beer is a dark crimson red to an almost purple color (like the label). Moderatly clear on the first half of the bottle with a constant flow of bubbles from the bottom.
S: Sharp acidic vinegar (for lack of a better description) aroma, similar to a red wine. Sweet blackberry and dark cherry notes mixed with subtle bready character. As it opens up, the sharpness of the sour character mellows out and it becomes very pleasant. Almost like a cherry/berry pie.
T: Big tartness, not super acidic or harsh; but crisp. The fruit flavors blend with the tartness naturally and bring out flavors of raspberries, blackberries, currents, and pomegranate. The bready, toasty malt character gives it the same pie character as in the aroma. No hop flavor or bitterness, and the oak flavor is just a side note to the complex flavors from the wild yeast in this beer.
M: A very dry finish with a low tannic astringancy. Carbonation is medium with a puckering sensation from the tartness.
O: Fantastically sippable and enjoyable beer. My first Russian River Sour and definitely not my last. Complex, very tart and a nice berry flavor through out. 1,310 charactersguityler83, Jun 08, 2014

A: Pours deep brown with an off-white head that quickly fades. Brown leads to a gorgeous, deep ruby red when held to the light.
S: Deep, sour wine, tart currant, almost like Warhead candy, some funk, some sweetness, very nice.
T: Follows the nose, with intense red wine and tart red cherry flavors unveiling first, followed by some oak tannins, and a sour funk that lingers nicely on the finish. Superb!
M: Medium with high levels of dry carbonation. All in all, like an amped up, carbonated red wine.
O: Truly outstanding, and leaps above Damnation, which is the only other sour I've had from Russian River. The Cabernet barrels really shine through in the flavor, resulting in a one-of-a-kind taste profile. 757 charactersHalfbrother83, Jun 05, 2014

Pours a translucent reddish dark brown. The 1/4 inch off-white head quickly disappears completely and leaves very faint spots of lace. 
The smell is of barnyard funk, assorted dark fruits and faint alcohol. 
The taste is of tart currant, dark grapes and unripe cherries. 
The texture is medium bodied with high carbonation. 
An amazing sour brown ale with delicious tart dark fruit aromas and flavors with Cabernet Sauvignon accents. World class. 472 charactersFurlinator, Jun 01, 2014

4.17/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a chalice from a 1.5 year old bottle. Smelled very "champagney" and tasted the same. I was expecting it to be a bit more tart and sour but it wasn't. It was almost too balanced which unfortunately I do not like as much with wild ales. Still was outstanding though just not what I thought it was going to be. 319 charactersZilaniz, May 24, 2014

Where do you go from here? This beer is like a syrup, an essence. It has moved onto beer nirvana.
Pours a delicious dark reddish brown color. Smells pure of funky yeast. Taste very tart, maybe some blackcurrants, definitively some grapes from the barrels. Has high acidity. Has to be enjoyed little by little, if not it's too sour. Good work. 350 charactersJulioH, May 22, 2014

A - Rusty brown, small off white collar.
S - Currant, licorice, sour grapes, and a bit of barnyard funk.
T - Cab barrels definitely shine through. Red wine with a big acidity and a medley of dark fruit notes in the back. I get some currant, raisin, and fig.
M - Dissipating, highly carbed and very refreshing.
O - Another amazing sour from RR. Murders other currant based sours I've had thus far. 490 charactersZach136, May 11, 2014

Dropping the overall score to reflect how it matches up against other wild ales that I've had since the first time I had this. Great beer, very wine like, dark red fruits. It's still a great beer and what other similar styles should be based on in my opinion. 296 characterscultclassic89, Apr 29, 2014

A: Dark reddish brown with thin active head and good amount of bubbles from carbonation. 
S: Deep rich acidic aroma. Sharp with it hints of grapes.
T: Tangy and tart. Complex mix of wine, fruit, acid and wood. Whoa! The first few sips overwhelm your mouth until it adjusts. Hides the alcohol mostly, just a faint taste in the background. 
M: A bit thinner than I expected but might feel lighter due to the pretty high initial carbonation. I assumed more body but was very satisfied with it when paired with the taste.
Overall, top notch example of a barrel aged sour. A bit immature so I will store the 2nd bottle for another year or so to compare. 670 charactersCUBeerBuff, Apr 28, 2014

4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 375 mL bottle into a stemmed glass. This is batch 8 which I believe was bottled early/mid 2012 so has a couple years on it.
Appearance: Pours a medium-dark red/brown and leaves a hint of off-white head that fizzles away in an instant, to nothing.
Smell: Big cabernet, oak, grapes, currants, vinegar, some funk, leather. Really big red wine influence here, but softer.
Taste: Leather, cabernet, oak, currants, sour cherries, grapes, lemon, vinegar. Finishes fairly dry. Very complex, and a really nice experience.
Mouth-feel: Low to medium carbonation with a medium, very wine-like body. Finishes a tad dry but the alcohol is really well masked for 10%. Really smooth.
Overall: Really well done beer, and the age has done wonders. Many cabernet qualities, but much softer and a little funk. Really an excellent drinking experience. 849 charactersResuin, Mar 18, 2014

S: Incredible. Ive had this many times and I look forward to the aroma just as much as the flavor. Its sour, tart, tangy, winey, dark grapes, cherries and berries.
T: This is a full-on pucker face sour bomb. Its red wine, cherries, oak and vanilla deliciousness.
M: Full, carbonated, tingly, explosive. Like pop rocks candy.
O: My favorite sour as the interplay between the intense tang/funk/fruit/oak is just perfect. 522 charactersvitALEity, Mar 18, 2014

Appearance: Poured down the side produced about a finger of think head that quickly fizzed away to some film and a ring. Reddish dark brown body the color of, well, currants. Lots of carbonation action. 
Aroma: Wow! First thing is a huge, musky, barnyard funk. Tart and tangy lacto in the middle with some sweet stone fruit rounding it out. Almost reminds me of rotting, fermenting cherries. 
Taste: Pucker inducing sour lacto/juicy stone fruit/lemon juice up front. Red wine soaked oak and vanilla in the middle with the sweet fruit note placating your pallet at the end. Leaves a lingering note of what to me tastes like sweet tarts. 
Mouthfeel: Medium/full feel with lots of carbonation. No heat but very warming going down. 
Overall: A surprising and exciting ale, even though I had an idea of what to expect going into it. Ridiculously funky in the nose with a leveling sour tang in the taste that is wrapped up nicely in a package by the wine barrel and some encouraging fruityness at the finish. The true story behind the name of this ale is that Jesus did not turn water into wine but water into beer, hence the name. Recommend consumption during worship services. Recommend pairing with dark chocolate with strawberry filling. 1,371 charactersCowsandBeer, Mar 16, 2014

S - Can definitely sense the currants and Cab barrels. Little worried it wont have a strong ale taste though.
T - Yeah, in my honest opinion it's a little lacking in the beer/ale flavor. It tastes like a dry soda. It's not bad, very drinkable, but I would love to try a stout aged in Cab barrels. I'm not a huge sour advocate, but if that is your thing, try this! You will like.
M - Very carbonated. Adds to the soda feel. No head. Reminds me of a Lindemans.
O - Obviously a very high quality offering but not for everyone. If you are into Lindemans or sours this is a must try. 615 characterssamtrillo, Mar 10, 2014

10% ABV 
APPEARANCE: Gorgeous colors in this beer. Deep ruby mahogany, with a burnt orange rim variation. Little to no head with very light lacing. 
AROMA: Nice and sour fruit right away. The Cabernet barrel explodes with notes of oak, currants, black cherry jam some barnyard funk rounds it out. 
TASTE: Very tart lots of green apples which I didn't get on the nose. Fades rather quickly into the currant and cherries. Definitely getting that Cabernet flavors and nice oakiness. 
MOUTHFEEL: Oddly enough without having a head on the beer there is a lot of prickly carbonation. Medium bodied slight oily feel maybe due to the Cabernet barrels. 
OVERALL: Great, easily approachable sour. Wine drinkers will really appreciate the complex flavor profiles. Thoroughly enjoyed this, I think sharing the bottle was the way to go. The high ABV is hidden well and makes it almost to easy to drink.

This one pours dark reddish purple with a hint of brown and a one finger off white head that dissipates quickly in a fizzy furry.. Aroma is strong vinous cabernet notes, sour vinegar, black cherry and other fruits. Flavor is a beautiful medley of dark cherries and sour vinegar, some bold wine like notes, other fruits, and a bit of booze intermingled with oak on the back end. Super tart and sour with nearly spritzy high carbonation. Heavy bodied and a big beer that can probably sneak up on you. Good stuff. 569 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 05, 2014

S-clear brett and cranberry fruit smells 
T- much more tart than I expected. The fruit balances nicely but it does seem a little harsh. The bacteria comes through but it com9letely covers up the belgian yeast strain it starts with.

T- Cabernet, sour yeast, spicy, dark fruit and earthiness.

Down the middle pour brings forth a thick off-white foam that quickly fizzles down to nothing. Deep burnt orange body when held to the light that is filled with carbonation zinging all around. 
The aroma is full of the souring bacteria, gets a little funky, currant, and cherry. Comes off like an Oud Bruin.
Plenty of fruitiness comes off with currant, red grape, and tart apple. The oak from the Cabernet barrels comes out slightly. Nice little musty funk hangs out at the end. No hint of the 10%. 
Fairly smooth medium body. Medium tartness on the palate. Finishes dry. 
Nicely balanced for such a big sour beer. Really well done beer that has great Cab qualities imparted into it. 720 charactersMattSweatshirt, Feb 06, 2014

M: Medium-full bodied, light carbonation, but a bit astringent.
O: Pretty much what you'd expect given the style of the beer, the style of the wine barrels, the talent of the brewers and the addition of wild yeast. It's delicious. 548 charactersBierJager89, Jan 24, 2014

4.23/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 48/8/2012 - 12 oz bottle poured into tulip glass. Batch 8.
A: Slow pour to keep yeast sediment (not much was evident) in the bottle. A fizzy head forms, but quickly disappears and leaves no lacing. Beer is a pleasant cordovan color.
S: Cabernet and sour Brett. Just a hint of the currants.
T: Strong sour ale, but the Cabernet and Brett work really well together. Not picking up currants as I expected. High carbonation leads to dry finish. Amazingly, no alcohol heat despite 10.0% ABV
M: A bit champagne-like, thin and dry.
O: Nobody does sour ales like Russian River. Expected more fruit a la their Supplication sour cherry ale, but this is very good.
Aging another bottle for a year; we'll see what it's like then.
1/10/14 - Well, that time flew by...
A: Slow pour again due to possible yeast accumulation (none in evidence). Smaller head than before, also quickly disappears. Still plenty of tiny carbonation bubbles. Either same color or a tiny bit darker
S: Cabernet and sour Brett. Strongly recommend serving at cellar temp as opposed to refrigerator to let the currant notes, such as they are, come through.
T: Very strong sour at refrigerator temp, out of balance at that point. Almost overwhelming. Warming helps a little.
M: Seems a bit more full-bodied, still no alcohol burn, but does induce quick drying. 
O: Aging did not seem to improve this at all. 1,376 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jan 10, 2014

A - Pours a slightly hazy ruby garnet hue with a fizzy one finger head that fades nearly immediately. Hard swirls produce fleeting wisps. 
S - Currants, vinegar, wine barrels, light funk, faint alcohol. Quite pleasant. Not too sour though.
T - Taste is considerably more sour than the nose. Powered smarties, currants, cherries, light leather. Oak tanins, a faint chocolate. The fruits almost come across as syrupy. The flavour is there, but...I just don't like it. I like black currants too so I'm kind of confused as to why I'm not digging the taste.
M - Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Nice and crisp, alcohol hidden quite nicely. 
O - Overall, I'm not sure if its the syrup like flavour aspects of this or what but I'm just not digging it. I want to like it, hell, I want to love it. Unfortunately though, I do not. 910 charactersrudzud, Dec 10, 2013

A: Pours a beautiful dark ruby red. Tall and short lived fizzy tan head. Head fades out very quickly as mentioned, with nary a speck of lacing in sight. Decent retention at least, oddly enough.
S: Very fruity - berry-like mostly. Not very sour, just a little tart red wine and some leathery and oaky tannins. Currants are there but very subtle. 
T: Okay, definitely more sour in the flavor. Lots of tart berries up front (presumably the currants). Not super vinegary but a very distinct underripe sour fruit flavor. Mild and tart red wine adds to the affect in the middle and also adds some complexity. Not a whole lot of oak, just a little bit of dryness in the aftertaste.
M: Surprisingly medium bodied, light and dry for 10% ABV.
O: Big sour fruits in this one. No major acetone, vinegar or even the typical citric acid. Just mouth puckering sour fruits. Very interesting. Big, sharp, bold flavors throughout. Almost no sweetness, all tartness with a drying aftertaste. Pretty unusual for a 10% ABV beer of any style. I'm not a huge fan of wine barrel beers but this is still a quality brew. 1,119 charactersDope, Dec 06, 2013

Had at 4 moths (11/23/13), 375 ml corked bottle into tulip:
A – dark brown, with ruby highlights, brandy appearance with no lacing.
S – sour cherry, dark fruits, an aged but lively current note, some oak with an inviting balanced sourness throughout. Aggressive but balanced.
T – you pick up some of the jammy Cab Sauv character and then dryness toward the end, works perfectly together with the sourness and intense dark fruits. Coating smooth tart and sour character, with some of the wine oaky tannins. Doesn’t feel overly sour at all with a dry finish and a balanced clean body.
M – initial carbonation fades off fairly quickly but still drinks so well. Alcohol presence is remarkably absent. Sourness integrates perfectly well giving a full bodied feel and a slick film on the finish. Steller.
A interesting and perfectly balanced blend of winey dark fruits, oaky dryness and a strong bretty sourness that feels so well-made, still a bit of liveliness to it and it balance is great. Nothing artificial or cloying. Delicious throughout, such a killer wild ale and you pick up all the elements that go into it really nicely and the end result is delicious.

Temptation is my favorite in the line of sours but this one is amazing as well. A little bit of the old world funk, and some nice barrel flavor as well. They have also mastered the perfect sour taste. Not like Love Child where it taste artificial and just pure sour. I recommend this beer to anyone. 366 charactersvinny21bal, Nov 23, 2013

Smells strongly of wine, funk, sweet yeast, Brett, and berries. Similar to a Flanders red. Tart and sharp, but not overpowering.
Flavor is delicate and complex; superbly balanced. Wine, tobacco, grapes, a light but musty funk carrying an edge of cheese, berries, just a bit of vinegar. Very, very light sweetness, and a light, lingering sourness.
Lively and tart, slick and oily, medium-light but smooth and definitely a sipper. Surprisingly wet finish.
An absolutely superb sour, ticking all the right boxes. Reminds me of a vintage Rodenbach in its balance, complexity, and subtlety. 754 charactersRoguer, Nov 17, 2013

intoxicating aroma
outstanding depth, so many nuances you can focus on
plum, sour cherry, oaky, vinous
delicious
the flavor is up to the task promised by the scent
one of the few brews that makes my mouth water while drinking it
all the fruits, tart to perfection, sometimes tobacco
mouth tingling shy of medium
simply fantastic

The aroma is an amazing wine, sour mix. The taste is the best BA wine brew I have ever had. I truly feel this beer is incredible. It's like an awesome beer and wine were mixed perfectly. A top notch, World Class beer that the brewmasters at RR should be proud of. I would buy this again in a second. Just wow! awesome beer!

Appearance is dark ruby, mahogany, clear but hard to see through. No head.

Taste is dark fruit, currants, red wine tannins, tart, some oak character. 
Mouth feel is medium light, dry finish like a wine. Prefect amount of light carbonation.

Appearance: No head to speak of. Hazy, vermilion on the bottom, the beer becomes more burnt orange toward the top. Really beautiful colors here.
Smell: A bit of oak, a hint of funk. Smells sour, like I'd expect a flanders oud bruin to smell. I can get a bit of red wine in there too, maybe a little brown sugar. I like this more than I do most sour smells.
Taste: Wow, thats sour. I'd say it's a vinegar kind of sour, which isn't bad in this context. Perhaps lemon might be a better way to describe it. The currants this is supposedly aged with aren't really coming through. Closer to the end I begin getting some of the red wine character. The tiniest bit of bitterness, but also a little bit of sweetness on the end. This style of sour isn't my favorite, but this is very nice.
Mouthfeel: Really nice. Lots of carbonation, which is awesome in this style. It's light and very drinkable. 
Overall: Glad I finally got a chance to try this after months of begging my californian friends to send me some. Really solid brew. Not sure I'd seek out a whole lot more of it, but it's very good. 1,242 charactersWTKeene, Oct 08, 2013

A: Amber colored is the best way to describe it. A tiny bit of lacing. Poured with a loose head that dissipates. Pretty beer.
S: light fruits. Definitely smells of apple and pear and smells sour.
T: The sourness on this is perfect. It's delicious and not overdone. Congrats to them for not having a contest on making the most sour beer. Anyway, also taste of apple and some plum. Delicious.
M: Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. Can't believe its 10%. The layered flavors mesh well at the end and make this a real treat.
O: Being that I live on the east coast it's a bit of a bummer I won't be able to try this again soon. I very much enjoyed it and would be happy to have it again. 749 charactersGivemebeer, Sep 21, 2013

Russian River Consecration: wild ale aged in cab barrels with currants added, aged 4 to 8 months, 10% ABV, popped with a smoky haze, soda-like carbonation, head fades instantly to nothing; Appearance: deep reddish brown with dark sediment, constantly rising bubbles; Smell: grape must sourness upon opening bottle, lots of sourness, dark grapes, tart cherry, tartaric acid, currant, hint of lime, faint woody note; Taste/Mouthfeel: very complex, starts out with a sharp acid and Acerola cherry (short, yet strong), followed by a big fruity Cabernet dryness with pronounced leather as it passes the front of the tongue, finish for this overlaps next flavor set, finally banana peel and more bright acid, which finishes slowly, long and low; really good.
Poured into a pint glass. 829 charactersTruePerception, Sep 01, 2013

4.73/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Pours a dark amber red with a lot of fizz and little head to speak of. Not much lacing and a lot of apparent (champagne-like) carbonation. 
Lots of red fruit (cherry, currant) with big red wine nose. Lactic is big. Tart apples. Sour fruits. blah blah blah. Smells and looks like an fruity oud bruin. My kind of beer. Can't wait. 
This is phenomenal. I like this much better than Supplication. Flavors are bold, very complex, and quite tart. The wine flavor is big but not overpowering. Definitely get the red grape on the back end and even some tannin bitterness. Sour cherry and currant again, naturally. I also get a vinegar flavor, but it's subtle. Not exactly red wine vinegar, but almost balsamic. Or is it apple cider? I can't put my finger on it. Absolutely incredible flavor. 
Mouthfeel is great. Medium bodied, high champagney carbonation. Tannin on the backend.
This is an amazing sour. I defiantly have a world yet to explore, but this is the sour flavor (at least) I have been looking for. Perhaps it's a more obvious beer than supplication (the only other RR sour I've had), but I appreciate that aspect. I really really enjoy this. 1,149 characterslunarbrew, Aug 21, 2013

Batch 001X2
This bottle comes from one of the best traders out there, BitterBill, thanks again Bill! Consecration pours like a Coke with the same dark body bordering on black with burgundy highlights and a fizzy, easily rising dirty tan head. The head rose to two fingers in height and fizzled rather quickly to a solid cap with streams of active carbonation rushing up the sides of the glass to revive the suds. Cascading drink lines stick to the snifter after each swig.
The nose on this wild is insanely interesting and unique. Huge notes of currants and buttery oak simply jump from the glass. The aromas stack like legos. Under the barrel aging and currant addition there are deep notes of cabernet, black cherry, an earthy cocoa, and a squeeze of lactose. The oak aging brings vanilla to the table and I keep getting a hint of black licorice that, oddly enough, seems to fit near perfectly. Along with some warming walnuts start to show themselves; crazy. Consecration gets my smeller working overtime.
Tartness washes over my tongue from the get go, just enough to cause a little pucker. Currants again take the lead throughout. A touch of cola sweetness comes across mid palate. The complexities are nearly dizzying. The oak meshes with the cabernet, vinous flavor and the currants perfectly. Zesty black cherry hits on the swallow along with a touch of anise and dusty cocoa. I wouldn't have expected to find the anise and cocoa qualities in this beer but they work amazingly well. I've only begun to scratch the surface on the complexities of this brew.
The body is incredibly light and airy when taking the abv into consideration. Each drink just rolls across the tongue with ease while a lively, but far short of prickly, carbonation works its magic. The finish is tartly sweet; impressive.
There is not a touch of noticeable alcohol in this beer which makes it a dangerous drinker. The flavors keep me coming back as soon as the last drink is swallowed. The tartness on the finish keeps me coming back for more.
Russian River does it yet again with this incredible brew. Consecration is an incredibly unique libation that I honestly can't get enough of. I will be getting more bottles in the future, without a doubt. Thanks for this treat, Bill! 2,271 charactersjoe1510, Aug 19, 2013

I can't get enough of this aroma. Extremely sour and tart. Dark fruit some sweetness and a little bit of spice. A really complex aroma. I can't wait to start sipping.
Wow. Amazing flavor. Extremely complex. Sweet and puckeringly tart at the same time. Very acidic. A little bit like Smarties or SweetTarts, but much more sour.
Thin to medium bodied beer with a highly carbonated and slick mouthfeel. A very very dry everlasting finish.
An excellent sour beer. One of the best I've had. Though, I like Supplication better. This one is darker and much more harsh on the tongue. 667 charactersUnderPressure, Aug 14, 2013

wonderful aroma of deep oak and red cabernet wine with a nutty aroma as well.
Taste is initially brown and caramel malts but is soon followed by sour and tart flavors that are so clean and devoid of vinegar. the barrel really shines through to the point where i forget im drinking a beer. 
the mouthfeel is slick and smooth just leaving a hint of carbonation on the tongue.
overall it's wonderful and truly bridges the gap between beer and wine imo. glad i have one more but wish i had more than that 603 charactersMRsojourner, Aug 13, 2013

S- Thank God the smell is a vast improvement over the look! Tons of sour and funky notes. Barnyard funk and hay are prevalent, with tart cherries coming through big as well. A good bit of granny smith apple, and a touch of dark fruits (figs/currants/raisins etc.). This smells like it will be a delicious tart monster!
T- Wow, this is crazy with tons of tartness and unexpected flavors! It's definitely more boozy than expected. White grapes and the cabernet barrel is definitely evident. The tart cherries and granny smith apples are there as well. The tart bite is a bit much and isn't balanced quite enough with other flavors. Don't get me wrong, I love mouth puckering sours, but this just is lacking that extra something to make it world class.
M- The mouthfeel is thicker than most sours, but w/ the high abv this is understandable. Decent carbonation and a distinct boozy finish round it out.
O- Overall this is a very good sour that could just use some refinement and balance. 1,112 charactersSadMachine, Aug 08, 2013

Pours a translucent purple-red with no visible head. Plenty of streaming carbonation.
Smells sour red fruit and chocolate.
Taste turns out just fine. Sour and oak, with an underlying flavor that I can only assume is the currants.
Overall, another solid American sour from RR. But at $12 a bottle, not something I would seek out again. I sincerely wish they would cut the cost of these brews in half to make them somewhat affordable. 630 charactersthebigredone, Aug 01, 2013

Appearance- Dark mahogany/tawny with quick half finger off white head that left a nice ring around the top.
Smell- Big. Definantly some currant up front mixed with the red wine barrel. Tart plums and oak with mild funk. Malt forward smell. Rich with dark fruits abound.
Taste- Plums, currants, cherries, oak. Sweet and malty with light snap of tartness that fades into straight currants and cherries. Great lingering tastes. Very rich and full. Very light booze taste.
Mouthfeel- Well carbonated with medium thickness. Very full feeling. Light tartness, not enough to make a face pucker. 
Overall- Very nice barrel aged fruit forward wild. Reminiscent of Crooked Stave's sour quad. A good candidate for sharing with another person. 804 charactersSeanniek91, Jul 29, 2013

I poured slowly per the bottle's instructions. I receive a half finger of dull tan colored head that dissipates almost as soon as I'm done pouring. This leaves no froth on top, but a constant flow of bubbles is noticed on the surface. No lace.
It smells of red wine, cherries and raspberries. 
The taste is red wine and raspberries. You get a little funk as well, almost like a light dank woodiness. The alcohol is well disguised.
This is rather light bodied. It goes down quickly and leaves a film on your tongue. 741 charactersCFHMagnet, Jul 26, 2013

Poured a reddish dark brown color with one finger of khaki white head when I got it. Below average foggy lacing on the sides. Minimal-to-bad retention on the top. 
Smelled dark cherry, black cherry, sour cherry. So cherry. Also raspberry, red wine (Cabernet?), purple grape and plum.
Tasted similar to the nose, but better. Got sour cherry, black cherry, Cabernet red wine, sour grape, plum and raspberry. Very smooth. 
Medium body. Oily texture. Soft carbonation. Long, smooth finish.

It does so many things well. The wine and vinous qualities definitely shine in the aroma as well as flavor. The currants add a nice amount of complexity, with the sourness being refreshing and crisp. 
This beer is a sipper and one to ponder over, but the drinkability makes it hard for me to savor it. Simply marvelous. CANNOT wait to crack open Supplication and compare the two.

4.23/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Enjoyed out of a brown 375 mL cork & cage bottle with a bottling date of 013113. Poured into a Boulevard Smokestack series tulip glass.
Appearance - Gently poured so as not to disturb the yeast sediment, as directed on the bottle. Head is bubbly, like champagne or a soft drink, and beige, about a finger thick. Dissipates within a minute or two with zero lacing and leaves a body of deep garnet-ruby red. Darker, like black plum skin, around the edges. I love the color--so dark and mysterious.
Smell - Black currant, some hints of vanilla and leather, with an underlying acidity and bite. Faint elements of sour cherries as well.
Taste - Tart with the flavors of blackberry, currant, cabernet grapes running through. Some sour highlights, like lemon juice with a hint of cider vinegar. Finishes slightly spicy and with sweeter notes poking through from malt, roasted figs, and dates.
Mouthfeel - Carbonation is aggressive at first, but fades away quickly, leaving a slick mouthfeel punctuated by small tingling sensations. Medium bodied and a dry, tart finish.
Overall, my first taste of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale that went through some sort of souring process. Forward with the overall taste of fruit, but the maltiness sticks up for itself. Not overpoweringly sour, but it definitely has a bit of a kick. 1,313 charactersLambicPentameter, Jul 14, 2013

The mouth feel is fizzy with a pleasant tart puckering. The taste is vinegar and very little malt and granny smith apple peel. In my top five sours of all time and proof that Russian River is one of the best breweries in America. 490 characters3sheets2wind, Jul 09, 2013

Pours a pretty but unremarkable rusty clear medium brown. Just a half-finger of head, fizzling out as it tends to on sours. Just fine.
Smell is big, warm, and red. Potent cabernet aromas, some difficult-to-identify fruit, and the sweetness balanced by a lovely cherry-like tartness. Like a tart, fruity red-wine-beer. Excellent.
Taste is very good, but with a little too much pinch in the sour back-end. Starts out sweet and soda-like, thanks to the fizziness and a sugary amiguously-flavored sweetness. But it quickly slides into sour territory, coming up moderately sharp and fading into a sour-bitter meld that I find a tiny bit bothersome.
Feel is really good. Medium-bodied, with fizzy, prickly carbonation like a fruit soda. Lasting and delightful.
A very good beer, but not my favorite of RR's sours (that remains Supplication). Fruity and pleasant, with just a little too much sour and bitter poking out through the cracks. 1,120 characterszeledonia, Jun 28, 2013

2.6/5  rDev -41%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.25I had a chance recently to review Russian River Brewing Consecration which the owner/operator of Yeasty Beasty in Monmouth, Or. had presented me. These are my impressions:
The bottle feels good to handle. It has a retro vibe with the neck bulging slightly in the middle. The lip of the bottle is thickened so as to accommodate the champagne-style cork made necessary, I suppose, by the in bottle fermentation. The color and labeling are not intrusive and add to the air of subdued refinement.
The first taste showed the cabernet casking strongly. So strong in fact, that I could not find the ale underneath. A second taste revealed a finely crafted, but very complex brew. One that was beyond my meager abilities to dissect. I could not pick apart the strong cabernet taste from a hint of something I am still trying to put a name to, and the ale I knew lay behind the fine carbonation. There didn’t seem to be any top hit of hops. 
Beyond those criticisms, Russian River Consecration is a finely crafted brew. If you are looking for a brew to serve to a group of friends looking to have a few, this may not be it. If, however, you are looking for an immaculately-crafted beer full of surprises, then try this one. 1,220 charactersAirliebeer, Jun 21, 2013

4.82/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5The color is a red brown bubbly beer. It almost looks like a dark Shirley Temple. Tons of big bubbles and carbonation.
The aroma has a sour funk, but there’s tons of wine tannins, lots of vinous, oak, a bit of dark fruit. However, the tartness does really stand out on this. It’s vinegar and Flanders sourness.
The flavor is vinegar tart, but then there’s tons of red wine and then some oak character. The tartness is actually hidden away as the beer warms up and blossoms to become a very red wine flavored beer. There really is not an alcohol flavor as it is like 10% ABV. 
The mouthfeel on this is almost like a Coke-Cola. Tons of large bubbled carbonation that just rolls all over the tongue.
The huge wine flavors mean that you want to share this beer. I wouldn’t want 375ml myself. A good amount is to share it with someone.
This beer really stands out for me having had it next to Supplication. I preferred this actually. It’s so interesting because I’ve never had a beer that has had more red wine character in it that this. This for me is probably the best Wild Ales I have had. What a treat. It’s so different and amazing. 1,152 charactersdar482, Jun 20, 2013

3.75/5  rDev -15%look: 3 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Bottle from strang. Batch 008. From notes.
A - Deep red colour, cloudy with one finger of light brown head that fizzled away fast. Quite effervescent. No lace, no retention.
S - Grapes, plums, Brett, some wood, lemon candy, mustiness.
T - Tart with grapes and not much else. Musty, tart, lemons, not much 'dark' to speak of, it's mostly just a Brett assault. Maybe a tiny bit of dark fruit was there. No alcohol.
M - Strong carbonation, medium to full body, puckering tart finish.
O/D - Enjoyed it. Too bad there couldn't be more malt complexity with the Brett dialed back. Carbonation was also a bit much and made tasting a bit difficult. Not bad for a wild ale though and was pleasant to drink, but didn't seem to break new ground for the style . 753 charactersbylerteck, Jun 19, 2013

4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A: Pours a relatively clear crimson red in color with some heavy amounts of active visible carbonation and some ruby red highlights. The beer has a finger and a half tall fizzy yet creamy tan head that slowly reduces to a thin film covering the majority of the surface of the beer with a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Moderate to heavy aromas of tartness/sourness with dark fruit (cherries and currants) and heavier smells of red wine and oak.
T: Moderately tart upfront with some vinous notes, hints of balsamic vinegar, and a moderate amount of sour cherries. Light to moderate flavors of oak and red wine along with some dark fruits (currant). Moderately tart which lingers in the finish.
M: Medium bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation. Relatively dry in the finish with a heavy amount of acidic prickliness.
O: Reminds me more of drinking a slightly tart red wine than a beer (so to speak) but it is definitely an enjoyable experience. Due to the tartness, it was one that I needed to enjoy by sipping rather slowly but it is definitely a phenomenal beer. Nice job of balancing the sourness with the red wine flavors. 1,189 charactersdbrauneis, Jun 16, 2013

It poured with a finger and a half high dark beige head that gradually died down, leaving wispy lacing on the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass. 
S: Moderate aromas of Cabernet Sauvignon wine barrels are present in the nose along with a slight amount of sourness. 
T: The taste is similar to the smell, except that the wine isn't as prominent and there are also notes of oak and hints of cherries. 
M: It feels medium-bodied and a little acidic on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. 
O: This beer has a good balance for an barrel aged beer and doesn't seem too winey. 702 charactersmetter98, Jun 15, 2013

Pours a deep ruby with soda like off white head. Smells like vinagar with some fruity tones. Tastes like tart plums and blackberries with a little bit of oak and a slight alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is light with fairly high carbonation. I had this beer years ago and hated it but I think I just got a bad bottle...this was very suprising. 371 charactersjoefuzz, Jun 06, 2013
4.41/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I got the last of these available at my local bottle shop. I was super pumped as I had heard so much about it. 
So I was a little disappointed when I first tasted it. The cherries were great but that weird wine after taste just didn't fit. As the beer warmed in my hand, the flavors started to meld. By the end, the beer was closer to 50/55 degF and the flavors which seemed so disparate were working together. And I was wishing I had another. 
I don't know what temp RussiannRiver suggests to drink this, but if/when I drink this again, I will start closer to the temp I drink wine. It made a world of difference to me. 622 charactersDcunicelli, Jun 06, 2013

A - Reddish brown and hazy with a limited head. Lots of bubbles but no accumulation.
S - Lots of sour cherries.
T - A very sour and tart start with a vinous finish. Great complexity. The sourness and the wine notes play off and compliment each other. The 10% alcohol is barely noticeable.
M - A mouthpuckering bite and a carbonation that delivers and disperses the flavors nicely.
D - Complex and addicting. I love this beer. 515 charactersGJ40, Jun 03, 2013

Batch# 013113
A- Pours hazy amber brown with no head at all. Lots of visible carbonation. Some alcohol legs.
S- Sours cherries. Oak. Wheat. Lemongrass. Dark fruit. An impressive nose on this brew.
T- An intense sourness unlike any other. A very puckering beer. A big hay flavor sweeps over this beer, A herbal, grassy flavor to it. A sour cherry flavor to this beer, maybe a little plum and fig as well. This beer is almost like biting into a lemon, a lot of lemon flavor. A great barrel flavor as well, a touch of oak. Imagine a sour champagne. Hides the 10% well
M- Sour as hell. Strong in terms of alcohol feel. An intense beer.
O- This is a fantastic Beer. Strong, and really gives force to the term "sour". A delightfully complex and unique beer. 783 charactersTwelveOunces, May 31, 2013

Definitely has a unique smell of raisin, Cabernet wine, champagne and sour dark fruits like prunes or dates. Initial taste is one of a rolling bubble champagne but complex taste where I really got some of the red wine flavors. Overall very delicious and a fairly heavy hitter for a wild on the alcohol content. 398 charactersalaimoa, May 26, 2013

A: 4.5 - dark (almost blood) red-brown coloration, moderate clarity, quickly dissipating yellow fizzy suds that resolves in seconds to a thin glass lacing, moderare alcohol legs for 10.00% on swirling that reagitates the carbonation
S: 4.75 - lots of cabernet and tannin, lactobacillus sour notes, alcohol aromas that are actually more present in the aroma than the taste
T: 4.5 - as expected, little-to-no hop flavors or bittneness; initial flavors that I'm pulling out are sweet malts with sour flavors on the back end, pleasing aftertaste of sour grapes and tannins; little-to-no alcohol flavors, which is impressive for a 10.00% American wild ale
M: 4.25 - high carbonation that pops flavors into your mouth; lightly bodied; again, the alcohol remains well-masked in the mouthfeel
O: 4 5 - one of the better American sour ales brewed with a concoction of yeast and bacteria; there are some really nice flavors and aromas imparted by the aging in cabernet savignon barrels; however, I am a little underwhelmed after seeing a 99 rating on BA; I picked it up for $13.99 in SF, which, to be frank, is too steep for the quality and have seen it for as much as $30.00 in D.C., which, to be franker, is insane 1,361 charactersMNishCT77, May 24, 2013

S - pedio/lacto sourness, big oak, vanilla, currants, pineapple and red wine.
T - follows the aroma. Acetic. Assertive barrel note. Very smooth 10%.
M - light-medium body. Creamy and slightly oily. Dry. Sour, but not super sour. 
O - I consider this to be an Imperial Flanders with a twist and a very tasty one. Certainly not the most extreme sour, but that isn't a negative coming from a sour head. Brewed with careful restraint, but far from being bland. Very good beer! 557 charactersGuzzLah, May 19, 2013

Not a huge fan of sour beer at this point but i can handle them. This beer is awesome. 10% stands out but the taste is so good. The smell is outstanding. 
I believe its worth the hype. His beer would just get better with age. Rating may be higher if i had my wild ale/sours under my belt. Comparing this with Brux, another wild ale. Brux is avg at best, brrr is $$$.

S- Just like its counterpart, Supplication, the wine barrel aging plays a big roll in the smell. Dark, rich, wine notes come through first giving way to the currents added to the mix. 
T- Wow. Incredibly sour yet a bit of sweet mellowing on the back end. What a dry taste as well. Cherries, currents, and event an interesting malty sweetness going on. 
M- Absolutely no head yet an interesting, effervescent feel to it. Fuller bodied than Supplication yet just as easily drinkable. Still can't get over how dry it is as well. It's in perfect balance. 
O- Wonderful beer. Incredibly complex and balanced. So much going on here and yet so simple. Hard to describe but very easy to enjoy...and has an incredible kick at 10.00%... For a wild, I'll take it!. 
Serving Type- 12oz bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. Thanks for reading. 974 charactersDoc_Hops, May 08, 2013

Great Tawny Port color and nice lacing from a thin cap of head
The aroma of this sour is out of control: tobacco, catty, ashy, faint vanilla, dark fruit, red grape, apple skin, slightly buttery - every bacteria listed on the bottle is represented here. 
The flavor is great and balanced with a surprisingly mild tang. I was expecting a wallop, but it is mild and restrained...even a little subtle. Cookie spiciness, leather, acetobacter?? Very dry finish with no residual sugar to fuck everything up
The mouthfeel is vibrant and lively carbonated. Feels great on the tongue.
Thanks to ETF Fest for this sample! 670 charactershopoilcrazy, May 06, 2013

4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375cc cork and caged bottle, batch 004x1, poured into a Russian River snifter at cellar temperature and quaffed today, 5/4/2013
Aroma: Punched in the face with sourness. Tart cherries, raspberry and blackberry all jammed together. A lot of it reminds me of a good red wine (I assume Cabernet) that's gone sour. And definitely sour grapes, vinegar with a touch of earthiness. That part is like being in a barn, but subdued. I'm thinking that's the Brett funk. Full bodied nose for sure. (4)
Colour: Pours a very dark, opaque reddish brown body with minimal head, though one gets mesermized looking at the film on the surface that's got tons of tiny bubbling and bubbling in spots. It's really cool. The collar is actually quite thick, dense and white. The lacing is superbly thick like the collar, but quickly falls back into the collar. Otherwise, a tasty appearing dark ale. (4)
Flavour: Damn! This is why I love wild ales. Refreshing quantities of tart dark fruits- cherry, raspberry, blackberry, plus some honey and a good bit of the underlying brown ale malts. A good bit of vinegar hits in the middle of the experience, which rather accentuates the sweet and sour clash here. There's even a little bit of oakiness and smokiness in the finish. Overall a very complex, tasty blend of sweet fruits and malt, sourness and even more sour funkiness accentuated by some earthy oak. Truly a pleasure to quaff. (4.75)
Mouthfeel: Thinner medium bodied brew with excellent, and I truly mean excellent carbonation. It fizzes all over my mouth, coating my palate with pure sourness and earthy funk. It truly feels like a thicker, sour wine yet it brings more to the table than a merlot that's been sitting out for too long. The carbonation is fantastic and the finish is stunningly fizzly and clean yet it leaves my palate with a nice oaky, earthy aftertaste that I savor. There is absolutely no indication that this beer is a 10%. None. It's almost perfect. (4.5)
Overall: Another awesome AWA by Russian River. It's definitely a beer that any wine lover would enjoy, and absolutely a beer that any sour lover will love. It borrows a lot of characteristics of the used Cabernet barrels, but the base malt really makes itself known amidst all the sour, dark-fruity and earthy funkiness. There's a lot going on here that comes together very well, and it's truly an excellent bottle of beer to drink. (4.5) 2,400 charactersStevedore, May 05, 2013

Of course, the last Russian River beer we drank, also a sour beer, that used Brett was amazing. I hope this one is, too. Sheryl asked me what Brett was. For those of you that don't know, Brettanomyces is a wild yeast strain that is known for having earthy flavors. Think about a barnyard… now lick the ground. That is what that yeast strain is famous for. Some like it… I don't.
Today's beer is aged in red wine barrels, specifically cabernet sauvignon barrels. Not a big wine guy, but know enough about the stuff to recall the flavor of the stuff. Hopefully some of those notes carry over here, too. I like sour beers, and I hope this one delivers. After this bottle, only one more Russian River beer on the list! 
In the Glass: It almost looks like Diet Coke in the glass. It is thin, near black, and leaves a very thin white head. No lace to speak of, and the bubbles are so tight that you would think this is soda. I like Diet Coke, so maybe I will like this beer. I actually hope I like this beer, as the typical breadwinners for them aren't that impressive. 
Nose: I could smell this as I was pouring it, and all I could smell was sour notes. When smelling the beer itself, it has some dirty/earthy flavors, but I guarantee that is from the yeast. The sour is obvious, but not overwhelming. It smells good. Speaking of smelling good, I REALLY want to start a company making scented candles. They would all smell like beer! Imagine coming home to a house smelling like your favorite IPA! That, or I could just sprinkle hope around the house. Either way!
Flavor: Based on what I was smelling, I didn't expect it to be this sour. But the sourness keeps coming until you swallow. It's a bit too cold, but the sourness is pretty intense. If you don't like sour beers, BEWARE! This is candy tart and leaves a lingering finish that is, with each swallow, just as tart. I like it!!! 
I am getting some of those wine barrel notes toward the end. I am sure that some of that are the currants used in the brewing process, but some of those full-bodied characteristics that I expect when drinking a glass of red wine are shining through. It says on the bottle, "4 to 8 months" in regards to the time spent in the barrels. I wonder how the brewmaster decides just how long to age each batch. 
Mouthfeel: The first half of the palate is bored, but when the sour flavors start to kick in toward the back of the palate, things begin to get interesting. As this beer is heating up, the sour is starting to become lip sucking sour; almost too much to bear. This is NOT a beer that you will drink more than 1 or 2 of in one sitting. The ABV, coming in at 10.5%, is hidden, so even if you could drink a lot of this, you wouldn't be able to! 
Aftertaste: The aftertaste hangs around for a few minutes, and for the first handful of sips, remains quite sour. I would love to give a sip of this to someone that never drinks craft beer just to see his or her reaction. Tom, a buddy from Old Town, is starting to get into craft beer. I bet he would like this offering. 
That is two Brett beers in a row that I have enjoyed. Maybe my palate is coming along. Speaking of Brett, I am texting Jazz, a beer nut from Total Wine, and he is sitting at World Of Beer. He goes to ASU and it's close… forgive him. He said someone just turned in an appellation and said her favorite beer was Blue Moon. Ha! I laughed. 
Anyway, well done Russian River. You have outdone yourself yet again. We need to plan a trip to California so we can start visiting some of these brewing companies. Cheers! 3,637 charactersrickyleepotts, Apr 29, 2013

T- Caramel, toasted malts, vinegar, sour dark fruits, oak, spices and light pepper.
M- Medium body and high carbonation. Effervescent, acidic, and some dryness at the finish.
O- 7/10 sourness. Another good sour from RR. Light sweetness, with vinegar and dark fruits make this a well balanced sour. I would take Supplication over this but this is still close. 641 characterskawilliams81, Apr 23, 2013

Pours a surprisingly brownish-amber color that is coated with lightly tinged reddish tones, to the say the very least. The colors seem to be interchangeable depending if it's in the light or not, but it's exactly what I'd expect given the base beer and Cabernet barrels used (as well as the currants). Carbonation is lively depending highly on the pour, but in my case I got about a tiny, modest coat of white head that quickly dissipated and left behind streaks of bubbles underneath. In fact, when extra yeast was added, such bubbles would actually rise to the top and pop! It's clear and viscous like wine or any great Lambic I've had in the past, and is very hazy from the start. Looks very unique, and very intriguing.
The aroma is pretty ridiculous, however, and given that this is a pretty wild recipe to begin with, I can't say I'm surprised what I got myself into. At the front there's an instant charge of mustiness combined with soured, almost pickled fruitiness, consisting of apricots, oranges, sour grapes, lemon, and lots of upfront, jubilant phenols. The currants are definitely doing their job here, although it's pretty subtle, just like the Cabernet vinous phenols are. Lots of oak charges up the nostrils, combined with a lot of funk and stinging sensations caused by all the wild yeasts in this. The Brett is obvious, but the Pediococcus is really sharp here, no doubt due to the wood and wine texture underlying the beer base. Really unique and fascinating, but totally intense.
Wow, the flavor is really something else, not just in the realm of sours, but RR beers as well. There's an instant, overflowing sour sharpness that takes over the palate, and coats it with all kinds of fruity esters, ranging from cherries to berries to apple tart to apricots to acidic sweet grapes... And on and on and on. Absolutely juicy tasting, but it does eventually fade and get melded with grape must and sour bacteria-induced woodiness, and then finishes with a brown ale flavor that is crisp but definitely not as over-the-top as the initial rush. Huge vinegar notes too. The bacteria strains are doing something phenomenal here... But I also have to credit the Cabernet must and white oak for rounding up the flavor to something more complex. The currants don't seem to be very present, but I think they did a good enough job. The oak, in fact, adds this vibrant texture that is very tannic and tea-like, almost to the point where my friend who I split this with told me it reminded her of kombucha. With the yeasty funk and tartness, I can totally see that. Alcohol is scarily hidden at 10%. Refreshing, and crisp to drink. The acidity never becomes grating, although the wood does get overly astringent. Wild and rustic as any beer in this style should be. NOTE: I highly recommend not pouring the dregs into this. The Lactobacillus in particular puckers up the joint in an acidic manner that is interesting but mutes a lot of the subtle nuances.
Wow! This definitely is very different from other sours I've had, and is a totally different beast compared to Supplication, for instance. There's less focus on fruit or tart and lot more on grape must, oak melding properties, and bacterial funk. Not my favorite, but really refined and perhaps unlike any American Wild Ale in the country. I will be sure to save another one of these for a special occasion. It's not as accessible, and definitely for wine fans (such as myself) and of the strange and sour stuff, but it's definitely a must for people looking to get into more ambitious beer styles. World class stuff, in my view. 3,749 charactersmagictacosinus, Apr 21, 2013

Okay, this one was a bit over my head as it is true connoisseur Ale, but it was an amazing tasting. Deep ruby red color, strong aroma of stone fruits,nicely effervescent and really wakes up your palate with a tremendous currant flavor that is incredibly tasty, with a nice dry finish.
There is a delectable tartness that is unique to this Wild Ale.

Pours a gorgeous copper red color with a ton of bubbles, but the head is not out of control like you would expect from the amount of carbonation. Thousands of tiny white bubbles shoot from the bottom of the glass up towards the top, quite a sight to behold. Just about the perfect looking beer. Aroma is out of this world. Its got sweet cherries and grapes that you can smell from feet away. Taste is so tart, i love it! Sour raspberries, cherries, grapes dominate the palate here. I cannot believe this is 10%ABV, i'm blown away. A lingering tartness on the tongue after you swallow allows you to enjoy the flavor for quite some time. High carbonation, medium bodied. Goes down smooth and leaves you desiring to have another sip right away.
Overall we have a world class beer right here. Russian River really knows what theyre doing and may hold the top spot as best brewery in the world with so many quality offerings. I return to this beer again and again. 1,033 charactersAxnjxn, Apr 04, 2013

On tap, which is the basis for this rating, it was one of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had the pleasure of smelling/drinking.
It's a deep reddish-brown color with almost no head. As it sits, there are absolutely no bubbles on top. The smell hits you immediately and it's just unreal. It smells sour, but there is so much more in there. Wonderfully warming oaky notes with some sweetness in the background. You can smell it from across the table.
The initial taste is that of tartness, but just wait a few seconds. Your palate is bathed with this sweetness that is perfectly subtle. The oak erupts and you can taste all those years that these barrels were filled with Cabernet. I don't taste the currants exactly, but I am sure they are contributing to the subtle sweetness.  
This was FAR superior to the bottled versions. I'd buy bottles again, but I will always order it if it's available on tap. 1,001 charactersdwagner003, Apr 01, 2013

Aroma: A tart bouquet of light fruits with a hint of black cherries. There is a very slight oak presence that rounds out the aroma nicely. Something about the aroma feels reminiscent of the warmer summer months.
Taste: A very gentle sour that rewards the palate with hearty flavors of fig, apple, raisin, and black cherry that are all moderately tart. The oak character comes out near the finish and the aftertaste is both sweet and tart with a small amount of heat from the otherwise undetectable 10% ABV. The tartness is at its most aggressive at the start and becomes less and less present from the finish to the aftertaste. Quite a nice balance overall.
Mouthfeel: Lighter than medium on body possible part of an illusion created by the soda-like carbonation. However, it does have quite a smooth and easy drinkability.
Final Thoughts: This is only the third or fourth sour I've had but it was very good and easily approachable for any craft drinker. I would hazard a guess that the oak aging has really smoothed out the flavor. Would I drink it again? Yes, but it's definitely a special occasion type of beer. 1,226 charactersJamesMN, Mar 25, 2013

Smell of cherries, raspberries, currants and spice. 
Taste is delicious, fruity, sour but yet can taste the cab in the back of throat. 
Mouthful is medium, lightly carbonated.

A- Pours a clear amber body with a fizzy white 2" head that rises and reduces quickly to leave zero lacing or head.
S- Smells similar to the other RR wilds, but it's a little more wine-forward. I get an acidic berry/cherry/fermented fruit aroma with leather, wood, must, and dry red wine. Some spices and vinegar are in the background. Smells awesome. 
T- Quite tart with sour cherry, green apple, and woody oak notes upfront that develop into red wine (cabernet is definitely present). Red wine vinegar and musty notes are in the background. Leaves a sour taste on the palette. No booze detected.
M- Medium-light body. Medium-low carbonation. 
Another world class impression of the American Wild by RR. The cabernet barrel aging really adds a whole new dimension of complexity to this beer. Well done. 898 charactersgcamparone, Mar 21, 2013

A: Cherry coloration with a very thin lacing of head. The beer is actively moving in the glass; a geyser rises from the middle and and turbulates the beer. Light legs.
N: Sour cherry, currant, powerful acids. Very vinous, plenty of wine grapes, and the oak is noticeable. Light blackberry. New leather and some funkiness.
T: Wow, lots of currants. There's a pleasant sour pie cherry in the background, and the oak and acids are moderated well. Some tangerine /lemon zest. I do get some light tobacco/leather flavors. Grapes and a little bit of raisin. Has a lot in common with the cabernet sauvignon barrel.
M: Light and very, very well carbonated. I am getting a surprising amount of alcohol, though. 
O: A sterling beer that I've passed over too many times to count. While off chasing the newest sour from around the block, Consecration beckons us back to its sublime, balanced fruitiness. Delicious. 932 charactersSarlacc83, Mar 16, 2013

4.41/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 091412. Poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Pours a clear blood red with a short burst of off-white head dissipating almost immediately. No lacing. 
Smell: Oak, red wine, dates. Good strong acidity to the smell. Definitely some barnyard in there as well. Very strong, delicious aroma, and stays nicely balanced.
Taste: Acidity hits right away, accompanied by red wine, oak, raisin. A little bit of subtle caramel actually sneaks in at the end, which surprised me, but adds to the complexity. The pungent tartness sticks all the way through. No alcohol presence - I had no idea this was 10% abv when I first tasted it.
Mouthfeel: Pretty full-bodies as far as sours go, but still finishes very dry. Acidity clings to the palate and puckers you up as you swallow. 
Overall: Phenomenal sour. Brings a strong pucker without being overwhelming. The wine barrels are very complementary to the base sour, and it results in a very complex, delicious beer. 960 charactersemyers, Mar 09, 2013

T: super vinous, tart, acidic. finish has plenty of unfertmented sugars that try to sweeten this massive sour bomb out, with limited success. some dark fruit flavors. little bit of ethanol. after the acid dissipates, there is a slight cereal linger, which is a little surprising seeing as the b
M: a lively carb on a medium/full body. I say medium just cause of how much it has dried out, however knocks you as a 10%'er though. 
D: a nice treat of a wild here. so much acidity, the bacteria really went nuts on all this sugar producing vinous tart flavors and aromas by the boatload. would have been nice to have an aged version to do a side-by-side. maybe next time. 961 charactersJimmys, Mar 01, 2013

Appearance: red-brown color, opaque. lackluster 1/2 finger light tan head dissipates quickly. No lacing.
Smell: Compared to supplication, a less fruit-forward smell. Still nice presence of sour grapes and apples, a hint of red wine.
Taste: Awesome tart taste, sour grapes, granny smith apples, dry cab sauv really comes through and adds to the dryness. 10% ABV very well-hidden.
Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth and drinkable. Smooth, very nice dry finish, not cloyingly sticky.
Overall: A very different beer than supplication, which speaks to the creativeness of Russian River, in my mind. This beer highlights the balance and smooth texture of the ideal AWA and is well-complemented by cab sauv barrel aging. Equally as good, in my opinion. World-class. Enjoy whenever available. 933 charactersMCain04, Feb 23, 2013

A: Pours a deep ruby brown, something like dark amber maple syrup in color. Absolutely zero head, some residual rising bubbles, but no head or lace at all. 
S: The cab barrel jumps to the front on the nose, leather, sour cherries. Cider vinegar, sea water. Pungency really pops as it warms.
T & M (I think it's hard yo separate them in sours): Sharp acidic punch up, buggy, funky, crazy dry. Wisps of sweet and sour fruitiness wane in and out. A dusty basement kick, like the most pungent blue cheese you've had. Really contributes to the puckering Warming up, the wine characteristics show up, oaky tannins, tobacco, hints of smoke. In a word, wild.
O: Still can't handle these all the time, but this certainly is a treat. 815 charactersBraseltonage, Feb 23, 2013

M: Very heavy for a sour with excellent carbonation.
O: Consecration that has been aging for 5 years is the single best sour available. Better then the 6 Cantillons, Duck Duck Gooze, Cable Car, and 8 Cascade beers I've had. 545 charactersjvillefan, Feb 17, 2013

A: dark dark red to brown colored with almost no head and a thin white to gray lacing. This stuff is dark but looks clean despite being completely opaque, the fruit clearly has a effect here
S: There is a slight smell of alcohol that i first detect along with the must of a cabernet barrel that is pretty powerful. I think I can smell some dark fruit in there, but its not pungent and might be a stretch. More barrel then other RR beers I've had but not much else.
T: The first thing i notice is the cabernet barrels give a lighter wine taste then the other RR sours i have had but it is there with plenty of strength and works well. I have never had currents before but you can taste the dark fruit in there as it is quite tart though it is not overwhelming. There is a little sour in there and this reminds me of fruit juice, but the sour lasts through the finish.
M: It is thin and oily but not super oily, there is a small bite from the yeast/barrels but not that much and it could be stronger. Regardless it goes down very easily considering the abv which I can't taste or feel at all. The carbonation's there though lacking as this has more of juice feel.
O: So I really liked this beers but it is not my favorite RR sour. It has some sourness and tartness but not enough imo and could do with a little more carbonation. Though that is really just nitpicking as this is a fantastic beer that I highly recommend. 1,447 charactersPinknuggets, Feb 13, 2013

A- Pours a rubyish light brown color with a 1/2 inch tan head that doesn't retain long at all before fizzing away to a thin ring around the edge of the glass and extremely active patterns of surface foam. Minimal lacing.
S- Moderately sour, crisp aroma with some sweetness and a hint of spice. Mainly fruit notes like cherry, red grape and, of course, currant.
T- Strong tartness, but not too strong, with a decent amount of fruit such as plum, cherry and grape juice. There's a hint of rubbery solvent but it's actually quite complimentary. Also, I couldn't really tell that this is 10% what with the burst of other intense flavors. 
M- Lots of pucker and dryness. Medium carbonation with a body on the full side for the style.
O- Yeah, I definitely dig the darker sours more than the lighter ones. Probably my favorite RR sour to date. 902 charactersImmortale25, Feb 11, 2013

4.19/5  rDev -5%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to GetMeAnIPA for this one... my first RR sour! Consecration pours a pretty damp and dreary copper-brown color with some very slight ruby-red highlights when held in front of a bright light. The head is a murky beige color, borderline light-tan, and dissipates quickly into thin air leaving behind only a little bit of wet legging. I'll tell you this, it's not much to look at really. Kind of dark and musty looking - I guess it fits the style. I was just expecting something a bit more vibrant. The aroma is heavy fruit; currants, grapes, cherries, mixed berries. Very tart on the nose alone. The aroma makes up for the vibrance that was lost on its appearance. Slight wet, woody smell trailing in the back somewhere, but not much (if any) funk or brett. Just straight up tart and sour fruits and vinegar.
Aaaaand the taste is an explosion on the tongue. It is the aroma in "taste" form. You get hit right up front with a strong acidity and balsamic-like vinegar character. Starts off just a bit sour, then quickly the tartness overcomes every corner of your mouth and becomes nearly pucker-inducing. Grapes, berries, plums, currants, cherries, and even a touch of apricot in the finish. Juicy, juicy, JUICY ass fruits; authentic, quenching, tart, and satisfying. I'm sure there are plenty of fruits and flavors I'm missing, as there are plenty of things I can't quite identify - but the harmony between them is pretty amazing.
About halfway through and even earlier when the beer gets warmer, the wood flavors come out - wet, damp, deep oak. Slightly musty and corky, but still, not much on the funky or barnyard side of the spectrum, which might be a good thing - I don't know if I'd want anything else distracting me from this delicious onslaught of gushing, sour fruits. Vinegar becomes even more prominent at the end in the fruity and sweet aftertaste. Alcohol? What alcohol? This beer is 10% ABV? Are you fucking kidding me? No idea how the alcohol is masked this well, but it is. Watch out, this beer will put you on your ass if you're not careful. Medium bodied, crispy and slightly dry with a heavy load of carbonation.
My first RR wild ale, and hopefully not my last. This was some seriously good shit. So satisfyingly tart, sour, and sweet with a perfect flavor profile of authentic fruits. Insanely drinkable for such a high ABV. Ridiculous. 2,364 characterstectactoe, Feb 07, 2013

Aroma is definitely unique. You can definitely smell the sour yeast and the wine aroma from the aging, an interesting yet beautiful combination.
The taste is a bit of a shock for those not familiar with sour ales. You instantly feel the pucker and the sides of your cheeks being sucked in. This quickly fades to the dry flavor of Cabernet while the sour lingers on the palate. I like the concept, but I'm not 100% sold on the flavor. I know it is a sour ale, but the sour is a little overpowering of the really good wine backing.
The mouth feel is a little bubbly. I think this would work better with a little less carbonation.
A good beer, but not one I am inclined to drink regularly. 807 charactersLabeorphile, Jan 18, 2013

A: Thin layer of bubbles instantly disperses. Murky dark orange color. It's pretty.
S: The first thing is wine, some acidity, a little lemon and a little cherry, the wine thing is pleasantly sweet. The sweetness and the lemon together make me think of lemonheads.
T: Not as sweet as the nose. It's bittersweet and it tastes really good. Starts off enjoyably sour, my mouth got used to it pretty quick and it turned into nice tartness with little kick of acidity at the end. I can tell there're a lot of flavors going on but I'm not discerning enough to say what they are. Overall it tasted kind of floral. One weird thing I tasted in the beginning is Worcestershire.
M: Not as smooth as I'd like. I noticed the carbonation. Not thin but I'd prefer it a little thicker than it is. I can tell that it's 10% in the back of my throat.
Overall I enjoy it. I'm fairly new to sours but this reassures me that it's a style that I reeeaally like. I really enjoy the wine character and it makes me want it to feel more velvety. This was my first Russian River and all of the hype I've read and heard seems merited to me! 1,197 charactersabenf, Jan 11, 2013

Pours a muddy red with high carbonation, no head at all and moderate lacing. Aroma of sour cheery, apple, citrus, with a sweet malt backbone. All the standard ingredients to a sour. Taste follows the nose well, sour cherry, tart apple, grape, oak, berries, sweet malts, and some alcohol. Feel is full bodied with a good tingle on the tongue. Very juicy, makes my mouth water.

S: A blast of sour funkiness blends well with dark fruits and a light tobacco aroma. Very inviting.

#36
Bottled Date: 9/14/12
A: Magohony brown with hues of currant red. Slowly poured into a large wine glass with minimal head but active carbonation.
S: Acetic acid berry sweetness with layers of wood and tobacco in the background. Mostly a sour prickling sensation in the nose which let's me know that there is going to be a sour astringent kick to this brew.
T: Sour berry sweetness with a balsamic vinegar astringency up front. There are also notes of sea salt, wood, leather, prunes and tobacco with a middle layer of chewy brown bread. Some warming vinous alcohol comes through in the finish. Overall mostly sour with a pleasant sweetness, hint of saltiness and beautiful layers of subtlety from the Cab barrels and malt. 
M: Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation which really adds to the overall experience of the brew.
O: I love the Russian River sours which really showcases the ingenuity, creativity, and wine background of brewmaster Vinnie Cilurzo. Consecration marries a dark sweetness with a balsamic vinegar bite with wonderful subtleties inbetween. 1,104 charactersElSid, Dec 19, 2012

Smells of lemonheads and cherry clan like most of RR sours but this is heavier on the cherry side. A touch or tart Chardonnay as well. 
Taste is much different than the other RR sours and opposes the nose. Quite the variation of flavor ranging from Chardonnay and wet horse blanket to mildly tart cherries and finishing with a dry wheat like character. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Pretty dry yet fairly tacky. 
Overall this is far better than I thought it'd be. Not bad. 602 charactersMrVonzipper, Dec 06, 2012

A: Dark brownish red. High carbonation with a lot of carbon activity. Head dissipated extremely quickly, completely cone in a few seconds. Very very clear beer, good looking brew for sure minus a lacking head. 
S: Light fruitiness, sweet, brown sugar, dried fruits and extremely clean sour character to the nose. Very mild smell, I was expecting some alcoholic notes for its abv but I get none surprisingly. Smell is extremely light and pleasant, almost strange but in a good way. 
T: Sour, fruity and slight tart with some good bitterness. Dried fruits (currants) come through very mildly, balances with the tartness and bitterness just right, oh so good. Slight alcoholic to the taste but comes a bit towards the end after the tart fruit. Also a tad bit flowery but hides behind the bitterness and dominating sour character, of course, but again RR setting the bench mark for American Wilds. Great fit to the style yet creative and unique. I'm liking the subtle flavor put fourth by adding currants. 
M: Dry, slight alcoholic but no where what I was expecting for a 10% abv, definitely hidden well. Very subtle floral and currant/dark fruit character. Very balanced yet complex and still drinkable, I can kill a 750 ml bottle of this if available. 
O: Great example of what's possible for this style. A very friendly brew that it full of flavor yet simple enough to enjoy on a regular basis if more readily available or if my wallet and gas tank could afford it. But regardless, great beer that I will continue to drink as often as I can visit our good friends over in Santa Rosa CA. 1,633 charactersMarioM, Nov 20, 2012

T- Very sour with wine notes. Very nice with some non-beer essences. Sour and sweet all at once. 
M- Very light and vinous feel. Heavily carbonated.
O- Never had a beer like this. Good beer. Making me excited to try more Russian River. 503 charactersMurrhey, Nov 15, 2012
4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750mL b1 poured into tulip a clear, deep mahogany (cloudy brown with the yeast tossed in). Head is extremely temporary tan that evaporates. No lacing. Aroma is heavy on oak barrel character, port wine, sherry, sour cherries, a bit of spiced rum or whiskey. Amazing. Taste is mouth-puckering sour cherries, sherry, a bit of vinegar, warhead sour candies, a bit of warming alcohol towards the end. Palate is very much red wine: lots of Cabernet Sauvignon/blackberry/blackcurrant throughout the taste and palate. One of my favorites in the RR sour series. More robust than Supplication. Not as soft as Temptation and Sanctification. 629 characterstarheels86, Nov 13, 2012

A- Pours a reddish slightly purple brown with pretty much no head. Slightly translucent and about average carbonation. Not too much in terms of lacing.
S- Red wine presence contributed by the cabernet sauvignon, grapes, some cherries, a hint of oak, light grap tartness. Fairly aromatic. Well balanced and smells very good for a sour.
T- Tart grapes, cabernet sauvignon wine, a bit of tobacco, some light cherries and other dark fruits, some subtle spices. Finishes with a light tartness and lingering taste of currants.
M- Fairly full bodied for a sour, nice carbonation that plays well with the tartness, very easy drinking, does not feel like 10% at all. 
O- This was a very nice sour that had a great wine presence to it. There was a nice fruity tartness to it. It's definitely one of the better sours I've had and I enjoyed it more then the Temptation we had right before this. I highly recommend checking this beer out. 1,002 charactersjaasen64, Nov 10, 2012

S: Dominating red fruits, dried fruits. Wood, vanilla, a bit of alcohol, well incorporated. The redcurrant dominates with also dark fruits aromas (prune).
T: The palate follows mainly the nose, with a good sourness which enhances the redcurrants notes. Balanced by a slight woody sweetness. The finish is much more on red / black fruits (blueberry, grape, blackberry, cherry).
M: Light carbonation, a bit puckering at the attack on the palate. The alcohol is well incorporated but still quite present.
O: A good sour ale, with an progressive taste. Even if redcurrant is not particularly my thing, I found the palate is even more interesting than the nose. It offers a very nice balance between sourness, woodiness and fruitiness. 831 charactersFux, Nov 05, 2012

4.21/5  rDev -4.5%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours a deep, reddish color with a small, off-white head. Head is gone quickly, with little lacing. Very hazy and effervescent. Carbonation streams to the tops and bubbles for a good while after the pour.
S- Scent is mostly tangy and of sour tones. Most prominent fruit flavors are of cherry or cherry-like fruits. Small amounts of sweetness on the back end. No traces of alcohol on the nose.
T- All sour and funk up front. Dark fruit flavors are the only discernible flavor profile outside of the sour. Transitions into a more tart and acidic sour flavor before moving toward a darker, duller, almost malty flavor. Hints of the yeast flavors are mixed in at the end, and it ends without much sour lingering, but will hints of alcohol dullness.
M- Crisp and light in body, but heavy and punishing in flavor weight. Overall, easy to drink, but would absolutely destroy your palate with sour after a while.
Overall, another world class beer from Russian River. Maybe not quite as good as Supplication, but still a very good sour. 1,034 charactersboilermakerbrew, Oct 27, 2012

A: Beautiful deep cabernet reddish brown with a nice one finger head upon pouring that diminishes almost immediately. Leaves little to no lacing as you drink it down. 
S: Unbelievable nose of oak, currants, leather, dark fruits, slight brett funk, and vinegar. 
T: Exactly what I was hoping for! It follows in the footsteps of the nose but is so much more complex. It starts off with a nice tart and vinegar sourness with a hint of leather that mellows into plum, currant, chocolate, truffle earthiness, cherries, and cranberry. It finishes with a little tinge of oak and red wine. There is a nice warming effect mid taste from the alcohol that does not burn or linger. Just enough to let you know its 10% abv.
M: Medium-full body with the perfect amount of carbonation. Coats your tongue and pallet perfectly so you can pick up on all of the nuances. 
O: Such a fantastic beer. I'm glad I had one of the older batches that has had time to develop. I could see this beer having a more upfront sourness and vinegar taste. Since it had time to mellow out a bit the sourness is quite faint and upfront. It allows the flavors of the dark fruits, chocolate, and oak to really shine in the finish! 1,261 characterssilentdonkey, Oct 24, 2012

A-An uninspired light brown, one-finger head recedes almost immediately and leaves very little lacing. The beer is reddish/brown in color and mostly clear. A few visible streams of thick carbonation appear after the head goes away.
S-Tart and vinous. I got tart red fruit like cherries and cranberries. There is a hint of oak and earth...and some vanilla.
T-The taste follows the smell pretty closely, i.e., a pleasing mix of tart red fruit and some oak. It is not the most concentrated taste, but it is pleasing nonetheless. The brew is pretty sweet throughout and the alcohol is well integrated.
M-Not awful...but probably the weak point for this beer. Medium body and a little undercarbonated for my taste. 
O-I like this beer quite a bit, it has a really nice, well-balanced smell and flavor profile that not many brews can match. That being said, the appearance is underwhelming and the mouthfeel is a little dead. 969 charactersspoony, Oct 13, 2012

A: Pours a dark ruby color with a light tan head forming on the pour. It recedes quickly to a thin ring. Not much lace is left.
S: Big sweet currents with mildly tart undertones. Some lighter malts are present with a nice cab body showing itself on the finish of each sniff. Pretty earthy and bold, yet restrained enough to let the beer show.
T: Much more sour than the nose would suggest. There is some lactic sourness with a tart current body. The cab gives some dirty grape punch to cut through the sourness. Just a little bit of earthy and leathery malt to counter balance the tartness as well. As it warms a little more of the barrel comes out with some dry oakiness and light sweetness. The booze is so well hidden. I would have guessed, 6% or 7%.
M: Medium bodied with a nice prickly carbonation. There is a little more body to this beer, but it doesn't take away from the drinkability. The finish is slightly drying.
O: The Cab didn't overtake the base beer which is awesome. It gave it just enough earthy undertones to provide some more depths of flavor. This is right up there with Supplication as my favorite RR sour. The booze is extremely well hidden as well. Well put together. 1,315 charactersTreebs, Oct 13, 2012

The beer pours a relatively clear light brown/dark amber with a razor thin halo of white head. The beer's nose is complex with tart currant fruitiness, buttery oak, and blistering alcohol. As expected, this beer drinks like a fine wine with a tremendous amount of fruit forward flavor, yeast funk and oak. It's a touch too acidic, but the booming flavors pull together and mask the beer's staggering abv. The mouthfeel is puckeringly sour and mostly dry with a touch of initial sweetness. There is a mildly umpleasant funk that lingers, but the mouthwatering sourness cleanses the palate quickly. This is an excellent beer that's worth the hunt! 658 charactersThePorterSorter, Oct 12, 2012

I have to admit, while I really like this beer, I can find similar Belgian offerings cheaper and more easily. It's worth drinking but it's not worth what you have to pay or go through to obtain. 450 charactersJimsArcade, Sep 24, 2012

A - Deep ruby-maple coloring. Soft, light tan head. Quickly reduced down to a ring around the edges. Marginal lacing. Big alcohol legs for a sour.
S - Cherry pits and currant sweetness, lemon acidity, black peppercorn, a touch of oak and cabernet grapes.
T - A rich wild ale here. Well-rounded, ripe currants. Red grapeskins. Strawberry jam. Even unripe blueberries. Light vinegar bite. Moderate sourness.
M - Medium body, high carbonation, semi-dry finish. Definite alcohol warming in the backend.
D - A bigger, juicier sour variant from RR. I'm not sure it has the finesse of Supplication but it touches that nice jam sweetness without offsetting the good sourness. Nice brew, easy recommendation. 792 charactersAuracom, Sep 24, 2012

The pour was a clear deep dark mahogany brown with a small (less than 1 finger) white fizzy head that dissipated in 1-2 seconds and basically had no lacing to speak of.
The aroma was very complex and enticing with a dark grain malt and funky Brett yeast and possessed notes of dark fruit (red grape and black currant), a bit of oak cask and a boldly tart red wine presence.
The taste was sweetly tart and a tad acidic and had strong currant and grape notes throughout, with the finish having a bold and somewhat dry sour wine alcohol taste. The flavor lingered on the taste buds for a bit more than an average duration following the swallow, with a really wonderful sour fruity taste lasting quite a bit longer.
Mouthfeel was right below medium in body with a really smooth dry texture and an almost champagne like carbonation.
Overall I can not express how much I enjoyed this particular brew, it was sweet and fruity yet bold and sour with a fantastic lingering lip smackin’ taste. By far the best Russian River brew I have had to date. I highly recommend if given the chance, that you most definitely give this one a try...

Appearance: Pours a relatively clear garnet with some deeper brown hues. Head is off-white and drops to a small bubbly collar in short order. Minimal carbonation. Deep reds.
Smell: Big hit of wine. Cabernet jumps and drops a big grape/wine punch. That distinct Russian River level of lactic sour. Some nice leather and dark cherry as well. Mild citric backing. Some vinegar as well. Oak and a big floral hit. Almost chocolatey at times. Some underlying malty sweetness.
Taste: Massive oak. Sherry, Cabernet, and some cider vinegar. Acetic with a nice level of citric and lactic sour. Mild funkiness builds as the beer warms. Some nice grass and some caramel sweetness mild chocolate is masked by a bigger punch of leather and dark fruit. Tart cherry. Oak. Woody with a mild dampness. Tart. 
Mouthfeel: Minimal carbonation laced through a nice, smooth body. Lingering tart dryness.
Overall: Great. A nice blend of sour and sweet and wine. 
I've tried this several times. The old bottles are insane. So complex and interesting. The newer bottles are great as well, but they push a lot more acetic and tart. Not a bad thing, just a thing. 1,228 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Sep 16, 2012

A - Dark, reddish brown with a tiny white head that only sits in the edge. The red is definitely the color you would find in a big red wine. Minimal carbonation and rather clean looking
S - Oak, lemon, wheat grass, and currants. Has a tart, almost sweettarts quality to it.
T - Very tart up front with almost a cherry warhead like quality. As the beer moves, it has lemon and oak that come through. The sour, tartness comes through strong in the finish as well as a slight alcoholic bite
MF - Highly carbonated with a medium body. The carbonation goes well with the tartness and helps the flavors linger on the tongue
O - Very tart sour from Russian River with only a slight funkiness to it. This only really brings the tart was but it is almpmost too tart for me to pick up anything else in it. 861 charactersjeonseh, Sep 16, 2012

A- consecration pours lovely reddish brown with flushing to the edges of the glass. A slight haze is evident in the the body the brew. 
S- An AWESOME combination of cherries, earthy scent, tobacco, brett, and oak. Not to mention some other musty fruit and the Cabernet components mingling together. So complex yet so smooth and exponentially spiking with flavor. What a combination of themes going on!
T- a sour taste of cherries are meshed with the tobacco earthiness. Just a splendid wine flavor that blends with the oakiness from the barrel aging. The vast properties of the brew lead to an amazing taste experience. Really smooth and drinkable
M- a bit syrupy but the smoothness of the flavor pulls it through
O- Incredible wild ale that takes so many different properties and delivers with a fantastic brew. Not many beers like this in the world. Will be trying to find a way to get more 975 characterslovindahops, Aug 21, 2012
4.29/5  rDev -2.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4We pop the cage and cork off a bottle of Batch 005X1E, and pour a red, tawny brown. It holds a one and a half finger head of tight white bubbles. This recedes at a medium pace, leaving a tannish ring around the edges of the glass. Carbonation appears active, and bubbles cling around the glass’ walls. No sediment is noted, but a haze permeates the beer. The nose is bright with all the notes expected. Brett sings high over pale and caramel malts, with lactic sourness and bite from booze and yeast. There is a chemically, chlorine airiness on the far back, as well. The currents are sweet and bitter, but are closer to blueberries and raspberries than anything else. The tartness of the Brett sits nice against this raw fruitiness. With warmth come a light toast, and the faintest fruity ester quality. Our first impression is in regard to the intense, puckering sourness of the beer!! As we sip, souring Brett and tart currant berries hit first. This is extremely puckering, but packed with flavor. These sit amongst pale malts, steely caramel, and buttered toast. The middle peaks with sourness, musk, and tannin-like, astringent cabernet sauvignon grapes. The latter adds a drying, but savory juiciness. There is a dirty, earthy quality to it here, too, with mineral, malts, and fat ol’ Brett. The wine continues to the finish, with more sour currants, apple vinegar, light booze, and more Brett. The aftertaste breathes of more of that vinegar, Bretty sourness, and red wine, much like it has throughout the tasting. The body is thicker, and the carbonation is light. Each sip is juicy, wet, and coating. There is nice slurp and smack to each sip, but the eventual winey dryness takes away from what little creaminess there is. The abv is high but appropriate, and the beer sips slowly, as you want to keep it going.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. It was extraordinarily complex, but blended so well that what we were given was a cohesive, definitive end-product. The sourness is gloriously huge, and as in the nose, each taste of it becomes more inviting than the last. Additionally, the 10% abv is almost virtually unnoticeable, allowing space for the yeast and the intrinsic flavorings to work their magic. 2,254 charactersTheBrewo, Aug 20, 2012

Poured into Duvel tulip on July 21, 2012.
Appearance 4
Pours a dark to medium brown with slight plum red tinge. Very thin covering of head that nearly completely dissipates. 
Aroma 4
Tart sour nose predominance, with slight dark fruit/grape note. Also tart candy notes. 
Taste 4.5
Initially a strong tart sourness, which really coats the palate well. Very complex taste. I get notes of sweet malt, tart candy, & lemon. Sourness comes in a quite sharp burst, then drops off, though there is a moderate to strong amount of sourness that lingers on palate throughout. Midway through I can pick up the malt, and late on the palate there is hint of the red wine notes from the barrel. Together, the flavors are great; there is a lot going on, but it is refined and polished. I felt hat the barrel aging adds a balance to the sourness – there is almost a tannin dryness at the end. At the very end, almost in the aftertaste, can pick up the current flavor. 
Mouthfeel 5
Moderate thickness, low carbonation, great almost puckering sourness that coats entire mouth. Nice slight viscosity to the beer. Super enjoyable!
Overall 4.5
Lives up to the hype. Incredible sour with great power, but also great balance. 10% alcohol is extremely well hidden and allows the beer to be more full bodied. Very, very easy to drink. A world class offering – reminds me of Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien. Only wish I could have this as a regular offering – the west coast beer drinkers are lucky. Highly recommend. 1,547 charactersEnemyWithin, Aug 19, 2012

This one has a similar body to Supplication - reddish brown with some small bubbles constantly bubbling, but a thinner head due to the alcohol. The alcohol also cuts some of that tartness while preserving the oaky, cherry notes. Goes down kind of dry like a champagne. 
Realistically, Russian River knocked it out of the park again and they've clearly demonstrated that they dominate not only with IPAs but also sour/wilds. I give the upper hand to Supplication, but try both! 653 charactersTheRealBigC, Aug 18, 2012

Smell – Cabernet, oak, and a hint of sourness.
Taste – Sour, oakey cabernet. A little too much sour to properly complement the cabernet, in my opinion.
Mouthfeel – Tart, very lightly carbonated. I’m surprised this is 10% abv.  Left a sour aftertaste.
Drinkability – An all around decent sour, but I drank it next to a Cuvee des Jacobins, which a lot of other reviewers did, and I think that was better side by side. 524 charactersFalcon91Wolvrn03, Aug 12, 2012

A- Pours a clear, deep reddish brown mahogany color with very fizzy light tan head that very quickly went away leaving no lacing, ring, or cap on this beer. 
S- Smells vinous, funky, and tart all at once. Lots of wooden oak characteristics. Very unique. 
T- Wonderful sourness mixed with a dry red wine. Nice woody, oaky, earthiness flavors that are sticky.

Very dark ruby-amber pour with low carbonation for a bottle conditioned beer. The head is thin and dissipates quickly. The nose is sharp with tart dark fruit notes like cherries and currants. There is also a grapey, wine-like tone to it.
The beer has a medium body, firm mouthfeel, and a strong sour character. Cherry and currant flavors provide a fleeting sweetness and are quickly overtaken by intense sour oaky flavors. The beer finishes dry and acidic, just like a wine, and leaves you salivating for another sip.
Like all of their sours, this gem from RR is worth seeking out. As good as it is, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Supplication, which for my palate has a nearly perfect balance between sweet and sour. This beer is probably more for fans of intensely sour beers. 862 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Jul 26, 2012

T- Incredible flavors on this beer. Considerable tartness, which is lactic and minimally funky, very nice oak barrel and red wine flavors, fruitiness from currants, beneath all of this is a really nice caramel malt center. I'm not getting any booze at all on this, which is pretty awesome for 10% ABV.
M- Medium-bodied, well-carbonated, smooth and a bit sticky, dry finish, great job on this.

Color is good - a garnet red hue that reminds me of a dark cola. Was denied any type of foam at all even though the cork popped off like a bottle of Dom. I'd prefer to see some bubbles here, but not even as much as a glass hugger. No lace of course. Really blows the appearance for me.
Some serious aromas here - it's best attribute. Red wine, dark fruits, sweet pipe tobacco, and woody. The sourness is evident, but not what I'd call inviting. The alcohol is not at all hidden. All this makes for an interesting aromatic ride.
Now for the deal breaker. RR's description of this beer does not deliver the message of "sour bomb", which it is. The sour takes over all the other components found in the aroma and shoves them out the door which is really too bad. Worst tasting brew I've had in ages.
The feel of this beer is pretty chewy, but also lacks the carbonation to balance it out.
This over-hyped concoction was a major let down for me. After wrestling this thing for several swallows of varied volume...it ended in drain pour. A good brew should not make me pucker and salivate profusely. Consecration lacks the all-important balance I search for in a good brew. Now I can say, "Been there. Done that." 1,351 charactersDelMontiac, Jul 04, 2012

The nose is exceedingly tart... subtly funky bits of red wine, fresh grassy notes, overripe fruits, lemongrass, and so much more. I can hear the beer fizzing and hissing as I take each whiff. 
Dark and sour indeed. Very dry wood character smothered with tart wine notes. Sour grapes, abstract acidity, funky preserves, the woody/earthy notes tend to linger.

review #400
pours a deep amber / borderline chestnut tone with ruby highlights while yielding a very short-lived 1/4" tan head. no lacing. bold nose opens with a blast of currants. sour / tart with notes of cherry, vinegar, and maybe a touch of oak.
wow, flavor really impresses, following, even exceeding the aroma. wild ales have never much appealed to me on the whole, but this beer demonstrates what one can be if done right. leave it to russian river to accomplish that feat: just very impressively crafted. sour to the point of slight puckering but not overdone. virtually no trace of the 10% ABV. medium bodied with lively carbonation.
overall, a hell of a sour. of the few dozen or so different wild ales i've sampled, this is on a very short list for overall best. neck and neck with temptation.

S: Wow. Vanilla, oak, Cabernet Sauvignon, tobacco, cedar cigar box... Fruit. Prunes, plums, cherries. I could smell until it got warm trying to name all the smells coming off of this. Easily the most aromatic beer I have ever tried. More like wine than beer. 
T: A sour for sour lovers. This is one of them tooth enamel grating beers. It takes a few sips to re-calibrate for this beer. My first reaction was not that it was delicious. It took me a full 3rd if the beer to get in the mood. And then, once my mouth became accustomed to the low PH, I started getting pulling out what this beer is famous for. Again the smell was so intoxicating that is is hard to tell where smells stop and flavors begin, but this beer has it all. Pie cherries dominant, balsamic vinegar, burnt sugar, stone fruit, dried cherries, currants( obviously), ever so faint of a biscuity malt character is the only indication that this is beer. It's almost overwhelming really. On the complete opposite side of the spectrum from Pliny. My only criticism - and this is a matter of personal preference - is that the beer could have been a couple of points sweeter. The bugs are going to do their worst and best to this so this is largely out of the brewers hands, and I know RR would never back sweeten, but I think just a touch more sweetness would have brought more out of the beer, and helped to moderate the sourness. No trace of ABV whatsoever, amazing considering 10%
M: Thin, dry, Puckery, but with a little silky smoothness. 
O: This is not beer, it's wine. After I finished this I had to switch to wine for the night, there is no way to transition to an IPA or any kind of malt driven beverage after you have one of these. A masterpiece. Thank you. 1,945 charactersBottlebomber, Jun 20, 2012

Balsamic, vanilla, cherries with hint of other dark fruit, growing wood notes as it opens and a touch of funk. 
Sherry tang to end and long twisty linger. Light, crisp, tart.
Insanely complex yet drinkable. The wood very wisely doesn't overwhelm. Almost like a mellowed Rodenbach Grand Cru. 
Continually impressed by RR wild ales. 476 charactersStJamesGate, Jun 19, 2012

Lots of lush, ripe berries up front. Currants, very wine like, some tart raspberry and cherry smells. A touch of oak behind the fruit, but it is almost all fruit.
Taste is nicely tart, with the berry flavor really opening up.
Mouthfeel is dry and tart, but very smooth for 10%, very close to wine in it's mouthfeel.
Overall, another solid offering by Russian River, glad I picked it up, a must try for any fan of sour beers with berry characteristics. 533 charactersquirkzoo, Jun 13, 2012

Through the middle, oak flavors come through with some more dark fruits with some sour cherries and plums.

M - Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a sour and warming finish.
D - Very drinkable. I really like how sour the beer is, but at the same time the balance is still very good. The dark fruits really compliment the sourness nicely. 874 charactersngeunit1, Jun 08, 2012

The beer pours a rich chestnut with deep ruby highlights and fizzy beige colored head foaming up about 2 cm and fading to the thinnest of edge layers at a rapid pace. 
Aroma is dominated by tart fruit, cherries and red grapes with some deeper raisin notes. I actually get a little bit of sweetness mixed in on the nose as well. No hops or ABV hits on the scent.
First sip reveals an average body with fine tingly carbonation. Easy drinking physical traits on this beer.
Flavor is tart and sour fruit through and through the sampling. I get red grapes and plums, unripe plums anyway. A little bit of sweet sugaryness but finishes very dry and tart after each swallow.
the 10% is well hidden by the tartness, making this beer go down a little quicker than may be advised.
A nice sour brew, a little one-dimensional, but it is what it is a fruity tart brew.
Definitely worth trying if you like mouth puckering beers! 1,012 characterssulldaddy, Jun 03, 2012

4.59/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Consecration Batch 001x2. 750ml bottle poured into a Russian River tulip glass.
The pour is a nice dark, opaque, burgundy color, hints of brown and garnet when held to the light. There is a bit of tan colored head, very bubbly and light that comes to the top of the beer as it’s poured, but it dissipates very quickly leaving behind a few speckles of film and a nice off white ring around the glass with no additional lacing. The aroma is great, loads of currants jump out of the glass, moderate vinegar and acetic acid with a hint of funk, some vinous wine aromas with some nice sweet oak aromas from the barrel. The fruit is really dominant in the nose, which is great news considering the age of the beer and fruits tendency to fade out of the both the nose and the flavor profile of an older beer. The flavors are a bit harsher, still a strong amount of bitter, tart currants, dark plums and bing cherries are all noticeable fruit flavors. There is more vinegar than the nose suggests, the nice layer of grape-like wine flavors comes out as well but while this beer is certainly sour, it’s definitely more tart than an off putting, mouth puckering sour. The finish is a bit more astringent, sweet yet oak plays with the dirtier red wine-esque flavors, a bit of alcohol warms the throat as it goes down, and the bitter currants make a final appearance. The body is nice and carbonated, very prickly, which doesn’t help the astringent finish to the beer, but isn’t overly sharp and abrasive, still retains a nice level of smoothness.
Verdict: This is fantastic, this beer is aging gracefully although I would be weary of aging it too much further as the currant flavors could easily drop off leaving behind a bit of a vinegary mess. The fruit flavors are nice and tart and impressively potent which is all one can hope for in an aged beer. If you have the opportunity to try a vintage sour from Russian River, make no mistake, you will be well rewarded. 1,965 characterskevanb, May 24, 2012

But deep and complex. Cherry, plum, and toffee at the base with a nice spicy Brettanomyces note. Leather, shortbread, vanilla, and red wine vinegar as it warms. Great balance between fruit, sour, and malt. The price is steep, but the beer is nearly perfect. American craft beer at its finest. Oh, and the 10.5% ABV is silent. 446 charactersbump8628, May 23, 2012

A ~ Pours a very deep ruby red w/ crystal clarity & scraps of lace on the sides of the glass.

Aroma is rich fruity sour fruits, vinegary turned plums, caramelised prunes, wet earth, wet dark bread. It is excellent.
Taste is good but not as exciting as the aroma. It has tart-sour fruits and wood up front, light winy sweetness. It is very drinkable, has a good, lively feel. However, it is rather one-dimensional and not interesting, lacking in complexity or depth of character and thus gets somewhat boring rather quickly. 509 charactersOffa, May 11, 2012

A: Pours a deep red amber, is somewhat translucent. Not much in the way of visible carbonation.
S: Aroma is a bit like wine; fruity & dark. Sourness very evident in the nose.
T: Taste sweet and yet dry, with flavors of cherry, merlot, apple hints over the woody flavor. The fruity flavors are present, but it is not a sweet beer overall. I'm not sure of the words to use. Dry dry finish.
M: Nice mouthfeel - smooth, a little lighter mouthfeel than expected. It does result in some puckering sensation, to be sure. Alcohol presence less in the taste, more in the warming sensation down my esophagus.
O: Definitely a good sour beer, though not my favorite RR sour so far. I considered changing my description of the flavor - I'm assuming that I tasted Cabernet, not merlot. But I decided to leave my initial impression intact and expose my wine ignorance. 969 charactersmacrosmatic, May 05, 2012

A: Pours a fairly clear amber color. Basically no head. There was a good pop on the cork. But not a lot of carbonation. Lacing is non existent. You do catch some little alcohol feet.
S: I am getting the customary Flemish Red type smells off this one, but the complexity is amped with some of those vinous notes from the red wine barrel. I get some tart dark cherries and vinegar notes as well.
T: It's a more mild tart on the tip of the tongue. Then you get that tart dark cherry flavor that I have come to love. It's very smooth, and mellowed by the oak barrels I would assume. You do pull some of that leather and wood that red wine would add as well. You can't taste the 10% at all, as I thought that was a little high for the style. it's completely masked.
M: This is a lighter, medium mouthfeel for me. It's very drinkable and pleasant. 925 charactersinlimbo77, May 04, 2012

Appearance: Pours a translucent ruby/brown body with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Lacing and retention are at a minimum.
Smell: Tart characters from combination of the Cabernet Sauvignon and currant additions. Almost makes me glands water just smelling it.
Taste: Definitely a sour ale with the wine characteristics clearly amplifying the approach. Tobacco notes from the malt blend with a dark fruit to create a complex balance of sour subtlety. No bite whatsoever from the alcohol!!
Mouthfeel: Carbonation like a champagne or sparkling wine finishing clean but not too dry.

Decent clarity through a murky coppery-orange color. Looks brown without a light backdrop. Little head after raising the bottle during the pour. An eggshell ring holds thick. 3.5
So much pucker in the nose. Faint sweetness matching tart berries (currants). Alcohol, barnyard funk, hay, lemon, unripe raspberry, barrel wood, and a tannic red wine. Nice aroma/fumes. 4.5
Not super sour, as I might have expected. Rounded vinous barrel, heaps of critter funk, tart currants, lemon juice, wild flora tang, and thin malts. Some aged hop hopping that bitters the beer a bit in the finish. Slightly acetic. Maybe even lactic. Has a great big cabernet vibe. Very much like a soured red wine, full of tannins and oak characteristics. Hints of blackberry, tobacco, and bitter almond. Fabulous. 4.5
Younger bottle shows some nice spritz, especially in the finish. Medium-thin body is a bit surprising for a 10% beer. So is the near-absence of strength in the taste. A tame but welcoming mouthfeel, overall. 4.0
This is a top-notch sour. I've heard these (and other) RR sours can go downhill after some aging, but I'm excited to check in on my batch #006 in a year or two. A must try. 4.5 1,268 charactersthecheapies, Apr 30, 2012

Aroma is packed with prominent oak, mustiness, funk, sweet currants and sour cherries, slight vinegar underneath. Taste has all this and more; it’s fruity, sour, a bit tart and oaky. Not an over-the-top sour warhead-type beer, just well integrated sourness with the oak and a touch of vinegar. The currants are fairly subtle, with more tart cherry flavor than anything else. Definite must and funk; vinous, slightly sweet, very complex.
Medium bodied with low carbonation; I would have preferred a crisper, livelier, and cleaner feel, although the finish is quite dry. Interesting beer to be sure, curious about the stillness of this particularly bottle. Very good, but not as appealing as Supplication, Sanctification, or Temptation for my money. 930 characterstobelerone, Apr 24, 2012

A clear light ruby red when held to the light with just a thin film foe head that falls quickly and leaves zero lace, I like the color 
S funky strawberry and cassis with some oaked vinous notes with some vinegar, smells pretty good and I'd never guess it's 10% 
T I prefer the taste with more sour vinegar and the cassis is easier to pick up, more vinous notes leaves me wondering if there was still wine in the barrel, I pick up on the subtle barrel notes but its the liquid grape that I can taste 
M sour and leaves my mouth tingling just a little, still no heat and a slickness left behind, pin prick bubbles work well 
O perhaps I was a little hard on the smell, it may have been closer to great then good, I'm more impressed by how they made a 10% BA brew that has no booze anywhere

Appearance - Pours with a hint of a brown head that's gone in a flash. Nothing after that. Looks flat as hell. The body is a dark ruby red. Looks like a glass of cabernet.
Smell - Acidic and lactic sour aromas. Oak. Strong red wine presence. Distinctly cabernet, too. I'm amazed how well the wine comes through. Sour fruits round out the flavor. Cherries and I suppose currants, but hell if I've ever actually smelled currants.
Taste - Like the flavor, but with a more pronounced acidity. Sour at first. Not puckering, but it's sustained throughout the drink. Lots of sour fruits followed by a ton of cabernet. The finish of the beer is dry, but the wine character overwhelms the dryness leaving it with a vinous character in the end.
Mouthfeel - It's not a light sour by any means. In fact it gets kinda tough to drink after a while. Medium-low carbonation doesn't help. It feels like I'm drinking a sour glass of wine more than a beer.
Overall - Interesting flavors, but a huge sour ale that gets sluggish and repetitive as I drink it. Tasty, but not something I could drink all the time. 1,151 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 09, 2012

The beer, poured into a tulip glass, gave a reddish brown hue with a modest head. The head rapidly disappears, giving a better look at the beer. The initial taste immediately caused me to think of a tart lemon candy. Though as the flavor develops, one can sense sour red fruit flavors that are rounded by oak chips. There are a certain vinegar notes, typical of a sour present. The spiciness leads well into the aftertaste which ends the experience on a dry note. The modest level of carbonation allows the flavors to linger and develop. Of course, this is improtant because Consecration is a complex beer. 690 charactersJohnnyHopps, Apr 07, 2012

S: Divine. Really get sour oak upfront and a bit of dark fruitiness. Lots of earthy funkiness to it. Also get the smell of rotten cherries sort of at the end, sounds weird, but it's actually quite pleasant
T: Think of every red fruit you've ever had( cranberries, cherries, etc) now add vinegar and dip it in oak chips. That's pretty much how this tastes. Possibly the most balanced flavor from any RR sour ale. I really picked up the funk in the taste more than the smell also.
M: For a beer that looks nearly flat it has quite a carbonation bite and that couples really well with the tartness. Very dry finish
Overall this is a splendid ale from RR. It's probably my favorite wild ale that I've had from them (this or Beatification, totally different though) I usually try to keep these in stock because of how available they are, just finally got around to reviewing it. Great fresh or aged too, the bottle I had was one of the newer batches though, 007 1,110 charactersBobheed, Apr 07, 2012

I mean, as much as I want to get it, I just don't. Have you ever picked up a sack of apples that have fallen off the tree? The sack was left outside all night. You went out the next late afternoon and picked them up. The movement stirred the honey bees inside. You stuck your head in the sack. This beer tastes like that apple sack smells. I do enjoy how after the beer disappears from the palate and I lick my lips, there's a sweet taste that, subsequently, appears on the tongue. I'm still developing my palate for the wilds.

A: Pours a ruddy brown color. There is some light tan foam as I pour but it disappears quickly.
S: The smell is lightly fruity and sweet. There is a little bit of tangy vinegar as well. Some citrus/apple.
T: Very tart. The currants are luscious and tangy. A slight vinegar flavor complements this nicely. There is a mild vinous and sour grape character that increases as the beer warms. A good amount of barnyard funk, wet hay, but its much more tart than funky. There is also a lactic sourness that permeates the flavor and leaves my mouth watering. I can taste a lot of different tangy fruit flavors like apple, citrus and grapefruit. Cannot taste the alcohol at all.
M: Small amount of carbonation is effervescent and playful. Light bodied and mouthwatering.
O: A very good sour beer. There are a lot of dimensions to this beer; it covers sour, tart, funky, vinegar and tangy. The fruit flavor is also vibrant. 973 charactersWankelEngine, Mar 29, 2012

Poured into a Southern Tier tulip. Pours a dark ruby, amber color with a thin layer of fizzy, white head that quickly fizzles away. The nose has notes of grapes, alcohol, and currants. The smell is quite spicy and fruity with a significant amount of the alcohol coming through. The flavor is very tart and sour. It makes my cheeks pucker immediately. The currants come through as do some fruits like red grapes and maybe raspberries. There is a juice or wine characteristic to it. The alcohol really isn't too noticeable. It adds some warmth as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, a bit viscous, smooth, and has a bubbly carbonation.
This is my first Wild Ale. I'm impressed. It's complex, drinkable, smooth, refreshing, but a sipper. If RR was available around NC I would have this more often for sure. 877 characterstdm168, Mar 22, 2012

I've had every single batch of this beer, multiple times. I am reviewing the latest batch (#5) here, but I will include a summary of all at the end. 
A: Pours a clear maroon body with generous light beige head. It fills the glass and leaves some sticky rings of lace down the sides. 
S: A good balance of cabernet barrels and currants. The bugs have done their work: funk is represented in a combination of leather and hay; the sourness is primarily lactic, though there is an afterthough of acetic acid. My main request here would be to bump up the brettanomyces presence. The sourness could (and probably will) develop with time, but the funk hasn't hit my desired level. 
T: Cabernet grapes, a darker currant presence, and tannins. There's a mild undercurrent of earth and leather. It's also quite sour, with a dominant lactic presence and a touch of vinegar in the finish. This isn't as aggressively sour as batch 4; it has found a better balance. I can't say it's perfect, but to my palate, it is upper-tier. 
M: A bit boozy, but that's accentuated by the vinegary finish (and it becomes especially prominent toward the end of the bottle). Unlike the last batch, this one doesn't produce a constant, undrinkable burn. 
O: Batch 5 is an improvement over batch 4. I still think this beer is oscillating, and it peaked with batch 3, but this is a strong showing. I wish the bottles didn't have that slight price increase when they shrank sizes, but oh well. I've had a couple of bottles of this iteration, but I'll probably wait to see if the next one (or, judging by the pattern, batch 7) improves upon it. 
Batch #1: by far the most vinegary. This was great in my early days; Consecration was my first sour and it was an immediate love affair. My tastes have changed since then; I don't think I'd like an acetic interpretation anymore. (4.9)
Batch #2: less sour than batch 1. The emphasis was on wine barrel, with a tannic and earthy flavor dominating. I was less enthused about this batch. (4.6)
Batch #3: this tastes like it was made for my palate. Lactic sourness with just a touch of acetic burn in the finish. Good balance of wine barrel to the fruit. Just lovely. (5.0)
Batch #4: really lactic, with initially a mild acetic burn, but it gets pronounced and overpowering by the end of a 375mL. Difficult to finish for one person. Wine-barrel heavy, with tannic, leathery, and earthy flavors coming out. Reminds me of a more sour batch #2. (3.6)
Batch #5: this is on the return path to greatness, though not quite there. Mild lactic sourness, a presence of acetic burn in the finish. Good, but not overpowering, incorporation of wine barrels. Currants are distinct. (3.9)
Batch #6: I lost my notes from when I had this. 
Batch #7: This tastes like he's starting to dial in the recipe; it is similar to batch 5, but with less acetic burn. It has a dominant lactic sourness (though it is not palate-destroying or stomach-churning) with a huge buildup of tannic currant and grape skin in the finish. The barrel is really prominent here; the cabernet sauvignon is unmistakable, making the beer taste like a slightly soured wine. Good, not great. (3.63) 3,199 charactersArbitrator, Mar 15, 2012

S- Funky prune or fig juice is the standout aroma here. Pomegranate and some oak. 
T- I love the flavor profile here. Starting off with some of that rich fruit figs, cranberries, prune before leading into that tart raspberry and even some strawberry. Then it's the pomegranate smoothness and some real oak dry finish. Immaculate.
M- So nice. Puckering, with the juice there in the middle and the dry finish.
O- Russian River is out of hand. Love it. 644 charactersNachojon, Mar 13, 2012

The smell is dominated by the sour tartness of the bacteria with just a hint of vinous wine and blackberry.
The flavor is nicely sour with dark blackberry and grape flavors coming through along with a heavy oaky and cedar barrel flavor. Has a bit of leathery and tobacco flavor coming through as well.
The mouthfeel is dry and a bit puckering.
Nicely done American Sour, the Cab barrel and Blackberry add a little something extra that is nice. 535 charactersbashiba, Mar 09, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 375 mL. corked and caged bottle (Batch 007) into a tulip glass.
A strong pour yields a 1 1/2-finger tan-colored head that quickly fizzes away to just a thin foam ring in seconds. The body is a translucent dark ruby brown with decent amount of carbonation bubbles. Some light lacing can be seen clinging temporarily to the sides of the glass between sips but does not seem to stick around long.
Sweet, dark fruit aromas comprise the majority of the nose with notes of dark, wild berries (blackberries, mulberries, etc.) Oak, black cherries, and barnyard funk add a good bit of complexity and sourness.
Like the nose, each sip starts sweet and dark with flavors of berries. Swirling the liquid in the mouth allows a surprisingly strong sourness to impact the sides of the tongue. Swallowing the beer releases more sourness, oak and wild berry flavor, and straight-up funk. Flavors of unsweetened blueberries, currants, and pomegranate come out at this stage. As these flavors fade, a true cabernet sauvignon wine flavor sets in leading to a pleasing dryness. Surprisingly, outside of the cab flavor, no alcohol is detected.
The medium body is refreshing and easy to swallow but just a tad sticky. The carbonation is worse than a bowl of Rice Krispies with milk being added. As the beer warms, the carbonation seems to die down, really letting all the flavors come to fruition. 1,392 charactersoutput01x, Mar 08, 2012

Big thanks to jzeilinger for this one.
Poured from a 375ml. bottle.
Appearance: Pours a lop sided 2-3 finger head (burnt sugar color) that quickly fizzes away with almost no lacing. A murky copper-light brown body with some red hints.
Smell: Sour berries, bit of sweetness and tartness not powerful. Some blackberries and wood.
Taste: Currants & blackberry seeds, really powerful with some tartness. Cabernet brings out the cork and red wine and melds seamlessly with the rest. Fine, tangy and complex.
Mouthfeel: Fairly dry and it fills every corner of the mouth. Tart but retains a level of comfort.
Overall: Really, really dug this. I could literally picture the currants i was tasting in the beer. ABV has zero impediment and this awesome blend is excellent. 787 characterspapat444, Mar 05, 2012

Deep red, small head.

From notes taken on 1/6/2012
I was really excited to find this on tap
A: Dark amber red with 1 fingers width of snow white colored head which quickly dissipates down to and outter rim and leaves no lacing. 
S: Strong red wine and sour grapes, sour apple and brett aromas with a hint of sour pear. Also a unique whisky like aroma. 
T: Complex flavor profile, there is certainly a lot going on. Sour apple and sour grapes, plus some other grape flavors of the non sour variety. The brett is certainly noticed, and there is a touch of a whiskey like oak flavor. Towards the end of the drink the cab sauv flavors start to come out, although still not as strong as I anticipated. There is a great lingering aftertaste after every sip. The prominent flavors are certainly sour fruits and wine, although neither to the degree that I expected. Very good. 
M/D:Bubbly, champagne-like mouthfeel, and each sip finishes dry like a good red wine. Heavy carbonation, medium bodied, good drinkability. I never would have guessed it is in double digit ABVs/ Perfect mouthfeel. 
O: Overall, an excellent beer. Very unique, and a must try for fans of sours, wild ales, and unique beers in general. 1,247 characterszac16125, Feb 16, 2012

A: Absolutely no head when poured from the bottle. You can see a very small amount of bubbles collected at the bottom of the glass, but other then that, no carbonation really looking at it. The color is a deep mahogany red. 
S: I don't get as much of the currants as some have described. I'm getting more of a balsamic sour funk with deep fruit notes. As it warms you also definitely get the wine barrels it was aged in. Very dry funk to the nose. 
T: For 10% this beer is definitely very drinkable. However the taste doesn't quite wow me. I had a Supplication earlier in the year and despite this beer's amazing description, I found Supplication to be more complex in the flavor. But that's just me. The taste is a really nice tart sour up front, but it finishes with a fruity sweet character. Figs, cherries, and some musty wine notes are all present.
M: Very lightly carbonated and tart on the back of the palate. 
O: Overall I enjoyed this beer, but it didn't wow me the way I thought it would. Still, for an American Wild Red Sour Ale I found it to be quite pleasant. I will have to branch out and try the other wild ales Russian River makes because both Supplication and Consecration were very unique and interesting beers. 1,268 charactersBeerandLoathing, Feb 15, 2012

4.05/5  rDev -8.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Small bottle shared with a few BA's.
This brew pours very still. Zero head, a few bubbles, no lace. 
The nose is a deep current scent that is sweet prominent. There is also an amount of toffee-like notes that add to the sweetness. 
The taste surprises me because there is a nice tartness that went unnoticed when smelling this brew. The sweetness offered by the currents is soon matched with an abundant amount of semi-sweet tartness. I am enjoying the balance here for sure.
The mouthfeel is pretty awkward for the style because the way this beer sits in the glass. It is so calm without any sings of carbonation but once the sip is taken, boom!, a lip smacking tartness is soon experienced . 
Overall, this is a very unusual, wine-like brew that takes on some unfamiliarity in the visual department but makes up for it when tasted. I was uneasy but now satisfied. 870 charactersChugginOil, Feb 14, 2012

Smell- little bit of funk and tartness on the nose, currants, can really almost smell the tartness
Taste- you get a little bit of the wine and oak, also a little bit of the currant, but the predominant flavor is just strong sharp sourness, you really don't taste the alcohol at all but the funk and sour is strong, 
Mouthfeel- very light and crisp, sour and tart feel, just very light and crisp
Overall/drinkability- while this beer was better then many of the other sours I have tried it still just is not my thing, i just simply don't get it, i can appreciate the complexity and strong flavors of this beer but to me these are just super hard to drink, i mean when i say this beer is sour its super super sour like lemonhead sour, certainly a unique experience but for me just not enjoyable really beyond the novelty 949 charactersStunner97, Feb 09, 2012

Batch 007
Thanks to futura123 for hooking me up with this one. 
I had Temptation last night and while it was a very tasty sour with a lovely white wine character, it lacked both the power and depth of a true lambic. I hope that the uniqueness of Consecration (strength and ingredients) will give it a boost in these departments. 
Appearance: Deep mahogany brown body that shows stunning red and orange highlights when back lit. A rough pour yields a small off white head that sadly fizzes away pretty quickly leaving no lacing. 
Smell: The nose is initially quite restrained; however it begins to emerge after a short while and actually smells pretty damn good! Red wine, dark fruits (plums, cherries, figs and currants) and balsamic vinegar dominate the nose, with lighter notes of oak, a metallic quality (reminiscent of a Flemish red), barnyard and old cheese (old rather than nicely ripe) also present. 
Taste: Unfortunately the flavour does not quite deliver the deliciousness that the nose promised – it almost seems as though part of the flavour is obscured by the moderate tartness.
 Dark fruits (plums, figs, cherries and currants) dominate the flavour, with the red wine character slightly less prominent than in the nose. Balsamic, light spices, oak, an earthy character and a hint of barnyard are also noted. The tartness is moderate and makes Consecration sublimely drinkable for a 10% ale. 
Mouthfeel: Unexpectedly at this Abv. Consecration is a medium (or just under) bodied ale with a high level of ultra smooth carbonation (Russian River seem to nail the carbonation in their sours!). The tartness is moderate and the finish is lightly dry. 
Overall: Sadly consecration suffers from the same woes as Temptation - it just doesn't seem to have the depth of flavour that Belgian sours do. On the plus side, this is certainly the most drinkable 10% beer I have had! I will consider getting another bottle of consecration in the future - maybe a year or two of age will bump up the flavours. 2,090 charactersThehuntmaster, Feb 08, 2012

Pours a dark ruby bordering on maroon. What little head there was dissipates right away. Not super inviting but I'm not at all familiar with sours.
Smell is very pleasing if you like wine. Smells much smoother than a mediocre bottle of cab (I'm talking cheap mediocre...not sommelier mediocre). I get a lot of oak and spicy notes. Dark fruit and funkiness. 
Sourness is present right away and lingers well into the finish. In between there's bright and tart cherry. As it warms there are very nice oak notes that come out. Some tobacco.
Mouthfeel...The RR website tells me its full bodied but I would call it medium. The sourness may be throwing off my perception but that's how it seems to me.
Overall...Not my cup of tea. The beer might've been too young, and I don't know anything about aging sours or the style in general. It's not too harsh or intense. Just not pleasant to me. Gonna stick to PtE for now, but I'm glad I tried it. Any insight to sours is welcome through beermail. 1,000 charactersnatemort13, Feb 04, 2012

A: deep clear amber w/dark ruby highlights. Similar to the color of an old madeira. Little to no head dissipates immediately and cannot be roused back by swirling. No lacing. Served in tulip glass.
S: dark stone fruit and red wine dominate. Some funkiness and earthiness but those characteristics are not overpowering.
T: very little residual sweetness present. Mostly dry and sour. Nose carries over into the taste. Very mich like drinking a lightly carbonated tannic red wine, although the sourness is more vinegary than tannic. Some oak/vanilla noted which is a nice layer of complexity here.
M: this must be the lightest bodied 10% beer I've ever had by a mile, due to the high attenuation. Sourness lingers. more CO2 would've helped, as there is very little.
O/D: for the style, I am sure this is a great achievement. But I can't see having very much of this and would need to be in the mood for it. This probably would be a great pairing for some food/dishes, and as a component of such as well, although the cost would be prohibitive in the latter case.
I'm certain some lovers of this beer and/or sours will report this review (much like my review of thomas hardy's old ale). To these people i can only say i tried to be open-minded and enjoy having my own opinion, and that i prefer beer to wine. 1,407 charactersMrMcGibblets, Jan 29, 2012

Consecration is classified as an American Wild Ale, and the label gives hints of what awaits the lucky drinker. Words like Saccharomyces, Pediococcus, Brettanomyces, and Lactobacillus hover around the words Sour Ale, and the excitement begins to build. Add all that to the fact the beer is aged in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels and you realize you have something pretty special in your glass. Consecration pours a reddish-brown, yet near the edges appears very plum like, with a quickly disappearing head that fizzes almost like soda. Hugely vinous aromas greet the drinker, including notes of vanilla, oak, Cabernet Sauvignon, and earthy hop tones/funk. The pallet erupts in an orgy of flavors, with the initial sourness giving way to darker fruit, citrus, Cabernet notes as well as earthiness (horse blanket) from the Brettanomyces. The fizziness noticed in the pour sticks around for the entire brew, a sign of a huge amount of carbonation that is met with a medium body. 985 charactersphishsihq, Jan 26, 2012
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. This bottle is from batch 004X1
Appearance: As poured the beer is deep mahogany color with a thin head that quickly recedes to small ring around the glass and some whispy islands of thin foam floating on the surface. Initially there is some lacing but it soon slides back into the liquid. Sipping leaves a bit of an arch of lacing patches and legs.
Smell: The aroma conveys the impression of tartness. It has a fruity character from the currants and I’d swear I’m picking up some of the Cabernet as well. The oak seems to be in here as well with both a touch of the wood and traces of vanilla.
Taste: The flavors are a lovely mix of tart and sweet all at once. The currants are here, there is some oak and vanilla in the mix, and the cabernet wine has a subtle but pervasive influence that supports but does not intrude on the rest. The alcohol is well concealed in this one, so at this ABV it’s a good idea to sip slowly so the effects don’t sneak up and 
Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied and the effect of the carbonation is really only a faint prickly feeling. The finish is long, fruity and tart with a dry oaky ending that leaves the back of the mouth feeling dry empty.
Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is definitely a sipping beer, both because of the ABV and because one wants to keep those small sips coming along to refresh the palate and give it a chance to sort out the complexity. This is not a subtle beer, rather it grabs your taste buds and wrestles with them, challenging them to pick up and identify all the flavors. My overall impression of this beer is that it is yet another winner from Russian River and I’m glad there are so many Cabernet barrels in CA so that we can expect to see this one again and again. 1,849 charactersdrtth, Jan 26, 2012

The nose leads with lactic acid, wine, and funk and is balanced by the smell of currants. When you take a sip the beer explodes with a lactic sourness rounded by the oak and a slight astringency from the tannins.

S - Acidic notes of vinegar and tart cherry. Oak, vanilla, some cabernet infuences as well. The sweetness from the fruits and the barrels mix well with the sourness.
T - Tart and tangy brett flavours dominate the palate up front but. The full spectrum of flavours shows up in the middle, with currants, sour cherry and oak all combining to create a complex flavour profile. The funky/sour flavours return in the finish and linger a little bit in the after taste.
M- Light bodied, lively carbonation. Mouth watering with a quick dry finish. Slight aftertaste.

A- Pours a clear dark reddish color. About a finger's worth of white head forms but quickly disappears. Foam lingers along the rim of the glass. It appears very carbonated and bubbly, there is a bubble volcano type thing going on in the top center of the glass.
S- Smells like wine basically, with the smell of alcohol. I smell hints of grapes and berries too. 
T- Tastes of unripened grapes and cherries. The sour taste comes toward the end, which is very refreshing and not overpowering. 
M- Light and carbonated, nice aftertaste. Very easy drinking. 
This is a style I'm just getting into. This is a great example of an American wild/ sour. The way I can describe it is it's like drinking a glass half full of wine and half beer. A very interesting beer. 819 charactersvic21234, Jan 23, 2012
4.05/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle courtesy of HimerMan. From the second bottling ever, LA website says 12/26/08. Let's see how it has matured.
Pours a dark red/amber color with an shade darker that totally white head. Pretty good soapy lacing. 
Aromas begin with a good/deep sourness that is not at all overpowering; more of an inviting scent. Behind that, sweet and tart fruits. Not sure what a currant smells like but I am not getting much of an actual fruitiness beyond the sour aromas, but that is to be expected from a 3+ year old sour ale.
Flavors begin with an excellent level of sourness. A lot of complexity in the flavor. Lots of tartness paired with some citrus and sweet fruits. Some darker maltiness as it starts to warm, but the long drawn out sour flavor comes back and dries out the palate and really pushes the flavor to the next level. While I love the flavor it is still fairly one dimensional at this stage of it's lifespan.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with the perfect amount of sourness. Good carbonation but not overwhelming which can happen with certain sours overtime. Drink WAY WAY lighter than 10%, drinks like 6% max; this stuff is straight dangerous. 
Overall this was a nice treat for me. I really loved the flavor profile despite it being fairly one noted. I would have liked to sample it fresher to see if I could have tasted more currants or some actual fruits beyond the sourness. Drinkability is off the charts expecially for how high the ABV is on this beast. A really solid sour and worth seeking out for fans of the style. Nothing mind-blowing, just super solid. 1,581 charactersclaspada, Jan 22, 2012

body is a cloudy reddish orange. Head was soda pop fizzy. Like a dark gueuze.
Acidic sourness initially. All the lovely Brett smells come into play nicely. Light red wine (maybe thats the Cabernet barrels) is hidden underneath all of it.
Nice gueuze-like sourness, but its balanced by a wine like smoothness. What separates Consecration from other gueuzes is the sweetness. Its light, and sits light. The initial gueuze sourness hits you in the mouth, then fades with a wave subtle sweetness that leaves your mouth coated with that sweetness. As I work my way through the beer, it has wine-like qualities that make it even better. The booze is felt with a tingle on the tongue. a 10% Wild?!
Its not as sour as Belgians, but the overall balance is very refreshing.

A: Pours a murky redish brown. There are more red hues than brown. After a vigorous pour, there is absolutely no head. There is a tiny white ring along the edges of the glass, but it's pretty much non-existent. No lacing as it drinks.
S: I'm picking up scents of tart cherries, plums, prunes, and vinegar. The tartness takes over and holds on. It's hard to pick out scents other than the ones mentioned already.
T: The taste starts out fruity and extremely tart. There is no doubt that it's all sour cherry and vinegar. That may sound a bit disgusting, but it's delicious. And to be honest... I'm not even a huge fan of cherries. This beer is fantastic.
M: Medium bodied beer. The feel is tart and astringent. The flavors coat the palate, but shift quickly into fleeting sour.

Seriously, this beer is the f'n best thing ever. The pour comes out the same shade of brown as the bottle's label. It reminds me of root beer in its appearance and slight carbonation bubbles steadily rising. There isn't a whole lot of brett funk in the aroma, but more of a wine aroma. A friend said 'paint stripper'. I said that's the smell of 'awesome'. I can't write a review that would adequately describe the taste of this brew, or do it any justice. It's tart, sour, but not overly so. Your mouth waters after each drink, begging for one more taste. It has the perfect balance, allowing you to drink this endlessly. Despite being a heavy-hitter at 10% ABV, you do not taste it at all. The warmth from it comes through, but that is it. Consecration finishes with an dryness that finishes its statement of 'Yes, you are drinking the most epic shit ever'. 1,104 charactersstealth, Jan 12, 2012

Aroma of oak and tart notes with some blackcurrant notes – very complex. Taste is also a very complex mix between some blackcurrant, some tart notes and some pedio with light sweet figs at the end. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation and no signs of alcohol even though it does pack quite a punch. Very well done. 436 charactersPhyl21ca, Jan 11, 2012

S: Fruity aroma reminiscent of cherry and raisins with a hint of sourness and phenol, very nice. 
T: Sour –tart flavor, pretty smooth and not too strong, some phenol and wood-wine notes (this is barrel aged after all), fruit notes in the aroma carries through very nicely in the flavor. Some alcohol warmth at finish, but much more tart than boozy. 
M: Soft mouth feel, fairly high carbonation gives it a bubbly feel.
O: This is a pretty complex sour ale, but it might be better to call it a "tart" ale. The sourness is better described that way. Highly recommended to try. Really like the balance, it provides a refreshing flavor on the tongue. If you like fruit-tart-wood-wine notes in a beer, you should love this. 766 charactersicepik, Jan 08, 2012

Pours brown, no head from the slow pour. Bubbles like rootbeer or champagne.
Smells like red wine, not so much on the funk, but it's there, has some fruitiness.
Taste is of tart wine from start to finish, plenty of grape from the barrel. Finished like wine in the aftertaste.
Feels very light and champagny. Bubbly on the tongue.
Overall, I still don't know if I would call this beer. Definitely more focused than the Supplication, but not as complex. While I really liked this concoction, I won't be seeking either out. Then again, I wouldn't turn it down either.

A: The beer is a bright reddish brown color, with a very thin off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a very thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains wild Belgian yeast, esters, dark fruit and some light malts.
T: The taste starts out with a tart dark berry flavor followed by the wild Belgian yeast to enhance the sourness. The malt character is thin and the hops presence is very mild but both are where they should be for the style and create a good balance. The after-taste is slightly sour.
M: Crisp and a little smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, well disguised kick, good representation of style, this is a good sour beer to drink for a long time. 899 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jan 04, 2012

4.09/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375mL bottle of Russian River Consecration - batch number 7.
Appearance: Consecration pours a burnt maroon color with a thin, whispy white head and a relatively translucent body despite the bottle conditioning.
Smell: the Cabernet Sauvignon barrels really come through in the nose; theres a strong, unmistakable smell of red wine. I was expecting the brettanomyces to be a little more pronounced, but it wasn't really contributing much to the aroma on this one.
Taste: undeniably tart, yet not mouth puckering. The bacteria (lactobacillus and pediococcus) impart this souring flavor, yet seem to play well with the addition of currants as well as the lingering Cabernet Sauvignon components. The high ABV imparts a nice warming sensation, but isn't really perceptible otherwise.
Mouthfeel: Consecration is medium bodied and finishes with a wine-like dryness.
Overall: an interesting beer to be sure, and the only barrel aged offering from Russian River I've ever had (Supplication and Temptation are in the fridge). It was certainly enjoyable, but I wasn't really blown away.. And I'm not sure if I'd be willing to buy it online again and eat the cost of shipping. Now if I lived in California it would probably be a different story. 1,238 charactersBlastBeats, Jan 01, 2012

Appearance : medium dark brown in color. Effervescent carbonation produces a fizzy champagne like head that dissipates quite quickly 
Smell : this aroma is hard to describe other than funky goodness. 
Taste : great flavor lots of tart fruit and grapes. Sour cherries also provide a nice pucker.The alcohol is not assertive which is surprising given its 10% abv
Mouthfeel : full bodied sour this beer really packs a punch. Champagne like bubbles dance on the tongue.
Overall : overwhelming well done brew. Strangely addictive the more RR sours I have the more I want. The best way to describe this beer is that it is somehow a hybrid of beer/wine/ champagne 707 charactersBUNZILLA, Jan 01, 2012

A - Pours a beautiful ruby red/brown with one finger of quickly dissipating off-white head. No lacing.
S - Nice presence of Cabernet Sauvignon, good amount of earthy funk, and of course quite a sour presence, nice a dry fruitiness and a bit of oak.
T - Nice bright tartness to start this off, with earthy brett notes. Fruit is more assertive in the middle, with currents and tart cherry flavors coming through. Dry oak tannins and finish tartness on the finish.
M - Light, crisp mouthfeel with an earthy dry finish an some lingering tartness.
O - Excellent wild ale. I prefer the flavor profile of Supplication, but I have no complaints about this whatsoever and will have it whenever I can. 722 characterswarnerry, Dec 30, 2011

4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 6, 375ml into a Russian River tulip.
Pours murky burgundy with bubbles that dissipate into nothing almost instantly. Bubbles can be seen dancing to the top and collecting on the sides.
Plums, raisins, sour cherries, and currants greet your nose. A real vinous fruit quality, with a touch of tannin. Notes of red wine and balsamic vinegar creep in as the beer warms up and a little tingle of alcohol. 
Opens with a touch of berry like sweetness that very quickly moves into a biting, vinegary like sour. Pitted and dark fruits still present on the tongue but much less than on the nose. Finishes with a nice fruity pucker, and a touch of alcohol.
Medium bodied with a touch of carbonation. A bit of drying, pucker, and a hint of alcohol.
Awesome fruity vinous flavors with a pucker and an alcoholic punch. Amazing how consistent Russian River can make an availably, high quality sour ale like this one. They never disappoint. 935 charactersauroracrisis, Dec 30, 2011

The color is a brownish-red color. Almost coppery. 
It smells very strongly of the wine barrels (Cabernet in this case) with notes of grape and cherry. Maybe a hint of oak. Obviously it has a sour smell, but in an awesome way. 
The taste is immediately sour cherries and wine grapes. Very tart and the Cabernet comes through a lot. Not being a wine drinker at all this seems like it would be a turn off but the tartness and sour cherry flavor really hits my tastebuds the right way. 
The carbonation provides a bite that really compliments the tartness of the beer.
Overall I think this is a very good beer. Its not, in my opinion, on par with Supplication (which I had just a few days ago) but it is definitely a great example of sour ales and something I would pick up again given the opportunity despite the price tag of $13 for 375ml. 889 charactersDonDirkA, Dec 29, 2011

This is my first review as a member so pardon my inexperience in describing the beer. This is not one to pound down- definitely a sipper. The Cabernet comes through strong in the nose and in the taste. Has great carbonation. Sour cherry flavor and cabernet flavors followed by earthy malt taste. I'm usually not a fan of sour ales but this one is certainly one to try- after a few sips I was hooked. Very pricey but if you want something out of the ordinary go for it. 550 charactersHopdaemon39, Dec 28, 2011

A: Slightly hazy dark copper / ruby red color. Fizzy light tan head, rose about 2-3 fingers and receded to a mm or so of froth. Not much lacing. 
S: Oak, yeast, vinegar, leather, tobacco, sour apples, cherries. Smells very tart, almost made my eyes water when I popped the cork. Definite dark fruit Cabernet aroma when you get a full whiff.
T: Mildly tart, cherries, vinegar, oak, vanilla, leather, sour yeast. The finish is very savory, dry and vinous, not quite as crisp and mouthwatering as many sours tend to be. Wow, really impressed with this.
M/O: Medium bodied, high carbonation, and just.... freaking delicious. This is the best example of a wild ale I have had. 723 charactersReelBigwigFish, Dec 20, 2011

Those aroma characteristics were consistent with the flavor of the brew, some mild tartiness and yeasy flavors - a medium to heavy body, creamy texture and light carbonation ... very interesting. Not one I would continue to pursue due to personal tastes - but a very interesting beer to sample!! 523 charactersbrendaniel, Dec 11, 2011

A - Pours a dark brown color with no real light shining through. A very small cream colored head forms and recedes to a small, bubbly collar.
S - Acidic notes of vinegar and tart cherry. Oak, vanilla, some cabernet infuences as well. The sweetness from the fruits and the barrels mix well with the sourness.
T - Sweetness and sourness mix quite well here. Flavors of grape, cherry, oak tannins, and Brett funk. There's a tartness from the fruits that adds nicely to the lactic acidity going on. Really nice flavors. 
M - Medium bodied beer with ample carbonation. Smooth and crisp with a slight dryness on the finish.
O - I enjoyed this one, although it was not as good to me as Supplication and Temptation. Really great American Wild from Vinnie. 837 charactersKAP1356, Dec 06, 2011

A 375ml bottle caged and corked, poured into a tulip glass. A good frothy head attempted to form but quickly dissipated to a ring of bubbles.
The nose on this one is very interesting, sweet like bubble gum, phenolic, sour and tart cherry.
Taste is great, a nice balance of tart dark fruit with a dry finish. Not much sweetness in the taste as the nose would leave one to believe.
Pretty good overall. The bottle lacks carbonation but I am not complianing, that's a reality with bottle conditioned beers. The alcohol is very well hidden in this one. 597 charactersalpineclimber, Dec 05, 2011

A - Medium to dark brown with almost no light passing through aside from a slight glow around the edges. A small amount of cream coloured head formed and quickly receded to almost nothing. 
S - A subtle hit of grapes intermingled with the expected funky/sour yeast notes. The sourness, although definitely a big part of the nose, doesn't dominate like it does in most American Wild Ales. A complex complimentary array or armoma, includes sour cherry, vinegar and oak.
T - Tart and tangy brett flavours dominate the palate up front but. The full spectrum of flavours shows up in the middle, with currants, sour cherry and oak all combining to create a complex flavour profile. The funky/sour flavours return in the finish and linger a little bit in the after taste.
M - Light body with light to moderate carbonation. 
O - This is a style that I am still developing a taste for and this is the first one that I have truly enjoyed. I am very happy tha I took a chance on this one. 1,021 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Dec 01, 2011

Batch 006 into my Lost Abbey tulip.
A- Clear grape juice colored pour. Half finger fizzy off white head quickly disappears into obscurity leaving little wisps on top. Lacing is zero.
S- These oak barrels add a sweetness that help compliment the funkyness you find in a wild ale. Currents, grape juice, red wine, vanilla and sour apple with a touch of lemon.
T- Typical lemon, grape skin and cranberry tartness. It isn't over the top sour but still makes your mouth water. Currents are evident but more subdued than the nose. There is a dryness that I would attribute to the oak and the brett. The funk meter is sitting around 7 out of 10.
M- Light bodied, lively carbonation. Mouth watering with a quick dry finish. Slight aftertaste.
O- Another check mark beside the RR "ion" beers and I have yet to be disappointed. This isn't my favorite so far but that does not make it anything short of spectacular. 955 characterskorguy123, Dec 01, 2011

A: Pours a very dark brown with a decidedly blood red tinge. A nice quarter finger crisp white head provides a startling and pleasing contrast with crimson tones below. Decent lacing and fantastic head retention. I really like what I'm seeing here.
S: Mmmm, funk, some ripe, dark fruit, tart cherry, and fermented grapes. The oak aging is apparent here, but instead of overwhelming the nose, it provides a nice backbone for all the other notes. Tart and funky.
T: Funk and oak wood chips. Sweet dark fruit and some tart cherry notes. A very dry finish with a bit of alcohol burn, but I'm digging it. Not as tart a wild ale as some, but definitely gives you a bit of a pucker. The oak char keeps everything in check. Almost wine-like. Very good.
M: Oak might be just a bit too prominent here. Covers up the tart fruit and funk on the finish. But it's a minor nit. The complex flavors are well integrated and, for the most part, well-balanced. Very enjoyable.
O: Wild ales are a relatively new style for me, but this is one of the best I've had. The wine barrel aging is readily apparent here, and it really makes this one memorable. Definitely an after dinner sipper, like dessert in a glass. If there were one nit, I would have preferred a slightly more tart finish with a little less oak presence. But it's a minor nit. Consecration is the real deal. Can't wait to try more RR sours. 1,481 characterssiege06nd, Nov 29, 2011

A - Pours a redish brown colour with a thin white head that dies quick.
S - Plenty of funk and some dark fruits.
T - Very tart up front, with plenty of barnyard funk. A little dark fruit on the finish, with some green grape.
M - The body is medium and the carbonation is low. Mid palate is very dry.
O - Very enjoyable American wild ale. 388 characterseric5bellies, Nov 26, 2011

The aroma is reminiscent of a cab, but fruitier and with some slight maltiness.  
The taste oaky, sour fruit, and wine flavors. Dry.
This ale is quite carbonated, like champagne.  Medium body, but heavy with 10% alcohol.  373 charactersKMcG, Nov 25, 2011

Pours mahogany in color, barely opaque and no head. Smells delicious.. Slightly vinegar/ tart and sweet. taste is a blast of tart and and mild sweetness. A little vinegar, currants, and slight oak all balanced perfectly. After taste is all oak.. Some vanilla and currants very mild overall. This sour beer leaves me begging for another sip! 408 charactersJustinMatthew, Nov 20, 2011
3.97/5  rDev -10%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 6. Into a tulip.
Clear and brown-ish. No lacing, pretty much no head. Looks kind of like flat cola.
Smell like oak, plums, currants, leather, vinegar, funk.
Flavor is tart, but not terribly sour. Dark fruit flavors and oak up front, dry and not sweet, finishing with a vinegar sourness and noticeable heat from the alcohol. The ABV is well-hidden, though. 
Mouthfeel is barely carbonated and light. It works.
This is a good sour and very easy to drink for the high ABV. I found Supplication tastier and more complex, though, with noticeable wine-barrel flavors. I'd love to try an older batch of Consecration. 620 charactersmusicforairports, Nov 20, 2011

A - Pours a deep, dark brownish red, almost opaque. Very thin head that dissipates immediately. No lacing. Lots of carbonation. Could see lots of bubbles racing up the side of my glass. Also had some sediment floating around. 
S - Funkiness from the Brett, fruitiness, currants, sour grapes, vinous. The Cabernet pushes its way through as well. This beer smells like it's going to be a sour treat.
T - Taste follows the aroma. Really funky and sour, thanks to the wild yeasts. Some tartness with currants and vinous grapes. And again, the Cabernet seems to make itself present in the background. I didn't pick up much of the oak.
M - Light, crisp with tons of carbonation. Effervescence similar to champagne. Smooth and drinkable. The alcohol is masked perfectly in this 10% ABV beer.
O - Another great brew from Russian River. I've only had a couple of the RR sours but this is one of my favorites. The wonderful taste combined with a pleasant mouthfeel and amazing drinkability make this an excellent sour ale. 1,053 charactersMahlik, Nov 20, 2011

A: Small, bubbly head with little retention. Audible carbonation rose from this transparent redish brown body.
S: Sourness, cider, cherries, oak barrel notes, and that unmistakable funk.
T: Sourness dominates, variety of fruit flavors present. Oak and vanilla become more apparent as the brew warms, definitely a sipper. 
M: Medium bodied, great carbonation, coats mouth thoroughly.
O: Better than my first Wild Ale, but I'm starting to think Wild Ale's aren't my thing. 552 characterstjkinate, Nov 18, 2011

Deep, red brown body, nearing copper. Very scant, tan head.
Loads of balsamic vinegar on the nose. Sour cherries, oak and a slight band aid smell. This has definitely gotten a little funkier with age.
Deep and alluring cabernet grape flavors, followed by a whopping vinegar sourness. Fleshy, tart cherry flavors. Very active body, with a champagne like effervescence.
The sour components of this have stepped up with some age on it, but it is still a fantastic beer. 560 characterslitheum94, Nov 16, 2011

Dark copper pour, as usual. Consecration really needs to warm up to at least 60 degrees before being consumed. The taste and smell improve tremendously as it warns.
Rich bouquet of Cabernet barrels and Belgian tartness in the nose. Oak in the background. Waiting anxiously for the Glade / RR collaboration for household aroma solutions.
Tart cherries and other fruits start things off. Strong Cabernet flavors bring a wine-like character to this brew. Active body stings your tongue with bubbles. Not sure what else to write -- this is noticeably better on draft, and it's utterly amazing.
I feel so spoiled sitting here and ordering another pour. I'm eternally jealous of you locals who can enjoy this every day. 745 charactersbrystmar, Nov 15, 2011

A: Great ruby red color with little head that fades quickly.

M: Slight carbonation but this beer masks the high alcohol level for sure.

Overall, this is the standard grape/wine brown sour that I gauge all others of similar type. This one's nearly flawless. So glad my taste developed the appreciation/love for this.
Love wine-influenced beers, especially sours. This one's perfect for the holidays.

Definitely get the sour currants, the grapes from the Cab, the earthy wood element from the barrel. Med bodied with great carbonation. Some heat that's warming and inviting. Most expensive of the 4 RR sours I've tried, but definitely gonna get another bottle.

Batch 006
A- Pours a beautiful dark reddish brown with 1 finger of off white head that sizzles away quickly due to tons of carbonation. 
S- Lots of funk/lactic notes front from all the different wild yeasts, also some cherry and currant notes as well. Definitely getting some darker grain aroma's in the background with slight vinous notes as well. The barrels come through but don't overpower and blend perfectly. Nice and complex
T- Just like the aroma. Funky barnyard and tart sourness up front and with a good amount of musty oak. The currants create a nice fruit profile and also getting lots of cherry with slight vinous grape flavors. Hard to put my finger on everything
M- Medium bodied with champagne like carbonation and a nice tart sour finish that drys the mouth making you want more and more.

A- Huge pop off of the cork. Pours a deep mahogany/ruby red with a finger of tight off-white head that quickly dissipates to a thin cap.
S- Big mix of lactic sourness, sweet cherry/currant, oaky barrel notes, and some vinous and funky character as well. Really complex.
T- Again, a huge combination of lactic sourness, bretty funk, and surprisingly more fruity sweetness than I found in the nose. I really start to pick up more of the alcohol and barrel notes as the brew warms.
M- Very light, refreshing, and dry. Lively carbonation helps erase any sense of a 10% abv, but the warming in the throat and stomach reveals the true monster.
O- Another home run from RR. Extremely drinkable and I never would have guessed that this brew was 10% abv. This will join Supplication on my constant "wants". 824 charactersstxSS07, Nov 08, 2011

375ml. cork and caged bottle at about fridge temp. shared at a small tasting. batch 006
pours out a darkish red/ brown color with just some thin light tan colored head eventually fading to a ring. minimal lacing.
fruity and funky. the ideal american wild aroma, yet pretty standard for the style. barnyard bretty funk, smells tart, a bit of dark fruits.
a very nice asseritive lemon citrus tartness gets you off the bat. lots of barnyard funk which mostly rules the taste. a bit of dark fruits, and a slight berry flavor, almost a bit winey. 
dry and tart, the sourness is really felt all over the palate and sticks around for a bit. hides the ABV very well. 
gotta love that classic, in your face russian river sourness! a very solid wild that i would never turn down, but perhaps not the best amongst all the RR sours. 864 charactersdogfishandi, Oct 24, 2011

Aroma is tart cidery funk w/ bright notes of sour fruit and oak. A slight solvent aroma lingers.
Taste is tart, sour, oaky and fruity. Lots of wine notes, really dry on the palate. Almost a combination of a lambic, cabernet, and champagne. Really interesting beer to pick apart; complex.

Batch 006
Pours a very deep, dark burgundy with an off white head that lasts for maybe 2 minutes.
Sour cherries, red wine on the nose. This is gonna be a tart one.
The first two sips are extremely tart. Sour cherry is all I taste. Then I settle into the beauty. The tartness yields red wine, oak. Tannic.
Carbonation is on, this is the thickest of the sours by RR and the only evidence that it is the highest in alcohol.
In terms of drinkability and personal taste, I prefer the more delicate Temptation and Sanctification. With that said, this is still a phenomenal brew. 605 charactersdbmernin83, Oct 21, 2011

A: Really dark brown amber body. Nice head at first, but it quickly went away. Gorgeous looking beer.
S: Really rich aroma. Cherries and dark fruits followed by the distinct tartness. Oak characters interplay throughout.
T: Rich malts turn quickly over to cherries then right to lactic sourness. Finishes earthy and tannic. Really long finish that just works.
M: Medium body with lots of carbonation.
O: Infinitely drinkable. I have absolutely no idea where these ABVs are hiding. Looked down and it was already half gone. Wish it wasn't so expensive because this is one of my favorite beers of all time. 661 characterstony223366, Oct 20, 2011

A - Dark maroon in color with a small, tan head.
S - Dark fruits (plum and cherry) mixed with a strong oak characteristic. Very earthy, with a hint of alcohol coming through as well.
T - A complex flavor of black cherries and grapes immediately hit, followed by a mild sourness and tartness. Very sweet and fruity. Hints of oak and other earthy spices come out on the backend. The sourness tends to linger on the tongue.
M - Medium bodied, with a prickly, mild carbonation. Finishes dry.
D - I'm new to sours and this was the first one that I actually enjoyed. It has a wonderful array of flavors backed by a nice sour funkiness. The high alcohol content is hardly noticeable, making this a very drinkable brew. The taste seems to only get better as it warms. Overall, an excellent offering from Russian River and so far, my favorite sour. 889 charactersmooseo, Oct 19, 2011

Does wonders for the flavor. Complex, but not in a " I taste plums, cherries, and earthiness, etc." kind of way like you'd get from wine snobs. Just. Good. Beer. Mouthfeel is great; what looks to be relatively low-carbonated is actually deceptively carbonated, just as a sour should be.

Pours maroon in color with a finger off white head. Left no lacing.
Strong oak, sweet currants and sour vinous notes in the nose. 
Picking up tart dark cherry the currants again and a nice oaky flavor. This one also has a fair amount of sour funkiness. 
Like every wine barrel aged beer I've had the wine tends to overwhelm. If it weren't carbonated I could probably trick my friends into thinking this was a cheap red wine. 
Very nice light tingle from the carbonation. Mouthfeel finishes dry. 
10% ABV is very well masked. If I had to guess I would have thought it was around 6%. Sour beers tend to really cover up any alcohol taste. Enjoyable but at $15 for a 375 its hard to justify the price. I can get a six pack of a very comparable sour for around the same price. 829 charactersIdrinkGas, Oct 10, 2011

T: currants, integrated oak, and again a bit of barnyard.
M: nice and sour, with good acidity. An excellent food beer.
O: Reminds me of wine, and that's a good thing. Very food-friendly, and nuanced similarly to a Cabernet with a bit of age on it.

4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep purple with little head. Light, fruity aromas fill the glass. I get grape, current (of course), cherry and some wine aromas. A bit of sour twinge in the nose as well. The alcohol is all but completely hidden. The taste is bold and fruity. Strawberry, plum, cherry flavors with a sour bite. It fades to currant and bitter black cherries, and the sour taste lingers for a bit. The carbonation in this beer is delicate and you wouldn't notice it if you didn't wonder how the beer is so smooth.
This is a wonderful sour. I tried it first at RR's brewery and it was too much for a first timer. After some Oude Bruins the sour flavor has grown on me and now I can fully appreciate the more potent sours. This is flavorful and complex. The sourness is in perfect equilibrium with the amount of flavor in this beer. All that in a 10% beer that doesn't taste alcoholic at all. A must try, but don't dive into this expensive treat until you've tried a couple other sours, because some context really makes you appreciate it better. 1,027 charactersPhilousa, Sep 26, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From notes - 
Poured into a Russian River glass
Appearance: Pours a dark reddish chestnut brown with lots of carbonation coming from the bottom (almost looks like a sake soda). Almost no head, just a thin layer kept alive from the heavy flow of bubbles.
Aroma: Sour apple and berries, with a hint of sweet wine smell coming from the barrels.
Taste: Sour candy like taste similar to the smell, but making it hard to identify individual flavors. Sour grape, apples, berries, and a wine flavor leading into a sweet finish. The tartness subsides as Consecration warms.
Palette: Smooth, light bodied, and crisp - which is surprising given the amount of carbonation.
Overall: Not as sour or flavorful as New Belgium's La Folie, but better than most other sours I've had - especially given that it doesn't cost near as much as La Folie. A complex blend of fruity flavors but maybe a bit too sour as its a tad over powering. Definitely a contender for one of my favorites. 970 charactersblincoln, Sep 26, 2011
3.58/5  rDev -18.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5From a bottle received in a trade. 
A murky brown with shades of red results from he pour. Nothing too crazy forms on top and the result is no lace to speak of. Not a problem, though, with barrel aging and so forth. Aromas of tobacco, leather anwood dominate with maybe a hint of fruit. Taste is a pretty spot on regarding the nose and that's where it loses me. Consecration is definitely a quality brew but those tastes just aren't for me. A nice feel in the mouth with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. 
Probably not something I'll come back to in the near future, but I can see the appeal and appreciate the quality that Russian River puts out. 658 charactersharrymattcody, Sep 25, 2011

A: If you look at the label on the bottle, that is damn near close to what the body of this beer looks like. Dark-amber brown body with slight velvet hues on the edges that you would see in a Cabernet. Small off white head is produced. Little head retention and no lacing. 
S: Sweet currents paired with sour red grapes, apples with hints of cherry, oak and Brett. The Cabernet Sauvignon is really coming through nicely paring well with the currents. You can smell a slight tartness. 
T: Pretty fantastic array of flavors that hit your tongue from beginning to end. Sweet fruity tastes paired with a decent amount of tartness. Cherry and grape are the stand outs along with Cabernet and hints of oak. 
M: Light to medium bodied with a great amount of carbonation. Smooth, very smooth. 
O: A fantastic beer that I can't believe I have left sitting on the shelves all these times. I have always been skeptical of the price for these but now i know they are the real deal. Will be coming back multiple times for this. 1,059 charactersCaptainTripps, Sep 22, 2011

review #400
pours a deep amber / borderline chestnut tone with ruby highlights while yielding a very short-lived 1/4" tan head. no lacing.
bold nose opens with a blast of currants. sour / tart with notes of cherry, vinegar, and maybe a touch of oak.
wow, flavor really impresses, following, even exceeding the aroma. wild ales have never appealed to me on the whole, but this beer demonstrates what one can be if done right. leave it to russian river to accomplish that feat: just very impressively crafted. sour to the point of puckering but not overdone. virtually no trace of the 10% ABV. medium bodied with lively carbonation.
overall, a hell of a sour. of the few dozen or so different wild ales i've sampled, this is on a very short list for overall best. neck and neck with temptation. 843 charactersperrymarcus, Sep 20, 2011

Pours a dark ruby red color w/ a sliver of a head on it. It looks very similar to a glass of wine, or a port. Head is gone within 10 seconds. Small amount of lacing on my glass, not much there at all. Nose is wonderfully complex. Wine, port, berries, funk, sweetness, some yeast all in there. Really opens up as it warms and airs out. Zero alcohol in the nose. I have a feeling I'm really going to like this one. Taste is equally good. Sour, but not overly so. All the smells really come out, and the flavor just blows my taste buds out of the water. cherries and some oak come out as the beer opens up. This is a very tasty Wild Ale, and I can't believe that it's 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is medium, w/ good carbonation and a dry finish. Almost a wine-like dry aftertaste. Overall this is a fantastic beer, and I would buy this one again in a heartbeat. Cheers! 867 charactersjayhawk73, Sep 17, 2011

A: Pours a reddish/chestnut brown with mahogany highlights. Very thin head that dissipates quickly. Thin lacing and low carbonation.
N: Apple juice, red grapes, maybe blackberries, oak, vanilla and a hint of Brett. You can also smell the Cabernet Sauvignon aromas left over from the barrel aging.
T: Very big tartness upfront which makes it hard to identify what I'm tasting. Possibly a mix between vinegar, red wine and lactic acid. This is followed by a sharp acidic fruitiness of apple cider, red grapes/wine and what could only be the Currants. There is also some raspberry going on. Wood/barrel/saw dust becomes apparent in the finish along with some tobacco that seems to balance everything out in the end.
M: Light-medium bodied, tart, sour, clean and very dry.
O: Complex, but I feel my sour taste buds just haven't developed as of yet. Comes off a little bit harsh and is focused more on red wine flavors. I do enjoy some of the flavors though especially the woodiness and the tobacco in the finish. The nose smells absolutely phenomenal. I will respect it for what it is. 1,096 charactersjustintcoons, Sep 16, 2011

A: pours a deep reddish brown, somewhat murky, not much head retention, decent lacing
S: things starts of acidic with notes of vinegar pairs with cherry, oak and vanilla. Varying levels of fruitiness and acidity come through making for a complex nose.
T: lactic acid and tartness up front, big time puckering, followed by a sweeter and fruitier middle, this is followed up by a considerable amount of oak with a touch of funk, and the tartness returns on the finish.
MF: high carbonation, refreshing mouthfeel

3.79/5  rDev -14.1%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5375ml brown glass bottle with an intricate cork+steel wire cap served into a hefeweissbier glass in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations were high as this is me second favourite brewery in the world and me favourite in the Americas. 
A: Pours a three finger head of slight cream, fair thickness, and poor retention. Colour is a dark copper with the potential for overcarbonation, judging by the bubbles. It's appealing in a generic sense. 
Sm: Aroma consists of souring hops - which aren't overpowering like some lambics, wine, grapes, mild wood notes, and some lactic notes. Aroma is of moderate to mild strength. 
T: A very complex taste, consisting primarily of souring hops but with a wine "shell" around it. Some cedar comes through, particularly from the midpoint through the climax. If berries are present, they're buried. The finish smacks of grapes, which closes out the flavour nicely. No alcohol comes through.
Mf: Very smack your lips pleasant due to the grape finish - sort of a slight Welch's commercial effect. It's smooth and wet all around, but perchance a touch too thick. Overcarbonation is slight but existent. 
Dr: It hides its ABV very well, and has some great complex flavours, but does suffer from some minor issues, namely overcarbonation. I could see this getting better with age, but it'd be very difficult to drink more than one. It's nice to kick back and enjoy after returning from work, but sippers only go so far. Excellent value in California. 1,510 characterskojevergas, Sep 10, 2011

T - Currant flavor is more fresh than the raisin-like flavor it has in the bottle. Sourness and yeast of course. The tannin's aren't as pronounced. Finshes dry.

this poured a nice clean no head pour, into a fading dark amberish color, not cloudy but completely opaque. the nose of this beer screams currants and sour tangy goodness. a very vinous aroma accompanies the fruit sour. this beer keeps reminding me of supplication which should be kinda expected. the taste is a very short lived wineish like flavor with a little brett funkyness there. this one is a lively beer like the rest of the RR sours. the carbonation kinda takes away from the taste. 
overall its awesome and a good drinker, you dont know its 10% abv at all while you drink it. 665 characterskaips1, Aug 29, 2011

4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Russian River : Consecration
12 oz corked and caged bottle. Pours a rich mahogony/ruby color, more or less clear and a small fizzy head forms and crackles away. Aroma is big and wine like, alittle alcohol peaks through, and then theres the funk which all make for a complex nose. In the taste, almost sweet and sour with grape notes, oaky tannins, bitter brett offering a strong sour, and alcohol is almost un-noticed. Malt body is more or less overrun by these strong flavors, but there is a light touch of caramel. Its all about the lovely sour in this beer though, and the delicate flavor of currents. The feel is medium bodied and semi dry. Overall, this is one hell of a beer and I wish I could get it all the time with a reasonable price tag. Mighty fine. 762 charactersStinkypuss, Aug 24, 2011

4.43/5  rDev +0.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4batch 004x5
appearance - big head off controlled pour right after decorking. a dark sherry red. very active at first. almost opaque. head dies off pretty quickly and almost no lacing is left except a bit at the rim
smell - oak and whiskey right after the bottle is opened, then after pour brett and cherries, some currants i suppose but mostly just smells like cherries. sugar and caramel and a bit of wine. the only reason its not a 5 is because of the oak and whiskey dying out so quickly and brett and cherries dominating so heavily.
taste - oak on first sip comes in the strongest. brett and sour cherries rule afterwards. some tannins. very nice but wish the oak would come in a bit more.
mouthfeel - silky smooth a bit sugary. carbonation is funny. thought it might be overcarbonated but if anything its under. body is dead on. 837 charactersclaytong, Aug 23, 2011

S - A great sour funk on the head. That is mixed with some sweet fruits and slight sugars on the front. Then a great amount of oakiness in the middle and end to smooth it out. 
T & M & D - strong but not overwhelming sourness up front. The mouth opens to a good mix of sweet tart fruits like unripe apples and some dark fruits and currants. Then The oak comes in allowing the sour to die a little and making the finish sweet and candy like. Very smooth on the palate. The beer is crisp and carbonated making it refreshing. 
O - very complex and tasty beer. The sour level is perfect and the fruit profile mixed with oak makes each sip interesting and tasty. I have a few in the cellar and I'm excited to see what age does to it.

Churchill's Pub & Grille
San Marcos, CA
(Aged 2 years)
Dark cherry red and auburn, bordering on brown, with a thin khaki head. Spotted lacing down the glass.
An incredible array of aromas that come together magnificently: sweet cherries and currants provide the primary sweetness, tart, biting, stinging sour notes leap from the glass, all smoothed out by an inviting, welcoming aroma of rich wood, earth, and vanilla. 
The taste is just as spectacular as the nose. I've had this beer a number of times, and this 2-year-old version has been by far the standout. The sourness is still there, biting and stinging, balanced with the rich, earthy, and sweet flavors from the fruit, all alongside the rich yet subtle notes from the barrel. There's an underlying sticky toffee sweetness coming through I don't remember in previous versions, and, as always, there isn't the slightest hint of a 10% ABV.
Smooth, light yet full, crisp, and refreshing.
An absolutely perfect, infinitely complex, sour ale. I'm happy Josh ordered this 2-year-old bottle, as I can never keep myself from opening the ones I buy for myself. 
An all-time favorite of mine. 1,170 charactersehammond1, Aug 17, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pour is a murky brown color, glows in the light, slight haze to it. Head is pithy and large bubble, doesnt generate much. Looks very oily and slick. Aromas are of soured grapes and dark fruit. A hint of oak woodiness can be found, but the buggies really jump out at you. Flavor is mellow and soft, bunches of sour fruits and a mellow caramell, oak, nuttiness to the finish. Warming on the palate, the body doesn't lend itself to the abv, but the finish reveals a little heat once warmed. Very nice brew, mellow, perfect sour level and nice funk to it. 551 charactersTripphop, Aug 17, 2011

reviewed from notes.
Appearance: light brown bodied beer with redish highlights. White whispy head with lots of small bubbles. 
Smell: Cranberries, oak and wine.
Taste: Cranberries and currant. Tannins and oak. Moderate sour taste of vinegar takes over the taste and finish of this beer. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Prickly and clean mouthfeel.
Overall: Interesting sour beer. Not my favorite sour we had that night, but its decent! 646 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 15, 2011

A - pours medium brown with a small head. Head recedes leaving little lacing on down and some traces down the side.
S - sweet smell of wine dominates. grapes and tanins with little alcohol at the end.
T/M - overwhelmingly sour throughout though sweet at the front. bits of fruitiness. a leathery taste towards the back. leaves a steel like feel to the tongue but have a clean finish.

Pours a ruddy, reddish brown, mostly clear with very thin head. Nose smells sour right off the bar (yes, I know sour is not a smell). Wine barrels and red wine vinegar, plus raisins soaking in vodka come to mind, a hint of smooth leather and a suggestion of cranberry.
Palate is vinegar sour right off the bat. Flavors of leather, dried cranberry, used wine barrel, earthen clay and plum mix together. Good complexity, quite sour, long finish, but rather still (in terms of carbonation).
Not my favorite RR sour. Still love me that Temptation. I will say that the AVB is really well hidden... This is FFO Flemish reds. 714 charactersSFLpunk, Aug 11, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is a bottle of batch 2X1. Thanks to the kind friends who brought it back from the US for me.
This pours a clear but dark brown colour with rich, ruby highlights. The light tan head dissipates quickly but still leaves a little ring of bubbles around the glass. About as much as can be hoped for in a sour beer with this level of alcohol.
Rich, sweet fruity aroma with those red currants really shining come through first. Next is a vinous, leathery, funky aroma with a lovely crispness to it. Good definition too.
The flavour is good but not spectacular. I get a nice balance of sweetness and sourness with the fruitiness really coming through. There's a bit of funk too. The main problem for me is the astringent, mild bitterness that comes through the finish. While I love the flavour this bitterness detracts for me.
There's a medium-light body with moderately-high carbonation. This is good but the astringency also lets this down.
Overall, a very good beer. It looks great, smells great and tastes good with just a small astringency problem which comes from the use of barrels and bugs. A great effort by RR and I look forward to trying more of their sours if and when I make it to California. 1,207 charactersdgilks, Aug 10, 2011

A: Dark reddish amber, almost brownish like you would expect with an aging wine. Only a ring of off white head. Not much retention, and no lacing.
S: Funky red wine and red currant and oak/cinnamon/spice from the barrel treatment. Black cherry in the secondary. Faint dark dried fruit as it warms up.
T: Currant, brett, spice (pepper, cinnamon), red wine. Tart but a grade below mouthpuckering. A touch of sweetness. Long finish. 
M: Crisp. Carbonation is on the higher end. Medium bodied.
O: This is definitely my favorite of the easily available sour 'tion beers (Supplication, Sanctification, Temptation). A sour beer for red wine lovers. 681 characterspmarlowe, Aug 10, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 006 Poured from 375ml into Chimay goblet
A - Poured like a cocacola at first; fizzy with a quickly appearing and quickly diminishing head leaving no lacing. Also similar in color, although hazy. At first, I was planning on rating the appearance much lower due to the lack of a stable foam, but what it revealed when it disappeared was the most active fluid surface I'd ever seen on a beer, bubbles wisping around and dancing carbonation on the surface that showed me an active beer. Makes me feel like I'm about to drink a living thing, which I really dig. 
S - Strong upfront dark cherry tartness with a very muted malty note underneath that seems to tessellate perfectly in place with the tartness. An almost tannic like red wine aroma as well, that reveals a bit of sourness at the end of the tart. 
T - Very wine-like in flavor, as could have been expected, with an extremely sour bite to finish it off. The sourness chased away the dark fruit notes I got in the nose, but that doesn't bother much, as the sourness accentuates the citrusy flavor of the hops. No hoppy bitterness, preserving the flavor of the hops, while allowing all the bitterness to flow from its sourness. Altogether solid flavor profile that beguiled me at first and commanded my full attention.
M - Crisp and effevescent, and yet somehow still managed to be silky... I'm really not sure how this overall texture was pulled off, but its one of a kind. Hides it's booziness well in the medium body.
O - This particular beer confused me more than anything. Granted, I've not had much experience with sours to date, but I still imagine this has greater depth than most. I'd say its sourness in taste overpowered some of the darker fruits that the scent gives off, and the final product ends up tasting a bit like a carbonated grapefruit juice without any sweetener. But there is much more here. As it warmed, I felt that the malt I detected in the nose came out a bit more, but the yeastiness was seemingly lost in the sour. I enjoyed this, and have a bottle in the cellar that I look forward to revisiting in a year's time to see how it changed. 2,129 charactersWreckoncile, Aug 10, 2011

A- Deep mahogany color. Minimal head dissipates rapidly leaving a thin ring of tan bubbles hugging the outside of the glass.
S- Aroma of sweet dark berries and brett. Smells acidic and funky. 
T- Starts out tart and sour with a nice flavor from the currants coming in mid palate. Notes of berry and oak from the cab barrels are present in abundance. Barnyard funk is present throughout, and the finish is semi dry with a lingering tartness. 
M- Feel is medium with a nice prickly level of carbonation which works well with the tartness of the beer. 
O- One of my favorite Russian River brews. The wonderful meritage of sour, tart currants coupled with the complexity of the oak and Cabernet make for a very enjoyable sour experience. Highly recommended! 802 charactersSideswipe, Aug 09, 2011

S - A musty aroma of damp dirt and cobwebs with sweet fruity notes of dark cherry and (presumably) currants.
T - Tart cherries and sweet, dry caramel malt. Tartness creeps into the fruit character towards the finish and the acidity lingers on the palate.
M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, and a very dry finish.
D - This is a fruity and tart wild ale, but with a lot of dry, thick malt and enough funk to keep it interesting. 580 charactersnickfl, Aug 05, 2011

Consecration pours a murky, blood red. There's a brown, sand-colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. A few legs on my glass. From appearances alone (minus the head, of course), this could pass for red wine.
A funky, deep, and complex nose. There's an almost pungent, abrasive sourness and funk at work. Underneath that funk is an aroma of currants and, to a lesser degree, cherries. I would almost describe the smell as vinegary.
Wonderful vinous sourness in the taste. The red wine characteristics of this beer shine beautifully. Again, I can pick up some currants and cherries. Even though this is a young bottle, the funk is quite strong. There's not even a slight hint of alcohol in the taste. With so many strong flavors competing for attention, the balance is spectacular.
So smooth, with perfect carbonation. I hate to keep referencing wine, but this is lush enough to merit that comparison. For such a sour beer, this is very easy to drink.
My favorite sour from RR's regular lineup. Big but not brash, simultaneously over-the-top in flavor yet somehow restrained, this is fantastic. I would love to see the funk develop in an older bottle, but alas, I'm an impatient man. 1,239 charactersamphion1065, Aug 05, 2011

4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 004x2. The cork opened with a solid pop, leaving a trailing wisp of water vapor rising slowly out of the neck of the bottle. A brisk pour into my Duvel tulip resulted in a bit under a half a finger of offwhite foam sitting atop an effervescent dark amber colored body. The head disappeared pretty quickly, but the there was a steady hiss of carbonation from the bubbles shooting up to the surface of the glass. Nose was light vinegar, tart cherries, brett, oaky and vineous.
Taste was dried fruit, like cherries and currents. Also got cranberry and red grape. The oak flavor that was so strong in the smell is much more subdued in the taste. There is a slight bit of alcohol warmth, but it is surprisingly not noticeable. Mouthfeel was medium, with a good amount of tingly carbonation and a dry finish. The beer was tart, but not over-puckeringly so. 857 characterssurlytheduff, Aug 02, 2011

S: Dried dark fruit right up front. The sour scent reminds me of dried cherries. Behind this is the dry red wine scent. 
T: The fruity sweetness is right up front followed closely by the sourness. The finish is of dry red wine. The alcohol is excelently hidden. Quite unique and quite nice. The sour compliments the initial dark fruit sweetness but doesn't take total control of the beer.
M: Fizzy, dry, obviously pretty sour. This beer is unique because you really feel all the different qualities of the beer on your tongue on different areas. 
O: This is without a doubt one of the best "sours" i've had and really hit the mark with all the flavors. The most surprising thing is that the alcohol is almost totally undetectable. Great beer! 872 charactersrrski198, Aug 02, 2011

T - Tastes like pinot noir, with a nice hint of carbonation. Beautiful taste of the currants, gives it a tart cherry flavor. 10%, but not boozy tasting at all.
M - Smooth and carbonated. Really has the more of the feel of champagne then beer.

4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed on-tap @ Naja's Place in Redondo Beach, CA for $8. Tapped into a 12oz Wine Glass from the Another RR Cross Tap Handle but couldn't make out what colors it was or any description because it was so far down the line. This brew was also not on the "Tap List" Here! It was available in bottle so I just asked for the hell of it to see if it was a secret one as well, and it was!
Aroma- Starts off with an enormous wild and sour cherry aroma. Has the normal goaty/earthy hints and is blended well with the cherry. Very acidic and great to sniff at. 
Appearance- Received with a 1 finger head that dies quickly. Light amber/reddish color body that has great clarity. Effervescent and leaves good lacing.
Flavor- Strong cherry from the beginning of the drink. Extremely sour and acidic and just for what the style calls for! All the barnyard characteristics appropriate and has a light sweetness but is then forgotten because of the puckering finish. 
Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, High Carbonation, High tartness, and leaves sharp cherries on the tip of the tongue. 
Overall Impression- A very straight forward Wild/Sour! Pleasant, nice cherry taste/aroma, and well balanced. I am excited I got to try these two RR brews @ Naja's and will be keeping my fingers crossed to enjoy many more in the future. 1,311 charactersDCon, Jul 31, 2011

Mouthfeel: A bit too thin body with low-medium carbonation.

N - Cider vinegar-like acidity, massive tart cherries, red wine vinegar and lots of winey notes folds into an almost clove-like suggestion, possibly whole nutmeg, green peppercorn, maybe figs or rose hips; the nose roams wildly and is pretty perfumy not like a Supplication which was more subtle. Wafting herbal aromas balanced with sour milk, wet and old hay, top soil.
T/M - Wow...teeth chattering tartness, cloying sour and irony mouthfeel; blackberries, raspberries, black peppercorn and figs; lemon skin, much more drying tannins in a lasting finish than the Supplication; leather strap, blackcurrants. 
D - Not sure if I could drink more than one of those but this is definitely the most interesting sour beer I have had. I think I prefer the sessionable enjoyability of Supplication. We had both of these back-to-back in a recent sour tasting. 933 charactersbiga7346, Jul 30, 2011
4.56/5  rDev +3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Beer pours a slightly hazy reddish brown, actually reminds me a lot of Coca-Cola especially the way the off white head fizzes up and then dissipates. Aroma is amazing, very complex for any beer. It shares some aromas with Cabernet, which is not surprising given that this beer is aged in Cab barrels. Black currants, red fruit, vanilla, cola and tobacco all come to mind. This beer has a moderate sourness with a fairly dry finish and just a bit of bitterness, I read biegaman's review mentioning that he associated the bitterness with tomato and although I don't get that specifically I will say that it has a certain umami quality that is usually associated with tomatoes, so I could see the comparison. Overall this is a very good offering from one of my favorite breweries and I think it has amazing complexity that is best enjoyed over a long period of time, letting the beer warm a bit and change over and hour or two. 924 charactersBeerAmbassador, Jul 28, 2011
4.19/5  rDev -5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5All that time spent in the barrel has given the beer a murky prune juice complexion and off colour that resembles a raisin. That said, it does glows like pomegranate juice against the light. (Where would the beer reviewer be without fruits?) The extended slumber also killed off most head retention. Check that, all of it. It has ravished its once beautiful looks. 
If you weren't aware that this was aged in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels you'd be astonished at how the beer smells so strikingly like the red wine, right down to the perfumed alcohol esters, oak wood and dusty tannins. There's also, of course, lots of dark berry fruit, enough to be unsure of how much can be attributed to the currants and how much to the barrel.
The bouquet really grew on me with warmth, and definitely matured into something that you could sit, sniff and deliberate about for hours. The flavour, however, was a little less dignified, notably because it reminded me so simply of a Cabernet Sauvignon - worse actually, a slightly watered down one with far more oak barrel and tobacco bitterness present. 
That's not to imply, however, that it isn't still considerably flavourful. And it's unarguably unique. For one it shows virtually no indication of its strength and has a lot of wild berry fruitiness. The oak is concentrated, persistent and astonishingly nutty, with notes of Brazil nut and coconut shavings in time creeping out from all that toasty wood flavour. 
Unlike other Russian River beers, however, I find this one to have a fairly shallow complexity; its tartness is obvious but diluted, the bitterness tasting like tomato or tobacco leaf and its acidity and phenols - because they're so pronounced in red wines - are dulled in the shadow of the Cabernet Sauvignon flavour. Unlike most sours, the finish is unexciting and fleeting.
Consecration is an artistic and innovative experiment... that for all its intricacies and inventiveness ends up tasting a lot like watered-down cab sauvignon. What to make of that? It blurs the lines not only of the beer/wine world, but of the perspectives of the reviewer too - $11 is a lot for a bottle of any beer, but at $23 this would make a reasonably priced bottle of wine.

S: Smells like it looks. More leather. Some oak. Fruit: cherry, raisins, dark grapes. Lots of wood. 
T: Starts off with a blend of tart cherries mixed with any earthy barnyard quality. Exceedingly complex. Notes of leather and tobacco mix with cherries and a tannic bitterness. A little oak. Slightly vinous. 
M: On the thinner side of medium. Tart and lightly acidic with drying tannins. 
O: Offering up a wonderful blend of flavors, I found this beer to be sour, tannic and complex. Very good. 605 charactersFlorida9, Jul 26, 2011

Appearance is reddish brown with very little head. The nose has grapes, black currants, cherry and a tart quality. Its` taste is sour, red wine, lemon and is also sweet. A nice mix of different flavors are here. MF is medium with not very much carbonation. This is a nice wild/sour beer which lived up to its` solid reputation. 350 charactersmltobin, Jul 24, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -8.8%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5such a fun and unique brew!
No, it's not a new top favorite, and I probably won't seek it out again. But this was a fun beer to drink, the consummate craft beer drinking experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the beer, and the creativity and craftsmanship involved in its creation.
A - Unimpressive. What is there to say about Brown? It's just blah. This beer has an especially fizzy cap and appears far lighter in body than I had expected.
A- Fun! There's a mild tinge of vinegar, some tobacco (kinda reminded me of dip... weird), and grapes. Very wine like.
T- if you told me it were wine I'd have never doubted you until the second sip. There's a real sour twist, but it's not unbecoming. It's enough to leave a real sense of satisfaction and cleanse the palate. More juicy than beer like.
Tastes of Yellow Tail wine, Lemon Heads and Pop Rocks, Fuji Apple peel, dingy earthiness.
The further it drinks (warms) the less like wine and the more like hard cider, this beer becomes. And then, as you go further still, the sourness becomes quite biting.
M- The effervescence of this beer pairs well with the tartness. It's light-bodied, crisp and for all the sweetness, it finishes dry. The flavor might overwhelm most, but all have to agree the body lends exceptional drinkability.
0_ I dunno which demographic they were trying to entice... grade school kids who like sour candies or wine drinkers... I think they'll attract both. It's a contradiction: it's both cutting-edge on the modern beer scene, but also employs throwback qualities, like souring and aging in wooden barrels. It's a spunky beer, that packs a lot of flavor and alcohol into a compact frame. 
I actually had a sample of this on draught a while back and didn't like it, I'm glad I gave this bottle with its hefty price tag a chance! 1,801 charactersMONKandTUCK, Jul 24, 2011

4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5375ml bottle into Duvel tulip. Batch 004x4, so brewed 3/25/2009, bottled 2/5/2010. Thanks to BA msulinski, who included this as a very generous extra in a recent trade.
Appearance: Free pour yields a quarter inch fizzy white head that dissipates immediately. Pours a semi-translucent dark red orange and leaves occasional short lived spots of lacing.
Smell: From the bottle: Dark fruit, red wine, vinegar. Fruity. In the glass: Tons of oak at first. Dark fruit, red grapes. With warmth, chocolate and a faint mustiness come out. That deep grape/red wine/dark fruit almost mushroom-like note from the taste comes out with time as well. 
All told, the smell doesn't "come together" as greatness, but it does enhance the flavor, and all its elements are very good.
Taste: Whoa, this beer delivers the sensory adventure you want from an expensive American wild ale.
First sip starts smooth and oaky, then yields a giant fruit and tobacco hit with a cutting acidity. Finishes boozy and oaky. Second sip starts out with deep, complicated and unique notes of grapes and currants, which last for a second or two before the giant acidity hits and the flavor opens up with chocolate, tobacco, cabernet sauvignon, oak; all robust and well balanced. 
This is a hell of a beer. With warmth and time, lots of different flavors come out; a heavy molasses note, greater basement/dungeon depths, etc. I don't think you can seriously grade a beer like this below a 5... it's accomplishing exactly what the brewer intended, yielding a too-many-to-keep-track set of distinct flavors that are all bold and complimentary. Perhaps one could argue that it's too hot (or too acidic), but the flavors are bold enough to justify it and then some.
Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied. Very carbonated. Super acidic; almost too much so. Long finish.
Overall: My gut reaction was to give this a 5.0 for greatness. Then I thought, "well, there's other flavors, oak influences, etc in other beers that I prefer to this one..." Then the great, leathery, grape/currant/red wine flavors completely won me over. 
Another classic from Russian River. Worth trading for or paying its hefty price tag. Excellent. 2,184 charactersPahn, Jul 12, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 3.
S: Vanilla oak barrel maltiness, moderate barnyard, dried fruit, cherries and currants mostly, moderate earthy cinnamon, some clove, almost gingerbread smelling believe it or not. If not for the moderate funky notes, would be very x-mas smelling, i get cherry fruit gummies as well.
L: Clear dark crimson brown with no head, light ring of foam with rabid bubbles rising to the surface creating some dusting.
T: Tart cherries up front with a semi-sweet caramel maltiness. Carbonated bite leads to some sour cherries and a very lactic sour bite (some red vinegar), drying the palate. Some wine like tannins in the finish.
M: Medium mouthfeel, medium high carbonation. Alcohol slightly present.
Really enjoyed this beer, definitely on par with tempation and supplication, maybe a little behind. Definitely has a more tannin and red vinegar note. But great overall. 875 charactersbum732, Jul 12, 2011
3.57/5  rDev -19%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip, small bottle carefully poured. Shared last weekend with SundaySour.
Batch: shamefully I forgot to note; it's always important!
A: Light brown sugar with a filmy head and no lacing. A solution of brown sugar and maple syrup. Looks very scotch like! Soft dark reds and lighter shimmering shades dominate.
S: Up front cherry skins and dried gojji berries. Wood acidity is prominent, but not too invasive. Fresh split raisins in dark cane sugars, not too sweet, and featuring a rapid dryness. 
T: Acidic woods, red wine vinegars, and sprits of lime juice. A light lingering lime salt flavor with white citrus connective tissues, but not quite rinds. The currents really tang the finish, and bitter in the mouth. Each sip relieves astringency with refreshing sweetness. 
M: Light flat body that has all its sensations overwhelmed by tartness. Not much here, flavor sensations thwart subtle mouth feels. Fairly wet in the mouth, light aspirin comes very late; leaves a bit of a cotton mouth. 
O: I've had this a few times, and this wasn't the strongest showing. I wish I had made note of the batch as it was really quite a bit more acidic than I ever had before. This was my first time out of the bottle, but even then the youth of the wood and harshness of young currents pillaged the palate. This beer is much better in different batches, but I would say that the taste character is fairly the same. There was a bit more lime/vinegar than I'd like, as the flavors are already acidic and bold enough. By no means a crap or unexciting beer, but I dreamed of acidic remedies after this one. 1,621 charactersCavery, Jul 09, 2011

Batch 2 consectration: poured a somewhat clear, yet opaque brownish. No head to speak of (but a small pour), really nice sour smell. Very balanced sweet tart. This is a really appetizing beer on the nose. Taste follows the nose a bit more tart that I would’ve expected, but this is very nicely balanced and very well done. Mouth puckeringly sour, but quite tasty. Smooth as the day is long, but the puckering. Very good sour, the more Russian river I try, the more I understand their fantastic reputation.

A - Pours a dark brown with red tint. Very clear and bubbly. No real head to speak of, but there's some nice action going on around the edges of the glass.
S - Tons of currants, cherries, and oak. The finish is very musky and funky. 
T - Extremely sour. This is probably the most sour beer I've ever had, even more so than the Belgian lambics and guezes I've tried. Cherries and oak. The sourness masks a lot of the fruit flavors, but the brett funk is on full display. Delicious.
O - This was a very good beer and I'm glad I got to try this. Its not on par with the belgian sours, but this is a very impressive american wild. It was my first RR'ion beer and from what I read this is the bottom of the tier. Can't wait to try some of the other ones. 878 charactersdavey101, Jun 30, 2011
3.57/5  rDev -19%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5375 ml Batch III poured into a snifter. "Consecration is a dark Belgian style ale aged in American oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels. Not only do we use Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, & Pediococcus, we also add currants to beer while it is aging in the barrels"
Appearance: Clear and deep rust brown with a small, dark, "soda" head that fizzed away rather early and left no lacing whatsoever. 3/5
Aroma: Fruity with strongest notes of cherries and some currants with warmth. But the aroma, in my opinion, was eclipsed by intense, one-dimensional sourness. Decidedly funky nonetheless. 3.5/5
Taste: A clean and intensely sour beer, with minor hints of the base beer. Unfortunate, in my opinion. Wood is felt, but mostly mouth puckering sour, and that's it. Well, the funk is unmistakable, but for a sour brownish ale, Supplication was definitely better. 3.5/5
Mouthfeel: Like its other brethren, medium bodied, yet quite clean with a long, oaky finish. 4.5/5
Overall, my least favorite among the bunch and only because the base beer, and fruit, seem to have lost to sourness & funk. Did too many cooks (bugs) ruin the broth? 3.5/5 1,130 characterstewaris, Jun 28, 2011

Pours dark ruby brown with less no head at all. Lots of carbonation bubbles rush to the top of the glass. Very nice clarity. 
Nose is brett, earth, and wood. Touches of fruit. As it warms, the oak and fruit become more prominent. 
Funk takes forefront in the taste. Very smooth with a pleasant tart finish. The fruit makes a wonderful contribution, similar to a Kriek. 
Quite dry, impressive for 10% ABV. The high carbonation works really well. 
Overall, a spectacular showcase of RR's ability to make a funky sour beer. 584 charactersmondegreen, Jun 25, 2011

T - Batch 001 was a bit one-dimensional in its tartness with only a touch of sweet currant flavor, but batch 005 had a much better flavor profile that was nicely complex with wood and fruit and tart.

Purchased through High-Time Wine Cellars, Costa Mesa, Cali
Price - $11.97/bottle
Pours amber in color with a full head of foam that quickly fades to almost nothing. The clarity is clear with champagne like bubbles rising to the top. The appearance looks authentic to the style. 
Hold the doors, I think Parliament just walked into the building led by none other than George Clinton himself. Wow that's got some vinegar funk to it. 
A big blast of sour cherries hits the tongue head on followed by cranberries, white grapes and wine. The oak really comes through on this one and adds to the flavor profile. I can't believe this is 10%, wow!! 
Puckering from the start but refreshing. Not as smooth as some of the other sours I've experienced. Medium body with a delicate amount of carbonation. In the end it's a little too dry to drink one after another for my tastebuds.
Overall a great example of the style and one I'm working to appreciate. 990 characters05Harley, Jun 20, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to GRG1313 for the opportunity. Batch 004X2 served in my CL tulip at 53 degrees. Pours a translucent reddish-brown with a loose, quarter inch off-white head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders leaving a broken, sudsy skim across the surface. No lacing on this one. Fantastic nose - oak, buttery notes, currants and a vinous quality all interwoven into a complex palate of aromas. Taste follows nose - no real surprises here. The flavors are refreshingly tart and the alcohol seems non-existent, despite the 10% abv indicated on the label. Mouthfeel is light in body with a carbonation that falls just short of lively. The tartness lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks and there is also a slight acidic burn that lingers on the lips between quaffs. Not much more to say - a solid American wild with a great deal of complexity. Another impressive beer from this brewer. 915 charactersJwale73, Jun 20, 2011

Pours a deep amber red. Off the of the pour the head dissipates almost immediately. The smell is that deep funk that we have all come to love with wild ales. A bit of cherry comes off the nose also. Taste is a mouth puckering sour with loads of tart cherry. The mouthfeel is light and playful, but not flat by any means. Quite and exceptional beer from an exceptional brewery. 469 charactersdeathcharms, Jun 19, 2011

First had this in a 750ml bottle, but I have had it on tap as well. A tasty, dark, sour ale wood aged with black currants. After Pliny the Younger, this is my favorite RR brew.
Pours an attractive vermillion-mahogany color with a delicate beige head with some tinges of ruby here and there. Sour aroma, dark fruits, leather, and vinegar. Flavor starts out sweet almost like a kriek or framboise, with notes of cherry, blackcurrants. Soon turns more tart with the more sour qualities of cherries, red wine, and hints of vinegar coming through. In turn moves to more dried fruit--figs, prunes, dried cherries--soaked in wood-aged wine. Finishes acidic and bitter overall, yet still smooth. Medium body, complex, and very enjoyable. 771 charactersRifugium, Jun 10, 2011

Appearance: This is a gorgeous looking beer! Red with mahogany hues around the sides with a two fingers thick head. The head resides into a thin lacing on the top of the glass.
Aroma: Sour cherries, vanilla, oak, a tart pungency from the brett are the aromas that dominate, but none of them are over powering the other. 
Taste: Your taste buds are hit with a cherry tart sourness at first and then are soothed by a slight sweetness. It’s not as sour as I was expecting, more balanced. 
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, which made me happy, because I was worried it would be over carbonated due to the fact that when the cork popped it was over flowing for a good 30 seconds.
Overall: Very good and I would highly recommend if you can get your hands on some. The alcohol is very well hidden for a 10% ABV beer. 895 charactersjamescain, Jun 01, 2011

Very tart, funky and vinegary smelling, with overtones of cherries. Not much else is going on really, but it does smell wonderful! 
Lovely tasting stuff. Very sour, with vinegary overtones, currants and cherries fill out the fruity flavors too, followed by a pungent sour brett funkiness. 
Feel is pretty light and zesty, with high acidity and light carbonation, leaving a lingering sour cherry aftertaste. Not much alcohol taste for 10% ABV. 
Another great Russian River beer. Not that much different from some of their other sours, but they all are quite delicious. 655 charactersAlCaponeJunior, May 28, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this at Toronado's 3rd anniversary. Love that place!
As a celebration for there anniversary they popped open a bottle of batch #2. What luck right?
So overall I really liked it. I wish I had other batches to compare to. This one is very sour some probably wont like how sour this is but I definitely would recommend if you love sours. 
Smell was very similar to other consecrations very sour, tart, vinegar, I smelt a little creamy banana.
Color was red with little bit of brownish hues. good carbonation similar to other consecrations.
taste was sour, tart, creamy with a little bit of vanilla and tangy grape/cherry sourness with tingle on the back of the throat. 
I had a Malhuer 12 before they gave us this and I had to finish it after the consecration, it gave the Malhuer a big hop characteristic which was kinda interesting. So i don't recommend tasting other beers after this one. 
Thank you Toronados! 920 charactersLessurluck, May 25, 2011

Pours an amber/ruby color with almost no head. just a tad lingered. Nose of wild cherry, wine vinegar, and vanilla. mouth feel is great, perfect amount of carb. taste of sour cherry and vanilla, almost a hint of white zinfandel in end to go along with the booze bite. i did not find this overly sour, it was balanced nicely with the wine/cherry/vanilla flavors 386 charactersSDDanC, May 25, 2011

Batch 003 from a 750ml bottle.
Let me start by saying I know people go apeshit for this beer. I get that I am possibly a minority on not liking this style. The fact is, I rate a beer based on how it tastes to me. Style aside.
Pours a reddish ice tea color with a bit of off white head. Brett sour funk with a bit of vanilla note. Incredibly sour and tart. Puckering even. After I'm done praying this sip gets over with I do notice a booze bite on the backend. Overly tart and something I really don't wish to have again.
I'm getting stinkeye from the crowd on this one. Maybe rightfully so. Last I checked though I don't get mad if you dislike the ipa or stout in your glass. 719 charactersTheDudeRules, May 23, 2011
3.66/5  rDev -17%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Shared a 750ml bottle at DLD with friends. Opened up a 375ml since I vaguely remember it before. 
A- Pours brown in color, maybe hints of red almost ruby depending on the light. Very little head to speak of though.
S- Very strong notes of vinegar, tartness. Tough to get much else through it. Maybe hints of cherry, but very little. 
T- Follows the nose pretty close. Lots of tart, brett, sourness up front and throughout. There is maybe some fruit, cherry taste sprinkled in. The tartness dominates the other flavors though.
M- Medium body, low carbonation. Very acidic and works over your throat.
O- Lots of sourness. The one I had a DLD didn't seem to be as sour, but has some age on it. Wouldn't be able to drink another bottle of this in the same night. Always fascinated with sours like this, try to pull out more flavors, this one was tough to do though. 866 charactersHosP, May 23, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5A: Garnet red body with a bubbly head. No lasting head or lacing which speaks for the high ABV. 
S: Obviously a sour and funky aroma with notes of currants, light oak, and cherries. Has a strong vinous quality to it.
T: Mouth puckering flavor. Flavors of cherries, white grapes, oak, brett, vinegar, a some currants. Very dry finish.
M: Very tannic mouthfeel; nice & bubbly carbornation; light to medium body.
O: I've been slowly getting myself into sour beers and this one was a nice one. Great representative of the style, but a sipper nonetheless. I can only handle one bottle at a time. More mild then some of the sours I've had which made this one more enjoyable for me. 679 charactersBrewCrew2010, May 21, 2011

A: This poured a hazy dark copper with almost no head.
S: It smelled like musky oak and sweet currants and prunes, with some sour white grapes and wild yeast.
T: It tasted like puckering sour and tart currant and black cherry, with some wild yeast and sweet raisin and musky oak. It had a lasting clean and sour/tart aftertaste.
M: It was oily and slick with lots of natural carbonation. Very nice body.
D: This was a highly complex beer that was delicate but powerful. The scent and taste and body were all awesome. It wasn't overly puckering either, and the alcohol was undetectable (scary!), so this was very inviting to continue drinking. Could be aged for a long time, but very nice fresh. An excellent sipping wild ale, which I might enjoy over other Russian Rivers due to it's depth and balance. 814 charactersPencible, May 19, 2011

A- Poured an opaque dark brown with ruby highlights with no head, but tiny carbonation bubbles around the top. 
S- The aroma was very strong of a cabernet, it was pretty surprising at first, I did not expect the cabernet aroma to be some prominent. Also a nice sweet cherry aroma 
T- Strong cabernet taste, strong very sour cherry taste, and dark fruit, and vinegar acidic notes 
M- High acidity and very high carbonation, my tongue was in heaven
O- This beer is unlike anything I have had before. The wine characteristics were so prominent and the sourness and acidity of the beer made this a very tasty and memorable beer. This is the first beer my wife has ever enjoyed too, so I was pretty impressed. 767 charactersHoptometrist, May 19, 2011

4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375ml bottle, Batch 5. It was acquired in a recent trade with BrewerB, thanks again Brian! This beer pours a fig like brown with reddish/purple highlights and an off white head that laces the glass. It smells of tart cherries, currants, grape skins, and moderate brett funk. It tastes sour cherries, tree bark, tannins, brett, and light alcohol. It drinks medium in body for a wild with a moderate amount of alcohol, but for 10% it is well hidden. It has a sharp, dry finish. Overall this is definitely a fine beer but certainly not the best I've had to date. 559 charactersaasher, May 17, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 5
served chilled into bruery tulip.
Color: A deep mahogany with shades maroon at the core. Forms a clear bubbly head that disappears quickly. No visual lacing left behind.
Nose: Sourness form the brett and other wild yeast and bacteria used to brew this beer. Dark cherries are evident along side the currants and faint tobacco. Oakiness creeps up toward the end.
Palate: Nicely carbonated makes for an easy drink. The abv is well masked through the beer, hardly noticeable. The dark cherry coat the tongue followed by little waves of oak and tobacco. The currants are not very evident here.
Finish: Long and a tad dry. Crisp with oak and cherry. Complex and drinkable, really well crafted beer with the right amount of sourness.
Rating: 94 out of 100. Not as good as Supplication or Temptation, but extremely solid. 827 charactersschmoopsbeer, May 16, 2011

A: Dark reddish brown with a very bubbly off white head that dies quick to nothing. Plenty of carbonation evident. 
S: Acidic lactic aroma with the bitter currants definitely featured. Some plums and cherries in there, the oak and wood tannins also poke through. Dark sour smell that we all love from Russian River. 
T/F: Classic Dry Russian River Sour in Feel and Taste. Buttery oak, dark fruit, and sour lactic notes that make for a bitter back of the palate and a semi sour feel over all, not as much as I expected actually. A well carbonated medium feel and a taste thats lacking too much complexity or sweetness, but is definitely good.
O: Not my favorite from Russian River, but a nice beer overall still! 762 charactersDreadnaught33, May 15, 2011

Batch 005x2F
Glowing deep amber colored body. Clear and free of sediment. Two finger antique white head is set atop. The head recedes rather quickly, slight ring left around the top. Very visible carbonation.
Very pleasant aroma. Currant, vinous aroma is rather prominent. The sweet aroma up front really balances out the sour vinegar like twang. 
The flavor has an unexpected balance. The BSDA base is much more evident than what I would have imagined. Cracker malt, fig and tobacco flavors lie under the tart fruity bite. The sour flavor is biting up front but smooth out as the beer moves towards the back of the palate. 
Medium bodied though lighter on the tongue. The carbonation is moderately high. The finish is quite dry and pleasant. Slight linger fruity tartness left lingering on the tongue.
Excellent beer. Flavors are a bit more layered than what I expected, retains the flavor of the base beer quite well. The higher Alcohol is well hidden, the 10% abv is barely noticed. This is just another reason I wish I had access to Russian River. Outstanding beer from a world class brewery. 1,142 characterskzoobrew, May 14, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review adapted from notes taken 10/19/10
Appearance: A rich amber brown color with a small beige head that turns into great lacing
Smell: Complex, to say the least - sour, funky, oak, hints of red wine and vinegar - a lot of strange smells at once but they work together very harmoniously
Taste: Remarkably, wonderfully sour - tart, with an interesting sharp level of funk - some fruits like cherries, figs, grapes - some dark fruit bitterness - consistently puckering - some malts in here, too - tastes more dark and cooked than some other sours I have encountered, which really sets this apart
Mouthfeel: I described this as "elegant and luxurious" and I stand by that - a medium body with some carbonation, super smooth
Overall: Another win for Russian River
This beer is fantastic. It shares some qualities with the other sours I have had (Temptation, Sanctification), but it has its own personality. It is a bit on the dark side, and I highly approve.
Update: 9/15/12
Another bottle... And this beer is magic. Just, magic. Dear Russian River: I love you.
Update: 11/10/13
Drinking batch 001x4. This is like a whole new beast. And it's amazing. I'm tempted to upgrade my ratings here (which are already stellar), but I guess that's not fair. This is the definition of epic. 1,287 charactersangrybabboon, May 14, 2011
3.92/5  rDev -11.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Batch 005x2E poured into a chimay chalice.
Nice pop when the cork is released. Pour is quite lively, sort of the opposite of a big thick stout. Absolutely no head at all on this. A bit disconcerting but seems like it's not unusual. Carbonation is soda pop high. Color also is light brown soda. Quite light, almost orange when held to light. Fairly clear, the sediment has settled nicely at the bottom of the bottle. 
Aroma has a nice mix of sour and sweet. Green apple cider, candy sweet tarts (yes, my vocabulary for describing this style is quite limited). 
Very dry tart flavor. Not sour as such. Cider comes to mind again. Quite nice but not what I was expecting. 
Mouthfeel is very light and makes this easily drinkable. And the abv is completely hidden almost to the point that I would BS. Not in any way does this present like a 10% beer.
A bit disappointing and one dimensional after Supplication. Not sure if there is a recommended drinking temp for this style but a bit more sour kick comes through as it warms and it gets more of an overall presence which helps define the beer. Would like to try another bottle some day as this ones now gone. Enjoyable but didnt leave much of an impression. 1,208 charactersjoecast, May 13, 2011

Appearance: Its a beautifully clear reddish-brown beer. There was some off white head initially with a hard pour, but it faded to nothingness in seconds. As it sits, its still, but attractive.
Smell: Sour and vinous. Dry cab sav aromas (currants and oak). Sour cherries and leather. Musty and with a touch of balsamic. 
Taste: Quite sour and tannic, but neither quite cause a pucker. Sour fruit, dirty basement, and sweaty saddle. The cab sav is very assertive, but not overbearing in the way I found the pinot in Supplication. From the middle through the finish, echoes of the base beer-- maltiness and some phenolic spiciness-- are tasted. Finishes very dry.
Mouthfeel: Low level of carbonation. Sticky dry tannins on the tongue, like you expect with cab sav.
Drinkability: A delicious and complex sipper. The sour is assertive, but not overbearing, as is the wine flavor. As I said before, I thought Supplication was to wine-y, this one is just right. 1,044 charactersrapidsequence, May 12, 2011

Pours brown with glowing amber tones around the edges. Poured aggressively and received nothing but a few bubbles. No head whatsoever, and also left no lacing.
Smell is of a tart berries. I can't really pick up anything else but it's still very nice even though it's lacking complexity.
Taste is of fig and sour sour berries. Again? Lacking in complexity but very enjoyable nonetheless.
Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. The Brett is definitely present, but not puckering. That's exactly how I like my sours. Also leaves a lingering tingle on the back of your tongue. Very nice.
Yet again a solid offering from RR! 651 charactersDearthVader, May 11, 2011

This is meant to be a valid criticism of this beer. This is a back to back tasting of Consecration and Supplication. 
I openly challenge anyone and everyone to do a blind tasting of these beers. They are interesting in their own way, but all I see them as is a vessel to deliver the bitter strain of yeast that they have in common. This beer is nothing more than sour, you cannot taste the currants or anything. RR Cornered the DIPA.TIPA market with the Pliny's and is in search of a new thing, unfortunately it does not deliver. These beers are nothing more than sour. 628 charactersalexhahn82, May 08, 2011

Pours a dark amber with beautiful amber hues when held to the light. Head dissipates quickly leaving no lacing at all.
Smells wonderfully tart with berries and funk, I like it but it lacks complexity.
Taste is absolutely mouthwatering. The sour funk has a wonderful balance with the sweet berries and tobacco musk. I have trouble enjoying sours but this is very exceptional and I really do enjoy this brew.
Mouthfeel is light in weight and has an awesome tingle that dances down the tongue leaving a resin aftertaste of tobacco.

Taste definitely follows the nose, with strong fruitiness and vinegar tartness. Too much brett... Hints of cherries and currants, but mostly vinegar. Alcohol noticeable, but not strong at all. 
Highly acidic feel, with some carbonation. Not too smooth, but that's a sour for you.
After all the hype, including the price, I was unimpressed. I was expecting an eye-opening sour experience, and I got what I consider an average experience. Maybe some more aging would have improved it; I don't know. Just underwhelming all around. 673 charactersAiryk12, May 04, 2011

Taste: Great sour character. Initial blast of lemon tartness. Deep cherry, some Pinot Noir notes, okak, and lively vinegar. Great flavor profile. 
Mouth: Puckeringly tart. The alcohol is well hidden and allows the fine currant flavor and dry puckering to come through. 
Drink and Overall: I gotta knock the appearance for lack of carbonation. I expected a little more head, and therefore more nose. It was wonderful, but I will update if I taste again with different reaults. 786 charactersMarcatGSB, May 03, 2011

A - Dark brown body with some ruby highlights...it's alive...the carbonation is crazy in this one...some sediment is suspended and floating around...the head was small and white and didn't stick around for long...with a swirl it comes back but vanishes just as quickly...all that's left is a small bead around the top
S - You can smell that this one is going to be tart...it's very fruity with tart cherries, grapes, raisins, and currants...the grapes bring out a very pronounced winey characteristics...not many woody aromas
T - There's the tartness I was waiting for...full on tart and sourness that makes you pucker up nicely...the currants really blend in nicely (I actually tried a dried currant along side the beer because I did not know what they tasted like)...again the tartness comes back...the finish is wine like and flavored with currants
M - Medium bodied...tart with dark fruits (currants, grapes)...nice carbonation
D - I was happy to finally try a beer from Russian River...and I'm starting to get used to trying wild ales...the tartness level in this one was apparent from the first sniff and very apparent as you swallow...I liked trying a dried currant along side because it really helped me pinpoint the currant flavor in the beer...again, a big thanks to Deuane for sharing this one with me 1,357 charactersthain709, May 01, 2011

Picked this one up in Colorado the previous summer and have been waiting patiently to crack it since. It survived its cage almost getting blown off due to elevation change and an accidental freeze in the fridge...let's see what's in the bottle
A - pours a brownish red with a small head with a ton of bubbling carbonation. More of a deep red with shades of brown.
S - smells of vinegar, sour notes, a bit of brett funk...sour smelling overall
T - starts off with sour notes of lemon that pucker and lock up your mouth. The sourness is cut into by acidic vinegar tones which helped bring down the sourness. On the exhale you can taste the sour flavors and a lot of vinous oak-soaked cab notes on the finish...this taste lingered far down the palate, almost like I washed down my drink with some cab. A bit of brett funk and mushroom hung over everything but it was hard to tell exactly when on the palate it came in. Really nice complexity.
M - Really nice carbonation and good body to it
D - This beer showcases to me why RR is considered one of the top, if not the top, wild ale producer in North America. Really nice complexity that makes this stand out from some of the other sours / wilds I have tried. I am going to have to get some more of this one for sure. 1,282 charactersbirchstick, May 01, 2011

This is a beautiful beer. It's a deep garnet red with just a wisp of head that quickly dissipates like soda bubbles. The effervescence carries a lot wine notes: black peppery, damp oak, crushed and blackberries, with just a whiff of earthy funk. The acid and alcohol and definitely present in the nose and on the palette. The wine notes dominate, with big fruitiness, leather, tobacco, and a dry tannic oak finish . The currants add a bit of jammy, creamy fruit. The finish is boozy with just a slightly tart and minerally finish. There is a bit of lingering funk that coats your tongue. Very tasty and complex.

Corked and Caged 375mL bottle into a Cigar City snifter
A- Pours a beautiful dark ruby red with a nice 1 finger white head that almost immediately disappears. No lacing to speak of either. A great looking beer.
S- A fantastic sour funk that makes way to the dark fruits and old leather as it warms in the glass. Reminds me of a nice red wine.
T- Great tartness up front with grapes, a hint of currants, sweet acidity, kind of like a sugar covered lemon, and a great sour back end. Very enjoyable.
M- Perfectly carbonated with a nice dry finish. Slightly thin, but in a good way that doesn't overpower the more defining parts of this beer.
O- Very impressed. This being my first Russian River wild ale, I was expecting a great funky beer and came away with just that. A perfect send off beer for my best friend, Emmaus217. Good luck man. 1,005 charactersJoshVandy, Apr 26, 2011

O: Excellent sour. I prefer the supplication series, but this is a close second from RR. Good job again Vin. 627 charactersharrymel, Apr 25, 2011

A: Pours a clear dark red with thin tan head that dissipates seconds after being poured leaving no film or lacing around glass.
S: Sweet and sour with dark fruit, brett funk, a hint of oak and some alcohol. Smells similar to a red wine with some funk, sourness and spice from the currants.
T: Sweet dark fruit with some lacto sourness, barnyardy funk and a touch of oak. I can really taste the currants much more than I picked up in the aroma. The sour wine aroma in the nose doesn't really carry over to the taste, this is definitely a sour ale from start to finish.
M: The light carbonation is amplified by the tingling acidic sourness on my tongue. Nice smooth medium body finishes on the dry side and leaves fruit and spice flavors lingering in my mouth.
O: Solid sour ale, tastes great but I would drink a Supplication over this any day. The currants add a nice unique flavor to compliment the sourness and sweet fruit. Drinks really well for a 10% ABV ale, the alcohol is barely noticeable. 1,100 charactersAzurescens, Apr 24, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch-005X2E
A - Pours a dark ruby brown color with an off-white head.
S - Red wine comes out strong along with lots of clean wood. Dried cherries, musty old church-like funk.
T - Sweet/sour cherries, tart raspberry quickly overtakes any sweetness with a lactic acidic bite. Malty sweetness barely bleeds through with notes of faint cocoa. The finish is a sensation of having plum/grape skins on your tongue along with a sharp punch of acidic sour right at the end.
M - Low prickly carbonation, thin body.
Wine and wood are strong components. Sharp and sour with lots of tart fruit character and was nice to have some good funk in there as well.
This would go great with grilled goat cheese filled mushrooms. 714 charactersStaveHooks, Apr 22, 2011
3.58/5  rDev -18.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5This pours out as a pretty nice wine like Amber Red color. The head vanishes quickly after the pour and just leaves a thing white film on top of the beer. The smell is super tart smelling, very acidic like vinegar. The taste is of sour cherry and stomach acid similar to a Geuze Lambic. The after taste leaves a dry mouthfeel in the back of your tongue. It makes you want another sip but since I'm not into this style too much it's almost unwanted. The mouthfeel is similar to a red wine in my opinion. It's an awesome beer for those who like the Wild Sour Ales but it's just not for me. 587 charactersKnapp85, Apr 22, 2011
4.11/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Dark cherry amber body. Small fizzy off white head fades rather quickly to a thin ring lace. 
Aroma: funky bread, wet leather, some nuttiness, and currant. Very musty. Tobacco. Hint of vinegar. The mustiness and tobacco are a little too potent IMO. I don't particulary like them especially at this level. After tasting the beer, the aroma becomes more pleasing.
Taste: sweet cherry/plum upfront followed immediately by a strong sour tang. Although the sour is strong, it takes a backseat to the sweet dark fruit flavors. Finishes very dry with the lingering taste of bitter apple skins on the back of the tongue. Exceptionally complex.
Mouthfeel: bright and airy. Very champaign like.
Drinkability is extremely high for such a high alcohol beer. This is 10% and if you like sour beers, you can really pound this stuff. It might be a good thing that it's expensive.
Drink it at cellar temperature or even almost room temperature, - the beer opens up and more sweetness shows rather than the sour. Complexity improves the drinkability as you want to keep drinking to simply figure out what it is you are tasting. The dryness also contributes to this great drinkability.
One of the top wild ales in the world. I like some of the other russian river wilds better (i.e Supplication, Compunction), but this one is still very good. 1,342 characterspalma, Apr 21, 2011

Poured into a RR Belgian chalice glass (seemed fitting?). Garnet body with a fizzy offwhite head that rapidly fizzy away quickly. Aroma is filled with oak & red wine notes; cherries, plums, grapes. Very barnyard-like funky aroma. Flavor is bracingly sour, funky, and oaky. The sweet fruity characteristics really shine in the flavor as well. Finishes bone dry with a mouthwatering astringency. Bubbly/prickly on the tongue with a rather light body. To top everything off, the alcohol is extremely well hidden, making this one incredibly drinkable brew. Russian River knows how to make beer. 604 charactersmuttyd, Apr 20, 2011

No head off the slow pour, what little there was, was a light tan brown that quickly faded and left the smallest of all collars. Body color is a gorgeous dark red and brown cherry, very wine like looking. 
A nice simple tartyness that isn't overpoweringly sour. Cherry like fruit sensation. Not even any heat really coming off for this high abv. Standard funky barnyard to go with it, musty and dank, slightly dry. No sense of oak from this at all.
Classic tart and viscous sour, but sort of boring. Sour cherries also. Almost red wine vinegar but not quite. Sort of one dimensional. Fairly alright for mouthfeel light bodied, warming in the stomach, and coating snap feeling mid palate with some spice. Strangely I get a feeling for summer sausage when having this beer. I want paprika with this.
Overall alright but sort of pedestrian. Feels like a food beer than for casual drinking for me. It will do. 998 characterssmakawhat, Apr 15, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -5.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours out a medium amber color with about a finger of off-white head forms that has pretty average retention and minimal lacing. Some carbonation is present, but not a whole lot.
Smell: Funk and mustiness are present, but not real strongly. A bit of sourness as well, and quite a bit of oak, along with some darker fruit character; possibly plum and/or currant.
Taste: The plums and currants come out first, followed by strong mustiness and acidity. Out of Temptation, Supplication and Consecration, this beer is assuredly the most sour. A definite lactic sourness noted that is biting, and combines with the oak character very nicely. This is absolutely the highlight of this beer.
Mouthfeel: This beer is definitely medium bodied, but is lacking a bit of carbonation for my taste. Fairly low for the style, but still good. Overall, a good wild ale that really satisfies if you're looking for something sour. I wish the other aspects of this beer were as good as the taste, because it is good. 1,009 characterszhanson88, Apr 11, 2011

Pours a nice dark rubyish color, with only a little head. Smell is sweet and sour, and in a little way, quite wonderful. Maybe some dark grapes, maybe a little cherry.
Taste is very tart, a little plummy, a little dark bitterness in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is thin, a little filmy. Overall, I'm enjoying this more than the Sanctification in the other glass. 407 characterssnaotheus, Apr 11, 2011

Appearance: Poured into an oversize red wine glass, pours red-brown with a thin head that disappears quickly. Using a headlamp to give it some backlight reveals a steady stream of bubbles rising to the top
Smell: Leather funk, and like spontaneously fermenting raspberries.
Taste: Like it smells, tart on the back of the tongue, caramel sweetness. I've had barrel aged beer and brett soured beer before, but never together, and this is nothing like I've tasted in either case. Its complexity changes as it warms to room temperature; the currant flavors come out more and the sourness is much more pronounced. it develops a creamy softness that balances out the flavors. the 10% alcohol is completely masked by the other flavors and textures. has a very long finish that tastes like a full bodied cabernet. the finish is complimented by a well aged asiago and a single sip of Islay single matl scotch
Mouthfeel: the carbonation tickles the tongue almost as much as the sourness.
as a whole this beer is amazing, will probably drink again as a special occasion. 1,148 charactersmessyhair42, Apr 10, 2011

Once at GABF, and twice at home with some bottles I was able to find while out there. The beer at first is unassuming. It pours a cloudy, hazy, mahogany with a small, tiny head. Then you smell it. Smell is oaked funk. Very sour, with a sufficiently huge aroma. First taste is an explosion on the tongue, with a huge sour note exploding outwards midway through the first taste. Wow. That's really all I can say. Must be tasted to be believed. The standard bearer for sour beers. . Pliny gets all the press but this beer deserves all the accolades - and more. Most assuredly up there with my favorites of all time. 679 characterseclaycamp, Apr 09, 2011

S. Big red wine smell, sour grapes pucker my mouth before I even taste (I'm a sour greenhorn) in anticipation.Definately picking up the oak in the nose,And A bit of the alchohol.
T. At first very sour and dry! I can't explain to much I do get some of that barn yard smell along with sour grapes. What I like best is it mellows out in the end with the oak.
M. Medium feel is nice. prickly carbonation stings the pallet. 
Overall this is only my second sour ever and I enjoyed it quit a bit.I have another in the celler, interested to see what age does to it.Try this if you have not tried it yet. 882 charactersMarty30, Apr 08, 2011

Appearance: Pours an opaque reddish brown color with a layer of off white head that goes away completely.
Smell: Sour fruity vinegar with a hint of sweetness. I'd say it is very wine like.
Taste: Just like the smell, I'm picking up sour fruit and vinegar notes, but much smoother here than in the smell. I can taste oak, and red wine. All the flavors are in perfect balance. The finish is warm from the alcohol, very nice.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with tingly mild carbonation. The finish is dry and woody.
Overall: I haven't found a sour beer that I like better than this one. The flavors are so well balanced, and the alcohol isn't anywhere to be found. Very smooth. 773 charactersoline73, Apr 02, 2011

A: Pours a very dark brown with a cherry hue. The head is ivory to tan colored, and leaves a thick lacing on the walls of my glass.
S: Funk up front, leaning towards barnyard, not much leather. The signature 'Tion aroma follows the funk. The currant and raisins wrap up the nose and give it a nice balance.
T: The funk and sour are muted compared to the nose. There fruit flavors are muted a little, but what has seemed to have faded the most over time is the funkiness. More recent batches have a more pronounced flavor.
M: Medium bodied, with nice prickly carbonation, and a lingering sourness.
D: This is a great beer, but not as good as fresher batches, IMO. 696 charactersaglose45, Apr 02, 2011

Poured into a New Belgium Tulip.
A - Pours a crystal clear Mahogany with a very small off white head that vanishes into a fine ring that follows the glass down.
S - I am getting some Brett funk, leather, barnyard, some dark fruit, figs, plum, and a touch of oak.
T - Sour, Tart, Puckering Tart, oakey, and fruity in that order. Sourness starts off on first sip, followed by a nice tartness that increases until it puckers you. Then some of the oak is shining through followed by the dark fruit. Simply amazing. An incredible showcase of flavors.
M - On firt glance your thinking full bodied, but this is really light on the tounge. Very deceiving on carbonation. The sourness makes you feel like it has alot of carbonic bite, when in reality it is very lightly carbed.
O - This is the best sour I have ever had. The complexity is overwhelming. This is so masterfully crafted that it rivals the finest Bordeaux blends. This should be on every beer lovers bucket list. 984 charactersavaccani, Apr 02, 2011

Appearance - Much darker than the other Russian Rivers I've had. No head or froth upon pouring at all. The carbonation is hard to judge on this. Overall, an opaque deep red and brown color. Looks quite sweet and honestly a little flat.
Smell - A little sweeter side to the traditional sour smell of Russian River beers. Some light cherry and perhaps some other fruits as well. Light lemon in the distance. Definitely a heavy oak flavor all-throughout.
Taste - Sour and tart on the front. I immediately notice the translation of light cherries from nose to mouth. A fairly heavy lemon zest throughout; while retaining a certain amount of sweet fruit.The power of the lemon, ethanol, and carbonation are perhaps a little to much and cause some sort of upset in my throat. I very oddly taste chocolate in my mouth after the finish.
Mouthfeel / Drinkability - My initial response after my first drink was that this was a heavy-bodied beer. But it soon mellowed out to be pretty average-medium bodied. Sour and tart with a hint of sweetness. Heavy carbonation becomes clear upon my first drink. Slight sourness left on the lips. Nice to sip and enjoy. Ethanol is hidden quite well but stands out at times. I think I would prefer sanctification over this one. 1,372 charactersJesse13713, Apr 01, 2011

A: Bubbly white head grows initially, but disappears instantly. Nothing left after more than a few second and no lacing. Very dark red, almost brown pour. 3.5
S: Lots of oak, cherries, and a bit of sourness in the smell. Tart currants are dominant, some sweetness underneath.
T: The taste is pretty tart up front, cherries or currants I guess. Lots of oakiness and a bit sour. The sourness isn't dominate, but present.
MF: Light with a nice amount of carbonation. Hardly any hint of alcohol.
O: I didn't mind this one. I've had a couple of sours in a row I really didn't like, but this wasn't bad.
December 31, 2011: Batch 004X1. Figured I'd give this another try as I'm starting to really like sours now.
A: The beer pours a very deep red, almost amber, with a fizzy off white head. Absolutely no lacing or retention, and only a few bubbles float up the side of my Russian River -tion snifter. The color really impresses me, hence the increase in rating. 4
S: The smell is really sour and oaky. Booze and currants lay underneath. The fruit really does a good job of providing a sweetness to balance the sourness, but still sits second. 4
T: Huge increase here. I understand the reason this is so highly regarded. Big fruit, big sour, ton of funk, oak, booze, all balanced wonderfully, just barely on the sour side. The fruits are tart cherries and currants, which really come out in the middle. Sour up fruit and an oaky booze at the end. Tart finish. 4.5
MF: Medium body, low carbonation, very tart on the palate throughout. 4
O: This was wonderful. Very glad I tried it again. 4.5 1,665 charactersrusswbeck, Mar 30, 2011

A: Pours a rich dark brown similar to a dark scotch or whisky with no head whatsoever. Lacing is lean if at all. Reminds me of a glass filled with a spirit.
S: Intense tart and sour notes. Currents are dominate for main flavor but oak is present as well. Touch of sweetness similar to vanilla pop up here and there but overall this is a very sour beer.
T: Clean and balanced but still quite tart and sour. Big sour and tart notes hit the palate up front with current as the fruit. Current is very dominate but the entire flavor is clean and balanced with just a touch of oak and wood. 
M: Full bodied and clings to the palate, front to back, from start to finish. There is zero carbonation, the bite from this beer comes from the sour affects of yeast and barrel aging.
D: This is an amazing sour. The barrel aging in Cabernet barrels with currents truly gives you a puckering affect that's sour and tart from start to finish. This isn't over done on sour instead is incredibly balanced for how intense and big this beer is. 1,084 charactersnotyourdadsbeer, Mar 29, 2011

An "extra" from walows, thanks man, been wanting to try this one for a while
This is my first RR sour. Been fortunate to try Pliny and Damnation and, not that they need my approval, have come away impressed. 
Pours deep raisin with a touch of ruby. A 1 cm head quickly comes and goes and leaves no trace. 
You can smell the acidity that awaits, not much hint of fruit and instead a healthy dose of barnyard
tart, like a cherry with all of the sugar removed. You can tell there has been fruit there, but I couldn't have told you currants. Very enjoyable overall but I have been on a major sour kick
nice mouthfeel and not overly carbonated. 
I could drink this one again; RR is more of a pain to get and I have a supplication, temptation, and sanctification waiting in the wings. It will be interesting to compare this "more commonly" available RR sour to a couple that tend to be a little more hard to get (especially to me) 975 charactersCruisaC, Mar 28, 2011

It pours a rather nice looking grape juice colored reddish purple color with a fairly small off white head with no lacing. Smells of black currants, cherry, horse blanket, and a little funk.

S-Tart cherry/blackcurrant acidity, reminiscent of a good lambic. Moderately funky aromas of brett/horse blanket.
T/M-Age has been kind to this one. The intensely tart fruit flavors have held up for the most part. Strong flavors of balsamic reduction and maraschino cherries. The finish is aggressively tart, with a hint of brown sugar.

Taste: Very complex, this beer tastes great it gives off lots of tannins. The taste of Cabernet Sauvignon is very prevalent in this beer.
Drinkability: Highly drinkable. This beer is sour but not extremely sour, the 10% ABV had me apprehensive on how this beer would taste but this is as drinkable, and perhaps even more so than the Supplication.

4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 001x1. Bottled 12/24/2008. Glazed brick red with an orange juice infusion and polished persimmon highlights. The khaki colored crown is crackly and unsticky, which is frequently the case with barrel-aged ale that is also hop-deficient. Despite a spic-n-span chalice, the liquid itself is a lovely hue.
It's difficult to appreciate the BSDA-like qualities or the currants. On second sniff, dark malts and medium-dark fruit isn't quite buried beneath the bugs... which include two yeasts (Abbey Ale and Brettanomyces) as well as two bacteria (Lactobacillus and Pediococcus). American wild ale is the perfect style choice according to the nose.
Consecration comes through where it matters most and is yet another inspired creation from the mind and hands of Mr. Cilurzo. Whatever complexity was lacking in the nose has been found on the palate. Truthfully, the aroma is improving by leaps and bounds as time goes by.
The best thing is that the base BSDA does a wonderful job sticking up for itself under the onslaught of tangy funkitude from the wee critters. There are fig and tobacco qualities that supercede the currants. Breadth, depth and complexity is a hallmark of Russian River beer. Alcohol masking is ridiculously seamless.
This already amazing ale might have been even better with more malt and darker malts. In other words, a funk-accented BSDA rather than a BSDA-accented American wild ale. Yeah, that's probably nothing more than my style preferences talking. It's impossible to argue with what has soaked into my taste buds so far.
The mouthfeel has almost certainly taken a hit in the more than two years since bottling. That said, it manages a hint of viscosity in the second half of each mouthful. Lush and creamy and expansive isn't in the cards at this point... if it was ever present.
Consecration (noun): the act of dedication to the worship and service of a deity. It would be blasphemy to suggest that Vinnie is a deity, so how about craft brewing god? Bottom line: this outstanding elixir is another in a long line of outstanding -tion beer from one of the best breweries in this, or any, country. 2,131 charactersBuckeyeNation, Mar 14, 2011

From the same BA trade that got me the Lost Abbey Witches Wit, as well as the Lost Abbey Cuvee De Tomme that I'm sitting on even longer. It's been sitting in the fridge for about six weeks, and I can't wait any longer. Away we go!
Dark plum-red coloration, with no head at all, starts slightly fizzy, then quits quickly.
Aroma: ah, that's the stuff, there's the brett, that funky wild wicked twisted sour and sassy wine-ish nose. Currants are doing plenty of work here, too, it's fresh with the fruit. Lovely, lovely stuff. 
Tasting it: Whoa! Grabs the tongue and pins it down. Puckeration all the way, in this. Does not relent with the intense tartness. Fruit flavor gives some relief, squeezing in between the huge tart bite. 
Another sip, another gulp, and in rushes cherries, blackberries, grapes, some sweet, and then sour. grips the tongue, spanks it a bit, slathers it up and down with funk and sour. Luxurious, relaxing, lush and wonderful.
Halfway in, it's getting deep, plummier, richer...moreover. I'm more impressed-er, for sure. Deeee-licious. Mmmm. Mmm. Mm. M. 1,122 charactersfeloniousmonk, Mar 10, 2011

A: Nice dark amber color. Leaves a ring of white head
S: Nose is basically a fruit medley. Grape, strawberry, cherry. Some funk. Some tartness from the fruit. I might even detect some currant
T: Sour right up front. Dry fruit follows once you get accustomed to the tartness. A bit of sweetness gets through, but definitely hindered by funk
M: Medium. After a few sips the sourness died down a bit, but still very present. Dry, wine-like finish
D: Definitely a great sour. A bit drier then most. I think I prefer Supplication though due to a bigger fruit presence 727 charactersBrez07, Mar 09, 2011

A: Very clear. The color is interesting, its like a dark mahogany and when held up to the light it takes on a reddish orange hue. Lots of tiny bubbles rushing to the surface, almost like a chute of champagne. Head was disappeared as fast as it arrived and leaves little lacing.
S: Wow. I've never smelt a beer like this. Its got that barnyard smell typically found in aged old world wines, along with tobacco, molasses, and currants... the weird part is this hint of sweetness...like cherries floating around in the background. I was an oenophile well before getting to really appreciate beer and most wines can't even match this smell in complexity. Whatever barrels they used really left their mark.
T: So much going on. Its got that wine character - molasses, tobacco, barnyard at first, which is overwhelmed by this super tart but at the same time subtly sweet... the sweet flashes and disappears leaving a long puckering tart that sits on the palate until the wine character reemerges and stays with you for some time. Really didnt notice the 10% abv at all. 
M: Has a light to medium champagney body to it, not as much carbonation as I thought when first poured and the carb it has at first continues to dissipate as you drink it. Its not bad at all. 
D: As good as it is, i dont know how many id want to drink. Not to take away from the beer, but this is one of those that are probably most appreciated when served with food, not to be consumed in quantity. This beer bitch slapped my brain, id have a headache if i had another. 1,576 charactersMurphdog82, Mar 04, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a tulip, the beer pours a deep, dark amber color that appears to be clear, and starts with an inch of bubbly head that quickly vanishes down to nothing. The beer smell is an uncanny comparison to a light merlot. The currants are definitely apparent when you raise the glass to your nose. The beer has good carbonation throughout drinking, which helps to keep the heavy flavors light in mouth. The beer is sour on the tip of the tongue, and continues down the tongue, almost puckering at points. Dark fruit flavors abound throughout the mouth, with a slight peppery spice every once in a while. Very tasty, and again, the lightness and crispness provided by the steady carbonation make this a nice, smooth drink. The beer leaves a sour grape-type flavor in the mouth after each sip, but light. The sour aftertaste and the lingering finish pucker the mouth a bit, and it begs for another sip. Delicious! 927 charactersGarthDanielson, Mar 03, 2011
3.95/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4poured from a not full liter growler into a duvel tulip.
I got this ale, what, 4 days ago. I was a little disappointed that the tender left about an inch of air, but fortunate enough to get a growler of this delicious liquid (how do you spell beverege?).
Pours a deep purplish red. I poured from a height to revitalize some carbonation, though the ceramic plug Did give a nice pop. The off white foam disappeared almost immediately.
Smells like wine vinegar, slight dill, maybe a tinge of cranberry or some tart red berry.
The mouthfeel is soft across the palate and coats the lips like a soft red wine. Theres the dill again and sourness that gives way to more of the cranberry/currant tones. Theres a bit of sugar that I can actually feel light up endorfins, but the ale finishes somewhat dry. Makes the saliva glands leak with the sourness. 847 charactersmtwentz, Mar 01, 2011

Pours a deep reddish-orange-brown color with a small off-white head that dissipates, although there is some visible carbonation throughout. Aroma of sour lemon, tart cherries and other dark fruits (must be the currants), oak, vanilla, and some funk. Flavor of tart cherries and currants, sour lemon, tart apples, oak, vanilla, funk, and a hint of vinegar. The ABV is well masked here. Medium-bodied, with a sour mouthfeel and mellow carbonation. Complex, well-balanced, and interesting. I am not a big fan of sours, but am glad to have tried this one as well as the other RR sours! 634 charactersCuriousMonk, Feb 28, 2011

A: A deep reddish brown with no head at all. Decent.
S: Smells of some very tart cherries upfront with a bit of bready rye and energy drink. Some very faint apple on the backend. Good.
T: Hmm, a nice tart cherry blended well with some sugary malts. A very nice blend here, not too over-sour. An earthy breadiness to this one in the middle with some energy drink hints on the backend. Good.
M: Full body with a great carbonation. Finishes with a tartness. Good.
D: For a sour, this is so well blended. Not really overpowering in any area. Very good.
All in all, this one definitely did surprise. This definitely is tart, but is so well blended that it makes this easy to drink. If you like sours, this will be like the holy grail of well blended sours. If you're looking for the most puckering brew around, this is not. It's puckering, but is so well blended. 992 characterssteve8robin, Feb 27, 2011

Reviewed this a couple months ago, got another bottle to give it another go. Pours a gorgeous dark brown, that shows hints of maroon and purple, and shows deep amber/mahogany in light. Head is ample, but so fizzy it's gone before I even finish pouring. Effervescent, as bubbles continuously rise, almost like pop. 
Very cleanly tart on the nose, but not too much so. It isn't harsh, but isn't soft tartness either. Sour cherries are the main fruit coming out of this one, along with a bit of barnyard funk. 
Taste starts relatively sour, smooths out with that funk, and finishes fruity and sour again. Assorted berries come through here, amongst them blackberries and cherries (they aren't berries, sue me), along with plenty of red wine fruity character. The finish also contains that wine similarity, as it has the depth and body of a deep red wine, but sours it up and adds fruit to the mix to sweeten (figuratively) the deal. 
Mouthfeel is surprisingly lacking much of the carbonation that was easily visible on the pour. I think it just leaves the drink before you know it. The beer is better for it though, as it drinks like a wine even more so. Drinkability is great: the beer has lots of strong flavors, yet I see the 10% abv and am perplexed. Finish is cleanly tart and nice, which sets up the next sip pretty well. This is even better than I remembered it. 1,392 charactersveinless, Feb 25, 2011

Hulmeville Tap, Poured into 10oz Goblet.
A- purple, maroon, dark, dark red. no head. just settlement. it sits in the glass, ready to unleash some fury. staring into it, it resembles a mystical well from a fairy tale; jump in.
S- pungent. initially, highly fermented prune, grape, fig, orange. alcohol tininess. the aroma is deep. put your nose right inside the glass and inhale greatly. the sourness of grapes and citrus, a little vanilla, dominate the deeper, nose-in-glass inhalation. medley of sharp fruit aromas.
T- acidic, tart fruit. very dominant combo of grape, cherry, and citrus, like an old fruit salad with orange zest. the alcohol is present throughout. though as a wild ale, alcohol presence is to be expected, however, the pure phenol flavor just isn't there; it's in the fruit, which is pleasant.
M- it has a great deal of carbonation, which is nice, but it seems to taste more of a fruit/veg beer in that carb body rather than having a thicker body like a gueze like i don't know why i expected; it's somewhere in-between the two.
D- the carbonation makes this pleasant and on-going-ly interesting. the flavors and aromas are really nice, and it's great to end with or sit-on for a while just staring, swirling, and smelling. but i don't think i could have more than one. maybe i could. 
consecration would be nice with some food--thai, indian, duck confit, gelato, chocolate?--actually, that sounds good. 1,447 characterspatm1986, Feb 24, 2011

Appearance: This pours a dark brown color with a hint of ruby at the edges. No carbonation apparent from no head - uh oh. 
Smell: Black currants, vinegar, with a nice oak barrel character. An obvious tart character accompanies a light raisin aroma. 
Taste: Sweet balsamic vinegar, black currants, and a rich oaky bite. Some dark fruit flavor complement. The finish is quite tart. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied for what I expect from a sour. Tart and puckering, with a little bit of residue on the tongue. Pretty flat, maybe I got a leaky bottle?
Drinkability: Something I definitely enjoy, and a change of pace from my normal hoppy beer. Sour and enjoyable. 703 charactersKickInTheChalice, Feb 22, 2011

A- Pours a cloudy yellow brown with a small, quickly dissipating head. 
S- Great aromas here. A mediocre amount of brett funk, and lost of red wine and oak. There is a very small presence of vinegar that is welcoming. 
T- The brett really shines through in the taste. The perfect amount of tart and no alcohol at all. Hints of oak and red wine again.
M- Perfectly dry and full. Medium carbonation. 
D- This is easily the most drinkable sour I have tried. There is no appearent alcohol and such wonderful flavor. 615 charactersgawnphishin, Feb 22, 2011

Draft to chimay goblet
App- A very dark amber with ruby highlights. No head on this one. Just a thin outlying ring of bubbles that was quick to dissapate.
Smell- Muted grape juice with a tinge of tartness. Has a small funk of some brett mixed with some hay.
Taste- Take some Welch's grape juice and mix a bunch of booze to it. This damn thing was smooth, tasty and pretty complex for my basic simile.
Mouth- Had a perfect medium body with a pretty high carb level for not having much head or bubbly activity.
Drink- Damn, I could drink this all day, fall off a bar stool and keep drinking some more. Was tastefully crafted with well blended flavors. 673 charactersFosterJM, Feb 20, 2011

Pours a slightly hazy brownish red color with a small white head. Scent is not nearly as sour or funky as I has remembered. It's actually very sweet smelling with some dark fruit aromas. Smells somewhat like a desert wine. I get a small hint of vinegar. Now here we go! The taste is like I remembered! There's that puckering sour taste I was lookin for! First I get some sweet dark fruit flavors...cherries and plums. Then I get a bit of vinegar flavor followed by delicious sour fruit. There is definitely some funk in the flavor and sweet wine notes. It finishes with amazing oak flavors and tartness. High alcohol is so well hidden that it's crazy. Delicious beer! Mouthfeel is very full and complex. Not syrupy and not as dry as other wild ales and sour beers I've had. Drinkability is high...as long as the ABV doesn't creep up. 905 charactersDovaliHops, Feb 18, 2011

375ml Bottle purchased at Whole Foods La Jolla, $12.50
I've had this beer on tap a few times but never in the bottle. Poured into a snifter.
A: Deep reddish purple, mostly penetrable by light. Pours with very little off-white head and no lacing to speak of.
S: When the cork popped off this gem, the aroma was intense with balsamic vinegar, plums, and red wine. The cab barrel aging is very evident.
T: Very sour with mild sweetness and oak. Possibly some fleshy fruit and clove flavors, certainly balsamic vinegar. The taste profile is very complex.
M: Medium body with moderate carbonation. So incredibly smooth and silky. Finishes with red wine but continues to hold the silky texture. Perfect.
D: This beer is perhaps a bit sour, alcoholic, and expensive to drink more than one or two. That being said, I would drink it all the time given the opportunity. I would consider pairing this with an aged or stinky cheese. It stands up to other strong flavors very well, pair accordingly. 1,014 charactersdmsohyea, Feb 16, 2011

Thanks to Forgetfu for this in a massive trade
A-- Poured a dark brown and settled dark black cherry color. Good amount of haze. No head at all. A little bit of off white film on the sides of the glass but not much else. on swirling the glass got some head but went bye quickly. 
S-- Sweet and sour. Very well balanced nose. Get Cherry, oak, straw, and barn. 
T-- Sweet to immediate massive sour cherry pucker. Cherry sweet tart on steroids. Or is that I mean Oak. Really like how it goes from sweet cherry to massive sour tart cherry and then Oak hits. 
M-- Lots of carbonation in the mouth but still a medium feel about it. Light in the front but gets heavier in the back. A lot of cherry or citrus acidity and cherry sourness in the back. Not that much cherry sweetness in the front but it is there. Can totally see where this is becoming a sour bomb as the sweet is seriously dropping off in this and the sour is taking over in this. 
D-- ABV hit me very early in this. Still very good and very drinkable. Very good with all the sourness but I wanted more of the cherry sweetness in this. It is a sipper due to the sourness but in some odd way that is what makes it so addictive. The flash of sweet and the huge sour kick. Very much like a cherry sweet tart and a better version of one. 1,339 charactersmulder1010, Feb 13, 2011

A: Poured into my Duvel Tulip, this brew pours a beautiful mahogany. The head retention is surprisingly non-existent, which is a huge let down for such a spectacular looking brew.
S: The aroma is that of fermented sour dark fruits, figs, bruised apples and a little grape. Sugar plumbs and cider wrap up the aroma.
T: The flavor is wonderfully sour tang with a sweet side. This brew is the perfect combination of sweet and sour. A good strong malty backbone prevents this brew from going over the tart edge. Flavors evident in the nose include sugar plumbs, cider vinegar, and dark fruit.
MF: Mouthfeel is a tad to light, and can improve, but no real complaints.
D: Drinkability is just perfect. Delectably sour, and at 10%, I cannot even tell except by the warmth in my tummy.
Overall, if you're new to sours, let this brew warm up. The tart will take the back seat, and the dark fruits and sugars come to the forefront. An expertly crafted brew, this can be enjoyed by anyone. 994 charactersTKEbeerman, Feb 13, 2011

375ml chilled, poured into a tulip.
One of my favorite RR beers, just finally reviewing it.
A - Pours a rich, dark caramel amber color. Nice tight white head, which hung on for a few minutes.
S - Tart, sour, twangy, with hints of wine and sugar. The cabernet is very apparent. Cherries, raisins, currants and touch of artificial grape smell (like grape candy).
T - Tart. Not so much sour as it is tart. Very wine like. Lemon, horse blanket and sweet fruit combine in a whirlwind of flavors. The tongue is almost over stimulated. The wine comes through and the aftertaste is all cab.
M - Full bodied, but not heavy or chewy. Coats the mouth nicely. Tight, clean and prickly carbonation. Fits the beer perfectly. The alcohol is almost indectable, except for the slight drying effect it has on the tongue.
D - Dangerously drinkable. This beer is sweet and tart which keeps the palate refeshed. I never get tired of drinking this beer, and am thankful that I have easy access to it. A fantastic beer. Caution is advised though, 10% abv will sneak up on you in a hurry! 1,085 charactersGenghis22, Feb 11, 2011

Body is clear reddish brown, like tea. Poured easily to a half inch head, which dissipates quickly to a ring, with no lacing. 
Aroma of cabernet wine, currant, malt, tea leaves, alcohol, leather.
Tastes of cabernet wine upfront, with currant and sour citrus tastes in the mid-plate, some vanilla, finishes dry with a lingering sourness and some spice. It is delicious, with a well-defined and intense wine infused sourness. It is mouthwatering sour, but not puckerish. There is not much of a malt backbone to this, which is unusual for a beer. I get some port-like quality to it as well, perhaps from the currants. There is no trace of tannins either. For a wild ale, it is also not funky. 
Body is light and carbonation is low, giving this a winey mouthfeel. Alcohol is evident, furthering the wine analogy.
This is a beer with a big flavor, but one that also seems not to be a beer. I could drink a couple glasses of this. 942 charactersBeerenauslese, Feb 08, 2011

Wow this beer is a trip to the wild side. And I'm a big fan of that side. The nose is really Bretty and musty. Scents reminiscent of a barn in the fall. 
Taste was much more exotic than the nose would suggest. Almost like a big sticky semi strong cheese. The beer clung to the palate as well as a cheese would too. This beer was not that sour(if your looking for a Gueuze like tartness don't come here) however it was very balanced between sweet, sour, and even a bit of saltiness. The sweetness was in the finish as the initial sip is pretty dry. A little bit of caramelly bisquit malts in the back and no hops to speak of. 
This beer was a nice addition to the quality and craftsmanship of not only RR but what American beers are and what they are becoming. Good quality beer but is it worth the price tag? You be the judge. 982 characterscooch69, Feb 08, 2011

Incredible aroma, dark fruity and tart, light funk, silkier yeasty notes, you can really get the currants, not much barrel in the bouquet, a merest hint of wine and vanilla.
Wowwww, what a flavor. these darker fruit notes fit so well with the funkier and more tart aspects, superbly balanced. The sip gets increasingly tart, but the fruit holds it in balance. Never seems vinegary,just a very clean vinous and deep ripe fruit. Finally the funk reappears, perfectly, creating a tart finish that doesn't overpower. As it warms some flowery and herbal notes come in to every of the flavors, and it gets stupidly complex and delicious. Only my tenth highly rated wild ale, Consecration is now my favorite.
Spritzy and bright on tongue, amazingly light on palate for so much flavor, and a finish that makes all other wilds I've tried seem inadequate.
Drinkability is off the charts. If I'd had more wilds under my belt this might have gotten a five 
Impression: Sadly a plane ticket will be required for my next taste of this. If you see this get it and try it ferabsolutesherrrr!!. 1,172 characterscavedave, Feb 06, 2011

Smells great - sour acetic notes dominate, but there is some wine as well and fruit underneath - strawberry, currents - and a bit of wild yeasty funk.
Taste - again sour acetic flavor is strong - like an extreme green apple - then a with a strong wine profile creeps in before finishing with a bitter grape skin taste.
Definitely heavier than temptation and supplication - but perfectly carbonated and pleasantly dry. 589 charactersreadbaron, Feb 06, 2011

Poured gently in to a Duvel glass, there isn't much heading here, though the color is nice. It is almost Dubbel-ish, coming out a murky rose color. Nose is full of tart fruit, strawberry, raspberry, sour funk, and a hint of dark chocolate. Mild sourness hits the palate at first, with an aftertaste of juicy stone fruit to round things out. Alcohol is nowhere ti be found on this one. Mouthfeel is medium, with the sourness always present, but never overbearing. The balance here is incredible, as is the case with pretty much all RR beers I have tasted. RR makes the wine of the beer world IMO, except more textured and delicious than most wines I have encountered. Russian River, please come to Massachusetts soon.

A: Hazelnut brown. The color actually reminded me a lot of maple syrup.
S: Shows a lot of effects from the aging in cabernet barrels. Along with the smell of cab, I picked up dark fruit aromas, currants, black cherries, blackberries and a hint of caramel.
T: Jammy with an oaky presence, brett, a nice sour bite, currants, raspberry, black cherry and some of that wonderful cab flavor. This is a wonderful beer and shows absolutely none of its high ABV. Scary drinkable. 493 charactersnotchucknorris, Feb 04, 2011

Appearance is dark red with very little head. The smell is bourbon, cherries, vanilla, and raspberries. As good as the smell is, the taste is quite a letdown - lemons, sour grapes, slight biscuit, bitters, and booze; really though, none of these flavors meld into anything too good.

Yet, as I crossed state lines with a cache of Russian River in tow, I felt more than an adrenaline-fueled thrill--I felt a pentecostal wind sweeping me onward and upward, giving my smuggled Consecration a heavenly imprimatur.
This rush continued once I uncaged and uncorked the 375ml bottle. A thick, luscious, tan head rapidly diminished to nothingness, without a trace of its once mighty presence. I poured it into a tulip glass, its mahogany taking on shades of plum and the beer appeared almost as if it were glowing from within the glass. Consecrated indeed! Its smell put me in a Proustian fit, immediately recalling childhood trips to Napa Vally where I was only allowed to merely smell the corks of the once-full bottles around me. The aroma was strong notes of fresh grapes and strawberries with an undercurrent of oak. Sipping the beer brought forth cherries, plums, and grapes--it was deliciously sour with a backbone of earth (no hiding the bit of brettanomyces in this beer). It finished with a hint of sweet raspberries. Its mouthfeel was a bit sticky, but nicely bodied. It makes for a fine sipping beer--the sort of beer you give a wine drinker who normally scoffs at beer. 
Russian River, as is its habit, has deeply impressed me once again. It somehow has mastered the act of transubstantiation--it is able to take a worldly object and transform it into something heavenly, something sacred, indeed, something consecrated. 1,557 characterswashingtonydc, Feb 02, 2011

deep amber red with a nice thin white head. 
Smells of old fermented apples and spice up front. Alcoholic in the nose as well. American wiskey and vanilla come through too.
Sour perfection on the first sip. Deeply sweet and sour! Estreme bitter with an alcoholic bite. Perfect in your face bitter/sour balance!
With such a bitter/sour taste, a nice fizzy champagne like mourthfeel to complement. Works and blends perfect as a result. Try this one, you will want to sip it again and again, than buy 
another one to do it all over again! 548 charactersTrueant1, Feb 01, 2011

Batch 004x3
This is really my first foray into the American Wild Ale category, a style quite unique with so much differentiation between the many beers within it. Some could be barnyard funky, some mouth-puckeringly sour. Russian River wilds are renowned for being of the sour variety, and are just frequently referred to as the RR Sours. I got this specific beer a few months ago in a trade and was waiting for a good time to open it, but just decided on a whim to throw it in the fridge today as I pretty much had nothing left waiting for me there. Good enough for me!
A - The cork releases with a huge pop, reassuring me that my caution in holding tight wasn't for naught. Even after just opening it, a slow rising wisp brings aromas of sour cherries. A deliberate pour unleashes a modest 1-finger, almost pure white head that is noisy as hell. Lots of hissing as it sheds some carbonation. Very active head, even after most of it quickly fades away. It reduces to thin, small islands floating on top of the beer, and multiple nucleation points let carbonation quickly rise, hit the surface, and then quickly disperse to the edges of the glass, leaving a nice ring there. The body is pretty normal looking; a dark golden brown amber with great clarity. As the glass empties, there's not much lacing left behind.
S - Moving to the nose, it's very difficult to decipher everything that's going on here. There's a little bit of funk here, but not overwhelmingly so. I can easily tell the cherries are tart and are going to impose a ton of sourness. Some light malts as well. There's something incredibly familiar about this beer but I can't place it for the life of me. Maybe some solvent smells? Not sure but each time I smell I get something different. Smells a bit of wine.
T - After the first sip I'm a bit stunned. In a way that makes me surprised and excited that beer can take so many different shapes and forms and keep bringing new things to the palate. There's so much going on here as well. Sour cherries, blackcurrants, grapes, a bit of oak from the barrels... it's all here. The alcohol is very well hidden as well which could be a blessing or a curse. The solvent note from the smell is back here and lends itself to a bit of a medicinal characteristic. At first the beer is very tart, but as the palate acclimates to it, it becomes a bit easier to drink, yet sometimes I liked to swish it around just to get the puckering sourness back.
M - Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Sourness lingers throughout the whole mouth after drinking this. Great feeling.
D - Drinkability is high. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV, I'm excited that my one of my first entrances into Wilds went over so well. Guess it didn't hurt I went with a pretty solid contender, but I can definitely see myself drinking more of this and even more of the RR sour portfolio.
Also, for some reason, I am getting a vibe of cool forests when drinking this, not exactly sure why, but it's a great, relaxing feeling. 3,125 charactersnhindian, Feb 01, 2011

Pours a dark reddish brown color with no head. Aroma full of malts and cherries; slightly sour, but not overwhelmingly so. Dark malt flavor with some nice sour cherry flavor. Medium-bodied with minimal carbonation. Darker than most sours I've had - I like the additional malts here, it works well. 330 charactersmithrascruor, Jan 30, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5After taking a trip to Belgium several months ago, I wasn't sure if I was ever going to see a culture that featured sours so much, if at all. Luckily I found some Russian River stuff in LA.
Poured from the 750mL caged and corked bottle into a tall flute.
A: The beer appears brown upon pouring but is pure red when held to light. Overall it is a rusty/amber sort of color, topped with a massive tan head that lasts quite a long time, finally settling down to a constant 1.5 - 2 fingers.
S: Very tart aroma, with acidic cherry and some fig coming through at first, then a nice bready, pie-crusty, biscuity malt comes through for an instant. It's then covered again by some acidic, funky, tart notes. Wild yeast makes a big appearance here. Then sour apple, more cherry, and slight medicinal character come through. So much complexity here. Awesome aroma.
T: Malty at first with some pie crust. Then the funk gets heaped on. Very sour character comes through here with slight cherry but more dark fruit notes and a hint of medicinal and alcohol. Insane midpalate and finish in which it's impossible for me to pick out some of the flavors. Yeast. Dark fruits. Bread. Sweet cereal. Tobacco. Wood. What the hell? This is great.
Notes: Not for the faint of heart. This is definitely a sour-lover's beer. Work up to this one. You'll be glad you did. 1,347 charactersBucBasil, Jan 29, 2011

While I will state up front that I prefer Supplication, having this on tap was a real treat. It is my #2 Russian River sour. 
On the initial whiff, you get light sour cherry / , currant-sweetness . It is surprising how sweet it smells compared to the taste. You can detect hints of the funk and sour to come, but it takes a moment to develop. Nice and musty, complex, and very pleasant aroma.
My only complaint is that it is a bit effervescent, at least straight from the tap, which affects the mouth feel and taste just a bit. I found that by holding it in my mouth and swirling a bit, it really reduces tha carbonation and brings out the flavor.
It is impossible to tell this is 10% just by drinking it. No alcohol hits the palate whatsover. Amazing drinkability on this one. 
Love this and all of the RR sours. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up... 917 characterscavemanlawyer, Jan 28, 2011

Pours a deep ruby color with golden mahogany edges and a two finger frothy off-white head. Good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting ring that coats the glass with large chunks of soapy lacing.
Funky, musty aroma with lots of earthy oak tannis, dry brett and vinous dark fruit. The barrel aging is very prominent in the nose with lots of red wine character. Hints of grape, currant, tart cherries and other dark berries as well as oak and subtle vanilla. This is complimented by the funky/barnyard/horsey notes. 
Full bodied, intensely tart and puckering with slight acidity and some soft carbonation up front. Very funky with lots of musty, dry brett/bugs as well as a sour vinegar flavor that lingers over the barrel and vinous dark fruit notes into puckering dry finish that leaves me drooling for more. As in the aroma, the barrel character is prominent with earthy oak, slight vanilla and a prominent red wine/dark fruit flavor. Hints of grape, currant cherry, plum, raisin and other dark berries. 
This beer has an incredible balance of tart, acidic, funky sourness and sweet, vinous dark fruit and it is the perfect blend of the wine and craft beer worlds. 1,187 characterscorby112, Jan 27, 2011

A- Dark sludgey blood-tinged brown. No head. Effervesces very fine bubbles. 
S- Lots of brett funk and sour fruit. The currants are definately lending a unique character to this brew! Present are also some rich malts that are reminding me of actually barleywine.
T- Very sour. Sweet, dark citric qualities are dominating from the currants. It has a similar quality of good red wine. A nice bitter edge way on the backburner means that this beer means business. I had chapped lips when i drank this, and it burns each crack so good. The 
M- Fantastic all considering! Carb is perfect quality. Medium body with a very tangy, bright feel. It does get a little overwhelming.
D- This does not taste alcoholic. 878 charactersTheSupremeAJ, Jan 23, 2011

A - Pours a deep red-brown with half a finger of light brown head.
S - Brett funk that I recognize from Supplication, but with a hint of the currants and a fruity sweetness. Almost like a funky red wine.
T - Very tart and sour. A deep sourness dominates your palate. The brett flavor from Supplication is present, as are currants. I don't know enough about wine to say that I was tasting Cabernet, but I was definitely tasting "red wine" to some degree. There is also a bit of dark cherry flavor present. It is very similar to Supplication.
M - Medium body with active carbonation and a very dry finish.
D - So impossibly easy to drink for a 10%. No booze at all. Delicious and a real joy to experience such a unique beer. High marks because of the ease of drinking compared to the ABV. 871 charactersgreenmonstah, Jan 21, 2011

S - Brett yeast is the predominant aroma. Not much else is coming through but the brett is so overpowering nothing should be able to come through. Smells exactly like Supplication, with a hint of currants in the background.
T - Once again, I haven't had many wild beers, so I can't place the tastes as well as most might be able to, but the sour flavor of the wild yeasts is predominant to me. Dark fruits, specifically the currant and some cherry which could be coming from the yeast. 
M - Medium bodied, low carbonation, both expected with this beer. Finish is dry and sour with some sweetness from the fruits.
D - Very drinkable, ABV doesn't seem like it's close to 10%. One of the most sour beers I have ever had, but still surprisingly easy to drink and go back for more. 902 charactersGarrettMD, Jan 21, 2011

Taste, excellent, tart, yet substantial, tannins dry out the mouth, wood flavor melds with everything else. Slight cherry flavor. Even though very red and brown in appearance, comes off very dry. Currants, brown sugar.
Extremely drinkable, alcohol doesn't seem to be present at all. Couldn't give it a perfect 5, it is just too expensive to get a perfect score. 
Loved having this in the bottle as well, the cork was all twisted to one side, so you knew there was lots of carbonation in there (not too much though). 632 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jan 20, 2011

A - Pours a dark brown with reddish highlights. The one inch foamy white head quickly dissipates, leaving no haze or lacing. Aggressive carbonation is highly visible.
S - Wow, there's a lot going on here. Tart red berries (currants and raspberries), red wine vinegar, cinnamon, oak, vanilla, brown sugar and funk. Insanely complex.
T - Incredibly sour, tastes of red wine, more red berries, brown sugar, oak and tobacco. Flavors rise and fall as this beer warms up, not unlike a nice red wine. 
M - Medium-thin body with sharp, stabbing carbonation. There's a dry, puckering effect on the palate, just completely numbs out your mouth.
D - While this is certainly a sipper, I had absolutely no problem drinking the bottle (almost) by myself. 832 charactersjsanford, Jan 20, 2011

The color is a clear ruby red with a slight finger of foamy white head that leaves fast and there is no lacing on the glass.
The smell is woody with some barely-wine like aroma. Some currant and raisin aroma. There is a hint of DR. Pepper there in the background as well with a sugary flavor that is hard to place.
The taste is sour at first, there is a bit of sour cherry flavor that hits the tongue and spirals though the taste buds. The oak is there in the back and is boarding the fruit and sweet malty flavor from getting away before the sour flavor makes things crooked. 
The feel of this beer is pretty big, there is a large flavor and it finds its way down but has an aftertaste that lasts and lasts. Smooth is the feel but there is a punch coming at the end 828 charactersDuhast500, Jan 18, 2011

Came to the table with a nice looking dark brown with a thick tan head that dissapated to about 1/4" and stayed there. Not alot of sticky lacing though.
Smells of alot of bret funk with tart cherries and some oak. 
Taste is wonderful hands down best sour I have had so far. You can really taste the wine notes from the barrels and the oak and bret mixed with the malts is sublime. Wonderful
Mouthfeel is perfect for this beer. Couldn't ask for more.

Had on tap at Toronado. Pours a deep amber/red with minimal head and no real lace. Not too surpeizing for the ABV. Smells like sour grapes and funk with a sweetness at the end. Taste-wise it is hard to pick things out through the sour. There is some sour, some funk and bread (along with a few things that I can't put my finger on. I'm surprized at the lack of booze being that it's the big 10. Perfect mouth for a good sipping beer. I've been enjoying the slowly fading aftertaste. 
I prefer Temptation or Supplication but I'll rate this high anyway being that it is still an amazing sour. Thanks again Russian River (and thank you bartender for the free beer!) 705 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, Jan 16, 2011

Pours a very dark garnet color, almost ruby when held to the slight, lots of small champange sized bubbles that settled into a nice collar. The nose is restrained but inviting, sour dark fruits, figs and dates. Earthy, damp, musty are things that came to mind. The flavor is unquestionably more sour, very acidic, chalky, very dry. Has almost a chocolately, earthy component, not unlike characteristics I get from some belgian quads, definitely interesting. Oak from the barrel aging is also noticable. High ABV with this one compared to some other Russian River wild ales, the body is a little more full, the malt a little more perceived. After having this fresh on tap at the brewpub and after a couple years in the bottle, I prefer the older and bottled version. 865 charactersDspohn, Jan 14, 2011

Poured from a 375ml bottle into a chalice. The corked came out easily with a nice 'pop.' Fizzy rusty head of about an inch quickly dissipated. Reddish, brown color with a slight cloudiness. 
Aroma of red wine, musty wet wood and leather. Mouthwatering. Lively carbonation that leads into a fruity, tartness followed by leather and earth. Dark fruits. Finish is long and smooth, yet acidic at the same time. Perfectly balanced sourness. In a blind taste taste, I could not tell if this was 4% or 10% abv. Amazing.

The colour is beer bottle brown with some hot pink tones in the light. The nose is amazing. Real tart scents of cranberry and mild oak. A bit over carbonated but seems to work with this weird concoction. This taste more like a lambic to me. The fruit notes are extremly strong in this one. A bomber is definately to be shared as this is a late night sipper. The 10% doesnt hit you over the head but the tartness does. Reminds me of a cranberry fruit wine from our area. They used cab sauv barrels and there is a real wine influence here. A little Pinot Noir maybe. If you know a wine guy, this would be an interesting bottle to show off at a late night get together with some cheese and crackers.
Beer? This is somthing a bit beyond beer. Perhaps it needs it own catagory. Glad I tried it for the experiance but not a beer for watching the game tonight. This is unique and very different. As this is is quite a long review, I have had quite a few sips and I must say as both it and I warm up, that it is growing on me. Sort of like those sour candies that you just cant stop eating. 1,220 charactersLazyL, Jan 13, 2011

Appearance- poured into a wine glass a light amber red with golden honey highlights and a small layer of white head that quickly dissipates and leaves a ring around the glass
Smell- leather, barnyard, slight vinegar, grape tannins, currant
Taste- barnyard funk, wood, and tartness up front with a dry currant finish. good balance and complexity of flavor. the tartness from the bacteria and funk from the brett is put in check by the sweetness from the fruit and the oak.
Mouthfeel- crisp, dry, refreshing, lively
Drinkability- alcohol is well masked, may be a bit too sour and tart for some due to the style...but well balanced with the fruit and easy to drink...but hard to find on the East Coast...and when you do it comes with a high price tag. 765 charactersmyatomicpolygon, Jan 11, 2011

Batch 004x2. Pours a dark amber color, little to no head. A constant stream of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass keeps it from being completely still. Smell has a good amount of funk with some fruitiness behind. Taste is sour, but not over the top. Just enough lactic sourness for my liking. The currents are there, but in good balance. Starts off slightly sweet, and finishes dry, funky, and sour. Delicious. Mouthfeel is lively. The 10% is no where to be found, the nature of the style hurts drinkability slightly... but I could drink quite a bit of this one. RR is the king of American made sours, and this one is near the top. 708 characterskhumbard, Jan 09, 2011

Pours out a nice dark red, almost mahogany like color. Ivory colored head emerges from this. Held to the light can see very active carbonation. Head settles to thin layer on top of beer. In light the body lights up to a brilliant ruby. Head stays around for whole session but no lacing is present.
Most sourness with red currants that are very prevalent. This is the first time having this and it honestly smells amazing. Really like the red currant smell.
Tart and sour just like the smell. Much more sour than I thought it was going to be (haven't had a lot of sours up to this point). However, as the session went on was able to get used to the sourness. The currants make themselves known as well. By the end of the glass, this became really balanced for me and I really wasn't even noticing the sourness, was more of a subtle sourness. Very nice.
This was pretty well carbonated. I have no idea if it is too high for the style or what but I felt a good amount of carbonation when the beer was on the tongue. Regardless, I really like how this feel goes down.
Amazingly drinkable. I wasn't sure what to expect in regards to sourness but this is very well done and taste great. I'll be buying this a lot many times over and over. 1,335 charactersSwimsum, Jan 06, 2011

A.
A dark maroon color, when held up to the light you get the reds to come out. Its relatively clear and a head that is pretty much non existent. 
S.
Funky sour smell with some wine characteristics. Musty smell, a little oak, and some dark fruit like cherries coming out. (the currants I'd imagine). I've been on a lambic kick lately and I love the aroma of this as it similar, yet different. 
T.
A sour dominant beer. The first taste you get is sourness and it lingers for quite awhile. The other flavors are hard to pickup because of the sourness, but I get a little fruity red wine in there with a dry finish. 
M.
light bodied. Carbonation is there (but doesnt look like it from the appearance) You get the acidic feeling on the tongue and a nice dry finish.

A little low in this category because of cost, availability, ABV, and taste. I think the taste is good, but not so good that I have to try another. 943 characterscetherid, Jan 05, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 Batch #003 poured into a snifter. Hazy brown with little to no head.
Smelled like wine, had the defined cabernet nose to it. Somewhat sweet and was dry and earthy.
Taste was sour that turned into a mild sweetness. The lingering sourness had sense of a shot of lemon juice and other citrus.
It's got a hefty tartness but it doesn't put off and it's really good.
I feel like there should be more to say about this but there really isn't. It's a straight forward, fantastic sour ale. It's a fantastic beer that is very drinkable and extremely enjoyable. 559 characterscjacobsen, Jan 04, 2011

A--Rusty reddish hue, not that much lacing or retention.
S--Classic funk smell, you can also really smell the currants in this, barnyard funk baby.
T--Wonderful sour flavors highlighted by a touch of cherry and currants. Oak really comes through, sweet, tart, really, really, tasty. 
M--Good feel. Silky and not over carbonated.
D--Supplication is still my favorite, but this is a damn fine beer. I am consistently impressed by the sours turned out by RR. Obviously, this is a must try if you are a sour fan. 707 charactersgarbercury, Jan 02, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch # 004X2
A: Golden-amber, with mahagony tones. Clear though bottom of bottle has a slight haze. Little to no foam.
S: The first whiff gives one the indication of a very special brew. Oak barrel influenced, soured, semi-dark fruits. It's inviting and mysterious. 
T: First impression is refreshingly tart and dry. The after taste is unbelieveably enticing but I can't separate the various flavor notes. It's a complex blend of taste sensations, and all morphing together then separting, but in the end very inviting. Never would guess the high abv in tastings.
D: RR has taken beers to a different level, which I mean in the most respectfull way. The aroma is as almost as attractive as the taste. As a fan of Imperial Stouts and big IPAs, at times I don't think I have the sosphistication for sours and wild ales, but this brew is easy to understand. The subelty of the complexity of this brew is the amazing skill of the brewer. So, the downside of loving RR is the difficulty in obtaining. Joy of the hunt. 1,017 characters2BDChicago, Dec 31, 2010

S= To me I pick up on cherries, some sour apples kind of smells like a wine almost.
T= The taste is really amazing I believe this is the first time I've been exposed to this style and I really like it. It kind of starts off sweet and then turns sour dig it.
M= Good carbonation. I think the carbonation kind of balanced the bitterness and sours in this one.
D= I think this is a great beer would love to try more. 520 charactersLiquidBread219, Dec 29, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A- Pours an amber with almost a purplish hue. Great head that stays. Pretty unique and looks awesome.
S- Dark Cherries, Sour Apple, Sweet brown sugar, and a whole lot more. This is getting exciting. Probably one of the best noses on a beer.
T- Exceptional, if all sours tasted like this I would be a happy man. Tastes of slightly tart green apples, dark fruits, sweet malt, and has a nice dry finish with the sourness shining through. Killer.
M-A little thick but should be expected in such a complex beer, great carbonation.
D- My favorite Sours and now one of my favorite beers hands down. 595 charactersSeattleBeerBlog, Dec 28, 2010

A nice introduction to both Id say..
Batch001X4 - 750ml Caged and Corked.
A -Dark and Deep Red, Almost brown and fairly opaque. Very little head if any.
S - Lots of sourness, dark and sweet candy. I pick up some new fruit and slight oak as well.
T - Just amazing. I not completely versed in how these tend to age but I find the sourness fades a bit and the fruit becomes more evident. The currants, fig, and candy notes were outstanding and really stood up the brett/lacto nicely. The oak tends to develop nicely and become more prevalent with aging. It was only a bit but I felt like the oak was there on the finish. I was surprised it had any left but the carbonation was perfect.
M - Perfect. The carbonation wasn't low but just the way I prefer for this style.
What a great vintage and an even better way to share with friends. Thanks techster82 1,024 charactersAndrewNations, Dec 27, 2010

A: Brown pour, ruby highlights, thin, off-white to tan head faded pretty quick but left decent lace.
S: Funky, sour, lactic tang, dark fruit, black currant, cask wood. A huge nose with the promise of great things to taste.
T: Incredibly sour, tangy, oaky. Black currant, dark, bready malt, barnyard, brett bitterness, lacto tanginess, vinous, tobacco leaves.
M: Highly carbonated, satisfying. The carbonation balances the intense sourness well.
D: Incredible. Amazing. Easily rivals anything brewed in Belgium. Brewing brilliance at its finest. I wish it were more widely available. 602 charactersAmbiorix, Dec 26, 2010
3.73/5  rDev -15.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Batch 003x001
Pours an amber/brown but when held up to the light comes across as rose.
The smell is very complex with many wine like qualities. Smells sour, raisny, oak, and a slight chocolate background.
The taste is also pretty sour . Oak and age smooth the alcohol out very nicely and make it easy to sip. 
This isnt a beer youd want to drink too fast, more so to just enjoy it through out a night and good dinner. I probably wouldnt buy this beer again though due to the high price but Im glad I got to try it once. 523 charactersEriktheipaman, Dec 26, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours out a deep ruby brown with very little head and no lacing. 
Smell is plum, vinegar, date, sour, and musty. I will preface my ratings by mentioning that the dark fruits used in this sour are not my favorite flavors in general.
taste is dates, sour acidity, old basement mustiness, dark fruits really shine through in the flavor, more so than most fruits do in most sours and lambics I have had. Fig and date notes really hold up well and balance the sour.
Mouthfeel is dry with suprisingly high lively carbonation based on the little head.
Very drinkable and refreshing. Strong flavors, but very pleasant and unique flavor profile. I want more! 653 characterspdoran10, Dec 25, 2010
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to mlaroche for this one.
Batch 003x4
Pours a dark amber color, smallish head that fizzes away very quickly, no lacing or cap.
Smell has a nice funky aroma to it, picking up just the right amount of sour mixed with dark fruit and a subtle oak presence, bit of an astringent alcohol note though.
Taste starts out with a sour pucker, the currants add a nice layer of fruitiness that isn't overly sweet, this is one beer where the barrel aging is perfect since it complements the beer wonderfully, the oak has just the right balance, the strength is well hidden behind the tartness, the carbonation is quite active but works for this style. 648 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Dec 24, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 002x3
Consecration has a deep ruby-colored body that appears to be brown in the absence of light. The tan head is very fizzy, appearing and disappearing more quickly than head on a soda would.
The aroma has a lot going on, with all kinds of wild yeast providing musty and sour notes, a little bit of sweet malts, some wood and a dose of currants.
Two distinct flavors that I notice right away are the piquant sourness of the lacto, and the musty, horsey flavor from the brett. Between the two, the sourness from the lacto is definitely more powerful, as the brett lingers in the background, adding complexity. Next I notice a little bit of oak and a good currant flavor that I would guess has faded over the couple of years since this beer was brewed. A little bit more sourness comes next, but it is more acidic and a little less sharp than what I encountered in the beginning. A bit of moderately dark sweet malt pops up, but only for a second before the finish is big and dry, with notes of dry red wine in it.
The carbonation is fairly high and almost champagne-like when it first hits your mouth.
Having bought this bottle in PA, I paid quite a bit for it. Looking back, I wish I had bought a whole case of the stuff. It certainly isn't the type of beer you could drink a few of in a night, but it is the type of beer you could drink one of all night. 10% ABV? I would have believed it was 6% if someone had told me, the alcohol is nowhere to be found amidst the layers of yeast, barrel character and malt. 1,522 charactersHojaminbag, Dec 22, 2010

3.95/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip. Nice clear ruby dark red color. A small off white head is here. Not much lacing at all.
Nice aroma of plum. There is just a bit of sweetness to balance out the tart aroma.
The flavor mimics the aroma almost exactly. There sour flavor is nicely balanced here, allowing for a nice malt flavor to shine through. The complexity of the plum flavors are nicely accompanied by a bit of spiciness.
The body is light to medium, and the carbonation is softer than a lot of other wild ales (because of the relatively high ABV). This is very good, but not one of my favorites from Russian River. Still, this gives a unique flavor that one can't find elsewhere. I still look forward to trying this one again (hopefully soon). 736 charactersandrewinski1, Dec 21, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Batch 004x2 with plenty of carbonation
Pours a brown/amber color with an inch of white head and tiny bubbles. Doesn't leave lacing down the glass.
Smells like dark malts and funk. Sourness is picked up in the nose with a nice funk to go with it.
Taste is of dark malt, tobacco and malty sweetness with a sour 
barnyard finish. Delicious beer.
Mouthfeel is nice and prickly. Cleans off in a few moments after a sip and is not too heavy, yet not too light either.
Drinkability is great. Finished the 12ozer in a few minutes without a struggle. Only thing slowing me down is typing this review.
A great RR sour, little expensive tho, but nice for a celebration night. 670 charactersbs870621345, Dec 21, 2010

A: Pours a murky-brown color with an off-white head that dissipated quickly.
S: The nose is of pure sweetness and funk.
T: Tart fruits and sourness. Lots and lots of sourness. I'm trying to pick up on other things here... pick out certain types of tart fruits, but I'm struggling. Maybe some very mild cherry, but it's tough to tell as this is just overwhelmingly sour to me.
Taste also has a vinegar-red-wine sourness that you get if you open up a bottle of red, don't finish it, put it in your refrigerator for a week or so, then take it back out and drink it.
I will say this, the 10% ABV is very hidden here. I don't pick up on any alcohol presence at all.
M: This beer finishes sour. I'm not sure what else to say about this.
D: It was fun to try... a lot of fun to try. But it's not terribly drinkable for me. I wouldn't have wanted another one that night, and I don't think I would be interested in trying it again until some time passes. I certainly wouldn't go so far as to say I'd never try it again, just not anytime in the next several weeks. 1,218 characterspsuKinger, Dec 20, 2010

750mL Batch 002x3
Poured in to my Brooklyn tulip
A: This beer pours a clear, mahogany brown color with a 2 finger of sudsy khaki colored head. This one was actually a bit of a gusher. Head recedes rapidly leaving minor spots of lacing on the glass and a ringlet around the edge of the glass that holds the whole way through. 
S: Nose is sour, sour, sour. Lots of sour grape notes, mild funk, perhaps a hint of soured cherry, and oak. 
T: Taste starts off with semi-sweet fruity notes mingled with a bit of oak here that cut a bit of the acidity. Middle has a very brief presence of hay, grassy notes and and LOTS of funk. Those light hay notes are quickly overcome by a bite your ass sourness that is the photonegative of the start of this beer. Nice sharp, sour grape flavors hit you and hang a bit on the tongue afterwards. 
M: Medium body, moderate to high carbonation, starts of out extremely dry then becomes a bit prickly, and finishes bone freaking dry!
D: Goes down easily, very tasty, major kick, somewhat filling, very good representation of style. I can't believe that I passed on this when at RR last year. Oh how a year can make such a difference in opening up your palate... 1,329 charactersJayli, Dec 16, 2010

bath 004X3
A - dark brown/cranberry color, like you poured a brown ale into rose wine. not much head to speak of, so no lacing, but it does have legs like a good wine
S - first thing i got was like sticking your head in a pouch of chewing tobacco, then i got really dark colored fruits, they are very bright, slight hint of alcohol and some barnyard funkiness
T - starts with the tart, bitingness of the lacto, then a caramel middle with hints of raspberry and green apple, the sides of my tongue are getting more of the sour. the back end of the palette gets more tobacco, earthy flavor
M - medium bodied, well carbonated almost to the point of bubbly, finishes rather clean except on the side of the palette where it lingers
D - hard to put down. lots of nuances to this beer that would lend itself to aging (lucky enough i have another bottle). russian river strikes again with a great wild/sour. 955 characterswchesak, Dec 15, 2010
4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Lost Abbey stemware glass. It poured a brownish/deep red color with a very fizzy and active head to it. The head settled down very quickly, almost like a cola.
The aroma shows off an acidic sourness as well as some fruity notes to it. The currents give it a tart and dry fruitiness that is very nice. The sourness is sharp with moderate acidicness. Just a hint of the woody, barrel character comes through. 
The taste starts off with a sharp acidic bite to it with more of the moderately sweet current fruitiness coming through. As you get closer to the finish more sour and tart flavors come through. The currents leave a grape/wine like dry, tartness on the palate. It's great in how the sweet and tart flavors both come through so well in it. It's definitely one of the more tart and sour beers of the style I've had. 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied overall, and more heavy then most I've had in the style. Carbonation is very high and sharp. Drinkability is good, it had some excellent flavors to it and some great complexity. As I said before I loved how it had both sweet and tart flavors at the same time. The currents were also excellently done. Very tart and sour too. Excellent beer overall. 1,239 charactersbillab914, Dec 14, 2010

Aroma is actually quite mild for the style, currants, subtle (winey) oak and sour aromas. Taste is this beer's strength, a well balanced mixture of sweet fruity flavors of the currants and the lemony tartness. Some oak flavor as well but nothing overpowering. Palate is smooth with a nice dry tart finish, I can also get a bit of alcohol heat, which I understand now that I've seen this beer's ABV. Not something I'm used to for the style but quite interesting. 564 charactersLuk13, Dec 11, 2010

S- Smells great... first wiff is sweet, sour, and funky. After some swirls of the snifter, a bit more booze is present
T- Tastes amazing. Sweet and sour at the same time, and extra funky tasting. Has a very subtle woody taste that lingers throughout and an ever so little amount of booziness coming through in the finish
M- Medium body with medium carbonation... leaves that great sour funky taste clinging in your mouth

Thanks to troywhittaker for gifting this bottle during Rare Beer Night 9/2010.
Appearance is tawny amber in color with off white head that slowly fades to thin lace.
Smells of aging fruit, red wine, dash of vinegar.
Taste as it smells with solid caramel and dark fruit malt support. Less sour quality that expected, perhaps this is more vident with age. Alcohol is well hidden and light tart sourness works as a respectable distraction.
Medium body, medium+ lively carbonation.
Very drinkable as a mellow and malt balanced sour. This may chnage over time, but much more enjoyable and approachable than I expected. 832 charactersunclejimbay, Dec 08, 2010

Smells like a sour wine but made with currants. There is a bit of a grape aroma that I'm detecting as well, but it's mostly sour currants and I'm okay with that.
Tastes like a sour-lovers dream. One of the sourest beers I've ever had, tart currants and grape-skins invade the pallet and the wine barrels come through in the taste as well. 
For 10%, this is one of the most drinkable beers I have come across, and I will continue to do whatever I can to get my hands on this even if I have to drive 300+ miles every month. 598 charactersEstocker, Dec 08, 2010
4.02/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Served on-tap in a tulip at TJ's Restaurant and Drinkery's 7th Anniversary. 
A deep crimson color with blood red/copper hues and light orange accent with good clarity for the style. The cap of beige appears when swirled in the tulip, the bead is ultrafine-pin sized bubbles with gentle spots of lace sticking.
The smell of currant and dark wine grapes is immediate when the glass nears my nostrils, there is a sublte sour scent which combines with spice and mild oak aspects but there is mild sweet odors adding to the complex sour aroma w/ mild currant/berry and grape aroms. 
 The feel is so highly acidic it seems astringent and sharp up front. The sour lingers and makes me pucker and then the acidity and slight alcohol move forward only after a spice tinge do you get any type of sweetness, the effervescence is moderately high. The flavor mirrors the nose and mouthfeel with sweet tarts and bitter grape flavors with a dash of currant sweetness and slight tannic fruit skin elements. The light sour apple flavor adds dimension to the depth of sour and acidic tastes going on here. 
 This is not a wild ale for the faint of heart, it is strong puckering and I consider it only above average drinkability-wise overall, just not something I could see have many back to back of, a good wild brew and I guess Vinnie has us spoiled because this is great, just not outstanding like his other American Wild ales. 1,414 charactersSlatetank, Dec 06, 2010

The beer was amber in color and smelled of berries and spice. The beer's alcohol content was well-hidden in this beer. It was tart, but no strong bitter aftertaste. 
This beer is very different from its counterparts Damnation and Supplication and I would rank it second amongst the three. I would definitely recommend this beer-so good! Enjoy! 498 charactersChincino, Dec 05, 2010

A - Pours deep amber with a thin film of white head that leaves minimal lacing down the glass.
S - Strong tartness up front, strongest of the three. Hints of spices, berries, and oak. Aroma's don't linger for long but they leave a lasting impression.
T - Not the first time I have had this one. Starts with a bit of spice from the currents quickly giving way to a blast of strong tartness. Finish is a lingering funk with a bright acidic note. I prefer the other two, supplication and temptation, but I still like this one a lot. Still one of my favorite wild's.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Tart finish lingers but not for too long. It wears you down after a full glass.
D - Fairly high. I really like this one but when you put all three of these together you really see how different they really are. I would rank this one last out of the three but it is still so good that you can not go wrong. Glad I have a few bottle of this in the cellar. 1,116 charactersorangesol, Dec 05, 2010

4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from tap at Belmont Station into snifter ~ comparison tasting with Consecration, Supplication, and Temptation.
This was my personal favorite of the trio. This is one strong mother! Absolutely amazing.
The appearance is lovely with a dark, deep hue and decent carbonation for a barrel aged sour/brett beer.
Nice aromas of currants, oak, spice, and red fruit delightfully frame the funky brettanomyces core.
The palate is lovely and takes the drinker through a magical land of red fruits, tart cherries, fig, and yeast. Lots of complexity and many layers of flavor evolve and change as the beer slightly warms towards room temperature.
The beer has a lovely medium body, with just a slight overbearing kick of alcohol (hence the 4.5 not 5.0 for mouthfeel). A little more body or slightly less alcohol perhaps? Nonetheless, near perfection here.
So delicious and packed with flavor that you can't put the glass down! And I recommend that you NOT put your glass down if you won't want to share! (as I found out) 1,020 characterscbarrett4, Dec 02, 2010

S: Sour as expected with a currant scent. For someone who hasn't has currants, it's a sweet plum/fig/raisin smell. Very pleasant. With the wood scent, it can even be compared to sweet baked beans.
T: A sour smack in the face right from the start, which is great, since I like sour beers. This beer is sour, followed by tartness, followed by more puckering sourness. The currants can be tasted right as the beer passes my lips, but that is all. The yeast/bacteria combination delivers a crazy funkiness that tastes like nothing else I've ever had. There is barely any sweetness. I can't believe this is 10% ABV because I don't detect ANY alcohol.
M: Crisp and bubbly. I was expecting it to be heavier but it is fairly clean due to the acidity as well.
D: I would like to say I could drink these all day, but the acidity would probably wear out my tongue. Since I only have the privilege to drink one, I can only assume. 1,043 charactersJemonster, Nov 30, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap at Eulogy Belgian Tavern, Olde City during their sour week.
Poured into a tulip, dark ruby red color with about one finger of hesd which dissipates quickly leaving very little if no lacing.
Aromas of dark fruit, cherry/fig. Red wine gone bad.
Taste is sour and tart. A slight bit of sweetness for balance.
Mouthfeel was medium bodied with some carbonation, dry, very dry.
Very drinkable, you hardly notice the 10% ABV on the finish. Becomes more funky as it warms. I like this beer... 496 charactersInspectorBob, Nov 28, 2010
4.64/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 750ml bottle, batch 3x3 with almost no head but still retains carbonation. One of the most aromatic beers I have ever had. Smells like an entire bouquet of berries and wine and a bit of wood. Tastes very very tart and has a hot after taste. Lots of wine flavoring that comes through in every sip. This is very drinkable for being so strong but it is still a sipper because each sip needs to be enjoyed and savored on a special occasion. 450 charactersbeerhan, Nov 28, 2010
4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3From notes (2010 Capone's Black Friday event). Menu noted that this is from Vintage Batch 002:
A: Hardly any head, beautiful dark ruby red. Sort of like an expensive wood used to make high-dollar furniture.
S: Smells like sour candy. Strong cherry, sugar, red wine vinegar, very slight oak.
T: TASTES like sour candy! It's amazing, considering the time it spent in an oak barrel, how little the oak is present, and how little edge it actually took off. Many people who tried it at my table compared the taste to challenging one another to keep several Warhead candies in their mouths at once. Hardly any funk detectable, more like a lambic than anything.
M: Maybe it's because I had a well-aged batch, but there was no alcohol heat, burn, no sign of the 10% whatsoever. The sugary candy characteristics might make your back teeth hurt, though.
D: It's really a lovely flavor, but it is not a beer that should be paired with dinner, nor is it one that you should expect to finish a glass (however small) of within a short period of time. It is far more interesting than any dessert wine I've ever had in my life though, which makes it well worth its high price by default.
A lovely beer, and it definitely makes me want to try Supplication - I'm curious as to what a year or so more oak aging does to this formula. 1,319 charactersmfunk9786, Nov 28, 2010

I've had bottled & corked Consecration on multiple occasions, but this is my first RR sour in a growler format. Batch #4. 
Poured a gorgeous, clear root beer brown with light tan edges. Despite sitting in a growler for 2 weeks, I got a 1/2 inch, white head with compact bubbles. The head fizzled out quickly leaving a fine ring of fizz around the edges of my Lost Abbey tulip.
I got sour cherries, apple cider and new oak on the nose. There was also hints of figs and strawberries. Rich and stong, very nice.
Wow, what a beer. Complex, full bodied and masterfully balanced. The flavor hits you big at first, then fades quickly leaving a faint and pleasing oak film in the aftertaste. There are so many flavors swirling around in the sourness that it's hard to identify them! Like the nose, the predominant flavors are sour cherries, apple cider and new oak. 
The champagne yeasts in this beer work perfectly. Not too much, not too little. 
I am officially ready to move to the San Diego area so I can have RR sours on a regular basis. 1,112 charactersbeachbum1975, Nov 26, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Great Divide balloon glass as a Thanksgivng dessert. From a bottle labeled Batch 004x5
The beer has somewhat of a head when poured, but it quickly dies down. The beer itself is a rich, deep red and is wonderfully clear.
The smell of the beer is vinegar, but ther are also some sweet fruits that go along with it. Interesting.
The taste is wonderfully complex. An initial hit of sweetness and dark fruits. Followed by a bite of acetic acid which mellows out into a smooth finish. I typically hate acetic acid in a beer, but this is more of a refreshing burst instead of a lingering unpleasantness. Excellent depth.
The weight on my mouth is great. The beer spreads to all of the parts of my mouth and coats my tounge with a varie of colors. For being an acetically dominated sour beer, this is wonderfully drinkable. I normally can't handle these, but the finish here is so inviting that I can't help but drink more. I'm finding it harder and harder to not fall in love with Russian River. They need to start distributing to Texas! 1,048 charactersUTCengOwl, Nov 25, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Whoa way darker than I thought it would be... a ruddy cherrywood brown color with moderate tan head. I guess it makes sense since this is a kriek-esque brew, but it just surprised me. Smell is tart with some cherries, a bit of funk, some leather. Taste follows suit, a bit tart, but not as tart as some other RRs I've had, with nice cherry flavor that flirts with medicinal flavors (not overpowering thank God). Decent malt to it, a bit of an oak touch on the finish as well. MF was medium-light, dry finish, about normal for a sour. I was pretty surprised that this one was 10%, pretty easy drink. Worth a try, but at $17 a bottle, I find it hard to justify when I can get other fruit lambics that are almost just as good (or just as good) for half the price. Rose de Gambrinus, for example, (I know it's raspberries and not cherries) is every bit as good as this guy, in my opinion. 884 charactersLordAdmNelson, Nov 24, 2010
3.92/5  rDev -11.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Chimay goblet.
Appearance is a great ruby red color, almost mahogany. Bit worried about the lack of head though, almost like the secondary fermentation in the bottle didn't happen. No head, no pop when cork came out of the bottle.
Smell is malt that gives way to sourness, bit of funk. Dark fruits.
Taste is sourness all over, tart fruit, bit of vinegar. Pretty heavy malts mixed in, but overpowered by the sour and fruits. Touch of vanilla and oak. 
Mouthfeel is full and thick, not helped by the lack of carbonation. 
Drinkability is great for such a big beer, and even despite the carbonation. 
I feel bad because my only experience with this beer is with lack of carbonation, so I can't tell if it's the beer or just the bottle. 772 charactersgtn80, Nov 24, 2010

Batch 004X2.
Pours the color of cherry stained wood...A half an inch of head falls to hardly a ring...Spots of lacing slide back into the liquid. As I pour this beer tart aromas fill the room, and you can hear the carbonation fizzing away.
It is vinous...I smell sour cherry, leather, oak, and farm yard scents...Just like Temptation, I smell a faint hint of pickles...It reminds me of a good balsamic salad dressing. As it warms more of the farm funk comes out.
Red wine vinegar leads the way with hints of sour cherry and currant jelly...the flavors are pleasant and well balanced...sour but not too sour.
A mild citric acid bite...a fizzy carbonation that reminds me of pop-rocks...it has a medium body, and dry finish.
A dam good, well crafted beer. I could only drink one or two in a sitting, but I sure would like to have a cellar full of this treat. Another beer that will remain on my wants list. 931 characterssitarist, Nov 22, 2010

Grapes and wine! That is what dominated the nose, and there were traces of malt, spice and yeast in the background. Oh yes, this is mouth-puckeringly sour brew. Tart, tangy and sour, they wine flavor wasn't as strong as the had led me to expect.
The body was good, although a bit thinner than I would have liked. Drinkability was very good for a sour and the beer stayed puckerific to the last drop.
Overall, a good beer, a must try if you see it. 660 charactersbeertunes, Nov 20, 2010

Moderate carbonation and a dry, prickly, slick mouthfeel. Sour up front with cranberry and balsamic notes, apple, leather, and a hint of vanilla and tobacco on the finish before returning to a lingering, puckering cherry tartness. Alcohol is almost completely masked.
Temptation is probably my all-around favorite from Russian River, but this and Supplication are right up there as well. A wonderful treat to savor slowly! 607 charactersgrittybrews, Nov 20, 2010

Small bit of foam but rapidly dissipates, leaving no lacing. Very pretty, clear brown beer with edges having a light amber hue.
Heavenly smell that hints at wine, salt, sourness, oak, slight malt. The taste is nearly identical, and has depth to it that makes you want to take more and more sips. Not overwhelmingly sour either which keeps the mouthfeel well balanced. Perfect carbonation.
Highly drinkable. I would give this a 5 but it can get sour and a little cloying after a while. 649 charactersChizoad, Nov 14, 2010

Poured into a Duvel tulip... A fairly clear soft brownish amber with a short lived head that fades to a ring... 
Really loving the aromas here... A slightly tart vinous aspect... Some straight out funk... I think maybe even some green apple and hints of chocolate? Whatever, it smells terrific... Very intriguing...lots of leather and earthiness as well..
Bracingly sour at first but quickly into a medley of leather, tart green apples, hints of chocolate, barnyard funk, and vinousness... Carbonation level is perfect for this beer... Crisp and sharp with a dry finish... I'm not an expert on sours or anything but this is amazing... There's quite a bit going on behind the curtain of sourness present and it changes all the time.. Very very nice...
I really loved this brew a lot... If this was available here, I'd always have some for sure... Its all I was hoping it would be... Better than Supplication which is the only other RR sour that ibe had... Was sad to see this 375ml bottle go...

Poured into an Urthel tulip glass. A deep red in color, not quite as dark as but definitely resembling a nice red wine. The smell is intensely winey and funky, the wild yeasts not being concealed in the slightest. The taste acidic, sour and funky, with the currants coming through. Very carbonated, fairly light mouthfeel considering the 10% ABV. I can easily put back more than a few of these, and have done so in the past.
Overall, this is one of my favorite beers and definitely my favorite sour ale. It's a little pricey here in Philadelphia, but it's worth every penny. 603 charactersFeedbacker, Nov 08, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I received this particular bottle (004x002) in a trade some time ago, and I had been waiting for a good enough reason to drink it... I figured that celebrating a night when I knew I could sleep in until 9:00 AM the next day was worth drinking it for. Review is from notes taken on 11/4/2010 and poured from the bottle to a tulip.
Appearance: This beer opens to a huge pop -- pours a coppery/mahogany color and starts with a one finger, off-white head that fades quickly to nothing other than a few thin wisps that seem to slither around the surface, caused by the carbonation bubbling up from beneath; body is quite clear and shows plenty of carbonation; a couple of lone spots of strands of lacing are left behind along with an oily residue.
Smell: Wonderfully tart and sweet at the same time - smell is reminiscent of cherry, but also has some of the label-mentioned currants as well; bit of a sour, brett funkiness; slight hint of oaky vanilla in the back as well; the sourness becomes much more present as it continues to warm.
Taste: Wow. This beer is pretty amazing; lots of very tart fruity aspects that make me pucker immediately, yet soothes very quickly; a smooth oakiness with a sweet lingering hint of vanilla to it lies underneath; the funk present in the nose is not especially perceptible in the mouth; this beer is reminiscent of red wine in the finish with a bit of a lingering sour aftertaste; for being 10%, the alcohol is really undetectable.
Mouthfeel: Body is of medium weight and it is slick and oily on the palette; leaves a thick, sticky coating on the roof that is counteracted by a strong mouthwatering sensation caused by the sourness and carbonation -- really quite excellent; belly is left warm from the ABV and acidic sourness.
Drinkability: Definitely a bit of a rare treat here -- glad I've got a 750 mL bottle stashed away still for another special occasion; amazing beer, but at 10% and a higher acidity, I do feel it is good in drinkability, but not great. 1,997 charactersbamadog, Nov 06, 2010

A hazy dried blood redish brown with an off white fizzy head that disappears quickly. Not an attractive beer. Smell is sour fruit, cherry pits, sugary sour candy, a hint of wine oakiness and funk. Taste is not nearly as complex as the smell - sour grapes at first, followed by a hint of alcohol and some wet oak. Mouthfeel is puckering at first, light body with prickly carbonation and a dry finish. Pretty drinkable, though not the best batch of consecration I have had. 518 charactersnkersten, Nov 03, 2010

A - Transparent ruby red with a white ring around the glass.
S - That funk nose of brett and slight vinegar.
T - Right away this is more fruity than I recall. Currants, maybe but the citrus really stands out. Wood and dry tartness in the back. At 10% you don't get any of the ABV.
M - Highly carbed, light on the palate but dry and tart.
D - Fruity but tart. A very solid Wild, one of the best I've had. Sharing a bottle is probably a very good idea.
I'm still trying to get my palate for wilds but this one is right up there all the other wilds I've had, tart, dry and fruity. 645 charactersboomer31, Nov 03, 2010

T - Much the same as the taste really. An amazing blend of flavours.
M - You can feel the prickling acidity on your tongue - wow. Takes the award for the lightest body beer with the highest flavour I've ever had.

8 oz into a snifter. This is a medley of the gods. Yes, there are currants here, but there is so much more, and it is hardly about the fruit so much as about the magnificence of of the blend. Sharply sour, there is a slight fruit funk to it but blending in well with the minimal malt presence. 
The clear amber looks absolutely glorious in the glass, sturdy and lovingly giving its all to you, astute beer drinker. Smells and tastes sharp and slightly fruity, currants. An absolute treasure, a pleasure. It rips its flavor into your throat, forcing you to appreciate or die trying. The alcohol comes out a bit but the sour dominates the profile. This is a magical beast, worthy of all praise. 719 charactersdragonWhale, Nov 01, 2010

Batch 002X003 poured into a Delirium snifter with a color of dark cherry wood with brighter shades of red when held to the light. Loose tan head that is gone in a flash with little lacing. Smells of yeast, must and horse blanket. Lots of wood, cherry and vinous aromas, too. Taste is a wonderful blend of oak and sweet fruits with a tart lemon flavor, like a good red wine but with a sour twist. Not anywhere near overly tart or overly sweet, the two are in perfect balance. Subtle grain characteristic in the background. Clean on the palate with no real lingering tastes. Medium carbonation with a light body that has a sweet flavor but a dry and puckering finish. Drinks surprisingly easy for a 10% ABV beer. I will have to trade for more of this and try it fresh too. 835 characterskbanks13, Oct 31, 2010

Tart, funky tones, with oak and yeast on the nose. Well carbonated which balanced the alcohol and tart, sour characteristics. I could feel the alcohol going down my esophagus which was pretty warming. Some flavors of oak and wild yeast which was noticeable but not as smooth and tart/sour as I would hope. And the currants were very subtle and in the background mostly and a little in the finish. 490 charactersboMD, Oct 27, 2010

First beer that I'd serve in a proper (read: good) wine glass. And that's how I do.
Just all around excellent with pronounced vinous qualities and aggressive but evolving and complex character. Not as seductive as the Temptation, nor as drinkable, but certainly better than the Supplication which lacks the charm of the former and the strength of this.
Ruby crimson appearance with very active effervescence. Small bubbles.
Smells of hide and the barrels it was aged in. Oak, Northern California Cabernet. New shoes and old cars. Dried tart cherries. Pedro Ximenez sherry.
Feels very crisp in the mouth, which suits this as it could become too intense without the refreshment. I've heard this element of this beer criticized, but I think that it is a good fit here. Refreshing. Pierces the cheeks and a hint of sharpness on the tongue.
Taste is extravagant. Fruit up front, with cherry and currant being predominant. Grapey on the back palate. Earthiness and woodiness weave through.
Very drinkable. Can and have sipped this for hours. The effervescence and tartness pace the consumption, and the quality keeps you coming back for more. 1,150 charactersoregone, Oct 26, 2010

A: A dark brown with little clarity (same color as the bottle its sold in). There is a half inch ring of head with around the outer ring of my glass and some whispy trails of bubbles through the middle. The Duvel D at the bottom of my glass is creating a swirl of carbonation in the middle that makes the bubbles look like clouds of a hurricane. 
S: Acidic sour, some cherry "tang", as well as some earthy oak notes. 
D: Sour vinegar with a hint of tartness, slight earthy flavor on the finish. Like the Cabernet barrels the beer is aged in it has a similar finish, earthy and puckering. Sour not dry. 
M: Slick, lightly carbonated mouth.
D: I enjoyed this beer and the fact that it really resembled a wine, minus the carbonation. I would gladly have another but for the ABV which at 10 is very high. While I don't notice the alcohol presence in the taste or scent I am sure I will feel it after my first glass. 936 charactersSiepJones, Oct 25, 2010
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I forget who brought this to the Toledo tasting(sorry guys), but so glad after I tried it the first time to get a hookup from a friend to have it again. Notes are pretty recent.
The color is beautiful, ruby-red verging on mahogany that shines in the light. A light brown head with good retention sits a little more than a finger high,leaving moderate lacing.
This one has the vinous and tart characters of a good red wine with lots of sour-sweet cherry(bing, if I had to describe it) and an oak character. It even seems like there are some tannins in here contributing a leathery character as in some red wines. I have to wonder how they do that. There a touch of balsam that leaves a vinegary reminiscence without going too far.
This is like tart, tannic sour cherries maturing in leather-lined oak barrels in my mouth. Clean, tart and dry. Acidic without melting my teeth and rounded out by a soft note of dark chocolate? This remains malty as well, somehow.
The feel is dry, but almost verging on semi-dry, likely from the malts that also add a touch of body, which is light to medium. The finish leaves a nice oak dryness.
This is as drinkable as an ABV of 10% or above could be. 1,184 charactersBrenden, Oct 21, 2010

A- Nice bronze/cherry hue, very clear with pretty much no head which is expected. Very good looking brew.
S- Very sour smelling with a faint hint of fruitiness. Hard to pick out one exact smell though, pretty much just smells like sourness, crisp.
T- Pucker up, this one packs a punch that rivals warhead sour gum. Good clean dry finish, very crisp with some pommegranite lightly in the background.
M- Once again, very clean and dry. Similar to champagne with dryness.
Overall it's an excellent beer that provides that perfect sourness. 596 charactersPipmeister, Oct 20, 2010
4.41/5  rDev 0%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412.68 ounce caged and corked bottle. Batch 004X4.
Pours a reddish-brown color with little to no head, but very active carbonation throughout.
The smell is overwhelming, right out of the bottle. Hints of tart dried fruit, cranberry, oak, vanilla, clove, hazelnut, cinnamon, and some funk. There is so much going on in the aroma here...
This is a sour beer...very sour...but perfectly so. The dominating flavors are of a cranberry tartness and and an oaky vanilla. There is a dryness to it, with some good, balanced alcohol burn. Everything seems well-balanced in this beer. There are also hints of clove, cinnamon, dry white wine, candy sugar, plums, and cider.
Overall, this is one of the best tasting, balanced sours I have ever had. The aging in Cabernet Sauvignon oak barrels, coupled with the addition of currants (and perhaps lactic acid or Brett) makes this a beautifully crafted beer. 895 charactersmovingtrain, Oct 19, 2010

A: Medium brown with ruby red. one finger off white head that fades supper fast into nothingness. No lacing.
S: There's a lot of sweet fruit smells in this beer. It is intense smelling, pleasant, and complex. There's tart cherry smell, a little cinnamon, some alcohol at the finish. To me this smells a lot like Wisconsin Belgian Red actually, but with a little bit more funk perhaps. I don't get much oak for this being oak aged.
T: Unfortunately this beer smells much better than it tastes. It's pretty one-dimensional in terms of the sweet fruits. Also, I feel that the high level of carbonation masks the flavors
M: This beer has a very high level of carbonation and is definitely on the thin side. Both of which are appropriate for the style, but also large in part define the beer. Nice aftertaste.
D: For a 10% ABV beer, the ABV is undetectable and the beer goes down easy. The drinkability is somewhat limited by the high carbonation in my opinion, as I feel that if I drank this too fast or in too high of quantity I would get the hiccoughs or an upset stomach. Overall, an interesting beer though, that I am glad I got the opportunity to try. If I was blind folded though, you'd be hard pressed to convince me this wasn't champagne. 1,333 charactersglazeman, Oct 16, 2010

Poured a new 375ml into my Dogfish Head snifter. Fairly positive its the first batch in the new 375's but I have already recycled the bottle without looking at it. This beer pours a prune brown with just a hint of a tan head that leaves no lacing. Very little carbonation leaving no bubbles. The aroma is extremely fruity. Tart organic cherry juice with prunes and dates mixed with just a hint of fresh oak. It terms of tartness, most of it seems to coming from a lactic twang. The flavor is much the same. Sour cherry juice dominates the flavor profile. Hints of fig and date come thorough behind the cherry. Oak comes through at the very tail of the profile. Major lactic acid presence. It really feels one dimensional. This is really one of those beers that no matter how dirty your teeth are, they come out feeling clean. The mouthfeel is very full for a sour. Really enjoyable. It really feels full on the palate and finishes extremely dry. Great. I've been lucky enough to have every batch of Consecration. While it is a good beer, I dont think its in the realm of Russian Rivers other sours or in the top echelons of American Wilds. 1,227 charactershwwty4, Oct 13, 2010

S- The nose is laced with aromas of cherry and a heavy musty phenolic. The nose is somewhat simple until the beer warms... where a number of malty, vinous and dark fruit esters emerge.
T- In the mouth it's a complete rollercoaster. It starts out with some sweet crystal malts, which are met with some dark fruit esters. On the mid-palate, some mild hop bitterness is met with a moderate lactic, slightly acetic sourness, which builds tremendously with a kick of savory melanoidin and an echo of oak in the finish. Lingers incredibly on the tongue. The dynamic range of this beer is incredible!
M- Medium body accentuated by a very soft, delicate carbonation. There's a mild to moderate astringency there, that works well for the style. A little slick oily texture there. Wonderful.
D- So incredibly dynamic. And the EtOH is SOOO well-hidden, it's amazing! 1,039 charactersjgasparine, Oct 13, 2010

The carbonation never quits moving, leading me to believe that this beer is still alive. Aromatics are so deep with vinous tones in this case it seems to be currants added to the mix for the super fruitiness. Batch # 004X3 weird stuff that keeps giving off a wonderful nose. Hints of sherry vinaigrette blowing off the rapid bubbling head, mild cider notes with wild funky tones that could only be dreamt about if your not drinking this wild ale...horse blanket barnyard doesn't even do it justice. Flavor hits you with a blast of oak with tart fruits galore seems like currants are the victim once again. This beer dares you to keep drinking it make sure your immune system is up to par it hit's with a very acidic tartness that's probably not healthy for your digestive tract unless your consuming this regularly. If Vinnie just all about vomit acid inducing sour ales I've gone too far, but so far his Damnation was the best American brewed Belgian anything that I've tried thus far. I guess it's a question of do you really like sours? I do...it's so different from your average brew out there this wild fermentation really peaks my interest even if it ends in a sour vinegar lactic pedio WTF? 1,309 charactersWVbeergeek, Oct 12, 2010

Appearance: Dark brown with a thin ring of head, much dark than the batch 3 which a friend was drinking.
Smell: Funk, pinot noir, strong wine aroma.
Taste: Holy sour. Tart cherries, strong bitter sour flavor with a slightly subdued Brett character coming through.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied.
Drinkability: One of the readily available (seasonal or when they release it at least) Russian River sours. I really enjoy this beer and get it whenever I see it on tap. 502 charactersAxic10, Oct 12, 2010

served on tap at Monk's Belgian Cafe in Philadelphia, PA
Appearance: Dark brown, small head, and good lacing.
Smell: Whoa! Cabernet wine and oak
Taste: Like wine- grape, sweet-tart, and a sourness.
Mouthfeel: Medium
Overall:
Sour beers aren't really my forté, but this tasted like wine and sweet-tarts. It was odd and flavorful. It was also a tad too sweet for my taste. 404 charactersmegahurts4, Oct 10, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance - Poured slowly into an oversized red wine glass to keep the extra yeast in the bottle. The head was extremely alive during the pour (think alka-seltzer) then quickly dissipated to nothing. Color is a cloudy mahogany.
Smell - Dark fruit and slightly jammy sour red wine.
Taste - Initially tastes like sour fruit which moves on to dry champagne and has a lasting crisp tart finish. Farther into the glass, the taste adds some raspberry qualities. Alcohol is hidden and unobtrusive. Has more depth than the other Russian River sours.
Mouthfeel - Has a light champagne tingly mouthfeel.
Drinkability - A good sipping ale but hard to put down. Has a funky wine vibe going on. 686 characterskazmaniac, Oct 09, 2010

A - short lived half inch of loose bubbly, tan colored foam which settles to a thin film and ring within a minute or so. the beer is very dark amber, almost purple in color.
S - slightly vinegar-like sourness, strong scent of oak, vanilla, and ripe berries for sweetness. finishes up with some dark fruit, light spice, and basement mustiness. 
T - begins with a flash of sweetness: berries, cherries, oak and vanilla before a massive sourness kicks in. slightly vinegary, very acidic and a bit vinous - reminiscent of purple sweet tarts. finishes with some lightly toasted nuts, oak, and just a tiny bit of funky yeast.
M - medium bodied for the style, with just about perfect lively prickly carbonation. very dry, in a pleasant sort of way which works very well with the ample sourness. mouth is left feeling a bit sticky and hairy, with lingering oak and sour fruits.
D - well, it certainly hides its very dangerous ABV quite well. also, this will be the third 750 i've polished off on my own, so i cant complain about the drinkability. where it lacks in subtlety it makes up for it with a clean and sharp mouthfeel and an old fashioned sour beatdown. was fortunate to pickup a case of this awhile ago - they will find a good home. 1,308 charactersStigs, Oct 09, 2010

Light brown / auburn pour with a very short lived white head. No lacing. God awful funk smell, reminicent of rotten berries and old fruit - but in a good way. Taste is a lingering sour tart funkiness, mouth coating and pervasive. Very nice carbonation, which once settled, lends itself to a smooth sipping pleasure. Alcohol only becomes appearant toward the end. Drinkability in this portion is fine, but a large bottle would approach Cantillon level difficulties. This is a grand beer, meant to be shared or greedily hoarded. Entirely your decision. I wish I lived in CA. 641 charactersOnibubba, Oct 08, 2010

4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The last of the bottles I brought back from my honeymoon in Portland.
750 ml bottle poured in a tulip.
Pours a dark brown/amber. Nice and foamy thick head, about two inches. Cork popped pretty hard when I opened it. Could see a little bit of moisture around the cork, I think it must have vented just a little.
Smell is heavenly. Very tart and sweet, floral, hints of oak and cherries.
Taste is all sour to begin, but is quickly followed by sweet fruit flavors, cherries, currants, grapefruit, and apples.
Excellent beer. Wish it was readily available in Illinois. 569 charactershopjuicer, Oct 07, 2010

375 ml. cork & cage, poured into an oversized wine glass.
Appearance: Bottle opens with a pop, pours out hazy dark and amber with a fizzy off-white head of foam that quickly dies down into a solid ring of lace around the edge of the glass.
Odor: Currants show a nice varied aroma, throwing fresh, sweet cherry, tart wine grape aromas. Nose is full, luscious and hints at an aggressive, sour beer.
Consistency: Tart, juicy, solid, highish carbonation takes the edge off the sourness ever so slightly. Pucker up.
Taste: The nose, once again, knows. Incredibly complex set of well-layered flavors going on here. Tart/sour lactic currant with an earthy underbelly of funk. Barrel, hints of dark malt and residual wine flavors derived from the barrel show up to the party. Finish shows more tart juiciness, some fruity alcohol shows its weight and warms the cheeks a bit.
Believe it. 940 charactersWalken, Oct 07, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter on 10/4/10
Batch 002x1
Pours a murky shade of brown; it kind of looks like pond water. Once settled in the glass it's more of a ruby hue, similar to grape juice. I was able to get 1/4th inch of loose, bubbly foam. The head dissipated rapidly, eventually leaving a thin collar. No lace at all nor head retention by the end.
Smells plenty sour & very acidic; certainly lactic. Vinous aroma of Cabernet Sauvignon bleed & the currants. To that end there's a musty oak note, as well. A decent Brett funk is buried in the back. Mild overtones of alcohol heat. Warmth brings out the grimier, funky aromas.
A puckering, sour kick is the first flavor to drop; bleeding down the peripheries whilst a dirty, barnyard funk fills in the center. The funk & musty oak barrel flavors become more appreciable with warmth. Dark fruit ester overtones. It's pretty dry, especially toward the finish. The sourness does mellow a tad over time, though not by much.
Basically full bodied; maybe slightly toward toward medium on the overall spectrum. Carbonation is moderate; it's enough to keep things moving without overpowering the sourness. Musty oak & a slow, dry finish. Alcohol is very well hidden.
Drinkability is quite good; definitely an enjoyable sour. I like the progression as it warms with the emergence of more prominent funk notes. I like Supplication a little better, but I wouldn't have any qualms revisiting this one. 1,439 charactersRyan011235, Oct 06, 2010

A: Pours a very dark purple with ruby highlights and a small fuzzy head they managed to stay put for most of the session.
S: Cherry "Sour Patch Kids" with a refreshing filtered water scent.
T: Matt warmed me that my jaw would lock then retract upon first sip and he wasn't kidding....that is a large part of the beer's charm! I got some of the same flavors that were in the nose, along with an awesome yeasty aspirin or sour "Flintstone vitamin" quality. Complex!
M: The pucker factor is with this one, but only for a brief moment at the beginning before the lucious fruitiness takes over. As with most sours, the AVB detectability is nill IMO.
D: Very drinkable, but best enjoyed in small doses and I'm glad Matt was there to share it with me. 889 charactersChaney, Oct 05, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to IdrinkGas for the chance to try this. Poured from a 375 mL bottle into a snifter. Batch 004X4.
Appearance: Dark brown with a reddish hue. No head whatsoever on the pour. Lots of carbonation on the pour. 
Aroma: Lots of barnyard funk right off the bat. The sour element is defintiely there, but it is balanced nicely by some fruitiness. 
Taste: The sour hits hard upfront. Currants and grapes add the fruit element here. Everything is in really good balance with the barnyard notes from the yeast. Nice, clean finish.
Mouthfeel: Heavy carbonation that becomes less as this sits. Light body, with a slightly dry finish.
Drinkability: At 10% ABV and with all the flavors in here, this is definitely a sipper. For a sipping beer though, I could enjoy sipping on this all night.
Overall, a really great wild ale and one that deserves all its recognition. Highly recommended. 889 charactersGosox8787, Oct 03, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375 mL bottle courtesy of Elendinn. Thanks man!
A- Red wine in color with a fizzy white head. This dissipates pretty quickly however.
S- Sour, with substantial Brett funk. Again, wine comes to mind, as the nose is fruity and acidic.
T- Sour and funky up front with nice fruitiness. Admittedly, I'm not familiar with currants, so I can't pick out specifics, but the fruit comes through nicely. Finishes with an interesting buttery vanilla sweetness that really pulls everything together.
M/D- Nice, champagne-like carbonation and very well-hidden alcohol make this pretty drinkable for the style.
A very nice wild ale. I think I prefer Supplication, but this is also very good. 681 charactersgeryeb624, Sep 26, 2010

Batch# Brew Date Bottle Date 	
004x3 3/25/2009 2/4/2010 
Pours a hazy, dark, ruby without any head or lace but there is noticeable carbonation. There are a few dark yeast particles sitting at the bottom of the glass.
The smell is a pleasant, cider vinegar aroma. Also, a red wine/grape element.
The taste is very acidic at first bite. Next I get oak, then a vinous quality and a light bit of funk. It has an enjoyable complexity in the taste and that lingers in the mouth.
Mouthfeel is medium thin.
Drinkability: The alcohol content shows itself pretty quickly yet you barely notice it. It's a very tasty, serious drinking beer that I like to drink slowly to savor the taste. I've had this many times on draft and can find bottles without a great deal of trouble when released. Philly has a good beer thing going. 845 charactersmeatyard, Sep 26, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed with TCGoalie, zoso1967, and TCHopCraver. We split a 750ml bottle between the four of us. Thanks to TCHopCraver for supplying the beer.
Appearance: Poured into a large wine glass. Color is an amber/straw with a one-finger head and minimal lacing. Quite a bit of carbonation is visible in the glass. Retention is not stupendous, but agitating the glass easily stirs up bubbles again. Yeasty chunks collect at the bottom of the glass.
Smell: A sour cherry smell dominates the nose, with a tinge of yeast and mustiness also present. There is also a bit of an acidic/mineral quality (almost like well water with too much iron). Other aromas are citrus, banana, and a touch of alcohol.
Taste: Sour bomb. Cabernet shines through and acidity abounds. The iron character I detected in the smell is there in the taste as well. Picking up a lot of tannins from the wine, which certainly adds to the mouth-puckering intensity of this beer. Given the aroma, I thought there would be more sweetness, but I think whatever sweetness there is has been lost amongst the sea of tartness.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, mouth-puckering tartness, and a dry finish. Clean and invigorating for the senses.
Drinkability: Probably a one-glass brew, but I will definitely revisit this one, as the experience is incredibly unique. 1,312 charactersBuckyFresh, Sep 25, 2010
3.79/5  rDev -14.1%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5First of two 375ml's purchased in Philly last week. The other one is staying in the cellar for a couple years. Batch 004x1, which according to Russian River's website, means this was brewed 3/25/09, and bottled 2/2/10.
Pours a see-through brown, an off-white head quickly fizzles away to a thin ring. Some sediment floating about. No lacing.
Big amount of sweaty funky aromas, cherry and red wine notes, green apple.
Lots of red wine and barrel tastes, sour red grapes. Very prominent oak/wood tastes, funk and barnyard. The fruit is stronger as it warms. Some alcohol here and there. I wasn't very impressed at first but it grew on me enough to give it a 4 for taste about halfway through. 
Carbonation is on the high side, feels a bit thin and boozy. A long, dry, sour finish.
Pretty good but underwhelming, definitely not in the league of Supplication or Temptation in my opinion. 888 charactersChico1985, Sep 24, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Reviewed from notes on 8-21-10. Split 750 mL 4 ways with TCGoalie, zoso1967, and BuckyFresh.
A: Pours a ruby-raspberry red with a white to khaki hued, one finger head. The lacing is excellent, highlighted by clumpy chunks of foamy head. A very sizzling effervescence from the carbonation is pleasing to my eye. A surprised face is staring at me from the good head retention. 
S: A sour, yeasty, and cherry aroma combination greets my nostrils. Some hints of banana bread and lemon zest are also evident. This is not a huge aroma, but the Cabernet Sauvignon oak barrel aging is more and more apparent with deeper inhales, and even more so as the beer warms. 
T: As soon as Consecration hits my lips, the tartness of the beer explodes onto my palate. So very sour... but an iron and earthy bitterness is ever present, as well. The cherry and cabernet tastes are well blended with the wild yeasts to create a huge and explosive flavor. Every time I take a sip, my eyes just fly open from the tartness of this brew.
M: The sides of my palate are just bombarded with a puckering sourness that quickly spreads to the rest of my mouth. This is a phenomenal, wild, tart attack on my mouth - I love it. A nicely dry finish leaves my palate quite clean. 
D: I will certainly seek this out again and be very excited to imbibe it. I did split this four ways, though, and that is about all that my mouth could handle in a sitting. Russian River, wow. Another great brew. 1,462 charactersTCHopCraver, Sep 20, 2010

Pours dark red with very little head, looks very inviting. Smells very sweet and sour. The taste is a complete explosion of fruity sourness and sweetness. I'm not sure what exactly i'm tasting, all i know is that it is strong and i like it. My mouth was a little dry afterward but not much more than other beers. Even though this beer is incredibly sour, i found myself ordering more than one in a row, so i would say the drinkability is pretty good. Definitely a sipping beer, but still amazing overall.
Long story short: buy it and drink it. 729 characterslocalhost, Sep 20, 2010

A- The color of this beer is basically the same color as the label. The carbonation fizzes up a head violently fast. It doesnt even get done gathering before its gone. No lacing, no head, not even any bubbles. Thats not always a bad thing when it comes to a sour though, I suppose. 
S- This is a good smelling beer though. Very acidic. Lots of vinegar that stings the nostrils. A healthy dose of horsey funk. A nice woodiness is also apparent. Red wine, currants and glue come in subdominately. 
T- Quite sour. The phrase "ass puckering" has been going around this site since Overlord coined it. Its beers like this that keep that phrase alive. Very acidic, one of the more acidic beers Ive tasted. Again, a considerable amount of funk. Lots of old, beat up oak barrel, and cellar door. Tartness that is akin to very under ripe berries. Wow this is strong on wood (to write in a very stream of conscience manner). Vinegar, unripe plum skin. Pretty aggressive.
M- Very biting. Very dry. It leaves a grape juice acidity in the mouth as it strips your palate bare. 
D- Very aggressive. I think I feel it trying to upset my stomach. I like it nonetheless. This beer will let you know what it thinks of you, and it doesnt think to highly of your attitude. 
This beer in one word: Rancorous. 1,390 charactersMbpBugeye, Sep 19, 2010

This poured a dark brown with a white head, it was sampled out of a tulip glass. The aroma was intensely sour with a lot of dark fruits mixed in. The taste was just an outright assault of sourness which I enjoyed very much. It was very aggressive while still having a nice balance between the sourness and the acidity. The body was very light, this didn't taste like a 10%abv beer. However, I don't see myself being able to have more than 2 of these since sour beers can tear apart the stomach after having too many. I could see this being too aggressive for some, those people would probably enjoy Supplication more since that was the more mellow of the two. 770 charactersjonvan04, Sep 18, 2010

I poured this into a tulip, just as Russian River instructs me to. The pours is lively! Fizzy and awesome with a small head the does quite the vanishing act. It's here then gone! The body looks stellar, a beautiful dark cherry red with lots of lively carbonation. Smells sour. I like it! It starts with a sour cherry with a bit of vinegar; oak aromas with nice earthiness. This smells a bit funky with a sweet finishing aroma. I'm down with this. Tart right out of the gate! This is great, oak and earthy flavors with tart and sweet cherries. This has some solid funkiness to it. This is really well balanced, it's not overly tart and the mild sweetness is a welcome finish. The mouthfeel is nice, a bit drying to the end but the light body and the carbonation makes this really enjoyable. I could drink this all the time. I get a bit of heat from alcohol but this is so good I don't even care. It's easy to drink and this glass is lasting me a while. This is a really nice sour and I will certainly be seeking out more. 1,113 charactersBendurgin, Sep 12, 2010

T-Immediately sour, tangy, and out right funky. In a good way of course. Vinegar and sour apples show up again in the taste Along with some tart cherries and currants.

Light brown color with a thin head that quickly disappears. Very little lacing is left on the glass. The appearance was not really a disappointment considering the style. Wonderful aroma of wild funkiness, leather, grapes, currants, and wine. The finest tasting sour/wild ale I have drunk. Plenty of lip puckering sourness but it does not interfere with the subtle fruit and malt notes. The currants are tasted but they definately play a supporting role. This beer seems to be perfectly blended and balanced. Light body with crisp carbonation that seems well suited to the flavor. With the ABV way up there, it limits drinkability but the 375ml bottle seemed like the perfect serving size. 702 charactersmorimech, Sep 10, 2010

It pours with a super fizzy head that dissipates within a second and leaves no lacing. The beer is a hazy reddish plumb color with hints of brown.
It has a pungent smell. There is some red wine smell along with a huge whiff of oak. There is also some sour currant and caramel. It is very sour and oaky smelling.
The taste is very reminiscent to a dark red wine. It is very vinous and tannic. The oak is milder in the flavor than it was in the smell. There is a slight funk note but the yeast is mostly sour. Not asspuckeringly sour but pretty nicely sour. Underneath everything there are traces of malts including the smallest hint of toastiness. It finishes with a dry grapeskin/seed flavor. As you go the subtly sweet currant flavor can be tasted in the back of the mouth along with some oxidized apple. 
The mouthfeel is pretty good for a sour. It is a tad thin but very dry and tannic in the finish. The alcohol surprisingly isn't totally hidden under the deep complexity though it never becomes overbearing.
Overall this is a nice sour. It is definitely one of the sourest beers I have had yet. 1,159 characterscrossovert, Sep 09, 2010

A. Pours with no head whatsoever. Pours a deep brown with amber/ruby when light shines through. Small occasional bubbles show that there is some carbonation in the beer, but very little.
S. Oak, sour, dark malt, some belgian candi sugar and yet a bit like a dry red wine.
T. Earthy leather and tobacco with fig. Funky sourness lies firmly on top of the flavor profile. Sour on swallow with a dry finish. 
M. Medium body with little noticeable carbonation.
D. This drinks more like a red wine than a beer. While that is partly due to the low carbonation the flavor profile also seems to align more with wine than beer. The high alcohol is hidden well under the complex flavors, but you probably wouldn't consume more than a glass with or after dinner. I appreciate that this beer maintains complexity where so many sour beers are one dimensional.
I've got one more bottle of this; I'll update if that one is more carbonated. 978 charactersBeerAndBourbon, Sep 05, 2010

No head retention, just a white ring around the side of the glass. Aroma is woody, earthy, with maltiness and a real dried fruit presence. Wine n grape notes really come through.

Malty n fruity with flavors of deep toasty malt and dried fruit, leather and earthy. Pretty tasty and drinkable, but I always think that about sours.

3.85/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Bought from a small beer store in Paulsbo, WA near Seattle. My first wild ale from Russian River, though I have been a fan of the sour wild ale style from Belgium for while. It's an attractive red, plum, amber color. Carbonation is fairly high and makes it looks just a bit like Dr. Pepper - but in a good way. The smell is really nice. Sour, cherries, alcohol, and a sweet/acid mix. The flavor is similar, but with more dark fruit, a bit of the cabernet and oak. I give it some minus-points because there is a bile-like quality as well that didn't sit well with me. Mouthfeel is nice and lively and it would be very drinkable for me if not for that bile-thing going on in the background. 688 charactersAaronHomoya, Sep 04, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a tulip from a 375ml bottle. 
Pretty strong pop from this bottle. Pours a nice garnet color with active carbonation and a nice .25 inch head. The head is thin and recedes quickly down to a ring. The color is very attractive. 
Tart cherry aroma with some slight vinous aroma and raisin characteristics. Slight syrup aroma as well with some medicinal esters. Nice vinous character with some good tart vinegar notes and mixed in some nice wood.
Intense cherry tartness to start off with some slight balsamic vinaigrette that moves in as well. The profile is very similar to the aroma. Slight phenols and a syrupy medicinal flavor. The beer is very complex even though it leans towards the sour side. A nice rich flavor with a present alcoholic warmth and sweetness that tries to offset the tartness. As the beer warms it becomes a bit sweeter with some nice berry flavors and eventually the woody flavors from the aging. I've just started to experiment with sour beers and I have to admit some I like better than others. This is a good example and not a bad one to get introduced to the different flavor spectrum. 
Delicious tartness with some great slight fruit sweet notes. The high ABV is nice and warming and lends the brew a richer note. 1,255 charactersJoEBoBpr, Aug 31, 2010

Pours a thin head at first, which quickly dies to a creamy ring around the edge of the glass. appearance is pretty decent, beer looks very nice with some back lighting, a burnt brown glow. smell is not what i expected (having no idea what to expect), and is FULL of rich butterscotch, caramel, and toffee. dome darker fruits come out as well (can't place specifics, but very sweet), and a rush of sour apples. damn great smell. taste follows suit, very sweet caramel toffee with some sweet malt. the sourness is not as intense as other RR offerings (it is still the main theme though!), but it actually complements the sweetness very well and doesn't overpower the rich flavor profile. mouthfeel is where this one falls a little short for me. it's a little thin, especially for a richer tasting beer. the carbonation was just a hair much, though not distractingly so. the drinkability is good, balanced flavors and not tongue destroying sourness, and pretty light (see mouthfeel) 1,040 charactersridglens, Aug 30, 2010
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours like red sangria. Little bit a fizz on top. 
It's tamer than I thought it would be. Maybe 2-3 years ago, before the sour thing took off and every other American brewer was trying to out shocktart Shock Tarts, this would have been shockingly sour. I was expecting something shockingly sour. But, really, that's my fault, not the beer's.
The sour isn't intense and the fruit isn't candied or Starbursty. But the sour is still there, and the fruitiness isn't like regular ripe fruit even though it's also not like any candied or synthetic fruit, nor even like any other wild ale I've ever had. It's vinous, with burny nodes of red wine barrels in the back end, but mostly it's just very delicately fruity and sour. 
This is exquisitely brewed. This is the kind of beer that can (and did) help set off a national trend. 824 charactersmynie, Aug 28, 2010

The pour is a dark reddish hue mixed with a good deal of brown. The head appeared brownish then faded to white. Agitating this beer will manually create more head. When swirling the glass, splotchy bubbles gather across the glass and collect in mild lacing.
The smell yields a subdued cherry tartness, woody oak, caramel, banana, and lemon.
The taste is quite tart with lots of sour iron like feel. Further in the taste is more sour with a cigar/tobacco like aftertaste. There are also some spicy, peppery notes.
The mouthfeel is light and refreshing and certainly gets my saliva glands going. A nice drying finish concludes this rarity.
This is a solid drink. It is so sour that I want more to believe how sour it is. 860 charactersTCgoalie, Aug 28, 2010

750 ml bottle obtained via trade with craytonic; thanks, Matt!
Poured into Allagash chalice.
A: Pours a deep russet-brown with a champagne-like head that dies down just as fast. Settles with no head whatsoever. Completely opaque and mysterious.
S: Smells just like I thought it would - vinegar, tart apples, a hint of red grape and oak. If the smell of a wild ale could ever truly be balanced, ever balanced, this would be it.
T: Beautiful. Sour upfront, yet the finish kicks in fast and mellows everything out. Flavor profile is so complex that I don't know where to start - vinegar, bright fruit, citrus, vanilla. This is beautiful.
M: Carbonation is medium-high, yet flattens quickly. Overall, this is a fairly toothsome beer that goes down like silk.
D: This is my first offering from Russian River, and I couldn't be more impressed. I could likely drink 2 bottles of this.
Looking forward to more Russian River after a splendid first experience. 1,004 characterssk8man121, Aug 28, 2010

A - A lovely copper brown color with golden hues and barely any head or lacing. 
S - Remarkably cherry and tart, along with some hints of alcohol and red wine. 
T - Highly sour and acidic up front, but the sweeter currant flavors quickly balance the taste before an amazingly unique wine flavor starts to kick in. Smacking of dark fruit, oak, and red wine, the ale quickly warms you as the 10.5 abv is almost nonexistent until finally creeping in towards the finish, creating a rush of boozyness which isn't overwhelming.
M - Bubbly, sticky, tart, and dry. 
D - Possibly one of the easiest drinking wild ales I've ever had, especially at 10.5%. You can sense the alcohol in the finish, but it's tough to only have one, especially on tap. 
These are expensive, and worth every penny. Absolutely delicious, refreshing, vibrant, exciting, and pleasant to drink. I only wish we could get RR in NJ, but at least Philly is within striking distance. 996 charactersxnicknj, Aug 27, 2010

Appearance -- Pours garnet with amber highlights and minimal head. Just enough haze to catch light.
Smell -- Currant, tart berries, cider vinegar, vanilla, and canteloupe.
Taste -- Red wine vinegar, currant, and tart raspberry-like notes are most evident up front. Some cabernet is also noticable along with mixed berries, amber malt, and an earthy, vegetal bitterness. The oak barrel gives some woody astringency and vanilla flavor.
Mouthfeel -- Medium to light in body with ample prickly carbonation and mild astringency. A bit frothy toward the back-end. Dry finish.
Drinkability -- It's good, but I'm not in love. Probably due to my mixed feelings toward currants. I really had to give this beer a chance, but toward the end of my glass I was feeling okay about it. Still, I won't be actively seeking this out any time soon. 845 charactersyeahnatenelson, Aug 26, 2010

4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tried on tap at Monk's "Speakeasy" on Wednesday 8/18. Review from notes.
This highly sought after sour pours a reddish brown with amber hues and an impossibly deep body. Carbonation is modest, as is the head and lacing. Takes on a bronzy red wine vibe when held to the light. It's incredibly attractive and arousing.
Aromas are a Sour Patch Kids fan's dream come true. Vinegar, tart berry, a blanket of musk and a whiff of a brown ale's buttery notes are equally on display. The whole package is striking, as is the profound blast of sour that stings the nose from first sniff.
Flavor is like biting into a Warhead hard candy (in the best way). Face puckering sour cherries, Belgian brown ale malt, an oakey wood barrel musk and the fruity sweetness of a Flanders Red all perfectly round out the flavor. 
This is the best of the style (in my humble opinion) and I think the delicate balance is the reason. It moves so smoothly from tart blast to malt to musk without ever losing focus or leaning on the sourness as a crutch.
It's also criminally easy to drink for its bombastic 10%. It's even easier to consume on tap and (after trying it at a bar and from a bottle) it just feels so vibrant and flavorful right from the keg.
A must try! 1,243 charactersdeapokid, Aug 25, 2010

Pours a lusty and hazy ruby red with little to no head, though I poured it cold. Second pour yields a nice, short-lived three-quarter finger head. 
Sweet and tangy berries, sour cherries, a muted oakiness, major vinous notes. Fresh and bright aroma. On the palate, Consecration starts with the taste that's left on your fingers after picking blackberries, which is overcome by leathery and funky brett. Nicely blended, wonderful currant presence, and the Cabernet notes come through beautifully, but this vintage is heavy on a tobacco character I find distracting on the finish. 
Fairly light, with a dry finish. It's hard to think this is 10% ABV. 689 charactersVerecund, Aug 24, 2010

S - The aroma is that of the ultimate wild ale, a complex mixture of sourness, dried fruits, some wine like notes and certainly some oak as well. Not too sour in the smell but certainly inviting.
T - Wow. This beer is a flavor party in my mouth. There is some sourness, some sour grape notes that have mellowed, a strong sweetness and the currants in the aftertaste. An absolutely fantastic beer that every BA should try.
M/D - Mouthfeel is sharp from the sourness and has a bit of the feel of pop rocks. The flavor is so good that it's hard to keep it in the glass. This is exceedingly drinkable and overall an amazing beer. 775 charactersmwa423, Aug 23, 2010

The cork pops and dispenses an auburn liquid into my duvel tulip.
Black cherry, cola, damp earth, sweet oak, and sour acidity.
Dark cherry cola kicks things off, then a wave of cigar box, leather and malic acid reminscent of granny smith apples. Oak and a puckering tartness linger on the palate.
This one of those rare sours that displays a substantial level of sourness while still retaining a great deal of complexity. It doesn't just taste like cider vinegar, their is a lot going on here. 509 charactersBradLikesBrew, Aug 22, 2010

A - Bottle opens with a dull pop. Pours beautiful ruby brown, but very little carbonation apparent and no head. 
S - Bigger barrel character than I've ever noticed on this beer. Stone fruits, a bit of alcohol heat, and, I swear, some diacetyl. Comes across almost as butterscotch when taken in with the barrel character, but there is butter there. 
T - Tartness is most apparent, but not hugely sour. This is balanced by a complex sweetness including malt and stone fruits. Buttery character that I feared in the nose is found in the taste, as well. Leaves this bottling tasting sweeter than others I've had. No doubt the Brett needs to dry it up a bit and clean up the diacetyl thrown out by the Pedio.
M - Big and round. The alcohol is there in the finish, but is certainly not overpowering. 
D - For a 10% beer, I've always found this to be almost quaffable. Consecration has gotten me into trouble in the past, and if I had another 375 on hand, that would likely be the case again tonight. 
Overall: Wish I would have sat on this bottle for another 6 months, but if I had ordered this at a bar, I'd certainly consider ordering a second. Doesn't have the "jfc" factor of other versions I've had, but it's still a beautiful beer. 1,249 charactersSummitVA, Aug 22, 2010

Poured into my Russian River Goblet. Reddish caramel color. Pretty clear with tons of effervesence. 1 finger of thin soapy looking head that disappears rather quickly. 
A bit of dried fruit and vinegar with lots of wine characteristics. A small touch of alcohol on the nose with a real pleasant amount of funk. 
An initial touch of sweetness on the tongue gives way almost instantly to a mouth Pickering sourness. Lots of dark dried sticky fruit, leather, and funk. The wine barrel flavor definitely comes through as well. 
Mouthfeel is a bit acidic and very carbonated.

I have had consecration many times, every batch, and this is the first time I have tasted this. Not sure if it is a tap thing. I was not digging it.
Lots of carbonation with a very dry feeling.

A: Pours a dark, clear ruby-red color with lively fizzy carbonation that formed a short lived light brown wood colored head that quickly faded away into nothingness. No lace.
S: Wonderful smelling! Complex notes of black currants and tart black cherries mixed with a very vinous red wine like smell and musty oak and woody notes. Not much cheesy horse blanket to the nose, but there are a few hints of bacteria to let you know this beer is about to get exciting. Fruity sweet yet lightly sour smelling at the same time.
T: Oh yeah. Very complex, fruity, woody and funky flavors. This brew hits your mouth with sweet black cherries and currants and then light sour and funky notes take over until the finish. The aftertaste is full of oak tannins and earthy wine barrel flavors. Not a very sour beer at all but there are definitely some acidic notes in the finish. The sourness blends well with the sweet fruit and dry tannin flavors. 
M: Super dry wine-like tannins stick to your mouth as the medium-light body of this beer quenches your thirst as it washes down your throat. Very delicious and refreshing, and amazing for such high alcohol. Could use a little bit more carbonation though. After the pour this beer falls a bit flat. 
D: Super easy to drink. Very surprising for a sour ale and a beer with double digit alcohol. The light tartness, the sweet fruits, and refreshing mouth, most everything about this beer works. I was worried it might be too much, but I'm glad I have this whole bottle to myself. 1,565 charactersscottfrie, Aug 17, 2010

S: Wow, it packs a tart punch. I can pick up tart cherries and grapes paired with some funk and a definite oak backbone. Really intriguing.
T: Follows the nose almost exactly. Immediate sour and tart cherry notes. Funky Brett and oak follow, but don't completely take over. It all blends together pretty well. A definite bite from the alcohol is present in the finish, which is still just as tart as the start.
M: Loads of carbonation and a light body. Finishes like a dry wine.

M- well carbonated, great body. Balance is fantastic with the tartness.

4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a brown/magonnay color with a moderate cream head. Nose and aroma are layered with currants, funk, sourness and brett. Every flavor here has its moment, but they're all interwoven with the brett - it rarely takes a back seat. The vinegar:sour ratio is superb - it blasts you with sourness without causing you to wrinkle your nose from too much vinegar flavor. The alcohol blends in well - it's not absent, but it's also not hot or burning. It's woven perfectly into the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is great - no problems there.
This isn't the most sour beer I've ever had, and it isn't necessarily the tastiest either...but it blends the two masterfully. This is a phenomenal beer. The high ABV turns this into a perfect beer to sip over an evening. I only wish it was easier to obtain.
Absolutely a world class brew and one of the finest American wilds ever made. 870 charactersMavajo, Aug 13, 2010

Mouthfeel - Light medium-bodied with carbonation on the low end to perhaps medium. Fine bubbles. Very dry.
Drinkability - Quite drinkable and refreshing.
Overall - A very enjoyable sour, though I felt that this one could probably use some time in the bottle and the vinous notes were rather disappointing. I found Supplication to be markedly better,
though I'd like to try this one again with more patience and allow it to warm more (served at cellar temperature; did notice it improved as it warmed beyond that). 701 charactersAenema, Aug 12, 2010

Corked & Caged 375ml bottle BATCH: 004X1
This one is a crystal clear, medium shade of amber, with a light hint of pink tinting. An easy pour produces a massive head, not unlike you'd expect from champagne. It recedes fairly quickly, but not TOO quickly. No lacing to speak of. This is all according to style though, so let's carry on!
The scent of the currants comes through nicely. A touch of sweetness that blends with the otherwise tart scents that are dominating this nose.Nice hints of funky yeast notes. Wet hay and a touch of horse sweat. Dry oak notes. 
The character of the Cab Sauv barrels seems to shine through, quite nicely.
Big notes of tart cherries and a hint of currants blast your palate. The barnyard funk, combined with the oak, tend to dry things out a touch and keep the tartness from becoming too sour. There is a light touch of sweetness in the middle, but then it ends with a little sour touch again. A very good showing of lactic acid runs through the whole profile.
This is an extremely well done sour/wild.
Light-to-medium bodied with a high carbonation level. This allows it to be extremely crisp, smooth and refreshing.
The acidity would keep me from downing a ton of these in a single session. The flavor would make me want to try to though. The 10.00%abv is absolutely nowhere to be found within this brew, by the way.

A: Pours a dark reddish/brown color. A small white head forms, and recedes in a second. Light lace is left behind.
S: Sweet malt, and tart fruits. I don't get much else.
T: Very sweet and tart fruits. Kind of vinegary. Caramel apples. I enjoy the tartness, but overall there is not a lot here.
M/D: A medium body that is very crisp and perfectly carbonated. Not hard to drink, but not something I want to reach for again and again.
Not bad at all. I have had this many times, and it is about time to put my thoughts down. Very enjoyable, but Russian River have a lot better Wild Ales IMO. Still very much worth a try. 693 characterschamp103, Aug 09, 2010
3.04/5  rDev -31.1%look: 2 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5375ml poured into a flute - fridge - batch 004x4
Appearance: Pours a dark red, but mostly brown color with absolutely no head. This might be a bad bottle. It is a little cloudy but shows no other signs of life.
Smell: Medicinal, cabernet, currant and not much else. I suppose there is a little bit of tobacco.
Taste: Sticky sweet but also sour and acidic. A tart taste of currant and other dark fruits is met with that typical cabernet taste. Some wood and plenty of alcohol in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Very unlively, with no carbonation, but lots of flavor and wine inspiration. Medium to heavily bodied. Tart, acidic, sweet and woody.
Drinkability: This beer had so much hype around it that it pains me to begrudge it so much. It needs more attention to detail. Head, head retention, aroma, mouthfeel all need to be seriously reconsidered before releasing to the public. I feel like this beer was sold just to get it out of the brewery for some $$$. 954 charactersRisser09, Aug 08, 2010
4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my Sprecher snifter at fridge temp. Pours a clear, brown color with amber highlights. Grows a thin, fuzzy head, that disappears instantly.
The aroma has a very tart quality, almost like a dry white whine, but juicier, if that makes sense? A touch of vinegar, oak and some tart green fruit and some "cidery" character.
The flavor is quite intense, starting out with a sour balsamic vinegar note, leading into some tart cherry and oak flavors. the finish is sour...leaving a pretty nice, not-quite sweet, fruit flavor on the palate.
I've had this a couple times now and I really just love that acidic, balsamic vinegar character of the beer. The flavors are quite intense, and yet this beer isn't really a "palate destroyer" like IPAs/DIPAs. Ultimately, I could drink this ALL THE TIME if it were available in Wisconsin. As is, I'll just hafta enjoy the hell out of it when I can. 893 charactersSoneast, Aug 08, 2010

A - One fingers worth of audibly fizzy light to medium tan head fades away in rapid succession... Blink and you may miss it... Zero lacing or collar... A translucent rich medium ruby red color... Scattered moderate carbonation throughout can be seen bursting through the top... 
S - Exquisite and regal... Berries... Cherries, both sweet and tart... Cider like qualities... Touches of wood and leather... A very subtle hint of vanilla... Intoxicating.... 
T - Slightly tart fruit in the form of berries and cherries to start... Bursting with lactic acid... The pinot noir vinuous notes run a muck... A bit of funkiness... Quite intense... A bit of alcohol induced heat... 
M - Medium bodied... Heavy... Slightly syrupy and sticky... Puckering... Minimal carbonation... Prickly... On the dry side of the ledger... 
D - A serious sipper... The sour tartness is uber potent... Lots of depth and complexity... Teetering on overbearing... I really have mixed feelings on this after each sip... 1,049 charactersphilbe311, Aug 07, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Served on tap in a short snifter at a local bar. Due to poor lightning, I can't really comment on the exact color, but it was likely a very dark red. 
Smells of dried berries and sour funk, with a hint of oak. 
Taste of tart fruit right up front, but finishes smooth due to the oak. Lingers on the tongue with the currants and oak primarily, with the sour notes disappearing.
A very rich beer that coats the inside of your mouth if you swish it around. No carbonation in the glass that I had. 
Due to the intensity of the upfront sourness, it requires sipping. Took me an hour to finish a 10 oz glass as I was letting the flavors transform in my mouth with each sip, until it fades and I take yet another sip.
A very delicious beer. 737 charactersnataku00, Aug 06, 2010

Pours a deep reddish brown with a two finger off white head that subsides to one quickly. Lots of carbonation rising to the top and makes a fizzing like a soda. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of yeast, bread, sour apple, and grapes. The flavor is of sour apple, grapes, very subtle alcohol, and citrus. It has a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was the first Wild Ale I had tried back at a tasting and it got me interested in the style. This is a very nice blend of flavors all in one package that makes my taste buds jump for joy after every sip. If you have not tried any Wild Ales, this might be a good place to start. 770 charactersthagr81us, Aug 05, 2010
4.07/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Batch 004X4. Pours a half finger of off-white head (dirty tan?) over a murky ruby orange-rust liquid. Smells very odd. Brettanomyces, cherries, waxy wood, clean alcohol, mild chocolate, sting that comes across as peppery or ginger-like.
In the mouth, puckering dry and effervescent. Strong lactic tang, lemon, brett funk, white grape, mild acetic, and strong dry wood character. Think cherry balsamic vinegar meets fermented cherry pop-tart-filling 'gone wild'! The finish and aftertaste stings with acid and a very dry lingering cherry and lemon. Light body and very sharp carbonation. Typical american wild ale. 614 charactersmentor, Aug 03, 2010

A - Dark cherry colored red with a nice cherry glow. Tiny circle of off white head rests on top
S - Nice sour smell on the nose. A hint of soured grapes lies in there. The aroma makes me think this one is going to take advantage of my tongue and make me like it. Can really smell this one without swirling or sticking my nose close to it.
T - Definitely picking up the Cabernet barrels. A nice sour grape taste in there with a hint of the oak. Reminds me a lot of a nice Cabernet with a big hint of funk and a huge punch in the face of sour. This is a really good brew.
M - medium body with a nice hint of carbonation.
D - Really drinkable for the ABV and style. My girlfriend made a huge pucker face so I'm thinking these really punishing sours are a little easier for me to handle than most. I really enjoyed this and wish I could get more easily. Will definitely grab this again if I can. 945 charactersjpmclaug, Aug 03, 2010

Batch 004x1
A: Amber/Mahogany, bubbly. The etched "D" at the bottom of my Duvel tulip is having a field day. Never seen this thing work so hard. A little tornado in my glass. A thin white cap and a thick ring remains.
S: Red wine vinegar, lactic sour goodness, tinge of alcohol. Good, not terribly complex. 
T: Wow, lots of tannins. Really getting the Cabernet barrel and grapes. Mouth puckering sourness and vinegar once again. Not as lively as Supplication; fittingly "darker" all around and Im not just referring to appearance. 10% huh? I cant taste it. 
M/D: Prickly, medium bodied. I can feel the 10%, but I cant taste it, that must count for something. A top sour, just not as "vibrant" as some others I have had. 745 characterszoolzoo, Aug 03, 2010

Glassware: Portsmouth Tulip
Poured a ruby red in color, w/ no head, only a few bubbles on the outer edge, that left no lacing. The nose was of tart cherries, currants, funk, spices, and oak. Taste was amazingly tart, w/ notes of sour cherries, black currants, and oak. Mouthfeel was thin, but lush due to great carbonation. Drinkability was tremendous as most wild ales are.
Nice movie beer that I will most likely be drinking again very soon. 494 charactersmikeyv35, Jul 31, 2010

A - Pours a beautiful ruby red, and changes colors colors to amber, mahogany and purple depending on its angle to direct light. A thin tan head has little retention that clings to the outside of the glass with numerous streams of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. A wee bit of lacing after each sip.
S - Very vinous-like character up front with a bit of sour cherry tartness on the back end.
T - Follows the nose a bit, but the oak aging really comes through nicely. Sourness is just a little tart in the first few sips, but then really packs a punch by the end of the glass.
M - Medium body, high carbonation, super dry finish, with sourness accumulating after each sip. Nice warming character from the booze by the end.
D - My first wild ale, and I am certainly impressed. Alcohol presence is hidden extremely well. Very complex, well balanced. 891 charactersgaruda, Jul 30, 2010

A - Great looking brown/reddish body deep in color.
S - Smelled sweet and sour, fruity and delicious.
T - Alot of fruity wine flavor on the palate. This one is sour, dry and delicious. Semi sweet with some citrus and slight warming alcohol.
M - Moderately carbonated and so smooth and soft. Very crisp taste and mouthfeel makes this one enjoyable. Dry and sour/sweet through the whole sip.
D - This beer was incredibly tasty and crisp and refreshing. To me that makes it very easy to drink. The alcohol wasnt overwhelming.
Notes - First time I had this beer and it was fantastic. Had it along with the Charcouterie platter full of meat, cheese and fruit and paired nicely. 695 charactersBeerForMuscle, Jul 29, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Russian River (and then at Toronado - twice).
A - Light brown, with a fair amount of red when held in the light. There's a fair amount of off-white head and a substantial bit of lacing develops as the minutes pass.
S - Funky yeast and red wine are evident right away. Vinegar is also accessible, as is the essence of summer fruits.
T - Chocolate-covered cherries strike first, with a punch of citrus bitterness (yet not due to hops) afterward. The middle is more of the latter - lemons in droves with lime and cranberry. The back half is brett-ified, palpable funkiness, with notes of raspberries and dried montmorency cherries.
M - Like velvet - medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and ultra-smooth.
D - Again, smooth. Utterly drinkable, with well-hidden alcohol.
What a beer - there's nothing left to say. 822 charactersklikger, Jul 28, 2010

A-pours a flat looking reddish copper color that is quite clear and has virtually no head.
S-the nose is very big, lots of vinous red wine characteristics with a faint earthy tone to it. very little oak with the sweet currant in the back. just a hint of acidity in the back but light.
T-nicely balance, sweet red wine, dark red grapes, nice sourness to it, hints of oak underneath. tart cherries and currants add sweetness to it with a light spice in the back.
M-this has a smooth and medium body with huge carbonation and a crisp dry finish. very nice feel to it!

By the time it was served to me there was no head. Left no lacing. Dark cherry red. Really a beautiful looking brew.
Berry juices and lemonade to the nose.
Definitely get berry and fruit juices up front, later some wine characteristics. Then a bitter taste, like lemon juice. I was in awe after my first sip. Alcohol is hidden well, especially at 10%. Awesome.
Very carbonated, but man this beer is smooth. Could definitely slam the whole bottle. But might be in a little trouble. Will buy this again whenever I see it. Absolutely worth the money.

Poured a deep garnet with a quick, frothy head that fizzled in mere moments.
Smells of some dark berry juice, lemon spritzer and some fusel alcohol. 
Immediate pucker inducing lemon tartness with big juicy berry (having never had a currant, I'll have to assume that is what it is). Quick burst of effervescent fizz that delivers the berry wallop. The tartness and berry break down leaving some soggy wood that is a bit unpleasant. 
Overall this is a wonderful wild but I am still becoming familiar with the style. I'm not sure what is up with the finish but the rest of the beer is solid. 604 charactersLazerlobe, Jul 26, 2010

A- pours a dark reddish shade of brown with a half finger head that fades nearly instantly...I assume that is par for the course since I gave this an aggressive pour. Some of the head sticks around on the top of the glass and around the edges...it just LOOKS evil, like some sort of witches brew...god its awesome, constantly bubbling.
S- strong cherries with a bit of a tartness to them. Getting some of an aroma of a wine type flavor as well. Great.
T- holy wow...awesome sour, tart, killer cherries. Its only mildly puckering...but I don't care. It kicks ass. The oak flavor seeps through a little bit too. Perfection.
M- well carbonated, great body. Balance is fantastic with the tartness.
D- the sourness could be a little offputting to some...but not me. I love this. It packs a punch though, but you can't really taste the booze at all...dunno if I could handle more than one without my tastebuds being shot. Unreal beer 1,070 charactersbigfnjoe, Jul 25, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured a dark brown with ruby highlights that had a half finger head and very little lacing left on the glass. I love beers that have a nose like this one which consisted of oak funk, wine vinous characters, acidic sour notes, apples, and currants. You can definitely tell its gonna have some sour tartness. Sour vinegar currants strike first on the palate with oaky traits from the barrel, citric lemons, and cherry accents; nice sourness. The beer was medium body with a good amount of carbonation with a sweet sour and dry finish. It drank very well and is very tasty but for some reason everytime I drink a consecration I get a hangover. I guess I have overlooked the 10ABV and I always seem to drink a 750ml bottle to the neck.. 733 charactersGobzilla, Jul 24, 2010

The color is is strange. In ambient light it looks ruby red but when put to direct light it shows amber and almost traces of orange. The aroma is very vinous, sour but not too sour. Tons of grape. 
The flavor is damn near perfect. It's sour but the sour is just a part of the whole. It isn't dominant at all. It plays it's part. Lots of red wine flavor, the barrels impart the perfect amount of wood and wine flavors. I don't pick up a ton of fruit flavor but just an underlying sweetness. Unreal.
The mouthfeel and carb are spot on for the style and the drinkability was exceptionally high for the ABV and style. All in all, one of the best American Wild/Sours I've had. Incredible balance of flavors. Well done. 884 charactersBrew33, Jul 22, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750mL bottle - batch 3x4 - served into a tulip glass
Pours a translucent russet sort of brownish red. When held directly to light it looks like autumn leaves. Not much head from this beer, which surprises me a little. About half a finger's worth of khaki foam.
Lots of stuff going on in the nose. Balsamic vinegar, lactic sourness, aloe, tart cherries, lemon juice, musty leather, blackcurrant, a maltiness akin to a light brown ale, Christmas spice, white wine, cranberry. Lovely.
The tart cherries and blackcurrants are very forward on the palate. There are hints of lemon and persimmon too. There is a ashy/leafy astringency that doesn't register to me as coming from hops; I think it is the char quality from the oak barrels. Whatever it is it is helpful. This isn't really all that funky; the tartness and lactic sourness shine much brighter here. The finish is all tart cherry and lightly browned malt. Each sip reveals different fruits - orange, strawberry, black cherry, kiwi. Yes, plenty of kiwi as the beer warms. This is a beer that defies a concrete write-up. 
There is a certain thickness to the mouthfeel. It isn't big but the size of the body is conducive to the malt backbone that tries to shy away to the background. This is fairly uncarbonated, which is plenty fine. This feels "right" on the tongue. Flavor-wise this is supremely drinkable. The 10% ABV and prohibitive cost of over $20 a bottle limits the score on the drinkability. Then again, this beer hides its ABV so very well.
This is pretty delicious. Well worth trading for; better still if you can purchase it retail. Far from my very favorite sour beer but that doesn't matter because Consecration is plenty delicious. 1,702 charactersReaper16, Jul 22, 2010

Poured a plum mahogany color into a tulip, one finger khaki head that recedes quickly. Smell is currants and raisins up front with slight tobacco notes and some sour apple in there too really wonderful complex stuff. Taste is wonderful, sour, but not too sour it could be compared to sour plum juice with brett there really is too much complexity here to identify. Mouthfeel is light and slightly oily.

A: Pours a deep brown with a cream/tan head that shrinks to a ring and leaves little to no lacing.
S: Smells funky, tart, sour, bit of freezer burnt ice cream, nail polish, lemons, and cat pee. (Not all bad smells)
T: The taste is incredibly tart and sour, lots of grapefruit and lemons with some funk. The more it warms, some bubblegum comes through.
M: The feel is creamy yet astringent.
D: Decent drinkability.
This was a really great beer. As a wild ale, I expected funk, but I never expected the amount of lemony sourness. I was expecting a more beer type sourness, like more funk to it. At times it was almost like drinking lemon juice with beer, and it was great. This was a great continuation of sour beers for me. I can't wait to crack open my others. 803 charactersVoiceOfTheSoul, Jul 17, 2010

The head on this beer dissappates quickly, and leaves a few bubbles hanging desperately around the rim and in a Rorschacht pattern in the center that looks like a monkey-cow kind of thing. THe color is like copper and the heart of a big piece of amber.
The smell is amazing, oaky, slightly winey, with some beautiful funk, kind of like if Aretha Franklin sat in with George Clinton and the P-Funk Allstars and did something slow.
The taste is sour cherries wrapped in oak magic, with a tart tang like underripe strawberries in some fantasy world where they were actually something to look forward to. The carbonation is perfect and cleanses and elevates the chorus of flavors.
This beer drinks really well, wish I hadn't finished the last of the keg. To all the Boulderites before me, I salute you, to all those who didn't partake, you missed out. Can't wait to have this again, but I did see a bottle a few days ago... 1,006 charactersAnaz, Jul 15, 2010

Purchased at the brewery in Fall, 2009 and consumed while playing original Nintendo on July 12, 2010. Decadence.
A: A thin and flat appearance, ruby-tinged brown hued with very little head and virtually no retention or lacing. Upon the second pour, the head is very fizzy and fades almost instantly with a hissing sound. 
S: Cherries, oud bruin, wild yeast, wood. This beer smells very complex. 
T: A lot of flavors going on here. Everything I named in the aroma, plus a funky tartness that makes my lips pucker and my throat tingle. Really profound and complex, this beer is very intriguing and enjoyable. Many sours in the 10% or above abv range are considerably harsher than this.
M: Acetic, vinegar finish that grows stronger over time. Puckering finish that makes the cheeks (on your face) pucker and cringe (in a good way).
D: I'm taking on the whole 750mL tonight, but this is certainly a good candidate for splitting amongst a few friends. 965 charactersHuhzubendah, Jul 13, 2010

Big thanks to Stevefinny for this. 750ml Batch 002x01. Poured into a tulip.
A: Brownish maroon with a head that disappears like a scared turtle's. Nothing great, but the resurgence of effervescent bubbles is pretty cool. 4.0
S: Brett nosebomb with tart cherry and oak. Again, not overwhelming but still pleasant. 4.0
T: Tart fruitiness with a dry, oaky finish. Initial taste has a domineering sweet funk, but the oak comes on strong and dry at the end. Great balance between two opposing tastes. 4.5
M/D: Big carbonation and effervescence keep such a great clean taste. I love the thickness of a stout, but this is the complete opposite and so well done that I really appreciate it just as much. The 10% is essentially nonexistent. I couldn't drink this every day, but the complexity and style is something I would enjoy on a semi regular basis. 4.5/4.5 922 charactersTJBurgess, Jul 11, 2010

M- Drying, not too sweet, and impressively enjoyable at 10%.

Thanks to G311 (and the Mathmagicland BIF) for this beast!
My first RR wild, so let's do this. It pours a translucent dark garnet topped by a fizzy tan foam that's just too effervescent to exist for very long, kinda like those crazy man-made elements at the end of the periodic table. The laser etch at the base of my glass must be workin', 'cause a perpetually resurgent ring o' fizz is dancing around on the surface. Good times. The nose comprises a good amount of funk, oak, sour grapes, sourdough, prunes, and a touch of a bleu cheese/ranch blend. I can only assume this is one of those wild/sour beers. Am I right? Regardless, the fizzy ring continues to mock the lack of perpetual motion machines out there. The taste is a new kind of melange for me: sour berries, sour apples, rye bread, a slight bit of vinegar, extra sweet toffee in background spurts, some of that blue cheese again, and an underlying current of oak. I'm both pleased and intrigued, leading to a clear desire for more of this. The body appears to be a whispy medium, with a surprisingly slight carbonation and a very smooth, fluid feel. Overall, a very tasty and interesting brew. Simply put: get some! 1,213 charactersTMoney2591, Jul 08, 2010

A ruby amber color with bubble rushing to the top. One finger of white head that exhibits awesome retention. Not a lot of lacing left behind.
The smell is sour with vinous red grapes, vanilla, oak, tannins, and rose petals. 
The taste is sour with dark cherries, vinous red grapes, vanilla, oak, tannins, raspberries, and a hint of tobacco. Some leafy hops in the background.
Fairly light on the palette which is surprising. Slick and oily. A bit mouth puckeringly sour.
I probably wouldn't want to drink a lot of this, mostly because of the price, but it is delicious. 656 charactersbillshmeinke, Jul 05, 2010

Bomber poured into Bruery tulip. Batch 003x1.
A- Pours a deep burgundy that lets a small amount of light in around the edges. A finger's worth of head that dissipates fairly quick and leaves no lacing behind.
S- Some funk and a good amount of oak. A little bit of leather and some tart cherries. Just a hint of alcohol sneaks out. Some dark fruits can also be found in there as well.
T- A big red wine presence right away. Some mellow oak and some sweet cherries. A nice bit of sour but not overwhelming. Maybe a touch of cranberry.
M- Lighter bodied with a nice carbonation. Very dry on the finish and like noted above, sour but doesn't make the mouth pucker.
D- A very complex beer that hides the 10% very well. Overall, great balance. Probably my favorite offering from RR thus far. 826 charactersWisconsinality, Jul 01, 2010

After all, it's a 25.4 0z. dose, and, believe me, it's cheap for what it is. 1,028 charactersImpfan, Jun 28, 2010

smell: lovely - cranberry, tart cherry, oak, currants, vanilla, funky brett
taste: I was a big fan of this one on my SF trip this past winter and am glad to have another bottle downstairs after this one. Tart fruits dominate the palate - cranberry, black cherry. The cabernet barrels provide a really nice vinous body with highlights of sharp oak and vanilla throughout. Russian River is my favorite domestic brewery - that's for sure.

4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Cheers to psiweaver for sending this 375 ml bottle along from the west coast. Batch 004x2 indicates it was bottled on 2/3/2010, and it was poured into my Duvel tulip.
The beer pours a rusty brown, with red highlights when held up to the light. What little off white head does form immediately fizzles out. Given the style of beer and the ABV though, this isn't really a surprise and I'll just focus on the gorgeous color of the beer. The nose was easily appreciable even as I first poured the beer, and it's an awesome mix of horse blanket funk and sweet dark fruits, with just a hint of vinegar skulking around as well. The straight up sourness of the beer is much more prominent in the taste, and especially while the beer is still cold it overpowers the fruits and funk. The balance does improve some as the beer warms. While not overly thick, the beer absolutely coats my mouth, and there's a subtle carbonation highlights the sour flavors. While the beer is plenty tart, it shows up on the front of the palate, so by the end of each sip I'm ready to go for the next one. In addition, there's no heat at all from the beer, impressive at 10%. A great beer from Russian River (in other words, par for the course for them), and one I'll be looking to acquire more of in the future. 1,283 charactersaxeman9182, Jun 23, 2010

A: Deep ruby body with quickly dissipating head. Very active carbonation. No lacing whatsoever. 
S: Very woody, bretty aroma---the funk here is very nice! There's a pervading dark fruit aroma that must be from the currants---seems like raisins and cherries. There's a slight vinegar aroma lingering also. 
T: There's a lot going on here and it's changing with each sip. There's no doubt about the barrel-aging here---lots of oak. The brett (again) is very nice and raisins, dates, cherries, plums and even a touch of lemon. Through all this I'm even getting some of the yeast. No perceived alcohol whatsoever.
M: I would say that the mouthfeel is thin to medium. The beer actually coats the palate somewhat but I wouldn't say that it's 'thick' by any means. Just right for the style. 
D: Well, at 10% abv I'm not perceiving any alcohol and the 'sourness' is by no means 'over the top' so put me down for a few more. Very drinkable!
I haven't had alot of sours so I'm no expert but this was a very enjoyable glass of beer. The science behind these sour ales really amazes me. Thanks RR! 1,168 charactersAdamdc, Jun 23, 2010

Funky bretty smell, of dark fruits, from the currants i would assume, but they really do come through. woody and winey, bit of vinegar.
Starts off with a bit of sweetness and tart that mix around and then fade into a big sour dry aftertaste. leather and wood, grapefruit on the finish, green apples, dark fruit. 
great high carb mouthfeel, and i could drink this all the time until the 10% gets me, which is the only thing keeping it from being a higher score there. lovely beer. 630 charactersChadQuest, Jun 22, 2010

Batch 001x1, sampled June 19, 2010. 
The beer pours a clear dark red color with a white head. The aroma is awesome. I get lots of brown sugar, oak, vanilla and a low amount of tartness. The flavor is brown sugar, medium tartness, dark fruits, vanilla and oak. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. This beer matured into a wonderful drink. It was tried alongside Sanctification, Temptation, Supplication and Beatification and I think this beer was easily the star of the show. 531 charactersMora2000, Jun 21, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My first review of anything:
Deep, clear, red-brown. Small, but deliberately present head.
Woody, mellow, with a hint of sour berry.
Of course sour, a bit of chard. oak, lager like finish, but cabernet complex.
Light and void-filling, igniting all sides of the tongue, perhaps providing a sense of 'what's been missing' due to its completely rounded flavor.
Both refreshing and complicated at the same time, every sip is a new experience. Admittedly sour, not initially for everyone, but will grow quickly on some. Pair with goat cheese on sourdough with fresh red grapes on the side. Complex like a wine, but refreshing. 626 charactersbeardedpeter, Jun 20, 2010

Reddish brown with a medium-sized tanned/off-white head that leaves a lot of lacings. 
The aroma is malty with a noticeable funky and lactic character. Notes of wet wood, mud, grass and tart fruit. A herbal note as well, perhaps anise. 
The flavor is full with a nice malty foundation and tart fruit notes. Lovely tart currant flavors coupled with grass. Overall, the flavor development is really pleasant and integrated. The finish is very very dry considering the ABV, and has a light bitterness to it beneath a sour fruitiness. 
Full-bodied and smooth with a semi-sticky mouthfeel. 
This is a very impressive beer. Considerably sour and no sign of the alcohol, almost hard to believe it's 10%. Good craftsmanship. 735 charactersricke, Jun 19, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375ml bottle - Batch 004X5, poured into my Russian River tulip...
Pours a truly beautiful dark brown/mahogany with nice ruby highlights...three fingers of light tan head forms and quickly vanishes into a tiny bit of white film hanging around on the top of the beer...
Slight tart aroma, mostly cherries with a bunch of the oak from the barrels coming through, it almost overshadows most of the tart and fruity aromas...A lot of barnyard funk comes forward when I swirl the beer a bit...
Dark and tart to begin...spicy and sour dark fruits gives it a dark wine characteristic. Dry from the oak, earthy and leathery, pretty good but nothing spectacular...
Medium bodied but sticky, decent carbonation makes for a lively drink. Lingering wine like sourness and a bit of spice...
Pretty good sour, a little heavier and darker than I usually like my sours, definitely prefer a fresh Supplication to a fresh Consecration... 922 charactershawks10, Jun 18, 2010

A: Clear, reddish-amber color with a small amount of white head that quickly diminishes to a patchy residue and ring of foam.
S: Weak ascetic odor with slight urea. While it sounds repulsive, the overall mildness of the smell keeps it from being overpowering.
T: Taste begins very sour and also fruity. The taste of wine is diminished and blends well with the other flavors of currants and stone fruits. An aftertaste rapidly sets in consisting of strong, assertive oak and bready yeast. The flavor of the yeast is noticeable in every sip and I find myself looking forward to it--not what I expected to find in this beer. There is no flavor of alcohol detectable.
M: Viscosity is thin but not watery or distracting. Moderate carbonation could be less, as it seems to exhaust the palate by the end of the serving.
D: This beer is truly a challenge, both in terms of alcohol content as well as flavor. It is most similar to another Russian River sour, Supplication. Neither drinks as easily as some other American-brewed sour brown ales such as The Bruery's Oude Tart or Jolly Pumpkin's La Roja. Be warned before you open a large bottle of this beer for yourself--you would have to love sours unconditionally to enjoy all 750 ml. 1,315 charactersbeagle75, Jun 18, 2010

Thanks to Wisconsinality for bringing this one to the RR tasting!
A - Despite the tall pour, absolutely no head and no bubbles on top of the still slightly dirty brown amber color. Mahogany in the deep parts. The head could possibly be removed from the alcohol level.
S - Dark fruit holds up a lightly toasted amber malt aroma. The currants add a nice blend of fruitiness to the red wine hint that increases in strength as it warms up. The wine blends very well with the wild aroma of damp barrel and barnyard funk.
T - Very sour with a strong, almost overpowering tart funkiness. The cab barrel aging is almost overshadowed fully. Slightly fruitiness from the currants in the background blend well with the wine very nicely.
M - Medium-bodied with a strong sour-tart texture that's almost a bit too much. The lingering finish lasts forever and is fairly crisp with a harsh but complex kick.
D - This beer is fantastic but, damn, the sour finish and resulting sensation is harsh, even for a guy who loves sours. I'm thoroughly enjoying it but it is a a bit much to drink. Sharing the bottle is perfect. 1,200 charactersBeerFMAndy, Jun 17, 2010

Poured into my tulip the beer is a rusty brownish red with minimal head. Tiny flecks of soapy lace cling for dear life around the glass.
The aroma is mostly tart cherries. The wood is very pronounced with a good dose of booze that heats up my nostrils. Not much funk for a wild. The barrels must negate it.
The flavor is mostly tart cherry with a bit more funk than the nose. The alcohol is present in every sip but not so much that it offends. It has a very nice balance of sweet and sour. 
Medium body with light carbonation. A touch dry in the finish.
Overall a bit more of a boozy kick is felt with this one compared to the other RR wilds. Still super drinkable and tasty. 744 charactersbeerwolf77, Jun 17, 2010

A - It pours a cranberry-mahogany hue, slightly hazy, with a short-lived fizzy white head.
S - It smells certainly quite tart, with Band-Aid nuances and currant apparent and available. Similarities abound to dry reds like Chianti. Some alcohol on the nose. Reminiscent of Haandbakk, only less tart and insane.
T - Initially, it tastes quite sour, with much less fruit available in the gustatory than is present in the olfactory. As it develops, I start to appreciate it for being a very balanced sour, in terms of not too lactic, not too acetic, etc. Lingering Band-Aid towards the end, with a huge mouth-watering finish. Good stuff, not mind-blowing.
M - Dry and effervescent with a finish that bridges the gap between astringent and mouth-watering,
D - Very solid example of the style; not the best, but damn good. 939 charactersktrillionaire, Jun 15, 2010

(A)- Pours a deep and dark ruby red color. Produced an off-white head, but dissipated quickly down to nothing.
(S)- A light, but spicy red fruit aroma with a dry oakiness and a brief but present hay/straw/funk. Brief bits of vanilla and raisins here and there, but very subtle.
(T)- Pretty much just like the smell. Lively spicy red fruits with an oak dryness.
(M)- A big carbonation level with a good balance. Where is that big 10%ABV? Definitely integrated well. Spicy yet fruity at the same time.
(D)- Yet another great wild ale from Russian River! Stronger than the others, but still has that delicate yet pronounced funk and sourness. Great Stuff! The abv could really sneak up on you if you had a whole bottle of this to yourself. 859 characterssweemzander, Jun 14, 2010

A - The color of apple juice with a hint of pink. Not much in the way of head or lacing at all. I actually had someone ask me if I was drinking juice... in Toronado. Hmph.
S - Wow, much more tartness and sourness than I was expecting. This really slapped me in the face at first. Plenty of apple, berry, and malt vinegar. You can smell this beast from three feet away. The appearance really does NOT do it justice. 
T - At first, there's a ton of sour fruit -- currants, blackberries, and red grapes, followed by sour apples, maybe some candied sugar, and finally that lactic sourness, malt vinegar. Really a ton of depth here, I keep getting something different every time I take a sip. Outstanding flavor. 
M - Very nice, although maybe just a bit thin towards the finish. Fairly dry, which probably contributed to how fast I finished the glass. 
D - Well, the ABV is very well hidden, which didn't give me a problem. But the tartness might keep me from having more than one in a sitting, which is less a fault of this beer and maybe just my reaction to the style. 
O - Great; I could definitely see myself starting out with one of these every time I stop in there. 1,212 charactersdjmichaelk, Jun 10, 2010

S: Sour and wild, with vinegar and sour berries asserting dominance. Some vanilla and cranberries, with sourness far outweighing sweetness. Quite nice.
T: Starts out with intense sour cranberry, then some vanilla, then more intense berry tartness. Wave after wave of puckering goodness. Perfect balance of sourness and complex flavor. Fantastic.
M: Medium bodied, with carbonation that starts out a little sharp and becomes plush and forgiving.
D: I'm splitting this with a couple friends, and I'm glad that's the case. A whole bottle would be a real (delicious) chore.

4.2/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Enjoyed this from a skull-cracklingly thick clear glass goblet. A thin ring of rose-colored foam rode the meniscus momentarily. Juicy, lustrous, gem-like burgundy color.
The oak-aging is immediately apparent in the aroma, although I initially mistook it as bourbon barrel-aged due to a perceived faint smokiness. It's quite amazing how 'freshly-cut' the oak character comes across. Soft sour cherry is the next most discernible smell, followed by perhaps some vanilla custard.
Having been weaned mostly on (and recalling best) Monk's and Duchesse (and, yeah, through the years I've randomly had other various lambics/sours/wilds), the sour grip on the tongue with this was revelatory, though I'd like to believe not the most potent out there. In fact, it 'grips' tightest through the first few sips and, once accustomed to it, it's wonderful.
In addition to the somewhat sharp sourness in the flavor, there's a dry cherry, or maybe even raspberry, fruitiness - but not much. The oak comes out more mellow than in the aroma. And, why and from what, I don't know, I'm tasting bourbon - mostly up front - but it fades by the finish, which is vaguely reminiscent of champagne. Vaguely.
Definitely a complex, interesting beer. Wish it came out this way more often. 1,263 charactersBouleboubier, Jun 06, 2010

Batch 001x2. Had to do some research but apparently this is the first batch bottled on the 2nd day. Cheers to me!
Pour into a Duvel glass from a 750ml bottle.
A: The color of black or chai tea. Very very dark maroon color, clear though but very dark indeed. Soft pillowy white head on top. Not thick, not thin, just in the middle. No lacying to be found.
S: The smell reminds me of La Folie. Funky, tart, plumy, and juicy. Some light wood notes come through as it warms. Good cherry notes in there as well. Some almond in there too.
T: Cherries, currant, tart funk, and some sweetness. Some other stone fruit qualities. Earthy must and oak flavors on the end.
M: Thin and fizzy, still able to coat the tongue though. Good carbonation and a nice dry finish.
D: Drinks better as it warms. Not a sessionable drink but something to enjoy on a warm summer night. I really like this beer and would like to try other RR sours. So far the best American Wild I have had so far. 1,094 charactersrwf08, Jun 05, 2010

Smell is sour fruits--unripe cherries and currants mainly. The smell is also vinous, just like cabernet sauvignon. Taste is really tart, fruity. There are flavors of unripe cherries, red grapes, and even cranberries. There are also traces of yeast and oak. Mouthfeel is very acidic, carbonated and medium-bodied. 
This is a sour delight. Reminds me a lot of a geuze, but with hints of red wine. Rather complicated. This is probably not for everyone, but everyone should try it. 645 characterstheghost3, Jun 04, 2010

T- Loads of oak, sour fruit, funk, and some currants. Very sour and oaky. Lacking some complexity.
M- Tart and sour with a lasting woody presence. Very dry.
D- A little one dimensional and a wood presence that is a little too forward. Still, I enjoyed this beer and the alcohol content is pretty well hidden.
Overall, for $25 for 750 ml this is not worth the money, but it is not a bad beer at all. 596 charactersgordavidson, Jun 01, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Garnett/maroon with tons of active carbonation. Not the best head retention though.
The nose is a thing of beauty. Very fruity(cherry, currants, rasberry)oak, funk, tart, brett, barnyard.
THe flavor is just as if not more complex than the aroma. Vinous, tart(not overly so) fruit sweetness adds complexity, but tartness rules this castle. No alcohol detected!
This beer is well carbonated. It is very interesting in the way that the body drinks medium, but it definately has some weight and depth to it. Wow! this is one of the best MF in the biz!
Wow, if I was ever on the fence about sours, this beer has officaily converted me. Wallet: I am sorry, get ready for a beating. 679 charactersbonsreeb85, May 31, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4100th review
Appearance: Pours a deep red with a quick bubbly head and a silky texture leaving no lace and a slight bit of residue on the glass.
Smell: You can smell the tartness right away. Once cut there is a ton of fruit and funk underneath. There is some dark cherry mixed with red grape. The funk is prominent and wonderful.
Taste: One of the most balanced sours I've ever had. The tartness is underlaid with wonderful red grape and cherry. There are some nice curants and spices interweaving through the taste. There is also a nice complex funk from the yeast going through. Absolutely wonderful.
Mouthfeel: Creamy with a quick bite from the carbonation, overall fairly heavy for a beer this bubbly.
Drinkability: This beer is a rockstar in the sours category. I could have this everyday but I'd rather save it for a special occasion. 845 charactersBigIrishman, May 31, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On-tap @ Blue Palms Brewhouse in Hollywood - 5/20/2010. Served in a generic snifter. 
Clear burgandy body which glows a luminous cerise when held up to the sun. Large very active ivory head diminishes rapidly to a collar ringing a Ukiyo-e cloud.
Vinuous, cidery character suggests a Flanders Red initially - unusual aromatics...
Light rosé flavors intermingle with cherries, wild strawberries, a bit of simple syrup, and a bloom of citrus-laden tart hops which spread across the mid-palate. Vague wild "cat piss" notes emerge as well, but they actually work here. 
Not that I have a bottle open next to it, but any resemblance to the base beer (Salvation) seems to have vanished...
Medium-light bodied, a bit slick but still moderately carbonated.
I may need to re-visit this one in the bottle, as (with the exception of their IPAs) I usually prefer RR in that modality... 879 charactersaugustgarage, May 28, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5OOoooh yeah! I've been waiting to have some of this for a while now. I tried it a few times in the past and it's so delicious, but now I finally got to sit down, share the bottle with friends, and write a review. Batch #003, aged a bit, not sure exactly. Got this thanks to trades with Solomon420 and RaulMatisse.
A: Light fizzy head fades instantly over a semi clear rosy red mahogany colored beer.
N: Some nice sour fruits dominate. A little wild yeast is on the top with that, not funky barnyard wet horse Brett but more the sour fruit tangy delicious Brett, although there is just a touch of a barnyard aroma. A little oak at first, which seems to come out more as it warms. A little bit of a malty aroma, with slight sweetness. Just an overall great sour tangy fruit aroma.
T: WOw, so deliious. My mouth is watering from the first sip to half an hour after finishing it. Lots of sour fruits and deliciousness just pours out at first. A little tangy sour cherry fruit. The some malty flavors, a little sweet malt and toasty flavor. A slight wild yeast Bretty flavor, again more the sour fruit Brett than wild barnyard funk, but just a touch of the latter. The Brett overall is pretty mild. Some oak comes out as well, mostly in the background at first, but then starts to get a little more prevalent as it warms.
M: Trillions of bubbles, big carbonation, with a good body.
F: Dry finish, with some lingering mouthwatering goodness. It has a hint of sweetness but mostly dry, leaving the mouth ready for the next hit. Lots of lingering sour tangy fruit, a little sour cherry. A touch of wild Brett lingering on the finish, little funk even which seems to be a little more on the finish. Breaddy malts also come through. For being 10% there's no real booze, it drinks so well. This is a super delicious amazingly awesome sour. I wish so much we could get it around here, or even better if I could brew this myself. Sooo tasty. 1,933 charactersjlindros, May 26, 2010
3.15/5  rDev -28.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 2.5Pours a nice reddish brown that turns to a beautiful deep ruby when held in front of a light. Almost no head is present, but a bit of lacing is left behind. The carbonation is easily visible, and never dies down by the time the beer is finished.
Smells solid. Sour up front, with a hint of oak and some different fruits (can't pick out which fruits specifically from the nose.) 
Taste just isn't up to par with the smell or the expectations. I will say that this is only my second sour, with the supplication I had two days earlier my first. The supplication was absolutely incredible, and is probably my favorite beer now. This one, though, just doesn't do it for me. The sourness doesn't take up enough of the fruity characteristics and instead reminds me almost of pure vinegar. There is a slight fruity sweetness to it which saves it from being really bad, but the vinegar flavor is too prominent to make it anything more than average. I really wanted to like this one as much as supplication, but it just wasn't even close. Real disappointment.
Batch 003x1. 1,065 charactersHURTemHIZZY, May 25, 2010

3.85/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5After an unreasonably arduous brewday, I need something good to relax me and the funk was calling me. Poured into a tulip. Batch 003x4.
Cork pull gave a spirited pop, but then the beer inside got pissy and decided to spill out a bit over the top. Not really overcarbonated, but given the day I just had, I'm not surprised that this beer was out to get me. Anyway...
4.0 A: Dark mahogany color and hazy. Looks like I might have gotten the yeast in an uproar. Two fingers of fizzy off white head that acts and falls like the head on a can of Coke. 
4.0 S: Nose is pleasant, but pretty simplistic for a sour. On the acid front, the only thing that comes through with any power is acetic acid, which could be amplified by the currants. Latic acid is soft if it is even there at all. I can smell the barrel, but wouldn't have any idea that it was Savignon if I didn't read the label. Black currant and cherry fruitiness underlying.
4.0 T: Quite a lot more going on in the taste than in the nose. The first thing that struck me was a tongue paralyzing astringency, but this dies down upon additional sips. Very musky as well. The Cabernet makes an big appearance in the taste and actually this tastes more like a soured wine than a soured beer. Though there is a touch of vinegary-ness, there is a lot more lactic acid, though surprisingly not too tart. Tannins with currant and raisin fruitiness. Though I appreciate complexity, the big bold flavors are each too aggressive on their own and fail to mesh harmoniously.
3.5 M: Lighter medium. Good moderate amount of fizzy carbonation. Astrigency on finish that lingers. Alcohol is noticeable, but seems more like 7% than 10%.
3.5 D: Not bad, but seems like there are too many flavors competing without any direction. 1,766 charactersDavoleBomb, May 24, 2010

A: A reddish brown that is dark but surprisingly clear. A quarter inch or less of an off white head
S: Smells kind of like someones apple cider went bad. Sour apples with a bunch of funk. 
T: Tastes like sour apples with a bunch of sour, funk and sour funk. A sharp sour finish to it. 
M: Smooth, but well carbonated. Acidic.

Reddish, clear medium brown body. Small head with no lace. Sour aroma of fruity esters, cherries, funky Brett, and balsamic vinegar; no hop aroma.
Sour berry flavors are vibrant and balance is definitely present. No woodiness present and the finish is currant sweetness.
A taste and drinkability promoting carbonation level; not too high to slow you down, and not to low to damage mouthfeel and taste. Light bodied and tongue coating.
Supremely well balanced between sweet and sour, and dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is expertly hidden and the flavors work very well together. Just enough fruit flavor and sweetness without overtaking the sour aspects. Flawless... 707 charactersTheJollyHop, May 21, 2010

M: rich and smooth in the mouth with some bite and sourness.

A-Pours a ruby/brown with a 1/4" off white head that faded quickly and left no lacing.
S-Tart dark fruit, a slight red wine smell, a bit earthy.
T-Sour plums, cherries, granny smith apples, a bit spicy. Very tart all the way through.
M-A crisp carb bite, yet still smooth, on the lighter side of medium body.
D-Its a sipper to be sure, but it goes down easily enough.

4.76/5  rDev +7.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I usually never drink a beer with fruit added to the mix (in this case currents), but I love Russian River and constantly tell myself I'm blessed to live close by. So... I bought a 750mL of Consecration - it's not cheap $22 a bottle.
Now for the review....
A: Nice copper/ruby
S: Smells like red wine at first, then you can smell some currants and "regular" beer smells
T: Tart like a sour beer should be. The first thing you test is the sour, then you you can taste the currents, the Cabernet oak barrel, and traditional beer flavors. It leaves I nice finish of sour cherries.
M: Wonderful effervescent feeling on the tongue!
D: I never heard of sour beers until I first started to go regularly to the the Toronado. At first, I didn't like them, but they grow on you quickly.
Consecration is an excellent "sour beer" (aka Brettanomyces). I got my money's worth with this one. The alcohol does not over power it at all, in fact it's subtle. 
Consecration is a perfect example of the "new era" of experimental micro-brews. 
Beers like this really make you wonder why you ever drank PBR, Bud, or Corona. Consecration is one beer raising and bettering beer's reputation (ruined by the macro brews). 1,204 charactersBluetick, May 17, 2010

Light ruby colored body with a small light beige head. Aroma is of very tart and funky dark fruits. Can't pick out any specific fruit in particular. Taste is mouth puckering funky tartness to the extreme. Very fruity. The barrel aging adds depth and complexity.

A: Ruby deep brown, it poured with a thinner head that died to a good cream collar.
S: Raisins and prunes, sour red wine with a nice oaky characteristic, leafy hops, and cabernet.
T: Sour, with cabernet and oak, cranberry and cherry (mostly from the currants), with a moldy, leafy hops on the finish.
M: Thinner and spritzy.

Pours a dark burgundy, with a slight pink head a little less then an inch thick. it goes away pretty quick.
the currents really come out in the beer! Gives it an earthy dry smell, lots of fruit sweetness is upfront with a bit a tartness on the nose.
The taste and mouth feel is just amazing. very smooth mouth feel with a slight tingle of carb on the tongue. Up front is a strong tart hello, then followed by a very sweet taste of blackberries followed by currents.

Smell is funky, some vinegar and barrel notes come through here.
Taste is of big funkiness, some oak comes through as well as vinegar and other sour notes. Some subtle horseblanket and prevalent leather come through. Very tart in the finish, quite a good sour. Another great one from Russian River.
Mouthfeel is of medium carbonation with a light dry finish. My moth waters after the finish for quite a while. 
Quite drinkable for a sour of 10% ABV, I like this beer quite a bit and will seek it out in the future. 686 characterspmccallum86, May 14, 2010

On tasting, bubbles attack every exposed part of my mouth, giving birth to a flavor explosion. Is it wine? ale? sour? wood? Delcicious. Best of all, for having a such great, complex taste, it doesn't kill your palate. This my favorite of the Russian River 'tion beers. It's a good beer to give a swill drinker a taste of, exposing them to what's possible with a little creativity and experimentation. 517 charactersandyfrancis, May 12, 2010

Smell&gt;Sour cherry. Yeasty. Wow. Not my cuppa, but pretty fab for those who like this sort of thing.

A- this one pours out a dark cola colored body with a beige colored head that starts off tall and then quickly fizzes away. little spots of lacing are left behind. 
S- very vinous and different. a little bit of red wine vinegar, raisins, and red grapes. definite odor of wild yeast/bacteria. some scents from the barrel. not as sour smelling as i was expecting. 
T- the taste is equally complex and different as the smell. red wine vinegar comes through loud and clear. the sourness i was expecting comes through more subdued as the smell would indicate. leather, soft cheese, and lots of cherries, red grapes, green apples, and raisins. not a trace of the alcohol.
M- medium to full bodied and highly carbonated. about what i was expecting from a big wild belgian dark ale. leaves the mouth feeling very dry.
D- this was very easy to finish. that was pretty unexpected for something this big. not the most sour or funky beer ive tried, but one ill try to get again so i can see how it develops. 1,129 charactersjwinship83, May 10, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at Daily Pint. Most likely the fourth batch. I can't believe it has taken me this long to review what is currently my favorite beer, but, better late than never. 
A decent amount of carbonation sitting atop a deep ruby body, almost brownish in tinge. Very sexy legs as I tilt the glass. 
Some sour tannic goodness as far as the aromas are concerned, with a nice light whiff yielding a perfume-y sensuousness to the bouquet. I smell something else in there, a richness I can't quite identify. 
Ah, so tart and spicy and lactic-acidy and cabernet-sauvignon-y. Not as smooth as some of the older batches, but this remains so enough to warrant plenty of accolades. The peppery flavors from the currants really stands out, as does the rich sourness. 
Mouthfeel is fairly thick, but with the strength of the tartness I can't hold it enough for a thorough swishing (yeah, call me a wuss, go ahead). 
Overall, this fourth batch could use some age, BUT, GDit Consecration is Consecration. And it feels like Consecration: raising me up to the heavens on a 10% ABV. God's work continues to be done. 1,099 charactersjminsc76, May 09, 2010

Batch 001x2
APPEARANCE: Pours into my Weyerbacher tulip a ruddy brown with a vibrant off-white head on top. It tries it's hardest to keep up with itself and refresh the waning foam, but it ultimately settles to a small but full sizzling cap.
SMELL: Very tart and vinous with a vinegar-like sour. In the background, things like chocolate and fruits come out, but this beer is all sour!
TASTE: Ok, we'll get this out of the way. Really, really sour. Otherwise, the wood and wine come on strong before giving way to chocolate and cherry on the finish. Oh yeah, and it finishes tart.
MOUTHFEEL: Quite thin and highly carbonated. This seems right on for style.
DRINKABILITY: I know I could drink this forever, but some consideration should be given to how the robustness of this beer affects how much you can have. Even still, I'll be polishing off this bottle easy.
Ah, I love my birthday. Great weather and great beer. Can't wait for next year. 1,079 charactersjmalex, May 06, 2010

Anyways, I split the bottle with a couple friends and was worried the sour and funky flavors, but they actually mild compared to some of the guezes I've tried. Instead of being a big, beat you over the head sour beer, the tang compliments the fruit, estery yeast, and mellow dark malts. I should also say that for 10%, this is as drinkable as any good beer is going to be. 457 characterstempest, May 01, 2010

Poured from 750ml bottle into a Bruery tulip 
A - The beer pour a dark red. Looks similar to a red wine. Has very minimal white head that faded away rather quickly. Virtually no lacing while drinking. 
S - The smell is very interesting with lots of unique flavor profiles. I can smell the wine barrels that it was aged in. It has hints of oak and a stronger alcohol as well such and bourbon maybe. It has a very tart smell to it as well with dark sweet fruits in the mix. 
T - I had one half glass with dinner and enjoyed it but it didn't seem that sour/tart to me from what I had read about this beer, but when I poured myself a full glass later in the evening the second glass seemed much more tart/sour. I can definitely taste the red wine from the barrel aging along with some oak. Has sweet fruit tastes to it as well. I can't distinguish the individual fruits though. I can also taste the current in the beer. The beer is very tart and dry on the back half. It is quite tasty but is definitely a sipping beer. 
M - Mouthfeel is medium to high amounts of carbonation with a lighter body to the beer. Good for the style but you can't take very large sips of it. 
D - This beer hides its ABV well, but is not something that I can drink a lot of in a sitting. Because it is so tart it much be sipped and savored so I don't think I would have more than a glass or two at a time. Its refreshing for the first glass but after that the ABV starts to hit you. Good beer overall and for the style. 1,516 charactersKrevee, Apr 30, 2010

THe pour produces a nice burnt amber color with a very thin but lively head on it that falls fast to a thin ring around the glass but is kept interesting with a lot of bubbles coming from the lazer etching on the bottom of my perfect pint glass.
S= The smell is sour. A slight vinegar odor coming from it. Nice sour cherry or current odor to it. Refreshing.
T= Just as delicious as I expected. There is a nice mouth puckering sour taste to it. The vinegar that was in the smell doesn't come through in the taste at all. The taste is sour without being overly offensive. Exellent current taste to it as well as some really refined oak barrel taste. Really complex. Most sours I find to be somewhat one demensional but all of Russian Rivers I've found to be divine. The alcohol is really really well hidden. This is a creeper.
M= Nice and dry. Puckering and refreshing. 
D= Another home run from Russian River in the sours I've had from then. While excellent this is not as good as Supplication. I like RR sours more than Cantillon. While they are both excellent I think the RR sours add another layer of complexity you don't find in Cantillon. California has no idea how spoiled they are. This beer is world class. 1,280 charactersjjanega08, Apr 30, 2010

A- Pours dark ruby, almost brown in color. Very little head that quickly disappears. Minimal lacing left.
S- Sour, sour, and sour! I'm thinking I'm gonna love it. There are grapes, dark fruits, and vinegar present. 
T- I def get the red wine notes! Very mouth puckering, this thing is sour! Dark fruits including red grapes, plums, and a faint raisan. The vinegar I get in the nose is also present, however, it's not overwhelming. A nice oak rounds it out.
M- Like I already mentioned, this just strips your tastebuds. Good carbonation level and a pretty dry finish.
D- I could easily have drank the whole bottle. I'm looking forward to trying the batch #2! I liked this more than the supplication, which we drank right b4 this. 817 charactersurwithdave, Apr 26, 2010

Had a sample of this at Night of the Barrels and really liked it, so thanks to msulinski for sending me a bottle.
Pours a dark, red grape-skin color with an off-white head that slowly falls apart into a thin ring around the edges of the glass. Light lacing.
Grapes, vinegar and dark fruits make up the majority of the nose. Somewhat acidic with a light alcohol aroma. Little bit of funk.
The flavor consists of sharp, slightly acidic, tart red grapes, chewy currants, bits of raisin and vanilla. Some warming alcohol and woodiness from the barrels comes through a bit. Nice tartness mixed with a small amount of cherry and plum.
Mouthfeel is carbonated well, maybe a little more than I would like and leads to a little bit of foaminess. Warming alcohol and a bit of mouth puckering tartness.
Drinkability is pretty good. This is a big beer at 10% and with 1 year of cellaring it has some sharpness to it. Definitely a sipper, but decently complex and enjoyable to drink.
Overall, this is another winner from Russian River, but maybe not quite on par with Supplication. I remember the sample I had on tap being smoother and a bit fruitier, but that could be due to the fact that this bottle has been aging for about a year. All in all though, this is a tasty beer and one that I hope to have again in the future. Looking forward to trying more Russian River sours. 1,382 characterssisuspeed, Apr 25, 2010

A: A murky sienna color. The pour dropped a nickel of foamy white head that faded rather quickly and didn't leave much lace.
A: Sour dark fruits, and notes of wood. Red grapes, apples, red wine, and oak. I get a bunch of sour notes, that warn me of what's to come.
T: Yup, this one's sour. Probably the sourest of wilds I have yet to try. More wine and woody oak. Sour dark fruits, cherry, blackberries, apples, and barnyard funk. Finishes rather dry and tart.
M: Medium body, high levels of carbonation. This one has a bit of a bite to it.
D and overall impression: Drinkability is somewhat lower. This one is extremely sour. Overall, I had this one back to back with Supplication, and let me tell you, it dosen't hold a candle. It is a little too sour for my taste, and the oak and wine barrels, while good, didn't do it for me in this brew. I liked it, just didn't love it. Skal. 979 charactersGtreid, Apr 25, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a clear dark amber color with some redness and brown hues about it. Served with no head present and minimal amount of faint spotty lacing. Nose is funky with oak and woodsy characteristics. Alcohol and Brett are apparent. Dry fruit smells riddled with alcohol. Taste is puckering with sourness and alcohol right upfront playing a lead role. Quite drying and tart. Flavors of dark skinned fruit come through as it warms...and warms it does as the alcohol in this beer is there in both warmth and taste. The woodsy flavors mesh favorably with the alcohol. Lingering tartness is left in the mouth that is puckering enough to make you go back in for continuous repetitive sips. Light feel and highly carbed this was one very enjoyable experience. 749 charactersstakem, Apr 20, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Wonderful beer that comes out in a dark purple haze color. The head fades away fast, but leaves a light ring around the edge of the glass. Not a strong nose, but certainly got a little sour fruit (cherries and grapes). The bright taste with the sour finish was wonderful. It was not overpowering, but just perfect in finish. And the flavor kept on for a long time after, causing me to buy another 2. One for aging. 
Served in a snifter. 437 charactersJessee, Apr 18, 2010

I smell dark cherry and fig and some toasty woodiness... Smells a little funky sourness.
Tastes very nice with notes that follow nose... Very nice. Pleasant sourness on the finish. 
Nice mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation-- this thing is little heftier than the supplication, not quite as drinkable, but
still scores highly. 516 charactersAleWatcher, Apr 16, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served on tap at the brewery, as well as in subsequent bottles. Absolutely lives up to the ratings. Pour is a dark amber with a rapidly thinning head, smell is complex and wonderful. Taste is phenomenal: not much of the currents that it is brewed with, but instead cherries and grapes, as well as a pleasant complex sour mouthful. Much more sour taste than funk. Completely drinkable, which you have to watch because at 10% alcohol this will knock you down quick. Can't taste the alcohol at all.
My favorite out of all the Russian River sours I've tried so far. 562 characterspunkindrublic50, Apr 14, 2010

A - Poured into my NB tulip glass. Dark amber/brown in color. The head fades quickly with a pool of carbonation forming in the center, bubbling for the duration of the drink
S - Sharp oak smell with hints of the currants present
T - A very sharp, sour initial taste. Currants, grapes, and oak taste on the back end once the sour fades.
M - Completely amazing. Resonates throughout the mouth, touching every spot long after swallowing. Your taste buds literally pulsate for a few seconds after a good swirl.
D - Better with every sip. For a sour it goes down well and does not fade, opening up as it gets warmer. 628 charactersebin6, Apr 05, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Excited to finally try this one... I've had this aging for about a year.
This is a corked 750 mL bottle poured into a large snifter. A dark translucent ruby red color, initially very fizzy and well carbonated with around an inch of head. The head dissipates fairly quickly.
Smell is a sour and tart mix of cranberries, cherries, roses, and lemon.
A really powerful taste in this one. Cranberries and lemon are the dominant flavors to me, but also has some smoky flavors, rose petals, currants, wine, and vinegar-like acids. Alcohol blends in so well here it is very easy to drink.
Mouthfeel is very fizzy and well carbonated. Awesome drinkability.
This had a lot of hype around it and lived up to my expectations. Delicious and interesting. 745 characterswebmanspidey, Apr 05, 2010

Smells of dark red fruits, and sour at that. Cherries and I think currant, maybe grapes. 
Sour, as I guess it's supposed to be. Sour cherries and apples battle back and forth on my tongue. There's a touch of cedar in the aftertaste. I'm thinking that it's supposed to be oak, but it's more like cedar to me. 
Mouthfeel is, um, sour. Pucker up. The texture and carbonation are thin, like champagne. 
I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and even my wife appreciated it, but it was a little too sour for my liking. I definitely recommend it and would have it again, though. It's just one that I'd only have a single glass of at the end of the night. 738 charactersVonerichs, Mar 31, 2010

Batch 003x1
Poured into a snifter. WHOA! The carbonation in this beer is the most I've ever seen. The pour didn't leave much head, but the bubbles rapidly rose from the bottom to the top for the duration of it's time spent in my glass.
Oak, dark wine, and grape is all I'm getting from the aroma.
Taste was pretty sour. Definitely pick up the Cabernet and oak. With that I pick up some dark berries. I also got some malt action which complimented the those dark fruits very nicely.
The mouthfeel was fairly dry and tingly from the carbonation.
Overall this was a pretty solid beer. I found it to be similar to others in the Russian River line (Supplication & Damnation) in that it reminded me of a beer/champagne and wine all wrapped up into one. Very complex. I hope to visit this again when my palate has become more developed. 849 characterspwoody11, Mar 29, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was the first sour I have tasted and I was surprised with the taste. I bought this beer with huge expectations and I was not disappointed. When I poured into my glass it was a dark brown color with a very thin head, which I was not expecting. Since it is a sour I was expecting a lighter color, because I was picturing a lemon shot or something. 
When I smelled this beer it smelled like a floral bouquet. I kept telling my wife to smell it because it smelled so good.
Then when I drank it felt like I was drinking wine and not beer. So I tried it again and I was shocked that this is called a beer.
Overall this is a good beer that s very drinkable even though it is at 10% ABV. If you have friends that are wine drinkers you need to have them try this, they will love it. 781 charactersTKEAnimal, Mar 29, 2010

Poured into a chalice, beautiful dark amber brown with great cream colored head, great retention and lacing. Medium carbonation. Smell was earthy and sweet, then bitter. Taste started out momentarilly fruity and sweet then going to incredibly dry and bitter from the currants and barrel aging. Very complex, hard to drink in quantity but paired well with a steak and was able to finish it quite easily and was left wanting more by the end. Very good. 485 charactersstingrayvr6, Mar 29, 2010

On tap at the brewpub on 6/30/09. Poured a beautiful dark burgundy with a cream head. Mild aroma with hints of berries. There is a mild sweet flavor, but ultimately the brett and sour currants take over. This has great flavor, with touches of sweetness, then a very well balanced bitter finish. The hype is worth it. 391 charactersChrisPro, Mar 29, 2010

Pours a dark, deep red...crimson like, with a decent size off-white head that dissapates quickly. Appears to be a lot of carbonation still in this one, appearance is hazy...but can see fizzy bubbles constantly surfacing.
Great funky aroma! Definitely smells sour/Brett characteristics. There's also a solid sweet currant, and oaky aroma. Booze is a non-aroma-factor.
Wow! GREAT flavor. This is an incredible sour(American Wild Ale). While there's a definite sourness from the Brett/and resembling the sourness of cherries...or currants...there's a HUGE complimenting sweetness coming through from the fruit. A great combination for sure! Bottle say aged in Carbernet barrels; this is evident in the dry finish...but not too dry as to hurt the experience.
This is a solid beer! High carbonation, medium mouthfeel, funky and sweet flavor, LONG lasting sweet aftertaste...with a competing sourness! Drinkability is excelent. I finished the entire bottle in about an hour, and of course, as it warms to room temp, it's still AS enjoyable as the first pour/sip. GREAT beer! 1,174 charactersShadesOfGray, Mar 27, 2010

Consecration- Barrel aged sour ale with currants added & 10%. One of my all time favorite sours. It poured ruby red. It smelled of sour cherries, oak and funk. It tasted like dried currants, sour pucker, oak, wood and cabernet. Very wine like and tasty.

4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This was my very first "sour ale":
Menu says American wild ale with currants and aged in oak barrels.
A- dark red-brown. no head. decent carbonation.
S- cherries. sourness. clear hints of pinot nior wine. oak aromas.
T- Really dry. Almost tastes like a glass of wine. Can definitely taste the wine notes from the barrel. cherries/grapes/currants. Very tart and sour. No traditional beer flavors present.
M- nice texture. definitely bites back with dryness. nice carbonation. tart, but refreshing. also has a bit of alcohol bite.
D- Tasty and refreshing, but ABV makes it a bit difficult to have more than one...
Awesome, but definitely an acquired taste. My wife liked it, but one of the other wives hated it. Hop heads might not like it. 745 charactersgpioski, Mar 23, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap, served in a flute
Arrived at my table with an almost completely faded yellow head that fell to just a thin layer of foam and left some stray lines here and there. The body sat a translucent, dark mahogany and had streams of bubbles moving swiftly to the top of the glass.
The aroma is lacking a little punch. Oak and caramel with balsamic notes dominating. Some dark fruit skins are apparent, but lay low, along with some old leather.
The fruit comes out to play much more so on the flavor, balancing out the acidic, tart, balsamic flavor. Dark cherries, red and green grape skins along with oak woodiness and a finish of dry tobacco. The flavor profile reminds me a lot of red wine. Deep, vinous fruits, tart and a dry, tobacco/leather finish.
The alcohol is well buried here. Light to medium body with prickly carbonation and a light, crisp, dry finish. I liked how the finish was more fruit and leather than balsamic.
For the style, I found this to be amazingly drinkable. The tartness never overwhelmed, and the dark vinous qualities were able to shine through, bringing a welcome balance. 1,106 charactersColForbinBC, Mar 22, 2010
4.34/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Batch 001X2 750ml bottle into a big tulip twice watching the Breaking Bad premiere. Bottle date is 12/26/08 so this is at about 15 months in the bottle. Review #600. I reviewed this off tap but wanted to get a bottle version in.
Dark dried blood brown out of the bottle, once layered in the glass, Consecration casts a deep dark mahagony brown and appears ruby red mixed with iced tea brown. Champagne like medium tan loose bubbled foam rose up buzzing with vigor yet it dwindles quickly with the same amount of vigor. No lacing from this, which I always get off the tap.
The smell on this is heaven, 15 months worked out the kinks and this is exibiting true integration with the fruit, yeast, malt and wild bug additions. The currants while faded are still a pleasure to sniff while it's backed by some Belgian abbey yeast. Chocolate from the malts which are just coming out and a certain kind of funkiness on the light side. 
Bang, zoom, to the moon, this is where it's at. Up front sqeezed currant juice mixed in with some sweet malt and accidity on the tounge. Tastes of chocolate, figs, tobacco and some wild yeaat playing nice with with the Sauvignon taste, which is marvelous and my second favorite wine barrel beer behind Temptation. The wine influence just builds with time and with the 15 months on this bottle, the wine has taken front stage with the currants fading. A funky Wine beer with fruit influence in the back, I like it.
Pretty tame on the mouth when cold out of the bottle or tap for that matter but overall this is acidic, funky, mildly tart and fruity. A nice step above medium with perfect carb thats crisp at times, non existant at times, and a beast at times with sharp pricks to the tounge depending on temp and what portion of the bottle your drinking. At times my mouth got hot for a few seconds but that's it. Towards the end of the bottle the dregs kind of muted the acidic nature of Conse. A lot of variations on feel of this beer and I think Batch one is perfect, or near perfect.
Try to drink a aged bottle of this to yourself sometime, it's a treat and goes through many changes over three hours. The wine is huge, the funk is light, the fruit is fading but still large. This got me a pretty tipsy. I'm feeling this 10 percent, this is drinkable, but it will do damage, I can't wait for the smaller bottles. I plan to drink the rest of my batch 1 bottles in another 15 to see where this goes. 2,433 charactersBARFLYB, Mar 22, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The third RR beer I tried at TJs in PA yesterday. Could this day get any better? Another awesome wild ale. Served in the same glass as Supplication, oversized flute like shape. Comes out with a dark red-brown color which light can get through, not much. The head and cloud are missing but I have never really seen a wild ale with one. The ring around the edge leaves sticky suds behind but no real lacing. The smell is a very nice blend of oak wood and sour lambic. Some dark toasty/caramel malt shines through leaving me with a very interesting beer ahead of me. The taste comes down to sour fruit, oak and brown ale malt hints to me, in a very nice way. The sour and barrel wood notes compliment each other very well and the brown ale malts help back up the sour nicely. Not very complex to me but very cool and creative. Mouthfeel is nice. Moderate body with moderate carbonation and good cream. Not as solid as Supplication but still very nice. A coat of sour oak and malt is left on the tongue. This one gets very sour to me after a while, one glass is the perfect quantity for this great beer. The price was awesome and so wasn't the flavor. RR is great to me so far. 1,173 characterscbutova, Mar 22, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked up a bottle of this on a recent trip out to the RR brewpub in Santa Rosa. $22/bottle, but after trying a few glasses of the stuff at the pub I knew it was well worth the price.
I poured it into my Russian River goblet and was greeted by the tangy smell of Brett and the other wild yeast that Russian river uses to make their sours pack the punch they do. The color is deep, deep red, almost purple. Aromas of sour fruit, currents mainly, waft from the glass. The taste is just as lively and tangy as the smell, perhaps even more so. There's also a good deal of wine flavors here, in addition to the yeast and fruit elements. Surprisingly drinkable for a ten percent beer. This was the beer that made me fall in love with sours, and every time I drink it the moth puckering sensation reminds me of why I will never look at beer the same way again. This is an absolute must for sour fans, and highly, highly recommended for adventurous souls looking to break away from the usual. 984 charactersIrieJackalope, Mar 21, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance: A loud pop as it's uncorked. Pours into a Brooklyn tulip as if it's quite alive, with about two fingers of very volatile and quickly dissipating head. Heavy soda-like carbonation is evident from the bubbles, and is, I'm certain, the only reason there's any bubbles around the edge of the glass, and in fact, across the top of the glass. I'm curious to see how this one will hold up after sitting out for a bit--right now it seems to be something to be contended with. The color itself is almost mahogany, but it's slightly closer to brown tones than red ones. The brew is dark, but clear--just hard to see through because of the depth of tone. How fascinating.
Smell: As I've been writing the appearance notes, the smell has diffused into the rest of the room and I can smell it from several feet away. Smells amazing--sweet and sour all at once, and particularly reminiscent of sour power on sour skittles (down to the little bit of sugar that is throw into that mix). White vinegar notes are also heavily present, and quite mouth-watering, as well as sweet and sour cherries, slight red wine, and balsamic vinaigrette. Below the surface are slight leather and tobacco notes, as well as a bit of oak. Slight chives in the smell.
Taste: Excellent sour taste that manages to blend in wonderful vinegar notes without being overwhelming and tasting like straight white vinegar (though I don't necessarily mind those, either...). A lot of dark and earthy notes--bitter tobacco, leather, earth, and oak--are nicely blended in, and I'm getting a lot more fruit out of it than i did in the nose--sweet and sour cherries, grapes, raisins, bitter cranberries. A LOT of red wine notes in this one--which I suppose makes sense given the barrels. Slight bitter aftertaste that makes the darker notes and red wine stand out as more prominent. I don't want to understate the sour notes, as they're definitely there, but this is so extremely well-crafted that the complexity and depth of the other notes is almost surprising. Gets sweeter as it warms. Wonderful.
Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is very nice. The intense, soda-like bubbles mentioned in the appearance are not nearly as daunting as they appeared. It's nearly perfectly--if not undercarbonated. Slight very pleasant aftertaste as described above. Light to medium bodied and goes down smoothly and quickly.
Drinkability: Drinkability is extremely excellent given the 10% ABV. Extremely well crafted and delicious, and the alcohol is not at all apparent. 2,507 charactersafausser, Mar 20, 2010

S - The aroma has all the complexity of a Belgian sour along with a decent malt nose. The cab sav and currants blend perfectly to add to the complexity.
T - Great interplay of sour and malt characteristics. Tart as a Rodenbach Grand Cru, but leaves you with a sweet aftertaste with still being dry somehow. Tartness and bubbly carbonation reminiscent of champagne. Subtle oak rounds out the flavor.

Forceful pop from the cork, made it a few yards into the other room even :D Gunsmoke emitted from the bottle, thankfully not a gusher. The tawny brown beer produced an uprising of tan foam, that was fizzy and fairly short lived. It faded to an ever present ring that clung to the edge. 
Damp leather, tobacco, slight brown sugar and balsamic sweetness in the nose. Reminiscent of best-in-class Oud Bruins like Oerbier Reserva and Haandbaak. Fairly restrained wildness, pretty accessible to the wild/sour ale novice. 
Sustained tartness at first, moving into sour territory before dissipating quickly. Lingering aftertaste of leather and tannic dark fruit skins, currant and black cherry. Dry mild oak and wine grapes imparted from the Cab barrels. Pretty clean and full of sour fruitiness. Well carbonated, lending to an effervescent feel. 
Paired with cheese, the acidity is more obvious, and scrubs the palate clean. 959 charactersemerge077, Mar 13, 2010

4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Reviewed from my notes. Served in a snifter as final beer at the Lion's Pride's Belgian Beer Dinner (past of their first Belgian beer Fest). It is a clear beer with a dark plum color. There isn't much head, just a thin off-white ring of foam where the beer touches the glass. The nose is just amazing, with notes of port, sherry and a bit of wild, sour yeast. I can taste sour grapes, both white and red; each has a distinct flavor profile. There is a warm alcohol ester aftertaste. It tastes incredible. There is a medium body with a ton of carbonation. The alcohol vapors feel great. The carbonation and sour flavors leave a little tingle on my tongue after I swallow. As a single glass pour, the beer is very drinkable. If I ever found myself in possession of a full bottle, I'd want to split it with a friend. 813 charactersToasterChef, Mar 08, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml bottle. Batch 001x2. Served in Russian River tulip.
A - Pours mostly dark brown with a fair amount of garnet that shows around the edges. The tan head come to about an inch before quickly receding. It ends up a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Lacing is moderate. Overall this is a good looking brew that makes me long for a 4.25 rating option. 
S - Sweet with cherry up front. Could be some white grape mixed in as well. Notes of fig and alcohol also prominent. Alcohol is not overwhelming though. Shows signs of bread and granola midway to end. Light oak comes through at the very end. Another wish for the old 4.25 button here.
T - Very tart out of the gate. Green apple, grape and sour cherry all come through in one way or another. Alcohol is definitely in the flavor but seems muted against pretty big tart and sour front end. It has a nice musty wet hay / farmhouse middle going for it. Mild wood flavors seem to come and go throughout. Some of the malty flavors finish it up. Caramel and fig mostly. Very nice, overall.
M - Medium bodied with a very active carbonation level. The tickling on the palate works well for this beer. It almost has a champagne feel to it. Finish is bone-dry and tart at first. Then a touch of sweetness comes into the mix as well.
D - Drinkability is very good. Very, very nice balance of flavors in this brew. 750ml? No problem. One would never guess this one at 10% until it was probably too late. Didn't really know what to expect opening this one up and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. The initial tartness is a blast at first but quickly drops to a moderate level that just...works. Very happy I got the chance to try this one out. 1,696 characterscsmiley, Mar 08, 2010

Smell of sour cherry, brettynomyces, oak, grapes , currants, and raisin. 
Taste of currants mixed with grape juice, a non educated beer drinker could think it passes as a wine. Extremely tart and sour flavors from wine barrel aging with 4 different strains of wild yeast, this beer is very complex and tasty. Where some wild beers taste slightly offensive, this one tastes delicious and has balanced flavors where one particular side doesn't overshadow the other flavors, oak perhaps being the strongest. Wine barrel aging, lacto, and fruit additions all complement the flavors in this delicious treat. 759 charactersalpinebryant, Mar 06, 2010

Look: Deep crimson, slight haze, thin head with little lacing
Smell: Brett funk, dark fruit, caramel, oak, and malt
Taste: Up Front: Lemon zest, white grape, malt. Finish: brett funk, oak at the end
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a light/medium carbonation. It got even creamier as it warmed up!
Drinkability: Tart, incredibly smooth, and refreshing! Does not get more drinakble than this?
Overall Impression: This was the first Wild Ale I've had since Victory's Wid Devil - a beer I disliked so much I almost dumped it. Almost. Having said that, I was unsure how this would beer would go over with me. Upon the first sip, my skepticism was gone! This is without a doubt the most complex beer/ale I've ever tasted!!! First the aging in Cabernet Sauvignon Barrels was obvious. The brett was a perfect compliment to the complexity of this amazing ale. It's kinda like a cross between a wine and a beer, and not a cheap version of either. If this is not Nectar of the Godz, I don't know what is. 1,016 charactersBeerGodz, Mar 02, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 002X3. I've had this before, but this is the first time I've had a bottle all to myself. 
Poured into a thin Ommegang goblet. Burnt red with a tan head that recedes to a thin ring. 
Rush of apple orchard aroma as soon as I pop the cork. Apple and a lot of grape from the cabernet barrels. Smells powerfully vinous with some leathery Brett character as well. 
One sip...yes indeed, this is still one of the best sours out there. Actually, to simply call it "a sour" is to do it a bit of disservice. It's sour, but only moderately so, blending very well with the woody vanila, dak fruit and wine tannins. Generally on the dry side, but this particular bottle is slightly sweeter than I remember it being. That's OK, though, I'm not complaining. ABV-wise, you do sense that this is a huge beer at 10%, but you don't really taste it. Warming and in the aftertaste, a goosey/fishy character that I sometimes get with big cabernets.
Airy, spiky feel. A little acidic burn on the way down the gullet.
At this level, drinkability is pretty good, though it certainly will take some time to down the 750. 1,105 charactersPatrick999, Feb 28, 2010

Many thanks to guinnessdoc for his efforts in getting this bottle. You went out of your way for me, Josh, and I won't forget it. 
Consecration pours a dark cherry color. It's very clear and looks a little scarlet with backlighting. An active, tan head covers the top. It simmers down quickly and leaves very little lace behind. 
The nose is interesting. Initially, it smells quite vinous and features strong grape and cherry notes. Light dark fruit notes of raisin and prune are noted. There's even a bit of a berry scent noted. Oak is very prominent. Suffice it to say that its aging in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels made quite the impact. It smells earthy and musky, but the presence of Brett isn't overly apparent. There's a mild funky smell, but it's subtle. Alcohol is masked very well. I'm not getting much for a 10% beer. Bottom line - Consecration is very deep, complex, and delicious smelling. 
The flavor keeps the pace. It kicks off with an explosive mix of berries, dark fruits, and sour cherry. It's a phenomenal combo. There's a sour, vinegar-esque flavor, but it's only moderate in terms of intensity. I wouldn't characterize it as ultra-sour. Oak adds a lot of character to the flavor. Earthy and musky notes linger throughout. Brett adds a touch of funkiness to the mix, but it plays a bit part in this grand act. Saying the flavor profile is deep and complex is really an understatement. But, it's impressive in that all of those flavors shine. It's not convoluted at all. Everything comes through. Alcohol is a little noticeable, but isn't strong by any stretch. This is very impressive stuff.
The body feels light/medium. Carbonation is active, but the bubbles feel light. It's very creamy and smooth. Drinkability is as high as it gets, especially for a Wild Ale of its stature. This stuff goes down like a dream. It's difficult to sip because it's so damn tasty. 
I approached Consecration with quite a bit of skepticism. I recall hearing how much it blurred the line between wine and beer. Personally, I don't think that's the case. It's very much a beer, and that's not a close question. It has some vinous qualities, but they complement its Wild Ale qualities rather than compete with them. Russian River really has a special creation with Consecration. I don't know how the other batches stack up, but this one's a dandy. Do yourself a favor and seek it out. 2,400 charactersprototypic, Feb 27, 2010

A: Deep crimson hue with a thick off-white head that settles rather quickly. Lacing and head retention are minimal, as expected, but carbonation is fierce.
S: Barnyardy funk shows up first, but it's soon overtaken with some sour currant, caramel malt, and toasted oak. Hops are almost non-exixtent here.
T: Much like the aroma, but more. Hints of cherry, cassis, and spice dominate, while caramel-like malt lies behind. The brett adds earthiness, along with some funk. It's what I would call "terroir driven." Finish is quite tart, dry, and the influence of cabernet can be noticed.
M: Rather full-bodied for the style. However, one wouldn't notice it's strength just by sipping it. Flavors are complex, and the finish lasts a lifetime.
D: I could drink this one everyday if I had access to it. It's probably in my top five brews of all time. If beers were to be classified like wines, this would truly be be at the top tier. Russian River is the Domaine Leroy or DRC of beer. 1,140 charactersWYVYRN527, Feb 26, 2010

It has a mild sourness in the nose along with a nice barrel aged aroma. The crystal malts seem to mellow the overall sourness. The taste is more laid back as well. It's easy drinking. I cannot believe this is a 10% abv. beer. I could drink this all night. It has a more moderate sourness than Beatification. It's also a darker beer with some crystal malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is very drinkable. It's tasty and not overly "wild". 605 charactersWesWes, Feb 21, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 3
A- Poured into a Bruery tulip glass, Consecration pours a clear, deep reddish-brown color. A flash of hissing off-white foam quickly dissolves to a bubbly ring along the inside of the glass, leaving no lacing behind. 
S- Acidic tartness is backed by pronounced notes of oak barrel and red wine. The black currants impart a nice dark fruit character to the aroma and the high alcohol content yields a touch of heat. There's a slightly vegetal, earthy quality to the smell that I can't quite pin down. 
T- The taste is intensely sour, though it's more of a citrus fruit sourness accented by vinegar. Notes of oak barrel and earthy red wine break through the puckering tartness right before a lightly dry finish leaves flavors of ripe dark fruits on the palate. The initial sourness is far more intense than Supplication or Temptation, but this sourness tapers off quicker as the backing flavors take over. The 10% ABV is well-hidden.
M- The feel is full-bodied with a good amount of active carbonation bubbles. 
D- The flavor is sublime, but Consecration lays a bit heavier on the stomach than Russian River's other sours due to the 10% ABV, the highly acidic sourness, and the richer dark fruit element. Still, I was easily able to navigate my way through two large pours of this complex beer. 1,305 charactersTdizzle, Feb 21, 2010

Minimal head, quick dissipation, no lacing to speak of. Dark amber body. Faint dried fruit in the nose, little hop presence. Taste is of tart dried cherries, no noticeable hops, a bit of funk (Brett?) pucker powered brew. Dry attentuated finish. At this ABV not sessionable, one is enough, but quite drinkable. Not quite in the league of Cascade Brewing/Raccoon Lodge, but this was a very tasty sour, certainly worth seeking out for fans of the style. 525 charactersjdense, Feb 20, 2010

Batch 001X3
Acquired in a trade with BrewerB
Served in a tulip
The beer poured a nearly clear, chestnut brown color with orangey-red tinges when held to the light. The frothy, bubbly, light tan, one-finger head displayed terrific retention. Drops of lacing cascaded down the sides of the glass with each sip. 
The aroma instantly hit me with a blast of tartness. Quite sour and acidic. Dark, woody and slightly leathery. Berry-like. A touch musty and funky, but the funk was rather restrained (compared to the sourness).
The flaxor profile was quite similar to the nose. Earthy and fruity with distinct oaky, red wine-like notes. (Apparently this was from the Cabernet Sauvignon barrel aging.) Super tart, particularly on the back end. Acidic with notes of balsamic vinegar. A subtle, berry flavor was also noticeable. The finish was very oaky, tannic and dry. As the beer warmed, some caramel malt sweetness appeared up front. 
The mouthfeel was light and fluffy. Creamy and frothy with a crisp, sprightly effervescence.
Despite the intense, acidic sourness of this brew, I found it to be quite drinkable. Frankly, I was blown away by the fact that this is a 10% ABV wild ale. Quite impressive alcohol masking. 
Although I enjoyed this beer, it was not quite as full-flavored or as complex as I was hoping it to be. Regardless, this is another noteworthy release from Vinny and company at Russian River. 1,456 charactersDamian, Feb 18, 2010

This is a great beer for catching wine enthusiast's or non-beer believers off guard in what they think a beer can be. Glass is filled carefully and slowly to the lip, leaving no room for a head and initially served a little too cold. Color is a murky, reddish brown, fairly clear and viscous looking. Strong vinous aroma, balanced and alternating oaky, mild vanilla sweetness with acidic funky dark fruit sourness. Flavor is deep, dark and complex. At colder temps the sour and funky dominates ripe apple, cider-like, tart cherries, berries, Brett-funk, etc. Warming up this becomes much more complex as the sweeter wood flavors reveal themselves and turn this into even more of a sipper. Sharp mouthfeel, fuller bodied and moderate carbonation and lingering finish, relatively dry. I still prefer Supplication to this, but that's not really a bad thing. Not easiest to approach of the RR wilds if you're not a fan of the style, but if you are this is exceptional. 1,107 charactersyourefragile, Feb 16, 2010

Beautiful dark red color, quite similar to the bottle. No head whatsoever. Very unique looking beer. 
Smell is black cherry a little booze, overall surprisingly subtle, and I would have expected a little more funk. 
Taste is much like the smell, black cherry with great smooth sourness up front. Hardly any funk present. Finishes with complex sourness and a subtle aftertaste. 
Surprisingly fizzy, the texture that you would expect from a 10% beer. You can smell the alcohol, but it is completely masked in the flavor. 
I have yet to fully enjoy a sour experience, so maybe its just not my thing. 659 charactersYOOJ, Feb 15, 2010
4.86/5  rDev +10.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a murky, Hellish red colour, brown mostly but with an ominous red tinge. Modest beige head sinks to a rim at the top. Lace is fairly nice, sticky sheets but not very clingy. Bit of cloud in the body. Nice colour, otherwise fairly impressive.
Lots of character on the nose - mostly sweet, with lots of fruit, berries and currants on there. A very sweet, almost creamy character comes up behind, a bit of caramel sweetness, some light toffee and some light milk chocolate notes. Also on there is funk, a hint of leather, pongy brie, barnyard animal notes. Lots of oak as well, and even some vanilla. Funk is slight - just a nice whisper lingering at the back of the nose, which is not just very nice - it's divine in fact. Superbly complex but balanced, just gives a lot without demanding. Incredible.
Taste is sour all over that. Starts off quite acidic, with a sharp citric twang to it, and the flavour of that continues to the mid without ever going overboard and being puckering, or painful. It's almost like the mid is 'cut off' by the flavour of the currants, which comes through fairly late but just in time it seems to clip off the puckering sourness. Really impressive effect with tart, underripe berries on the front, really seems painful, then a sweet-but-tart currant character and plenty of rich, fruity flavours on the back - prunes and currants and a big brandy alcohol warmth. Hints of oregano and other mixed herbs as well complete a really excellent, interesting palate profile. It gives you all the power of the funk but without the intensity or harshness. A challenging brew, but very, very enjoyable.
Slick and dry on the feel, really. Lots of body but never thick or syrupy, goes down well and although the puckering flavour is so expertly cut off, the sensation is still there, and the mouth feels a little sucked dry at the end. Good for the style though.
An excellent, extremely thirst-quenching, interesting, pleasant, beer. I could go on. An excellent choice to be my #500 review. 2,015 characterslaituegonflable, Feb 12, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Brought back from California wrapped safely in my luggage, cracked open with my bro @LaitueGonflable to celebrate his 500th review on BeerAdvocate.
Pours a dark deep blood red colour, dark grape-juice with a filmy tan head that collapses very quickly. Lots of carbonation swirling up through the depths, which makes the beer look alive, with a nice bead. Looks very heavy in the glass as well, although the carbonation is large-bubbled. Looks very decent.
Big vinous notes on the nose - lots of tannic red wine, tobacco leaf, dark curranty fruits and a hint of musty oak. Slight funk coming off it as well - although the acidity isn't present here, there's a whiff of barnyard and ripe cheese on the nose. Altogether, it's a wonderfully refined nose, sweet subtlety bouncing off rambunctious wildness.
Extremely long and full palate, starting with vinous acidity backed with earthy oak and tannic tobacco leaf. Port like heat seems to well slightly as the palate continues, leaving a warm booze note. Just when you think that's the end, up comes the berry-like currant note flushing its sweet-sour finish like warmed Christmas pudding over the palate. It is ever threatening to burst to extremes, but everything holds everything else together and it just rampages down the middle ground, never veering too far one way or the other. Coupled with this is the complex mouthfeel, that lingers through crewy and ripe at the start, almost touching harsh heat as the alcohol note comes through, before finishing with a cleansing, slightly puckering note. I've possibly never had a beer with a longer and more expressive palate - the fact that long after the beer is gone, there is still a dance of different characters developing is absolutely sublime. The complexity is amazing - the way the palate develops after each sip is absolutely stunning.
This is an absolutely exceptional beer. There's no getting around it. This beer proves why American Wild Ale is a unique style, and why it is such a well-regarded one at that. It also cements in my mind Russian River as an exceptional brewery. The complexity is incredible - I can't believe how much there is going on. Let's just put it bluntly, this is a really, really, really good beer. 2,234 characterslacqueredmouse, Feb 12, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Light, almost Red-copper, lightens up to a more golden brown when in direct light. Tried in a snifter
S: Initial sour tones. Replaced with definite oaky wine signatures. Fruity smells interlaced as well. After opening up the richness of the oaky-wine and fruit aromas become more prevalent, blends with the alcohol
T: Sour-sweetness overrides all first flavors and sensations. As is opens up the oak and cabernet remnants become nicely apparent and equalize the sour beginning.
	NOTE: Truly my initial impression was shock. The sourness was so strong that I almost fell aghast. Yet, with patience its true oak and cabernet personality began to show itself. Sweeter taste after breathing 
Mouthfeel: The lack of strong carbonation is taken over by the sourness and tannins from the oak conditioning. Again, after opening up the richness becomes more apparent, but never surpasses the sour blast. The alcohol did not produce strong warmth
Drinkability: This beer was my first funky American Wild Ale that was conditioned in cabernet oak casks. The sourness was honestly overpowering at first, both through the smell and taste (more so with the taste). However, as the beer opened up the aromas firstly became very exciting and did the beer's conditioning absolute justice. The taste took longer to come around, but as I began to realize the complexity I wanted nothing but more. 1,383 charactersAPetitfils, Feb 10, 2010

Batch 001x4
Pours a pretty much clear burgundy ruby color, with a off white head that starts out at about two fingers but fizzles out very quickly, leaving no lacing behind. Good color, and the lack of head is understandable.
The nose is intensely sour and tart, with a nice woody character, and a light funk in the background. A nice, acidic sourness fuels this beast and is definitely the focal point. As it warms, the English Barleywine-like maltiness of the base beer comes out ever so slightly.
As soon as it hits your lips, the blast of acidic burn hits you like a wall. Intensely sour and mouthpuckeringly tart. Tart cherries with a nice woodyness. The bugs have definitely been working hard in this one. The huge malty base beer comes out more in the taste than it did in the nose, tastes like an aged Barleywine.
Mouthfeel is light to medium, with a mouthpuckering sourness. Drinkability is dangerous, as the 10% is hidden very well.
Overall, a very good sour beer. A sipper, and one to enjoy over the course of an hour or more. Savor this one, enjoy it. I look forward to trying more of this in the future. Thanks Sean! 1,314 charactersMistofminn, Feb 09, 2010

A: Moderate pour yields a 3 finger light reddish-chocolate head that shrinks quickly. Beer is a crystal clear purple and leaves no lacing.
S: Woody funk, grape, fresh red fruit, slightly boozy. Pretty typical of RR sours and I can see how this is like a "cousin" of Temptation. Sharp, distinct constrast with the other beer.
T: Sweet, fresh red grapes, tartness throughout. Slightly boozy as it travels to the middle of the throat. Oaky tones are strong throughout along with a funk and Brett flavor. The whole experience is very deep here and the best way to describe it is this is as close to wine as I've had from a beer. 
M: Light to medium bodied, dry, lingering and watery. Sourness is puckering and it really gets the saliva in the mouth flowing. Puckeringly sour though this isn't a one shot hit your face sour, this is a drag it out, continually pounding sourness... 
D: Highly enjoyable. For me, this is strictly better than Temptation though both are solid beers. Deeper and more complex and I enjoy the dark fruit overtones in this one. Worthy of the praise. Seek it out!! 1,265 charactersSpeedwayJim, Feb 01, 2010

Taste: While its full frontal sour without a doubt, this is tempered by incredibly juiciness....grapes, apples, plums. There's even some banana flavor. A bit of spiciness and low lying woodiness and dryness add interest. No alcohol presence. Finish is very, very fruity, slightly oaky and slightly dry.
Notes: Like a great Cabernet but sweeter, fruitier, and more delicious. 499 characters4000qtrap, Jan 31, 2010

Sourness is evident in the aroma from the first whiff. Apple cider vinegar mixed with brown sugar and fermented berries. Wow, this tastes amazing. Tons of sour, tart cherries, berries, citric acid and vinegar. This is backed up by a dark sugar, caramely malt base with what seems like a hint of vanilla and a bit of spice. Also has a bit of a red wine like quality. Quite tasty and begging for another sip. Fairly full bodied with a somewhat sticky finish. The sour helps balance off the sweetness in the finish. Also worth mentioning that for being it goes down quite smooth. Cannot detect the 10% ABV at all. For the style I would say this is quite drinkable.

Shared with my wife and poured into my New Belgium tulip glass (also courtesy of vasdef42). We've been stuck on this Wild Ale kick and have enjoyed trying several new beers!
This one presents a dark copper pour leaving a bit of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Against the wishes of Russian River, I swirl the good stuff and top off my glass. A light brown two-finger head is perched atop this brew and the sediment muddies it, and the rest of the beer, just a bit. When held to the light, the beer shines a deep red. 
The smell was surprisingly mild. Not as much funk as I would expect, but I could definitely get a whiff of the sour. Hints of dark red fruits with vinous tendencies.
The taste is an intense tart and sour. The red wine is definitely there, as well as the dark fruit. A lighter medium-bodied beer that has a divine lingering astringency. It ended up being a bit much for my wife...but that just means more for me. The 10% alcohol was not detectable at all. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer...seems to be commonplace for Russian River.

After I opened the bottle, I went to put the corkscrew away and could smell the beer from 10 feet away. Smells of sour cherries, currants, vinegar, oak, and some vanilla. So far, this is hands down the best tasting sour ale I have had. The taste matches the smell almost perfectly, except the vinegar is muted, and the cherries are more tart than sour. 
Finishes dry, with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. The alcohol is well hidden for 10%. Light, fizzy carbonation, and medium bodied. Very smooth for a sour or wild ale. Very drinkable. 614 charactershardy008, Jan 29, 2010

Pours a deep, clear garnet. A light beige head rises up and fizzles away immediately - and I do mean immediately. I barely had time to note the color before it was gone. Ah well, that's expected in a big sour like this one. Holding the beer up to the light, there are the most beautiful shimmering golden highlights. Beautiful.
Smell is good. I believe that I am sensing a pattern where my lowest score for my reviewed beers tends to be on the aroma. I don't know why that is - but often I wish that the aroma was more in my face. That's the case here. I am getting plenty of sour fruit here, mostly currants, red berries and perhaps a bit of raisin and cherry. Smells sour. A hint of the barrels, and I can detect red wine from the cabernet. Very inviting, if not as robust as I would like ideally.
Taste is superb. Massive sour fruit kick, currants and berries mostly. This is sour, but not puckeringly so - there is a sweetness that offsets it nicely. Tannic, oaky. Excellent.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Robust. Especially full mouthfeel for the style. The lack of head belies the active carbonation. 
I drank a full 750 of this two nights ago, and I'm doing it again tonight. This is INSANELY drinkable for a 10% American Wild. Insane.

Pourned a murky reddish brown with a soda fizz head that dissipated as quickly as it formed. Smell was really great. Deep musty wood, a hint of barnyard and sour fruit. Taste rivaled the tartness of La Folie, bracingly sour. I couldn't believe it. A healthy dose of barnyard funk intermingled with red wine tannins and oak wood. Almost spicy. Outstanding. Mouthfeel was light, not too fizzy but kept a nice sour tartness on the tongue. Not thin by any means. Drinkablility was pretty good although it was a little rough getting the last bit down. I could feel the glands in my jaw start to swell a little bit, and my mouth was getting pretty dry from all the tartness, but didn't change the amazingness of this beer. 10%? No way. 809 charactersFweezle, Jan 27, 2010
4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Out of a bottle, provided by a BA member, this beer was a murky, copper color. The head was similar to the color of toasted wood, the retention was ok as a thin collar and the lacing in spots. The aroma was big and sweet with dark fruits, grapes and raisins, currants, sweet dough, alcohol and candied fruit. Like an alcohol infused fruitcake! The flavors were very similar to the aroma but aggressively tart. Highly acidic which was further pronounced by the alcohol punch and I tasted the additions of kirsch as well as some funky, musty wood. The currants truly came through on the finish giving the brew a unique character. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation light/medium. For 10% it was very drinkable and an excellent example of the variety and complexity available within the American Wild Ale style. 832 charactersthekevlarkid, Jan 26, 2010
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5An impromptu Consecration vertical broke out at a recent tasting, we were able to sample batch 1, 2, and 3 side by side. I am happy to report that they are very similar. 
Batch 001 - Beer is brown and clear, there is no head and only slight carbonation. The aroma is a mixture of sweet and sour (but not of the Chinese food variety). Really great sour / tart flavor with a hint of malt in there, really shocking. Beer finishes slightly dry overall. There is also a hint of oak and funk at the end, very slight.
Batch 002 - Again, it is clear and brown but this time the carbonation a lot higher. Large bubbles rise through the beer quickly, still no head. The aroma is slightly sweeter but is still very sour. The beer has the same sour notes at the batch 001, in fact they are pretty much the exact same flavor but this one has a slight bitterness to it. I think the bitterness helps accent the oak flavors in the back.
Batch 003 - This one appears slightly lighter than the other two, but just slightly. Still brown and clear. Not as bitter as the Batch 002 but just as sour. Some oak notes in the back.
Overall this is a top notch sour, one of my favorites by a lot. All three were great and I would have them again. 1,223 charactersdrabmuh, Jan 25, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I am just beginning to venture into the world of sour and this is going to keep me here for sure.
A pop and some whisps of smoke on taking the cork out. Poured a brown hue with some amber highlights when held up to the light. Vigorous pour brought about a fizzy head that dissappeared very quickly. Lots of carbonation at first that settled down into a playful dance of bubbles.
My nose was first hit with a vinegar sourness, but in a good way. Also scents of green apple and cherry. At this point I was a little intimidated.
The first taste is almost mouth puckering, but then the crisp and sweet green apple flavor kicked in. Also some sour cherry notes in there. Finally a dry woody finish. Very vinous in its qualities.
Mouthfeel was medium bodied and crisp. The carbonation was wonderful, adding another amazing aspect to this beer. It's amazing that it has taken me this long to venture into sour beers or anything from RR for this long. Definately an amazing treat. 976 characterssnpub540, Jan 25, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Batch 002x01
Appearance: Pours a tawny brown with, dare I say it, currant highlights; the beer opened with an explosive sound and, though I feared a gusher, it poured with a nice head that dissipated rather quickly, leaving the occasional splotch of lace
Smell: Sour balsamic vinegar, toned down with sweeter elements of cherries, currants and a massive quantity of oak and leather
Taste: Starts out sweet but puckery with developing sour fruit flavors of currants, figs, green apples and tart cherries as well as leather, cocoa and loads of horseblanket; after the swallow, the wood really comes through to complement the potpourri of flavor into the long, persistent finish
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, silky smooth, with a puckering mouthfeel but relatively low carbonation
Drinkability: A stunningly bold achievement; may be the best thing Russian River produces 868 charactersbrentk56, Jan 23, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml cork-in-cage bottle, courtesy of Murchmac. Thanks, Tim!
The well-rested, cellar-cool bottle yields its stopper with a vigorous *poof* and a high-speed blast of funky fruitiness. Poured into my Maredsous goblet, Consecration is quite clear when held before the light and ruby-hued amber in color. This barrel-aged beauty sports an effervescent, quick-fading cap of grainy beige foam, and active carbonation roils continuously to the surface. A soft sheet of slumping non-stick lacing follows the liquid to its terminus at the bottom of the glass.
The aroma is pungently fruity with a mildly acidic malt-vinegary edge. Notes of cherry, sugary dates, soft green leaves, and a snap of spice are cleanly accented with dry oak and a drop of vanilla.
The taste is crisply fruity with a musky, tannic, vinegary bite. Notes of tangy cherry-laced cider vinegar are grounded in a mild earthy funk and sharpened with a splash of naked acidity, tooth-squeaking tannins, and a big fat dose of lively carbonation. The profile is propped up with a cool dry oakiness laced with vanilla that lingers long into the aftertaste. Successive pours with increasing amounts of lees in suspension offer a growing notion of woody nuttiness, and a touch of soft dark fruits and a pleasantly-buggy note of dank, muddy, twangy wildness accent the entire experience.
The drink is light-medium in body with vivacious carbonation. The fluffy, refreshing, tangy nature of the brew belies the otherwise invisible 10% ABV and lends itself to being quaffed more quickly than is likely advisable. Good stuff, Murch, and thanks again! 1,606 characterscvstrickland, Jan 20, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml bottle Batch 001x2. Acquired in a trade and has been aging in my cellar since. Poured into a snifter. Consumed last night.
A-Body is a very hazy translucent medium mahogany hue. Pours with an approximately 1 finger foamy off-white head but this quickly fades pretty quickly leaving only a thin collar.
S-Nose has a very pungent acidic tartness from and is all that I noticed initially. With a deeper look aromas of oak, cigars, red wine, and cherry pits are also noted.
T- Much like the nose the flavor initially is dominated by a sharp acidic sourness all the way through with a very clean finish. With a deeper look and as one becomes more accustomed to the sourness the oak barrel flavor comes through as well as red wine and tobacco-more so with the finish than initially. Its interesting because the more you sip the more complex the beer becomes and the more you notice. The slightest alcohol
M- Exceptionally smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation. Body is thick, velvety smooth, and rich.
D- Wow. This is another excellent sour from the folks at Russian River. Delicious, rich, and complex. This beer has aged very well so far and is certainly a slow sipper. This should definitely be shared- 750ml is too rich for one person in one sitting. This is a beer that I would love to have again. 1,314 charactersPittBeerGirl, Jan 18, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I poured this one from a 750ml brown bottle into a stemmed goblet. This bottle was from "Batch 3", sent to me by the great BA Schmittymack.
A= Poured a very clear deep reddish brown color with a short lived 1/2" off-white head. There was a ton of active carbonation release...a constant stream of gas rising out of this brew. 
S= A heady, complex array of malt, lactic sourness, brett funk, fruity sweetness, wood, red wine, and hints of chocolate and tobacco. Entirely captivating.
T= Every bit as good as the smell if not better. The acidic sourness was there throughout, but was never overpowering. Lots of malt sweetness and what I believe was a bit of candi sugar made it through to the taste buds. Complex fruity/tart notes of currants & cherries. The wild yeast components gave flavors of light vinegar and a refreshing edge. I was particularly happy with the hints of oak and red wine still lingering in the taste. Subtle yet delicious. Finished dry, tart, and crisp. 
MF= Medium bodied with a very active and crisp carbonation. Entirely refreshing to the mouth.
D= This was balanced, complex, and extremely refreshing. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV. A world class beer for sure! 1,196 charactersspointon, Jan 18, 2010
4.51/5  rDev +2.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 3 (002X3).
Clear chestnut brown with a fizzy/soapy, short-lived beige cap. It looked a lot like a glass of Coke, with not much head or lace to speak of. It was a light gusher too, so watch out. Aromas of tobacco leaf, cherries, berries, currants, earthy with a light funk, red wine, strawberry seeds, hint of cocoa. More earthiness as it warms. The flavour was a combination of fruity and earthy, chocolate covered raisins, berries/currants, a bit tart but very pleasant and non-aggressive in this character. Faint vinegar, light woody oak, green berries. Mild alcohol and warmth in the finish with a lingering berry sweetness. Medium bodied and off-dry, moderate carbonation after the initial loss of aggressive carbonation (it took about 20 minutes to clear from the bottle), a bit of woody astringency. I really liked this one. Nicely balanced with complex fruit flavours. 881 charactersDrJay, Jan 17, 2010
4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Santa justn for sending this my way.
Bottle split three way's among friends in tulip glasses. It had a slight head off white that just went away. The body of the brew was a red to brown.
The aroma was by far the best sour I have smelled in a while there were currants, chocolate covered cherries and funk. This is one complex brew. it had a light carbonation but If I was to hand it to some of my European relatives the would immediately think this was some sort of carbonated red wine. It was fruity and slightly tart to the taste. This is a great wild one of the best I have had.
Drinkability was what I expected. I took my time with the brew and enjoyed every drop and a hour after the glass was gone I wanted more.
It's a world class brew from a world class brewer 780 charactersjoepais, Jan 16, 2010
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4750 mL bottle courtesy of bmanning. Batch 002x3, poured in to a snifter. 
Appearance: Pours a dark cognac-hued - sort of a orange raisin, a slightly-hazed burnt amber - that's clear enough in a vacuum that you can see some cloudy, suspended yeast when you hold this attractive beer up to the light. The head is precisely what you would expect on a 10% wild ale - it's eruptive, fizzy, and fades as quickly as it rises up. I'd estimate that it lasts in any significant form a mere fifteen seconds, and at least ten of that is supported on the backs of thousands of small, mercurial bubbles. The effervescence on this bottle is fierce, but that much was obvious from the pop of the cork - it ultimately fades down to a more controlled, lackadaisical, less dense, but still consistent, even though by this point it's only supporting the thinning, balding ring of fuzz around the rim of the glass. The lacing is again what you'd expect from a beer of this style, glittery, and largely runny, with only frail, thin tendrils clinging ever so infrequently. 
Aroma: I served this one relatively warm, but give it even more time to warm to let it truly shine. The base beer is wonderfully rich, decadent even, and you can smell its pungency even beyond the swarm of Brett notes - huge caramel, rum-soaked raisins, buttery toffee, and faint boozy alcohol provide the base for an amazing array of complex, interlacing tart, sour, fruity, and lactic notes. The lactic notes intermingle with the slightly buttery notes and the caramel sugars in the base beer - dulce de leche? - but that's almost an afterthought in this aroma. Tart fruity notes are dominated by the currants, but the tartness lends apples, pears, strawberries, raspberries, and melons. And don't forget the slightly funky, moderately and faintly cheesy Brett note, the vinous tannins, nor the moderately woody, toasty barrel notes. 
Taste: It's taking me a while to get ahold of what I'm tasting here. The base beer is more well hidden here than it was in the nose, or I suppose a better way to put it would perhaps be that I taste sour more pungently than I smell sour. Or something. The sweetness is nonetheless potent, showcasing brown sugar, huge caramel notes, and dark fruit sugars. Slightly acetic, acidic sourness intermingles with a huge, vastly complex array of fruit notes - kiwi, green apples, currants, plums, red grapes - and the slew of green, vinous, leafy, tannin-y, and wooden notes. Some thick, barnyardy Brett beautifully accompanies the lactic sourness here, and the mild alcohol note that's here is well buried under the sweet'n'sour combo. The Brett and sweetness intensifies as it warms, enhancing the sweet side of the sweet'n'sour duo, rendering a darker, more savory beer - indeed, as it hits warm temperature, I'd say it's about a 1:1 ratio.
Mouthfeel: Unbelievably soft. A seemingly irrelevant but really not-so-much anecdote: my favorite band is Steely Dan, and my favorite thing about Steely Dan is how their music - oftentimes showcasing complex compositions with bright, competent instrumental work and upbeat tempos - is juxtaposed against their lyrics, which can range from perverse to downright morbid. The mouthfeel of this beer is the Steely Dan of mouthfeels. After the initial blast of carbonation has fallen off (during which time it's, yes, admittedly a little explosive, uneven, fluffy), this is a smooth, gentle brew, which is wonderfully juxtaposed with the sweetly pungent and sourly potent one-two kick that the flavor profile of this brew is all about. It's quite the dichotomy, but the seemingly inharmonious combination works wonders on the palette.
Drinkability: There was a time not too long ago when I'd have rated the taste and aroma of this one well below the mouthfeel and appearance. Sours have grown on me since then, and this is one of the best I've had. The sweet and sour combo almost reminds me of an Oud Bruin in places, but there's enough sourness here that it falls firmly in the right place (and it's also probably not purely funk enough). It's hard for me to give anything that's 10% abv a drinkability that's too high, ergo the score on this one, but it's still pretty amazing. This one seems like one you couldn't age too terribly long without it getting violently carbonated, but I would have liked the pure Brett on this one to be a little more pungent (something that would only come with additional age) - I'd love to try Batch 001 right around now, or to get a current bottle and let it sit for 2, 3 years. A phenomenal brew, brimming with complexity, aromas, and flavors, this one would have paired well with some Roquefort or Stilton ... had I had any. Curses! 4,696 charactersCrellMoset, Jan 16, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a dark ruby with a foamy head that doesn't linger long and settles to a ring for the rest of the drink. Smell is of light sour note of currant. Taste is clean, sour, currant again with nice full oak flavor that balances well to the finish leaving a great aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good as well with pleasant carbonation, a great sour. Drinkablility is lower simply because of the 10% ABV but could easily have a couple of snifters of this. 444 charactersrwdkosak, Jan 15, 2010

Batch 001X2
Thin head with a deep brown brew that is pretty cloudy when held to a light.
Very rich aroma.. very fruity and only mildly funky... tart berries.. whaffs woodiness .. grape bubblegum or soda.. 
tannic berry skins and an abundant fruitiness... some black cherry essence... maybe even some black caps... more oak than the nose .. a little lactic ... some wet leather and wild strawberry essence shows as it warms ... fantastic body for a sour... carbonation seems abundant but helps balance the slightly heavier mouthfeel ... 
I still have a few bottles ... but I think some age is going to do wonders... Thanks again Brianne... You are a peach.

Pours a red wine like brownish purple hue with a small head. Funky, mildly vinous nose with some wood character and currant fruit. Wine-like, tannic and sour with no alcohol note apparent. Dry and very ripe with a fresh fruit note, the skin of the currant and the Cabernet barrels harmonize wonderfully. A truly nice beer, i was lucky enough to enjoy a little less than half of this bottle and enjoyed every sip thoroughly. This bottle is worth the 25$ charged, share it, for a full 25oz may be a bit much to the tongue. 534 charactersATPete, Jan 09, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The taste is of oakiness, dark fruits, currants, a lot of the wine flavors really come in. Smells amazing, its a lot like wine, but its well carbonated, infact when the cork came off it started overflowing immediately.
Poured into a stemless wide sniffer. The bubbles kept flowing up from the bottom of the glass once it was poured. Dark brown, little head that disappears quickly, little lacing. It has a tart and sour taste, its pretty sour, but its actually pleasant.
If you're a beer noob I'd probably wait a bit as there's a lot of complexity, keep trying other stuff, heavier stuff. Because I had my friend's sisters try it and they gave that puckering look from the sourness.
I can't really fault the beer, but $23 is a LOT of money for beer. If it was 10-12 bucks I'd pick it up all the time, but this is something you should try once.
I'm still going to go try the other Russian River sours as I come across them.

Pours a dark plum color with no head. White ring circles what appears to be a tasty wild beer!
Smell is James Brown Funky. We're talking "can I count it off?" kind of funk. 1, 2,3, 4, Brett, Sachh, Lacto, Pedio - hit me. Vinegar, lemon, and cherry join the funky foursome to make a great nose complete.
Taste is perfect. Seriously. Perfect. Deep sour backed with oak, dark fruits, tobacco, cabernet, and a touch of vinegar make this so deep and defined that there really is no comparison to other beers out there. This IS that good.
The brilliant, lively carb and finish combine with a great body to make this beer simply a pleasure to drink. Someone should let Maurice Sendak know, the Wild Things are at Russian River.

What does one do when he shows up to a bar looking for a quick $5 pint and stumbles upon a big, pricey bottle of Consecration? (That was a rhetorical question.)
A: The body is dark, murky & pruney-brown colored with a small bubbly head, light brown in color. It made an appearance and then, all at once, took off like it stole something. Interesting to say the least but I'm not at all impressed at this point.
S: Thank goodness...Nothing short of phenomenal! First and dominant aroma is the yeast bill which is heavy barnyard, sweat and meat. The bottle boasts of the brettanomyces, lactobacillus, saccharomyces & pediococcus, all wild yeast strains as far as I know. And why not? They combine to assist in one of the most uniquely aromatic brews I've ever tried. The malt and hops are hard to separate but I get hay/straw and flower respectively. An entire orchestra of fruit flavors: dark and ripe fruits of raisin, plum, red grape, currant & date provide the sweet flavors while the white grape & raspberry supplement with sour and tart. A bit of prune and dried fig come to mind as well. No mistaking the vinous nature of Consecration either. The oaky wood and earthy cabernet sauvignon components (plus hints of tobacco) are deep rooted.
T & M: The flavor duration is tantalizingly long and slow, making it impossible not to savor each sip. Moderately sweet and harshly acidic (but in a stimulating way). The mouthfeel is somewhere on another planet. The carbonation level is atmospheric. The finish is WILDLY astringent. The body is fuller than a woman in a 'plus-size' department store. I love it!!!
D: If I can drink an entire 750 by myself, you can too. 1,723 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Jan 03, 2010

The aroma is quite nice. The mouthwatering tart aroma of brett is screaming up front. 
There's some nice dark ripe fruits, caramel, apple, oak, and some of the cabernet barrels come through as well.
The taste is quite nice. There's some really nice darker malts giving caramel notes up front. There's also some nice fruit flavors and a fantastic showing of brett which just makes the mouth water for more. It's really fun and quite nice.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very high dose of carbonation which really sets the the beer off.
Drinkability is high. The flavor profile on this beer is fantastic which just brings you back for more. The abv is easily managed and well incorporated. All in all this is a really solid beer. 909 charactersGoliath, Jan 01, 2010

4.61/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 3
Aroma: A reasonably light aroma of sour ripe cherries and green apple skin. Little to no hop aroma. Slight hint of alcohol spice.
Appearance. Light mahogany brown with excellent clarity. Thin but lasting off white head holds a light lacing along the side of the glass.
Flavor: A sharp bite of green sour apple skin hits your tongue and cheeks with next to puckering sourness. As an ale brewed with Brettanomyces this is highly expected and enjoyed. The malt profile is hidden in the background until your tongue recovers from the sour bite, then there are complexities of bitter cherry and faint oak in the finish. This beer finishes extremely dry with another bite of sourness left on the lips as reminder.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with effervesant carbonation. There is a puckering sensation from the Brett but again this is expected and done well to enjoyment. Finishes crisp and very dry.
O: This beer is not for the weak of heart or mind. Among the sours Consecration Batch 3 is demonstrating the finer points of this brewing art. The sourness hits you on the tongue and in the jaw muscles like a sour apple with each refreshing sip. 1,149 charactersDanOLeary, Dec 31, 2009

T/M: The sour and tart flavors are really developing which is surprising given that this is a 10% sour. Lots of tart courants and under ripe apples. Some good funk going on with the leather and oak adding nice depth. Body is medium to medium light to strong carbonation... maybe a tad too strong.
D: Drinks amazing for 10% and keeps getting better with age. 640 characterspwoods, Dec 28, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5It's 11 AM PST and I was able to try this beer for the first time, being on the west coast. My only complaint is that 10% alcohol this early is going to catch up on me. 
Excellent beer. Dark brown, not opaque and very clear. The head is very fizzy, light golden brown, behaving like a sour typically behaves (fizzy). Flavor is excellent. The combination of oak, sour and currant blend into a perfect flavor that I will enjoy all day (hoping I'll sip it slowly).
If this were lower in alcohol, it might be a little more versatile but otherwise this is excellent and worth the $20 price tag. 591 charactersdavid18, Dec 25, 2009

Aged in wine barrels and carrying the flavors over into the finished product with a unique character added to the tartness of this beer. All the RR products are made to the highest of standards by one of craft beers true master brewers! I recommend trying all their brews if you can get your hands on them.. 376 charactershrking, Dec 25, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I am overwhelmed with appreciation for this tasty beverage. Pours dark amber/ruby (my lighting is not very good) with almost nonexistent white head. Feels very smooth in my mouth, and mouth-puckeringly sour. With grape, floral, and oak tones, it almost tastes like a fine red wine--maybe a Syrah?--and I mean that in a good way. 328 charactershopenator, Dec 25, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a brillant amber hue that is flat in color and appearence. No head at all with zero lace. Good for the style. The aromas are bold and big on wine. Tons of sour red fruit with hints of sweet tarts, funk, and cherry juice. Inviting. The sweet tarts come thru as does a bit of crushed aspirin. Beneath that is a wonderful mix of red fruit that is heavy on the cherries. Winey sourness pushes thru along with bits of wood, and vineous qualities. Medium in body, a bit sharp on the tongue with a dry finish. 508 charactersAnthony1, Dec 22, 2009
4.13/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Batch 001x4. 750 mL bottle, cage and mushroom cork presentation. Dark brown with blood red highlights in color with a restrained creamy tan head. The head is an anomaly for a sour in my experience, which usually seem to be paltry or enormous, but this one just sits and retention is rock-like in longevity.
Aroma is tart with red and dark fruit - currants, cherries, prunes. An almost candy-like sweetness is there as well, along with wild critters providing some lacto, pedio notes plus a spot of musty funk to round it out. Taste has a nice fruit and malt sweetness with currants and some tart cherry coming out of the woodworks. In congruence with the sweet cherry pie is a load of pedio driven sourness that peaks on the midpalate. A slight funk has accented the dark fruits in this after being cellared a year, reminding me of a new world tip of the hat to old world Flemish red style ales. Tart fruit and earthy finish. Feel is medium with a very delicate and luscious carbonation that again reminds me of some greats such as Rodenbach Grand Cru.
What have I learned here tonight? Like all the other Russian River sours, this one just gets better with age. I have never been a big of a fan of Consecration as most beer geeks have seemed to be, but after tasting this batch 1 some time later I think I may be converted. Really tasty, recommended for cellaring. 1,367 charactersvacax, Dec 21, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My 100th Review! I can't think of a better beer to review on this small milestone on BA.
Poured from a 750ml Bottle. Batch 002x3
Appearance - Poured into my RR sniffer with about a finger of quickly dissipating head which leaves little to no lacing. Held up to the golden yellow sun on its way down on the horizon, the beer lights up a brilliant cherry cola color, reminiscent of dark burgundy.
Smell - The distinct barnyard, sour funk immediately penetrates the air as I inhale deeply from the glass. Wet hay, leather, and earthiness. This is followed by the more sour/tart dark fruit smell such as under-ripe dark cherries and raisins. A lot going on but everything seems to fall into place.
Taste - Holy sour. The first sip my mouth instantaneously puckers up for what turns out to be a very interesting experience. Oak on the forefront followed by extreme tartness which make one envision biting into extremely under-ripe cherries. This wanes to the slight (not as prevalent as in the nose) barnyard funkiness that honestly is only there for a moment before I get a very strong black licorice ending flavor. This is odd - I have never so distinctly tasted, in my opinion, legitimate non-fake flavored black licorice spices in a drink. To say the least, it has taken me quite a few sips to sort out this beer. Thus far, everything I was expecting and more. Definitely more of a "darker" wine-like sour whereas Temptation seems much "lighter" in taste, body, and flavor. 
Mouthfeel - Dry, crisp, medium to high carbonation. Finishes tart and dry, making you reach for another sip.
Drinkability - This one is a sipper for sure. The extreme tart/sour/funk flavors make this a beer that is best enjoyed over a longer period of time. Don't get me wrong, this is quaffable no doubt, but there is no reason to do so. Additionally, the alcohol is well hidden and I get just a slight warming after each sip. A very enjoyable sour/wild ale. 1,939 charactersSpdKilz, Dec 20, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Euel for picking this up while in Cali.
Pours a beautiful dark reddish color with a small tan head. The head soon turns into a thin film which leaves little if any lacing.
The aroma soon fills the air with a mix of musty currants and cherries. The oak also makes it's presence known. A very inviting bouquet to be sure.
Taste follows the smell very closely, however the mustiness somewhat dulls the sharpness of the aroma. Nicely balanced, but not nearly as tart/sour as I had expected. The alcohol is extremely well hidden.
The mouthfeel was somewhat on the thin side, with minimal carbonation. Not the most exciting presence, but acceptable for a beer of this style.
This was one of the more enjoyable sour beers I've had in a while. The oak aging really makes this beer what it is. Worth a try if you can find it at a good price. 847 charactersJBogan, Dec 19, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from tap at Capones sour event into a small tasting glass.
A: A darker reddish brown with tiny off white small head. No glass lacing.
S: Sour fruits with some slight notes of wood. 
T: Ok, here is where this beer shines. What a complex array of sour fruits that are just sheer mouth puckering. The dominant fruit flavor I could not pick out, but I assume it's current since that is what the bottle says (I've never had currents). So sour currents, apple, grape and maybe some raspberry coupled with some oaky woody and vanilla flavors. A hint of sweetness is there to offset the tart flavors, but this is far from sweet. Funny thing is I don't get any yeasty flavors or funk, just the sour. Hops come in at the end to bitter the finish. Wow, hella lot going on here.
M: Full, prickly, coating, puckering with just a hint of alcohol.
D: Medium to good for such a sour beer.
Overall this is so different, but so good. If you love wilds/sours, this beer is for you. Complexity really makes this beer a one of a kind. Very nice, glad I got to try such a rare beer on tap. 1,080 charactersKadonny, Dec 17, 2009
4.04/5  rDev -8.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5750 ml bottle that was corked and caged. On this bottle is a large burgundy colored label of a knife with black lines running all of it and the number 23 near the tip. It's a zebra knife! At the bottom is a brief description of the beer and in the right hand corner is a barrel with 6 months in the middle and 4 scientific names surrounding the barrel. To the far left is Russian River's address and to the far right is everything you want to know about this beer. That's where you'll find the Government warning, phone number of R.R., a batch number, a picture of the correct glassware, and a novel sized history and description of the beer. They also threw in the definition of Consecration in case you didn't know what it meant. Before I forget, this bottle was from batch 002X3.
Appearance: With a loud pop of the cork followed by gun smoke, this beer erupted like a volcano. It's a good thing I opened the bottle near the sink and my glass. Due to this eruption, I lost about 1/4 of the bottle. Once I finally got some of the beer into my wide rimmed Unibroue Tulip, I saw that Consecration was not what it appeared to be. From a short distance away, I looked to pour a dark mahogany brown, but when held into the light, I found out that it was an extremely dark currant red with some raspberry red highlights. It was a little murky due to a few yeast particles floating around at the bottom of the glass. With this beer erupting like it did, surprisingly there wasn't much of a head of foam on this beer. The initial head of foam was 1/4 of an inch of just fizzy bubbles that disappeared in a blink of an eye. I shouldn't say it completely disappeared because it left behind a string of rings around the edge and a spot or two of lace. The head of foam that I was expecting must have flowed out of the bottle with the eruption. 
Smell: Now this is the aroma I was expecting from a sour R.R. beer! It wasn't an over the top sour aroma that made you cringe every time you took a whiff. it had its fair share of sour fruity aromas, but it never went over the top. It was pleasantly sour with currants, cherries, green and red grapes, and even raspberries. I'm surprised that my nose couldn't find any yeast in the aroma. Not even a subtle amount of yeast was found in here. When this beer is swirled around, that's when the oak with its friends the anise and black licorice comes out to play with all the sour fruits. A great potent sour aroma that wasn't over the top. It was perfect for this beer!
Taste: The taste of Consecration had something in common with the aroma. It too was all about the sour fruits. It wasn't an overly sour taste, but it was getting there. It was one sour fruit away from being overly sour. This beer was sour and tart with currants, green grapes, green apples, cherries, and raspberries. If you name a fruit that can either be sour or tart, then you'll find it in the taste. If you wait long enough for your taste buds to reach the end of the sour fruit wave, then you'll come across some charred oak and yeast. No anise or black licorice in the taste like there was in the aroma. I think that if there was, that would have made the beer a little more funkier. If you like your sour and tart fruits as much as I do, then wait till you wrap your lips around a glass full of this beer. 
Mouthfeel: This was a medium bodied sour and tart Wild Ale with a decent amount of carbonation and with a long lasting sour and tart aftertaste. The aftertaste was chock full of delicious sour fruits like currants, cherries, green grapes, and raspberries. I also noticed that there was a touch more yeast and oak in the aftertaste than there was in the initial taste. I felt that this beer really didn't show it's 10% ABV. You'll be distracted by all the sour fruits to notice the ABV%.
Drinkability: Russian River always does a great job on sour beers (as well as DIPAs) and Consecration is up there with the best of them. It started off with a bang with the bottle explosion, slowed down in the appearance, and then kicked into high gear with its top notch sour and tart aroma and taste. Of course, like every other Russian River Beer, it's expensive as hell! It's worth a shot once if you can pry open your wallet far enough. 4,251 charactersAltBock, Dec 04, 2009

 What is this?A dark brown clear liquid no head at all, beer?
 The aroma is perplexing, I would describe it as the insides of a discarded yeasty/moldy jar of raspberry jam.
 Taste is what it's about, YEE GADS thats sour, Like the best lemonaid you ever had,sour cherries, unripe apricots, strong carbonation hammers down the sour taste-buds until endorphins take over and calm everything down again, must have another taste, then another

4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 750mL bottle into a tulip. This was from batch 002X3.
Appearance: deep mahogany brown with reddish hints; two finger fizzy head which dissipated very quickly. 
Smell: very interesting; there's a lot going on here. Right off the bat, it smells like wood; there is also the aroma of currant and raisin and tobacco. There is a distinct tartness which I'm sure is attributable to the bacteria. Overall, I like it, although it doesn't necessarily whet my appetite for beer.
Taste: tart, bright and sour. The subtleties of the aroma eventually come through, but off the bat it reminds me of eating super-sour candy as a kid. The other flavors are not particularly strong; I like the tartness but it is a bit extreme. As I consume more of it, I find it growing on me.
Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a nice carbonation. I quite like it.
Drinkability: this beer perplexes me a bit. Each time I take a sip, the sourness blows me back; soon, however, I am appreciating the undertones, and finally I find myself yearning for another sip. This is a truly interesting beer. 1,079 charactersflagmantho, Nov 25, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is quite possibly my favorite Russian River beer. I absolutely love this one.
Pours a dark reddish brown in color. A very nice inch and a half of off white head forms on the pour. Smell is sour/tart and has a very nice vinous note as well.
Taste is off the charts incredible. This second batch bottle is more tart and sour than all the first batch bottles I have drank. I'm actually digging it more. Even with the more pronounced sour and tartness this beer is still every bit as drinkable as it always has been. The currants give a very nice vinous quality in the flavor.
Full, with perfect carbonation this is a pleasure to drink. One of my favorite beers of all time.
Well done and keep up the great work Vinnie! 720 charactersFtownThrowDown, Nov 25, 2009

Appearance - The color was a deep dark amber, surprisingly clear. Lighter head with a lack of lacing.
Smell - Complex with initial sweetness slowly enveloped by a fruity (raisin), and bready smell with a strong funk ensuing. The sour funk (which I described as barnyard) was not too overwhelming, but quite pleasant)
Taste - The first sip knocked me off my feet. Many layers of flavors - Amazing layers of sweetness/funkiness/mild malt. Tart/sour funk very apparent after first sip - wonderfully balanced - the sweetness was very strong, more so than expected but well balanced with the sour funk and malt and countless other tastes words cannot portray. Wine character and oak evident from aging.
Mouthfeel - Generally high carbonation but not unpleasant. Sweet and full considering.
Drinkability - Lovely beer - one of the most drinkable soured beers I have ever tried. Will gladly recommend to experienced beer lovers and inquiring minds concerning innovative soured beers. Go Russian River go! 1,137 charactersZaplt, Nov 24, 2009

4.2/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Barrel aged 6 months in oak with currants. Brett, sacc, pedio, and lacto cultures. Batch 002x2. Maroon label with a black and white line drawing of a spear, I assume the lance of Longinus. My fiance carried this back from Cali for me. Poured at 49° into a snifter. 1/8th inch head settles out instantly to a bubbly ring. The body of the beer is sorta a tawny port color, a reddish-orange in the deepest spots. Sweet oaky nose, some fruit, smells like a fruit forward red wine, not a lot of sour in the nose, maybe just a hint. The body is good, spritzy carbonation, lightly coating, lightly puckering. Flavor comes on strong with cherries, currants, very tart, a nice long rolling tartness, just a faint bit acetic, which I like in small quantities. Lots of oak, woody and dry, not vanilla, perhaps they used non-American barrels. As it's warmed slightly I'm picking up the brett in the nose, a kinda spicy chemical-leather. It's coming forward in the taste too, again, leathery and earthy melding into the sour fruits. The alcohol is really well hidden on this beast. It's an intense beverage to be sure, but well balanced, the tartness is just right, no real sign of the booze, goes down easily all things considered. I wish I had more of this stuff... 1,255 charactersOtesanek, Nov 22, 2009
4.05/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Big POP of the cork starts the fun with this RR classic. A thin & active light tan head forms then immediately vanishes. The beer is a ruby/amber color. Some rapidly rising carbonation can be seen along the edges of my tulip glass.
Aroma is tart, slight cherry. Oak makes an appearance as it continues open up.
Initial burst of tartness is followed by lots of cherry notes. A hint of vanilla and wood in the background. Only the slightest sense of warming from the ABV. There is an interesting lingering bitterness that remains and mixes with the wood notes. Very nice. Nutty notes now and again.
I obviously know this is brewed with currants, but I have no idea what currants taste like. I am thinking they are similar to cherry. I get this sense of pencil eraser in the flavor. I remember being a kid and sticking the end of the pencil in my mouth. Something here brought back that memory.. More wood is evident as it comes to room temp.
Carbonation is somewhat champagne like. Body is medium.light and the carbonation really brings the flavor to life.
This is a very nice beer and fairly complex. 1,103 charactersReagan1984, Nov 20, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I approached this beer with eager anticipation and confidence that it wouldn't disappoint. As expected it did not. Consecration pours a deep ruby red with almost blood orange hues and a healthy pink lacing. A depthful aroma forwarns of tartness but better yet contains a rich dark fruitiness and even...what is it,, Tamarind? Hints of vinegar and dried fruit follow. On the tongue the beer is obviously tart, subtly sour, and surprisingly chewy and full. Ever present is oak rounding out dried fruits lactic notes. At times lighter notes of raspberry almost shine through. A beery like vinegar flavor stings at the palate long after the sip is consumed. If one focuses in on the oak it opens up just slightly enough to reveal vanilla and coconut. Vinous. Though a lesser masterpiece than Temptation, Sanctification, Supplication, or Beatification in my opinion, this is a tour de force nonetheless. 898 charactersDaPeculierDane, Nov 12, 2009

T: The cherry flavor to me is the most predominant. The cherry flavor is slightly on the tart side. Good amounts of oak and currants as well.
M: Leaves a dry tartness on the palate, similar to red wine.

3.29/5  rDev -25.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.5Pours a deep crimson hued plum color with a very small bright purple head. Very little retention and chunky, slippery lacing. Amazing colored brew.
The smell is more vinous than anything. There is a strong concord grape driven smell up front with a fairly reserved funk. I'm liken this to a funky welches grape juice. I enjoy that the oak is not a dominating odor.
The flavor is loaded with grape, current and plums. There is a firm acidity reminiscent of white wine vinegar that covers up a lot of the underlying funk. The funkiness starts to emerge more as the puckering subsides. Once again there is a very vinous quality to this brew. There is no hint in the taste that Consecration sits at a hefty 10%.
The mouthfeel is very light and the carbonation ample and vibrant. There is a lactic thickness on the back end, but the acidity helps to cover and keep it light feeling.
Overall, I feel this brew lacks a complexity that I like in a wild. I enjoy this brew immensely, but this 750 is going to be a chore to polish off. 1,029 charactersBDLbrewster, Nov 09, 2009

A - Translucent chestnut, fizzy head, no retention or lacing.
S - Small amount of brown sugar, dry vinous, small notes of dark fruit, sour funk.
T - First glass full was overpowered by brett funk and tart. Not the expected lemon zest tart like a gueze, dry vinous tart from the carbarnet grapes. Taste failed to capture the complexity of the nose... until the second pour. Each sip brought different complexities, brown sugar and dark sweet fruits (date, fig). Palate ends with strong dose of oak.
M - Fizzy carbonation, good for this style, light bodied.
D - Delicious, complex wild ale, far exceeded my expectations. Yet, between the ABV and dry finish, finishing this big bottle was a bit laborious. 754 charactersstrictly4DK, Nov 07, 2009

Deep crimson in color with a head maintained by a continuous carbonation stream. Sour aroma with a mild mustiness.
Taste is almost perfectly balanced. Initial sourness melds into some wonderful fruit nuances. Just the right amount of sourness for my tastes. Tartness livens up the mouthfeel, while the beer remains very refreshing and non-cloying. Extremely drinkable at 10%. Well done sirs. Well done. 416 characterssinistermadman, Nov 01, 2009

A: Vinous purple with a head that quickly dissipates.
N: Dark fruit, and quite vinous. I'm starting to see a trend here. The oak aging, currants, and cabernet are all showing themselves. 
T: Deep fruit flavors, with a nice sour undercurrent running through it. Lot's of wine characteristics here. Dark red wine and tannins being tasted upon exhale. After swallowing, pleasant ripe fruit odors fill the mouth.
Overall, a very nice beer - one of the most compley I've tasted. Very full bodied, with sour flavors playing 2nd fiddle to the fruit and oak. I'd love to see some age on this beer, where hopefully some of the fruit will calm down a hair, allowing the brett/sour to show through. 720 charactersquinnsi, Oct 30, 2009

Batch 002 Bottling Run #2 
Poured into a New Belgium globe.
Appearance: Looked opaque at first, but closer observation showed that it was actually a beautiful mahogany color. When illuminated, the body glowed deep crimson and showed off the ferocious carbonation within. That carbonation fed a tight, creamy, khaki-colored head for the entire session; fantastic retention! This beer was also pretty clean; no real lacing to speak of.
Smell: Red wine vinegar, bread, tart red currants, and some other indescribable sourness. I'm sorry, but I really haven't had many sours - this was hard for me to put into words. Regardless, it was mouth-watering. And I'm not a sour guy either.
Taste: The first sip puckered me up bad, but after that I was able to acclimate. Fucking bomb! The cabernet character was bold, and the red currants accented it very nicely. Breadiness/malt formed a nice backbone, which helped balance out some of the tartness. Absolutely delicious. I'd give this a 5.0, but I think that may be a little premature. I'll definitely come back to it again in the future (after I've tasted a number of other sours).
Mouthfeel: Dry, sour, and highly carbonated. I heard from Brent that this particular batch was accidentally over-carbonated, but I feel like the high carbonation suited Consecration very nicely. Medium-bodied, slightly oily, and acidic.
Drinkability: I was really afraid that I wouldn't like this beer, but that wasn't the case at all. This was fantastic! I couldn't get enough! I'll definitely be buying Consecration again. Also, I liked it much better than Temptation (see review here: http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/9474/?ba=ThreeWiseMen). 1,834 charactersThreeWiseMen, Oct 20, 2009

A - Very brown, small head with quick dissipation and no lacing. Slightly red, can see through, nice minimal bubble streams add a classy look to this one.
S - Currants, sweet, can defiantely smell the alcohol, almost phenolish. Deep oak on the end.
T - Currants on the front, goes very tart and just doesn't quit. Very dry.
M - Medium light, no carbonation, very dry.
D - Too tart and too much phenol like taste to drink a lot of. In all fairness this might be a better beer than I'm going to end up rating, but it was following two sweeter beers that were both amazing (NG Raspberry Tart and RR Temptation). 631 charactersAgentZero, Oct 19, 2009

4.29/5  rDev -2.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I drank this from the bottle into a chalice. Batch 03.
This pours a light clear brown, very clear in the light. The head is very small with no retention, light lacing. 
The aroma is light but pretty complex, especially compared to temptation, which I tasted at the same time. The sour funk is there but there notes of sweet druit, alcohol and wood, which is very pleasant.
The taste is very strange and heavy handed in the beginning. Its like the tannins of a red wine. There are some notes of oak and alcohol. The taste is very sour on the end. **Upon re-review 8 months later, I like it a lot better. The wood really mellows out and starts to show off a little more sweetness in the red wine variety.
Mouthfeel is very heavy, but not entirely drinkable.
Overall, pretty damn good sour, but not world class as its rating and ranking suggest. Worth trying but don't overpay or trade for it. 895 charactersjrallen34, Oct 18, 2009

Smelled like currant jam and a little bit of balsamic vinegar had been smeared right on my upper lip, and I eagerly awaited licking it off. Poured like juice, slightly viscous, thin syrup, like from canned fruit. Little to no head. Tastes like (involuntary response) currants picked at the peak of perfection, crushed by the feet of nubile virgins. And I was licking their feet, gratefully, smacking my lips, licking my lips, leaving it in my mouth just to tease to see how long I could go without swallowing it. When it was finished, I was a little tipsy and begging for more. 657 charactersSechavar, Oct 15, 2009

The appearance in very dark and ruby. Almost like a pinot noir. It poured a little thick with almost no carbonation. There was little head that dissipated rather quickly.
The smell was very light in my opinion. Lots of sweet fruit with a little sour as well.
Taste was very good. It was sweet and sour and had almost taken on the pinot taste from the barrels that is aged on. It has some nice hops at the back of the palate.
Mouthfeel was very nice as well. It almost appears like wine but it had a lot of carbonation behind it. I was really not expecting the carbonation.
Drinkability is good but not great. If you like wild-ale this would be great. I could not keep drinking again and again especially with a $30 price tag. But you get what you pay for.
It was a great beer and I will drink again. 942 charactersslvrmon82, Oct 14, 2009

Amber pour with a nice little head coming off of it. Flavor was up front cranberry, plums, an plenty of tannic wine notes. Very tart, mildly refreshing. 
update on the batch 1/04
Starting to overcarbonate, champagne style large bubbles muddle up the complexity of this one. Touches of unwanted acidity are also coming forward, and the fruit has definitely died off a bit as well as the sharp tannic bite from the wine barrels. 512 characterspepsican, Oct 07, 2009

Sour and funky but not overpowering. Deep dark fruit flavors.

Batch 002X1 pours a hugely effervescent brown/chestnut with a rapidly falling tan head; a great beer to listen to...Nice viscosity to this, a touch of lacing & zero head retention
S: Much sourness, , leather, figs & candied cherries
T: Tartness, cherries, dryness; leather, raisins & figs up front, plus a touch of leafy hops. Oaky dryness & tart cherries dominate as this warms, & a bit of boozey figs, leather & more leafy hops as this warms. Finishes uber dry with leather. figs, vanilla & boozey cherries
MF: Medium bodied, soft carbonation, became oily & sticky once warm
Drinks easy as a wild ale & the ABV, a touch too dry for me to be completely happy with it, another great sour from these guys! 774 charactersrusspowell, Oct 06, 2009

Pours mahogany with a burnished ruby hue and a short head of beige that dissolved as quick as cola. A placid surface with zero lacework for the duration of the glass.
Aromatics lead off with acid-laced red wine, dark fruits, tannic skins, and vineous funk. Hints of wet sock on oak, cedar, spruce resin, cinnamon and the trademark juniper/quanine RR yeast. Earthy, tannic, fruity, and vineous.
Medium bodied with a quenching, puckering mouthfeel. Slick and crisp.
Cherries, Currants, grape must, robust wine, and vineous malt start the palate. A swift tartness steps forward as well as warming alcohol, lush fruit, pine bark, cedar dust, and oakey undertones.
Finishes with a lingering tartness, an extreme vineousity, and an incredible depth of flavor. 
What a great beer. Side by side vs. T20 I prefer this one. Much more depth of flavor and juicier. Not quite as funky and dry as the T20 though. I can only see this getting better with age also. Yikes. 1,004 charactersbrewandbbq, Oct 06, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5When I was in the Bay Area over Christmas last year, I drank about half a gallon of this delicious beer in the space of a week. While I've had it out of the bottle a couple of times since (batch 1), I haven't reviewed it , and this review is for a bottle from batch 2. Thank you, Scott.
In my RR -tion tulip, this beer is absolutely gorgeous. Brilliantly clear carmine with a large light brown head that recedes to a disk rather quickly. Truly beautiful
The nose is as beautiful as I remember it being. Deep and rich with balsamic vinegar, unsweetened chocolate, and fruit with currants and berries. Like an old estate library, the smell of leather is noticeable. In fact, this is like having a little pipe tobacco and having the aromas of a rich, red wine waft into your nostrils as you sit in that library. The wine character is beautifully expressed, with the tannins adding depth. The combination and sheer balance of the flavors is testament to Vinnie's genius
Opening up sour , quite intensely so with a combination of lemon and vinegar, it makes the palate pucker. Behind the initial wave of sourness is a strong vinous character, with the cabernet sauvignon (OK, red wine) carrying a blend of flavors with chocolate, berries and tobacco. The currants add some tartness and a bite to the mid palate. Mildly leathery and earthy before a long finish that's tart, mildly sweet and mildly tannic.
Deceptively light on the palate, this beer has a smooth, medium-light body with a fairly high level of carbonation. With a fantastic, complex finish, this beer is fabulous
While a little more acetic than I remember it being, this is still one immensely drinkable beer. The alcohol is exceptionally well-hidden, and I anticipate having no issues finishing this bottle.
**Edit 15 October 2010**
A little more than a year later, I'm revisiting this. While I've had it a couple of times since my review, I haven't taken notes since. Batch 1 again.
No real head or retention this time round, this beer is loud and fizzy. The nose seems to have faded a touch. While vinegary and vinous in a pleasing way, the fine balance seems to have been lost a little bit. Definitely oaky and woody, this isn't particularly funky, mostly just sour and again, with cocoa, leather and a little vanilla. The currants seem to be left as a sharp, fruity character here.
The palate opens moderately sour with a blend of vinegar and lactic acid with some lemon rind on the finish, this beer is pretty awesome. Beautiful mid-palate with cocoa, leather and oak, this beer is dry and moderately sour on the finish. The sourness is actually mostly fruity, almost making me think that it's from the currants, as it is neither overtly lemony, acetic or lactic, Vinous mid-palate, this beer really shines as it warms up. Initially too cold, it's starting to resemble what I remember it being, this is wonderfully structured. 4.5/4.5/4.5
**Edit 20 Aug 2011**
Batch 004x4, this is probably the third bottle I've had in about 9 months? The fruits are particularly noticeable on the nose, with a definite currant aroma. However, behind it, there's a rich, deep, complex nose, with earth and leather. Fruity, pulpy lemon pith with a pleasant oak character. Palate opens hugely sour with a prominent lime-like acidity with a touch of red wine vinegar. Mild booze, remarkably bright. Moderate currant flavor on the finish. Brown sugar, vanilla on the mid-palate. Nice structure and flavors here, Solid all-round 4.5/4/4
**Edit 21 April 2012**
Batch 005x2E, received from giant24. Thanks, Matt.
This batch appears to be a little more acetic and plenty more fruity than the other batches, making me think the barrels used for this blend were fresh and quite wet. This really does smell like a nice cab, fruity and leathery. A nice blend of lactic and lemony sourness here. Very nice. 4/4.5/4
**Edit 21 june 2013**
Batch 1 again. 
Despite my earlier misgivings, this is doing spectacularly well. Bright citrus and lactic acidity with gorgeous vinous notes, and a modest funk, this is excellent. The balance to tobacco, leather , both on the nose and palate is excellent. Juicy, okay vinous notes are present and the finish is excellently citrus, something I haven't wholly found in recent Russian River sours. Highly recommended. 4.5/4.5/4.5
**Edit 06 Apr 2014**
My last bottle of batch 2. Thank you, Scott. 
Such a joy. Preserved lemons, red wine, leather, fruity red wine and just plain fuxking delicious. Moderately tannic. A fucking masterpiece on the nose. The palate is similarly deep, complex and very well balanced. The lemony sourness is a characteristic that is diminishing in the newer Russian River sours, a change I'm not a huge fan of, but this vintage is a clean, crisp sour one with a nice blend of lactic and citric. Wonderful wine and fruity notes, very Much so. Awesome awesome stuff. 4.75/4.5/4.5 4,887 charactersDefenCorps, Oct 03, 2009
4.08/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A 750mL corked and caged bottle purchased from Matt at Capone's in Norristown. Poured into my Sam Adams perfect pint because, well, it was the only clean glass I had.
Appearance: A pop of the cork and a slow pour into my glass reveals a dark, ruby red colored brew. Very dark, almost black, but not quite as you could pick up the blood colored hues in the light. Only light I see coming through is around the outside of the glass. A tan/brown head develops, about a fingers worth, fizzy like soda or seltzer water, which relatively quickly recedes to a thin layer on top of the beer.
Smell: Funky. Fruity. I could pick up the currants that the bottle indicates are in there, as well as some oak sweetness. Maybe some other dark fruit aromas? Sweetness from the Cabernet Sauvignon/Oak barrels it was aged in comes through as well, it's probably the most predominant smell I pick up.
Taste: Very sour. Puckering, malicious sour flavor, but that's a good thing. This might be the most sour beer I've had. I get a touch of fruity sweetness before the sourness takes over. Once the sour subsides, it's a sweet oaky, red wine flavor, and this is where the currants come through. As the beer warms, the sourness dissipates slightly and the back end of the sip becomes a lot sweeter, and the currant and other fruit flavors become much more predominant.
Mouthfeel: Pretty light. Very fizzy on the tongue. Very puckering. In fact, after swallowing each sip, my mouth would still involuntarily pucker from the residual sourness. Pretty cool.
Drinkability: Wouldn't mind if this was in a 375mL or a 22oz'er. Delicious beer, but the more it warms the more I had to labor through it. Certainly a treat though.
This was my first RR Sour beer, and it has inspired me to seek out their others. 1,783 charactersEzekiel81923, Oct 01, 2009

A - A beautiful dark hazy brown color. Great carbonation due to the refermenting in the bottle(kind of like a shampagne). Poured well with a nice white head that lasted for awhile.
S - It had an amazing sweet fruity aroma(very vinous). 
T - The fruit smells come through in the taste. It's sweet, but not too sweet. And has some tartness on the backside.
M - Light, crisp, refreshing like a shampagne. Bubbly in your mouth.

wow. its carbonated like champagne, extremely sour and tart. the red wine is strongly present, and the fruitiness adds a sweetness that is very pleasant up front, though it resembles fruit candy, and is nearly as sugary (in fact, the aftertaste is reminiscent of sweet-tarts). acai berries and raisins come to mind. some slight alcohol notes through the middle, accompanied by an aged "woodiness" that, though subtle, is perhaps the best characteristic of the flavor. 
the mouthfeel is thin and light, as the bubbles explode fiercely all over the palate. its sticky and stays with you for a while. drinkability is no doubt limited to this 750ml bottle. i would prefer less, actually, but since its here ill drink it. 1,081 charactersjdklks, Sep 28, 2009

Batch 002x2
A- Pours a deep burgundy brown color with a massive off-white head that leaves a bit of lacing. The bubbles hiss as the head fades down to a nice half inch ring.
S- Lots of vinous and dark fruit aroma with a bit of funk and yeast scents. Plenty of oak and vanilla with red grapes.
T- Incredibly tart dark cherries and red grape initially. Black berries and currants with a vinegar-like sourness. Definetely some Brett funkiness flavor in there. Even if I had not known that this was aged in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, I would have been able to guess it easily. A splash of tobacco and oak with an unmistakable tannin dryness. This one takes a few sips to warm up to. The alcohol is almost non-existent and only leaves its mark with a bit of a warming effect that occurs just after half of the bottle is gone. 
M- Medium body with loads of carbonation. The bubbles glide across the tongue dispersing the flavor evenly throughout. Incredibly dry finish. 
D- Wow, this is one tremendously complex brew. This could easily bridge the gap between beer and red wine. A breed all of its own. 1,163 charactersprojectflam86, Sep 22, 2009

The color is a nice burgundy brown and the pour builds a nice foamy head that dissipates very quickly as it bubbles, pops and fizzes like the crown of a cola.
The smell is of currants, plums, fig newton insides, cabernet sauvignon and lemonheads.
Tastes of currants, ripe plum, leather and oak and a surprising hit of sparkling ocean spray sour cranberry. Cabernet is there with a nice tart lemony acetic backbone. Malt and hop is there if you look but this beer is wild and has much more complex flavors up front. A slight alcohol punch rounds out the finish.
Mouthfeel is pleasant, not heavy, not light. Very bubbly and dry. Very tarty as well and it leaves a sour finish in your mouth that is very welcome. In my book this beer offers the definition of a quality finish, which is one that lasts and lasts and lasts on your palate.
As I haven't gotten into Cabernet wines yet, this would be an ideal replacement to enjoy with a fine steak and potato dinner.

I think the weakest part of this brew is it's appearance. It pours an almost root beer brown and it's head leaves a bit to be desired. while it's plenty carbonated, the bubbles are a bit large, almost soapy in nature. as this one goes down, the lace left is a bit runny. It's still an attractive beer though, so the fact that this is it's weakest point really speaks to it's strength overall.
The nose is sweet and tart together. sour cherries poke their head out first and give way to a sweet and mild bubblegum.
This is a complex beer to say the least... flavors of those sour cherries come out right at the front, giving way to red grape tannins and then grapefruit. There's a real bite to it, both of the grapefruit and warhead variety... it really is wonderful and ends up sweetening substantially as it warms and the cabernet shines through.
overall, I'd say this is an extremely light, very drinkable beer... almost indescribably so considering it's heavy hitting ABV... you wouldn't know it was 10%. 1,115 charactersEliottJW, Sep 17, 2009

Smell is amazing. It has rich sugary notes and figs with this punch of acetic acid. Lemon and dark fruits as well. 
Starts with a little sugary sweetness then immediately moves into sour fruity flavors. Sour cherries and lemon come to mind. The finish is what I love about this beer, it's spicy, mineraly, crisp, and kind of reminds me of sweet tarts. 
Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, the sourness is not so insane that it ruins your palate. I can drink this all night long. What a treat. I still have not met a Russian River beer that hasn't amazed me. Highly recommended. 645 charactersbosco7, Sep 14, 2009

Appearance: Poured into a chalice, dark brown in color with some red overtones. Clarity is poor, small head that dissipates rapidly.
Aroma: Very prominent oak, getting lots of winelike character (from the cabernet barrels). Some burnt sugar character as well as dried fruits. Some horsey brett character also coming through.
Taste: Very acidic up front, like getting punched in the face. There is some complexity of flavor early on, but as you go through the glass, it just becomes more and more like drinking a carbonated cabernet sauvignon. 
Mouthfeel: More body than most sours. The wine-like character seems to create massive palate fatigue, coats the tongue
Drinkability: very poor, got through the glass, but could not make a session of this brew.

None of the banana characteristics are present in the taste, however. Sour, but not over the top, with very noticeable ketone/aldehyde characteristics. Hints of bourbon in the flavor and a bite to the tounge. Light mouthfeel. Surprisingly bitter finish. As a lambic, a nice balance between the sourness and malt.

Good carbonation and massive Beethoven's 5th notes of very ripe fruit and dark cherries. Lots of wine like qualities - more like Muscat-beer like qualities. Good amount of sourness and kinda like a blended cocktail of Muscat, sherry, Belgian dubbel, and a lambic. One of the few beers that is STRICLY an after-dinner thought.
For the novice: You probably won't like it.
Personally: Up front, I am not a fan of the oak barrel infused types of beer that tastes like wine or whiskeys. Consecration is in this category. Although, I can see drinking this over Temptation Blonde, that's not saying much. Not worth the price, I rather just buy a Flemish Sour. 743 charactersWCBCFrank, Aug 31, 2009

The Brett and other enzymes are interesting and adding to the palate message. Yet overall the taste is not that outstanding. Carbonation was above average, and this beverage did work with supper. An experience. Really good looking orangey off-white bubbly head, though a piece of black sediment rolled into the initial pour. Vinegar aroma which I am two minds about, one being the anticipation of a hard rocking palate cleanser, giving it the benefit of the doubt.
About a year later on tap at the brewpub. Just as good. 639 charactersSammy, Aug 30, 2009

Smells amazing, black cherries and funky oak. It's highly reminiscent of a great Gueuze I sampled in Belgium - perfectly aged. 
The taste is awesome. My girlfriend calls it a cross between sour gummy worms and red wine. I get what she means - there's a pleasant fruitiness, but it's not overly sour, more a tart sweetness, balanced with the minimal beer undertones. A wild that even the Belgians would drink proudly.
The slight bite on the mouthfeel is all that keeps this from a 5, there. It's well rounded with a puckering start that gives way to a mouthwateringly-sweet finish
I'd drink more if they weren't 20 each ;). This is a beer I cannot think of a food to pair with. It stands alone to be tasted, enjoyed on its own merits. 908 charactersTawnos, Aug 30, 2009
4.79/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Bring! I loved this one so much, I traded with him a second time to get my hands on more of this beer! 
Poured from a 750mL into a tulip. Gusher, very highly carbonated, incredibly foamy tarnished yellow coffee stained tooth head that is wildy active, at 2.5 fingers and comes to a standstill at a thin layer. Very dark and hazy muddy blood red. 
Cabernet soaked grapes and lemons, slight bit of oak. Red grapes are fantastic and really come straight out of the glass alongside some sweet cherry, gotta really get your nose in the glass to pick up some vanilla, a lot of red wine characteristics. 
Holy moly. The raspberry and tart black cherry is phenomenal, mouth puckering tartness, slight oak flavors but nothing too dry, brett comes out towards the end that blows my mind out of my skull. Really overcarbonated and tons of matured and aged red grapes are all of the place. Lemon sourness is superb. 
Very full bodied, yet not over the top thickness works well with the high level of bubbles in this guy. Another awesome RR. 1,047 charactersCoolJosh, Aug 28, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks goes out to ipa247 for this one. Hell of a fine trader.
batch #1. 750ml. Cork, cage, etc.
Cork pops out with a huge dupontesque BOOF! Pours a nice clear red ruby brownish color with a nice fizzy light tan head that actually retains well, by style standards. After a couple minutes it reduces to only a skim over the surface with a pretty good size ring around the edges of the glass. Leaves little lacing, but a good amount for the style.
Nose has subtle black currant and a lot of flemishy lacto tartness and funk. Oak is also apparent in the nose as is a cherry type of sweetness, likely from the currants.
Hmmm. Not as wildly sour as I was expecting, thats for sure, but certainly a tart beer. Really this is like a beefed up flemish ale, without heavy vinegar as is often found, although it is there. The currants are actually pretty noticeable in the flavor, as the sourness is not overbearing or terribly palate raping. The finish is brutally dry, but the sweetness of the added fruit does balance it out. This really is seemingly a nice cross between flemish styles and real american wild ale. Excellent balance. The oak does definitely make its presence known, especially right before the finish as well as in the aftertaste. Aftertaste lingers with slight vinegar, currant, and lacto mouth pucker.
Mouthfeel is right where it oughta be. Hard to argue any point of this really. There could be a tiny touch more carbonation, that is really my only qualm.
Drinkability is simply outstanding, both for the style and for the abv. It could be improved upon, but not a hell of alot.
Overall a fine beer, and a really interesting (at least IMO) melding of styles. I like the flemish lick that the addition of currants and barrel aging provide, and the fact that it doesn't get too flemish on us and forgoes having too much vinegar barf flavor. An impressive and incredibly complex and educational beverage. One i will be sure to cellar, and enjoy again in the future. Excited to see how this batch 2 is...Great beer. 2,035 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Aug 28, 2009
3.61/5  rDev -18.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks again to treyrab and cooljosh for breaking this out at the tasting on night number two of the beer extravaganza weekend. This one was from Batch 2.
A: Deep clear and crisp ruby color, very dark. Thin small wisps of bubbles move upwards for a long time, popping as soon as they hit the surface, leaving no sign that they were ever there.
S: Sour and funky, but to my utmost disappointment, I can't make out a single note, no matter how subtle, of the red wine or the currants. Chocolatey in the in the background, but I can't get past the lack of fruits, dark or otherwise, in the flavor.
T: The taste starts off as tart which then gives in to a bitter dark chocolate character. The two flavor sensations seem to clash a bit, the sour and the bitter just don't jive to well on my pallet. Currants finally manifest themselves in the aftertaste, but it seems like too little too late. There is also a touch of alcohol warmth in the finish.
M/D: Highly carbonated, this beer tickles the tongue and presents a medium thicker texture than the lighter colored wilds. The alcohol can be felt somewhat, but the sourness is very good. I just wish there wasn't that chocolatey bitterness...it seems to take away from the funky sourness of the yeast strain. The beer is a bit too heavy for my wild taste, too.
BATCH 1: 10/2/10
4.5/4/4.5/4.5/4.5
Deep brown highlighted by mahogany and garnet. Creamy and foamy head with great retention. Lacing is impressive and full.
Very potent aroma of signature RR funk, a balanced pedio sourness, and a base of currants and dark fruits. On the palate, the funk is more pronounced, and the currants really shine. Hints of bitter dark chocolate also come through. This was much better than the mess of Batch1 that I tasted from the keg about a month ago.
Sourness puckers the tongue initially, but otherwise, it is smooth and silky, leaving a syrupy funky taste on the palate. Probably the best batch of Consecration that I have had. 1,970 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Aug 27, 2009
4.24/5  rDev -3.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at RR in Santa Rosa. Poured in a short glass to a cloudy brownish-ornage with medium thick off-white head that lingers well and leaves okay lacing. Nose is sour red fruit and hops, mouthfeel thick and tangy-sweet and the taste a perrfect follow to the scents in the nose, with some alcohol added in at mid-glass. Like a good Flemish Sour, the finish was long and a rush of tangy fruit, quickly followed by a warming sugar sweetness.
Not quite the Duchesse, but a damn good Sour. 486 characterskimcgolf, Aug 23, 2009

4.08/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Belmont Station and Bailey's Taproom in Portland. Pours a hazy ruby/plum with a small head. Aroma is red wine, cherries, and oak. The taste is more of the same but with a strong sourness that reminds me at times of some of my favorite sour candies. But it isn't that simple since the barrel creates a nice complexity and keeps me going back for more. I'm not a sour beer expert but I really liked this. 412 characterssquaremile, Aug 21, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5liter bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. pours a chestnut brown color with one finger of loose eggshell colored head. poor retention and no lacings.
aroma is mildly sour with dark fruits and notes of cherry, passionfruit and currants. the sour note is mildly vinous with a bit of funk mixed in. the fruit is subtle, but mixes in nicely with the overall profile. the sour character gets more pronounced as the beer warms.
taste is of a vinegar-like sourness with fruit close behind. raspberries, cherries, passionfruit and currants are all present. no alcohol shows, which is good for 10% APV. the brew is lightly effervescent, and just sour enough to sustain the fruit character.
mouthfeel is medium bodied and mildly tart in texture. the brew finishes on a tart ntote with residual berries and currants. nicely proportioned on the palate. the sourness is just strong enough to keep the palate honest.
drinkability is excellent. prefectly proportioned on the palate with a wonderful fruit bouquet and mildly vinous finish that works magic on the palate. this beer is phenomenal. it dances on the palate with a sour character that enhances the drinkability. cheers! 1,177 charactersbotham, Aug 20, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750 ml bottle, 10% ABV. Pours a very cloudy dark brown color, leaning towards mahogany. Tan, wispy head disappears after a minute, leaving no lace.
Sour cherry in the nose at first, a bit leathery, followed by some blackberry. Aroma is quite complex, and melds together very well. No heat from the alcohol noticed here.
Very tart up front, nearly puckering. Some berry flavors, and a good amount of earthy tones. Again, a bit leathery, and funky. Long lingering earthy finish.
Light body, and carbonation. Good amount of acidity. Some alcohol warmth, but not as much as you would expect for a beer of this size. Very complex, and delicious. 643 charactersBierguy5, Aug 19, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Dark amber colour with large bubbles at first that could have easily fooled me for being a Belgian import. Nose has a pleasant sour cherry component, with light vinegar, and fig newton snacks. Just as I'm starting to enjoy it the brett funk kicks in and the fair reviewer side of me reminds me that barnyard is supposed to be good here. The sourness dominates on the palate, with cherry taking some background to the fig newtons and vinegar. Finish is long and vinegary, and really smacks you in the face with the flavors. Even if you like the style it is still hardly something that anyone should describe as having high drinkability. 635 charactersyemenmocha, Aug 19, 2009

A- Dark brown with red highlights. Big, whispy carbonated head that dicipates quickly. Little to no lacing.
S- Red wine, oak, tobacco. Slight red wine vinegar acidity note. Slight dark fruit note as well. Amazing.
T- Amazingly complex belnd of sour yet subtle fruit, red wine and oak, hints of vanilla. Nice earthy notes. Slight acidity on the back end. Finishes with a nice red wine taste. Perfect.
M- Medium bodied, perfect carbonation level from the yeast. Excellent smooth, silky wine like finish and aftertaste.
D- Wow, if i was never allowed to drink red wine again and wanted to still experience many of the positives, i would reach for this. The ultimate American Wild Ale experience. 780 charactersrfgetz, Aug 17, 2009
3.53/5  rDev -20%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Thanks for the trade Christian
Pours a very dark shade of brown, looks black in low light. A solid two fingers of very lively head rises up but falls quickly, leaving a thick persistent collar around my 25 oz. snifter. Smell is very mild funkiness, tart apples, caramel, grapes, a hint of oak barrel as well. 
Taste is a mouth puckering mash of grapes, apple skin, strong oak presence, vinegar, caramel, and dirt. Very complex but the oak comes through a tad too much leaving a dryness on the palate that I don't care for. Medium bodied and like I said very dry. This is a very impressive beer but not really my cup of tea quite yet (still so/so about sours).
I will revisit this again next year and see if my opinion has changed. 733 charactersalcstradamus, Aug 17, 2009

Pop open the bottle and notice the scent of cherries. A very good smell. Poured a dark red color into a glass. Slight head on top with lots of tiny bubbles bursting on top. A very nice sour taste on the first sip. Not overwhelming with a nice sour back end. 
I been hearing how good this beer is and I'm glad I tried it. Also glad the price I paid for wasn't wasted (It's a wee bit up there). Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice sour taste. The carbonation is caused by the refermenting in the bottle and it definitely shows in the glass and the way it pops in your mouth. I could drink another one easily but I'm gonna have to break my piggy bank for that. Wow, look at the fizz of that second pour and the smell. This is good! 793 charactersWestsidebuddha, Aug 16, 2009
4.02/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3I bought this dousy at the Hulmeville Inn in PA. Poured a very deep ruby red with a brown touch.Kind of hazy thick light brown heading that looks like coca cola coming in fizzy and leaving flat.A constant flow of bubbles form in my tulip that come from the bottom and raise to the surface of the glass like a fountain.
Smell is very tart at first but are taken over by fine sour wine with and old wood barrel kick.
Taste is ridiculously sour that makes my face squishy like I ate a dozen sour warheads(love those thing's) at once. A kind of gritty souriness gets up in the gums and tickles the teeth.
Mouth again ridiculously sour that sticks to the palate and does let go for the rest of the tasting. Fuller then full bodied,amazing carbonation. If this were flat this would be an amzing wine (Don't know if that's a good thing.)
Drink is mostly a sipper and a taster. I really couldn't see anyone having a session with this beer it is way too sour but definetly a good drink to try.
I would like to thank alot of the people on BA who pretty much told me it was a good deal to get this. Otherwise I might have forgotten about it. Thankyou. 1,145 charactersTheFightfan1, Aug 15, 2009
3.95/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Enormous thanks to msubulldog25 for his generosity on this one. This was basically a gift, in that I didn't trade for it, and he simply offered it. Wotta guy.
Poured a fluffy, audibly crackly head. Color borders on black, but is more of a very, very dark brown.
Aroma is mostly wood and extremely young grapes. Has a generally vinous, weedy, unripe and exotic smell. You know you're in for something unique just by smelling it.
Flavor is exceedingly vinous and acidic. Lots of young dark fruit, mostly berry. Wood is present but subtle and supportive only. Tartness in both flavor and feel (makes the mouth pucker). Quite dry and spritzy, like champagne. Lightly pasty like an intense red wine, but that could just be the tartness talking. The feel is something to get used to, but if reviewing to style, it's wonderful.
I have to be in the mood for this sort of beer (which has a lot in common with an Oud Bruin), and it's generally not the sort of thing I'd reach for if given many other choices, but the quality and character is clearly on a high level. Very glad to have tried it. 1,088 charactersMetalmonk, Aug 15, 2009

4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Honestly it looks like cheap american Cabernet Sauvignon slightly oxidized. Bricking maroon with some purple hints. Really nice looking with a spritzy brown head that faded into nothing nearly instantly.
Black currant, black cherry, black raspberry galore, hints of tart funky brettanomyces. Wood shows well. Slight bit of oxidation, leather, barn yard.
Just a fabulous outrageously tart acidic wild ale. Black fruit dominates obviously driven by the black currant with full bodied berry, tart cherry, black raspberry and plum. Thickly tart with brett and a bit tannic from the oak. Mouthfeel is a blast of spritzy carbonation and acidity. Brett shows well throughout and keeps things fresh. Wish I could afford more of these. 728 charactersmcallister, Aug 12, 2009

S- Delicious dark fruit, the currants are really noticeable. Tartness for sure. Grape as well, a definite wine smell.
T- Quite sour and lots of fruit at the beginning. Really delicious on the finish: the cabernet and brett meld to form a wonderful buttery tart taste.
M- Excellent soft mouthfeel with spritzy carbonation.
D- Drinkability is inhibited by the intensity of the acidity, which is really accentuated by the tartness of the currants. Of course its delicious, although not my favorite RR beer, but difficult to drink a whole bottle in one sitting. 635 charactersFreightTrain, Aug 11, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750ml single from Wilbur's in Ft. Collins, around $23. Batch #002X2. 
A: Dark purple, plum colored, with a cream fading towards pink head, about half an inch on the first pour, bubbles are loosely forming, looks more like soap bubbles than beer. Pretty fiar head retention. Fairly cloudy, and pretty sticky lacing. Nice looking beer. Not to mention loud! Holy hell the bubbles are loud in this one. 
S: Sour barnyard stanky funk, horse blanket, and a little bit like feet, slight woodyness from the barrel aging and also quite fruity, definitely can tell there are currents in this beer. Smells quite tasty. 
T: SOUR! Wow, lots of sour funk, quite medicinal, has a fairly pronounced hop biterness as well. Currants are strong and make this even more intensely sour. A few little woody hints come out here and there, but they can't even begin to compare with the sourness and fruitiness of the beer. Slight boozy hint, but falls in the mix nicely with the rest of the beer. The sourness really lingers in my mouth on this one, definitely a lactic acid sourness. Quite acidic, and quite delicious, I'm not disappointed at all! 
M: Puckering sour, extremely dry, and hugely acidic in the mouth, makes my saliva really really thick. Did I mention this beer is dry, wow! Also a slight bit of alcohol heat in here. Excellent. 
D: One of the easiest drinking sours I've ever had, this is impressive. My girlfriend was not impressed, so I won't have any difficulty drinking here share of the bottle. Excellent beer, and now I understand why the RR sours are so sought after. I can only imagine what the others taste like. Exceptional!

Body is a deep brown mahogany tone in color, really romantic. Nose is lovely with up front raspberries, so lush and slightly tart. Rich dark fruit tones come through with some oak and even a hint of sweet bourbon. With first sip you get some vanilla and oak then quickly comes the tannin based dark fruit sour feel that really embraces the tongue completely. Raisins, figs, blackberries and citrus rind all mark a wonderful tart fruit profile. The bold almost rich tannin feel really rounds out the taste perfectly. Superb balance and complexity make this beer a real standout. Mouthfeel is very red wine like, really making you want the next sip. Off the chart drinkability for a beer in this category. 804 charactersSPLITGRIN, Aug 07, 2009

Appearance: Much, much more carbonated than the Cuvee de Tomme, with a lot of bubbles and a nice solid pop when opened. Heavy tiny bubbles lace and bubble much like a soda, and looks kind of coke-esque. Laces very nicely and eventually mellows out to a golden brown hue. Very pleasing. 
Smell: It's a like a red-wine beer which hey, it kind of is. The CabSauv smell is definitely apparent, as are the slight hops and the raisin / current esters. Slight tobacco-y spice to it as well, with just a hint of oak. Opens up nicely and very, very pleasant.
Taste: Not as sour as I (or my puckering palate) was expecting, but definitely tart and sweet. Currant and red wine are upfront, with a sweeter hint of grape-y, soda-y taste on the back-end. Really very nice, and while not incredibly complex, the flavors are consistently excellent.
Mouthfeel: Heavily carbonated and very, very dry. Finishes like a champagne, with bubbly texture and brut finish. Tartness lingers slightly, but overall not too syrupy and if anything, almost too carbonated (which, after having disappointingly flat brews, is a good problem to have if you have to pick which side to fall on).
Drinkability: For a 10%, it's excellent. Could drink it all night. Definitely warms you up quickly however, and would be tough to drink the whole thing on my lonesome ABV wise eventually. Thoroughly enjoyable, and Wild Ales are quickly becoming my new favorite style. While expensive, it's certainly worthy and fantastic, and more than just an enjoyable brew but an excellent one. 1,702 charactersnomomentwasted, Aug 02, 2009

A - Pours a deep ruby, brown color. I slightly thin, bordering on soda-like. A steady and vibrant stream of never-ending bubbles rises and keeps a constant head in the glass.
S - Tart sourness, some fruitiness from the currants. Very nice, but not as complex as I expected. Just finished sampling an Ithaca Brute, and not getting as much aroma from this one. Maybe the Brute was just so good...
T - Tart, sour, fruity...somewhat grape and red wine-like in flavor. Sour, but not overwhelminglhy sour. Pretty smooth. Elements of raisins, sour cherries there too.
M - Light bodied, lots of carbonation. Very nice.
D - Quite nice...and very drinkable. Going well with pizza. Definitely could have more of this...very good. 840 charactersportia99, Aug 02, 2009

A: An iced tea brown with a golden sugary tone in there. Head forms quickly, but breaks down fairly quickly. It continues to bubble up and create new life that almost spontaneously breaks down again.. intriguing.
S: Rich malts, plenty of funky aromas, and a beautiful oakiness. All the scents blend together almost magically. This is amazingly pleasant. The currants are not really noted, unless I give it a swirl, and still they are quite modest. 
T: Tart and woody, with a mix of yeast flavours all over the place... funky, peppery - a nice, warm alcohol. 
M + D: Starts quite carbonated - though this calms the more I swirl it, naturally. The flavours hold on for quite a while, and the warming on the way down makes for a pleasant sipper. A great beer, with plenty of complexity to keep the nose and palate busy. 940 charactersProteus93, Aug 01, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 001x4
Deep ruby in color, with a brownish tint. Slightly hazy. The carbonation looks pretty lively, keeping the frothy tan foam at more than just a ring. Tart vinegar aroma, with cherry fruit, much like like an Oud Bruin really. Nothing too funky, just straight forward sour brown smell. 
I wouldn't call the taste sour as much as just very tangy. It hits you with cherry and vinous fruit character up front, and those flavors linger strongly. Not until the beer warms a bit do you actually detect some sweetness of malt with some raisiny caramel notes. The finish has a bit of astringence, but not too much alcohol heat to detract. The wood presence seems more in the background unfortunately, perhaps some more time in the barrel would have helped that. 
I was glad to see in the appearance that the carbonation looked intense. However, I would say it came off as a little too much at first, quite sharp on the tongue, although it settles down after sitting a few minutes in the glass. Light to medium thick body.
When you let this beer warm a bit, and allow the carbonation to settle down, it turns out to be pretty good in terms of drinkability. I wasn't as amazed as I expected to be considering the hype, but I did like it. I'm not sure it is worth the price tag, but I would be interested in trying different batches to see any differences... 1,359 charactersbennetj17, Jul 31, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from Batch 001x4 at Naja's in Redondo Beach, CA.
Pours a clear dark ruby/brown color with a half-finger tan head. The head dissipates into a thin layer on top leaving light lacing.
Smells of tart cherries and currants - though I'll be the first to admit the latter is noticed primarily from reading the bottle - with a solid funkiness and hints of oak. As it warms the oak flavors gain some steam but the tart fruit never wavers.
Tastes similar to how it smells. Mildly sweet light to medium fruit flavors up front are overtaken quickly by tart fruit flavors that become more tart as the beer warms. There's a hint of raisins and other dark fruit in the taste that wasn't present in the aroma. Ending is solidly tart and mildly dry.
Mouthfeel is great. This is one of the best I can remember from an AWA, a very nice thickness with active and grainy carbonation.
Drinkability is very good. I finished the bottle surprisingly quick and could easily have had another.
Overall this was a very good AWA and my first foray into RR sours. A good way to start. 1,066 charactersglid02, Jul 30, 2009

Appearance - Darker than expected. Brown. Fairly clear. It's almost a nice ruby when held up to the light. Lots of toffee colored head dissipates pretty quickly.
Smell - You can definitely smell those currants. Almost a hint of raisin. Oh, did I say stinky wet horse blanket? I meant to. Because there's a lot of it. A musty barn. Lots of subtle flavors I'm struggling to place. 
Taste - Wow. Just a ton going on. Mouth puckering sour. Those currants are in effect. Some real vinegar action, but in a nice way. Ripe berries. There is a subtle wine thing going on. Sour cherries for sure. Some grape, and you can definitely taste the oak. Very sweet, and tart as hell. It's like sweet tart beer (this is a good thing). Chocolate at the end?
Mouthfeel - Tons of prickly carbonation. Nice and crisp. I really like it. 
Drinkability - Very good. A little tricky because of all the sour and craziness. 
This is a hell of an interesting thing. The lady friend was startled. She had no idea beer could taste like this. I am really enjoying it. Just a funky, weird, crazy thing going on. 1,211 characterscallmescraps, Jul 29, 2009

Opens with a nice big pop. Batch 002X1
Pours only a thin layer of tan head. Decent retention. Color is a dark dark cherry-hued brown. It is a clear bee but you can't see all the way through it. 
Aroma: I can smell the wine from the barrels that it was aged in. A nice wood/oak smell. Grapes. I am guessing this is the currants, which I am liking. A very complex flavor. A nice sour/wild smell if that makes sense. Makes the mouth water. 
Taste: Very sour and amazing. I am digging the currants. A lot of fresh ripe berries. Nice barrel-aged taste going on her. It is very tart. Has some grapes here as well. Damn, this tastes good. Stunning. Next up is the tart cherries with a little bready malts to balance out things. I am very impressed. 
Mouthfeel: Sour, tart, and puckering. I love it. Medium bodied with a perfect level or carbonation. This beer is just flowing right now. Leaves a nice tart aftertaste. Damn RR did an amazing job here. Very clean.
Overall, this is an amazing beer. I am trying not to drink this treat fast, but it that isn't happening very well. Very drinkable and I want more. One of my favorite beers I have had yet! 1,189 charactersmothman, Jul 27, 2009
4.29/5  rDev -2.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5On tap at the Toronado in a tiny little glass (6 oz?). I love sours and having missed Stone's Sour Fest, I had to try this.
Dark maroon -- light barely broke through, revealing some rubies in there. No head, but that could be the pour (again, tiny glass) as there was fine carbonation.
MMM.. vinous, vinegar, currant (or is that association from the description on the tap?), oak for sure. Sour cherries? Funky in the nose. Yet I was a little disappointed with the flavor -- felt it was over-dominated by the oak so the sour fruit flavors didn't have enough room to be fully appreciated.
A little fizzy, but i like how the tartness puckers and dries you up. Goes down way too easy for 10%. Maybe the batch I got was over-oaked. Would definitely love to split a 750mL of this sometime... 789 charactersjbsteiny, Jul 24, 2009
4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Split a bottle with abfraser last night at Cheeky Monk in Denver. (by the way, great price for a bar - $26). This is my third time drinking Consecration now and I love it. Dark brown with a red tinge, I assume from the currants it's brewed with. Plenty 'o head. Crisp, tart smell. A very dry beer (though not as dry as I remember batch 1 being, but maybe I just forgot), tart, but not crazy sour like an Isabelle Proximus or Beatification. Nor is there a great deal of funk. Plenty of fruit flavors as well. So this is a very refreshing beer and was perfect for a hot summer night sitting out on the sidewalk. I'm grateful that RR is now distributed in Colorado. 662 characterswaltonc, Jul 24, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5So I had batch 1 and 2 side by side.(I know, I am a jerk) 1x3 and 2x1
Here is my conglamerate review.
Appearance is very similar between the two, dark black cherry color with small head and some lacing.
Smell was very distinct- batch 1 had a deep dark fruit nose- currant and fig... whereas batch 2 was very similar to a Cabernet Saugvinon wine- drier, tobaccoy, with some grapes and prunes.
Taste was out of this world, more of the same but just full flavor and perfectly balanced.
Mouthfeel was very good, thick but nicely carbonated.
Drinkability was great. 560 characterssupercolter, Jul 24, 2009

Batch 001 x 4
A: Pours a dark brown/rusty red color with a smallish, off-white head that leaves no lace behind. Carbonation is pretty active.
S: Aromas of sour grapes, oak, and some dark fruit. Heather felt it smelled very "winey". Incredible is how it smelled!
T: Tangy grape, sodden oak, carmelized brown sugar, and a boatload of both sweet and tart dark fruit. More complex wine flavors.
M: Tart and quite tangy. Really puckery at first, but becomes sweeter and mellower as it warms. Exquisite balance.
D: Virtually invisible alcohol content. Characteristically awesome. Thanks Joe! 770 charactersGbVDave, Jul 23, 2009

Batch #2. Pours thick, dark, cloudy red with a bubbly head that falls instantly to the barest of rings. Smells is all sour, funky cherry (or is that currants?). 
Taste is like a sour slap upside the head. The sour funk runs up into my nasal passages & clears up the mild cold that started, as well as aiding my arthritis & cataracts. Yeesh! Sour dark fruits, funk, with a dry, tart finish contributed by the wood that sears the top of my mouth & back of my throat.
I think dry & tart covers the mouthfeel, with high carbonation. I can hear it bubbling. Drinkability is high/low. Low because I couldn't have more than half the bomber, high because it's unique & soothing on the tongue. As I move on even a half-bomber is a lot; eight ounces would have sufficed. 
Very good beer. Can't say that I'm as enamored of it as the general BA population, but I understand the appeal. A wonderful once-in-a-while treat. 1,044 charactersmaximum12, Jul 22, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Very dark, deep burgundy hue in glass. Has a sweet fruitiness of raspberries and currants balanced by sour tartness. Consecration is aged in wine barrels and there is definitely a hint of red wine in the aftertaste. Although it's sour, it's so delicious I found myself almost gulping it down. 
What makes this beer work so well is the balance between dark/sweet flavors, and bright/sour flavors. The dark/sweet flavors coming from the fact that the baseline beer for this brew is a Belgian style dark ale with currants added, that has been aged in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels. 
The yeast used, Bretanomyces, also adds some earthy flavors to the mix. This is then counterbalanced by the bright sourness produced by the bacterias: Lactobacilius and Pediococcus. FWIW, that kind of sourness I can only relate to candy like sour patch kids, but the sourness has a lot of flavors competing for attention. This brew has some real complexity and depth of flavor. Highly recommended. 974 characterswd40, Jul 19, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The appearance was definitely intriguing. Poured a foamy tan head that quickly dissipated. The color was amazing, an almost plum purple.
Smell was acidic yet sweet, berries and red wine break through the vinegar. No hops, but who needs 'em when you got brett?
Taste and mouthfeel were no doubt puckering, but this was an extremely well balanced ale. Beautiful red wine and berry notes are perfectly complemented by the acidity. No alcohol present whatsoever. An expertly done ale. I have to say this beer makes me reconsider my previous ratings. 
This beer is complex and intriguing, I could probably finish off a bottle of this by my self, but maybe not much more.
Loved it... 681 charactersLlewellyn9, Jul 16, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On-Tap @ Belmont Station poured into Tulip glass.
Pours a rich plum color with some glowing red hues and a light, fluffy tan colored head that quickly burns out into a nice thin wispy ring around the glass. The aroma is filled with tart berries, touches of oak and just a plain overall sour aroma. The flavor is very much the same with tart berries being the first thing you taste and eventually allows for some oak and touches of earthy hops to shine through and finishes very dry. Its a very effervescent beer and is light bodied. This is quite a tasty beer. It has very nice sourness which doesn't blast you away but definitely makes you pucker. The alcohol is very well hidden and will sneak up on you if you aren't careful as this is an easy drinker. Lovely, delicious stuff. 781 charactersDiabolikDUB, Jul 15, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Got in a trade with mjl21...thanks for everything like usual Mike!
A- Pours a darker brown color with red highlights to it when held up to the light. Had a nice two finger head that went away rather quickly leaving little lacing on the sides that slide down the glass.
S- This has a very wine vinegar smell to it. I like it a lot from first smell. Cherry and maybe a touch of apple keep popping up with hints of oak from time to time. This is a damn fine smelling beer. The currants in it bring up the backbone of this beer for sure.
T- Wow....this is what I've been waiting for?? Well worth it! Sour upfront with currants and cherries blasting through. The middle has a oaky and slight apple tinge to it with the ending being a vinegary sourness to it that comes through more at the end then at the front of the beer. I can't get enough of this taste...so good!
M- This is a medium-light mouthfeel I think. The carbonation is lacking a little but still amazing to say the least. It rest in your mouth but the sourness to it pushes it through to the back of your throat. Aftertaste is like a wine (merlot or cab. sauv).
D- I am always down for a wild ale but the guys I spilt it with were not fans of wild ales and wanted me to crack open another one....if only I had another I would have. Good job Russian River and great job Mike for getting this wonderful beer to me! 1,375 charactersalleykatking, Jul 15, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had this on tap at the Toronodo, served in a tulip glass. This thing is wild. 
The appearance was a darker brown with a lighter consistency. It was thinner than I would have expected. It also came with a dark dark purple tint, and no head. It left no lacing and left a light alcoholic residue on the glass promising it was 10% ABV. 
The smell was interesting. It smelled of dark bitter fruits. It had a light hop bitterness also but overall this thing had a fermented wine smell. I also got heavy acidic smells as well as cherry?
The taste was something different. It was like a sweet wine, with dark pomegranate. Had the craziest mouthfeel. It was a bit overly carbonated and fruity. The alcoholic taste was covered well, but I can also take the booziness in good stride. My palate does not pick that aspect up as much as others. The fruit was intense. It was not even like drinking a beer, it was like a wine-fruit-coca cola- brew extravaganza. The most overwhelming characteristic was the bitter fruit and carbonation. 
The drinkability was good, but I would of not drank a whole bottle of this. It is boozy and when you stand up after a full glass you can tell. I think it was an interesting brew that I would love to revisit sometime down the road, but not an everyday repeat.

4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally cracked into my batch #2 bottle... sat in 9 deg. C for a little over a month, popped in the freezer for about 30 min., opened, and let it sit for over an hour to warm up. Poured into a tumbler..
- Looks like a glass of coke without ice. Bubbles like a cider... quick head to quick no head! Sparkling like a wine.. cola colored, clear...
- Bright currants hit the nose with a slight vinegar scent.. little bit of pickled olive.. slight alcohol... sweet cola.. grape.. fig.. spice.. hint of oak character.. sparkling vineyard. 
- Crystal clear waters with tart cherry but more so black currants and blueberry... very tart... only a slight bit of acid and vinegar.. with a very complex barrel oakiness to it... little bit of grape...
- Light on the tongue, leaves only a slight bit of tartness, or early picked sweet currants.. blackberry, grape sitting on the tonque... not even very dry..
- Quite drinkable.. but fizzes up a lot on the tongue.. I guess the way it's produced.. like a sparkling wine.. will do that, and is normal... but this is a sipper! Very drinkable, and as I am not a huge fan of the style, I am further understanding it... and I must say, with this one I am truly floored at how well put together and complex it is. A great sour wild ale from Russian River. 1,290 charactersDocer, Jul 07, 2009

S: The nose is sour in general, but specifically sour cherries. The oak barrel also really comes through.
T: Again, lots of sour cherries. Quite tart. Maybe also some grapes and you definitely get the currants. The combination of the Brett, barrel, and fruit give the beer a very dry and tannic character..
M: The body is rather full with a high level of carbonation and a very dry finish.
D: Incredible. You would never know the ABV strength of this beer as the alcohol is completely covered by the wonderful taste. 579 characterswomencantsail, Jul 06, 2009

served in a tulip glass...reddish/brown body...not much of a head on this one...no signs of lace at all
sour/tart cherries...biscuity yeast...some Belgian candy sweetness
sour cherries/green apples was all i could think of after each sip....really could feel it in my cheeks
despite the sour/tart flavors this was very smooth to drink...nice medium bodied...dry finish...not overly carbonated
this style is way out there for me...like i stated earlier this is my first time trying an American Wild Ale...took me a while to drink it, but made my way through it with no problems...taking a few sips of ice water between sips of beer made it a bit more bearable...i'm always willing to try anything from Russian River so I couldn't pass this one up....would I go back to it again if I found it, probably not but that doesn't mean it's a bad beer in my eyes...when i become more familiar with this style i may have it again and re-review it 1,054 charactersSPRichard, Jul 05, 2009

The beer is hazy, dark reddish brown with a 1-finger off-white foam that quickly dissipated to a thin ring around the glass. Much darker than I initially expected. The aroma is sour and acidic with a strong raisin character. There's much more dark fruit than I normally get in a wild ale, I think I smell plums and a touch of alcohol also. I like everything about the aroma except the alcohol, maybe it can't be helped due to the high ABV. The taste is not as sour as feared or hoped, but crisply tart. Lots of raisins, plums, some sweet and tart cherries, very very good. More in-your-face than Belgian wild ales, this has more evident alcohol and bolder flavors overall. Medium body but the rich flavors and threat of 10% tempers the drinkability a bit. 834 charactersTurdFurgison, Jul 02, 2009

S- Earthy and woody aroma with hints of cedar and oak. Nice big tartness in the aroma as well.
T- Strawberries, cherries, some oak, grassy bitterness and large tartness that I have come to expect form American Wilds. Also some really nice sweetness, caramel and vanilla. Very tasty beer.
M- medium bodied beer with waves of sweet oiliness balanced by dry bitterness and puckering sour. 
So far this is one of my favorite wild ales, it is very sour but yet still has nice sweetness and great complexity. I can't wait to try more wilds from Russian River! 650 charactersbr3wmeister, Jul 02, 2009

served in orval chalice
dark ruby red w brown tint. creamy, tan, faintly pink head. fades to creamy wisps and ring. lacing doesn't stick.
aroma: richer brett funkiness than the bottle i had from batch 1. same with the vinous and cider vinegar notes - like the bottle, but just more robust. tart, but with fresh fruit tones of grapes and currants. wood and leather hints with trace of oaky vanilla. fresh cranberry, red wine, cherries and possibly more currants show up again in the back.
taste is similar both to the aroma and overall to the bottled batch 1, but richer - even though here the draught lines are serving the beer at much colder temps. tart and dry with a lovely tannic finish, totally reminiscent of cabernet. full of flavors (wood, leather, farmhouse funk, fruit, hay, etc.)
medium body, nice and tart. acidic and astringent with tannins for structure and texture. cleaned up by both the acidity itself, but also the prickly yet fine and delicate carbonation.
whoa - where can i get more of this stuff?! i pray that the bottle sitting in my cellar will age into something like this...
thanks again to max and vinnie for making this happen! 1,285 characterschinabeergeek, Jun 27, 2009

A - Initial carbonation was high with a 2-3 finger head that dissapated quickly. Nice and dark like a fine brandy.
S - Funky and sour! Hard to believe there aren't any cherries in this one. I get a red wine vinegar, green apple, oak and sour grapes. This is gonna be good!!
T - Wow! Just like it smells, sour green apples, a hint of red wine vinegar and dark bitter cherries. I tried like hell but could not pick up the vanilla mentioned by other reviewers. Un-Godly well balanced!
M - Carbonation seemed high when I popped the cork, but was perfect on my palate. Dry and oh so tart with just the perfect acidity.
D - This is actually very scary. I did not even get a hint of alcohol here. 10%? It could be 2% and I would not have noticed. Yet even with alcohol taking a backseat, it was so satisfying that I wanted to prolong drinking this like no other. 
Overall, I don't see many sours coming close to this. Vinnie hits it on the head once again. May be arguably the best to come out of Santa Rosa ever. 1,181 charactersimblane, Jun 27, 2009

Looks rich and red like wine, smells sweet and fruity like wine, and has a very mild mouthfeel (mainly from the casket I'm sure) but very smooth like wine, and tastes like a sweet wine that's been out a little while, all the while still being a 10% beer that dances on the line of what is considered beer.
That being said, this is an incredibly unique beer that explores the boundaries of what beer can be. I loved it and was very sad when I reached the bottom of my 6 oz pour. Will definitely drink again! 602 charactersIrie, Jun 21, 2009
3.97/5  rDev -10%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Original bottling bought at Ledger's right from Ed. Poured into a small (12 oz) stemmed goblet.
Pours a fairly brite clarity with a deep wooden brown color. A big head rises up and disappears completely in a hurry, leaving absolutely no lace at all. It self-poured a bit of itself out of the bottle when the cork was removed.
Aroma has much depth and complexity and includes rich black currants (like preserves), green apple candy, sour cherries, vinegar, dark tobacco, sweet malts, and red wine.
Flavor is more of the same, with a strong medicinal note and a gentle tart blanket draped over everything else. Similar to a Flemish Sour Red with the malt bill but also has it's own thing going on. Alcohol is COMPLETELY disguised, no easy feat at 10-some-odd-% abv. No heat or esters either, no sign of stressed yeast. Lacto and pedio are the main contributors to the funk, and brett is certainly in there too. Finishes dry and similar to red wine. Some tannins.
Mouthfeel is gentle and friendly, no stickyness or chewyness, and a gentle fine carbonation.
Drinkable which is dangerous since the strength is cleverly hidden. Not extremely delicious so I'm not clammoring for the next sip, but certainly not bad at all. 
I liked this beer very much, but to me Compunction, Supplication, and Toronado are far superior. You can't go wrong, but for the heafty price tag I'd rather drink a Rodenbach Red. Cheers! 1,410 charactersrayjay, Jun 16, 2009

Deep dark ruby red/brown with a nice light brown/red foam forming to top off this brew. Aromas of berries- the currants are there for sure. Cherries, a peppery spiciness with a prickly carbonation. Complex funk mixes with vinous red wine grape characteristics. Another winner from Russian River- it'll be great for years to come. Very slight alcohol burn from the high ABV but it is not distracting from the brilliant marriage of tart, funk and fruit that take place in this beer.

Pours a clear translucent brown color with a full finger fizzy light tan head that is gone in a blink. No Belgian lacing afterward. The smell is great; sweet apple over a wine vinegar. Full flavored, the taste and nose are mirror images. Granny Smith Apple Ale flavor and tartness with a light body over an effervescent mouth feel that dries up quickly while leaving the fruity earthy notes and hint of a dark fruit linger nicely. A way too easy drinker...the 10% ABV provides a notch of warmth with the first mouthful, but is quite well integrated. I will savor this one as long as I can. Highly recommended. 674 charactersjjayjaye, Jun 13, 2009
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4750 ml bottle sent to me by the great rhinos00. This was actually the beer I was most excited about that he sent me in the Gentleman's Club BIF. This beer is special to me because it is the official beer that is helping me celebrate this Pen's Cup victory tonight. Big night for a big beer. Served up in a tulip, lets do this shit. Batch #1
A: Pours a dark brown in color. It actually does have some varied colors in here with an almost red/ruby/plum color coming across. I think a nice plum hue is the best way to describe the look, nice! Kinda a hint of dark red wine. The beer is pretty opaque, not seeing any light come through and I can't see through it for sure. The head was huge and when I popped the cork, there was a good amount of overflow coming out of the bottle. The head is almost a light brown in color and is about two fingers in height. Sadly, it falters quickly and I am getting no lace on the glas. Ah well, still a good looking brew.
S: Smell is nice for sure. Getting the Cab wine barrel aging for sure. Nice dark grape presence with a nice robust aroma. Then the sour kicks in. Getting some nice sour granny smith apples and some tart dark cherries coming across. A nice touch of some red wine vinegar in here bringing even more tart qualities. The oak is there with a slight sweetness coming from a touch of vanilla along with that nice wood. Very nice and absolutely appetizing. Well played, sir. 
T: Nice red wine vinegar up front, bringing the sour and tart first and foremost. Slapping you across the face with sour flavors. The fruits are some really tart green apples, dark ass cherries, and touch of sour and grainy pear. Really nice cab flavor comes across with dark grape acidity and a touch of the tannins. The grapes are dark and heavy but they still have a sweetness to them. Yet again you get that slight hint of oak, but the wine and grape translates a lot more. Just the slight sweetness from the vanilla from the oak creeps in. That sour really translates and the brett makes its presence known for sure with a slight touch of funk. Maybe just a touch of tobacco on the back end that brings that rich and dark earthiness. SOOOO, nice.
M: Medium in body that has a really nice carbonation (maybe a bit of a suprise). Actually pretty damn crisp and thirst quenching. Has a nice drying quality to it that is just enough to keep you pulling from the glass. The feel is tart and puckering but never gets unpleasant. ABV is nicely hidden where the drying quality is the most prevelant quality. Not really getting much warmth out of this beer from the ABV. The aftertaste is all the tart and sour flavors just mingling pleasantly on the palate. Awesome here.
D: Not a problem to drink at all. Sometimes I have a problem with some sours and wilds, but this one is easy to take care of. Actually refreshing as hell and has a nice and light drinkable quality. never have a problem taking another pull. A well crafted beer from start to finish. Sure I could use a bit more head and lace but screw it, the flavor, aroma and feel more than make up for that lack. Drink it if you got it. Great beer. 3,130 characterseveretends, Jun 13, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle (thanks to route66pubs!) into a 22 oz. brandy snifter
Pours a deep ruby red color with a one inch off-white head. It falls down to a half inch cap which holds up very well. No lacing is left behind though.
Aroma is full of wonderful funk, sour like green apples, currants definitely come through but blend in with a general dark fruit character. Oak is also slightly noticeable. 
Taste is sour from the start but there is actually a very slight sweetness in the back that plays very well with the sour. Lots of dark fruit character as well, currants come through again. Some funk and vinegar, but it's mostly pleasant sourness. Oak comes out in the finish. Excellent.
Mouthfeel is light in body due to a nice dryness. Silky going down with nice soft but effervescent carbonation. Very easy to drink.
By far the best sour that I've had the pleasure of drinking. Even better or equal to the Belgian sours. If you enjoy sours, then you absolutely must seek this one out. 985 charactersroadhouse, Jun 13, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750ml bottle purchased at liquidsolutions
Appearance: Nicy ruby to garnet body with a lovely silky frothy light mocha crown that pours large. Lots of retention and lacing with a silky slightly oily sheen!
Smell: This is one of the most intoxicating olfactory pleasures I've ever had. I'm really having a strong positive reaction to the nose. Nice amount of barnyard plus additional aromatics from the wild yeast come together with currants and other dark fruits. Nice oak notes dominate and create a wonderful musk. Leather and a light cigar note really round it out. Highbrow all the way.
Taste: First of the sourness is so well crafted. I can't believe I'm about to describe "sourness" as "velvety" but that is what I just did. The sourness is velvety smooth and lush. I'm getting a lemon/grape citric type note but I think that is coming from the wine barrel usage. The black currant mixes well and I feel like I'm getting other notes of black cherry.
Mouthfeel: Very lush and extremely carbonated.
Drinkability: I think this one will give me heartburn by the time I'm done but its damn tasty so its going down fast. :)
Batch 1 bottle consumed 6/4/10
Appearance: 4.0 the oily sheen is gone.
Smell: 4.0 Most of the intricate notes have faded and a general sweet malt plus vinous flavor profile has come to be.
Taste: 4.5 Sweet malt, vinous notes, and a nicely mellowed sour note. Very nice but not as good as it tastes fresh.
Mouthfeel: 4.0 The lushness and carbonation have mellowed a bit.
Drinkability: 4.5 still damn drinkable. 1,543 characterskoopa, Jun 13, 2009

Giving two 4.5's feels wrong, and the five in flavor seems a bit low. At any rate, the beer pours a translucent auburn with nice lacing. There are notes of red wine, currants (of course), cherries, malt and a wonderful sour like an incredible vinegar. The flavor is similar. The sour bites nicely. There's actual malt presence behind all of the fruit and sourness. The fruit flavors are refined and elegant. The whole thing is a wonderful experience. I can't imagine how they could improve on this flavor profile. The sourness blends with the fruit and malt at just the right level. There's also a dry oak flavor that keeps any possible sweetness in check. It drinks like a beer with half as much alcohol content. Bravo to everyone at Russian River. 858 characterspopery, Jun 12, 2009

Big fruit nose you wouldn't believe from the currant. notes of tart cherries, esters and red wine. I'm a Gueuze fan so the Sourness hit the spot. Flavors of Sour Cherries, oak, funk and some dry hops is in the background. Feels like a lightly carbonated red wine which made every sip one to remember.

Smell is (unsurprisingly) currants and dark fruit. The taste is really where this beer shines. Wonderful currant with an extremely tart, dry bite and a pleasant champagne carbonation. One of my favorite beers after the first sip. I'm glad I don't live in the bay area because I'd go broke drinking this. 390 charactersgyllstromk, Jun 10, 2009

Aroma is of dark fruit. Apples, cherries, and a touch of the oak. Has a good carbonation. The flavor is real good. A lot of sweetness but kicked up by a sour ending. Has a dry texture. This is a differnt style than I would normally drink but it is excellent. Has a great finish and the aftertaste stays with you for days. This is quite a tasty beer.

4.97/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml corked and caged bottle, $21.99 from Vendome in North Hollywood. Batch#002X1.
I have been looking for this beer for a while and it has been on the top of my list of beers wanted. I found it finally, secret stash at Vendome, not even on the shelves. Very sought after, hard to find beer.
Removing the cork comes a loud pop and the bubbles gradual pour over the bottle. 
A: Poured into a tulip glass, pours a warm opaque cherry red/brown with a two finger head that rapidly dissipates. Minimal lacing.
S: Cherries, vinegar, red wine, oak
T: Oak, sour vinegar, cherries, ripe red fruit and vanilla- true to the style of the beer, but very well rounded and better than any of the oak barrel aged sours I've ever had.
M: Fills the whole tongue and the entire mouth and holds there. Pleasant sour lingers for a long, long time. What a great texture; very layered, very complex.
D: Easy to drink, slight alcohol burn (in a good way), pleasant pucker.
This is far and beyond my favorite beer to date. Too bad it's so hard to find. Would love to get my hands on a case of this and age it. This one is made to be shared. Just awesome. This is the reason I drink beer. 1,171 charactersLaPeste, Jun 10, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had my sister bring me a couple bottles back for me from colorado. Definately worth it.
Poured a 22oz bottle from batch 001x2 into an oversized wine glass. much darker than i had expected, deep mahoney to purple i would say, providing little head that dissappeared quickly leaving minimal lace.
the smell is pleasantly sour, with fruity notes (raisins, currants, grapes) some spiceyness to, a bit dry...maybe even a little candied sugar.
this is a wildly delicious ale. a nice fruity tartness, dry from the cab sav. very pleasant as the fruitness lingers on the tongue. incredibly drinkable for a wild ale and 10%er. Not harshness.
definately need an open mind for this beer(most non BAs need not apply), but you will definately reep the benefits of a unique and delicious beer. not much to improve on only wish i had more... 829 charactersmikey711, Jun 09, 2009
4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Alas, a top ranked beer that doesn't disappoint.
I guess I expected a lighter colored beer to pour from the bottle, but the Flanders Red-looking beer runs from ruby red to cola brown and morphs into a classic Oud Bruin appearance. Much better head retention than most other Wild Ales which shows a lot of maltiness and protien character that keeps the beer inviting. Moderate retention and lacing accompanies the beer into its proper warmth.
Mouthwatering aromas of red wines, apples, tart berries, plumbs, grapes and... oh yea, cherries. (think skins of these fruits as much as the actual fruits themselves). Throw in a vineous, vinegar touch that keeps the beer sharp and clean. And, is this beer dry-hopped?- even in the nose, it takes on an Orval-like resemblence.
Flavors are a very directe carry-over from the nose with heavy emphasis on a clean, tart fruitiness with a strong malt foundation. Even a light detection of chocolate malts helps to envelop the aged fruit flavors and make a buffer between the pith and the acidity. Even with the clean lactic taste, these bugs do not disolve the beer into vinegar, but their restrained attenuation gives the beer a lot of malt flavor.
Likewise, the beer carries the maltiness into the mouthfeel. Again, the clean attenuation keeps the beer acidic, thin, and light while allowing a creamy maltiness to protect the beer from complete astringency. The beer carries the grape, cherry, and plumb taste and feel deep into the finish and with a clean apple aftertaste.
This beer may be the finest example of working with wild yeast and bacteria. Outstanding. 1,608 charactersBEERchitect, Jun 08, 2009

A - clear garnet brown with an off white head in a tulip. The head quickly receded to leave a thin white cap. Some spots of lace (but I attribute the lack of head to be the way they rinse the glasses).
S - earthy, sour, mild Belgian candi sweetness. Throw in some tart cherries and biscuity yeastiness and you've got yourself a lovely nose for this beer.
T - very acidic, sour, and vinegary green apples. Citrus (maybe of lime?) and some funky barnyard going on here. This is so good!
M - medium bodied and well carbonated. Quite smooth and gives a dry finish.
D - holy crap... this was my 2nd beer of the day this morning (the first was Pliny the Younger) and I can still drink more! 784 charactersDmanGTR, Jun 02, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #250 - Big thanks to Dave (d0b) for sharing one of these on New Beer Sunday. Batch 001X3 served in a Hopleaf tulip glass.
A - One finger of fairly quick-dissolving tan foam, that doesn't leave a ton of lacing, but settles into a nice ring that lingers throughout the drinking experience. Medium brown color, with firey red highlights at the edges of the glass and lots of tiny bubbles racing upwards. I know that it's possible to do better, even within the constraints of the style and ABV - see my description of Toronado 20th .
S - Lots of bretty funk, tart and sour currants, tobacco, sweet caramel malts, and wood. The mix of Belgian dark and wild ale is reminiscent of the T20th, but this is quite as nice, particularly the wood smell initially gave off a slightly plastic kind of smell before the brew warmed up.
T - The taste is a bit of a revelation, with lovely tartness, no discernible alcohol, a lovely red wine/Cabernet acidity, oak barrel, currants, and sweet caramel malts. There's significantly more sour and less funk here, and the flavors come together in a much more satisfying way. Since so much of this review is going to be ultimately very T20th influenced I'll mention that the oakiness and lacto-sour elements are much milder here, although I'm wondering if that is because of the age or the recipe itself...
M - Sticky, but with a dry finish, moderate carbonation, minimal alcohol heat, and medium body. Some cotton mouth but not where near as extreme as the Lou Pepe Framboise we had. Right on for the style.
D - Shockingly drinkable for a 10% wild ale. Great aftertaste and negligible carbonation burn or bloat. Other than the (slight) problem of getting stupidly drunk from a 750ml bottle this is terrific stuff.
A couple thoughts...
This is a superb substitute for Toronado 20th. While clearly a different beer it does a lot of the same things very well - blending two classic Belgian styles (quad/dark ale with gueuze/lambic), hiding a ridiculously 10%, and marrying a whole host of wonderful and seemingly incongruous flavors. The only place is comes up short is in the appearance, and that doesn't really influence my drinking enjoyment all that much. And when one factors in the huge price differential...
Batch variation seems to be pretty obvious. I didn't get that vague plastic smell from the batch 001x4 bottles I've sampled. I'll comment further when I open up my own bottle at some point. I'm also looking forward to batch 002. 2,480 charactersMasterSki, Jun 01, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is one of the best beers I've had. Pours a dark reddish brown with some cloudiness. My gentle pour left a substantial head that fell away to a tan lacing in my Westy chalice.
Rich boozy alcohol with some great sour brett yeasties. Slight vinegar and a good amount of oak in the aroma.
Huge mouthwatering explosion of flavor here. This brew is holding nothing back. Wave of sweet vinous and dark fruit hit first, then the wave of sour goodness. Great barnyard phenolic funk, all sorts of great yeast esters. Wonderfully tart and crisp, like biting into a granny smith apple. Finish arrives with some rich oakiness and the alcohol lingers with its warmth. This is an A+ beer in every respect. It reminds me of a sour quad. The alcohol isn't overkill, it really adds to the experience at its current level. The level and balance of sour to sweet to spice is so perfect that I want to drink this...not just sip it. It's incredibly drinkable and the aftertaste keeps pulling me back in. Mouthfeel is completely full and satisfying.

Batch 001X4
A- Pours a dark reddish brown that is sort of mahogany in color with a fairly prominent one finger foamy head. It dissipates really quickly and doesn't leave a cap or collar but I'm biased. Half point higher because I'm so pumped.
S- Slightly woody and tart with a semi vinous red grape dimension. Earthy and clean at the same time with some apple cider vinegar and raisin bran. Light cherry with a sort of minor musky funk and Brett backdrop. The 10% is no where to be found in the nose.
T- Starts with a lightly tart/sour kick that is amazingly smooth and pleasant. Mushroom and ham (yes ham) add a very earthy funk component that is sort of salty and sweet. Tobacco, leather, teriyaki beef jerky and compost add even more earthy goodness before the Cabernet sets in. Red grapes, prunes and figs are somewhat fruity and raw. The beer hasn't reached totally puckering sour yet but it will eventually. As of now it's just slightly sour and awesome. Finishes with some vanilla and oak and lots of thick black fruity goodness.
M- Medium to light body with a sharp carbonation and pleasant feel. Again, 10% my ass...
D- Wow... This brew is amazing. So earthy and drinkable with a fantastic fruity quality that isn't sweet or bitter. Unlike anything I've tasted to this point. I was expecting a straight up sour with a slight fruity dimension but not so. Awesome stuff, thanks Matt! 1,611 charactersyounger35, May 29, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very dark brown that shows some red when held to light. Head is on the low side of medium and dies pretty quickly.
Aromas are tart and woody with sour cherries, big dry Cabernet, and some light funk.
More cherries and other fruit on the palate, some vinegar-esque pedio acidity, red wine dryness, and high amounts of lacto sour. As it warms I'm getting some powdery unsweetened chocolate, bittersweet blackberry, and more woody tannins. 
The amazing complexity of this one makes it tough to pick up on the 10% ABV and keeps this very drinkable. The medium natural carbonation is well complimented by the long draw of dry/sour to keep the mouthfeel interesting.
Overall my favorite wild ale to date. Truly world class. Vinnie & co have hit another one out the park. Don't miss this one. 797 charactersberkey, May 29, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Large corked bottle, poured into a tulip. 
Dark brown, burgundy highlights, minimal haziness, tan head that is quite fluffy and good looking but shows minimal retention, some lacing. This might be its only "flaw".
Aroma is quite tart, acidic and even vinegary, fruity, with the expected currants but a lot of other dark fruits. Oak makes a cameo appearance, as well as grapes and tobacco. 
Rich yet fully carbonated, which makes it quite drinkable. ABV 10 only shows on the bottle; in the glass it is nowhere to be found. 
The rich flavor shows multiple notes, including oak, acidity and a nice tartness; multiple fruits, mostly currants and raisins. The tartness and sourness hits you with a nice puckering bite, not excessive but just right. 
Vinegar, tobacco, cherries, grapes and even vanilla eventually show up. 
This is an incredibly tasty, complex and rich beer that is well deserving of the hype. The best RR I ever had, and I am glad I have more. 
The tartness keeps begging for more. 994 charactersbrdc, May 28, 2009

pours a great crystal clear brown that shows nice garnet and ruby hues when held to the light. a small ring of tan bubbles surrounds the glass, never quite gathering enough strength to cover the surface. a few spots of lace.
aroma is good. malt vinegar. bit of lemon. puckering sourness, that's before even taking a sip. old leather. bit of horse blanket. white bread. cracker. bit of grain. dark fruit - plum, date, currant. bit of lighter fruit too. orange peel. bit of alcohol.
taste is good. puckering sourness, but more lemon+fruit than vinegar. sour cherry. currant. bit of malt vinegar. cracker and white bead. bit of grain. low bitterness level. medium sourness. fairly low acidity. orange peel. grapefruit.
mouthfeel is good. fairly light body. nice dry finish. just over medium carbonation level.
drinkability is pretty good. the alcohol is very well hidden. vinegar and acidity is pretty well balanced. nice fruity depth. not my favourite RR sour, but damn tasty. 1,100 charactersgrub, May 27, 2009

A - This beer looks amazing. A nice cherry dark red with a smooth half inch creamy head.
S - The smell is sour upfront, followed by a nice sweetness.
T - Sour Sour Sour. This beer starts off very sour and slows into a bitter cherry flavor. The sweetness finishes off this nice beer.
M - This beer is perfectly carbonated. The head hits your lips smoothly, and the dry finish leaves you wanting more.
D - This beer is one of those heavy hitters that you want to drink it all day, all night, but also want to savor it and take your time. Also, you would'nt want to session this at the price, but that does not reflect on the rating :). This beer however, can be overpowering due to the sourness, but other than that, high drinkability.

Pours a clear dark reddish orange, some amber highlights, thin off white head forms, quickly drops to a thin ring around the glass before almost disappearing, some lace spots stick to the glass. Smell is real nice, currants and funk, sour fruity, cranberries, alcohol, candi sugar, grapes and oak, vanilla, very sour and acidic in the finish, nice complex tropical fruitiness, does remind me a bit of the Toronado 20th. Taste is similar, lemony up front, very sour and funky, acidic, caramel/honey sweetness, currants and grapes, sour fruit, oak and vanilla, very dry in the finish, tons of fruit, sourness is not overdone.

A- Pours a brown-cabernet sauvignon color with garnet hues throughout. A thin layer of cream colored head formed and disappeared quite quickly.
S- Very complex. Nice oak barrel presence. In addition there was a subtle vinegar scent mixed with a more dominant vinous quality that came from the cabernet barrels and currants. Beautifully done, very potent. I could take whiffs of this over and over again.
T- Just perfect. Up front you get a lot of qualities that would most likely be found in complex wines. Very vinous, with grape tannins and currants running rampant. Midway through to the finish there is an oak sourness that balances out the beer perfectly. It takes the sweetness from the initial taste and gives it a sour twist at the perfect moment. 
M- This really hampered the beer. Way too much carbonation. Upon reaching the pallet it seemed as if a million carbonated bubbles formed and kept the true taste of the beer from ever reaching the senses. 
D- This is one of the most drinkable sours I have ever had. If I could give it a 6 I would. The aging in cabernet barrels really did this beer a favor as it dulled down the sourness until the end. Makes it much more drinkable. I could easily drink a whole 750 mL bottle without sharing.
If you can get your hands on this, buy it. One of the better sours out there. Well balanced and gives a nice sour flavor without being overly acidic. Highly recommended. 1,494 charactersrhinos00, May 16, 2009

4.02/5  rDev -8.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a wine glass and produced a ruby-brown color when held up to the light and appeared dark brown in normal lighting. Half inch head with almost no retention. Lively, visible carbonation. No lacing during the drinking period.
Aroma of funk; that wet leather aroma common to wild fermented ales. There was, however, a strong aroma of black currants and cherries interwoven with the mildew aroma.
Flavor was a very tart, vinegar sour flavor. There was a tannic flavor like a soft red wine lingering in there and a lemon-salty finish. Very interesting and complex.
Full bodied mouthfeel with a lingering dark cherry and sour funky flavor on the tongue. Very carbonated, making this brew a sipper.
Hard to chug this brew but with a $25 price tag, you wanna sip on this brew for all its worth. Looking forward to having some more of this. 846 charactersdavexisxrabid, May 12, 2009

4.02/5  rDev -8.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4450th review. Batch 001x2. Poured from a 750ml bottle into my NBB snifter after letting warm up to around 50 degrees. It opened with an explosive pop and poured a deep mahogany color. The head was disappointing. It was a fizzy brown that never really reached much height or even cover the whole surface. It also quickly faded to nothing. Some faint carb streams. No lacing.
The aroma was also a bit of a letdown. I love RR sour aromas and read some good reviews on this but mine was sorta subtle. No smack in the face funk or sour. It had a good currant and tart cherry aroma plus some oak and wine. Was good but just wish it was more present. Also maybe a little funk as well. Fortunately the taste was really good and had a crisp, sour bite. The finish was very dry and tart. I enjoyed this one but I still would rather have a Supplication or Temptation over it. With those, I could finish the bottle and be immediately seeking trades for another one. Halfway thru this one I was thinking a smaller size bottle would be better.
Overall, a really good AWA from RR but is missing a couple elements from being a classic. Still very enjoyable but not the "I'd kill my mother to get it" like Supplication or Temptation for me. Do highly recommend. I've got one left for cellaring so curious to see how this one ages. 1,315 charactersTexIndy, May 10, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #100. Thought I would go with a beer I love on tap but have not yet sampled out of the bottle.
750ml poured into a Chimay chalice. Part of Batch 001x4. This bottle was purchased the first day that it went on sale (PTY release day) and has been sitting in my cellar. Comes in at 10%.
A-Serious pop when the cork is taken out of the bottle. Pours a dark brown, which held in front of the light becomes a glowing red. Has a one finger tan head that dissolves into a nice ring and leaves filmy patterns that resemble different Rohrschach patterns. There is also a constant stream of bubbles popping up from the bottom of the glass.
S-It smells like the inside of a wine cave. There are definite notes of funk and must, as well as red grape and oak from the cabernet barrels. Sour fruit is also quite evident.
T-Sour and tart cherries and currants immediately wallop the tongue and this is really what stands out during the first few sips. As my tongue opens up to the sour and tart flavors, the oak and red grape flavors from the cabernet barrels become very evident. This beer leaves an extremely dry finish on the tongue and reminds me in a lot of ways of Korbel's Sparkling Brut Rouge.
M-Medium bodied, great carbonation, crisp, and dry.
D-The 10% is nowhere to be found. It is a great sipper that gets better as my tongue gets more and more used to the sour and tart notes. About as perfect as you can get for a sour.
A great beer to mark #100 on BA. Consecration and Supplication are without a doubt my two favorite sours from Russian River. The bottled version was as good, if not better, than the version I have enjoyed many times up at the pub in Santa Rosa. 1,676 charactersmjl21, May 09, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass.
A- Poured a murky deep brown with exceptionally lively carbonation which left a tan/caramel colored soda-like head that came and went very fast. Carbonation ribbons did not cease until the end of the drink.
S- Intoxicating and complex. Seemingly imbibed with some sort of dark magick. Alcohol is present here but not overwhelming. Bites the nose with a tangy ripeness of dried fruit. Dates, raisins, currants, dark earth spice and black pepper. Smoke. Just a hint of sweet caramel appears when swirled. Truely complex. I don't think I am qualified to describe this in its fullest.
T- A fragile malt background wants to get through the sourness of this beer. Its there but is overpowered by sour grapes, cranberries, and apricot. Dried currants shine through here as well. This ale becomes more balanced and less aggressive to the senses as it warms up.
M- Light, active, cleansing. Seems to leave no part of the mouth unaffected.
D- Share this one with someone. An ale which needs to be experienced by many. This ale is definitely not for all but is an excellent example of true artistry at work. Beers (and breweries) like this give me hope for the industry and make me proud to say I am a beer drinker (and maker). Thumbs up for originality and passion. My hat is off to you Vinnie. 1,336 charactersSFBeerGuy, May 08, 2009

Batch 001X2, cage-corked bottle.
Pours hazed deep mahogany with a styro-foamish head that thins.
The smell is of red grape - vinuous with currants and oak. Some tart black cherry as well.
The taste is of tart black cherries with black currents. Some and sour, funky with some wood. A firm darkish maltiness supports it. It has a vinuous, dry finish.
It is effervescent. Alcohol there, but reasonably well-hidden.
In some ways wine-like, but with a funky, malty character. Well-balanced - sweet and sour but not too much in one direction. An interesting, delicious, unique, sipper. 624 charactersjwc215, May 03, 2009

t: This is difficult to describe, so I'm not going to force it by using words that don't quite fit. This is more wine like than any gueuze and more tart than any wine. Fresh, musty, and tart all at once. Just absolutely perfect.
m: Fizzy, refreshing carbonation and lip smacking tartness.

4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Served at TJs a few weeks back, from my notes:
Pours a ruby color, no real head slight amounts of bubbles forming
The nose has hints of bourbon, woodiness (oak), and a bit of vinegary funkiness, but in a subtle way
The flavor has dark fruits, some acid, and a great backing of funkiness
The acid ensures a crisp dry finish, really nice on the tongue, warm and very pleasant. 378 charactersmhatters, May 02, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I received this amazing Russian River Sour from BrewerB - thank you my friend!
Poured a few ounces at a time into a Duvel glass this beer is deep rich and has a bronzish reddish hue to it. There is a fluffy white head that recedes to a thin lacing at the top of the glass.
The smell is of red wine, brett, and that infamous "horse blanket" musk. The smells really work together.
Taste is extremely tart and refreshing. There is a huge rush of lemons and limes then the wine flavors with the oak take over. Finally the finish is oaked currants and cabernet grape overtones.
The mouthfeel is very light and spritzy. There is a massive amount of carbonation but very well placed for the style. This adds to the refreshing aspect of this beer.
Overall this is a very drinkable sour in that I can and will drink the entire bottle on my own. I would not, however, reach for a second bottle in one night as the bacterias, alcohol, and whatnot of a sour will wrech havoc on the intestinal tract.
Overall this is an amazing sour and an extremely flavorful example of Russian River's ability. Thank you Brian for trading this gem to me. 1,132 charactersPerzentRizen, May 02, 2009

T: Excellent level of sourness. A lot of complexity in the flavor. Lots of tartness paired with some citrus and sweet fruits.

4.75/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep reddish brown color -- has some ruby highlights when held up to the light. Nice big light khaki head -- very nice carbonation. It's not a big mess of head, but a careful pour is necessary to keep this one in check.
Blown away by the amount of wine and grape in the nose. I wasn't expecting a big hit from the Cab Barrels, but it is there for sure, and it matches perfectly with the sour berry smells. The oak balances it out a little.
Taste is over the top -- perfect combination of sour bite and fruity, oaky smoothness. They don't seem like things that necessarily go together, but this one has it all. Aside from the chewy and viscous feel, you could have convinced me this had half the ABV it does -- so perfectly hidden away. 
Could easily down this one quickly, but it would be such a shame to get to the end any faster than necessary. This is the type of beer that makes you want to go back and rethink some previous ratings -- completely redefined what the style can be. 994 charactersBcaulin, Apr 28, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Pours a reddish brown color with a tan/creamy head. The head doesn't have much retention, leaves a small ring of bubbles around the edge of my glass, and not too much on the lacing side either. 
S- Smells of a woody oak aroma, heavily ripened currants give way to spicy yeast,red wine like and grapes mixed with sour citrus. 
T- Taste is the sour cherries and currants are sour, tart and little acidic. Alcohol is hidden very well 10% abv really where's it at.

A nice, deep red color... like cherry cough medicine... which I happen to find gorgeous. Oh yeah, the perfect tan head is all right too!
Lots of currant in the nose... some cherry, oakiness and funk.
Catching a lot of currant in the taste along with sour cherries and raisins on the back end. This is magnificent. 
Wild Ales are not usually my bag, but how can you turn down a healthy and free 6oz pour? I'm glad I did... this stuff is incredible. Perhaps it was the muted funkiness that I loved so much, but Russian River continues to do no wrong. 640 charactersrudylaw, Apr 27, 2009

A: Deep translucent reddish amber, with a little over a finger of tan head. The head dissipates pretty quickly, but leaves a layer of foam on the surface. Some lacing, but not a lot.
S: Dark sweet fruit. Complex, malty, and deep.
T: Wow. Like no beer I've tried before (but then I am new to this style). Lots of fruit, but not too sweet. Tons of flavor here, somewhat comparable to a fruit forward wine. Tart citrus flavors on the tip of the tongue, leading to a malty sour flavor, with a dry finish. The alcohol is well hidden. Quite interesting.
M: Great carbonation. Feels very nice.
D: This is a sipper for sure. The sour flavors and the high ABV mean that this is one to take it slow with.
This is the first beer of this style I've tried. I would not want to drink this all the time, but as something occasional to mix things up it works well. This beer isn't cheap, but it's probably worth having one or two in the cellar. 999 charactersseand, Apr 27, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Appearance - Murky reddish-brown with a thick tan head.
Smell - Currant, vinegar, slight oak, a touch of brown sugar, and a bit of apricot or pear.
Taste - Very tart fruit flavors, namely the currants and apples with a bit of the apricot/pear again. Vinegary a bit, but all of it hides the alcohol fairly well. Very, very dry/astringent on the finish.
Mouthfeel - Thick and dry, a thin but plentiful carbonation.
Drinkability - I'm not a huge sour fan, but I had to try this one. Definitely a pleasant beer, though the tart can be a bit overwhelming at times. If it wasn't $20 a bottle I would probably revisit this. 620 characterssevopie, Apr 20, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Dark brown with bright ruby red highlights when held up to light. Almost cola like in appearance. Big, bubbly light brown head and audible fizzing. Head does not last long but does leave pretty good lacing. Lots of bubbles quickly rising to the top.
S - Strong aroma of brandy soaked cherries and raisins. A nice light vinegar aroma lingers underneath as well. Hints of vanilla and oak as well.
T - An excellent array of tastes come at you and the balance is just amazing. Starts off with a nice sour fruitiness with cherries and raisins, much like the aroma. The sour tastes fade to a more vinegar based tartness later in the drink. Throughout there is a nice underlying oakiness with hints of vanilla that provide an excellent balance to the sour/tart tastes throughout. Just an excellent array of flavors that play off each other wonderfully. I'm still new to the world of American Wild's, but this has to be darn near perfection.
M/D - Full bodied with an incredibly lively carbonation. The beer tickles your mouth and throat the whole way down. Ridiculously easy drinking as well. 1,092 charactersckeegan04, Apr 19, 2009

Pours light brown with a tan/creamy head into my Duvel tulip. Not much lacing along the glass and the head quickly goes away leaving a small tan rim along the sides of the tulip. The smell is amazing, green apples, very sour, but in a great way. Taste is great, lip-puckering sour, but it's just as if I'm drinking a nice cabernet or pinot noir...wow. Lots of fruit up front and a great mix of sweetness and tart on the finish (makes me want MORE!). Mouthfeel is perfect...just the correct amount of carbonation with this wild..really helps the flavors. I would say this is right down the middle in terms of body, medium. Drinks like a wine with some carbonation, very nice. I still have a few bottles left and they won't be around too long as much as I enjoyed this one! An awesome wild. 962 charactersSean9689, Apr 17, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a tulip. Consumed at a tasting with a handful of fellow BA's. Review is from tasting notes.
I'll preface this by saying Consecration is my first Wild Ale. I had read rave reviews, but it just didn't sound like my style. Of course, I ended up loving it, and it was one of the best of a stellar lineup of beers that night.
Pours a color on the redder side of purple, like the inside of a red grape skin. Nice amount of foam. Rich and creamy head.
Wow, this thing smelled sour. Tons of fruit...my notes had "TART" written along the side. Sinus-clearing sour. The taste is appropriately mouth-puckeringly sour. Currants, oak, and red wine. The flavor floored me. I didn't think this kind of flavor could be in a beer. Nice heat in the back of the throat that rises to the nose. This beer was stronger than I thought it was. Nice bitter finish. 
Very, very smooth feel. Light astringency, definitely not unpleasant, leaves a very nice tingle on the tongue. Nice, even coating made me feel like I needed to brush my teeth afterward. I was really sad to see the bottom of the glass. For my first Wild Ale, I thought it was highly drinkable. I really hope I'll be able to attain this sometime over the summer. 1,231 charactersGyle41386, Apr 17, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to gcphilli for the great trade that yielded this puppy (batch 001X2) - into a Portsmouth snifter it goes after an excellent pop of the cork from this 750 corked & caged heavyweight.
Well, it pours with a ginger/maple head - about 1/3 finger - that looks like sponge candy for a brief instant then fades quickly into little yeast wisps. The body has a dark bourbon and dark cherries (OK, currants) color that has quite a calming effect. Moderate slow-moving carbonation.
The scent is present the second the cork goes. The brett is huge but it's backed by a fruity sweetness of the currants with a light, husky oak barrel and wine tannic feel. Quite complex with a touch of hop pine and slight booziness. I expected it to be sweet but this is really well-integrated. Can't see too much of anything wrong with this.
The carbonation really shows up and brightens things a bit on taste. It gets together with the very soft and sour funk (not as heavy as a horse blanket - maybe a horse do-rag) and the oaky Cab character isn't a figment of one's imagination...nor is the poignant taste of currants. Way back when in the early 1980s Haagen-Dazs had a cassis (currant) sorbet available at their shop on the Upper West Side. It was one of those things that wasn't for everyone but we enjoyed the hell out of it. This brings back those tastes. Slightly austere but still pronounced currants along with the Cab tannin just makes this outstanding and the carbonation brings the delivery even greater strength. In fact I'd almost want this to still a little bit to see how it would go. Quite luxurious to say the least. A little warmth brings out the expected horse blanket feel even further, which fits with everything else like a glove. Seriously Beautiful Chemistry going on here (look up Crackstatic and Ron Hawkins). This begs to be aged - like a young Cab there is a sense of tightness that begs for aging.
It took a while for my palate to embrace the concept of the Wild Ale but lots of good things take time. Surprisingly with time and warmth the dry oakiness of this gets to be more prominent and the straight sour texture of the currants is enhanced - the carbonation isn't going away and it helps hammer the point home. This one waxes and wanes - every moment the spotlight shines on a different element.
It doesn't take long to realize that this is indeed a 10% sledgehammer. But there is nothing that can diminish how good this thing is. My cellar awaits for another bottle. What will this taste like in a few years? I am drinking this very slowly but I am enjoying every sip. Not that I'm a sour maven by any means but this is the best one I've experienced to date. In-fucking-credible. 2,701 charactersIBUnit63, Apr 17, 2009

The flavor is big mouth puckering tart and sour fruits, some wood, with a musty yeast finish. It's a bit acidic. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low yet sharp carbonation.

A deep garnet color, calm looking brew. This beer is both complex yet accessible and quite easy to drink all at the same time. Tartness and raisiny currents in the nose, a big of soaked woodsy oak. At first taste this beer has a tart but not necessarily very sour kick to it, then mellowing into deep fruit and a soft funk. Very balanced and subtle, yet plenty of flavor and very arousing to the tastebuds. Slight grape husk vinous character imparted from the barrel aging. Really excellent. Prickly and juicy on the palate but with a tart dry finish and highly quaffable. A real gem. 677 characterstwelvsies, Apr 13, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I loved this beer. In a few words, it is a solid ale base with a fruit overlay.
Had three bottles of the 001x2 batch. Very consistent every time (I also had a tulip from a keg to compare dissimilar batches). I am cellaring one to see what time will yield.
This beer, despite its youth, is complex. Poured into my Chimay goblet (and wine glasses) a deep ruby with a double finger of clean head. The layers in this beer arrive in stacatto fashion but, like a good risotto, have spent time accumulating.
What hit me first was the tartness of the currants. This fruit yielded to the mellowness of what must have been from the oak. I suspect that if you could strip out the currants and oak you would be left with a solid dark Belgian, but I foud it tricky to completely disambiguate. The mouthfeel was solid and the aftertaste was pleasant.
I understand that Brett was used along with two other usual suspects, but I could not discern any obvious rotting humus or bovid urine, rather just the usual organic yeast remnants. 1,022 characterschiral3, Apr 12, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours a very dark brown, almost black. When held to the light, it was brown and light amber and surprisingly clear. A fluffy 1-finger head formed, but quickly dissipated to a thin ring around the glass.
S- Very complex aroma. The first things that hit the nose are sweet, dark fruits and notes of ester. Belgian yeast and breadyness comes through followed by funky sour tones. Hints of cherries or currants come through clearly. Slight hints of vanilla and a wine-like aroma come through as well.
T- Very sour upfront, but the sourness isn't so overpowering that it masks the complexities of the beer. Sour cherries and currants come through immediately in the flavor. The sourness melds with the fruit well, but there is still the slight funky flavor associated with brett. The finish is very clean and wine-like with a lingering sour aftertaste. The esters of the "base" beer before it hit the barrels come through very clearly.
M- The body is somewhat thin and its slightly over-carbonated, but the absolutely amazing clean and crisp finish make up for it.
D- I split a 750mL bottle with two friends and I wanted more after 1/3 of the bottle. Overall, extremely well-rounded. One of the few American Wilds that I've had that's not sour for the sake of being sour, but sour to impart flavor to the rest of the beer...Another excellent brew by RR. 1,355 charactersJoeMayo, Apr 11, 2009

4.77/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review #100 - and a damn fine choice if I do say so myself.
A - Pours a deep, dark ruby red. Virtually opaque. Dark like Chimay Blue is dark. Beautiful garnet highlights. Light tan head is two fingers tall and big bubbled. Not a lot of staying power on the head, and little lacing to speak of.
S - The fruit makes its presence known immediately. Both dark (raisin & plum) and red (cherry & raspberry) fruit pay a role. The barrel influence is a big part, giving solid red wine and vanilla overtones. The wild yeast adds an earthy, horsey funk. A bit of booze tops it all off. this is the kind of beer that gives you something new with every whiff. Incredible depth.
T - Again, the fruit hits first.The dark/red emphasis seems to shift from sip to sip, sometimes giving more plum, sometimes more raspberry and cherry. I imagine I'm tasting currant at times, but I usually don't eat currants, so its hard to have a real basis for comparison. The Cab flavors play a part in the front as well, imparting their own unique fruitiness. The oaky, vanilla flavors come in the middle and on the sides, where the musty earth of the brett makes its presence known. The sour aspect hits with a bang toward the end which, along with the oak and wine tannin, makes for a super clean finish.
M - Medium-full body, but the carbonation is a bit coarse, which along with the acidity and tannin, makes for a very snappy feel.
D - I could drink this stuff all night. I'm actually having to tell myself to drink it slowly in order to savor it. the 10% abv is barely noticeable.
This is a top ten beer for me, no doubt. Delicious and creative, worthy of the awe it inspires. 1,657 characters0110x011, Apr 10, 2009
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4My first crack at a wild or sour beer, but it was a great new experience..The pour yields a cloudy, glowing, rusty sienna colored body with a lasting, pillowy, cream colored head. Minimal, spotty lacing shows on the glass. Aromas include a dark, fruity malt base rich with currants and some sour cherry. Dry cocoa adds a hint of sweetness, while soft, oaky vanilla lends a perfumy, lightly woody overtone. Traces of bretty funk add an earthy character. Flavors show more dark fruits, primarily tart dark cherry, fig, and currant, mild sourness being tempered by the soft, oaky carress. The body is substantial and semi-dry, perfectly carbonated.

2.8/5  rDev -36.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 1.5 |  overall: 2Paid $23.99 for a 750ml bottle from Perry's Liquor in Livermore, CA. Batch 001X3. Poured into a large wine glass.
Upon cracking the cage n corked bottle, the beer spilled rather quickly out of the top of the bottle. Beware to have a glass ready with this one! Perhaps it was shaken a bit as upon pouring as the head is quite small actually. Quite fizzy, this off white head dissipates to almost nothing very quickly. Carbonation is quite tricky/deceiving. Color is deep ruby red. Its darkness leads to this being nearly opaque. No retention.
Smells of wild yeast funk and very fine tart cherries. Also a grape complexity added a la aging in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels. Mildly sweet, yet certainly much more on the sour side. Even some breadiness from the yeast.
Sour to the taste buds resulting in strong astringency. Funk, sour cherries, some grape. Not as complex as the nose. A bit too sour for my liking.
Very dry mouth, astringent. Light to medium bodied. Light carbonation. As dry as some champagne I've had, which for me, is not a positive quality I'm looking for in a beer. 1,085 charactersibbjamin, Apr 08, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Trouble's afoot, no doubt about it. The dark ruby is evidence. Perfect clarity and little head, but what becaps the brew remains throughout. Not really an eerie feeling, but a restlessness, as a cloudy, windy, brooding day is apt to be - one can tell it's not right. There's a dark shape. They must not catch up.
The aroma of lambic, lambic sour. Each individual one is there, showcased, though the mighty brett overrides at long last. The pediococcus adds an extra twist to the otherwise normal blend of saccharomyces and brett. And the rest of the mix too, the basket-full, the nuts, bread, figs, dried apricots, grapefruit peel.
Ride North! They are coming for us!
Brandishing but a pike, the tastebuds assaulted by a complex sweet and sour: a light bready/date-like sweetness, destroyed in short order (not so soon... why? Where's the plot?) by the immense sourness that leaves the rest of the mouth frozen.
At least it isn't raining. We may make the range before dark. At least it's dry. Intensely dry. Stifling. Astringent. Drier than anything from Belgium, save a 10-year old of some sort.
Make for the hills. Ride. Do not look back at the looming thunderstorms, they are not there. Ride. Your freedom is at stake, your entire world. You must not let them catch you. Ride for your life. 1,293 characterskhiasmus, Apr 07, 2009

Popped the cork and was greeted with a rush of foam. Ran it into the kitchen and set in the sink. Lost perhaps an eighth of the contents. Now that was rather disappointing.
After cleaning up the spillage, poured into a snifter. Attractive amber with a golden halo and a thin, fizzy head that eventually dissolves.
Smells tart with a fruitiness that I presume is the currants. Slight, earthy, oakiness as well.
Taste is tart and sour, with a definite presence of the wild yeast. Divine, oaky finish. Very delicious.
Mouthfeel is excellent as well- crisp, dry and tingly, like a fine champagne.
I can't believe this is 10% ABV. It is completely concealed. I would love to continue on to another bottle when I finish this one, but this is far too precious a beer to treat in such a frivolous manner. 822 charactersWilliamD, Apr 07, 2009
4.05/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A corked and caged 750 mL bottle of Batch 001-3. I received several in recent trades, so thanks to beerbeagle, jw347 and ralflord.
A: The ale is a dark crimson red that has a full wooden brown appearance from afar. A loud pop didn't conjure up as much head as I wanted, nor did what popped up linger for long.
S: The ale has a vinous aroma, the long barrel-aging stint put to good use. The wine is red and very full-bodied. Tartness is behind the red wine but not as strong as I've experienced in other RR wild ales.
T: The currants are strong up front, sweet and juicy. As the currants fade, red wine and oaky tartness come through. The red wine is cabarnet, full and rich. The barrel has added a subtle tartness that goes well with the wine. The tartness is citric, very acidic. The bite is nice, a natural flow from the fullness of the red wine.
M: The currant/red wine/oak barrel interplay is interesting. Tartness follows full barrel and sweet berries. The currants are a nice deviation from grapes.
D: The 10% alcohol never rears its head. The ale is very approachable with a pleasant tartness that never makes me pucker too much. 1,141 charactersakorsak, Apr 06, 2009

Pour gives a lovely ruddy ruby color with mild bubbles that don't stick around, I guess they were feeling shy.
Smell of a nice sour Cabernet.
The taste is wonderful, sour, funky, fruity. Currants up front then the sour acidity followed by the leathery brett.
Mouthfeel is again wonderful, good carbonation.

A: Pours dark brown with very little khaki colored bubbles around the edge, possibly due to a careful pour.
S: Smells sour/wild fruit, specifically like funky apple cider, yeasty
T: Similar to the smell, very much like funky apple cider with some yeasty flavors and a sour bite, very tart
M: full and highly carbed
D: At this point, one 12oz bottle would be more than enough for me until I got into the style.
I think at some point I will be able to appreciate this style, but it's too radical to me right now to feel comfortable with it. I can totally see how people enjoy this beer a lot though, but I think it's an acquired taste that I just haven't acquired yet. 836 charactersdukedevil0, Apr 03, 2009

Thanks Kyle! This beer poured a mahognay brown with some ruby highlights and a fizzy, highly carbonated two-finger thick head of tan foam that quickly settled into a lasting cap. Some slippery lacing. The aroma included strong oak, vinous dark fruits, and lightly sweetened tart currants. Some lightly sour notes. Definately a strong wine character. Nice mix of sweet and sour. The flavor displayed a fairly intense oaky, wine barrel character. Tart currants followed by a mellow acidity. A lingering woody, cherry pit note was left on the tongue. The 10% ABV was undetected. Finished mostly dry, but there was still some unexpected sweetness lingering. Medium-bodied with crisp, aggressive carbonation. Very well done. Quite a bit more tart, and not nearly as sour as expected, but it works. A wonderful beer! 925 charactersmdm46410, Apr 03, 2009

4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at O'Briens (San Diego, CA) on 3/20/09. Part of a full day of Russian River beers here. Served in a Chimay glass.
Pours a deep clear ruby amber color with a ½ finger of creamy beige colored head. Thin wispy retention that flares up nicely into a frothy cascade of rich lacing that clings to the sides of the glass. Just a beautiful looking beer here. The aroma is quite dense smelling with oaky tannins, and a light vinegar sourness. Underneath of that emerges dark cherries, hints of vanilla, and a nice bit of candied sugary sweetness. Light warth invades the profile as well, giving off just the slightest feel of a fume to the bouquet. 
The taste is souring acidic oak and black currants up front that really stand out and add a certain amount of denseness to the profile. Vanilla creeps in before a blast of tartness from the wild yeasties makes itself known. The overall profile is a touch souring at first but then lessens into a more tart feel as this warms. Very nice. I'm also getting some underlying sugary notes, that when mixed with the tartness in the profile, gives this that pleasant Sweetart taste that I like so much in these Russian River Sours. Dry tartness lingers lovingly on the palate. Nice. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a lower carbonation and overall slick feel to it but the little bit of creaminess that does reside in the body is pleasant, intermingling with the more viscous character and moving all of those big flavors nicely. Oh, and 10% on this? I would have never guessed. We actually had to check a case of this that was sitting near our table for the ABV and couldn't believe it! 
Another Wild work of art here. The melding of the oak, cherries, and wild yeasts in this was just fantastic and the drinkibility was quite good for a beer of this size. Awesome. 1,814 charactersKegatron, Apr 02, 2009
4.17/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I had this on tap at Capone's during the Sunday morning event that occurred on March 29th 2008.
The color was purplish brown in color with a copper hue when held up to the light. The liquid was all but crystal clear. The head was a thin and tan. What head was present hung around for most the time I spent consuming my Pliny the Younger. When it finally did recede it left a very thin tan collar. After each sip a few tight tan bubbles would cling randomly to the side of the glass.
Full Disclosure Note: Before proceeding with the rest of my review I must come clean and state that this is my first sour beer review. Not a bad one to start with, I guess.
The initial aroma was a huge hit of sour. My first impression of this aroma was red wine vinegar. After taking several more deep breaths over the liquid, I began to become accustomed to the sour notes and began to pick up several more complexities in the aroma. Grapes and sour cherries came through next. A musty, funkiness characteristic came through on the finish. 
I must admit, as with the nose, I did not appreciate my initial taste. Very strong acidic nature, more like balsamic vinegar that the red wine vinegar from the nose. I said to those at the table with me, that this would go well with some olive oil and garlic and would make a nice salad dressing (quite honestly, this may be true, albeit it a waste). After growing accustomed to the sourness, as with the nose, I become to pick out quite a bit more complexity. There were some woodsy, oaky notes, as well as the grapes and sour cherries from the nose. The funkiness is prevalent middle to end. There is no hops to be found here. The finish is sour and dry. 
This beverage has a medium body and a light but tingly effervescence for carbonation. Overall, it is very dry and astringent. The finish leaves the pallet dry and jowls drawn in from the astringency.
I would have to say that sour beers are an acquired taste and I have not yet fully acquired it. This was drinkable, I suppose. If it wasn't kicked in 70 minutes, I might have ordered another to assist my palate in the acquisition.

4.34/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5On tap at RR - still have two bottles aging at home. Looking forward to that opening ceremony.
Appearance - Reddish brown, mahogany, with a minor off white head - very little retention or lacing, but the brew itself looks mighty inviting.
Smell - Ripe cherries, dark wine, strong fruit smells with a little bit of sparkling wine.
Taste - Very dark ale with champagne aftertaste - cherry, lambic sourness, but not overpowering because it is balanced well by cabernet highlights.
Mouthfeel - Slight carbonation tingle but still retains the attractive dark ale smoothness.
Drinkability - More of a treat than a session beer, but don't pass this one up if you can get it on tap, or aged for 1+ years. 701 charactersraoulduke37, Mar 30, 2009
4.43/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 750mL bottle, batch 001X4, into a tulip. Poured almost like cola, a nice dark fizzy reddish brown. Head is almost nonexistent, as it really just fizzed out relatively quickly. Carbonation is insane; even with no head I can actually hear it fizzing away in the tulip glass.
Smells how it looks, of dark cherries, raisins, and other sour dark reddish colored fruits. An afterscent of champagne or sparkling wine is unsurprisingly evident.
Taste is very very tart. I knew this was a sour, but did not know it would be quite this pronounced. The dark black cherry taste definitely shines through, with an aftertaste of dates or figs. Reminiscent of a dry sparkling cabernet.
Mouthfeel is pretty awesome; the bottle-conditioned carbonation definitely lends the beer a light body with a nice astringency at the end.
Drinkability is definitely there. It's so similar to sparkling wine or champagne, it's a sipper for sure. The tartness really is a curveball, and I'm not quite sure how much of this I could drink without my tastebuds shriveling up and dying on me, but it's definitely refreshing. At 10%ABV though, I can't see myself drinking too much of this without having a wicked headache later in the night or the next morning.
Overall, definitely an amazing brew that everyone should try. Not something I can see myself drinking regularly, but more like a celebration brew to break out on special occasions. I'm definitely interested in cellaring this and trying it a couple years down the line. 1,513 charactersahpark, Mar 30, 2009

A - Clear cola-colored, purple tinted body with one-finger off-white head that retained like a champ for quite a while, then reduced to a thin veil. 
S - Nose suggests sour grapes, funky Brett notes, oak tannins, and an astringent, magic marker-esque aspect. Not as over-the-top as I was expecting. 
T - Flavor is wine-like, with plenty of oaky/woody notes. While there is no noticeable hop presence, there is tons of funky Brett flavor and sour fruit notes. 
M - Medium body with a dry mouthfeel and finish. Warm and slightly astringent on the palate with a mild alcohol sting. 
D - Quite drinkable for one of the most coveted American-made sour ales in beer-lure. While this is a Brett-head's dream, I actually found it to be not as harsh as I was anticipating. Really glad to have had the opportunity to get this on tap outside of Cali. 876 charactersffejherb, Mar 29, 2009
3.96/5  rDev -10.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4This beer pours a lovely cola brown that turns into a dark cherry when held to the light. The head is a narrow collar of white. This is really a lovely beer.
Smells of tart and sour funk with cranberry, currants and strawberry. There's a spicy, almost floral sting behind this too that seems a bit like alcohol, but it blends too closely to the tartness to tell. Deep beneath is a very mild prune and raisin which adds a lot of depth and balance. 
Tastes dry and tart with a floral touch of cork and crisp dry green pepper that dries the tongue. There's a sweetness up front that delivers under-ripe strawberry and gooseberries. The carbonation seems to lift the dryness off the tongue with the sweet fruitiness seemingly hiding underneath. The CO2 sting almost makes this almost minty.
Feels quite frothy and wild, perhaps a little over done. The carbonation also seems to mess with the flavor in a distracting sort of way. I get the impression that I'm missing some of the flavor due to the wild carbonation.
Over all I thought this was quite tasty, but not as impressive than other wild ales, especially those offered by RR. The big downfall for me was the carbonation. Maybe I should just swirl my glass for a few minutes? 1,230 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Mar 29, 2009

Dark cherry red pour with a hazy tan head that lingers. Very sour aroma of cherries and plums with a light vinous smell to it as well. The flavor is like a sour fruit explosion in your face: cherries, grapes, blackberries, and a nice wine thickness. Very nice carbonation in the mouth and a nice malt profile as well. Hopefully my future experiences with sours will match up to this one. 499 charactersWackyfoot, Mar 25, 2009

Smell: Rich, expressive aroma smelling of macerated fruit, oak wood, red wine vinegar, lactic acid, tobacco, and even vanilla. Hubba-hubba!
Taste: Malts mingled with gooey black cherry fruit preserves and some prominent, vinous red wine qualities all with a bundle of lactic sourness to coat the tongue. Small pinch of vanilla sugar and fine aromatic tobacco. Non-obtrusive tannic oak component. Long finish with some lingering tart, earthy hints and final pops of acidity.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-high, lively carbonation.
Drinkability: It's hard not to gulp this one down like a madman. All in all, this is one excellent beer layered with rich complexities and one that I cheerfully recommend. 791 charactersChainGangGuy, Mar 24, 2009

Appearance: Pours dark red, with quite a bit of carbonation. Large head fades quickly to almost none.
Smell: Definitely sour, smells a bit like maraschino cherries (real ones, not the bright red sugar bombs). Dark fruit with just a hint of nuttiness.
Taste: It is always a bit of a challenge for me describing sour beers - but this has all the flavors I like to see. Definitely a bit puckering, plenty of sourness without being overpowering. Dark fruit flavors, mainly cherry. 
Overall impression: Another great wild offering from Russian River. It is amazing that we can get these in Colorado now - the CO beer scene just keeps getting better! 771 charactersrowew, Mar 24, 2009

Smooth, slightly carbonated mouthfeel. The taste really follows through on the aroma. Vinuous, red-wine overtone with tart cherries and the funky yeast flow throughout the beer.

The smells are VERY intense! Lots of red wine and grapes mixed with sour citrus, spicy yeast. sweet red berries, oak, and a hint of smoke. Pretty much one of the best smelling beers of all time.
While the scent builds this one up, the taste luckily doesn't fall off much. Everything starts off sweet and fruity, but then the really sour flavors and spicy peppery yeast really kick in. The red wine flavors aren't as potent as the smell let on, but they're certainly still there. It's a sipper, but you'll want more and more.
I split a bottle and I wish I had more right away...however at $18 per bottle, this is a special occasion brew for the moment.
One of RR's best beers that's up there with their hop monsters.
If you like sours, have a passing interest in wine, or genuinely just want to try something unique - this is it. Funny, enough, the GABF samples of this beer were even better. I look forward to future batches.
EDIT: While the nose/taste seem to be the same, a recent bottle of this proved to be much lighter in color. While previous versions looked almost like a red wine, this one was a much paler beer with maroon highlighting things. Not really a problem, but just worth noting. 1,308 charactersDomingo, Mar 22, 2009

Frenzied carbonation feeds the head. Then a truly unique phenomenon begins to unveil itself . . . the beer begins to make crackling sounds just like a bowl of rice krispies! The head holds along with the crackling sounds for a couple of minutes but then quickly vanishes once I start drinking. The appearance and sounds of this beer was quite an amazing experience . . . never felt like a beer was as alive as this one. Beer is a gorgeous dark burgundy color as well. The color especially the crackle make this a 5 for me. Smell of dark fruit, cherries, apples, brett, and a little vinegar. Initial taste is sour and tart but then it is balanced out quickly by some malts. Beer is tremendously complex. The finish is long lasting and leaves you longing for more with the cabernet sauvignon grapes lingering . ..very nice. Moutfeel is tantalizing as the beer dances across your tongue and feels as alive as it did when it was first poured. I really enjoyed this beer but could probably handle no more than 2. A lot of hype with this beer and I'll say, for the most part, it lived up to it IMO. I'm aging a couple of other bottles and I imagine they will improve quite a bit. Will revisit in a couple years. 1,303 charactersNick3, Mar 22, 2009

Pours a dark cola Burgundy into a Snifter, carbonation is clearly scene but not overwhelmingly. Minimal head retention with a small but nice amount of lace. The aromas coming form the beer are very complex, black currants, cherry's and Tobacco every so slightly. Was a mind opening taste for everyone at the tasting and actually for a couple people their first addiction. Taste is a sour that leaves your mouth a bit dry. Flavors of cherry's were dominate for me not others, with black currants and a hint of oak in the back ground. I am not a big fan of sours but this beer did well for being a sour and converted people in the tasting to sour lovers. Mouth feel is like drinking a very dry and tart wine and I wouldn't be surprised if some was used int he brewing. This type of beer is definitely a slow and sip drink, at least for me.

Aromas of dark Belgian malts exhibiting brown sugar and tobacco accents. Cabernet and black currants combine in a great unity. Woody barrel accents weave in and out as Brett funk kicks in with mild sourness and a puff of alcohol. Deeply complex.
First sip brings semi sweet dark malts with a hint of earthy tobacco moving to dark berry / black currant and lush Cabernet wine flavors. Quite woody overall with oak barrel tannins rushing through. Acidic tones move in with Brett funk as it flows down and puckers with sourness in the mouth. Lingering tones of red wine and currants. Wow, just wow. Simply divine.
Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a crisp smoothness that runs throughout each sip. Good, steady carbonation throughout. A contemplative sipper of a beer...let it meander it's way across your palate with each sip to get as many as the nuances as possible. Complex, tasty and a masterpiece of the brewing and barrel aging art. Chalk this up to one of my favorite Russian River creations yet! 1,106 charactersorbitalr0x, Mar 17, 2009

Nose is perhaps the weakest point of the beer, but still hints of funk, wood, dark fruit. Flavor is amazing. Complex, integrated, beautifully balanced.

4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had this at RR but more recently on tap at Local 44.
a - reddish hue, not much head, whispy. It's not completely opaque but it is dark.
s - sour. The great type of sour from RR. A bit acid, a bit sulfur, a bit "hairy"
t - wow. It's sour, not hugely sour, but assertively sour. There are a lot of wine characteristics in this one, tannin, grape type flavors. It's delicously balanced and very enjoyable. It's not too sour to keep drinking.
m - pretty high carbonation, sour isn't quite puckering but it's close.
d - pretty high, I could drink several but acid reflux would probably kick in. It's a bit pricy to be very drinkable though ;) 644 charactersjojox, Mar 16, 2009
3.81/5  rDev -13.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3On tap at the Local 44 in Philly yesterday.
The beer pours a darkish brown color with minimal head retention and fair lacing. The nose on this beer is its best feature, IMHO, with a complex aroma of black currents, wine, vanilla and sour funk. On the palate... sigh... this beer is just over the top sour for me. I get a hint of wine and black currents, along with some light vanilla, but the overwhelming flavor component to this beer is sour funk. There is an intense vinegar/sour wine flavor to this beer, with a huge rush of sour in the finish. My tolerance and appreciation for sour beers has improved over the past year, but I just think the brett in this beer is over the top, with the sour overwhelming and dominating everything else. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a long finish, and the alcohol is very well hidden. However, the excessive sour component really wore me out in the end, and IMHO it really hurts this beer's drinkability.
Glad I had a chance to try this one, but once was enough for me. 1,013 charactersJohn_M, Mar 16, 2009

A: Rich mahogany color body with a shimmering silkiness to it... solid khaki colored head, which receded to a nice cap which last throughout... some lacing lingers
S: Sweet, sour, tart. Its all there... Dried red fuits (think plums, grapes, various berries)... sour cherries... earthy leathery brett goodness
T: Cherries are the overwhelming characteristic. Nice sour and tart combinations of the fruits. Clearly aged in cabernet, there is a strong dense tannic characteristics and even a hint of pepper. Brett and bacteria are clearly present in a hearty but refined showing.
M: Almost like a sparkling juice that has sat out for an hour. Still some carbonation, but not out of control.
D: Super duper.
This remind me a lot of supplication with the most noticeable difference for me being the different wine barrels the two beers are aged in. I like what the cab does to amp this beer up. You know, I wish an east coast brewer made some sours of this caliber... that way I wouldn't have to either pay an arm and a leg or wait months to find them. 1,121 characterscallmemickey, Mar 16, 2009

Smells lilke wine and vinegar.
A very strong and intense sour flavor even for a style where strong flavor is to be expected and valued. There is a high level of carbonation. Cough syrup start then finishes with hints of sour yogurt.Tastes like fizzy balsamic vinegar.
I have tried a number of these beers in the last year or two but this one is in a league of it's own. If you like sour, go for it but if you are not devoted to this style try something less intense. I couldn't finish it. 590 charactersjsapunor, Mar 15, 2009

Only two years later this beer is no longer aged for 9 months and (try half the time) and also no longer has the depth of flavor and character I used to find in it. Still good but The spicy chocolate notes which I used to enjoy (in the background) no longer show up... It is now highly acidic (as it was) and not too much more...
03-15-2009...
Picked this one up without fully knowing what I was getting myself into. Im still not real sure what the story on the beer is but it is suffice to say that this is very rare. It better be at $20 for a 750ml.
This beer pours a deep cherrywood color, and has an offwhite colored head. It has tightly concentrated bubbles, and good head retention.
The aroma pours out of the nose of the bottle as soon as you pop the cork. Sour cherry, and red fruit overwhelm but some spice notes get through as well.
This stuff is very intense it has a very tightly concentrated sour flavor that will take you by surprise if your not ready for it. Very sour up front, and then the flavor spreads out a bit. The 10 ABV is completely hidden by red fruit and spice. After sipping it for a while, your mouth adjusts to the intensity and if you like sour style beers this will do the trick. I wonder how it will age, I feel that with some time the beer will mellow out some and perhaps be more approachable. All things considered, this one is very unique and worth the 20 bones. 1,420 charactersflannelman808, Mar 15, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750 ML into a tulip
P: Golden brown from the bottle, and sits a crimson-soaked plum in the glass. The tall head is light tan, loose and frothy with bubbles frolicking happily about for what seemed like an eternity! It finally sank to form a thick cap on the surface. Looks very good!
A: Deliciously powerful aroma that could clear even the most congested nasal passages. Cherries, cranberries, plums, and grapes are all here. Also, I can definitely smell the Cabernet in there along with that pungeant barnyard funk. 
T: Wow! Tart cherries from the jump just explode onto the scene along with dried cranberries, juicy raspberries, and green apple skins that lend their sourness in tongue-puckering fashion. Plums and grapes lay underneath for some sweet fruitiness that provides a nice contrast to the sourness. That beautiful Brett funkiness hits hard in the middle, lending a flavor that reminds me of pungeant cheese. Alcohol is undetectable in ethanol form, but the cabernet flavors add to an already great profile. Awesome!
M & D: Consecration sports a medium-light body that feels like champagne. Nice prickly bubbles dance on the tongue from the rather high carbonation. Drinkability is good as I really enjoyed every drop of this bottle, but I couldn't have another. This one deserves to be savored!
Notes: Damn! This is one hell of a ride! Very fruity, very sour, very funky, very intoxicating, and very good. Another perfect example of why people go ape-shit over Vinnie's concoctions. If you love sours, you owe it to yourself to get a hold of this one! Highly recommended 1,588 characterssweetbrew82, Mar 13, 2009

Poured into a medium sized tulip glass.
Small head that disappeared quickly
The color was like a golden red, it looked heavenly.
The smell is remarkable! One of the most complex smells of any beer I have tried. It smelled like a fine cabernet sauvignon wine. Slightly sour, currants.
The flavor explodes the second it hits your lips! Such a remarkable complicated flavor,.. but in a good way. Tastes like a rich wed wine, sour, fruity, slight hints of vanilla.
Someone else reviewing this beer said that it has champagne like carbonation, I think that is pretty accurate. A little wetter though.
Extremely drinkable! I would not mind drinking on this year around. Every sip is fulfilling and rewarding. Complete perfection.
If you are lucky enough to get your hands on this you will not be dissapointed 842 characterspaulxqx, Mar 12, 2009

Let it warm a little in the 750 ml and finally popped the top, went in for a sniff and was met by foam slowly pouring out and directly into the nostril and some on the floor. If I didn't have four more bottles I would have been pissed.
Pours a beautiful burgundy red and also a little brown with a nice small ring of foam around the snifter.
A slight vinegar aroma with whiffs of cherry as well. Currants are also present. Awesome!
Whoa! The taste is something I have never experienced before. Off the first sip I have a brain explosion of different things. There are so many things going on with this beer that it is hard to express. I taste subtle vinegar, cherries and a lil ol school funk. There is a slight acidity on the swallow but not unpleasant in the slightest. Very complex but amazing! It makes my mouth water at the finish...almost making me want to drink more to satisfy the craving. I oblige.
The drinkability for me is very high as the alcohol hides well in this beer for a 10%er.
Awesome, amazing beer that everyone should try at least once for the experience. This beer deserves the praises and ratings it has received. Very well done from one of my favorite Nor Cal breweries. 1,246 characterskaseydad, Mar 12, 2009
4.26/5  rDev -3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Don't know where to start, other than: holy cow this is a heck of a beer! Beautiful brick red--and though not fined or filtered to my understanding, certainly was quite clear. TONS of red fruit in this one, and I keep coming back to cranberry in both the nose and mouth. Nice and tart, no perception of alcohol, phenomenal bacteria cultures smelling of heaven for wild freaks like me. Extremely tight and very present carbonation--champagne like in character, and probably a function of slow, cool fermentation at the hands of a master craftsman. CO2 tightness could trick you into tasting mineral content in this one. But that's about the only wine reference I'd make: there really isn't cab character here, and the only fruit I get is coming from that added by the brewer and not from grapes. Moreover, the mouthfeel is very much so a light sparkler and not a muscular cab or tannic or hoppy brew. And this is a good thing! Nor is there overwhelming oak: the barrels were either neutral or only lightly toasted, or washed. Either way, big thumbs up for selecting barrels that let the beer shine. It's clearly paying to come from a family of winemakers and have friends in the biz (both for barrel sources and experience with oak).
More recent bottles indicate some signs of wine oxidation/stewed fruit. Nevertheless, if you consider yourself a sour fiend and enjoy fruited ales, do yourself a favor and seek this one out. Killer beer! 1,437 charactersjwjon1, Mar 12, 2009

T- Tart cherries, sour patch kids, mold, oaky finish compared to batch 1.
M- Crisp and Clean.
D- IF you like sours this 10% beauty will bathe you in joy and happiness. It makes me smile.
Images of Friar Tuck and RobinHood flow from the glass. Just think of making a sour mead between battles with the sheriff of Nottingham. Arrows and barrels everywhere, the beer conjurs such strong emotion response.
Let us fight a revolution for the Hop Nation.

A- A beautiful almost totally opaque amber. Very hard to see through unless right next to a light. 
S- Richly textured plums and currants; the Cabernet comes through very strongly. Like smelling a fruity, carbonated Cab. 
T - Ahhh. Wow. Sour currants, some dark cherry, and maybe hints of plum. Perfectly balanced.
M/D- Really solid - the carbonation matches very well. Light, crisp feel that seems like a combination between a fine Cab Sav and a fantastic beer. I could drink this all day.... try it with some Jalapeno jack cheese. 576 characterszminor, Mar 10, 2009

S- There really isn't much of a smell, but there is a slight metallic smell, with a bit of a slight acid smell. 
T- This is where the magic happens. Very tasty, loads of sour cherry, with a touch of the currants. As this warms up its more of a sour Cabernet Sovereign. For me the sourness is tasty and mostly cherry.
M- Great feeling mouthfeel, good amount of carbination, not too much but just exactly what you would want. 
D- Very easy to drink, almost too drinkable. But after 3 6oz glasses it does start to get a bit heavy in your stomach, but it is still tasty to say the least and super drinkable for 10%. 718 charactersWetpaperbag, Mar 10, 2009

A. Had a reddish brown color to it with a thin head that reseeded quickly. No lacing. 
S. Sour smell with red wine hints and currants
T. This was my first ever sour and its quite amazing, I must say. This definitely got better as it warmed. Just an explosion of red grapes, sour notes and wood notes. Very complex. 
MF. Champagne like carbonation to it. 
D. This is a highly drinkable beer, can hardly even taste the alcohol. This was an amazing beer for me, definitely gonna be looking for many more sours now. Well worth the 23 dollar price tag. 683 charactersSilenus89, Mar 10, 2009
4.89/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours from caged and corked 750 ML bottle(Batch 001X2) a clear amber brown with a very spritzy head of foam. When it's spritzy, I know it's not going to last very long and it didn't. The bubbles surfacing to the top are keeping a small island afloat, so to speak. Hehe..the foam reminds me of pixels on a computer screen...
The smell is just as I remember from the samples I had at last year's GABF...Cabernet Sauvignon notes dominate with big notes of vanilla and oak and fruit that *is* currants. I love red currants on buttered toast and the smell here totally reminds me of that. 
The taste is deliciously both sweet and tart up front. Maybe a bit more intense than I remember from the 1 oz samples but hey, I love that it is and I love the fact that I now have 25.4 oz, give or take a few as I've just taken a few sips, to take my time with and savour. The foam is now gone but I can still see the lively carbonation throwing up....errr...tossing...err..the bubbles are still making their way to the top nearly smack damn in the center of the glass. 
Back to the taste. I'm now getting a pretty big kick from the Brett(sorry, I have a hard time spelling it out) and I'd be amiss if I didn't say there's a fair amount of caramel malt here, hence my first sentance on taste. Gee wiz this is so damn tasty and there's so much going on with the flavours, I can't describe them all properly.
Medium mouthfeel and pretty high carbonation, a plus in my book, it finishes with big sour and Brett notes. Wonderful!
Drinkability? 10%abv and I cannot taste it or feel it during or after the swallow. No warming for me at all but I *know* that when I finish this big bottle, I'll feel that all is right with the world, if that makes any sense. ;^)
Bottom line: A superb! American Wild Ale that I fell in love with from my very first sip. A must try for anyone who favours the style!
Finally..a big Thank You goes out to The Wine Underground in Englewood CO for making this available online! 1,989 charactersBitterbill, Mar 08, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My folks brought this back from their "Wine" tour in norther CA along with a few select beers.
Uncorked a 750 ml bottle with my bro-in-law over the weekend and decanted the brew into a couple of oversize wine glasses. It pours a ruby brown and is capped by a finger of off white head that dissipates to a subtle ring. Nose immediately reminds me of beers like The Dissident. Sour, fruity twinges pop up each nostril just daring for another whiff. Aromas are however, a bit milder than some other, almost overpowering sour ales. 
Flavor is tart, sour, fruity, acidic, oaky and altogether complex. Besides being a big sour ale, the flavors are a bit difficult to describe and really require an individual palate test. Mouthfeel is medium and supported by some fine carbonation. Overall this is an outstanding beer that masks it 10% ABV. It would go well with some tender hoofed wild game. 888 charactersSickBrew, Mar 08, 2009
4.89/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle (batch 001X3) poured into my large St. Feullien goblet (I was gonna go with one of the Russian River glasses, but they're all pretty ugly and none of them have the nucleation etching like this one), Consecration is a brilliant ruby with an off-white head that is pretty quick to settle to a thick skim, leaving light lace. 
Smell is vinous, tart dark berries, caramel, not overly rich, even at cellar temp, but very nice. The constant crackle keeps it lively and enticing without overwhelming. 
Taste is very nice. Immediately it reminds me of Oerbier Special Reserve, probably my favorite beer of all time. Which makes it all the harder for me to overlook that fact that I buy that for few less dollars for an equal volume, and that it comes from drastically further distance from a brewery that ages it for at least an extra year or so before release. Still, value is not a factor in taste, and on that accord there are very few that pale. Like most Flanders style beers, especially the stronger ones, I really wish I'd had this with the massive rib eye au poivre I had earlier, rather then splitting the Shiraz with my wife. Consecration is more overtly fruity (then the De Dolle), and is not that funky, although it's obviously pretty young, but is nevertheless fantastic. 
Mouthfeel is medium light, a crisp creamy carbontion, with just enough maltiness to keep it from being to thin. Very digestible, and the coating of the tannins on the mouth is pleasant and really ties in the wine barrel aging. 
Drinkability is high, as this is about as good as it gets for me taste wise. My only ding is the cost, in that comparable beers in it's class (the aforementioned De Dolle, Rodenbach Grand Cru, Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien, etc...) are quite a bit less, and they all come from another continent, not a days drive south of me. Still, this is a masterful beer that I'm glad to see will be somewhat regularly available, demanding a high proportion of my beer budget until they ramp up and price down! In fact, the more I contemplate this beer, the more impressed I am, perhaps one of the best I've ever had - again, only the De Dolle being on par. Wow, this beer is just an incredible mind blower. As I worked though it, I had to bump it up to a 5, in spite of the price, because it was just so dang good, in spite of the young age!
Edit - I had to pop an 06 Oerbier Special Reserve to compare with the last glass of the Consecration, these notes are all from the perspective of the De Dolle:
a-much larger head, more lace, duller, murky body
s-much drier, more mineral, bright
t-less complexity, more (very clean) alcohol, less depth, more wood, less tannins. RR is fruitier, DD is earthier, and has less depth. 
m-a bit less carbonation but still hanging strong, lighter, drier. 
d-good, but I'm shocked to see I prefer the RR in the shootout. The oakiness is a bit much, it hasn't gotten overly funky like I'd hope with the age, and the depth doesn't match the RR. I like a sweeter beer, or more sour, but the aged DD reminds me of the disappointing 05 Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien I had on xmas eve, which was also over oaked and not that sour. 3,163 charactersccrida, Mar 08, 2009

Poured into a tulip glass. Root beer color with a deep amber tinge. Dark but mostly clear. Nice beige head fizzles out due to the acidity. Aroma is sour raisins and currants with a striking cabernet character that blends into the overall profile better than any other wine barrel-aged beer I've had. A brown sugar note emerges once my nose acclimates to the acidity of the aroma. Maybe even a little bourbon and light alcohol too. Very complex smell. Flavors of jammy wine, berries, raisins, oak, vinegar, brown sugar, and a bunch more I can't even articulate. Definitely improves as it warms up. Ridiculous complexity all around. Mouthfeel is rich and well carbonated with delicate bubbles. A joy to drink. RR just can't miss. 741 charactersillidurit, Mar 07, 2009

Cork removed with a good pop, which let some mist out of the bottle along with scents of fruits.
A: Poured into an oversized tulip wine glass. Beer is amber/brown, with reddish highlights. High clarity. Khaki head dissipates quickly, no lacing stays on glass as beer disappears. 
S: Initial smell was that of cherries. More sour than sweet most of the time. Lots of oak with just a touch of funk. As the beer opens up and warms 20 minutes later, more aromas of sweetness are present. My final glass from the bottle smelled even better with cabernet scents surfacing. Bottle says currants were used in this beer. I have never had currants knowingly, but I'm guessing there like cherries. Overall, impressive.
T: Sour cherries dominate, oak is present throughout. The cherries/ currants are sour most of the time, but the sweetness is almost there, almost noticeable, but never really makes its way completely. Beer is perfectly tart and acidic, Alcohol is hidden well. Long finish for a beer. Is this beer still?, or a beer wine hybrid. Lots of complexity and layers to this beer, which got better over the course of the bottle. Amazing.
M: High carbonation which contributed to a thicker body and mouthfeel. I enjoyed the amount of carbonation in this one. Clean finish.
D: Consecration is an amazing beer. Highly drinkable. I can not wait to have another bottle of this stuff, and see how it evolves with some cellaring. 1,439 characterssteadydose, Mar 06, 2009
4.43/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Color is similar to that of a red wine, although not as dark. When held up to a light source, you can definitely notice the clarity but it's a fairly dark beer otherwise. Very effervescent! Lots of little bubbles rushing to the surface. A slow, gentle pour yielded a nice 1 finger nutty tan head that resembled champagne bubbles more than beer, quickly appearing and fading almost as suddenly. Thin layer of patchy foam remains on the surface.
Smell: Right up front you get the whiff of that Cabernet mixed with a mildly tart fruitiness. There's a mild alcoholic nip to it, but not surprising for a 10% ale. Slightly phenolic. Brett funk.
Taste: I really love this beer. There's definitely the flavor and feel of a Cabernet wine at the forefront of every sip, acidic and dry, yet tart and fruity from the added currents. This just gets better after every sip!
Mouthfeel: Starts off bubbly and pricky, and then slightly dry and acidic, but finishes off rather nicely with a sweeter fruity kick. Very good, and probably one of the more complex beers for the mouth to experience.
Drinkability: I can't really tell there's any alcohol in this. It's 10% but you wouldn't know it. It's definitely a pleasure to drink and one of the few Wild Ales I've had the opportunity to try - the other being Ommegeddon (which I rated B+) 1,335 charactersjulian, Mar 05, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Got this one from Joey and goodspeed94, thanks a ton gents!
750 ml cork and caged bottle poured into a tulip glass. Batch 001X4.
Pours a deep dark almost blood red with a quick (and quite loud) bubbly two finger light khaki colored head that falls to a thin pillowy layer of foam that lasts throughout. Virtually nothing in terms of lacing, a bit of a disappointment there. Aroma is heavenly; tart fruits, wet tobacco leaves, and rhubarb. Underneath the funk is a touch of chocolate and oak with some dark grapes and fig as well. Taste begins with some leafy greens, dates, and brett. Midway a bit of alcohol comes to the surface with a woody oak flavor and some vinegar. Aftertaste is where the sweetness lingers; bitter cocoa nibs, dark berries, and leather. Just a complex orgasm for the tongue, mmmhmmm. Pretty light and fluffy for a beer at 10% abv, I'm blown away. Lively, puckering carbonation, just a perfect feel in the mouth. Just a wonderful beer. Still no Deviation, but another sour from Russian River that definitely needs to be experienced by all. 1,064 charactersBeerTruth, Mar 05, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5There are few beers that served as 'eye-openers' for me, that is, they forever turned me on to the style and helped me realize what they were capable of being. Stone IPA, The Elder, and Stone IRS are all examples. Consecration joined this list several months ago, as it was the first wild ale that really caught my attention.
The color is deep ruby-red, with a short-lasting off-white head. I'm working from notes at the moment, but I'm inclined to say the Consecration I've had many times on tap appeared to be a deeper red, almost opaque. I only recently had the opportunity to try it from the bottle, and it appeared a bit more translucent than what I remember having on tap. No lacing remains as the Consecration quickly disappears.
The nose is tart berries, wine, and pure funk. 
Consecration is a shock if you are new to the style, so don't try to win any craft beer converts with this one. Huge tartness from the currants are the first thing that hits you, followed by citrus, sweetness, and dark fruits, followed by a sour but clean finish. 
Body is medium to full, with the on-draft variety seeming slightly fuller-bodied. Alcohol is present but very well muted for such a huge beer. Carbonation is well-balanced, and the finish is wonderfully clean. Drinkability is through the roof, especially if you're accustomed to the style.
At a recent tasting, I remember a friend's 60+ year-old father continually commenting 'this isn't what beer should taste like' after sampling Consecration for the first time. Not in a mean-spirited or angry manner, but in a rather shocked and confused way. It certainly is different, and far-removed from what most beer drinkers envision beer to be. 
The best comparison I can think of is when a person tries something very sour for the first time, for example, a sour candy. Sweetness is expected, but this is the complete opposite! Shocked and slightly turned off, the candy is immediately removed from the mouth. Some time later you found that you actually enjoyed the variation in flavor and the effects it had on your tastebuds. 
It's an oversimplification, but it illustrates how sours must be approached. There's a wealth of complexity hidden in them, one that you'll hopefully find just as exciting to explore as any other big beer.
Don't miss this one. As I've said before, Consecration is to wild ales what the Younger is to Imperial IPAs. If sours weren't so darn polarizing, this would undoubtedly be on the top 10. 2,476 charactersThirdLap, Mar 04, 2009

Deep garnet color, small beige head, thick drippy rings of lace.
Aroma of sour fruit, earth and leaves like a wet forest floor, and some caramel. Deep, complex, very attractive.
Tastes sour but not overwhelmingly so, with dark fruit and fruity caramel sweetness. Orange peel, black tea and wood join in. Some deep earthy complexity. Outstanding balance and combination of flavors. Eventually some moderate herbal bitterness emerges, and the sweetness fades. Long finish, dry, moderately bitter, moderately astringent, woody, and still somewhat fruity, in a way like raisins and plum skins.
The carbonation is a bit fizzy, but good smooth texture overall. Quite drinkable for what it is.
Great beer, very enjoyable. Little outright funk, but still complex and interesting. I'm looking forward to trying this with some age on it. 888 charactersBeerzebub, Mar 04, 2009

Pours a dark and bright amber/brown color with a nice solid off white head.
Aromas are of very bright fruits, almost a cranberry like character, sour, tart, and with a faint hint of vinegar. A little lighter than other Russian River sours I have tried, but still quite pleasant.
Taste and character come off on first sip as SUPER dry. Beer then settles into some bright fruit flavors, cherries, currants, and cranberries. Finish is very tart, crisp, and with a light wine like bite, and some nice cider vinegar sourness. The sourness is very nice, I really like how the fruit flavors dominate more than the sourness, which is more like an interesting backdrop. Dang... another top notch tasting sour from Russian River.
Wonderful mouthfeel, maybe a touch to dry. But still has a great full feel.
Drinkability is exceptional. If I didn't notice the bottle, I would have never guessed this beer pushes 10% ABV. It drinks more like a 6% or 7% beer. This is more of a refined sour, not like the big blast of sour you get from something like the Supplication and Beautification. It's like this one is better "put together". Wow... yet another super offering from Vinnie and crew. It's currently my #2 sour from them, Sanctification still wins by a nose though. 1,394 charactersflexabull, Mar 04, 2009

Pours a deep burgandy with a decent head.
Smells pretty lovely. Tart, cherries, mouth watering. Big time reminds me of New Glarus Belgian Red.
Then the taste. Still reminds me of the NGBR, but with an added sourness. Sour isn't blatantly up your ass like most, so it's actually enjoyable.
Alcohol is completely invisible and at 10% I would actually buy this again whereas most sours I wouldn't.
Overall: beats Temptation as my favorite sour to date 640 charactersPatronWizard, Mar 03, 2009

Pours a deep brown, has an apple cider effect with a fizzy head that evaps quickly. Its aged so it has that barrel smell with hints of fruits and leather. Big carbonation and champagne like feel
in the mouth. Tastes like champagne to me with apple and citrus notes. I enjoy drinking this as it is mellow and bubbly. Overall a decent beer that is worth the price to drink every once in a while. 473 charactersdapper, Mar 02, 2009

4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a SN Tulip Glass.
Appearance had a thin head that faded real quick down to nothing. No lacing either. Clear, ruby colored body.
Smell was of cherries, currants, slight oakiness and a nice Brett/Wild yeast funkiness.
Taste was amazing. Tart cherries and currant and a nice hint, but smoothing effect of barrel aging. A nice mellow funk/sourness from the Brett/Wild Yeasts. Smooth oakiness from the Cab barrels, alos lend a nice hint of tannins. Lots of tart, dark fruit flavors. Great sourness without being overpowering. More flavorful and complex as it warms up. A very slight sweetness shows in the middle of the drink.
Mouthfeel was of a medium body, well carbonated and crisp finish. Slight dryness.
Drinkability was good even though it is a sour. Very easy to drink and the flavors blend nicely, more-so as it warms up. Doesn't even hint at 10%.
This is by far one of my favorite sours as for as drinkability and flavor goes. 948 charactersriored4v, Feb 28, 2009

I'm not a fan of sours. So, why drink a sour? After all the hoopla I've seen about this beer, I had to see what everyone was talking about. 
I went into the shop to buy my allotted bottle of Consecration. To my surprise I saw it on their draft board. A perfect opportunity to try this RR beer.
A complex balance of a beer! It was sour but not overly so. The mouthfeel was full, rich, and complex. It warms as it goes (which I can still feel right now).
Worthy!
Edit: I went back on 3/5/09 and finished off that keg... (only a glass and 1/2 left in the keg). 587 charactersScreamForMe, Feb 28, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This one was enjoyed on tap at Catalyst in Fort Collins. I like to call this place the little Falling Rock up north. Younger in a week!
Served cold in a goblet glass filled to the brim. The small 1/2" of head wanes almost right away and leaves no lace. Bubbles continue to rise through to the top. It has a dark brown color with ruby highlights and good clarity from what I can tell.
Aroma is sweet and sour with a slight bit of red wine and oak from aging in cabernet barrels.
The taste is sour and tart but not overpowering. The one sour I'm really familiar is La Folie and the Consecration is not as puckingly sour. It is reminiscent of a good cabernet with those tannins hitting me in the back of the cheeks. The red wine flavors really work well with the sourness from the wild yeasts. Tart cherries, sour apples, raisins and spice are all in there. Oak is in the background but it's still noticeable.
Mouthfeel is full bodied and tannic, sour, and with a nice lower level of carbonation.
Drinkability is good but a bottle would have to be shared. The goblet I had today was the perfect serving size. It's definately warming and gets better as it warms too.
My only real knowledge of sours was with La Folie and I had mixed feelings. It seemed too sour and difficult to enjoy in larger servings (i.e. a full glass). Consecration has a more rounded balanced feel to it and I could enjoy the entire glass without feeling like it was a burden. It's expensive but certainly worth it for a special treat. 1,510 charactersGilGarp, Feb 28, 2009
4.79/5  rDev +8.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Catalyst. Sampled a murky rust colored red with not much in the way of carbonation. Some ruby red hues around the edges of the glass. Some minor viscous notes that was a bit of a surprise.
The nose comes out more as it warms. Some nice subtle notes that blended very nicely with every component. There was a light fruity note, that came across more like a tart cherry aroma than anything else. Some underlining citrus notes adds to that depth. Some lighter funk notes with some horse blanket and subtle almost bretty aromas. A mostly acidic but some underlining vinegar notes. Some yeast aromas, but overall just a really good mix of fruit, funk and sour.
The taste is amazing. I try to be more descript but this is really good. And it gets better as it warms. To start out there is a light malt taste upfront but is quickly replaced with a mix of a tart earthy cherry, like a bing cherry, and a sweet fig, currant taste. There is a nice acidic flavor that comes out nicely but balances really well. As it warms and as you palate adjusts to the sour, more funk and malt notes comes out. Some lighter chocolate and an almost Special B like malt flavor come out, but its just so subtle to the taste. Some funk notes come out too, with a light barn yard and spicy undertones. Some yeast notes as well. The sourness retains through the full taste and even as it warms. A mild sweetness in the finish that really enhances the fruitiness for a cleaner taste.
The body is closer to moderate than dry. Extremely clean for being so much on the ABV side. Carbonation is low but ok as it really lets all the different flavors come out. Just really impressed with the balance between fruit, funk and sourness. Overall a fantastic beer being so fresh 1,750 charactersOxymoron, Feb 27, 2009

Consecration pours a rich redwood color and holds a silky tan head. Excellent lace and retention. 
The nose is quite complex with spicy alcohols, funky farmyard yeast, tart currants, oak, bourbon, vanilla, cabernet grapes, and musty soil. 
The taste is a superbly balanced blend of cabernet, ripe grapes, sour currants, oak and an earthy funk. 
Body is refreshing yet full and a crisp carbonation enhances the vast variety of flavors. Nice dry finish. I could enjoy this ale any time. 565 charactersrye726, Feb 27, 2009

A: Pours an almost completely opaque shade of dull murky brown with undersaturated dark amber hues. Massive -- for a sour -- loose, cask-like light brown head fills the glass as beer gushes all over my god damn leather upholstery. The head quickly recedes to nothing but a faint ring.
S: Mildly sour vinous aromas. Currents are surprisingly detectable. Also substantive hints of the cabernet barrel, with a slight aromas of brown sugar or chocolate in the background. Aromas is much less intense than I would have imagined.
T: All the flavors of the nose mingle together. Flavors are not extremely sour, nor are they strongly reminiscent of vinegar, but acidic. The palate is flooded with muted vinous flavors that turn tangy and a tad dry near the finish. Sour-grape tinged alcohol burn can be felt long after certain sips. 
M: The feel is smooth, if only slightly hefty. Carbonation is certainly there and a bit tingly, but like every other quality in this beer, its subtle.
D: I'm not sure what to say about this beer right now. I think it could use some time in the cellar. I find myself longing for some of the funky brett aromas and flavors which never really materialize for me. Is this a world class brew? Certainly. But I would take a Cuvee de Castleton over it at this stage of ripeness. It absolutely pushes the envelope in blurring the lines between wine and beer. 1,393 characterskasper, Feb 27, 2009

I won so Josh brought this out. Little did we know that this beer would completely blow us into orbit. Poured into two unbranded tulip glasses.
A: This pours a hazy...very hazy...rusty/copper/ruby. This was a gusher. Serve cold or have a glass in hand. As this poured, a 1" bone colored head appeared. The head dropped faster than a girl's dress on prom night and left a thin skim of bone colored head. The carbonation in this beer is unreal, as the beads just flow up the glass.
S: Wowoweewah. The smell is exceptional. Not completely in-your-face, but all the necessary ingredients are there. Tons of Cabernet soaked lemons with a nice Brett and Oak undertone. Cabernet soaked white and red grapes also come through in the nose.
T: This is just unreal. I basically screamed "WOW" as this beer touched my lips. The sweet, Cabernet soaked lemons and ripe red grapes just exploded with juices and flavors. The strange thing about this beer is that it started sweet with sweet grapes and lemon, but then morphed into a dry, Brett-driven monster than finished it through. This beer was unreal and definitely one of the best sours I have ever had.
Overall, this beer was glorious. The mouthfeel was highly carbonated and perfect. The 10ABV was absolutely nowhere to be found. And I am glad I do not live on the West Coast for once, otherwise I would spend my whole life savings on this beer. 1,502 characterstreyrab, Feb 27, 2009

Wonderful deep and dark brown with some light reddish touches around the sides and the bottom of the glass. A nice and foamy brown head rose up to a height of around two inches before dropping down to about half and then hanging around the rest of the session with deep and thoroughly coating side glass lace, this one was perfect.
The aroma was wonderful, previously poster arrived atthe word fuck to describe and I would have to agree here. Rich sour notes, sweet and tart cherries dropped in with light oak notes as it warmed, but dominted by the deep sour and cherry notes. Such a wonderful balance here between the sour notes and the rich underlying fruit flavor. Some nice dark malts as it starts to warm, but the long drawn out sour flavor comes back and dries out the palate and really pushes the flavor to the next level. What ten percent, this one drank like it was at four percent, it was just that damn good.
Overall I was totally floored by this one. One of the best beers, easily a top three to five I have ever had. It was perfectly blended and just really ungodly drinkable. I cannot say anything else, instead I will sit back and simply enjoy this one again. 1,336 charactersmikesgroove, Feb 27, 2009

A: Poured a reddish-brown hue (similar to prune juice) with a big white head that dissipated rather quickly. 
S: Currents, cherry and perhaps grapes. 
T: Tart right off the bat, which is then slowly balanced out by the cheery/raspberry like flavor profile. Very sugary in the sense, almost like a sour sweet tart, that could also be best compared to a good champage or carbonated wine. 
M: A nice medium-body beer that is nicely carbonated.
D: One of the best sours I've had the chance to try, with the alcohol nearly invisible.

Big currant and grape flavor, leather, and oak. Quite tart and dry on the tongue. Lemon in the finish. A little better once it warms up. Some bitter citrus flavors in the end, a little nutty and toast in the aftertaste.

4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance is good. It's not the most appealing color, sort of a murky brown cola color with hints of red. When held to the light it looks like dark cranberry juice. Head was quite lively on the pour into my snifter. I got about 4 finger widths somewhat on accident. I let it mellow down and it smoothed out into smaller bubbles, a thin rim hangs around, off white in color. Some trails of lacing here and there but usually dissolves off after some time.
The aroma is the highlight for me. Lots of dark fruits including cherries, raspberries, red grapes, and some balsamic vinegar. Plenty of depth here.
It's always weird having the first few sips of a new sour not knowing what to expect. I haven't had a sour in almost a year, so it really made my mouth pucker bigtime. After the initial shock wears off and the bubbles thin out a bit, it becomes a lot easier to enjoy. I actually thought I was going to give taste like a 3.5 until I became more used to it and the flavor profile started opening up beyond the sourness/acidity. 
Beginning of the sip tastes like grape juice, sweet and fairly wet, then quickly turns into cranberry followed by cherries and raspberries. The acidity follows, stemming from the cranberries and finally hitting a background chocolate note that is behind balsamic vinegar. This part of the sip takes the most getting used to for this Flanders Reddish type of style. Finishes up dry and sour with some red wine tones. 
Drinks well for 10%, can't taste the alcohol, too much else going on. Doesn't really warm on the way down either. It's very sour though so it demands drinking it pretty slow. Really enjoyable though to sip on all night. The warmer it gets and the more acclimated your tongue gets, the more enjoyable it becomes. 1,763 charactersBubba83, Feb 25, 2009

A: A great cross between a wine and a beer. It's a ruby red like a Cab but has the transparency of a beer. No head
S: Tart cherries, oak and Wine. I thought it was just oak-aged but the brewery says aged in Cabrenet barrels. You can tell and I loved it!
T: From the first sip I feel in love with this beer. The tartness of the cherries reminds me of the Belgian Red from N.G. but that's where it ends. Then it transitions to an interesting wild ale taste that totally works. I get a lot of wine sharpness in the finish and man it's fantastic!
The mouthfeel and drinkability speak for themselves. I would happily drink these till I couldn't see anymore and damn near did! This was there best beer in my opinion! Other than the price there is nothinhg wrong with this beer in my opinion! One of the best beers (better than Abyss and KBS) I've ever had! 916 charactersmadtowndmb1, Feb 23, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours a ruby-raisin with blood-amber highlights that grows darker towards the bottom of the bottle. Almost a gusher, huge head.
Smell: A definite tartness with raisins, dates, plums, prunes and lots of berries (blackberry, raspberry) and some black currants. Very jammy. The dark berries are the most dominant part. Also a wine cabernet sauvignon element with some oak undertones that gives off noticeable tannins.
Taste: The acidity hits with a serious punch, more so than any other sour I have had*. My tongue still feels the scorch of citric acid the next day. This is a very, very sour beer. The dark berries dominate (blackberry, raspberry) along with raisins, dark sour cherries, dates, plums, prunes, and black currants. The wine element is here as well, definitely cabernet sauvignon / merlot with oaky undertones and tannins. There is absolutely no vinegar element to this beer, and little funk to speak of - though I wish there was some of both. A bit of balsamic vinegar.
Mouthfeel: Light with a champagne-like carbonation. 
This is a very good beer, but there is something holding it back from greatness.
Drinkability: The extreme sour does a good job balancing out the high level of dark fruits; I was shocked to see it is 10% as I felt it but didn't taste it.
*NB: Had the newest batch on 4/7/2011, either they grow much more sour with age or the newer bottles are much less sour and flavorful/bold. 1,431 characterscraytonic, Feb 22, 2009

4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The latest from Russian River showed up in Portland this week; as far as I know, Saraveza was the first to tap their 1/6 barrel. Got an 8 oz. pour (into a regal PBR goblet!) this evening after work..."only" $5!
A: Arrives at the table a still-looking ruddy brown, a barely sudsy ring of white clinging around the edges. I suspect there's etching in the glass causing this effect, but a surprisingly cool/mesmerizing swirl in the gauzy head forms a 'cloverleaf' shape to appear. Lace is creamy, but too slippery to stick for more than a couple seconds, leaving a scattershot array of speckles. 
S: Has a familiar 'funky' tartness, but doesn't strike mme as terribly strong. Vinous fruit (vaguely 'grape' or crab apple), light oak, citrus rind and fleeting candy sweetness. A light vinegar, sweet and malty, makes me ponder what Consecration would be like over fish & chips.
T: Woody tang covers a notably tart fruit, the tannic currant represents well. Has an earthen berry flavor throughout, a musty fruit punch. A little cider like, akin to apple mash, with a twist of zesty citrus: lime? As it warms, becomes a bit sweeter: doughy malt and a pinch of brown sugar. 
M: Luscious medium-full thickness. Not as acidic as it could be, but has a modest enamel-scraping potency. Curls the tongue and seems to linger in odd places, between the cheek and gums in particular. Low alcohol warmth, pretty smooth for the style.
D: Not gonna say this is the greatest thing I've ever had, but it's tasty. Damn tasty. Surprisingly easy to drink, with a nice level of tart/sweet 'refreshment'. Complex enough to sit and savor, enjoyable enough to have another, even two (if it weren't 10%). Glad to have tried this on draught, will age a bottle or two to see what develops. 1,763 charactersmsubulldog25, Feb 20, 2009

2.58/5  rDev -41.5%look: 2 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 |  overall: 28 oz pour served on tap in a chalice at Saraveza.
Not much to look at. Barely any bubbles at all, let alone head. Dark reddish amber, almost brown see-through body. Zero lacing.
Things get more interesting right away with the first sniff. Massive tart/sour fruit- cherry, fermenting wine- and vinegar smells up front. Once it warms up, small hints of other aromas appear: oak, some sweetness and a teaser of the brett to come. Quite interesting.
In the mouth, the sour flavors once again dominate at first, but things develop quickly as the beer warms up. Some of these things are more pleasant than others. Sour cherryish flavors on the edges of the tongue, overwhelming nasty brett funkiness up the middle as I swallow (I have cultivated an appreciation for milder funkiness that complements the other flavors in a beer, but the brett is simply too strong here for my taste). Hints of sweet currant and oak all around. Sour lingering aftertaste. The brett basically ruins this beer for me.
The moderate-light carbonation is certainly more than I would have thought based on the looks of it. Really makes all that sourness tingle all over the tongue. Dry and sour finish leaves me wanting a sip of water after every swallow. Probably would have rated the feel a lot higher if the brett didn't linger all over the palate threatening to activate my gag reflex.
Drinkability is not good. I like the sourness, but the overpowering brett nastiness severely limits extended enjoyment for me.
Overall impression: Definitely doesn't live up to the hype for me. Hopefully the Supplication and Temptation I recently traded for are better. This much brett has no place in beer! (at least not the beer going into this mouth) 1,719 charactersPDXHops, Feb 19, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Grabbed some bottles of this from my local supplier La Bodega. Thanks for carrying some sweet stuff in a beer wasteland such as Riverside.
Poured into my Russian River Barrel aged snifter. Pours a nice looking dark brown with a thick tan head that dissapated to about 1/4" and stayed there. Not alot of sticky lacing though.
Smells of alot of bret funk with tart cherries and some oak. Smells like this is gunna be awesome.
Taste is wonderful hands down best sour I have had so far. You can really taste the wine notes from the barrels and the oak and bret mixed with the malts is sublime. Wonderful
Mouthfeel is perfect for this beer. Couldn't ask for more.
Drinkability is high and usually I can't drink that many sours in a row but I could drink the entire 750 by myself but I'm being nice and sharing it with a buddy. Glad I bought a couple. 850 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Feb 19, 2009

Pours a clear reddish amber color with little head. Aromas of sour fruit, woody tannins and wine characters blend well with dark sour fruit flavors, oak and red wine. A drying, tart finish full of wonderfully balanced flavors rounds it out very well. High drinkability for a beer that is 10% alcohol. You would never know it. I could drink an awful lot of this beer, and thankfully have had it 3 times now. Fantastic. 611 characterskleffman, Feb 19, 2009

Pours a murky brown with a very active, but thin head. Smell is of ripe fruits- I get prunes, rasberry, and the like. Some sugary alcohol and vinegar as well. Taste is not as sour as I had imagined. Really smooth flavor, actually. Again, some dark fruits, and smooth rich wine flavor. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Some active carbonation in the mouth, but overall very smooth and rich. Not my fave RR, but very good. 501 charactersDrDogbeer, Feb 17, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Another Russian River homerun.
Having long been a lover of sours, I couldn't have been more excited to try this beer. Thankfully my girlfriend indulged me and we made the pilgrimage up to Toronado's for Russian River TION night.
The first sip of this beer, I knew I was in for something special. I've had beers that tried to toe the line between beer and wine before (Craftsman's Cabernale... I'm looking at you) but never have I had one that did it this successfully.
I took a sip and handed it to my girlfriend, the wine snob to my beer geek, and waited for her verdict. 
"Wow, this is really good." 
"Yeah, I know!"
Trying to describe this beer, it is just so difficult to do it justice. The flavors are many and layered. Probably one of the most complex beers I've ever had.
My attempt: Notes of black currant, sour cherry, oak, all with a perfect touch of acid and funk that compliments the beer, rather than defines it.
This is going to be a tough beer to find, but trust me, the search will be worth it. This is one of those breakthrough beers that really pushes a new style to the forefront. 1,107 charactersSandstone, Feb 17, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Russian River. A silly bar pour leaves the beer nearly spilling out of the glass. No head. The beer is a dark, dark reddish purple. 
The nose is of tart raspberries and plums with a touch of vinegar. The currants work very nicely in the beer. This is reminiscent of the Toronado 20th. There are faint alcohol notes, but it relatively well hidden for 10%. Much like the aroma, the flavor is of ripe, tart raspberries and those delicious currants again. There is a nice medium level of sourness to Consecration. The finish is dry and slightly puckering, with just a touch of alcohol.
This is a medium-full bodied sour with low carbonation. The mouthfeel is vinous. This is the closest thing I've had to Toronado. I'd love to do a side by side comparison of the two. The alcohol is well hidden, which leads to a damn drinkable strong sour. I'm glad I stocked up on this. 879 charactersHopHead84, Feb 17, 2009

A: After the CO2 bomb settled it poured a beautiful dark red with a bubbly light red colored head. 
S: Smell was funky, sour, tanic and full of a sweet acidity. Very appealing, so much so that it was hard to let it warm for more than a few minutes before taking the first sip.
T: Big cherry fruit sourness hits the edges of your tongue. Then sweet notes follow and tame it ever so much. The finish was soooo long and dry and the taste turned to grape skins. One of the best finishes I have ever experienced. 
M: Light body due to the massive carbonation. As it should be for this style. 
D: Very, VERY drinkable. I shared it with two others but could easily enjoy the bottle all to myself despite the high ABV.
Overall: I have loved each of the RR sours for what they offer and amazingly they are all different. This one is a welcome introduction into the world of dark sours and I absolutely loved it. An ace. 1,069 characterssession1979, Feb 15, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4a- A malted straw color, with a minimal head that disipates very quickly because of the high acidity of this brew!
s- Like saltwater taffey, which sounds weird, maybe it is because i was staring at some when i was smelling it (at verdugo bar, ca). very very weird and cool smell. insane funk, and barnyard! 
T- Lemon grass, citrus (beyond lemon...like afterthought of grapefruit)...and maybe even a little cranberry tart to it as well. so deep. it lingers like nobodys mom.
M- tangy, medium bodied, full of flavor, and as mentioned before, lingering! Very acidic and leaves a buttery film on your teef.
D- I could drink this all day, except for the fact that it will give you a headache from the acid...or at least me haha. 727 charactersslayer3604, Feb 15, 2009
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: 750ml corked and caged bottle, batch 001x4, into a Russian River 'Tion tulip. Pours a beautifully clear chestnut amber with crimson highlights. Incredible color on this stuff, especially when held to the light. The head rises high but is short lived, receding to a ring rather quickly.
Smell: Vinous and chocolatey, big fruit overtones and woody tannins. Restrained funkiness; rather clean actually. Hints of spiciness and alcohol. A touch of raspberry and vanilla sweetness appears at warmer temperatures.
Taste & mouthfeel: Tart fruitiness quickly followed by woody tannins, earth and dry red wine. Hints of chocolate and caramel are present beneath it all, the last remnants of Salvation, perhaps? This all leads into a tart, dry and juicy finish with a blast of black currant. Consecration has nailed the beer/wine hybrid more than any other Russian River beer. While it's good stuff, I do find it a bit overwhelming. 9 times out of 10 I'd rather drink Supplication or Temptation. 998 characterslargadeer, Feb 14, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A brand new Russian River sour, and one that's high in alcohol. Had some on-tap at Verdugo Bar in Los Angeles. On to the beer:
Poured into a tulip, Consecration is a dark red-violet beer with little head retention, leaving no lacing on the glass, but the latter wasn't expected from much. The aroma is a beautiful thing. Sweet vinegar, akin to what you'd find in ketchup or barbecue sauce. Pickel juice. Notes of oak and barrel. Slight underlying sweetness underneath it. 
My first impression of the taste was it was very intensely acidic upfront. But what sour isn't acidic? Bits of tartness show through, as do assorted, overripened fruits. There's a long lasting, pleasant aftertaste of vinegar on the palate. The high alcohol presents a faint, but noticable boozy aspect with a sharp pinch towards at the back of the line. 
A good sour, but I'm not as big of a fan as everyone else seems to be. But I have had heard several accounts say the bottled version is ten times better than the draft version I sampled Maybe I need to sample the bottle someday for its optimal performance. 1,087 charactersDoubleJ, Feb 13, 2009

A- Outstanding ruby reddish dark brown color with a frothy tan head on it.
S- i think i am wine tasting, very strong red wine hint here, little funky and definently going to make you pucker!!
T- Great, I have had all but the ultra rare RR sours and this is my favorite right there with beatifacation, This offering bring so much more to the table, Starts sweet fruit wine and leaves you sour and dry, tons of changes here.
M- High carb and all else it what is to be expected.
D- Love it, i could have 2 750s easy, great sipper that improve as it warms.
Overall, great RR offering that i will be stocked up on for a while if i can resist the temptation to drink, so far i am not doing good and at $25 a bottle i cannot afford any more!! 795 charactersJWD, Feb 13, 2009

A- A near gusher once uncorked. Pours with the appearance of coke-a-cola with a monster 2 inch tan foamy head that hangs around for a while. No lacing observed. Small tan ring left behind. When held up to the light, a clear rusty garnet color. A couple lone streamers noted.
S- The obvious upfront vinegary sour tang with an appreciable presence of sour fruit and raspberries. Subtle woodiness, cinnamon. Mmm smells yum.
T- Once again....Tangy vinegar, sour cherry raspberry...I guess that must be the currants. Sour apple, with longstanding tangy sour. Subtle wood that gives off some phenolic hints.
M- Smooth mild body with great carbonation that continues to bubble until it is all gone. Leaves your mouth dry but your salivary glands working overtime.
D- Another great tasting sour from RR. You have to be able to appreciate sours to appreciate this excellant sour. I have only recently started venturing into the wonderful world of sours. I am glad to have had this opportunity. 1,044 charactersm1ked, Feb 12, 2009

There is nothing glamorous about this beer's appearance. It's murky maroon'ish brown looking but there's nothing really off putting about it either, hence it's fine. What my nose and tongue pick up is a very sour cherry-like presence. This is followed by a dry tannic finish, very woody. The high alcohol is not really noticeable and the mouthfeel is a pretty light consistency. This beer is so easy to drink it's dangerous at 10%. 483 charactersMiScusi, Feb 11, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Russian River. Pours dark, but not cloudy, just shimmering and purple to deep red. Almost no head, just a ring of light purple bubbles. Smells of tart cherries, red wine esters, alcohol. Nose is rich and inviting. Taste is supremely delicious. Sour, wine-like fruit flavor...lots of tart cherries, lip smackin'! Chocolate malt lingers beneath, but the feature is the big sourness that's just everywhere. I also get some currants and raspberries in there too. Sourness doesn't decrease much as i drink more, which i've found to be the case with other sours, it just sticks around and makes every sip a great and interesting experience. Drinks like a dream...a fantastic and memorable beer. 698 charactersaforbes10, Feb 09, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow.
Pours a clean amberish brown that glistens with a wicked orange tint when held to light. Tight frothy white head belies the brew's color.
Smell is heavy on the funk, acidic fruit, and oak. The taste is just heavenly. So smooth, so dangerously drinkable. Crazy oak, just the right amount of funk, a definite acidic sourness that's offset by the light sweet notes of barely-ripe-currants and vinegary citrus. There's a real vinous/wine undercurrent that provides an interesting base. Touching off the wine base is a cherry/raspberry (is that what currants taste like?) bite.
Just fantastic. Great champagne-esque bubbly mouthfeel. Russian River has hit the perfect blend of sour and sweet fruit.
**As I continue to drink this, the theme of this beer is "balance." Just perfectly in harmony. 797 charactersOverlord, Feb 09, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml, corked and caged bottle, batch 1. Consumed 02/06/2009 at the city beer store PTY release. Thanks for sharing, madorb.
Dark raspberry rust with a nice off-white head of clingy foam that lasts and provides the viewer with legs and sheets of lace.
The aromas is somewhat similar to the toronado 20th, however, this is sharper with a definite big fruit nose up front from the currant. Also, the acidity is cleaner and less muddled than the 20th.
The taste is BIG and sour. When I found out that this was 10%abv, I was honestly shocked, as this drinks like a thirt quencher. The flavors are of big fruit, oak, and brett funk with a lovely mid palatte biscuit malt punch, and the faintest dead green dry hop in the background. This drinks like heavenly juice.
The mouthfeelis like lightly carbonated wine, when swished in the mouth extra carbonation is released smoothly hitting every single taste bud in your mouth, and making those buds sing with the joyous flavors of this nectar.
Drinkability is perfect. I can and will drink this one all day, thank god this is a somehwat bigger batch than we usually get for these RR wild ale releases. A few choice Bay Area retailers got up to 20 cases of this stuff, and even though the brewpub itself is almost sold out, there will be a second batch released in a few months....Also, this will be on tap at the Toronado on Tuesday night, and kegs may find their way to other sleect draft account in the bay area as well.
Another masterwork from Vinnie and Co.

S - Currants, cherries, mild funk, wood and awesome. I had a good feeling after smelling this one.
T - Yeah. It's good. Not really a big fan of sours but I thought Consecration was the best of the style I have had. Not overly sour or sweet. Currants keep the flavor in check on the fruity side allowing me to be able to pick out vinegar, brown sugar and wood flavors as well. Some notes of tobacco, leather and wine are noted as well.
M - Much like a good wine. Medium bodied and only slightly drying.
D - Effing awesome at the bar. I gave this a perfect as it made me think twice about getting another Younger, but it ultimately lost. I will have this every chance I get. 848 charactersbifrostguard, Feb 04, 2009

A: Pours darker than a beet red, with a small cap of white foam.
S: Got some interesting cherry and wine notes, but wanted a bit more. Some chocolate in there too.
T: Heavy balsamic vinegar and wine character, almost had a rancid fruit characteristic, in a good way though. Fig and dark fruit notes. Not light on the funk. Sweetness comes out in the finish to the beer which I liked. Not the greatest flavour for me, but certainly interesting.
M: Upfront acidity, then the mouthfeel lightens up a bit, a little too thin at times.
D: An intriguing beer from Russian River. I don't think I liked it as much as everyone around me did, but I enjoyed trying it.
Edit - I've had this beer a few times since the original review, still not wowed, but I've found myself liking it more and more. Upping the taste score to a 4 (from 3.5). 854 charactersHalcyondays, Jan 31, 2009

Absolutely delicious and a great pleasure to drink this with friends. Poured a garnet tinged amber with a slight head. Beautiful color. Lovely aromas of cherries and ruby Port, with some astringency on the finish. Tastes tremendously complex with cherries, a little bit of funk, quite loamy and bitter- not horseblanket funk, but an earthier, forest funk. Quite astringent and a bit of sweet licorice on the finish. Dark and brooding with wildly interesting flavors. Quite intriguing. Smooth, tannic, and sour in the mouth. Utterly delicious and fascinating and extremely easy to drink despite the high abv. 747 charactersGeorgiabeer, Jan 25, 2009

S: The aromas are bold and big on wine. Tons of sour red fruit with hints of sweet tarts, funk, and cherry juice. Inviting.
T: The sweet tarts come thru as does a bit of crushed aspirin. Beneath that is a wonderful mix of red fruit that is heavy on the cherries. Winey sourness pushes thru along with bits of wood, and vineous qualities. Yummy.

This beer has a mild tart aroma. I can smell some grapes also. It smells wine like, probably because it is aged in wine barrels, you think? It also smells slightly fruity, with some cherry and black currants. A slight oaky aroma is also present.
This beer tastes just like it smells. Tart, and a little sour, with a slight fruity flavor of grapes, cherries and black currants. 
This beer hides the alcohol well. It leaves a tart aftertaste. Carbonation is perfect.
This beer would probably not be the best session beer. It is high in alcohol, and it is easy to forget that since it is so easy to drink.
Overall: This beer is yet another outstanding wild ale from Vinnie and Russian River. I love it, as I expected. If you ever get the chance, do not hesitate to try this beer. 991 charactersOStrungT, Dec 23, 2008

4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Growler courtesy of Strelnikov poured into a goblet.
Pours a deep, clear copper with a decent bubbly cream head that dissipated quickly to a thin collar.
The aroma is wonderfully complex with the slightly sharp currant sweetness on top of a sugary sweetness. The barrel characteristics are also present with hints of vanilla in the nose. The brett is there to lend an ever-so-slight sourness with a complementary earthy funk in the background.
The taste seems to be a more complex and balanced version of the nose. The sweetness hits up front with the light tartness of the currants balanced by the underlying sugars. The brett makes its presence felt but the finish is very vinous with the oak playing a role as well.
The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and very wine-like with a dry finish and bits of funk throughout.
This is a fantastic beer and one of the better sours I've had the opportunity to try. It's superbly well balanced and extraordinarily drinkable for the ABV. Highly recommended. 1,002 charactersgford217, Dec 13, 2008

a - a dark brown color with a purplelish hue, modest white head with moderate lacing, lots of bubbles on the side and rising to the top
s - good deal of sweet dark berries and some oak along with some sour notes
t - tastes almost like a slightly less sweet and more sour grape kool-aid with some 7-Up thrown in for carbonation, but that doesn't do this beer justice, much more complex with strong oak notes thrown in, maybe it was just the fact that I knew it was aged in cabernet barrels, but the grape and oak definitely came through strong, the sourness was moderate and not as strong as, for example, Beatification or Sanctification, the alcohol really isn't noticeable at all, which is surprising given the 10% abv
m - medium-bodied, fuller bodied than other RR sours, good amount of carbonation, sourness is a little drying on the palate, but the sweetness balances that pretty well
d - quite drinkable despite the 10% advertised abv, the sourness is definitely not as strong and overwhelming on the palate as the other RR sours, particularly the Sanctification that was also on tap tonight, quite complex which keeps the beer interesting for several servings, overall, amazingly drinkable for a 10% abv sour ale
An extremely good beer overall. I haven't reviewed a beer in awhile, but this one warranted a formal review. I didn't find this one quite as good as Beatification (one of my top 3 beers ever), but it's not far behind. The cabernet barrel aging is very well done in that it lends complexity and character to the beer without totally overwhelming all other flavors. It'll be great to see this in bottles eventually. 1,661 charactersWeisGuy, Nov 29, 2008
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511/15/08- Had on tap at the Bistro Barrel Aged fest in Hayward, CA.
Presentation- Via the tap into small taster size glasses.
Appearance- Auburn colored pour, slightly murky but ultra fine yeast sightings if any. No real head and slight lace remnents.
Smell- Large amount of sour berries and lots of brett sourness and barnyard notes. 
Taste- Unlike other supperb Wild Ales by RR, this one has some serious depth. Or at least thickness and a more fruity base other than just sourness. Cherry, raspberry, blackberry...can't really tell what berry (although I think it's cherry). Very sour with sharp acidic flavor. Winelike taste due to the cab barrels used for aging. Almost seems like some mild sweetness trys to creep in, but can't get it's head through the door.
Mouthfeel- Very full mouthfeel for a Wild Ale. Sharp and ultra clean with a medium crisp carbonation level.
Drinkability- Right up there with all the other Wild Ales Vinnie brews, one of my new favorites. Winner of the fest IMO. 1,000 charactersGClarkage, Nov 17, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap @ Russian River. Hot damn am I happy to see this on the chalkboard.Clear ruby brown with a small beige head, fading to a thin ring before long, and swrved in a snifter. Big oak and red wine nose up front with the vinegar and sour apple notes next. Buttery brett and leather peak out stronger as I nose this, and it's hard to pick out the sweet dark fruit that is Salvation in the base beer. Whoo! Flavor is full of tons of sour fruits and berries with a definite dry red wine and oak finish. Sour factor peaked ~ a 6-7,and I wanted to add there was some low earthy bitterness in the backend as well. I'm hard-pressed to find any Salvation in this. Full body with light prickly carbonation--just a little warming in the belly implies the 10%. Really effing good--looks like my Iowa homies are getting one pricey growler! 826 charactersiowaherkeye, Nov 12, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is awsome. It has a base beer of its Salvation and aged in Silver Oak Cab barrels. It is not over the top sour, but just perfect. It does have a cab after taste and a wine like feel. The Salvation does not seem to come through too much or at all and is about a percent higher than it.
Wonderful beer and wish it was bottled 334 characterscalir1, Nov 11, 2008
4.61/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - The beer is a deep red, much like a cab. Fantastic lacing, small head.
S - The beer smells of oak, cab, and butter. Nothing surprising here.
T - The beer has a balanced taste of cab, butter, grapes, and a bit of yeast. I'll admit, cab is the only style of wine that I abhor, but Vinnie really made this work.
M - The beer is quite dense, probably more so than any sour I've ever had. This is very unique.
D - It's very strong for a sour, but it works as a sipper. This was so tasty that I got a growler, despite the hefty price tag. Vinnie is still the king when it comes to sours. 585 characterssessycuban, Nov 10, 2008
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Poured into a goblet with a small off-white head and an opaque brown body, reddish-brown on the edges.
S: Sour apples, oak, red wine, gum (ever had Bubblicious before? Something like that).
T: Strong taste of a cabernet sauvignon, sour light fruit (white grapes and apples), yeast, and a bit mango chutney. 
M: Dense, compact carbonation. Sharp sour kick at the end.
D: A pretty intense but delicious beer, so couldn't have too many. My favorite sour ale as of yet. Would've got a growler of it but a bit too spendy. 519 characterslhaqq, Nov 09, 2008

I was able to sneak into a spot at the bar and got one of the first glasses of this, the first keg blew in 5 minutes (before Chris even had a chance to announce it was on tap) and the second only lasted an additional 15 minutes; I was definitely quite lucky to get two glasses of this beer. The beer arrives with quite a clear appearance, it is the hue of a raisin with a rich concentrated color and shows a deep red hue when held up to the light. It is topped by a pale, ring of a head that after a bit forms a brown tinged, full tan colored head that just covers the beer. The aroma definitely has a tartness to it, but also has a rich, thick fruitiness to it that reminds me of a mix of concentrated tamarind, syrupy-fruity balsamic vinegar and rich raisins.
As the beer first hits my tongue it is chewy and rich; a sour beer with a substantial texture (at the time I didn't realize how strong this beer was, but in hindsight the richness makes a lot of sense). Tannins coat my teeth and there is a soft, yet noticeable barrel character in the finish that adds a spicy oak bite. Rich raisin flavors, a substantial berry-like wine note, as well as some rich dried fig and prune flavors all combine to provide a big, fruit-driven backbone that anchors the flavor of this beer. The rich fruit and oak flavors is tempered by a mouth puckering, somehow rich, sourness that is mostly lactic in character but sees to have some acetic overtones to it that reminds me of some sort of berry vinegar as well as hints of a rich, grape balsamic notes. The beer almost develops a raspberry flavor at times, and this actually is pretty nice (says someone who generally shies away from raspberry flavors in beer). As I contemplate my second glass of this beer I start to notice more of the oak flavors coming to the fore with flavors of vanilla, light coconut that is sort of Bourbon-like somehow as well as a structured wine character and a definite berry note that seems like a wine signature.
I haven't said this yet, but this beer is just fantastic. It has an incredible balance of tartness to rich fruit and light, though structured oak character. The flavor is just so well integrated, everything just seems to work together to carry this beer up to another level of complexity and interest. The oak really does add lots of structure, which goes a long way towards helping the overall balance of this beer. I like that the incredibly rich fruit character never gets overwhelming (back to that balance again). This is an awesome beer, whose enjoyment I am sure was magnified by the setting as well as the prior afternoon session of the GABF. 2,672 charactersGueuzedude, Oct 31, 2008
