Smell:  Citrus, dank, vegetal.  Not as strong as I would think for a DDH beer.
Taste:  Balanced, bready and fruity.  Moderate citrus.  Very low bitterness.
Overall:  Picked up a bomber with bottled date 5/11, consumed on 5/14.  I've heard that sometimes with DDH beers they need to sit for a week or two after bottling for best results.  I suppose I should have done that with this beer because it was pretty underwhelming considering the massive amount of praise in other reviews.  I would call it a well made pale ale but nothing spectacular. 584 charactersMdog, May 21, 2017

Not too many words for this beer. 
Perfect appearance with the right amount of haze. 
Aroma is on point with plenty of citrus notes, grapefruit, and faint hints of pineapple. 
Taste is on par with aroma. Grapefruit / citrus notes to carry the beer through. 
Mouthfeel was light to medium with a creamy afterfeel. 
Overall this is a beer that must be sought out. Definitely the best pale ale I've ever had. I would keep this stocked in the fridge if it was available in my area year round. Might not be my favorite beer of all time, but definitely my favorite pale ale. 636 charactersbmrattay, Apr 30, 2017

A- pours a golden-orange color with a one-finger foamy white head that reduces to a thin film floating on top, laving a bit of lacing behind
S- tons of juicy citrus up front with highlights of tangerine, grapefruit & a hint of lemon.  Undertones of herbal and tropical aromas, with notes of passionfruit, mango & guava.  Just a hint of malty sweetness to round it out
T- juicy citrus hops follow the nose up front with a blast of orange pith, tangerine & grapefruit zest.  Mid-palate brings an tropical mix of melon, pineapple and passionfruit.  As it nears the finish, resinous notes of pine and fresh cut grass bring it to a close with some earthy/herbal linger
M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a slightly creamy, dry finish, super drinkable
O- the base beer is already awesome, the double dry hopping just kicks it up a notch.  Juicy and dank, but remaining super drinkable, one of the best pale ales I've had the pleasure of trying 1,026 charactersTreyliff, Apr 25, 2017

4.7/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Why hello there Mr. Tall, Dark & Hopsome! Just when you though that the Sue couldn't get any more attractive, the brewers at Toppling Goliath dressed their rock star up in a double dry hop dosing of Citra hops for a centerfold of flavor that's sexier than ever.
Citra Double Dry Hop SpeudoSue pours with the fresh squeezed, pulpish haze of any New England style pale ale and then crowned with a sepia meringue before casting a fragrant citrus spell upon the senses. Striking the nose with the bold perfume of orange laden citrus, softly muddled herb and hints of tropical fruit and the mere scent leaves the mouth salivating. Juicy, sweet and fruity, the malt structures share the light caramel and honey of fructose along with a bready backbone seemingly of poundcake.
As the malts slowly release from the palate, the hops roll in with a confident array that starts with mandarin orange, pink grapefruit, lime, lemon and herbal verbena. The middle palate soon invites the tangy succulence of pineapple, passionfruit, kiwi and cantaloup for an extra measure of seduction. Fresh grass clippings, softly shaven pine and the fine hemp-like herbalness of chive and geranium create a smooth and vegetal bitterness that has the tastebuds begging for more.
Like catnip for hopheads, the medium bodied beer trends dry, crisp and clean. Its smooth bitterness keeps in keeping with the pale ale style, but its hop-forward attitude has the senses seeing IPA of the highest degree. A medium length aftertaste of fruit peels and herb evokes the memories of fruit gelato and creamsicle. 1,575 charactersBEERchitect, Apr 21, 2017

4.89/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Was really looking forward to this one and it did not disappoint. This beer really is world-class. 
Poured from a 22oz bottle into an oversized wine glass. Dated 3/17/17 so less than a month on it. Pours a very cloudy ruby orange color--pretty much opaque. Very little head and decent lacing. Pretty much what I would expect for this style. However the color is what makes this beer so gorgeous to look at. There is a little sediment at the bottom of the bottle (poured into my second glass). 
Aroma is on point--possibly the strongest aspect of this beer... Absolutely delicious. Very potent fruity mango and citrus tones with a definite hoppy backbone. The mixture of mango and citra hops is like nothing I have ever experienced.
The hops hit you right away upon taking a sip, but as I continue to drink the mango and citrus flavors becomes more prevalent. Bitter yet very refreshing finish. Would be perfect for a hot summer day.
Feel is medium thickness, average carbonation for a pale ale. Very smooth sipping overall. Feels like a lightly carbonated fruit juice--but tastes SO much better.
Would make this my go-to beer if it were constantly available. Just a perfect medley of hops and fruit. Glad I picked up a few 22oz bottles but may have to get more this week to save for summer... Undeniably one of the best beers I have had. 1,342 charactersBdubz94, Apr 15, 2017

4.69/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottled on 3/16/17. Served from 22 oz. bottle into glass. Pours pale gold in color, with yellow orange tint, super hazy with creamy white head. Huge fresh hop aroma right away: lots of citrus and tropical fruit, orange, mango, grapefruit. Smells like a mimosa made with freshly squeezed orange juice. No herbaceous or piney aroma but a subtle freshly mowed grass in the background. No malt aroma detectable. Flavor is more fruity hops, orange juice and grapefruit. A little clean malt sweetness. Dry finish with medium grapefruit bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. Overall this beer is another fruity hop bomb. The color, hazy appearance and citrus aroma instantly creates the impression of a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. This idea persists throughout the flavor and the finish, resulting in a beer that is overwhelmingly citrus oriented. The flavor, body and finish makes a superbly drinkable and interesting beer. A great expression of Citra hops and the dry hopping process in general and an overall great beer. 1,031 charactershandmuffin, Apr 02, 2017

Smell - The nose was a big citrus bouquet. 
Taste - Lemon and grass lead the way to a great dry backbone. The hops are not punishing, but are well balanced unllike many dry hopped beers. There is even some spice at the finish. 
Mouthfeel - The carbonation keeps the sweetness from dominating by brushing it clean from the tongue.

Look: Poured golden and hazy. About an inch of white head and the beer laced around the top of the glass. 
Smell: Tropical fruit notes everywhere, orange, passionfruit, grapefruit, pineapple. 
Taste: Just like the smell, a bit of hop and bitterness followed by waves and waves of fruit. You can catch a bit of malt sweetness here and there. 
Feel: Medium, smooth and juicy. Crisp finish and a good amount of carbonation. 
Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. One of my favorite pale ales 554 charactersCwaks, Mar 19, 2017

4.47/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25What a really delicious beer.  Has the notorious color noted for many of this style, i.e., east coast IPA, with the newborn stool yellow/brown.  Cloudy is an understatement.  Smallish white head that settles out.  
Wonderful aroma of fruity hops, lots of tropical fruit with an understated richness and firmness.  Similar in the taste.  A lighter but apparent smooth bitterness than enhances but never distracts or overpowers.  Leaves in due time and finishing the drink enjoyably.  Fullness and thinness if both can be true.  The thinness belies the smaller abv, but there is a fullness that keeps it from being thin and carbonated just enough to add to the feel.
This is really fun and enjoyable. 698 charactersgarymuchow, Mar 19, 2017

First, let's talk about the pour. The DDH Citra Sue pours a golden hazy sunshine, and right off the bat, the citrus notes blast your senses. Imagine all the greatness of an orange, grapefruit, pineapple juice and the balance of a perfectly-executed IPA, and that's DDH Sue.
I can't recommend it enough. It's just wonderful. 416 charactersboettr90, Mar 13, 2017

Pours a honey-colored haze.  One could mistake it for OJ.  Smells amazing - mango, passion fruit, grapefruit.  Taste matches with some subtle piney bitterness.  Nice velvety mouthfeel.  
TG makes some of the best smelling beers I've had.  They do amazing things with hops.  Any bomber of theirs is definitely worth trying.  The Florida cans are a different story. 401 charactersDharmelink, Mar 10, 2017

Look- A deep hazy orange with almost 2 fingers of white head. The lacing covered the entire glass by the end. 
Smell- A juice monster with grapefruit, orange, and tangerine for sure. Some other tropical notes coming through. It blends into a delicious aroma that hits you as soon as the bottle opens and lasts throughout. 
Taste- The tropical fruits blend just like the smell. The orange seems strongest but the grapefruit is not far behind. The first portion of the bottle had more of a piney bitterness but it changes toward the bottom. 
Feel- Moderate carbonation with a juicy feel throughout. 
Overall- A fantastically balanced Pale Ale. The smell and taste really cause this one to stand out. Definitely a world class brew. A little dry finish that left me wanting more! 835 charactersKdouble, Mar 04, 2017

Smell: Oranges, passion fruit, some pineapple. Very aromatic. 
Taste: All the aroma and more. orange juice hits you up front, followed by a softer passion fruit note and some sour pineapple, and finishes with that orange again. Nice stuff. 
Feel: Ddh Sue keeps a medium full body, showing off ample carbonation throughout, and a slight bitterness in the finish. Not exactly the soft mouthfeel some heavily hopped beers have nowadays, but not the astringent west coast style pale ale either. 
Overall: This takes Pseudo Sue, an already world class pale ale, to another level. The appearance certainly is that north east look, hazy as all get out, and the aroma and taste are all tropical fruit. World class. 859 charactersCfred371, Mar 02, 2017

I'll start this out by stating that I've never had a NE IPA, but I would imagine that the look of this beer is incredibly similar.  Sits in the glass a hazy yellow/orange, almost looks like a glass of pineapple or orange juice.  Nice fluffy 2 finger head.  Obviously it's a double hopped citra so the nose is pineapple, mangos, stone fruit, citrusy juices, and a little bit of orange peels.  It tastes almost exactly as it smells, it's definitely a juice bomb with the faintest bit of bitterness at the end, maybe the slightest touch of pine.  The mouthfeel is incredible.  It feels like a smoother, fuller taste.  I get this from Decorah Sue as well as King Sue as well, but I believe this one to be even more pillowy.  There still is a bit of carbonation and crispness to it as well.  Overall, I've been waiting a while to get my hands on this beer and it definitely lived up to the hype!  I saw it listed on the To-Go list on their website this morning so my wife jumped in her car and made the 2 hour drive.  This beer is fantastic!  I bought 9 bombers of it and am incredibly happy that I did.  At 2 days old, they will last me a little while.  Can't say enough good things about TGB's beers, especially their entire "Sue" line. 1,310 charactersB-Stad, Feb 27, 2017

The color is a beautiful hazyish maize, almost straw-like. The nose is one of my favorite things about this beer & will not disappoint. A bouquet of citra with a touch of some funk; almost earthy. A nice white, creamy head that laces well. Taste is off the charts: grapefruit front-end but has a malt base that helps to balance a bit. The hop is there to compliment, not necessarily over power. I cannot say enough positive about this beer. 562 charactersumichfan, Feb 25, 2017

A: Pours a hazy, pale orange in color with a super frothy, 1 inch, paper white head. Good retention. Thick, billowy white lacing throughout.
S: Huge aromas of citrus and tropical fruits. Orange, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, melons, mango, and guava. Smells like a tropical fruit smoothie.
T: Huge juice bomb! Starts off with heavy notes of grapefruit and orange rind followed by a tropical fruit medley of pineapple, mango, melons, papaya, guava, and passion fruit. Finishes with a nice piney, resinous, palate-smacking, lingering bitterness.
F: Medium bodied. Super juicy and smooth. Crisp, with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: Overall, this is a fantastic Pale Ale. Perfectly balanced between the juiciness and hop bitterness. Super crushable. Another job well done by TG. I did review this beer awhile back and will say it has drastically improved since then. Almost a completely different beer and much more juicy. Hoping this becomes more of a regular in their line up because it's amazing. 1,065 charactersBeerGuy8315, Feb 18, 2017

Pours a hazy yellow with a beautiful white creamy head.  The nose is full of wonderful citrus, predominantly grapefruit and a hint of orange.  The taste is wet and juicy with notes of grapefruit, orange and pineapple.  It finishes with a clean, crisp hop bite.   Its thirst quenching abilities are amazing.
I'm generally always very skeptical of hyped beers, but this thing meets and beats the hype!  Amazing and leaps better than regular PS. 481 charactersnawpnawp, Feb 09, 2017

Smell is very powerful and enticing pineapple, cannabis, grass, wheat, and some whiffs of potent sharp yeast as it warms from time to time--but it barely had the chance to warm, as it was gone in a hurry.
Taste is wheat, lemongrass, cannabis, mango, and cream, all in very powerful and delicious bursts.
Feel is fluffy soft, with a dry almost chalky finish that is my only minor quibble about this stellar brew.
Enjoyed this side by side with XHOPS Gold and Sosus, and it was a delight to experience how truly unique each beer was relative to each other. 614 charactersSabtos, Feb 06, 2017

Poured from a 22oz bomber into an IPA glass. Very cloudy orange color that cannot be seen through. The scent smells almost powdery and earthy. There is a sharp bitterness to this pale ale right up front. The mouthfeel gets lighter as the beer warms up but smooth none the less. Overall a great fresh beer witha great label. 434 charactersBradfordStuckey, Feb 05, 2017

Aroma; overpowering citrus. A ton of citrus peel and very juicy. Floral and very inviting. The malt is heavy enough that you would think its a double IPA. 
Taste: again, overwhelming citrus. Very sharp and it pops in your mouth. It starts with sweet and juicy fruits and then the peel comes midway and to the finish. Very intense and the citrus just hangs around after that sip. I 
Mouthfeel: medium-bodied and very smooth.
Overall: this is the best pale ale I've tasted. What's crazy is the ABV is less than 6% yet so much flavor is packed into this single bottle. 645 charactersBenish, Feb 03, 2017

Appearance: Pours a very hazy golden orange. Moderate amount of bubbles and a big two finger white head which settles into a thin creamy patch. 
Smell: A very juicy and dank hop driven aroma with a scent of citrus fruit and pine. Huge citra hop presence with a scent of orange peel, mango, grapefruit, tangerine, melon, and papaya along with some pineapple and peach. Earthy hop scent of pine resin, grass, and cannabis.

I gets tons of pineapple, peach, and orange right away. Herbal and earthy notes in the background with mango, grapefruit, lime, guava. The fruit explosion on the nose doesn't translate all the wat to the taste. Very dry and pale up front. Then some sweet orange, mango, and grapefruit mid palate before the dry pale finish. It has some tropical notes as well but you have to search for it. Mouth feel is great for the abv, but it's difficult for me not to compare it to the creamy double IPAs I've been drinking. This is a great pale ale although I prefer the regular Sue I had last year. 659 charactersdanh53, Dec 16, 2016

A simply delicious ale.  Immediately before drinking, I read a review from M_chav and I concur wholeheartedly:  "So much juicy peach/pineapple goodness. the mouthfeel is amazing, you expect a beer with this much punch in the nostrils to have a big bitter profile but this is as soft as a pillow. It's up there with the best that I've ever had, just when you thought regular (iowa) Pseudo Sue couldn't get better, they create this magnificent mango/pineapple juice monster."  Thanks, M_chav.
Compared to regular Pseudo Sue, this has the decadent hop aromas and flavors, but seem to have a bit more malt backbone...just a bit.
I drove 3 hours to purchase this along with day 1 release of King Sue.  I'd do it again in a minute.  Cheers! 831 charactersSaxmanRick, Dec 06, 2016

4.88/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Bottled 11/22/16. Consumed 12/2/16.
A: Pours a hazy deep gold color with about a finger of fluffy white head. Medum-plus to full on haze; very little light passing through the liquid. Pillowy, almost scoopable head sticks around for a while and leaves bits of lacing on the glass. Beautiful looking pale ale.
S: Wow, the nose on this is absurd for the ABV. Explosively fruity with notes of sticky, sweet juice from a combination of overripe tropical and citrus fruits. I get big notes of peach, papaya, and cantaloupe with supporting aromas of pineapple, tangerine, and a hint of lemon. It’s truly a bouquet of fruits in a glass, all blending into a wonderfully appealing smell that makes it pretty damn hard not to dive right in to the taste. What I suspect is the assertive malt backbone on this provides a perfect sweetness that complements the hop aromas and adds to that “overripe fruit” aspect that is heavy on this one.
T: Follows the nose very closely. I get that same blend of overripe peach, pineapple, papaya, melon, and tangerine juice. Definitely some zesty citrus on the finish, which lingers with a pithy bitterness. The flavor profile is pretty clean overall, with very little dankness or earthiness to speak of. I get some herbaceous “greenness” on the backend, almost slightly chive-y, just enough to remind you you’re drinking a beer. Background of bready, lightly sweet malt perfectly carries the hop flavors.
M: Soft and creamy with moderate weight on the palate. This feels like a lot of Tree House beers, with that bready malt character offering a sturdy backbone to an intense yet delicate hop assault with a stinging pithy bitterness that sits on the tongue and rounds out a relatively clean taste.
O: My goodness, I don't really know what to say. This completely blew me away. King Sue is one of my favorite DIPAs, but the Florida Pseudosue can that I had a while back was terribly disappointing. I had heard the Sue bottled in Iowa was better (and that the DDH version was not even in the same league), but I couldn't have expected this. For a 5.8% hoppy pale, this packs a ridiculous amount of hop flavor and somehow balances it with a delicious, somewhat assertive malt backbone. The flavor and aroma profiles are an explosively juicy combination of tropical and citrus fruits, but that hoppiness is only one aspect of what makes this beer so tasty. It's that complementary malt profile and a clean, moderately dry finish that rounds this iteration of Sue out and makes a 22oz bomber way too easy to crush. This is probably my favorite pale ale and up there with some of my favorite IPAs. Really thankful I got to try this. 2,669 charactersavas, Dec 03, 2016

The nose is spectacular with this beer. Hints of mandarin orange, starfruit and pineapple. Lively and aromatic with a deep, sweet malt backbone. Really nice. Flavor is pineapple, mango and mandarin orange up front with a aromatic grassy bitterness in the back that, although subtle, complements the tropical fruit body nicely. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Super drinkable, goes down really easy and is bone dry going down. Excellent!
That this is a pale ale clocking in around 5%-6% is unbelievable as there's just so much going on, on the palate and in the nose here. Just a delight! 691 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jul 16, 2016

4.49/5  rDev -3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a brilliant crisp orange with a thin white head. Head dissipated rather quickly leaving a thin ring of film around the outside of the beer. 
Smell was a robust pungent citra aroma. If you want to know what citra hops smell like, crack this beer. Lovely aromas of orange, grapefruit and generic citrus like aromas. 
Taste followed the nose with a burst of orange and grapefruit flavors. Strong dry hopped flavor permeates the beers with a strong citra hop flavor. Mild sweetness throughout with a piney slightly bitter finish.  Its very similar to regular pseudo sue except for a much stronger hop presence in the flavor. Everything is just stronger, clearer, and crisper.
Feel was light, crisp, and smooth. Medium carbonation. Dry almost resinous finish.  Spot on just like regular Sue.
Overall, this was a lovely beer, really showcased the citra hops in a tasty way. That being said, give me regular old Sue anyday. 927 charactersFBarber, Jul 10, 2016

The aroma is excellent. Plenty of citrus -- orange juice predominant.
What a FABULOUS tasting beer.  Big citrus, orange juice, orange rind, a bit of candies oranges, a touch of grapefruit and mango with a near-perfect, lingering bitterness that drives you to the next sip.
Mouthfeel is medium, soft, perhaps a touch sticky

The last pour from the bottle looks exactly like Pseudosue used to it is turbid from the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Juicy Citra hops with no bitterness in the smell and taste. light body with creamy carbonation. Slight oily hop character as well. This beer reminds me of what Pseudosue used to be when TG began bottling Psue such a long time ago. It is nice to see that TG is getting back to its roots. This Psue is just like all those turbid and juicy hoppy beers from the east coast by the likes of Trillium, Treehouse, Alchemist, and Hill Farmstead brew. Hope this is a continuing trend at TG with all their hoppy brews. 690 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jun 22, 2016

4.68/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5650ml bottle, stamped Double Citra, bottled 5.24.16, poured into a Toppling Goliath Assassin Teku.
The beer pours a very hazy and cloudy copper color, golden hues with a firm, white head, that has very good retention and yields plenty of soapy lace. The aroma is great, loads of juicy citra hops, citrusy, floral, bursting with tropical fruit, a touch of doughy malt and some mineral water. The flavors are wonderful as well, really juicy fruit flavor, mild bitterness, a touch of rindy grapefruit but this is really intense with citrus fruit, a bit of wildflower, mild pine and sappy hop resin with doughy, chewy malt that offers a slight amount of sweetness to counterbalance this beer while there is a bit of minerality that lingers. The mouthfeel is good, coating, medium body with lively but gentle carbonation that finishes so smoothly with only a touch of dryness. 
Verdict: A truly world class pale ale from Toppling Goliath. Really hoppy, really juicy, really fresh, nice balance, it's everything you could ask for. The original beer is already so good so I'm not sure that is vastly different, but it definitely comes off as a bit more intense. Either way, phenomenal beer. 1,185 characterskevanb, Jun 18, 2016

4.6/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a huge, fluffy, off white head that sticks around forever. There are many webs and hanging rings of lacing too. Smell is incredible, it jumps out of the glass and can be noticed from across the room. Scents of dank citrus, candied orange, mango, grapefruit and pineapple all blend together wonderfully. The taste is similar, but definitely a level below the smell. Not quite as pronounced and amazing, but still awesome. Feel is light side of medium, resinous and sticky. Overall fantastic. Citra hops are my favorite, and this beer is a baby powdered up pimp slap of citra hops straight across the face. Absolutely incredible! 669 charactersCNoj012, Jun 10, 2016

4.28/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Amazing how fast this was snapped up in the Twin Cities. 22 oz. bottle with the faintest of stamps that appears to read 5/24/16. I need my readers. 
Pour looks like one of those mythical NE IPAs that nobody’s actually seen: dense yellow, dense head. As the beer settles, plenty of fleshy globs cluster conspiratorially near the bottom of the glass. Very tropical nose with orange protruding, drippingly resinous, sweet bread. Not bad. 
PseudoSue - Double Dry Hopped Citra matches the lovely ‘Sue from distant memory (don’t agree, well, it’s not your memory, so don’t take the piss). Plenty of tropical purée: mango, orange, ackee, etc. Enough bitterness that it doesn’t get lost in the fruitiness, but doesn’t crank call you at 2:30 AM, either. Mouthfeel is like soft water, gentle, easygoing. I could drink this all day. 
Put this in four-packs & I would staple it to the wall of my fridge. Excellent beer. Make more. 936 charactersmaximum12, Jun 09, 2016

Look: 4.5 - Pours a bright golden orange color with a puffy, 2 finger white head. Slight haze, but no opaque. Bubbles are small and tightly packed. Head remains for a few minutes before fading.
Aroma: 4.75 - Big tropical fruits... Mango and pineapple come to mind. Also some peach and passion fruit. Hops provide a depth of flavor that include some complimentary savory aromas like chives which add layers of complexity to it.
Taste: 4.75 - This is glorious. More juicy, fruity goodness. Mango, passion fruit, papaya, orange juice, pineapple, and the slightest hint of grapefruit zest. Medium sweetness but definitely not a "sticky" quality to it. There is a soft bitterness on the mid-palate and finish that brings the fruit flavors into balance. 
Mouthfeel: 4.5 - It's medium to medium-light body. The finish is incredibly smooth leaving just a hint of candied orange peel on the palate. 
Overall: 4.5 - This is a truly delightful beer and it's one of my favorite hoppy offering to come out of TG yet. This reminds me of my experiences with Toppling Goliath a few years ago when PseudoSue blew my mind for the first time. 1,176 charactersjakemn91, Jun 07, 2016

Appearance is hazy, golden-orange.  Nice lacing foam present upon pour.  Beautiful deep citrus aroma, with mango also abundant.  Taste, especially when compared to regular PseudoSue, is much more intense with juicy, citrus notes.  General easy-drinking yet full mouthfeel with good amounts of carbonation. Finish is smooth and slightly dry at the end.  
Overall, hard to look at regular PseudoSue the same again.  This is a step change from it, containing another level of depth of smell & taste.  Just more robust in general.  Would love to see it more often. 597 characterseifster82, Jun 04, 2016

4.49/5  rDev -3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5650ml bottle. Served in a gold TGB snifter glass.
Pours a mildly cloudy light copper-orange body, one finger white head, perfect amount of head and lacing, thin film, moderate collar, good retention. Smells of dank, resinous tropical fruit and citrus, a bit of grapefruit, touch of caramel and grainy pale malt sweetness. It's essentially what I remember old pseudoSue (when they still brewed and bottled pseudoSue at the Decorah brewery!) to be, but with a bit more more tropical fruit and resin. Flavour follows the nose, tropical fruit, citrus zesty bitterness, grapefruit, caramel, grainy cereal, not particularly bitter but loaded with hop aromatics. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, not too dry or too slick, mild citrusy zest bitterness. This isn't as juicy as the original regular pseudoSue was, with a more pronounced hop resin and bitterness, which isn't surprising. This is a very good hoppy pale ale and much closer to what I remember than what Brewhub has been putting out as of late. 1,019 charactersStevedore, Jun 03, 2016

Lots of big citrus and tropical aromas.  Orange rind, lemon, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, and tangerine.  Caramel malt, a bit doughy.
Bright citrus flavors.  Orange, tangerine, and lemon.  Malt is light but sorta chewy, caramel-like.  Grapefruit on the finish.  More citrus and less tropical than regular PS.
Medium body with medium carbonation.  Mild citrus bitterness with a bit of an oily feel.  Hints of creaminess.  Orange lingers.
Nice twist on an already outstanding beer.  Massive aroma.  Seems to be more citrusy than regular PS which I find to be a mix of citrus and tropical. 716 charactersleroybrown10, Jun 03, 2016

The taste follows suit and the mouthfeel is just the right amount of creamy and soft. To me this is what NEBCO's Big Fuzzy Double aspires to be - a citra bomb that is refined and softened on the edges. Well done, TG. 752 charactersFireman_RK, Jun 01, 2016

Starks - Prairie du Chien, WI
Bottled: 5/25/16
PseudoSue's double dry hopped brethren glows sunset orange, the sun low in the sky the second you can look at it without burning out your retinas. The moderate cloudiness only amplifies the glow when backlit. The foam on this beer is no joke. A little dirty white with two fingers in height. The side of the glass reads like a history of each drink I've taken with sheet lacing all the way and history lines, thicker yet, where each drink was taken. I have to admit, this is a damn good looking beer!
The nose is pretty outstanding and I don't believe I've come across this concentrated an aroma of Citra in any prior beer. Big jammy orange leads the way before all the tropical take over. This beer simply drips guava nectar and passionfruit, tangerine isn't far behind There's a touch of underripe pineapple on the periphery, I'm surprised there's not more actually. candied grapefruit and orange peel  make their presence known as well. There's even a touch of earthy flint down deep. The malt base is tough to pick out but it's softly sweet and sugar cookie-ish. Excellent!
The flavor profile takes on all that delicious citra as well, accentuated by the dense nose on each drink. Big pungent tropical fruits lead the way, the ones mentioned above. Tangerine plays a big role as well, a big role. Candied citrus peel brings a perceived sweetness while the tropical are more fresh and naturally sweet. That earthy note comes back in the flavor profile but not as flint, more woodsy this time. It's always amazed me the depth and character a good brewer can pull from using only Citra. This beer perfectly showcases that ability.
The mouthfeel is pure luxury. It's moderate in weight with a slickness mid palate through the finish. The body is plush after a prickly carbonation hits upfront. The bitterness rises to moderate throughout the drink and lingers while it dries. There is no stopping the drinkability of this beer. All day long if possible.
Damn, I'm kind of shocked by this beer. PseudoSue is a damn fine beer. Somehow this version is head and shoulders above the original. I don't even like rating beer this high and wanted to ding it everywhere I could, with that said, it's outstanding. Double Dry Hopped PseudoSue is one of the best new beers I have drank in a long while. 2,361 charactersjoe1510, May 30, 2016

Smell: Smells like a 10/5. Best nose on a Pale possible. I think I can still smell it a day later. 
Taste/Feel: Like the best pale ale I've ever had
Overall: The best pale ale I've ever had. Really hope Decorah keeps pumping out Sue and versions of it because this is world class. 329 characters_beerini, May 26, 2016
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Citra, citra, citra!  I know that is one too many citras.  This is even juicier than regular sue.  Amazing job TG.  The best part is it took everything great about (decorah) sue,  mouthfeel, easy drinking, aroma, and cranked up the Citra juiciness. 248 charactersTravitten, May 26, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Was not this excited to try a beer in a while; one day old double dry hopped Sue in a bomber. I might modify this review regardless but so far this is not disappointing. The smell is like normal PsuedoSue on steriods; overwhelming citra hops smell. The taste is like a very rich, layered Sue if that makes any sense. It kinda tastes like the normal Sue but then is a bit different. To me it tastes like it is higher ABV than regular every day Sue but almost goes down a bit more smooth (does not have some of that bitter finish the canned Sue has). Pretty pumped so far; need to get my hands on a King Sue to be able to compare the taste. Have another bomber in the hotel fridge and will see how that one goes down tomorrow. Regular Sue is my go to beer so did not really see anyway that this could be a let down or not be good. 828 charactersWebzombie, May 26, 2016
