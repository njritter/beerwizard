Poured into a goblet, it is a beautiful golden/orange color with a slight haze, and 1 finger of head.  Smells was most stone fruit, peaches, apricots, a bit of lemon.  Big creamy body with the right amount of dryness, acidity (mild), and tart & funk.  I know they price point turns some folks off, but I considered this a treat and a beer I'd probably never have again so $60 seemed well worth it to me.  If I do get another chance to drink this again, I won't hesitate. 566 charactersWayne17, Sep 28, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle at Toronado in San Diego on 5/26/16. 2009 release. 
Appears a vibrant, hazy orange. Aroma is complex with layers of peach, apricot, pear, white grape, lemon, lime... definitely fruit forward tinged with woodsy barrel notes. Flavor is highly complex - this has aged super well. Again there is a melange of stone fruit flavors balanced with tartness and funk and just the right amount of acidity. Very drinkable, yet at the same time it's totally a sipping beer due to the multiple layers of flavor. Smooth and zippy with a pleasing, fine carbonation fully intact.
If forced to choose I would pick this over DDG. 635 charactersRothobinide, May 31, 2016

Taste was very sour, more lemon notes, more clean wood.  Very similar to duck duck gooze.  Hides alcohol well, plenty of carbonation and levity.  Pucker inducing. 
Another very good beer from Lost Abbey, but the scarcity business model is tired and realistically affects a beer score. 383 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 13, 2016

I've heard a lot of comments that Cable Car is good but isn't worth what it takes to land.  I disagree.  It truly lived up to the hype, and was a clear winner and standout in the blind-tasting.
It's slightly hazy with a big body/mouthfeel and perfect carbonation.  Loads of tangerines and mandarin oranges on the nose and taste.  A nice lively and yet soft feel.  Perfect acidity - not overly sour and balances well with the funk, which it had plenty of.
This is certainly a world-class beer, and I'm really happy I opened it rather than "cellaring it to death".  If you have the opportunity to trade for one or try it, I recommend you do. 716 characterspmoney, Dec 11, 2015

Thanks to Nate for the excellent service!
Traveled far and wide to finally try this beauty! Definitely lived up to the hype. Pours a gorgeous gold/orange haze color. The aroma has some nice funk to it, and fresh peaches, taste was nice juicy peaches, citrus, tart, nice acidity and barnyard funk. Very drinkable, could easily down the entire bottle on my own.  Just a wonderful treat! 421 charactersChriscrundwell12, Dec 11, 2015

A: Orange, cloudy with no foam. Orange glints, juicy look.
S: Funky, tart and sour. Barnyard, hay and funk dominate, with also lots of fruits and a mineral scent. Also some lactiness reminding this is an AWA rather than a gueuze.
T: Taste is also tart and funky, with hay, barnyard and horseblanket. Very complex. Not at all one-dimensional as AWAs can sometimes be. The lactiness is there but more subdued and not disturbing. Quite clean actually.
M: Carbonation is ok, the mouthfeel is quite low, though. It could have been more lively.
O: Very good in the style. I did prefer Duck Duck Goose However. 616 charactersFux, Nov 07, 2015

4.96/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I actually thought this one met the hype.  Crazy complex, well done beer.  Hazy, light, very aromatic and the aftertaste kept going in a good way. This was even a 2014 and prob gets better with age.  I had this side by side with 2013 DDG which was also top notch for me this beer was a tad more enjoyable.  I am rating this however with price not in mind.  When I had this next to a 375 ml CD14 it was tough to justify how much I gave up for it.  No regrets definitely nice to have once.  Hard to think any blond sour ale could be better. 538 charactersShogun250, Oct 05, 2015

Smell is of sour oakiness. Taste is of lemony, oakiness with a mild acidity and a moderate sour taste. Does not overpower you with the sourness. Finish is slightly sour with a nice clean finish. I think this may be the best wild ale I have ever had. Bravo!! 352 characterslupercmda, Oct 02, 2015

- Pours a hazy golden yellow, with some lively carb.
- Smells is bright citrus and acid with some mild barnyard funk.
- Flavor hits with juicy and tart peach, acid, oak, some funky hay and a good pucker at the end. Flavors fade from palette pretty quickly, leading the tastebuds to beg for another gulp.
- Nothing over the top here. Not the most funky, most juicy or sour, not the most complex. But it has all the features of a great sour and in beautiful harmony. A pleasure and a treat. Is it worth the price tag? Hard to say... 546 charactersdeschutes_fan, Aug 19, 2015

This has been on my wants list for year and finally got out to SF, didn't expect for bottles to be on sale but splurged. Overpriced at $60 but great beer and glad I had the opportunity to try it. Golden color with minimal head and a bit of haze. Aroma was less intense than expected, vinegar and white wine, decent funk. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Taste is white wine, minimal funk, lemons and bread. Didn't get much oak. Overall great beer, steep price point but would try again if it was $25 or under. 534 charactersirv2424, Jul 24, 2015

At $20-30 a bottle i would recommend all day long.  but at $60 i would say there are many other golden sours out there that are as good or better for half the cost.

Tart upfront. As it warms, bread and cheese characteristics unfold. The finish is similar to a medium bodied oaked Chardonnay. For an AWA it is nice, but no where near as complex as Belgium lambics. Glad I didn't trade for this, doesn't justify it's "price" 285 charactersiSkiCO, Jun 22, 2015

This beer is really a treat. Its just the perfect American take on a classic Belgian Stye. It tasted like sour cherry lemonade. Hints of barnyard funk that were buried under the strong lemon tartness mixed with the perfect hint of cherry sourness. The oak provided an unbelievable barrel character that tied the beer together. It's truly a special beer 520 charactersBrotherDylan, Feb 11, 2015

Aroma of funky notes with clearly identifiable sour notes with some acidic notes also noticeable is quite intense. Taste is also dominated by funky notes with some sharp sour notes, quite a bit of acidity and a short finale. Body is about average with good carbonation. I get what they are trying to do and I also get why people enjoy this but in my opinion while this is a great beer there is a lack of balance and too much acidity in the end. 514 charactersPhyl21ca, Jan 09, 2015

Smell: vinegar, lemon acidity, white wine grapes, weak funkiness. 
Taste: opens up with lemon, along with some other citruses floating in. white wine sweetness and grapes. some grainy to wheaty tastes in the middle. the end is strong on the vinegar and some funk. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied. sourness is there but never overpowering. 
Overall: maybe I have odd taste in sour beers, but this one certainly doesn't blow me away. it tastes good is well done but I don't understand what sets this apart from hundreds of other sours. 666 charactersSportsandJorts, Dec 22, 2014

Appearance - Gold colour with an average size white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some fair lacing. The head lasted for around 4-5 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Breads/grains, lemons, vinegar
Taste & Mouth - There is an above average amount of carbonation and I can taste breads/grains, vinegar, tart lemons - both the juice and the zest.  Also some hay/straw/funky notes and a bit of a peppery spice mix.
Overall - One of the most balanced beers within this style I have had so far.  Very drinkable and extremely tasty.  Happy I had the chance to try it. 666 charactersspinrsx, Dec 19, 2014

4.76/5  rDev +5.8%Poured into a SP Stem. Thanks Shea for busting this out.  CC '13.
A - Cloudy light straw yellow pour with a 1 finger white foam head that slowly recedes back into the glass. 
S - Lemony citrus zest here, slightly reminds me of DDG on the nose here. White wine grapes. The Lemony citrus and grapes smells are the most prevalent.
T - Taste follows the nose here with loads of lemony citrus zesty notes followed by the white grape tastes as well as notes from the oak barrels.
M - Crisp, light, medium bodied and to the point, clean.
O - This reminded me a lot of DDG. If I had to choose between the two, considering the difficulty of obtaining CC, I would have to go with DDG. They are both on par in terms of taste, but the difficulty pushes me away. 755 charactersdrmcleod10, Sep 07, 2014

2008 vintage, C&C 750ml bottle. 
A: Pours a cloudy straw yellow under a 1/2-inch thick white head which fades quickly to the rim leaving a few spots of lace.
S: Puckering lemony zest and tannic oak with some vinous notes. Slightly dusty antique age.
T: Follows nose with bright tannins and citrus zest, vinous, must/funk, mellow barnyard bite. 
M: Moderate body and semi-medium carbonation. Finishes zesty, tart, and tannic.
O: Such a treat and what a surprise. Amazed this is holding up so well. A wonderful wild ale. Only minor flaw is the lack of complexity. 633 characterswethorseblanket, Jul 19, 2014

4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a hazy bright straw yellow.
The aroma has funky hay, apricot, dried peach, and a decent tartness.
The flavor follows of tart lemons, stone fruit and nectarine, onto a medium minus malt backbone with a medium hay funk. There's a drying and tart quality in the back.
This is up there with the best gueuze I've had. It definitely holds back on the funk unlike Drie Fonteinen and Cantillon, but has a wonderful complexities and restraint. 455 charactersdar482, Jun 30, 2014

4.58/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75750ml bottle of the 2010 vintage. Poured into a FFF/DMC taster 6/21/2014. 
A- Hazy straw yellow body, cloudy and with a half finger white head. Good retention though it does become completely still-looking after a few minutes. Not much lacing. Looks very, very similar to Duck Duck Gooze.
S- Lemon zest, tart citrus, musty oak, white wine grapes, crackers, a little tart apple skin. Some vinegar. Smells so strong and aggressive, particularly the lemon and white grape must.
F- Similar to the nose. Lemon zest, white vinous grapes, musty oak, a bit of funky cheesiness. Tart apple skins add a little bit of depth. Vinegar is about 7/10, nicely sour but not abrasively so. This is very good, not complex but again, this is quite aggressive. 
M- Medium in body, a bit creamy but certainly not custardy. About the right amount of carbonation, a nice pop to it. Lemon sourness on the backend makes for a nice cleansing finish.
O- Very aggressive but not as complex as Duck Duck Gooze is. In my mind, this beer is somewhere in between Beat and DDG on the spectrum of AWAs- aggressive but with a solid layer of complexity that's done very well with time. This one did not disappoint, though it's still a long-standing philosophical question as to whether it is worth what it requires to obtain a bottle of this. While I would recommend going after Duck Duck Gooze or Beatification instead of this one, please don't get me wrong- this is an excellent AWA.
Re-review: 2009 vintage of Cable Car. Served in a stemmed glass 4/30/2016. Drinking this alongside a 2009 Duck Duck Gooze was a revelation. Both of these beers have aged quite well compared to their fresher components. This is still a well-rounded, aggressive wild ale, with a similar profile but more of ground peppercorn is there on the finish. Lemon and citrus, no green apple skin. Good complexity, nice oak and mellow dusty funk to it. This vintage seems to be a particularly good one or it just does well with time- may be a sign not to drink these too young. 2,020 charactersStevedore, Jun 22, 2014

A - Nothing exciting. Plain-jane, honey colored juice with little trace of bubbles or froth.
S - Trace oak, and the age makes itself known. Not quite sawdust but more of a musty, weathered note. Vinegar, flora, champaign. Maybe a bit herbaceous. Bacteria is still kicking in some manure.
T - White wine, bitter unripened fruit adding to acidity, slightly acetic, plentiful oak tannins. It's missing balance with neither clean nor sweet fruit notes. 
M - Very good. Lengthy finish, very dry, carbonation way more acceptable than it looked like it'd be.
D - It's lost some character over 6 years and not made up for it with sour development. Whereas Beatification is explosive and overbearing and DDG is fresh and focused, I find this sitting somewhere in the middle. 885 charactersAuracom, Apr 28, 2014

Served chilled in a wine glass. 
2013 Vintage. 
A massive thanks to Futura123 for this bottle. 
Appearance: Cable Car pours a lightly clouded golden orange with a rough pour yielding a large white head. The head lasts well for a sour and leaves a few patches of lacing as it recedes. 
Smell: The initial nose is quite different from what I had expected with a big overripe fruit character (white grapes and maruls) . After a few minutes the nose begins to open up with a fair amount of acidity, some musty notes, tart white grape, lemon, sweeter peach and orange, old wood, a light lactic character and some mold becoming apparent. 
Taste: The flavour seems a little cleaner than the nose suggested, with far less of the overripe fruit character as well as a nice tartness and a fantastic acidity. Notes include: Tart white grapes, white wine, some sweeter stone fruits, a touch of cider vinegar, lemon, lactic, some oak, a minerally note and some old hay. 
Mouthfeel: Initially the carbonation is a little too much for me (high level and quite expansive), but thankfully it settles down to a more pleasant level fairly quickly. The body has a little more heft than most wild ales at a light-medium level. 
Overall: Cable Car is a great American Wild Ale, but as with so many beers it is no where near the hype. I wonder how the earlier vintages compare to the 2013. 1,396 charactersThehuntmaster, Jan 17, 2014

Pours a clear light peach color with almost one finger of white head. Head dissipates pretty quickly, but maintains a thin collar. Aromas of white grape, brett, light peach and mild funk. Funk is more pronounced in the taste, but is still on the mild side, with nice brett presence. Tart without being overly sour, with a nice white wine aspect to the taste, along with citrus, peach and nectarine. Quite easy drinking. Finish is tart and semi-dry. Mouthful is medium/light with a bit of creaminess. Nice carbonation level. I think I like DDG a bit more, but this is an excellent American wild. 618 characterswarnerry, Jan 15, 2014

Nose has very faint barrel with hints of acetic acid, notes of leathery bret and orange peel with a nice vinous quality. Taste is very drinkable, sour white grape skins and citrus with hints of oak and vanilla. Faint leathery bret and a touch of citrus towards the back of the palate. Lighter body and strong carbonation (shocking) with a dry and lightly sour finish. Very delicate flavors and pretty well done. 459 characterscpetrone84, Jan 05, 2014

A big thanks to her for scoring me a 2013 vintage of this. This beer poured out as a hazy orange gold color with a foamy white head on top. Lots of bubbles rising to the top and collecting at the surface to hold a strong retention. Decent lacing streaks down the glass with every sip. The smell of the beer is potent, it's pretty funky and rank. Basically it stinks but it's awesome for the style, it's exactly how I would expect it to smell. The taste of the beer has a sharp tartness up front which then settles into a really nice sweet grainy wheat like finish. This beer is very bold yet delicate in flavor, it's hard to explain. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a solid carbonation. The beer is very drinkable. Overall this is definitely something special and I believe it's worth seeking out at least once. I'd love to drink it again one day but I don't want to drop the money on it like I did for this one. 1,030 charactersKnapp85, Jan 03, 2014

A- Deep golden color. Medium transparency, 1/4 finger lacing with medium retention. 
S- Lemons, funk, yeasty goodness. 
T- This is a really smooth sour. I have had better sours; perhaps I should have kept this one in the cellar for a couple years. This is also my first CC. I prefer DDG. Just preference. I get yeast&gt;brett funk&gt;lemon&gt;then there is some starch product I get.
M- Very smooth. Great mouthfeel. Goes down smooth with bubbles following. 
O- I think this is good, not great. I have the whole vert, so maybe if I popped open the '09 I would get a religious experience, but not yet from the '13. 668 charactersgueuzedreg, Nov 29, 2013

2009 vintage.
Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, fruit, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour and tart fruit-like flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and very easy to drink. 597 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 28, 2013

The smell is sharply acidic with not to much funk and hints of apple. Flavor follows suit with a lot of acidity but not to much else going on. The mouthfeel is low carbonation highly puckering. Overall this is a very tasty sour just kind of one dimensional and under carbed, not worth what a lot if people trade. 420 charactersrowingbrewer, Oct 20, 2013

750 ml bottle served in a Lost Abbey Teku glass. 2012 vintage generously shared by kevanb, thanks Kevan! 
A: Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head forming on the pour. A thin white head forms on the pour and recedes to a thick wispy ring.
S: Lactic and lemony. Minimal funky notes. Some straw with some lemon grass. Tart and slightly acidic. White grape notes and stone fruit flesh.
T: The taste pairs pretty with the nose, although the sourness gets amped up a bit. Nice little pucker with some great fruitiness. Lemon grass with a minimal tartness. Lactic sweetness. Sweet oak notes with a nice light fruity flesh presence. Vibrant stone fruit notes.
M: Light bodied with a great, lively carbonation. A little jowl pucker with the sourness. Dry finish.
O: Delicate, but vibrant. Delicious American Wild. The fruity notes that came out were great despite no fruit being added. Thanks again to Kevan for sharing. 937 charactersTreebs, Jul 14, 2013
4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle, 2012 vintage, poured into a Lost Abbey sinners teku glass, shared with friends. 
The beer pours a cloudy apricot color with a soapy white head that recedes quickly, leaving a few bubbles atop the beer, yielding a light amount of sticky lace. The aroma is lovely, lots of fresh, fleshy fruit, white grapes, light oak, pale grain, light funk and a healthy dose of acetic sour character. Fleshy fruit jumps out on the tongue, apricot, peach, nectarine with a great layer of tart white grape, chewy oak, funk with some light straw and just enough acetic sour quality to really pucker me up. The body is lively with high carbonation that really dances on the tongue. It coats the mouth well and has a lightly creamy finish with a little pickle as it goes down. 
Verdict: A remarkable sour from The Lost Abbey that rivals anything being made in America currently. The fruit characteristics of this beer are remarkable and while it lacks slightly in funk and barnyard character, it is really a well rounded and balanced sour. 1,034 characterskevanb, Jul 13, 2013

Appearance - Pours a hazy golden body with the briefest of white heads. Nary a collar as it settles.
Smell - Fruity acidity. Some malt and oak. Fruit is like a light grape, white wine aroma.
Taste - Sweeter than I expected. Oak is strong. White wine notes all over. Lactic sourness. Malty.
Mouthfeel - Medium heavy body. Medium carbonation. Oaky and moderate sourness.
Overall - Not a complex sour, but very well made. More than the sum of its parts. 505 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 09, 2013

A: Pours a dark apricot color with a thin white head that disappears almost immediately. 
S: Smells really incredible. Juicy red apples mixed with tart green apples and a noticeable acidity. Vanilla, lemon curd and apple pie filling as well.
T: Pretty sour right away with a big lemon warhead kick. Layers of unripe green apple and sour red cherry and just a touch of funk. Finish leaves just a touch of dryness on the tongue with a lingering sourness. Tight, prickly carbonation works perfectly in here. 570 charactersnotchucknorris, May 28, 2013

Score: 99
2012 vintage bottle served in an Upland snifter and enjoyed on 05/18/13 side-by-side with a bottle of 2010 Duck Duck Goose as part of our Chicago Craft Beer Week whales tasting. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Pours a dull golden-orange color with a thin layer of fizzy head that settles to a ring around the glass. No lacing or retention. Average golden ale-like appearance 3.5/5
Smell: Lactobacillus, vinegar, lemon, mango and a hint of tart apples. Has an imitation "Cantillon dust"-like aroma that I absolutely dig. Light fruitiness. Acidic nose. White grape too. 5/5
Taste: Mango, lemon, lacto and acidic grape. Very tart and dry. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Light-medium bodied, perfect carbonation. Big in flavor, quite tart. Juicy on the palate, dry on the finish. 5/5
Overall: Absolutely love this beer. It's bold, zesty and tart, while not being very funky. In this regard, it is my ideal sour. It could be more complex, but this brew absolutely delivers in what it brings to the table
Cost: $40 for a 750 ml bottle. 1,234 charactersjegross2, May 02, 2013

Thanks kindly for sharing 2 vintages! side-by-side tasting of 2007 and 2010 from lost abbey tekus. BIGGEST WANT at the time of this taste!!! review numbers are based on my impressions of the 10.
a - the 07 is orange and the 10 has more of a yellow tint with a thin foamy head. 10 is definitely more lively and has a nice foamy head whereas the 07 was a bit more lifeless...even when the 07 was opened there was barely a pop. the 10 has some nice streaky lacing too.
s - 07 is way funky smelling whereas the 10 is funk, but with a glazing of fruitiness and some sweet tarts.
t - 2010 is crisp, clean. some funky sourness. the 07 is good as well, but more subdued and smoother over. the 07 has less funk and tartness. good fruit all around, the 10 has a bigger flavor profile.
m - 07 is way smooth whereas the 10 has a nice pucker.
o - overall, this was my personal whale and it lived up to my expectations. it is definitely a bit one dimensional, but i really like that dimension so we're good. 1,220 characterscosmicevan, Dec 06, 2012

A: Pours a very bright golden color, very clear. No head formation or lacing, but carbonation bubbles release from the bottom of the glass. 
S: Very nice aroma, lots of citrus fruits, some apricot, peach, and green apple. A sharp sour/acetic aroma, very inviting. 
T: Fantastic flavor profile, has held up nicely over the years. A great acetic sourness, very puckering. Vibrant lemon, apple, peach, and apricot. 
M: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A great level of sourness. 
O: A fantastic AWA that has held up nicely, though not sure how much longer it will hold out. Thankful I was able to give this one a try. 702 charactersmdaschaf, Nov 03, 2012

4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750 mL 2007 ed batch 1. This is very different from the 2009 version, which I like much better. Batch 1 has held up very well but has become more like white wine and is more sour and full of white grapes. It is bright with citrus/lemon acidity, which shares almost no commonalities with the 2009. 6/10/2010 8/4/8/5/15=4.0
750mL 2009 ed batch 3 courtesy of ucusty. There were tons of hyped beers at our Carolina sour tasting- many of them did not live up it. But this certainly did. Pours just a beautiful glowing, hazy light orange/yellow with a thin white head that leaves some spotty lace. Aroma is simply incredible: pineapple, coconut rum, papaya, cotton candy (fairly sweet) layered atop geuze notes of leather, funk, tart apples, lemon zest. Taste is sour with lacto and pedo plus a rich array of tropical fruits and a bit of spicy alcohol. Nice sweet and sour mix. Buttery, rich palate. Light to medium bodied. Just whoa. 3/23/2010 9/4/9/5/17=4.4
750mL 2010 ed batch 4 at Toronado SD. Pours a fizzy, clear, white wine color with a diminishing, bubbly white head. Moves tyo muddy, glowing orange with the yeast. Aroma is sharp geuze funk, green apple skins, lemon, key lime, moving to some really incredible sweet complexity akin to baba rhum and marzipan. Taste is soft lactic, very easy to drink with a quick, sharp sour beginning moving to long, lactic beauty. It is almost like glorified Berliner weiss it is so soft and not slap your face sour like some geuzes. Maybe a bit too much lemon. No acedic comes forth that I find with the Veritas 007. Great cotton candy character develops at it warms. 10/10/10 9/4/8/5/16=4.2
750mL 2010 ed b4 at Toronado SF. The pour is a bright yellow with a medium, white head that leaves incredibly sticky lace. Pretty much a 5/5 for sour beer where the near zero sugar content makes it tough for lace to stick. Aroma of cotton candy, caramel, pink lemonade, sour/acetic impeding funk, fresh grapefruit, lemon, and acetic spice reminiscent of Hanssen’s Gueuze, funky white wine. Taste is incredibly soft, not truly sour as much fresh and tart. Bretty earth comes into play atop a beer that exhibits a sweet and sour play on the tongue that is hard to describe with sufficiency. Fresh caramel and sweet oranges take center stage rather than lemon or vinegar. What a perennial treat. 2/4/2011 9/5/8/5/16=4.3 2,353 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

4.05/5  rDev -10%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42008 bottle opened at our Lost Abbey tasting. Poured into a tasting snifter.
Appearance: Pours a clear amber color with a golden hue. The is a small amount of off white head.
Smell: A slight tartness with some lemon and a mildly herbal funk. There is more sweetness here than I expected.
Taste: A tartness that reminds me of lemon juice with some vinegar in there as well. Slightly bitter, I'm getting some aged hops. The finish is light and sour.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with tingly carbonation and a touch of dryness in the finish.
Overall: This is a very good beer, but it was missing that wow factor for me. Still quite nice and I wouldn't turn down more. 663 charactersoline73, Jul 13, 2012

2007 bottle:
A - bright, crisp golden body with a quarter-inch of white head on top. Pretty decent lacing after a small swirl. 
S - tons of funk, citrus and oak. Really nice nose on this one. Grass, maybe some horse blanket action, oranges and a light hint of cherry or raspberry perhaps?
T - wow, really sour and full of oak and citrus. This is my first time trying the CCs and I can see where their hype comes from. Very tart and dry with a puckering finish, yet the fruit nuances are still there. 
M - sour, tart, puckering and dry. Awesome!
O - this beer is something else. Each vintage was different and special in its own way, but I'd say the '07 or '09 were the tops. I'm honestly surprised to see how well these are holding up and think they could go shoulder to shoulder with any of the Loons or 3F out there. 941 charactersGabrielM, Jul 10, 2012

A - Brownish golden hue. Bubbles dissipate quickly but there is a ton of bubbles that stick to the inside of the glass inside the beer.
S - The oak and vinuous character really stand out up front. Light lemon also intermingles.
T - There is plenty of oak up near the front. The lemony tartness follows on the back and and cuts through the middle of my tongue.
M - Very champagne-y on the tongue, despite being from 2008. The bubbles help the drinkability of the beer. 
O - An extremely solid American wild. May not be super fair to put this up against everything else. It doesn't fall short, per se. It's a very very good sour. 713 charactersraveskdr, Jul 02, 2012

Toronado
San Diego, CA
(Aged for 2.5 years)
Tasted side-by-side with the 2008 and 2010 vintages.
A bright, clear mixture of gold, yellow, and orange with a nicely-sized off-white head that doesn't last for long. This doesn't leave any cling on the glass, though this is indeed a nice looking beer.
This is a complete, wonderfully smelling American wild. There is lots of bright citrus (orange, tangerine, mango, and lemon) along with big levels of acidic sourness. There's some moderate funk complementing everything nicely. Very, very nice.
The flavor follows the aroma similarly, with lots of tangerine, lemon, and mango flavors, backed up by a high level of tart sourness, and mild barnyard funk. Complete and delicious, though not quite as complex as the very best within the style.
Medium bodied with moderate/high carbonation. A joy to drink.
Simply fantastic.
2008 Tasting Notes (Aged for 3.5 years):
Very little carbonation. No head, no cling. Less sour and less fruit flavors when compared to both 2009 and 2010 versions. Heavy, lifeless body. Easily, the weakest of our lineup.
2010 Tasting Notes (Aged 1.5 years):
Similar carbonation and appearance to 2009. More funk than fruit and not quite as sour as the 2009. 1,248 charactersehammond1, May 17, 2012

**Scores are reflected for 2009 Vintage below**
App- Really a nice looking sour. A good mix of colors in the glass. A balance of a medium orange with some yellows and golds running throughout. Nicely carbonated as when the bottle was popped the bubbles started to creep out. Good bubble activity, a nice head and still no cling.
Smell- Very alive on the nose. Had a nice brightness with a good vibrant citrus. A bit of orange, tangerine was present. Nice burn on the big whiffs of some acidity and booze.
Taste- The bite is more pronounced on the flavor. A large sour pucker note with a bit of balanced tartness and wheaty lemon. The balance is much more present and this bottle seems to have done wonders.
Mouth- A light medium body with a fairly high prickly carbonation. A nice blending on the residual flavors of the sour and citrus more so than 08/10
Drink- Consensus of the 5 of us, that this was the best vintage. As mentioned, more alive and bright with a pleasant sour vs. funk combo.
---
2008 Vintage
App- A very deep deep golden color. A bit flat and thick looking like a mix of syrup and water. Zero cling and bubbles formed at all. (3.0)
Smell- A small impish bit of lemon on this one. Probably had the most deep smell of being old really. A small balanced acid on this nose. No fruit compared to other vintages (3.5)
Taste- Had a good flavor but could tell was past its prime. Seems like when the flavors fall you are left with just a nice base sour that plays well with adding layers of flavors too. A bit lemon remains with a bit of tart. (3.5)
Mouth- A bit thicker leading to a medium/full thickness for a sour. A low carbonation level with zero bubbles remaining. A bit of a lemon flavor remains. (3.0)
Drink- It was okay. A bit old but still retained a nice flavor. Fair to say this is past its prime at this point. (3.5)
2010 Vintage
App- This was a fuller yellow vs. 09 which had a good blend of colors. A bit light than 09 and much more than 08. A bit less bubbles than 09 as well. Still no cling though. (4.0)
Smell- This had me and the guys comparing Motherfunker vs. Filmismish while drinking these too. Its the story of Sour vs. Funk. This was the funky one of the two. Had a deeper earthy note behind it. A bit more wheat IMO. (4.0)
Taste- Smaller sour with a more pronounced funk flavor. Had much less of a bite as well. A bit more mango flavor to get to a much more rich flavor. (4.5)
Mouth- A lighter medium body with a medium carbonation. A bit of residual funk/earthy flavors. Much more tart vs. sour. (4.0)
Drink- Very tasty and much creamier than the 09. I can see this one aging very well. (4.5) 2,794 charactersFosterJM, May 17, 2012

Pours a hazy golden color with a thick white head, not much lacing.
Smells like tangy fruit, citrus and lemon zest. Lots of grapefruit, orange, nectarine and funk. Similar to a Belgian gueuze, delightful funk but not out of control.
Tastes like those chalky Vitamin C tablets with graham cracker sweetness and tart on the finish. Grapefruit, orange, lemon is prominent. I thought it would be a lot more sour from the nose, but it's has incredible balance with some oak and vanilla.
Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and rich for a sour beer.
This was incredible. I'm glad to have skipped the line at Churchill's for this. This is a great sour with lots of citrusy complexity and a great mouthfeel. 732 charactersislandboi8204, Mar 08, 2012

2009 vintage.
A - Hazy peach color with frothy white head. Produces rocky lace.
S - Light and airy at first. With a bit of warmth and time to breathe it opens into a bright spring bloom aroma. There's a lot of wonderful funk there coming from an American brewer. So many Wilds have the sourness but lack the funk.
T - There's a lovely tartness here paired with citric sweetness. Lemon and nectarine lend a fruity profile to this wild. Leaves a bitter finish. Grows very acidic over time.
M - Great carbonation, a lively brew, no doubt.
O - What an excellent beer. People say that this is the best year so far though - I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to try this. The thing is, as good as Cable Car proves to be, it's really not necessarily any better than the readily available Russian River sours that sit on shelves within their range of distribution. With this in mind, Cable Car is a beer that lives up to the praise, but not the hype. 1,041 charactersSpider889, Feb 08, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Finally got around to trying this one. Into a mini Chimay Chalice.
Cable car has a very light appearance, the liquid appears thin and the color is a dull faded yellow with a smidgen of foam here and there, barely breaking the surface, mini streaks.
Smell is bold with a lot of fruit mixed in with horse blanket funk and hay. Lemon is by far the biggest scent I can sniff out, along with traces of pale malt. No sweetners to dull it down, nice. Not picking up any of that egg/sulfer scent that peeps were talking about.
Taste is up front with bold lemon and various similar fruit. The horseblanket/funk/wet hay is pronounced yet not over the top. Lactic sourness is there and I love it. Get some white grape taste in the end, with everything coming back together. To me, CC holds some similarities to an aged 750ML bottle of Cuvee De Castleton.
Feel is mad thin and dry which is what I look for in a great sour, so this is a winner in that arena. Bright carbonation with a lactic/lemon aftertaste and slight pale malt. I could drink a ton.
At the Alcohol level, a whole bottle of this would be a sinch to a sour lover, alas, thats never going to happen. Lost Abbey sure can brew some sours and CC is no slouch 1,213 charactersBARFLYB, Jan 29, 2012

Pours bright, hazy, yellow with a nice big head that settles into a lasting foam cap.
More funky in the aroma than the others, and less fruit character, but it's still there. Phenolic brett, stone fruit, citrus zest, tangy berry.
The citrus and peachy nectarine are still present, but they are either less prominent or I am starting to experience some palate fatigue. The main flavors are there though. Underripe peaches, various citrus peels and segments, sour candy, and phenolic brett. Slightly less refined and focused than the 2008 and 2009, but still damn good.
Good mouthfeel. Not quite as fantastic as the 2009, but more full and rich than the 2008.
This is Cable Car, and it's great. Tasting it after the 2008 and 2009, it's not my favorite, but as a sour beer it's still world class and something for brewers to aspire to. 850 charactersMrFootstones, Dec 21, 2011

Pours a relatively clear golden copper color with a nice white head that hangs around and leaves light rings of lacing. Aroma is surprisingly funky and complex with lemon and green apple sourness dominating. More fruit and tart than earthiness but there is light straw and grass throughout as well. Body is very citric and crisp, full on the palate with high carbonation. Flavor start with lemon and other citrus rind, before becoming more oaky and tart with only lingering sourness. Expected to be let down by this, but was pleasantly surprised and look forward to trying other vintages. 625 charactersyourefragile, Dec 20, 2011

Beautiful, glowing golden beer with a flawless nose, taste, and mouthfeel. An absolute perfect sour that I recommend trying as soon as possible. It's improved since I had it when new, but I struggle to imagine it getting any better with more time, mainly because I can't imagine any sour, and maybe any beer, tasting better than this.
I've never had anything perfect. But this was. 411 charactersdrgarage, Dec 13, 2011

A: Poured into my tulip the beer is golden yellow and moderately clear. Huge three fingers of white head fill the glass and remain. Good retention with modest lace. 
S: Loads of tart and sweet intertwined with a good dose of brett. Mild funk. Just a bit of wood and attic dust. Mostly just awesome sweet and tart fruit. 
T: Pleasantly tart citric fruit. Dry bretty band aid. A good amount of juicy citrus sour on the finish. 
M: Medium body with loads of carbonation. 
O: Fantastic! Well worth the price tag and visit to Toronado. I managed to share about 6 ounces with my wife and I honestly regretted letting that much get away. 675 charactersbeerwolf77, Nov 28, 2011

I'm grateful to the whomever brought this to the tasting and hope to have another opportunity to try this again as well as buy the person a drink. Clear fairly dark orange with a thin film of head on an aggressive pour. Light lacing on the glass when, but it slid quickly back into the glass, with only a few bubbles here and there. 
Aroma was very balanced but complex, green apples, white wine vinegar, white grape sweetness, pears, light floral and earthiness and some funkiness as it warmed up. 
Follows the nose nicely, sharp acidity at first from the vinegar like flavors, but just a nice fruitiness mid palate, green apple sweetness and tartness, sweet pears, light stone fruits, floral and a bit of wet soil earthiness. Finish was dry, with some lingering fruitiness, long enough to be satisfying without being too funky. 
Light body with minimal carbonation, a slight prick of a bubble here and there, but expected for a wild ale. Very easy to drink but one to savor with how nice it is at two years old. Hopefully Toronado still has a 2010 bottle available when my birthday approaches in a few weeks as I was hoping to go open one then. Excellent beer. 1,202 charactersnataku00, Nov 21, 2011

A: Cloudy, golden color with foamy white head and solid lace. Remains hazy as it warns, unlike the 2010.
S: Strong Brettt yeast character melds with sour fruit and bready notes. Among the best sour aromas I've had the pleasure of experiencing.
T: Fruits, oak, and Brett share the spotlight. Great blend of the three flavors. When cool, it leaves a lingering bitterness; however, after warming, its bone dry finish lingers with fruit and oak, bitterness be damned. Not sure quite why that is, but I like it.
M: Body is thin and weak, yet nicely oily. Hard to enjoy this brew's mouthfeel after the massive creaminess of the '11 Kriek.
D: Sessionable, even at $40/bottle. Although to be honest, I won't be ordering this again while there's still an available stock of '11 Kriek. Cheers! 887 charactersbrystmar, Nov 13, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.52009 vintage. Graciously shared by Drazzamatazz. 750ml bottle, poured into an Allagash glass
A: There was only a small pop when opening the bottle. Tangerine colored. Pours with a minimal amount of head. Translucent at first, but became cloudy with the second pour (dregs)
S: Citrusy, squeezed lemons, sweet tarts. Initially I didn't get a lot of funk (it was musty if anything), but as it opened up there was a cheesy/horse blanket aroma to signal the funk had arrived
T: Fairly lemony. Reminded me of the white sweet tarts right after you eat them. Lemon rind, apricot, maybe even some oak. Pretty sour, nice level of funkiness
M: Medium bodied. Lower carbonation, which ultimately I was fine with. Dry finish
D: What can I say, this was a great beer. Very happy to have finally tried it. At first I didn't get it, but the beer eventually showed me what was up. Seek out if you like sours 895 charactersBrez07, Nov 09, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From 750mL bottle to stemmed wine glass at Toronado San Diego on 11/1/11. What better way to celebrate my 30th birthday then with my #1 want.
Vintage 2010
A: Like fine champagne, it's a beautiful pale 14k gold. A gentle pour yields a white 1.25 head that fizzes down to nil within moments. A surprising amount of thin, white lacing rims the glass.
S: Mild brett, which doesn't overwhelm the beer. Hints of honey, ripe green apples, medium char, a touch of white grape and lemon rind. Spectacular.
T: Unlike any Wild Ale I've had, as the balance here is unmatched. The fore comes across like a Brut Cava. As it hits the mid, the brett sneaks up and washes over the palate. And it's at this point where the beer really shows it's finesse. This is where most brett brews simply can't overcome the wild yeast. But Cable Car is unlike those said ales. Instead, the brett passes the mid and rounds into a crisp, dry finish that showcases the lightly toasted, charry oak. Without question, this is one of the top five beers I've tasted.
M: Superb. It's not too light as many in-style can be. Rather, it's creamy and textured, yet it packs a really bubbly and lively layer of carbonation.
O: Lost Abbey's Cable Car comes about as close to perfect as any brew I've ever encountered. It does everything right, with not only ease, but a deft touch. Absolutely worthy of the epic hype and them some. This brewing masterpiece easily receives my highest recommendation. Happy 30th to me! 1,479 charactersRhettroactive, Nov 01, 2011

Appearance: This has a nice hazy golden yellow color with a great compressed creamy off-white head.
Smell: The aroma is sour and funky. Lemon rind, peach, apricot, and grapefruit provide the fruity tartness, with a lot of great barnyard funk and hay.
Taste: Light pale malt flavor, and a flood of fruity sour notes. Apricot, peach, lemon zest, and some grapefruit toward the end. Lots of lactic sourness, a bit of oak, and some vinegar create a full sour flavor.
Mouthfeel: This is tart and quite acidic. Medium body with crisp carbonation. Lactic and vingeary.
Overall: The flavor is great and sour throughout, and each flavor note is so robust, I really enjoyed this beer. 794 charactersKickInTheChalice, Oct 31, 2011

(A)- Pours a clear orange color. Some white froth and lace.
(S)- A great fruity oak barrel character. An awesome acidic sourness to it as well. Some serious lemon rind in this.
(T)- Again, a great barrel oak character. Fruity, but in a strictly acidic sense. Very mild funk, but some great lemon rind and white grape fruit sour parts.
(M)- A nice carbonation level and balance. I like the acidity on this alot. The fruit is good too; even the funk. Overall, the barrel characters are very well done.
(D)- Honestly, this is a great wild ale. Worth the hype? maybe, but definitely not worth the difficulty in getting a bottle outside of Toronado; glad i didnt have to. 782 characterssweemzander, Oct 29, 2011

Bottle as part of epic sour tasting with callmemimckey. 
2009 750mL bottle pours slightly hazy dark gold, decent white head.

T: Simple, but good. Sour sweeps into apple core earthiness. Interesting rustic bitterness... in general, it reminds me of Cantillon Gueuze without the overwhelming acidity. Good.

S - The aroma is an inviting mix of sour and tart white grape and other fruit flavors. There is also some oak and vanilla as well as a nice mix of funkiness. This is one of the best smelling beers I have ever had period.
T - The beer starts off with a great mix of sour and tart white grapeish flavor. It is quite strong but not too overpowering. The oak flavor jumps in right after and starts to mellow things out a bit. By the middle of the beer, everything feels much more balanced with some vanilla and good funkiness coming through. The finish is bit again on the sour and tart with some good funkiness that linger for a while.
M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. The beer felt very smooth with a great mix of sour and tart throughout.
D - Very drinkable. The sour and tart flavors are outstandingly balanced from start to end here. It was really a pleasure to drink this beer, regardless of the price since I felt it was really that good. 1,133 charactersngeunit1, Aug 28, 2011

Really dry and funky. Some hay and horse blanket with a hint of leather.
The nose is nice, the taste is really good. It is really dry, which I like. Some soft light fruit notes come through before a wallop of tart sourness cleans it up on the back end.
The body is good, light and airy but possibly a bit overcarbed.

Pours a very hazy, dark yellow with a tiny head. On the nose I get peach, grape skin, vanilla and some oak. Initially, the taste is juicy midway through then drops off to a very tart finish. I also pick up tangerine, orange, and lemon zest. This one is very drinkable with little notice to 7% abv.

4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52007 bottle. Big thanks to Gtreid for the share, and to mikesgroove for trading this bottle to him in the first place. The brew pours a radiant golden hue and is capped with a filmy white head. My glass is quite translucent due to a careful pour. The nose is very nice, although slightly too understated for me; lemon, green apple skin, cut grass and tannic oak are the mainstay of the aroma, and it is quite similar to a mild Hanssen's Gueuze in smell. The flavor ramps up the complexity and intensity relative to the aroma, and the result is outstanding. Perfect tartness, notes of lemon juice and zest, kaffir lime, nectarine, green apple, general acidity and woody notes are observed on the palate. The feel is very smooth whilst retaining tooth, and has an unbelievably clean finish. Overall I am very impressed. Worthy of the hype. Better than DDG. Almost as good as IP. I cannot yet make a YB comparison. 911 charactersktrillionaire, Jul 11, 2011

It was worth every single penny! 2009 Vintage at San Francisco Toronado. Pours a light, golden-amber color with a medium white head. The carbonation is looking quite delightful on this beer. Scent is very funky with some intense lactic sour notes. As the beer warms the fruit really comes out. I get some sweet pear aromas, along with peach and apricot. The taste is out of this world... I went into this with high expectations, and I was not let down! Mouth puckering! Much more sour than expected. There are some sweet pear flavors with lemon and a close resemblance to Sweet Tarts candy. Mouthfeel is extremely dry and puckering on the inside of my cheeks, tongue, and roof of my mouth. Drinkability is high, as this beer is just so damn tasty! Overall, I'm just very happy this beer did not disappoint. It exceeded in all aspects. Good job Lost Abbey! 911 charactersDovaliHops, Jul 07, 2011

Reviewed from Notes
This beer pours a fantastic bright hazy yellow/golden/orange color with a fluffy white head. This is a beautiful looking beer. Leaves minimal lacing. The aroma is very fruit forward being dominated by peaches, apricot, green apple, and citrus (lemon). This beer is incredibly aromatic. The smell just explodes out of this beer. The taste is very dry and tart and follows the smell. Peaches and apricots are present, and the tart sourness very much enhances the flavor. The taste gets better with every sip. This beer goes down almost too easy, it was gone long before I was ready to let it go. The body is light and has a nice amount of carbonation. 
Overall this is a fantastic sour. Each sip is more enjoyable all the way to the end of the bottle. Very aromatic and fruity, but not sweet. Drinking amazingly right now. The sour interacts perfectly with the fruity taste. 963 characterscodynevels, Jul 06, 2011

A: Hazy golden yellow color. The pour produced a small soapy head that quickly faded to nothing, and left no lace.
A: Tart green apples, lemon, slight citursy hops, and soury sweetness.
T: Sour, sweet, divine. The sour tartness balances so well with the malty sweetnes of the brew. The sourness is not over the top, it just plays so well the plethora of flavors. It finishes tart and dry with absolutley no hint of ABV.
M: Lower on the carbonation, but not in a bad way. Medium body and rather slick.
O: This is one great beer. I don't like the overpowering sourness of many wilds, but this one is just about perfect for me. I would put this at the top of the list in terms of sours. Skal. 789 charactersGtreid, Jul 01, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 509' Bottle opened for my coworker and I at Toronado SD 6/29/11. What a treat!
Pops open with a bit of a gush, but the pour smacks the head in the face and you get a pour with almost no head. Bubbles gently caress the outskirts of the bottle. It pours a golden rod yellow and is very opaque. The smell is very fruity, but not very yeasty as some American Wild Ales tend to be. The tartness is also very well toned down in this beer. The mouthfeel on this beer is very playful its not too light. A very refreshing beer! Overall this beer is a definite A+ but the drinkability of it is kind of low unless you have an in with Toronado crew. 637 charactersdeathcharms, Jun 30, 2011

Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma ws comprised of sweet malt, fruit, sour, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, funk, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. My only gripe about this one was that the flavor was quite subdued... While the flavor was great it just seemed slightly watered down compared to the other offerings I have had as of late. The aroma on this however was nothing short of excellent though. How good was this one you might ask??? Myself and Kenneyho started using it as a palate cleanser at around 2AM that morning... Definitely worth the buzz that surrounds this one. Hope to try some older vintages for comparison in the future for comparison (hint hint traders). 1,110 charactersthagr81us, Jun 28, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had at Toronado yesterday, reviewing from notes.
Poured from the bottle into a tulip, either I was too aggressive or this beer loves to foam. The better part of the glass was white head, which receded fairly quickly (subsequent pours had significantly less head). Color is a pale yellow.
The sourness in this beer really hits you. It's noticeable from quite a distance. Beyond that there's a mild fruitiness, I can't decipher the fruit, and something odd that must be the oak. The taste is more of the same, but it's pleasantly dry, and the frutiness is muted. The aftertaste is quite oaky. Mouthfeel is standard for the style.
All in all an enjoyable beer, glad I made the journey to get it, but don't think I'd do it again. 728 charactersstupac2, Jun 19, 2011
3.87/5  rDev -14%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Bottle at Toronado, SF. 2010 vintage. Poured into a tulip.
3.5 A: First pour was a surprisingly clear darker yellow color. Two and a half fingers of light, frothy white head. Retention isn't too impressive and only some spotty lacing.
4.0 S: Good mix of fruity sweet and sour. Lots of tangy lactic acid with maybe a touch of acetic acid. A lot of oak and a good bit of vanilla, but only slightly tannic. Quite fruity like sweet tarts. I've heard this used for DDG, but it seems to be appropriate here as well. Wild apple, lemon, generic berry, and perhaps some peach. 
4.0 T: Like the nose - a good mix of fruity and sour. Again the lactic acid is dominant with just barely any hints of acetic, though overall this is far from mouth puckering. Lemon, peach, sour green apple, and lemongrass. Again a good bit of oak and vanilla with a low tannic astringency.
4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Despite LA's reputation, this is fully carbonated and perhaps a bit too much so. Good creaminess and certainly smooth.
3.5 D: Good beer, but it isn't as impressive (at least not this vintage) as the reputation suggests. However, if nothing else, it is well balanced and highly drinkable. Good value for $20, barely acceptable for $30, but $40 is far too much after the novelty is achieved. 1,281 charactersDavoleBomb, Jun 17, 2011

Pours a hazy and yellowed amber with a half-finger white cap. Some lacing.
Nice citrus notes – lemon and orange – alongside light white wine vinegar, green apple, and apricot. There’s some funk, but less than I expected, really: soft farmhouse straw-like must alongside a woody and mushroomy brettanomyces bruxellensis funk.
The moderate sourness gives way to a lightly fruity, citrusy tartness. It almost resembles a cider, with its notes of white wine vinegar and lactic acidity, though it is balanced by a good bit of oak and earthy funk. A citrus/quasi-tropical fruitiness (e.g., kumquat) and bready sweetness rounds out the mid-palate.
Medium light in body with medium carbonation. There’s a pleasant dry finish following the lactic acidity. Very drinkable, though I wouldn’t object to a little more acidity, which I’m sure varies according to the vintage. Personally, I wouldn’t give up the farm for this, but wouldn’t pass up a chance to try it. 1,030 charactersVerecund, Jun 16, 2011

Golden yellow in color with very little head. Minimal lacing. Medium carbonation.
Aroma of sour and tart strawberries (!) and lemons. Some barnyard/hay/must that hang around with the funk.
Taste: Sour and tart lemons and citrus fruits. The flavors tingle and dance on the tongue. Very pleasant and crisp. Reminds me a bit of sweet tarts. Though i don't get much, if anything, out of the oak aging. The best american wild i have had thus far. Definitely not over-hyped.

A- Pours a golden yellow wheat color. Had a 1 finger white head and good amounts lacing that chilled with us throughout the tasting.
S- Has a strong funky lemon scent. I'm not sure this is what it's supposed to smell like due to the fact that I drink darker brews.
T- Upon first sip, this BadBoy was sour. Made me wanna break some boards Bruce Lee Style. The sourness became more bearable the more I sipped and the more the beer warmed.
M- Medium bodied and smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation.
 
O- This reminds me alot like a shocktart. Makes your face pucker but you go back for more. The more I drink this, the better it taste. To me, this is definitely not worth the $40 pricetag. I'm glad to say I tried it but I won't be trying this again anytime soon. 848 charactersDevi0us, May 31, 2011

Poured into my tulip glass and a thin wispy bright white head forms. Does recede fairly quickly. The beer is a very bright gold/brass color. Excellent clarity. Some light spotty lacing.
Aroma is fantastic. Bright, some acidic notes, apple comes to mind. Perhaps a touch of lemon.
With the first sip I get very excited as my favorite flavor component of the roasted nuts is present. The tartness is present but with soft round edges. I’d be lying if I didn’t say I thought of Sweet Tart candies. That’s actually a good thing. The bread flavors just below the surface are fantastic. A moment of nectarine and tangerine here. Nice fruit notes. Lot’s going on. There is a salty quality to this that I didn’t expect. Seems to mix well with the nuttiness and bread like qualities. Green apple pops up now and again.
Very delicate body and a wonderful refreshing mouth feel.
This is truly a treat to drink. Believe the hype. Perhaps made even better as it’s been a while since I’ve had a sour. Just fantastic.
Thanks Alex. 1,162 charactersReagan1984, May 31, 2011

O - Outstanding, great wild ale. Another one I was beginning to think I'd never get to sample. Interesting, slightly different combo of fruity flavors in a wild and balanced very well with a distinct but manageable tartness/sourness. 877 charactersportia99, May 28, 2011

Orangy-yellow with a tiny amount of head. The nose is tart lemon with a nice funky sour smell. Like funk-spiked lemonade. The taste is like the nose - sour, funky, dry lemonade. No booze comes off at all, this beer is light and freshing. If this beer came in $9 6-packs, I would enjoy them all summer long. Really a fantastic, easy drinking sour. If you haven't enjoyed sours before, this is a really nice entry point - too bad it is so difficult to get. 481 charactersseeswo, May 27, 2011
3.47/5  rDev -22.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Cable car Lost Abbey, 7.0% wild ale
A: Light pilsner color, mellow gold, a refined golden ambiance
S: strong sour geuze smell, crushed sweettarts and a melted fruitloops wafting
T: This beer is intimidating at first, strong smells and notes, but ultimately this is a calf that you can wrangle not without oppression. It is akin to mutton busting, something that seems difficult until you tackle the sheep, and pull its majestic fur to the ground. At its core, it is temptation with milder souring, lighter drying effects, less tanins in the grape aftertaste, and finally champagne crisp apple notes in the finish. Nothing you can't handle but an exceptional balance. It is the lovechild of gueuze and champagnes of the mild brut variety.
M: Fantastic, crisp and light, the entire experience has lemon zest and feels like a Hootie and the Blowfish Album. You can dispense this pellmell and no one will look askance. If not for the oppressive Toronado's standards, this could be something everyone could enjoy, if not for proprietary despotism. Not worth bootlegging, not worth epic trades. Just really good, but if you want to tread this road, there are more refined paths as smoothe as marble for your wanting cart.
D: Again, fantastic but competing in a league of legends. I would drink this all day, fixing my carburator, prepartying for the charity gala, snuff film exposition, you know, guy stuff. I find myself in a love hate resolution with this beer because I love what it is but I hate the air surrounding it. It feels like seeing a person with a TOOL shirt on. you love the syncopated rhythms and complex melodies, but you dislike the fanbase in general. The faux highbrow ruins what would be a fantastic experience.
Narrative: Sir Fredrick Willingsly is repossessing your car. You can't hate him for doing his job, but, without a 1998 civic DX, these pizzas arent going to deliver themselves. You hate him, with his cliche antagonistic handlebar moustache and fogged up monocle. However, his wry quips relating to Howards' End and class struggle made it all the sweeter. "And thence upon from which one has had, none shall take without" he declares with a cloud of aplomb that almost makes you lighthearted in his usurpation of your chief economic asset. He is akin to the Mr. peanut of recurring vengeance. your pocket despises him, yet you respect him for his casuistic enforcement of the law. "God speed Willingsly, dont scratch my sick mugen exhaust on the dip. Godspeed." 2,492 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, May 26, 2011

A: Straw, translucent; filmy white head with lacing tracking up the glass. Fine, champagne-like columns of carbonation. Standard for the style, but attractive.
S: Horses and vinegar, in force. Fermented fruit, calvados. No malt to be found. This is a very good thing.
T: Opens tart (I feel stupid writing that), and stays that way but with lemon (not something I've tasted in a beer like this), very muted malt in the background, apple cider as usual but less assertively than in others in the style. Finishes bone-dry. Orval-dry
M: dry, effervescent
Very good, very expensive. 602 characterskajerm, May 18, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pale orange color to this one. Slight ring of head around it. Amazing aroma, extremely tart, funky, nothing really fruity to it, beyond what you would think to be lemon based on the sheer tartness, but nonetheless, fantastic. 
Taste = sour. Lemon, slight wood notes. Its actually pretty straightforward and not complex, just massively sour, extremely dry. Extremely light body to it, never feels heavy, nor alcoholic. Shit, if you could just chill on these around the pool in the backyard. Gets better as it warms, which I didn't think was possible at first it was so good.
Expensive. Can't get a perfect overall score when you're $40 and only available at 2 bars, one of which sucks ass. 690 charactersBeerandraiderfan, May 17, 2011

A: The beer pours a straw yellow color and is quite hazy. The head is fluffy white and about ¾ of a finger in size. Throughout the drink there was good head retention and nice lacing.
S: The smell was of chalky lemons with just a hint of wood/nuttiness
T: There’s a fair bit of lemons, sour, but not as much funk/earthiness as in many other wild ales. The flavor is not overwhelming by any means and has some oakiness and yeastiness up front.
M: The finish on this beer was balanced, enjoyable, and lingering. The carbonation was appropriate, as was the viscosity.
O: I was glad to have tried this, but given the exclusivity and price tag, probably won’t search it out again. It was good, but better, similar beers can be found much more easily. 787 charactersglazeman, May 16, 2011

The pour was a slight hazy golden orange with a touch of yellow showing through. The head was limited to the lightness of the carbonation. 
smelled of Lemon peel, with a hint sour wine.(yummy)
The taste was a sweet lemon with hints of oak, and yeasty bread. Almost a champange effect. 
I was suprised at the subtleness of the sour effect from this beer, which after time led to a little sweet character. The finish was gentle but quite long.

A - Pours a clear gold with a creamy white head that dissipates to a slight ring and spotty haze.
S - Complex, Gueuze-like aromas of sour lemon juice, oak, funky horseblanket, and wet straw. Absolutely wonderful.
T - Tart and funky, with a slight sulphury quality, and big flavors of lemon juice, grains, straw, horseblanket, and a very strong oak finish that reminds me of a big, oaked Chardonnay. Excellent level of sourness, very drinkable.
M - Crisp and tart, with a medium body and moderate carbonation. Finish is very drying, with a definite tannic quality to it. Precisely how I like my Wilds, this is spot-on for my tastes.
O - Such a wonderful beer, having it at the Toronado only makes it a more memorable experience. What a night! 813 charactersjsanford, May 09, 2011

a - Pours a hazy yellow color with an inch of white head and light carbonation evident.
s - Smells of sour lemons, other sour fruits, oak, earthy notes. Very nice and sour, though not overally tart. Pretty amazing.
t - Tastes of tart lemon, sour citrus, tart fruits, oak, earthy, grassy notes, and a very light mustiness. Again, absoutely amazing. Not the sourest beer I've ever had, but one of the more enjoyable sour beers.
m - Light to medium body and low to moderate carbonation.
o - Overall one of the best sours I've had; I'm really glad it actually lived up to my expectations. Had a lot of great beers at DLD and this one was probably my favorite. Lots of sour and tart lemons and while not overly sour, it's very refreshing and enjoyable. Would jump at the chance to by a bottle of this one when and if I make it out to Toronado. 1,011 charactersmdfb79, May 09, 2011

The color of this beer is really quite eye-catching. Bright tangerine in color with a loose, bright white head and a semi-hazy clarity. The head is refreshed with a gentle swirl of the glass and sheets of lacing coat the sides of the glass, gradually yielding to some strands and spots of lacing encircling the bowl. Nose is fairly subdued - tart citrus and a trace of cork. Taste reveals tart and acidic citrus fruit, a slightly salty character and the flavor of cork. Mouthfeel is light in body with an effervescence akin to champagne. This beer is so tart that it puckers the cheeks before culminating in a very dry finish. This has to be, by far, the sourest sour I've had to date. There's a lot going on here and I'm grateful to finally have the opportunity to try this beer outside of a fest. 887 charactersJwale73, May 09, 2011

Pours a pretty golden yellow. a bit hazy with a nice amount of white head. Smell is phenomenal. Tons of tart sour lemons with a nice grassy touch. The sour kick is very prominent but not offputting like some "overly sour" beers I've had. Tastes very mellow. Lots of tart lemon with a sourness that melds well with the rest of the beer. I could drink this all day every day. The flavour profile is predominently lemon with some nice grassy tones in the background. Overall solid mouthfeel, very drinkable. My favourite sour to date. 746 charactersUrbancaver, May 04, 2011

Pours a slightly hazy pale orange. The head fills half of the Russian River tulip the server gave me to enjoy the beer out of. Slowly fading mound of bubbles due to the effervescent flow of bubbles steadily rising. 
The aroma seemed to constantly change. First sniff was filled with lemon zest and sour funk. Then I started getting some orange and some oak. Up next was grassy herbs and sourdough bread. This would have gotten a 5 for aroma if something would have smacked me in the face. Lots there, but not overwhelmingly powerful.
The flavor mimics the smell quite nicely. Tart lemon, wet grass, white wine grapes, bit of wood, and some sour funk. Not exceedingly tart or sour. Nice balance for the style. Delicious!
The carbonation is very active. Prickly on the tongue throughout most of the bottle. A little drying. Overall...wow! So glad I finally got to have this one. Worth the wait. 978 charactersImstillthegman, May 03, 2011

A - Pours light, orange-tinged yellow with a ton of thin, bubbly head. Probably 4 fingers. This one is certainly effervescent.
S - Wow! Tons of lemon and orange zest with a strong acidity that blows up in your face. A bit of honey, with few to no hops at all.
T - First few sips are all sweetness up front and sour on the finish. Sugary, honey sweetness right on the tip of your tongue, followed by floral lemon juice and bitterness, finishes with acid and more lemon. Some other citrus fruits can also be detected.
M - Mouthfeel is thin, but not watery. Carbonation is high, but mellows with each sip. A bit of astringency, but still doesn't feel bad on the mouth.
O - Way too expensive, but a very tasty brew. May have to bring a couple friends to drink one of these next time. 826 charactersdmsohyea, Apr 25, 2011

Pours a cloudy yellow with a half inch head. Leaving no lacing and head fades quickly.
Smell is of oak, brett funk, lemons, vinegar, herbs, lactic, and bread...there is a lot going on...everything in balance and everything delicious.
Taste follows smell, each sip gives something new. Oak on the end with lemons cleaning the palate with carbonation. Vinegar, bread and brett are inital and they all carry though to the end.
Mouthfeel is moderate with good carbonation, would be excellent to pair with a burger or steak.

App: hazy gold straw with tons of head that sustains great lace and a touch if cling
smell: wine barrels it has to be. funky and sweet at the same time. Fantastic sour aroma, bites the nose with a puckering sweetness
taste: heaven. Delicate, balanced, pucker that starts and finishes but somehow manages bitter too. Sweet middle body that has white grapes, dryness, complexity and tartness, touch if funk bit it doesn't last. Sooo effing smooth start to finish.

A - Hazy dull yellow with a super fizzy two finger head. This recedes to a thin film with little retention and medium lacing.
S - Dry, slightly estery with lemon, grass and a ton of funk. Smells a bit farty.
T - Lots of funky grass and straw, mellow dry white wine flavors, lemon and plenty of yeast. The flavors are clean and makes for a quick drinker. This isn't as sour as it is funky, it reminds me more of a bretty saison with loads of funk. Subtle, clean, funky.
M - carbonation cleans the palate nicely, the tartness and funk doesn't linger long. The carbonation is just spot on, love it.
D - Drinks so quickly and the carbonation helps save the palate. 700 charactersdrewba, Mar 02, 2011

A-Nice straw yellow pour with nice big white fluffy head into an allagash tulip. 
S- Lemon, grass, earth, some slight horse blanket funk but really not too funky. Really crisp smell with a hint of mild sourness.
T- Very subdued tartness and super refreshing. Reminded me of a hot day and grabbing a saison or pilsner to quench the thirst but then leads into the slight funk and balanced sourness. Bright citrus fruits and lemon pepper.
M- Nice mouthfeel with med-high carbonation and really balanced dry sourness and crispness

2010 vintage shared with some BAs.
Crystal clear yellow pour with a big fizzy white head. Aroma is eggy, funky, and has a slight band-aid/plastic presence as well. The underlying flavor is similar to that of a saison - grainy, lemony, peppery. Flavor also consists of wood, barnyard funk, and tropical fruits. Sourness is moderate - not too offensive. Medium body and carbonation. Very dry, crisp finish.
Truly a world-class beer. 455 charactersmuttyd, Feb 20, 2011

A - Pours pale yellow with lots of little bubbles racing up the glass into a nice pillow of half finger tall white head leaving spotty wisps of lacing down the glass.
S - Quite a bit of funky brett, lemon, and other bright citric fruits blend well with the strong funk. Pretty tart but not to the point of being overpowering. Very nice stuff.
T - Lots of sourness up front giving way slowly to a mix of strong acidic lemon and some chewy brett funk. Finish is dry with plenty of lingering sour funk. Nice and light, quite refreshing actually. It did wear me down over the course of the bottle but I think that had more to do with me drinking the entire thing myself. I would love to get my hands on a bottle of this for the cellar.
M - Medium-light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Quite the dry feel with plenty of lingering sourness that sticks around for some time.
D - Quite high. How could I not give this a five? I drank the entire bottle in one sitting and I barely felt it. Not too tart like some of the other wild's I have had recently. Nice and refreshing. I wish this wasn't such a pain in the ass to get. I would love to have a few of these for special occasions. Quite tasty stuff for sure. 1,340 charactersorangesol, Feb 14, 2011

A: Pours a hazy lemon-yellow with a couple fingers of bright white bubby head that faded into a thin scum and collar. 
S: Sweeter smelling than expected, but there is still a fair amount of sweaty sock musk. I get some slight lemon but not too much other fruit notes. Smells good though. 
T: Not especially sour, pretty tame really, but it's got a great sweaty citrus taste. This one is hard to tack down, but I think I taste mostly grapefruit juice and bitter grapefruit pith. Aftertaste is rather sweet. Very delicious. 
M: Fizzy mouthfeel over a medium body. This one is crazy super dry, although there are no gritty tannins.
D: This one is even better than my previous LA favorite, DDG. This is extremely drinkable and just stupid good. Could be a bit more sour, but the way it is now just makes it easier for me to drink more. Thank you so much for your generosity (again) ipa247!
EDIT: Additional notes from CC Vertical, Jan 2012:
07: Notes of shit on the nose. Nothing much to the flavor anymore. Very low carbonation. Very mellow all-around. Past prime. 
08: Bubblier than the 07 with more acid and more flavor as well. Lightly funky and very smooth. Drinking great!
09: Bubblier than the 08. Big acetone notes. The most tart of any, and the harshest. Still a great beer though. 1,391 charactersscottfrie, Feb 06, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -10.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Cable Car has light golden colored body with about a finger of fizzy white head. The head disappears completely, leaving behind nothing to show that it was ever there at all.
The aroma has lots of light fruits; peaches and apricots come to mind. Also a good bit of sourness and some musty, funkiness.
Cable Car is more sour than average, but it is not a tongue-attacked sour bomb by any means. The first flavors I notice are the solid amount of tartness that comes a long with a bunch of fruity notes. Once again I notice peaches and apricots, but also some generic light fruits to back those flavors up. Next a slight brett-like horse-blanket flavor that is noticeable but not as powerful as either the sourness or the fruit. After that a hint of wood and some white wine vinegar-like flavors appear for just a second. 
I would probably like to see a little more carbonation in the mouthfeel, but it isn't too bad as it is.
Interesting and complex, Cable Car is a pretty good Wild Ale that doesn't leave your tongue feeling like it took a beating, but maintains a lot of sourness. With that said, I really wouldn't pay forty bucks at Toronado for a bottle. Well, if I could go back in time I wouldn't anyway. 1,213 charactersHojaminbag, Jan 13, 2011

Saw this beauty behind be glass cooler and just had to have it, even at $40/bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a slightly hazed amber gold color with a nice fluffy white head that settles to a nice collar and leaves lace. The aroma is very nice, a blend of sweet grape, fruit, and a nice sourness as well. Very white wineish. Light mothfeel with a fai bit of carbonation. The taste is nice but not as sour as I thought it would be but being the 2010, I'm not surprised it hasn't fully soured up yet. Slightly sweet start like apricot gives way to some funkiness.

I had heard about the egg fart character in this batch discussed at the Toronado anniversary party and that was on my mind as i had it.
Ar: Fruity, tart cherry, raspberry, sulfur hints, very fruity, tropical fruit, citric, mild egg fart character that dissipates quickly.
Ap: Thick white head, good retention, clear gold
T: Sulfur, cherry, raspberry, lemon, tart citrus, peach/nectarine, very mild green/herbal character, very strong berry, tropical fruit, not too sour, clean malt, simple light sweetness, tangerine, floral, slight residual sweetness.
M: Thin body, high carbonation, sour but smooth, *cheesy/buttery mouthfeel
O: Very good, tons of fruit character, minimal funk, was looking for the sulfur but it is definitely there, the sulfur isn't too strong or obtrusive but it is present and is less pleasant that the dupont sulfur character, sulfur character dissipates quickly.
I like the fruit rather than funk oriented Lost Abbey sour character present in this, DDG, Brouwer's imagination, IP. I wish it had more funk but all in all a very good beer and time seems to be helping it a lot from reports i heard of this initially. 1,236 charactersDaveJanssen, Jan 05, 2011

A: Pours a clean golden straw-like hue with a small thin head, leaving minor amounts of lacing in my glass.

A- Pours a light golden color, semi-clear. Produced a half fingers width of white head that lasted throughout consumption. 
S- As soon as I smelled it, I knew it was going to be a good sour. Immediately notes of sour lemons come forth. Underneath it all, a blend of apple skins, vinegar and brett are very noticeable. Nice complexity and great balance.
T- Very much like the aroma. A citric lemon flavor envelops the palate with a hint of green apples. Aside from fruit flavor, a decent amount of funk resides underneath, offering a nice balance to the beer. Finishes with a moderate amount of tartness. 
M- Light bodied with a good amount if carbonation. The mouthfeel was semi-dry to dry and a perfect match for this sour.
D- Great flavors and good carbonation made this really easy to put down. The tartness was nowhere near overpowering.
Overall, Lost Abbey has failed to impress me on so many levels. However, this beer (and vintage) might be the exception. Might be one of the best American sours I have had aside from Deviation. 1,203 charactersrhinos00, Nov 19, 2010

Poured a semi-hazy straw yellow. with a nice 2 fingers of white fluffy head.
the aroma is a mild funk with some bright lemon tartness. 
the taste is pretty good. Upfront you get a mixturen of sweetness... kinda lemon, citrus maybe... in the middle of the palate you get the barnyard and funk coming out a bit with some more sweetness. The back of the palate is where the tartness kicks in a hits the throught a little bit.
over all a great beer. This vintage is certainly young and needs some more time to develop and creat the tart sour flavors that are missing! 628 characterspastradul, Nov 16, 2010

A: Pours a fluffy, semi-coarse .5 finger head white head with great retention. Beer is a semi-clear light orange-ruby red. Lacing is minimal and with little stick. 
S: Nose is funky with a slight Brett in the back. Notes of lemon rind, citrus, and tartness. Fruitiness is apparent and aromatic and sweet. Lacto and Brett hides behind. 
T: Opens with a nice tartness and sweetness. Very fruity. Hints of lemon, unripened peach, and citrus makes this one very fruity towards the middle. Tartness comes back towards the end before finishing dry with a slight Bretty funk. Aftertaste is near non-existant. 
M: Light bodied and well carbonated. Lively and coarse in the mouth. Bubbles invigorate the palate. Finish is dry with near no aftertaste. 
D: Hugely dirnkable. Very balanced in every way. Tartness is present but not overwhelming and this is one of the fruitiest AWAs that I've had in a while. 7% is not high but alcohol seems nearly non-existant here.

A: Body exhibits a deep yellow hue, mild lacing, and a bold white fizzy head. 
S: The nose is hit hard with a strong tartness at first, but then follows through with aromas similar to banana/tropical fruit. Wood becomes more noticeable as the beer begins to warm up.
T: The flavor profile is weaker/lighter than the smell indicated earlier. Definitely has that tart/sour kick you look for within this style, but is overbearing at times. So much that it applies a harsh character that masks some of the underlying flavors. Along with that, the oak is robust as well, perhaps too much.
M: Very light in body with ample amounts of carbonation.
D: Even with some of it's harsh qualities, this beer is quite enjoyable and goes down quite easily.
Overall: A very good "sour" for sure, just not sure if it's the best. I prefer "Duck Duck Gooze" and/or "Isabelle Proximus" over "Cable Car". A must try. Cheers! 972 charactersOlieIPA, Nov 09, 2010

Ive had this beer a number of times, A fresh bottle is about as sour as it gets IMO. I had this a few times in all vintages, I opened a batch1 about 10 months ago and remember that it was alot less sour and funky, It had supprised me how much it had faded over time. 792 charactersGradyS1, Nov 07, 2010

Review #550
The nearly clear, golden amber liquid was topped by a small, bubbly cap of froth. Within a few minutes, the head completed dissipated.
The aroma was simply astounding. Super funky with lots of must and barnyard character. Very oaky, leathery and "old." Tart and quite acidic with some slightly sweet, fruity notes. Green apple was noticeable, along with a touch of lemon. Some honey was also detectible.
Lots of sour funk and must also came through in the flavor profile. The brett character was really intense. Fruity. Green apple notes were apparent. Super tart and lemony on the finish with a strong oakiness. Somewhat white wine-like. Lots of acidity and yeastiness as well. As the beer warmed, the lemon character grew even stronger. Ultra crisp and dry. This wild ale definitely ranks high up there in terms of sourness.
The only somewhat disappointing aspect of this beer was the mouthfeel. It was quite thin with a fizzy, moderate effervescence.
Drinkability was impressive. The 7% ABV was incredibly well masked. Although the tartness was intense, this beer was nevertheless a real treat to sip and savor.
Cable Car is definitely one of the best American wild ales I have yet to try. I would love the opportunity to sample this again. 1,364 charactersDamian, Nov 06, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52007 bottle generously shared at a recent Chicago crew tasting, thanks! Pours a golden yellow with no head, some bubbles here and there. Smell is a musky spice, some lemon and acidic notes, a bit of funk. Taste is pretty amazing - tart orange, cinnamon spiciness, sour but very clean. Some mellow peaches in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium/light with a low carbonation, not too dry but finishes clean. An amazing beer, different from any sour I have had. Very, very drinkable. 476 charactersnkersten, Nov 04, 2010

Immense thanks goes to alcstradamus for sharing this one!!!
This is a hazy yellow/straw color. It had an almost two-finger head of foam, which recedes to almost nothing after a minute or so. Basically just a surface ring, which leaves some moderate lacing down the side of the glass.
Lemons, apricots and green apples dominate. Nice hints of funkiness and some musty barnyard presence, as well. Some lactic tart notes, provide the expected tart level, but it's not quite as tart as I had expected.
Here's the tartness that I expected. Alright!
Lots of lemon tartness, along with some hints of white grapes and apricots. Light traces of green apple skins. All of this tartness is balanced by a beautifully blended level of barnyard funkiness and a slight touch of mustiness.
Very tasty.
Medium-to-almost-full-bodied, which surprised me, I admit. I expected it to be lighter, so I am very pleased by this. The carbonation is on the high side, but it's what is expected of the style. It helps this maintain a crisp and refreshing feel, yet it manages to have a slight hint of creaminess.
The initial sip was just a touch too sour to get a perfect score here. Then, with each succesive sip, the flavor becomes more and more of a friend to you. You eventually just want more and more of it. This works completely to it's advantage for sure.
This is a damn tasty bottle of beer and probably the ultimate representation of the American Wild Ale style. Not too sour, not too funky, highly drinkable. 1,582 characterscoldmeat23, Sep 27, 2010

4.64/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52010 vintage imbibed at Toronado in SF. Poured from a caged-and-corked 750mL bottle into a tulip.
Citrine, lightly hazy body with an initially substantial ivory head which dissipates quickly but a rapid swirl promptly brings back a fizzy finger and a more lasting collar. The final pour is opaque, presumably from the yeast.
Wildflowers (pollen?), potent woody funk, plenty of "horse blanket," and orange peel in the nose. The fragrances grow ever more intense and complex as it warms.
Anchovies, kim chee, blue cheese, along with citrus on the palate. Tart and mineral heavy (almost salty) mid-palate though not bracingly sour. Very ester-heavy but not jammy. Somewhat vinuous like a good chardonnay, and lightly tannic. 
Zippy, spritzy, and bright mouthfeel.
Exceptionally drinkable (despite some of my adjectives above, this really isn't an esoteric beverage), and a great beer to share with good friends. 913 charactersaugustgarage, Sep 09, 2010

A - Slightly hazy straw-yellow, with a large rocky off-white head. Nice retention and lacing. 
S - Okay, so I've heard plenty of reports -- from some people whose opinions I respect -- of sulfurous odors and such. I'm happy to say that I didn't get that at all in my bottle. I also shared it with a couple of people next to me and the bartender just to make sure, and no one had that experience. Not sure if I just got a good bottle or what. Anyway, plenty of lemon, lots of barnyard funk, and a good dose of oak. Very pleasant. 
T - Pucking sourness right off the bat. Lemony flavors smack you in the face, and then the vinegar takes over. Oak is all up in your face. The funkiness really dominates, and I mean that in the best possible way. The citrus cuts through it in the end. Long dry finish. Very little alcohol evident.
M - Very nicely carbonated, with almost a creamy feel at times, and at other times almost champagne-like. Light and dry.
D - After most of a bottle, this didn't faze me too much. The flavors would keep me coming back if not for the obvious cost issue.
O - Hmmm. Is this a beer that I would cross the world for? Or pay $40 for again? Well, probably not. It's too similar to several cheaper, although also very limited, beers that I have in the cellar. But is it a beer that I'm very glad to have tried? Absolutely. 1,402 charactersdjmichaelk, Sep 05, 2010

A: Pours a cloudy, pale straw body; it is well carbonated and maintains a solid cap. 
S: Sulfurous eggs. This is comically bad. It is actually an offensive odor; there is no way I am going to give this a higher score in the smell department. 
T: Vinegar, tart lemon, mild hay, oak. I pick up some tropical fruit as well. This is worlds better than the nose. A bit on the sweet side, and I'd like to see this funkier instead of being a straight sour, but it's still good. 
M: Well-carbonated, effervescent. Goes down quite well. Foamy in the finish. 
D: $40 for this beer is idiotic. If it were outstanding, I might consider paying it; but for a beer that is a misfire out of the gate and needs time to improve (if it even does), no. 852 charactersArbitrator, Sep 04, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to some very generous California BA's, I was able to do a full four year vertical involving 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010. I am going to start from most recent version and work my way back. 
2010 vintage
I bought a room temperature bottle of Cable Car 2010 first thing on Toronados 23rd Anniversary. I popped the cork and poured two servings. The color was closer to milky white and poured a white fluffy head that eventually left. It smelled borderline offensive, with a sulfur and egg white smell I was a little taken back by the extreme funk. I finally decided by the end of the glass compared to the other years that the smell was entirely offensive and disgusting. It tasted pretty good though, but was a bit of a let down. I later ordered a 2009 bottle and realized that this years batch was 'off' and not to par with the previous years. It tasted of extreme barnyard and must reminding me of some older Fantome beers I have consumed. It had a good carbonation and was drinkable, but the smell was distracting.
2009 vintage
After trying the 2010 vintage I suspected that something was not right and the hype surrounding this beer was for a reason. So I ordered a 2009 vintage and was pleasantly surprised by what I thought was the best year of the four. It had a great champagne color that had a nice white finely carbonated head that left pretty fast. It was oily in nature and incredible delicious. It had great lemon and grapefruit tart flavors with awesome lambic-like sourness. It just had a great lactic and pedio sourness that brought out a great tropical fruit flavor. It was highly carbonated which was perfect for this vintage, the palate was getting entertained from multiple levels. Sourness, carbonation, fruit flavors, awesome beer that I could drink multiple bottles of in one sitting. Delicious. 
2008 vintage 
After pairing the 2010 and 2009 vintages Nerd graciously told us that we had the 2008 and 2007 vintages to compare as well. So we got a healthy pour of each vintage, and I was surprised to learn how different they are were. The 2008 is probably tied or a little less awesome than the 2009. It has a little darker golden color with a head that leaves almost immediately. It smelled a little less fruity than it did must and horseblanket. Still owns a great flavor, really bitter orange peel with grapefruit. Peach and apricot are so fresh and upfront that it gives me reassurance that the hype around these bottles is well deserved. Again, highly carbonated with the flavors on this make it an amazingly drinkable sour. 
2007 vintage. 
My third favorite in the series, you could tell this one is on its way out. I would guess that a year ago this would be amazing, but right now it is a bit muddled and 'silent'. It was a lighter gold color with a head that actually lasted a second or two. It was a bit thinner than the previous two versions but surprisingly enough had a great deal of funk left. Lots of wet dog and mostly must, it was a great sour that was starting to take full circle into a 'funk' type category. It kind of had a stale basement taste, but I didn't mind at this point because I was getting deep in the inebriated category. 
Thanks goes to the California and specifically the bay area crew, nerd being the king of generosity. A great day that will be remembered for days to come.

4.2/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42010 Bottle poured into tulip at Toronado in San Diego
Appearance- Pale straw with thick white fluffy head and nice carbonation
Smell - The first thing that I noticed right of the bat obviously was the sourness with some citrus and cherry notes
Taste - Sour cherries and some citrus just like the nose. Some have commented on a sulfuric taste/smell to this beer which I noticed a slight flavor of; however I did not find it overpowering. This is a very mellow sour beer
Mouth-Lightly puckering with nice carbonation
Drink- Easy drinking beer, especially for a sour, possibly too easy of a beer for this style. Overall a good and well balanced beer, but could have used a little more flavor. I will be interested to see how this beer matures over time in comparison to the previous vintages. 795 characterstjfinkle, Aug 16, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42010 @ toronado San Fran
Pours a lignite straw yellow with a hit of haze and a nice tall fizzy head.
Lots of lemon and vinegar on the nose. Subtle malt and citrus hops. Light oak character in the back.
Taste was similar to the smell. Lots of lemon zest with a strong vinegar sourness to it. The malt character really was noticeable in the back. This really reminded me of a gueuze.
Lots of carbonation with a light body. Slight dryness.
Now that I have had this fresh, I prefer this aged. The aged 2007 seemed to have more fruit flavors where as this came across as a fresh unbalanced gueuze. Would I pay forty a bottle again? Most likely... 646 charactershooliganlife, Aug 14, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52009 vintage bottle at Toronado SD on 6/30. Review from notes.
a - Hazy deep golden, half inch white head with decent retention and lacing
s - Big lemon and apricot notes mixed with a heavy dose dirty gym socks, best funkiness i've had from an American sour
t - Big sour lemon, apricot and peach burst up front, b.o. funk on the midpalate along with more tart citrus, finish is a heavy lingering lemon and peach tartness with lighter barnyard funk, alcohol is hardly noticeable, really incredible stuff
m - Medium bodied with higher carbonation, very sprtzy on the palate, very dry finish, very good for the style
d - The complexity and absence of alcohol tastes make this stuff incredibly drinkable, intense but not wearing on the palate either, the price tag and rarity are the only things working against it
This one lived up to the hype for me.  This is probably the second best American sour that I've had after RR Deviation, and slightly ahead of RR Beatification.  Well done, Tomme! 997 charactersWeisGuy, Jul 06, 2010

Thanks to Anwar for sharing this gem!
Review from notes, early first vintage 2007.
Into a wine glass it poured a glowing orange, with a slight haze but surprisingly some clarity as well. Visible rising carbonation, a thin ring of foam at the edges, and a ghostly wispy skim across the surface. No lace remained in the glass. 
Bright fruity aroma, a blended cocktail of sweetish grapefruit, white grape, lychee, and lemon. Oaky too, with a mild spice, and some minerals. 
Puckering and tart, balanced sourness, lemon, orange, and grapefruit blend seamlessly. It lingers on the palate, with traces of oak, citrus, and grape. Salivary glands kick into overdrive. Clean and quenching sourness, balanced with a good deal of wild complexity. Unique but maybe not the pinnacle sour ale from Lost Abbey. Thanks again Anwar for the opportunity! 893 charactersemerge077, Jun 21, 2010
3.45/5  rDev -23.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5From notes. Thanks alcstradamus for the chance to try this one. 
Colored somewhere between light brown and yellow, murky, but possibly due to transportation of the beer. Average sized head, off white, average retention although the successive pours were small to judge the retention. 
Aroma is funky, leathery, cheesy, with some fruity and acidic notes as well as a buttery hint. Nice, not spectacular. Oak notes are modest. 
Light to medium bodied, it again suffers from under carbonation. It is not flat like some of their other offerings, but it would be significantly better had a bit more carbonation been present. 
Flavor is fruity, and funky; nice but again well short of spectacular. Dry for most of it, but not significantly sour/puckering/tart. It definitely lacks in that department. Yeasty notes are present as well. 
This is a good, pleasant beer, but by no means worth the hype, or the price tag.
I was very glad and thankful for the opportunity, but solidifies my poor overall impression of Lost Abbey. 1,018 charactersbrdc, May 29, 2010

A: Pours a light, somewhat hazy apricot color with a nice white head and a decent amount of lacing.
S: The initial smell is quite sweet and balanced. The sourness is assertive but not at all overwhelming. Picked up quite a few notes of apricot and peach.
T: Similar to the nose in that there is a surprising amount of balance to this, unlike most other Lost Abbey sours that I've come across. Nice stone fruit flavors alongside the lactic sourness. Overall, a very nice balance, just not quite what I was expecting. Hints of orange and lemon zest.
M: Nice sourness and low carbonation.
D: Very drinkable all around for a sour. Definitely glad to finally be able to try this one out and would love to have it again, although it's definitely not quite up there with Isabelle and Veritas 004. 809 charactersThorpe429, May 18, 2010

Pours yellow with a large, white head. 
Smells of citrus with grapes and peaches. Some vinegar with some puckering sourness.
A shockingly robust amount of citrus bombards the tongue. Mild sourness... am able to pick out those peaches and grapes I smelled. Wet hay and slight leather notes round it out. Delicious.
Perfect carbonation with some serious drinkability for a sour as it's not too sour. Amazing stuff. 491 charactersrudylaw, May 18, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle consumed at Toronado San Diego - been waiting a while to try this one.
Pours a slightly hazy golden-peach color with a two-finger white head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing.
Smells of funk - wet hay and leather is the best way I can describe it - along with good amounts of sugar-coated fruits - apricots, pears, and peaches, in that order.
Tastes similar to how it smells. Indistinct malt flavors serve as the backbone and allow funk and fruit flavors to run roughshod. A funkiness as described above permeates the flavor profile, although there's also a certain harsher (though not in a bad way) addition to the flavor profile via the oak. Ripe apricot and peach flavors are at the forefront with syrupt pear flavors lurking in the background. The ending is crisp and leaves just a hint of funkiness lingering on the palate.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a nice thickness with active carbonation.
Drinkability is great. I finished my glass very quickly and could easily have a few more. The flavors are all robust but manage to complement each other very well.
Overall this beer didn't disappoint. It isn't the best sour that I've ever had but it does come very close. Well worth the shot if you can get your hands on it. 1,271 charactersglid02, May 14, 2010

2009 Vintage
A: Like golden-orange body. Thin white bubbly head. Quickly receded and left traces of lacing behind on the glass.
S: Delicate, like fruits including peaches, apricots, lemons, and green apples. Lightly sour in the nose with a nice subtle funkyness.
T: Bam. This was good. When it comes to sours I am a sucker for the lighter citric wilds (brute, temtpation, sactification, fou foune). This one is bangin. Lots of soft peaches and apricots. An acidic lemon twist and a nice sour green apple. Some subtle tart grape skins rounds out this treat.
M: Medium bodied with a gentle rolling carbonation throughout. Sweet, tart, sour and funky. This definitely a challenging workout for the tastebuds. In the end its got a nice dry refreshing quality that leaves you thoroughly satiated.
D: Yeah. This is good. Real, real good. Wish I had more. But sadly this is it. 901 characterscallmemickey, Apr 30, 2010

Pours a cloudy golden color with 2 fingers of head in my small tasting glass. The aroma is intensely tart with a mixed back of fruits including lemons, pears, and apple. Exactly what I would hope for.
The flavor is very tart and dominated by white grapes and lemon. Mouth puckering-ly sour and accompanied by a light and balanced funkiness. Well rounded and integrated flavors and very tasty.
The body is medium/full and the carbonation is about perfect for the style. Overall this one met my expectations and was definitely memorable. One of the better American Wild Ales I've had the pleasure of drinking. 694 charactersalcstradamus, Apr 26, 2010
4.64/5  rDev +3.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this bottle at a tasting. 2007 version.
Cable Car pours an orange gold color that looks like it would be somewhat clear, but is actually completely hazed. The head is just about non existent, and even a swirl produces only a thin wisp.
The aroma is intense, fruity, and sour. There is a little bit of cellar like mustiness to it, and only a touch of funk. Sour lemons make up most of the nose, along with a background of some peach like fruitiness. This is intense, but pleasant throughout.
The taste is impressively sour with a good, mouth puckering lemon sourness. A bit of sweetness adds a candy like complexity which is great. It reminds me of one of those powdery, sour jawbreaker type candies I used to get in gumball machines. The finish is dry and very puckering.
The mouthfeel is nice and light, with a good level of "tiny bubble" carbonation to make it refreshing and easy to drink. I would love to have more of this. I'm very glad I got to try this. 968 charactersjeffthecheff, Apr 19, 2010

Cable Car 09 by Lost Abbey is an American Wild Ale aged in oak barrels and 7%. It poured a hazy straw yellow. It smelled very sour, some Chardonnay notes, citrus, oak, wood and some funk. It tasted like citrus, lemon, a hint of pineapple, oak, wood and extremely sour from start to finish with some good bitterness in there as well. It was the tartest of the evening. 415 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to mjn5036 for sharing this bottle at a recent tasting. Poured into a mini goblet. The beer pours a hazy golden yellow with a bubbly white head that leaves little lacing on the sides of the glass.
The smell is crisp sweet ripe fruits (apricots and pears), sharp alcohol, musty funky barrel oakiness, hay and a more subtle than expected lemon and green apple sourness.
The taste is much more tart than the smell, the funky oak and hay characters jump on top of the lemon zestiness and really take you for a ride right out of the gate. There is not much balance to this one, but it's not expected and not necessary. This is a sour beer.
The beer is very carbonated, which is something I really appreciate for this style. I think the carbonation compliments the sharp fruit flavors and overtly sour tones of the beer, there is a nice dry finish that leaves the palate feeling nice and clean and craving more. The crisp flavors, dry finish and well masked alcohol make this beer very drinkable. 1,000 charactersrpstevens, Mar 15, 2010

A: Ring of carbonation glows around the inner glass, light golden with a touch of caramel color, and hazy.
S: Apricots and lemons - and that's all you need. The smell intensifies as the beer warms up to room temp.
T: The perfect blend of fruitiness and funk. Wet hay, sourness, and hints of tangerine combine to create a tangy taste.
M: Smooth carbonation; light and tingly feeling hits the tongue and then the whole mouth.
D: Easygoing; not too funky or sour. I could drink plenty of this.
Overall, I found this to be right in the middle of Isabelle Proximus (funky) and DDG (fruity). I'd like to think of this beer as the definition of a sour. 793 charactershoppymcgee, Mar 12, 2010
4.14/5  rDev -8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42007 Vintage
A: The pour is a very hazy golden yellow color without much head and very little retention.
S: The nose is full of lactic tartness with a mild mustiness and a pleasant barnyard funk. The sourness is primarily in the form of lemon and green apples.
T: The flavor is highly sour with plenty of lemony lactic acid and a touch of vinegar. The funk is much more subdued than the nose would lead you to believe.
M: The body is light to medium with a full carbonation and a nice dry finish.
D: This particular bottle was the best of the Cable Car pours that I've had. A solid sourness and nice fruit character, but a little lacking in the "funk" department. 668 characterswomencantsail, Feb 25, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this on tap at Toronado SD during SD Beer Week alongside the mighty Kegatron.
Appearance is pretty good, sort of a copper orange body topped with a super thin yet bright white head. Small ring sticks around and leaves a slight lace.
Can tell from the aroma that this beer is going to be sour as all hell. Smells a bit like sweet and sour sauce with some green apple highlights and sour cherry notes.
Taste is a lot of the same, sweet up front with some apricot, orange, cherry, lemon and citrus which is followed up quickly by a lingering sourness that is challenging to my palate. Stoney fruits finish it up on the swallow.
Super vibrant and poppy in the mouth, medium chewiness and pretty slick.
Drinkability was higher than I originally thought upon first sip. As you become acustomed to the sourness it goes down easier and easier until you want to just chug the whole glass. It's kind of like drinking the sweet tarts candy :) 940 charactersBubba83, Feb 21, 2010

A: Pours a nice palish yellow hue with a very tall white head. Above average retention with a few spots of lace.
S: Wonderful aromas of citrus with mild notes of tart peaches. Yeast, vinegar, tart, and sourness... Yum.
T: Wonderful citrus up front. Acidic, but not overthetop. Mild vinegar with hints of peach, apricot, and light woody notes. There is some wet hay goodness, with hints of leather and barnyard.
M: Medium in body, snappy carbonation and the acidity bites at the tongue a bit. 
N: Not overly tart or sour. Well done, and damn tasty for sure. 609 characterstpd975, Feb 20, 2010

There aren't many beers that are hyped as much as cable car that are genuinely this good. I love me a good wicked tart beer and this qualifies. Both the aroma and the flavor are pungently tart and dry with a touch of the horse blanket. It is still pretty smooth despite the intense tartness. Perhaps a bit of apple in there also. One of the driest beer beers in the aftertaste, perhaps almost a bit too much. Overall, a terriffic beer. 485 charactersdrseamus, Feb 08, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52007 Vintage. This beer is amazing, plain and simple.
Beer is yellow and slightly hazy. Forms large bubbles and a large but diffuse head of very large bubbles. Carbonation is steady and strong.
STRONG chardonnay like aroma. Very sour in the nose with a slight funk that becomes more obvious the more you smell.
Beer is medium to low bodied and has a slightly citric sourness to it. Nothing much in the forward but there is a definite and growing sourness in the back of the mouth. Drinkability for this beer is really high and mouthfeel is great. Lots of carbonation on the tongue contributes to the overall sourness and feel of this beer. I'm in love. 655 charactersdrabmuh, Jan 25, 2010

4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Popped and poured into Lost Abbey chalices at Toronado. It gushed after popping the cork. It was hazy golden yellow, a healthy amount of foam and good lacing. There is a strong aroma, with plenty of citrus and some nice funk. The taste is fantastic they are notes of citrus, lemon, pineapple, some nice bitterness, some oak, that hoarse blanket goat cheese flavor, the strongest flavor is the tart sourness. Its exquisite in it's balance and complexity. It has a nice carbonation and it goes down very easy. It's amazingly drinkable. you could sip it all night! 561 characterssomabeer, Jan 23, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 version, at Toronado, so glad to finally try it. The first pour was a little hazy and light golden colored, but each successive pour was a little darker and murkier. Judging by aroma and taste, this is exactly what an American wild ale should taste like, at least in my humble opinion. Musty sour barnyard funk, some lemon, this is really not that far from some of the best gueuze I've had in Belgium. Lost Abbey may have some bad press due to carbonation issues on high gravity ales, but they absolutely have wild ales by the balls. The sour bite never infringes on my enjoyment, maybe because it's expertly crafted, or maybe because of severe acclimation to the style. It truly sucks to like something so much when you know you can't easily get it. This will always be on my WANTs list. At least there's Cantillon to hold me over... 839 charactersTurdFurgison, Jan 23, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into a Duvel tulip. Opened with a loud pop and the corked rushed out of the bottle. No LA carb issues on this one. Good looking front label and good tribute on the back to the Toronado. 2009 version. It was a hazy golden yellow with massive carb streams from both the etching and throughout the beer. It had a 2 finger white head that very slowly settled into a constant foam cap fed by the carbonation. Great lacing with a lot of it sticking on the sides.
The aroma was amazing. Sour, funky, lemon and other fruits, wood and yeast. Not as much horse blanket as others but still one of the best smelling wild ales out there. Was constantly swirling it and taking huge inhales. The taste was also exceptional and followed the aroma. Great sour bite from the start that never lets up before the near eye puckering finish. Great fruity and wood balance to offset the sour. Again, one of the best wild ales out there. Mouthfeel was tart with lots of carbonation and a dryish finish.
Overall, a world class wild ale that earns all the hype and high ratings. Highest recommendation - you must try this especially if you love wild ales. A bitch to find but so worth it. Rotation - not avail in TX. Extremely rare release. If I could, I'd have a bottle constantly in my fridge and cellar. As is, I'll keep searching for a trade as well as having at the Toronado-San Diego during my soon to be annual trips out there. 1,454 charactersTexIndy, Jan 20, 2010

Pours a clear golden yellow with a big creamy white head that hangs on for a while and leaves good lacing.
Aroma is fairly funky with some barnyard aromas and wet grass but the most dominant aroma is the light fruity sourness. Overall, the aroma is what I'd call bright - lots of light tartness with less earthy funk.
Taste is exceptional, lemon zest up front with bready malts, some fruit, maybe pears and green apples, light vinegar. Fairly funky finish but light so with some lemon. Sublime taste, super complex, more tart than funk.
Light bubbly mouthfeel, very citric and biting. Crisp and wine-like in the finish.
This is a superb American wild - well balanced but still nice and sour. I wouldn't put it in the same class as the T20, but it's still a great beer. 819 charactersgford217, Dec 31, 2009

Poured into a Carolous chalice.
Hardly any white head from the pour. Color is a very hazed orange pumpkin hued sunset color.
Aroma: very funky and sour. Notes of honey, crisp flavors. Leather, some horse blanket, and bright fruits. This beer is making my mouth water.
Taste: Very sour and funky. Horse blanket and leather. Tart cherries and fruit flavors. Sweet honey in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Very sour and tart. Mouth pukering. Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends a little tart but overall, very clean.
Overall, a very nice wild ale. Nice and sour, just the way it should be. I could go for a lot more of this. A very well done sour. I hope I can try a fresh one of these in a month or so when I visit Toronado.
2014 vintage. Bottle at the T.
Golden yellow. White head that fades quickly. Bottle shows carbonation though. This one is funky and sour. Has the wet horse blanket but is very fruity. Sour cherries, peaches, apricots, and Granny Smith apples. Lots of acidity. Little vinegar. 
Mouthfeel is kind of bubbly. Lighter feel to it. Ends clean.
Overall, just a great sour and I really would rate this vintage very similar. Maybe a little less mouth puckering, but this bottle is being consumed fresher. 1,252 charactersmothman, Dec 17, 2009

Sunshine through the fog, a languid yellow/orange liquid that's foggy, yet light. The cloud-puffs on top linger for a moment or two, then drop away.
We've been running back and forth in the back yard, we children, pretending to attempt to catch the fog, though we know in our hearts that we have already arrived. So what can you say of the aromas? Immense lemon-citrus, a minor funk note overridden by the sheer tartness, but there's also a clean, tearful metallic rainwater note that simply makes one imagine what the angels must be taking in as they float along through the clouds in all of those old paintings...
And the flavour does not disappoint whatsoever, a mouthfeel that is clean, light, dry and bubbly, melding perfectly through the wash of flavours that are simply heavenly, the immense tartness and sour that is somehow still very, very approachable and very drinkable. The citrus notes still dominate, there's a flash of sweetness on the palate and just a touch of an old barnyard, along with the dense rainwater fog that we breathe in as we run, huffing and puffing and dreaming of heaven.
We'll continue to try to catch it, catch the fog, but we will never understand what it will be like until we're there, gleaming white robes, the airy, tearful metallic tartness that reminds of sunny fog, rainy sunshine, the most beautiful days on earth. 1,480 characterskhiasmus, Dec 16, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This was the 2009 vintage on tap @ the Toronado (San Diego, CA) on 11/11/09. Special tapping of the '08 and '09 during San Diego Beer Week. This was a pretty generous 8 oz pour (especially compared to what is looked like some people got of this) served in a tulip glass. 
Pours a hazy rosy copper, with a thin covering of brite-white foam. Retains mostly with some froth around the edges, leaving a moderate smattering of lacing behind. Nice look here. The aroma is sharp in the nose with fruity citrus, that has a touch of acidity to it. Sugary and doughy sweetness fills out the middle portion of this, while I'm getting a good bit of slick woody barrel notes on the backend. Mostly though, this is all about that vibrant smelling fruity tartness. I could stick my nose in this all day. 
The taste is straight up bright feeling citric tartness, with a touch of vinegar on the edges, but this never gets souring at any point during the glass. That same mix of sugar and bread from thh aroma gives off a cookie dough vibe, that when mixed with the citrus, has that same fantastic SweeTart character that I'm finding more and more in some of these top-grade Wild Ales. For me though, the backend of the profile on this is what makes it. Vivacious citrus notes of apricot, grapefruit, and lemon rind, that blend into a dry lingering oakiness which hangs on the tongue. Just a lovely, lovely, finish here. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with just a beautiful feeling mellow creaminess to it that runs the whole way through the swallow. Some slippery woody slickness runs underneath but the carbonation that runs on top of it is just some of the most smooth and easy that I've felt in quite some time. It's not wonder that I'm rapidly losing liquid as I review this. 
I had the opportunity to try some of the '08 next to this and I must say that I think I prefer this fresh, as the citrus is more pronounced and the funk hadn't yet started to overtake it. That said, this stuff is the real deal, and I feel very fortuitous to have been able to try this on draft. I think that there might certainly be some comparable Wilds out there that are a bit easier to get but by no mean pass this up if you get a chance to try it. 2,220 charactersKegatron, Dec 09, 2009

Clear golden yellow color with a slight orange hue with a quickly dissipating white head, leaving only a ring around the glass. Lactic acid and citrus in the nose. There's some funkiness to it, but I get more tropical fruit than anything else. Lightly spicy on the tongue with some barnyard funk and a little bit of tropical fruit. As it warmed in the glass, the tropical fruit remained, but more of a foot-like Brett character came through. Medium high carbonation with a dry finish. Drinkability is exceptional; easy to drink a bunch of this, though availability won't allow it. Flavors aren't all that intense, but they are refined and lead to a good drinking experience. 699 charactersbadbeer, Nov 27, 2009

Pours a hazy light gold color into my tulip with a small white cap. Leaves impressive lacing and has decent retention.
Aromas of lemon zest, barnyard mustiness. Over-ripened peaches and wood, I've got wood. Some lemon rind and slightly buttery. Various floral spices and a dash of vinegar. Taste follows this funkiness and acidity are in a nice balance, after an initial sweetness. In my tasting notes, I have written "transgender vaginal funkiness". I'm not sure who was experiencing that at the time, but what a wonderful descriptor. 
Great mouthfeel, nicely carbonated (!) . Very drinkable and I'm glad to have the chance to try this one, but I think that I like DDG better, not to mention how much more attainable it is/was. 851 charactersIneedabeerhere, Nov 26, 2009

Horse blanket, some citrus, wheat, and nice brett ect flavors. 08 was just flat in flavor and funk, maybe more mellowed. hadn't had 08 when it was 1st released so maybe on release it was like the 09 this nite. would say hold 08's if in bottle for a later date for the funk to develop with more time. 578 characterspaytoplay, Nov 13, 2009

I have just recently gotten into sours and wild ales and I know that this was a very special treat for me to be able to try this. The intital taste is sour, but goes away with a warmth feeling. A touch of a salty taste to it, but not very predominant. This beer by far exceeded any expectations I had for it.

4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 1 sampled 11/2/09. Not hype. One of the best, if not the best, sour beers I have ever had. If this was a gueuze it would be #1 for the style. People like to poo-poo lost abbey for largely personal reasons, but batch 1 isn't even near its peak in my book.
Appearance: Nice pour, two inch cream head, decent lacing. Bit of chill haze. The beer itself is a straw hazy amber with a touch of copper.
Smell: Very pleasant funky, sour aromas. Perfectly funky actually. Much more funky than any other Lost Abbey beer, and by far the best one. Wood, leather, earth, mushrooms, farmhouse cheese, and lemon. Very small bit of vinegar. Incredibly complex.
Taste: This and Rick James are the gold standards of funk. It does not get any better. Sour, but not overwhelmingly so. Lemon, vinegar, and a nice bit of oak and funky farmhouse cheese, cardamom, cloves, green apples, pears, bit of peach. If only I could drink this every day. I took the sediment on the second pour, it was opaque, different, and even more enjoyable. Incredibly complex beer. It is more mellow than you expect, but after a few sips you realize that is what makes it perfect. This isn't an attempt to make the funkiest beer, or the most sour beer, it is an attempt to make the best funky sour beer.
Mouthfeel: Nice medium-full body. Incredibly smooth, ABV is not noticeable.
Drinkability: Off the charts. Why is the bottle empty?
I hate to repeat myself, but this is the perfect execution of funk. More than any other beer, but it is a higher quality funk as well, if that makes any sense. Very approachable and tasty. This batch seems to be doing quite well, might be the best of the three. As I drink it all I can think is "this is how a beer should taste." 1,731 characterscraytonic, Nov 07, 2009

A-Slightly hazy golden copper with a thin white ring that leaves spotty lace. Looks nice but nothing impressive.
S-Light vinegar, more musty in the aged version, dry oak with a dose of tart green apple.
T-Spicy, tart, apple cider vinegar, oak dryness. The sourness is in check but prevalent adding more to a sharpness than a puckering aspect.
M-Light bodied, crisp, tart and sharp with a drying, astringent finish.
D-Highly! This is quite delicious. Not too tart, not too dull...a wonderful amalgamation of flavours. A highly regarded sour for a reason--fine stuff. 791 charactersDeuane, Nov 03, 2009

S: Smelled a little funky. To me it came across as a wild heavy wit. Very wheaty nose. Then comes the brett and the overipe fruit. Different than many of the other wild ales I have had.
T: Very nice bright fruit taste with the funk coming in later. Again I got some wheat in the front. The tartness really sneaks up on you. You definitely get the lacto as it has that nice burn towards the back.
M: So nice and refreshing. Could drink this all day.
D: I was pouring for Lost Abbey during BBF and I kept drinking this. I had the duck and yellow bus and sinners but my glass was constantly filled with this. I though this would be much more sour. It is more balanced than I thought it would be. 874 charactersaerozeppl, Oct 23, 2009

Pours a dark golden ripe banana color that is slightly murky with a one finger off-white head that quickly fades into a lasting ring. There is very minimal lacing, only small spots here and there.
Very funky aroma with some nice barnyard, horseblankety goodness. Lots of crisp golden fruits, apple, pear, grape, etc and a nice dusty earthy oak character. Just the smell of this beer made my mouth water. I literally sniffed my glass for several minutes before even taking a sip.
This beer has a perfect balance of intense puckering tart barnyard funk, horseblanket notes, slightly lactic and acidic but not too much so. Tart and sour intensity up front that settles into some beautiful light crisp golden fruit notes. Hints of apple, pear, grapefruit, light grape followed by more funky brett oaky sourness which lingers into the amazing mouthwatering finish. Very dry yet sweet and crisp with an amazing crisp dry tart puckering finish. 
This is an amazing beer that for me truly lived up to the hype. It is just a perfect blend of tart/puckering sourness, crisp delicious fruit notes and a dry sweet yet tart delectable finish. This beer tasted better with each sip and my mouth was literally watering in anticipation of each sip. This is one of the most complex, flavorful sours I've ever had and I cannot recommend it any higher. I only wish I had more. 1,536 characterscorby112, Oct 06, 2009

Also had Batch 2 out of the bottle at a Toronado Belgian-inspired beer dinner. I know this is blasphemous, but I consider this beer to be very overrated and only a little above average for an American Wild Ale. I think the rarity of it plays into the high ratings a bit.
A - Slightly hazy golden color with a white head and decent lacing.
S - Funky aroma with Brett, wood, and dry white wine.
T - Very sour and funky with lots of lemon, unripe white grapes, and barrel notes. Fairly one-dimensional in my opinion and does not really stand out above other beers in this style.
M - Soft carbonation, medium body with sharp sourness on the palate and a mouth-puckering finish.
D - Well, the sourness, while not too intense, gets to be a bit much in this case, and I don't think it's all that drinkable overall. Oh yeah, and it's way overpriced at $45 a bottle. 911 charactersnickd717, Sep 10, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I have waited a really long time to try this beer, Some might say too long, But never the less, this was no easy feat to track one down. That being said I was graciously able to acquire through a wonderful west coast friend who took pity on my plea. The was a 2008 vintage bottle, served out of the cellar at around 50 degrees and poured into my darkness snifter, let the games begin. 
As I pour it out, I have to admit I am a bit nervous here. Maybe it is the high expectations I have for this brew, perhaps the preconceived notions are getting to me, no matter. Pours out a very nice and cloudy orange tinted amber color. I could not see through the glass when held up to the light. Nice fizzy head rises quickly to about an inch and a half and then faded away into the night, leaving an almost bare top, well after a few minutes it was a totally bare top. Some light carbonation could be seen inside the glass and a good bit of sediment getting stirred up in the bottle. 
Aroma is a tar bomb off the bat, but not enormously sour. Much more complex then then that. Light notes of citrus, orange, semi sweet notes as well coming though as it warms. Deep horse funk apparent as well now. So I go in, for my first sip of Cable Car, and I have to admit it is much more mellow then I thought it would be. Seriously though, I was expecting this deep, wretchedly sour ale and this was not the case. It was remarkably smooth, almost sinisterly so. Deep funky notes predominate, with early touches of white grapes and tart apples. Soo damn smooth though. A bit light on the carbonation in the feel, left me looking for a little more, but damn the taste is unreal. Cannot really compare it too much else. It is just amazing drinkable. The first glass went down like water for me, but half way through the second the ABV starts to kick in and I am feeling it as I type this for sure. Still though I find myself wanted to take bigger and bigger sips, it just that smooth. The finish had to be the driest I can recall with all moisture being sucked from the palate almost immediatly.
Overall wow. The taste was just out of this world. It could have used a bit more pop in the carbonation and appearence but that being said it was still unreal. Super damn drinkable and just absurd. Worth the hunt as I cannot compare it to anything else. 2,329 charactersmikesgroove, Sep 10, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009, batch 3, 750ml bottle.
Poured into Duvel tulip.
A - Pours a mirky golden/light copper color. A nice, fluffy, white head quickly follows on a medium-aggressive pour. A nice, frothy, sticky lacing stays behind from the head. Once held into the light, I can see loads and loads of bubbles rise to the top of the glass from the etched "D" on the bottom of my glass. Overall, something to look at in awe and appreciate.
S - Once I popped the cork, I could smell the tart/sour notes from a couple of feet away. Once I brought the glass to my nose, it wanted to turn inside out, just as I imagine my lips will want to do in a few minutes. Musty brett, stanky cheese, lemons, barnyard funk, sweet tropical fruit. All of this combines into an awesome-smelling wild...something to sit back and enjoy for a bit before you taste, lots going on here and probably more then I can pick up.
T - Lip-puckering tart that hits you right off the bat and then mellows out into subtle lemon-esk tingle. This is so damn good, words can hardly describe it. Lots of funky barnyard/brett mixed with some semi-sweet fruity notes. Not too tart/sour which gives you a chance to delve in and enjoy some of the other flavors going on. A nice semi-sweet finish that I don't think I can recall in any other sour I've had. A very complex wild.
M - Light to medium bodied, but it sways more towards medium but not quite "medium" (sorry if I'm confusing here, hard to explain). Very full, but light at the same time. The carbonation is right-on here, a nice fizzy tickle on the tongue that helps open up the flavors. A dry finish that makes you come back for more.
D - This beer makes you sit back and appreciate it. It's easy to drink fast, but why? It's great to chill out while sipping on this from time to time. I don't want this bottle to end, but I'm glad I was able to pop this one open and enjoy. Lost Abbey, you have done it yet again! 1,919 charactersSean9689, Sep 10, 2009
3.92/5  rDev -12.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Tasted at Cleveland tasting on 8-23-08. Thanks!! Batch 2 was poured with a golden color and thin white head. Has a slight funk aroma, some citrus, and some spice. Has a medium body. Taste is tart, some fruits, and has a sweet sour finish on the back end. Overall I was expecting more from this beer. Considering the hype around it I found it did not live up to the hype. Its a solid brew, just not worth the ratings it gets here. And I wasn't the only one with those sentiments. 478 charactersfiver29, Aug 21, 2009

Appearance: Pale orange/yellow. Surprisingly good head retention.
Smell: Tart, vinious, grapes, champagne(ish)
Taste: same as smell w/citrus tartness goodness overwelming. Spices I can't put my finger on. Cinnamony? Dry finish such as white wine or champagne. Absolutely easy drinking and delightful. 
Overall: Solid, and excited to have the privilege to try it on tap for $5. 417 charactersbret27, Aug 16, 2009

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Chris and Joey for bringing Batches 2 and 1, respectively, to the tasting we had on 7/25/09-7/26/09. We found batch 1 had gone downhill a bit so I decided to focus my notes on the current better of the two, batch 2.
The beer appears hazy orange with a small fizzy white crown that recedes after a minute.
The aroma opens up with vibrant citrus in the form of lemons, orange, and apricots mixed with just the right amount of Brett. The Brett imparts a nice level of mustiness as well as a little barnyard funk. The nose has a distinct tart quality to it. 
The flavor is bursting with lemon and orange with a nice medium level of tartness. Some nice Brett notes are evident, but once the Brett doesn't impart any deep funk notes like cat piss or wet horse blanket, but rather a slight musty barnyard element that seems to accentuate the soft citrus. The finish is orange and lemon with Brett, some acidity, and a lingering sourness.
The beer is light bodied with a medium level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is dry with some acidity.
The 2007 batch has noticeably declined since I last tried it. I laughed at the thought before we opened the batches side by side, but it truly is the case. The 2008 is clearly the better of the two at this point in time. 1,267 charactersHopHead84, Jul 29, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From 750 mL at Toronado SD-
A: Poured into tulip. Cloudly gold/yellow and bright in appearance with a 1/2 finger white head and minimal lacing. 
S: I've never smelled a beer like this. It smelled like saddle leather, white pepper, and a hint of fresh mint. Honestly, it was like smelling a Crozes-Hermitage, except for the mint part. There was only a trace of the green apple, which was abundant in the mouth.
T: Green apples and lemon, with a trace of mint in there. Like a white wine, almost. Very persistent, cleansing acidity.
M: Medium in body and possessing fine cut and palate-cleansing character. Carbonation is light, which works OK.
D: About 7%, and it is not boozy. Could drink another of these. 
Really unique in my experience. Thanks to Chad for purchasing and sharing this. 793 charactersnectar14, Jul 18, 2009
4.46/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Shared by Treyrab at our coveted Graduation Tasting.
Pours a very gold light brown that shines ever so perfectly when held up to the light. A spotty white head floats atop, which leaves slight remnants of lacing behind. Very beautiful haze, and a darker then I was expecting the body to be. 
The smell contains tons of bitter lemon, and is fairly sweet. There is a lot of grapefruit in this scent as well, which is a followed by a nice orange tartness. Vanilla and horse blanket lay secondary in the background.
The taste is awesome. My palate picked out tart grapefruit, orange and lemon. The beer is a really nice dryness to it, which really plays well with all that is sweet and kickin'. This beer reminds me slightly of Sanctification, minus the cherry. It is a little bit lighter then some of the other wild ales we have tried today which deters the mouthfeel score. The dryness continues to linger well after each sip. The vanilla is very soft and hardly noticeable as sticks out most with warmth. There is also a funky cheese taste that plays well with all of the other flavors. Not to keep playing the memory game, but this also reminds me of a carbonated version of 3 Fonteinen's Dosjel with carbonation.
Really glad I got to see what all the talk is about! 1,270 charactersCoolJosh, Jun 18, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have now had this three different times and it is definitely time to review it, I have had it on tap at Toronado in San Francisco back in August, bottle of batch two shared at a tasting a few months back, and recently 750 ml bottles of batch one and two side by side courtesy of Ian, this review is a mixture of both of those bottles which I had last week, reviewed from notes, each were poured into a tulip glass
A-Golden orange color with some highlights, thin 1/2 inch very bubbly white head, good retention for a sour and the head does not go away for about five minutes, very nice wine-like legs, some lacing at the top of the glass 
S-Lemons, peaches, grassy accents, grapefruit, earthiness, other citrus, strawberries, funkiness, brett, pineapple, green apples, leather, oak, grains, herbs, light peaches, cherries, limes, and tons of tropical fruits, one of the best smelling beers of all time
T-Flavor has so many different fruits that it just sends your palate on a joy ride, starts off tart and ends that same way, has a huge underlying citrus backbone, love the grainy and rustic feel in the middle with that nice funk to go along with the sourness, that is what really separates this beer from the rest of the field, it does not blow you away with crazy amounts of tart, instead it is more balanced while still maintaining a great sour feel, never overpowers you, gets more complex as it warms and the granny smith apple flavor become awesome by the end, can go on and on about this beer's taste but hopefully this gives people a better idea of what to expect
M-Lively carbonation, medium bodied, zesty, sour, tart, citrusy, and fruity mouthfeel, taste lingers a long time but you never want it to go away
D-I could drink tons of this and I have, had three glasses when at Toronado, it is amazing because you cannot taste any alcohol and it is no lightweight at seven percent, very light on the stomach even though it is pretty acidic, this stuff is very refreshing and taste good both chilled and warm
Rating #1,300, I will admit that I have enjoyed the first batch a lot more than the second, it was more aggressively sour while the other batch was more subtle and mild, still mouth puckering though, I wish this brew was not only available at one place in the world because I would drink it all the time if that was not the case, this is worth all the hype indeed, this is truly one of the best sours I have ever had and probably will ever have, hopefully Tomme brews this for Toronado in the upcoming years because it is well worth the seven hour drive up to San Francisco to buy some, this brew is a masterpiece, cannot recommend this enough 2,663 charactersFloydster, May 25, 2009
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Consumed at The Graduation Tasting. Thanks, Trey!
A: Crystal clear with a light, thin head that recedes rather quick. Plenty of carbonation.
S: Funky, tart, more so than Sanctification. Mild sweetness with honey. Definitely lemony in character, I really can't help compare it with Sanctification. Cheesy funk with mild floral and honey character. There's also a certain sharpness I get from the aroma that makes me think back to the other LA beer I've had that have this character - I used to think it was from the cherry skins, I'm not so sure anymore
T: Opens up quite tart and sour with clean funk. Barnyard, intense lemony sourness. Slightly more sweetness and vanilla. Finishes dry, tart and awesome. Mild acidity with a certain sharpness. Some oak and cheese. Awesome
M: Light, effervescent carbonation and excellent finish
D: Very very easy to drink a ton of this
Notes: I tried this again in July 2009, side by side with batch 1. I initially laughed at the thought of batch 1 being over the hill given it's rather young age (2 years), but sadly, it was so. On the nose, it was dank and musty, with a surprisingly woody note, reminding me of wet wood. There was also a slightly spicy character with cloves and cinnamon. On the palate, batch 1 was a lot more tannic and woody, while batch 2 was more vibrant and citrusy. Batch 1 would get 4/4/3.5/3.5/4, while batch 2 is pretty outstanding. It's gotten more sour, and is extremely enjoyable.
Update 2: Thanks to Joe (Ineedabeerhere) I got to try batch 3. Sour and funky with apple, pears, wet wood. Great stuff, this is sourer than either of the previous batches. Mildly grassy. The palate opens sour, surprisingly so with sour lemon with a mild lactic and acetic character. Almost simple in flavors, there's some grassy, fruity character with apples and peach before a dry, sour lemony finish. Great stuff (S/T = 4.5/4)
**Edit 01 July 2012**
Thanks to Chris or Jay for trading me this bottle. Shared at our Lost Abbey tasting.
The nose is very nice. Mildly melony, moderately lemony, moderate funk, earthy, loam-like, complex and very well structured. Makes me think of a real gueuze in its delicacy. The palate opens mellow, complex, funky, earthy, lemony. Very, very nice. 4.5/4.5/4.5 2,251 charactersDefenCorps, May 21, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a medium gold with some clarity. The off white head is minimal and sticks around for a minute or two before disappearing to a thin cap. Lots of lace stays in the glass. 
S - Starts out with tart green apple and unripened cherry. Hints of white bread and alcohol midway. Alcohol doesn't get in the way at all. Pretty funky and musty toward the end with notes of wet hay.
T - Tart apple and cherry really pop at the start. Some oak / wood comes in about midway. Hay and grass are present as well. Might be some pale malt and honey at the end. Alcohol is warm and complimentary overall. Very nice flavor and complexity going on here.
M - Lighter bodied with a nice carbonation level that just tickles the palate. Finish is tart and persistent. Creamy and smooth overall.
D - Drinkability is very good. The strong flavors and overall complexity just keeps you coming back for sip after sip. This one goes down surprisingly easy. Lost Abbey has a winner with the Cable Car. It would be nice to see this one become more available in the future. 1,052 characterscsmiley, May 12, 2009

A: Pours a glowing orange with a nice, frothy white head. Very nice orange and lemon color matched with the white head. Looks great.
S: Very tart, very geuze-like, with tons of lemon and oak with a funky cheese, and musty smell. Very complex, but not as complex as the darker sours in my opinion, like Deviation. Also some great white grape and white wine notes.
T: Immaculate. Very tart lemon and white grapes. Slightly vinous with white wine, very nice dry oak and slight cheesy funkiness. Very nice.
Overall, this was an incredible beer! 668 characterstreyrab, May 11, 2009
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge, huge thanks to mba3243 for trading me a bottle of this brew. After being invited to taste with Beerloco and d0b I had to step up and find something worthy to bring to the table, and this gem just sort of popped up (after probably way too many pleading beermails to Mark). This was the '08 vintage (batch 2) and was served in my Kuhnhenn tulip.
A - One finger of off-white foam with lovely lacing. A pleasant hazed golden apricot color. Not the most interesting looking brew, you'd never realize what it was just by looking at it.
S - Holy funk Batman! Tons of brett, horse blanket, white wine, sour apples, oak, and notes of graham cracker sweetness. This is up there with the best Belgian gueuzes in terms of being delightfully funky but not out of control.
T - Sour apple, vinous and oaky, cider vinegar, and plenty of earthy funkiness evocative of stables, barns, and bales of hay. This is one of the rare brews where I didn't experience much drop-off from the smell to the taste. Dave astutely pointed out that it was similar to Isabelle, and after having a taste of IP late in the night I'd be inclined to agree.
M - Smooth, velvety, moderate carbonation, dry, woody finish from the oak-aging, and some of the cottonmouth tartness. There's a slight warmth that wasn't present in Deviation (which is only .57% lighter in ABV).
D - There is a touch of palate fatigue that sets in from the funk and sourness, but I'd still have few problems putting down an entire bottle. The last bit of the bottle had an almost milky consistency from the bottle-conditioning, but still tasting just as good (we weren't letting any of this stuff go to waste!).
After having landed this white whale I'm not certain I'd give up as much as I did again - however it was still worth it to try this rarity. I'm wondering how different this is from the first batch, as the rumor has it that the original recipe was never recorded and batch 2 is a "re-creation". This is a superb wild ale, it just had the misfortune of following up the sublime Deviation and paled a little in comparison. If our sour lineup was analogous to the LotR trilogy, this would be The Two Towers. 2,162 charactersMasterSki, Apr 26, 2009

A - Poured a hazy golden body with subtle carbonation and a thin, wispy white head that dissolved to a patchy film and left sparse lacing. 
S - Citric notes with a sour apple character and a mild band-aid aspect. Dry oaky notes with a moderate tartness reminiscent of sour grapes.
T - Moderate tart and sour notes with apple and grape notes and a mild woody presence suggesting oaky, earthy notes. Finishes with a white wine crispness and a prevalent sour character. Finishes with a dry, tart sourness on the palate.
M - Medium bodied with a slight syrupy texture and lively carbonation. Dry, tart and crisp finish on the palate.
D - One of the better Wild Ales I've had thus far. Big thanks to akorsak for pulling out this 750ml before I had to leave his tasting on Saturday afternoon. Great stuff! 926 charactersffejherb, Apr 19, 2009

A- golden, slightly cloudy, sudsy white foam.
S- Sour, like these lemon Quench Gum I have, only very light phenols and other funky compounds from the yeast. The acid is pretty prevalent on the nose.
T- A nice balance between sour and sweet. Not a ton of yeast character that I could detect in the taste, compared to say a Sanctification or a Cantillon Geuze. Not as dry in the finish as those either, this one finishes with a lot of sour and a little bit of sweet. Kinda like a sour candy.
M- Light, but at 7% there is some body with it. Carbonation was moderate to high, plenty for the style.
D- Tasty sour, not sure I fully understood it in my 6 oz sample to be able to rank it relative to other great sours I've had, but it was a good beer. 833 charactersMiScusi, Apr 08, 2009

A: Nice hazy golden yellow with orange undertones. Thick white head, which leaves some nice lacing on the glass.
S: Lemony acidity, funky, malty bread-like aroma, nice earthiness. This is a wonderful smelling sour. You can tell this isn't going to be over the top. Nice balanced aroma.
T/M: Excellent stuff. Nice sour fruit and strong earthiness. Funk isn't over-dominant, kept in check nicely. Not too sour. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied. Nice strong carbonation leaves a dry finish. Very refreshing. 
D: Very drinkable stuff. 
Overall, an excellent sour beer. Between this and the Phunky Duck that same night, I see why people believe Lost Abbey makes some great sours (I think some of their other more well-known sours are overrated, personally). 
Just crazy stupid that this thing cost $50 at Toronado, though. But I was willing to split with my friends once in order to give it a try. 971 charactersabfraser, Feb 22, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The last, and least worthy, of the four from this wonderful occasion to submit my review. 
An emergency beer tasting? 
If it involves Cable Car, you betcha. Slightly damaged during shipping, beachbum1975 (thanks Shane!) insisted we consume it within a day or two. Forget about the ice storm and the law telling people to stay off the roads. This was an emergency of Cable Car proportions. 
Shane was tight lipped about the beer. It was intended to be a gift for pwoods (Patrick). Shane's message - it's rare and worth the urgency. FtownThrowDown (Steve) rounded out the special occasion. 
I requested we drink the first half blind. 
Poured by Shane into an oversized red wine glass. Presented to me with a hazy straw color and beautiful golden hue. Sensory overload with aroma, color, and foam lacing. I'm guessing my pour was around 5 ounces with 1 oz going to my wife. Review from the wife; "this is good!"
The suspected shipping damage had little impact on the mild level of carbonation (or did it?). Once in a lifetime. I'll never really know. The quest is officially on. 
My notes contain the standard comments on this style - tart, sour, light citrus, and dry. Looking back over my notes, two observations were made separate of the rest - thick and straight up. I observed thickness, in the form of mouth feel, that I'm not accustomed to with sours/wilds. Straight up is another story. I was searching hard for complexity in the yet-to-be-revealed rare beer. Searching too hard to enjoy. To me, Cable Car is a phenomenal balance of the wild, sour, and funky combined with light and fluffy...at a loss for words here. Smooth, easy-drinking Cable Car. On a hot summer day I could drink myself to death.
When the curtain came up, the biggest surprise to me was the barrel aspect. I suspect this may have more to do with leveraging bugs than major & noticeable enhancements to the flavor profile (think Supplication).
Like a wedding video, I'm purposely avoiding documentation on this beer because I want it to live in my memory as I remember it - a special beer that rewards beer exploration. 2,104 charactersYetiman420, Jan 30, 2009

Check this: I shared this one DURING A LEVEL 3 SNOW EMERGENCY in Cincinnati with yetiman420, pwoods and ftownthrowdown. If this wasn't beer advocacy in its' finest moment, I don't know what is!!! 
(Also, I forced all my BA buddies to review this beer, also!)
750ml brown bottle corked and caged. Cork removal was graceful... The cork had just the right amount of pressure to make a muted pop as I opened it. My notes were taken on the fly during a brief tasting in Yetiman420's FANTASTIC beer cellar/museum! Thanks, again for hosting!!!
Pours a murky, yet bright golden with orange hues. Great, spotty lacing and a white head with small, highly compacted bubbles. Average head retention leaving a nice 1/8 inch skimming of foam as I drank.
The nose of this one was an interesting and complex mix of vinegar funk up front, followed by moderately sour cherries and hints of green, tart apples. 
Following the nose, the taste was a mellow blending of lemon tart, ripe green apples, light assorted citrus, sour cherries finishing with a light vinegar twang/funk. Light bodied and full flavored with ample carbonation throughout. Flavor doesn't linger long, leaving a slightly sour and dry, almost refreshing finish. Pleasantly sour (not a sour bomb like Isabelle was)...
Though my tasting history of American Wild Ales is limited, this was the smoothest and most approachable wild ale I've had so far... 
Oh, and for the fella that hooked up me, pwoods, Ftownthrowdown and yetiman420 - THANK YOU (you know who you are!)!!! You can't get a much better gift for a BA friend's review milestone... 1,679 charactersbeachbum1975, Jan 30, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle shared very generously by Shane. Enjoyed with the company of Shane, Chris and Patrick. What an evening! 
Pours a very hazy, murky, light gold in color. There's a nice sheen of froth sitting atop the beer. It stays throughout the entirety and leaves webby lacing that falls as the level of beer recedes in your glass. 
Smell is sour, light fruit and has many wine-like qualities. Plenty of oak and tannins appear throughout. Taste is sour, but not lip puckering sour. Very balanced and damn near perfect if not perfect. Unlike many sours that are unbalanced and so puckering that your mouth implodes, this one is amazingly balanced and dangerously drinkable. You really have to hold back drinking this beer. The quandry of thoroughly indulging in the beer and knowing in the back of your mind that these may be the last sips of this fabulous beer you ever have.
I could drink this beer all day long and never tire of it. One of the rare beers that truly lives up to and exceeds the hype. Which speaks for itself.
Big thanks again to Shane for sharing. A truly one of a kind beer, with just as amazing company and atmosphere.
Cheers! 1,139 charactersFtownThrowDown, Jan 30, 2009

And anyone that has ever let it known that they've had a bottle knows this as well. I've offered well over $100 worth of very rare beers, many brewery only release and plenty with less than 1000 bottles made.
I've been drinking beers with Shane(beachbum1975) for the past 8-10months or so. We both trade way more than we should. We've always 'unspokenly' tried to one up one another. Well that mother fucker one upped me to end all one ups... but that doesn't mean I won't stop trying :)
This bottle was a belated Christmas gift and presented to Chris(Yetiman420), Steve(FtownThrowDown), and Me(and of course Shane), as a blind tasting for my 500th review. That bastard also just traded for a bottle of the beer I was getting him for a belated Christmas gift. What a D-Bag!
I honestly cannot express my thanks and gratitude, Shane. This was my Holy Grail beer and now my Lost Abbey bottle collection is finally complete, and what's a better way to do it than with a Tomme Arthur signed bottle of Cable Car! :D
750ml corked and caged brown bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Shared with 3 great BAs.
A: Pours a very murky under ripened grapefruit peel color. A decent sized head forms and holds for a minute or so before falling to a few bubbles. Some spotty lacing throughout.
S: Loads of tart fruits. Lemon, orange, grapefruit, apricot, pineapple, cherries. Some astringent acids from the fruits adds to the tart and sour aromas. Funk is minimal but still lightly present with a touch of wet hay and maybe some light cider vinegar notes.
T/M: The tart and sour fruits are spot on to the nose. Lemon, pineapple, orange are more dominant with cherries and apricot or peach playing more in the back. Really a citrus explosion that is odd in that I normally experience this with loads of bitterness, which this obviously doesn't have. Funkiness is still at a minimum but still retains the wet hay and light cidery notes. I don't think it'd hurt to have some more funk. Tartness really starts to build toward puckering as it quickly warms. Some rustic woody and leathery notes form the barrels. Nice light to medium light body with perfect carbonation. Great dry finish that isn't too tart or abrasive. 
D: Extraordinarily drinkable. I could drink this all day every day. The tartness and sourness doesn't linger too strong or long. Very good. Yet again, many thanks to you, Shane. You really made my day and you better watch your back when it's your turn to be given a milestone beer! And a million thanks to the one that traded this to Shane ;) 2,644 characterspwoods, Jan 29, 2009

A - Pours one shade darker than straw, with a thin white head that fades as fast as it appears. Little in the way of lacing.
S - Funky! Potent, cheesy horseblanket hits first. Citric lemon & orange zest in the back.
T - A mild, zippy tartness introduces notes of lemon, grapefruit, and tart green grape. Funk abounds, with an earthier, dirtier profile than the nose led me to expect. Oaky.
M - light bodied. A bit lacking on the carbonation; not as lively as the best sours. Oak tannin keeps it super dry.
D - I was definitely left wanting more, but not in the desperate, pining way I expected.
I had set the bar extremely high for this one, so I suppose a letdown was inevitable. A killer sour beer, but not head-over-shoulders better than other similar sours from LA or RR. If it must be checked off your "to try" list, by all means seek it out. If not, stick to the easier to find sours. 987 characters0110x011, Jan 17, 2009

Awesome beer and my favorite sour thus far (rivaling Castleton, Supplication, and Beatification).

4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A rare beer that lives up to its reputation. Pours hazy gold with an oily white ring. Lovely perfume nose, sour mash, brett, and butter. Quite sour up front with a rhubarb flavor. The sour slowly turns into a buttery dinner roll. Tannins and oak along with a bit of cheese show up, too. Very acidic at first, but mellows into a nicely vinuous beer. 348 charactersmagictrokini, Dec 12, 2008

750ml bottle, corked and caged. batch 1. sampled nov 27/08.
pours hazy orangey amber with a small semi-dense white head. the head drops fairly fast and leaves no lace.
aroma is great. horse blanket. bit of leather. lemon. cider vinegar. sour cherry. grapefruit. multi-grain bread. bit of cracker. bit of nutty character too.
taste is great. tangerine. orange peel. lemon. grapefruit. light funk, less than i expected from the aroma, with a big malty base hiding underneath. multi-grain bread, cracker, light grain. bit of alcohol. bit of malt vinegar. some dark fruit too.
mouthfeel is great. medium carbonation level. just over medium body. a little fuller bodied than i expected.
drinkability is great. while the bigger body and solid malty base were unexpected, they really helped hold it together. a great balance between the funk, sourness, and malt. top notch stuff. if only i had more! 1,045 charactersgrub, Dec 11, 2008

Fairly clear orange/peach colour, turned cloudy once the dregs were poured. It had a thin, whitish cap that produced thick and spotty lacing. Sharp aroma, lots of tart and vinegar character. Sort of earthy with some funk, leather and lemon zest, fruit tarts even. Very smooth. Big fruity tartness in the flavour, earthy raspberry seeds, leather, a bit juicy. It did have a solid malt base, caramel and bread, but this was really there just to provide balance for the craziness. Medium to light bodied with average carbonation, just a bit of dryness. Delicious. Very smooth and balanced, highly recommended. 702 charactersDrJay, Dec 08, 2008

Pours a hazy pale golden yellow, thick white head forms, drops a bunch of lace spots on the glass, settles to a medium sized ring, looks nice. Smell is great, very acidic, charred wood, vinegar, lemon juice, fruit, very funk, leathery, alcohol, mangoes, acidity burns the nose a bit. Taste is nice too, sour fruit up front, vinegar, wood, sour mangoes, honey/caramely malt, bread, very acidic funkiness in the finish, very sour. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, very nice, burns going down, very acidic stuff. Great sour, nice woody character, Lost Abbey can do no wrong.

4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A- Pours a hazy straw-gold with hardly any head.
S- Dry champagne, brett, herbs, and mild notes of white pepper.
T- The first couple sips are very sour and it appears to be a ton of brett, but the complexity of the beer extends far beyond the brett. A mild funky barnyard flavor compliments the tartness without dominating at all. Notes of apricot and green apple mingle in the background.
M- Very clean finish, yet somehow the sourness lingers pleasantly behind.
D- It seems ridiculous to rate the drinkablility of this beer as no one will ever have the opportunity to try it as a session beer. 599 charactersJoeMayo, Nov 11, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Golden and cloudy, with a bit of head that fades to a thin whispy layer. Smells pretty sour, without too much barnyard funk, and with a little peach and green apple. Taste is very sour at the start, but fades to a complex and fruity finish. Carbonation is well balanced and does not detract from the beer, and it goes down smoothly. I'm lucky to have tried this after never really thinking I'd even see one, and I wish there were a chance of me tasting it again. 462 characterstprokop7, Nov 08, 2008

Poured a medium and lightly hazy (darker haze as we got towards the bottom of the bottle) golden color with a smaller sized off white head. 
Upon the first whiff, I was greeted with a plethora of incredible aromas that instantly put me in that 'special' place in my mind! I could smell this one all day and night long. Aromas of cherries, grapes, apples, funky, brett, light yeast, citrus, and vanilla. All the aromas melded together perfectly. I was also getting a light spiciness, maybe cinnamon. 
Tastes of tart green apples, citrus, woody, light yeast and vanilla. Light and soft body.

4.87/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to cloudskipper for this Batch 2 bottle. Shared with bgramer last night. Pours bubbly hazy yellow with a small layer of foam on top. Aroma begins with green apples, lemon and barnyard; pineapple, wood, light banana, cobweb; musty and more funky as it warmed up. Flavor was lots of green apple, tart grapes, lemon, subtle funk at beginning; slight oaky tannins, banana, and a slight alcohol bite as it warmed; slight corn in after taste. As it got completely to room temp it was like juicy ripe pineapple and got more sweet overall. It coats the mouth with tingly bubbles and leaves a lasting impression on the palate. I absolutely loved this one; it had so many layers and subtle flavors/smells. 702 charactersthickerfreakness, Oct 09, 2008
4.15/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Toronado in August. This is a pretty tasty sour beer. I was very impressed. Hazy golden color with solid white head. Taste is crisp and tart, fruity, oaky, and sour. Funk is certainly present, but not excessive, which I appreciated. Considering the style, which I generally can't drink too much of, I was very impressed with this, and look forward to opening up the bottle I also purchased on Toronado's 21st anniversary night. 437 characterswaltonc, Sep 29, 2008
3.8/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had three 2 oz tastes of this beer at the Night of the Funk. Itwas the first beer I tried as I was real excited to try this rare beer before my palette was destroyed my the the onslaught of funky beers. 
It was straw yellow with white fluffy head that dissipated very quickly. Typical wild ale smells. Barnyard smells and a crisp clean nose. Not as much Brett as I would have expected. The beer was pretty mellow and drinkable. A good American take on a blended wild ale. 
I will say I did feel that I was a bit let down. It was good but it by no means blew me away. This may be a beer that is real over hyped IMHO. I can think of 4-5 Belgian Geuze that I would grab before this one that are much cheaper and readily available. Maybe this would improve with age?? 767 characterstendermorsel, Sep 27, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this at Port Night at Toronado the week after their 21st anniversary party. This is batch #2, the 2008 one. I had a couple. Pours a totally opaque golden with almost no head and some spotty lacing. Carbonation level was fine, though. perhaps somewhat on the soft side but entirely within a normal range. The aromas are fairly light, nut a light funkinesss comes through as a does a clean sourness and a tang of brine. The taste is much more impressive and oddly addictive. There is a delicious savory component to the beer that is hard to place, but includes a tangy saltiness that really blends well with the funkiness and sour. It reminds me slightly of sprinkling salt on crab apples when I was a kid to make the sour and tannic flavors more palatable. Their is a nice soft funkiness up-front and some mellow sourness throughout. There is a bit off butterscotch here as well and a nice jolt of tannins in the finish. Complex, intriguing, and delicious. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly tannic. I really enjoyed this on tap, but haven't tried it from a bottle yet. 1,074 charactersGeorgiabeer, Sep 07, 2008
4.16/5  rDev -7.6%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Batch 2; Sampled August 2008
Funky, cheesy and sour notes are quite noticeable as I pour this brew. An average pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces an almost two finger thick, pale, white colored head that leaves some lacing on the sides of my glass. This has a little chill haze and a touch of permanent haze to it; it went into the cooler with only a slight haze. The beer is a murky, light amber color as it sits on my desk, but it shows an orangish copper hue when held up to the light. Wow, this is much more funky than I was expecting it to be, more funky than just about any other Lost Abbey brew. Ample butyric acid aromas of old, dried sweat laden blankets and cured leather are joined by funky-woody mushroom aromas, some definite farmhouse cheese notes (though this is somewhat soft), uriatic cat pee, fresh scraped lemon zest, oxidized peanuts. This is all anchored by spicy, tannic oak notes that linger in the background of the nose, but are quite noticeable once you get past the funk. Some fruitiness seems noticeable at times, but at others is drowned out by the funk; when noticed, aromas of ripe pear, white wine vinegar, hints of kumquat pith & zest, . This has a very complex, very funky aroma that has a significant, but not overwhelming oak character that seems to be a bit more pervasive than I originally thought, but as a supporting role.
The first sip is quite dry tasting, it is not quite as mouth puckeringly sour as I was expecting, based upon the aroma, but still has a nice tartness to it. My first sip definitely leaves me thinking that this needs to have a harder sourness to it. The carbonation is at a light-medium level; persistent, prickly and noticeable, but not any where near the effervescence of sparkling Gueuze (which seems to be a rarer and rarer thing now a days, even amongst the classic Gueuze producers). The flavor also seems a bit cleaner than the aroma, though it is definitely tart and funky. The acidity here seems predominantly lactic in character and reminds me of tart grapefruit, some lemon zest, a touch of vinegar-like bite in the finish. Other flavors that round things out are a slight, funky cheddar cheese note, something a bit like smoked almonds, a touch of saltiness (tied up in the previous note), a definitely tannic finish and some light, spicy oak notes there as well. This somehow picks up a perception of sweetness to it, though I don't think there is much in the way of residual sugars in this beer; it almost seems to be acidity based. Light and quaffable, this beer also hides its alcohol quite well, which makes it all that much more drinkable.
My second pour of this is a touch more yeasty, which seems to soften the tartness a bit and also adds some raw, fermented dough notes (though only just a touch) as well as enhancing a cooked bread like character (sour dough to be sure though). I easily polish off this 750ml bottle, though there is enough acidity to make my empty stomach feel a bit rumbly. Worthy of the hype that I built up in my mind? I don't know, but it is definitely worth the hype to try it. It could use a touch more carbonation as a beer like this could always use a lively carbonation in my book. 3,211 charactersGueuzedude, Aug 28, 2008
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 vintage on tap at Toronado SF.
Appearance: Straw-colored, turbid and completely opaque, almost milky. The thin white head doesn't last long, receding to a ring after a few minutes.
Smell: Wonderfully funky; barnyard, horseblanket, rotten fruit, lemons. Absolutely full of funk.
Taste & mouthfeel: Sour, lemony and funky as hell. Acidity is low, and there's not a lot of vinegar-like flavors, which make this possibly the most drinkable sour beer I've ever tasted. The mouthfeel is bone-dry, and the finish is surprisingly clean.
Notes: Drank far too many of these on tap at Toronado's 21st anniversary party. Great stuff. 630 characterslargadeer, Aug 10, 2008

Aroma is very tart with red and dark fruits, oak, and spicy sweetbread. Epic complexity. Flavors of pie spices, yeast, lemons, vanilla, apple brandy, and some funky must. Palate is dry even without a lot of carbonation. Drinkability is very good considering the tartness. 376 charactersillidurit, Aug 05, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to Jwolfie70 for his incredible generosity over the weekend. Had a chance to sample this along with some other rare brews, as he cracked open his cellar (it took some cracking) to break out some of his Cable Car, Cuvee de Tomme, and other delicacies.
Pours a hazy golden yellow, maybe a hint (just a hint) of orange in there. Given the alcohol content, surprisingly long lasting white foamy head. 
A funky beer, but not an overly sour one (and we had some true sours over the weekend). Oak-y, musty yeastiness, a ton of overlapping citrus and unripe fruit flavors, and overlaying it all is that funky funk, which Jwolfie70 likened to "horse manure, but in a good way." Not the description I would use, but I'll add it here.
Not the be-all and end-all of beers, but something truly unique and all-too-rare. Could drink all day. A wonderful carbonation level really lightened it up.
**Tried batch two of this. Seemed like more funk/oak, less complexity. I think the first batch was much better, and given that Tomme informed me (IIRC) that the original recipe was not retained, I can't help but think the second batch was an approximation. 1,153 charactersOverlord, Aug 04, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Tomme for opening a few bottles of the new batch of Cable Car (batch 2) for the RateBeer event.
Poured a golden color with minimal head...nothing too fancy but decent for the style.
Aroma of green apples on the nose, funk, sweet pale malt, yeast, sour pear, and an odd spiciness. Now, I have not encountered such a spiciness in other sour beers, this one smells like a bread or bread dough with spices. Starts to get more fruity as it warms up.
Taste of dough, spices again, ripe pear, various tropical fruits (but not too fruity), spicy bread, and sweet oak. Tastes very young and definitely needs to sit some more. Less spicy character after it warms up. Sweet cracker taste in the finish. 
Slightly syrupy but soft with some carbonation in the back.
Needs to develop some more but tasting pretty good right now.
I also tried the first batch tonight but I didn't take any notes, it was definitely a bit more tart, had less of the spicy character and was a bit more yeasty. Definitely gets better with age.
***update 7-27-09****
Had the opportunity to try batch 1 (2007) and batch 2 (2008) at the "You Bring the Cheese Tasting" on July 25-26th 2009.
I was very interesting to have both vintages side-by-side. I had not tried this one since last year. The surprise of the tasting was that the batch 1 (2007) Cable Car was not doing so well. 
Batch 1 had a weird tannic and muddy flavors, as well as a stronger spicy oak flavor. Batch 2 also had the spicy oak flavors and aroma but more balanced and a cleaner tartness.
Good to see that batch 2 is holding up fine and could age a bit longer, I will keep my bottle for as long as I can and see what happens. 1,676 charactersseaoflament, Aug 03, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A 750 mL corked and caged bottle (Batch 1) graciously shared by the one and only spacecoyote.
A: The ale is a hazy golden color, a weizen-like melange of sediment and goldenrod. The head held up well through several glasses.
S: The aroma is funky, but not as tart as I expected. A wide array of fruits pop up throughout and add a varied sweetness to the ale.
T: Man oh man! I was expecting the utmost in tartness, the end-all be-all of face pucker, so I was mildly surprised by a reserved tartness that strikes up front and supports the the fruitiness throughout. After the mild tartness, the fruits make themselves known. Apricot, green apple and lots of grapefruit mark the fruitiness. The grapefruit is most memorable, as it is not hop-driven. The finish shows off the flavor, a tart sweetness that really bites at the taste buds. The mix of flavors is incredible, a magnum opus.
M: The mild tartness is refreshing, not so strong that you can't handle repeat sips. The tart fruit flavors are divine.
D: I almost passed out when Carl pulled this one out of his cooler. It is easily one of the most drinkable sour ales that you'll come across. 1,149 charactersakorsak, Jun 14, 2008

Golden. with a small white head, minimal, but nice lacing. Aromas are super funky sour barnyard like beatification on crack. Super sour almost bile like with a wonderful wild and wiley yeast portfolio. Light, buttery, and wine like. Not unlike a smooth cantillon gueuze. Probably the best gueuze like wild ale ever produced by an American brewer. 449 charactersfrancisweizen, Apr 03, 2008

4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Much thanks to Phatz for sharing this rarity of a gem.
Appears a hazy, light gold with a small white head that slowly fades into a mild cap. Lacing is scattered all over the glass like tiger stripes. Streams of CO2 quickly rise to the top.
Smell is of caramel, candy sugar, vanilla, barnyard, funky must, cinnamon, and cardamom, with a touch of apple.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas that meld together in a lemony zest, citrusy, sweet, funky, and tart blend that tantalizes the tastebuds into craving this different but enticing brew.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, full of candy orange, funk, with a dryness covering the palate with citrusy zest. 654 charactersweeare138, Oct 15, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to metallitone1 for providing Phatz with this beer. Shared very graciously by a great host. Cheers!
Appearance: Golden in color with a moderately sized white head and lots of apparent carbonation. Lacing is generous and clingy.
Smell: This is what sours are made to be. Brettanomyces and other wild yeast strains make a wildly complex aroma that is profound. Overripe apples, lemon peel, freshly baled hay, orange rind, barnyard mustiness and freshly ground pepper. Quite endearing.
Taste: Wow. These wild yeasts are superb at creating complex flavors. Lemon, hay, funky tart sweet apple cider, allspice, coriander, citric acid, blood orange, and fresh peppercorns. I''m sure you could pontificate all the flavors that arise because of the shear complexity of this beer. Five for flavor.
Mouthfeel: Pretty much everything a wild beer shoudl be. I found it to be bubbly and lively like a champagne, with an alcohol presence to remind you of its strength. Most importantly, this beer is sour and tart in the forefront and midground but finishes with a soft and supple swallow that furthers the already complex nature of it.
Drinkability: This beer certainly lived up to all the hype that surrounds it. I feel lucky to have quaffed it with other knowledgable advocates of beer. If you are a fan of sours, this is your nirvana. Seek it out at all costs and please share some with me. A bombshell of a beer. While I am hesitant to give this beer all fives, I do not think there are others out there that will match its complexity and well rounded aromas/flavors/mouthfeels. Each area is like a yin/yang of sour/sweet, sour/soft, fruity/spicy which is more than can be said for other beers that can present themselves as superb one dimensional beers, but not all encompassing. I would consume this beer with any meal and feel confident that it would pair well. I'm eager to try it again. I want the remaining 99 bottles. 1,931 charactersRisser09, Oct 15, 2007

A better man have only walked the earth once, since the beginning of time. Tim you a great man and good friend, and I feel honored to have made your acquaintance. I sure hope Tomme Arthur makes more of this beer. It is worth the price you need to pay whatever that may be. I *love* sour wild ales and this is a masterpiece. 
This beer is quite different from but as good as Supplication [also provided by metallitone1]. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to share this beer with Hopdog, egajdzis, weeare138, froggyfrog, and Risser09.
Appearance: Pours a clear golden color with magnificent lacing on the walls of my snifter glass. The head is slightly off white and the carbonation is lively.
Smell: It has a huge bold sour cherries and Brettanomyces funky aroma that flood the nose with aged lambic like acidity is that the Pediococcus, I believe. Who cares! It is sensational. The citric rind, apple-cider vinegar woodyness and the plethora of magnificent indescribable aromas left me salivating like a dog. 
Taste: How could the flavor live up to such a grand aroma? IT DOES! Sourness, abounds with fruits and sweet and tart flavors that run the gamut. Apricot lemon cherry wood and large sour apple with a funky yeast and Lactobacillus presence that gives its spectacular sour attribute. It makes my mouth pucker in pleasure on each and every sip. There is a spice element clinging to my cheeks in the aftertaste, like cinnamon, vanilla and ginger along with the sourness. Each tastes beckons the next.
Mouthfeel: The sour sting and the light carbonation a fairly acidic body give this a very lambic-like mouthfeel. Dry and long-lingering.
Drinkability: If the Egyptians had it right with their tombs; I want my sarcophagus placed in a conditioning tank full of Cable Car so I can drink it for eternity. Otherwise, I am certain this will be the flavor of my heaven. This is a beer I could drink day and night, if only it were available. 
Hope this is helpful.

Smell- A bit of lambic style funk...damp basement. Couldn't quite get which fruits were in the nose, but they were citrus and fresh.
Taste- Tremendous fresh and tart fruit basket. Tangerine, orange, cherry, apricot and lemon. Not violently sour like some Cantilion brews, but a nice tangy tart flavor like La Folie, but maybe more like Love. 
Mouthfeel- Light carbonation, lingering tart aftertaste.
Drinkability- Damn I hope they decide to bottle this. Probably the winner of the night for me. One of the best sour beers I have ever had. 830 charactersGClarkage, Aug 14, 2007
