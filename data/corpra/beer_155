Taste starts with tart, unripe apricots, stonefruit skin, acidic fruit juice, really dry finish. Light body, really dry, medium carbonation. Overall it's a great, fruity sour. Very refreshing and easy drinking. 312 charactersCiocanelu, Apr 08, 2017

Look - moderate head that disappeared fairly quick, fairly thick body, light orange / dark yellow color.  Sexy
Smell / Taste- a lot of oak and interesting fruitiness to go with the apricot burst.  That interesting fruitiness I not know is the pinor noir barrels because I thought this was just oak barrels.  That definitely explains the complexity that really puts this beer on another level.
Feel - perfect level of tartness while the flavors just soak into my mouth and linger so nicely.
Overall - amazing beer.  Glad I have a couple more. 603 charactersrabbott2, Apr 03, 2017

Smell is tangerine, nectarine, and lemon--bright!
Taste is really tart grapefruit, tangelo, and cranberry. I have to say, it's so bright and tart, I think the apricot kind of gets drowned out by the work the microbes and oak are doing, unless these are particularly bright and citric apricots. It's not a bad thing though, this is pretty standout stuff.
Semi-dry with a slight sting on the tongue mid-palate. 523 charactersSabtos, Nov 08, 2016

4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75An overwhelming blast of apricot and oak up front. It's actually quite difficult to get past these two very distinctive aromas as they're very unapologetically in your face, but some subtle hints of lemon zest, barnyard funk, and milky caramel-like lactose surface with some time. Bretty notes of horseblanket and hay intensify as the brew gets even warmer.
Whether or not the SARA had this specific vision in mind, I think the beer itself is an embodiment of the Apricot as a whole, from the inside out, in terms of the flavor. Allow me to elaborate.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The first impression that the beer imparts on the tongue is mouth-puckeringly tart, as if you're sucking on a whole apricot pit by itself. Before there's any time to dwell on the sudden sour influx, a nice juicy apricot wave with a supporting cast of lactic acid and oak--this is the flesh of the apricot. The brew has a well-rounded sweet fruity finish, reminiscent of juicy nectarines, much like the sensation you get when you chew on the skin of the apricot.
Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. The abundance of fruit in this beer really accentuates the creamy mouthfeel that SARA magically imparts upon their ales; at one point I could have sworn there was milkshake traveling down my throat as opposed to a very well-made American Wild Ale from a town that people from Santa Cruz go to when they need clothes that aren't hipster or from the Salvation Army, since Santa Cruz is adamantly reclusive about allowing corporations and non-local into the town. 1,534 charactersamano_h, Oct 17, 2016

A: Hazy, vibrant, glowing gold/orange in the glass. This is a beautiful looking beer that looks like pure sunlight. Little to no head (a few medium soapy bubbles) on the pour, but a thin ring of tiny bubbles sits on the edge of the glass. A few wisps of lacing with some alcohol legs for sure.
S: Big musky funk character accompanied by HUGE tart apricot notes. More prevalent oaky pinot noir aroma fades as it warms, succumbing to the tart, juicy fruitiness. Bits of lemon and citrus, but nothing overly acidic.
T: Tons of tart apricot up front. The apricot notes change tremendously as it warms, becoming sweeter and incredibly juicy. The final sips tasted like straight apricot juice--absolutely insane. Bits of musty, cheese-rindy funk, but mostly just zesty, tart, juicy fresh fruit. Apricot is, of course, dominant, but but supporting roles are also played by green apple, lemon, and peach. 
M: Medium bodied feel with bright, effervescent carbonation that glides across the tongue. Not a particularly creamy beer, but the unfiltered nature of the beer adds a certain weight to it. It has medium plus sourness, but nothing overly acidic. It's quite dry from the start yet so clean, making for an extremely drinkable sour.
O: I feel slightly embarrassed to say it, but this is one of the first sours I've truly sat down to enjoy and review. But damn, am I lucky to have such a perfect introduction to the style. An incredible balance of tart, juicy fruit, oak barrel, and musty, rindy funk blends with an effervescent yet delicate feel to provide an incredible drinking experience. For such a sour beer, West Ashley is refreshing and clean enough to go down very easily. Looking forward to delving deeper into sours moving forward! 1,769 charactersavas, Sep 13, 2016

4.36/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25On tap at the source in Capitola.  To me, this was basically Saison Bernice with apricots added, aged in oak.  It is a pleasant combo.  You have the base saison adding a full body, nice carbonation / effervescent mouthfeel, slight funk, lacto.  This one is quite tart, but I wouldn't call it sour.  The apricot addition wasn't that apparent in the nose, but it did round off and pair with the base saison and oak flavors very well.  I was surprised to find out that this was aged in a pinot noir barrel, because I didn't pick up any specific presence, just oak really.  It goes down with a significant tart bite, leaving your mouth dry and aftertaste of tart lemon, oak, and hint of apricot.  I really enjoyed drinking this and would happily have again.  But, jesus it was a pain to get over here from the peninsula and unfortunately that means it will be a long while since I enjoy some SARA treats again.

Appearance: It poured a hazy golden straw colour with a minimal white head and sparse lacing.
Aroma: An initial whiff of something that reminded me of tuna salad followed by tart, apricot, berries, funk, grass and hay.
Taste: Sour, tart, apricot, raspberry and cranberry.
Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
Overall: My first SARA beer and it was a very enjoyable and refreshing sour. Now I really want to get my hands on more West Ashley and other SARA beers if possible. Just not so easy for me… 682 characterskitch, Sep 09, 2016

A touch sulfurous on the aroma, definitely getting those apricots. It is soft and restrained while providing ample apricot character. There is a touch of bready, wet cereal, cheerios on the finish. Just a touch. Overall, a really good apricot sour and one that I had on my personal whale list for some time. 400 charactersSheppard, Jun 05, 2016

Color is beautiful, bright apricot. Aroma is apricot, lemon, wine barrel, slight bread and funk. Taste follows the nose. I was surprised by depth of apricot flavor since it wasn't the most recent batch. It's very sour with a full mouth feel and perfect carbonation. Everything about this beer is right on point. Definitely worth the hype. 442 charactersdanh53, May 28, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this with the wife to celebrate our second wedding anniversary. As such, perhaps the perfect 5 also has to do with the atmosphere. However, I simply could not find a fault in this beer. (I haven't reviewed many beers, but this is the only 5 I have given. I do understand that some people would never give a perfect 5, ever, but it's hard to find a really hyped up beer like this that fully lives up to it, and then some.)
Hazy, sun-like orange-yellow with minimal head. The aroma was one of my favorites of all time; even though this bottle was acquired via trade and I believe was the batch prior to the latest, it was still bursting with juicy apricots. However, as great as the fruity aroma was, it was the funk that I loved most about it (which perhaps had benefited from the age). Even my wife likened it to taking of a horses saddle, although we had ridden earlier in the day so that could have influenced her olfaction :-) The taste was ripe apricots, musty funk, and finished with the just the right amount of puckering tartness. A full body supported by adequate carbonation with a perfectly dry finish.
Again, I can understand that some folks might frown upon ever giving perfect 5s across the board. Of course it is always easy to deduct a bit for color or on mouthfeel, but this beer was absolutely beautiful. 1,327 charactersmoose1980, May 26, 2016

4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Nice orange presentation yields a good 1/4" white head, hits with lots of citrus notes, orange pulp, apricot.  Lots of lactic sourness and a minimal amount of french oak.
Bursting with orange colored fruit, leans more apricot than anything else.  Very juicy, fruit content is top notch.  I love Fou Fune, but there are seriously good albeit admittedly different apricot wild ales in the States that are plenty worthy.  This is right there among Cascade, Map of the Sun and Filmishmish.   I don't really grasp on this beer what makes it a saison moreso than a wild ale, its definitely sour and is so sour its difficult to see it otherwise.  
Whatever you call it, its a tasty beverage. 686 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 05, 2016

S: Juicy apricots, peaches and tart fruits
T: Naturally the apricot steals the show with this one and makes a decidedly tasty statement complemented  by a slight tart funk
F: Balanced if not a little bit light on the mouthfeel
O: I enjoyed this beer immensely; West Ashley has an impressive tart flavor that still allows its fruit base to shine. Even my wife, who hates beer, liked this one. The apricot/fruit taste is not overly sweet (like a Peche 'n Brett can be), but extremely balanced. The whale status surrounding this beer is well earned, but as other reviewers have commented there are several other comparable beers (e.g., Fou' Foune, Logsdon, Side Project) that might just be a bit easier to land for us living on the other side of the country. Not sure if I'd seek this out again, but I certainly savored this bottle. 912 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 21, 2016
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It took a while to track this beer down, largely due to its west coast whale status and the majorly inflated trade values created by the Bay Area hype trolls, so I am glad that I finally located a trader who would go dollar for dollar on this bottle. 
The taste is tart, funky, and lightly fruited with a dry finish. 
Overall, a very well balanced and enjoyable beer. It would probably taste better with a bit more tart and a lot more fruit, but that would then become a different beer. 
Now having tried it, I have no real need to revisit this beer for quite some time. For what a single bottle of West Ashley commands in a trade, I would be better off trading for Fou' Foune (which is a better beer) or drinking two modestly priced shelf Allagash or Russian River sours. 775 charactersrodmanfor3, Feb 21, 2016

4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A- Pours a light, bright, and mildly hazy straw-yellow in color. A very smell head of about 2 millimeters forms and hangs around only a little while before being reduced to a bit of film and bubbles on top of the beer. The body of the beer is mostly hazy, but does retain some translucency when held to the light. Not much lacing as this one is drank, which is expected with the lack of much head.
S- Huge, juicy, and lightly tart fruit smacks the nose right off the bat. The apricots are really the star of the scent right up front before a bit of funk and light mustiness kicks in during the middle of the smell. Wild yeast imparts a touch of light, fresh cut hay to the scent right after the initial apricot tartness. On the back end, the fruit returns, this time with a lighter and slightly sweeter impact to the scent, leaving out the sour aspect its first appearance has.
T- As this beer hits the tongue, the flavor follows the scent closely. Tart and fruity hits first, with the characteristic 'seedy' tartness that many stone fruits display. The tartness is moderate in strength, providing enough punch to not quite make you pucker. Apricot juiciness comes right after the tartness and turns the flavor primarily towards the fruit. The middle of the drink sees the light funk from the scent make an appearance, although it is even more subtle in the taste than it was on the nose. Light hay gives way to more juicy fruit goodness that leaves apricot juice lingering on the tongue well after the drink ends.
M- On the palate, the weight of the beer is rather light, but doesn't quite reach the 'fluffy' impression that many beers of a similar style display. The carbonation is fairly high, as expected. Alcohol is not a factor, either in taste or weight of the beer. On the whole, the beer feels like a glass of carbonated fruit juice.
Overall, this is really a world glass fruited saison. It borderlines on tart enough that it should just be considered a sour. The beer displays both moderate tartness and light funk with a ton of the apricots mixing in there. Seek this one out and try it if you can. 2,113 charactersboilermakerbrew, Feb 08, 2016

S: opened with plain barnyard, a little disappointing. But as it warmed out of its tenure in the fridge it developed a fantastic amount of complexity for a sour of this sort: green grape, green apple, some apricot, lactic acid, barnyard funk. 
T: basically the first time seeing Star Wars. I mean COME. ON. It starts with a lactic bite, finished with a punch of apricot and barnyard funk. As it warms it belies a dusting of cinnamon and cardamom. This is really a symphony of flavor in the best way; everything is working together, advancing the thesis of this beer. 
F: somewhere squarely in the middle of the dryness of a Belgian lambic and the creaminess of something like Love Child No 5. A lot to work with. Nicely balancing. 
O: this is my new favorite sour. A sour, by definition, at least in my head is not balanced. It skews to one side of the oral Richter scale. This, however, is of another sort. The first truly subtle and nuanced sour I've ever had, and I wouldn't be shocked if it was the last. Basically happy faced emoji and dancing girl emoji. 1,238 charactersNizzleEGizzle, Jan 19, 2016

Pours hazy golden body, aroma is lactic tartness, stone fruit, slight farmhouse funk. Tongue matches the nose with lots of apricot / stone fruit on the follow through - not as acidic as I thought, more balanced fruitiness with a nice pulpy aftertaste with some barrel in there as well. Medium carbonation and body. 
Overall delightful, a true masterpiece. 415 charactersgcamparone, Jan 04, 2016

Thanks to Joe-Mahma for sending this one over in a trade!
A: Crystal clear, very light pale straw yellow with over 1 fingers width of bright white head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves a few patches of lacing.  4.25
S: Oaky, tart, funky.  Lactic acidity, plastic-like funk notes, very subtle sweet fruit notes. 4.5
T: Puckeringly tart on the first sip.  Tons of lactic acidity, nice oaky notes.  Like the nose the fruit is fairly subtle, but is present on the back end and balances out the sourness nicely.  Not much funk, just some burnt plastic characters.  A very nice wild ale.  4.5
M/D: Medium body, carbonation on the higher end but appropriate, drying on the finish, drinkability is excellent.  4.5
O: Very enjoyable beer.  Don’t think it quit lives up to the classics, but great beer nonetheless.  4.25 869 characterszac16125, Jan 01, 2016

Pours a golden orange color with one finger of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Nose is amazing, tons of apricots, funk, fruity malts, oak, floral notes, oranges, and light citrus. Taste has less funk, more sweet and sour fruits. Medium body and low to moderate carbonation, super smooth and easy to drink.
Overall a fantastic beer. I heard some people say they like this better than Fou Foune. I think Fou Foune is funkier and this is fruitier, with FF having that Cantillon Belgian funk, but can't go wrong with either. World class, would have to try 'em side by side to tell you which I like better. 679 charactersmdfb79, Dec 04, 2015

4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Late day sun in the glass. Medium nose for a fruited sour -- funk, fruit and skin. The flavor profile is nice, but fairly straightforward. Apricot, funk and a drying pucker on the backend. A bit of vinous barrel. A great beer, but lacks a bit of the depth of a Veritas 15 or Lou Pepe to push it into the very top tier. A little more barrel presence would add to the complexity. 377 charactersjjdc, Sep 19, 2015

Consumed: 8.8.15
A: 4.5 Pours a fairly hazy orange gold with a uniform off-white head.
S: 4.5 Lots of bright, fresh apricot on the nose, with some light acidity and lemon mixed in. Not much in the way of funk and not super complex, but lets the apricot shine.
T: 4.75 Even more apricot than on the nose; more fruit forward than Fou or Map of the Sun. Pleasantly tart without overdoing it. Finish is classic Sante mineral quality and pleasantly dry.
M: 5 Like Saison Bernice, they really nailed the mouthfeel. Really drinkable and satisfying with excellent carbonation.
O: 4.75 This beer really stays true to what Sante does best: bright, crisp saisons. The apricot just elevates this style in a way that is unique to them. The comparisons to Fou, Map of the Sun, etc. are fair, but West Ashley is a bit of a different in its relatively mild tartness and lack of funk on the nose. 904 charactersTele, Aug 10, 2015

This stays with you. Semi sweet, fruity, lemony, minerally, oak and lacto. This is solid although I'm not getting a lot of the apricot flavor. 100% not homerism, but Apricot Stonington has a better apricot flavor. This has more sourness. 247 charactersDavepoolesque, Jul 09, 2015

A: Cloudy pale orange body under a finger of fine white froth. Mediocre retention, light lace. Perfectly fine, but nothing memorable.
S: Powerful apricot fruitiness alongside intense lactic sourness. Straightforward and thoroughly enjoyable. 
T: Opens with tart stone fruit, followed by a zing of puckering acidity, and finished by a delicious mix of apricot and vanilla. Long, delectable aftertaste. Excellent.
M: Soft, light-bodied, and a little spritzy. Pretty nice for the style.
O: Terrific beer, and one that I felt very fortunate to get to try. It wasn't one of the top 3 sours at this tasting, though (De Cam Framboise and a couple Side Projects were decidedly superior), so I wouldn't give up my first-born to revisit this one, great as it is.

Light fizzy head fades semi quickly, hazy murky lemon yellow orange color. 
Nose is interesting, a lambic like funk, mild sour lemony tartness, a mild apricot juice, tangy apricot, mild genetic stone fruit, light generic funk, light fleshy peach and apricot. 
Taste is on, decent bit lighter peach, more like apricot skin and stem, light funk, light stone fruit, hint sour like funk, weird fleshy fruit not really much apricot, mild tangy with mild acidity. Weird orange peel bitterness too. Hint of toasted oak and vinous wine barrel like notes. Finish is dry mild sticky mild acidic bite, little flemmy, hint of apricot and stone fruit. Seems like the nice subtlties of the beer are lost in the funk and fruity notes. 
Mouth is med bod, decent but lighter carb. 
Overall a huge let down, just ok, not really sour or funky, not much for apricot or stone fruit, just average in general. No idea how this had such a big reputation. 986 charactersjlindros, Jun 27, 2015

4.06/5  rDev -9.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Shared with JLindros and Kyle.
A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice hazy golden hue with a thin white head that fades to leave thin wisps and a light halo.
S - Aromas of strong funk, good apricot flesh, candy apricot, little juice. Loads and loads of funk.
T - Taste is similar to the nose, lots of lactic funk, good nice tart apricot. Good funk levels here with nice house yeast. Pretty pleasant with light wine barrel notes. 
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, nice tartness. 
O - Overall this beer was a big let down. While it was good it wasn't the semi whale that people hype it up to be. Good beer but not the high trade it commands.

Hazy, straw yellow body with some yeast evident. Small, broken head. Lovely aroma of lactic funk and citrus. Orange, apricot, melon, assorted stone fruit with tropical notes as well. Juicy and delicious. Gently tart balanced my a natural fruity sweetness. Notes of pineapple, guava. Light in body and dangerously drinkable. Fabulous. 377 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 29, 2015

4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Most recent batch. A big thanks to Josh for this one. Reviewed at a tasting 3/26/15. 750ml bottle into a teku. 
Pours a .5 finger foamy white head with good retention. Beer is a cloudy peach. Lacing is stringy and spotty with good stick. Pretty nice.
Nose is apricot meat, citrus, and Brett funk with a mellow, spritzy tartness that livens the experience. 
Opens apricot skin and meat. Juicy and sweet in the middle with a foamy, Brett funk mixed with Apricot tartness. Some apricot skin towards the end and in the aftertaste. Very fruit forward and the tartness is not overwhelming. Great balance with a big apricot presence. 
Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and slick in the mouth and goes down aggressive and foamy. Puckering finish with a filmy aftertaste. Super drinkable and the moderate carbonation perfectly complements the fruit-forward flavor profile.
Overall a really balanced and mellow fruited sour that demonstrates that a clean flavor profile complemented by superior drinkability can really go a long way. Definitely worth trying. 1,066 charactersSpeedwayJim, Mar 27, 2015

4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Batch 5 into SARA tulip.
Appearance is hazy pale gold with a small white head leaving a thin ring around the edge of the glass.
Aroma is very fruity citrus forward, soft fresh flower and  slightly spicy brett phenols, oak, and hints of vinous white grape.
Taste is apricot fuzz, tangerine juice, sweet lemon, blood orange, hints of pineapple, oak, and the faintest white wine. Lovely apricot!
Mouthfeel is light, medium carbonation, very tart throughout but not sour. Drying on the finish with the oak coming to help that drying affect.
Like other fruited SARA Saisons this is not dominant on the fruit but just a very integrated and pretty complex farmhouse ale. As it warms the apricot comes out more on the nose and the taste gets more complex. Fantastic wild ale, love them apricots. 797 charactersMarcWP, Nov 29, 2014

Pours a murky golden-orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, apricot, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, apricot, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice sour apricot aspects, but it is also quite grain forward in my opinion.

4/5  rDev -10.5%Bottle: Poured a straw color ale with a nice foamy head with OK retention.  Aroma of sour and tart notes with some light funky yeast notes is quite nice. Taste is a great mix between some sour and tart notes with some funky yeast. Apricot notes a very subtle and kind of hard to distinguish. Pinot noir barrel lend a light vinous feel to the beer. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Enjoyable sour but I would have preferred more apricot notes to be upfront. 465 charactersPhyl21ca, Oct 10, 2014

Thanks to pushkinwow for the bottle!
Pours a golden straw color with a short-lived head leaving no lacing. Beautiful nose, tart fruit (peaches?), nice Brett profile, acidc, yeast.  On the palate, this beer is dry/tart, sours fruit, tight on the back of the tongue.  Really nice!!! 363 charactersmtomlins, Sep 29, 2014

3.9/5  rDev -12.8%Pour is a lightly hazed golden amber with a white head. Nose is lambic esq. Has some  dusty cellar brett, and nice notes of nectarine and peach. Taste is less lambic and more fruity. Not sour. Moderate carbonation and a creamy body. Bright peach, nectarine and some grapefruit. There is some dusty brett, gentle acidity, a bit sweet in the flavor. 347 characterscpetrone84, Sep 27, 2014

A- Pours a vibrant, cloudy pale orange with a fizzy finger of head that fades within a minute leaving a ring of head on the edges. Not much lacing here. Carbonation releases from the bottom throughout the drinking experience.
S- Juicy apricots/peaches with a faint sugary sweetness. Smells acidic with some biting funk as well as some oak in the background. Smells very bright.
T- Much of same on the flavor. Very crisp, clean, ripe firm fruit juiciness, with a bold sourness. Not quite as sour as Fuzzy, but it is quite aggressive. I like it. Not as much funk as the nose, but it is not missing.
M- I wish this had more body. I feel that a fuller mouthfeel would help the flavor to integrate better. Not that they don't, but there is room for improvement. It's slightly watery, and if this were not so, I imagine being floored by this beer.
O- This is an excellent beer, without question. The aroma is splendid, and the flavors are superb. A firmer body would tie it all together in near perfection. Glad to have had the chance to drink this one, and now know that SARA deserves the hype. 1,291 charactersjbwimer, Jul 16, 2014

The flavor continues with apricot puree throughout, a truly intense fruit flavor, a slight funk, a decent tart quality of lemons with a well rounded malt and wheat backbone.
Up there as one of the best American fruited wild ale. 374 charactersdar482, Jun 30, 2014

The beer pours a bright, apricot color, golden hues, opaque and hazy with a light finger of thick, off white head that has nice retention and leaves a big wall of lace behind. The aroma is full of juicy apricot, bretty funk, light pale grain, tart with light sourness, but the base beer, funky, yeasty, rustic and grainy, comes across very nicely. The flavors are great, beautiful apricot flavor, fleshy, juicy, plenty of funk, lightly musty but very fruity, almost berry like, earthy saison base, light lemongrass and rustic spiciness with soft pale grain. The tartness is spot on, not sour at all. The mouthfeel is great, perfectly carbonated, lively, zippy without any prickliness that coats the mouth superbly well, and finishes with a soft creamy texture.
Verdict: The fruit comes across superbly well, but the base beer is certainly not forgotten, complex, balanced and quite refreshing. Very reminiscent of Peche n Brett, in that the saison qualities are not lost. I really enjoyed this one and can't wait to have it again in the future. 1,152 characterskevanb, Jun 08, 2014

Pours like hazy opaque apricot juice. One inch head, no lacing really. No visible carbonation.
Heavy, fresh apricot aroma, with some underlying barnyard funk and acidity. Lots of apricot though is very nice.
Tastes include musty tart apricot flavor, acidity, barnyard funk, leather, oak, and apricot juice. Medium to high sourness.
Light to medium bodied, tart and crisp mouthfeel. The sourness really lingers on the palate and lips after each sip.
A bit too sour for my (virgin) sour tastes, but this still had a lot of great flavors that I could enjoy. 616 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 05, 2014

Review #498.
App- Hazy orange body that looks like orange juice with pulp, nice one finger white head with a normal pour with normal saison retention (which is a lot) and lacing. Beautiful beer.
Smell- Holy apricot funk. Not much acid, but a lot of sweet tangerine/orange citrus flavors and a bit of barrel funk. Not super complex like a Belgian geueze, but so interesting and delicious just the same.
Flavour- Very good! Lots of fruity apricot character, with some tannins and a bit of funk. Not very acidic, maybe 3/10 vinegar, but drinking incredibly well. Like the nose, not as complex as the Belgian counterparts, but not gonna lie, this is really tasty.
Mouthfeel- Crisp yet creamy medium bodied beer that is incredibly refreshing. We drank this between 2012 BADL and Murda'd Out Stout, and this appropriately cleansed our palate in the most enjoyable way. Tart, crisp funk mixed in with some apricot juice on the backend.
Overall- One of the best American fruit sours/saisons I've had thus far. Jeez! So much more delicate yet flavourful than the likes of Chez Monus and Atrial Rubicite. It's up there with New Glarus' Very Sour Blackberry in terms of the drinking experience. Sante Adairius is for real! 1,359 charactersStevedore, Mar 23, 2014

The beer pours a light yellow orange with a thin, white, tightly knit head that fades rapidly. The nose is a distinct shotgun of apricot to the face, some funk and and sour, little malt, no bitterness, touch of red wine and acetone. The taste is also distinctly apricot that is tart with just enough sweetness and has a lingering dried apricot finish. The beer's light bodied, true to fruit with layered barrel complexities, light-medium carbonation, and a mouthwateringly dry finish. This beer is quite fantastic, really nails the apricot sour profile. 617 charactersThePorterSorter, Mar 01, 2014

Smells tart, with oranges, peaches. It's so fruity. The taste is tart upfront and all peach and apricot on the back end. Sticks around in the mouth for a while after you swallow. Medium mouthfeel, almost no carbonation. Feels a bit heavy on the tongue, in a good way. I would like a little more carbonation, but my bottle may have been compromised in the mail. All the other flavors are there, though. Nice level of tartness here, very refreshing and meshes well with the fruit flavors. 583 charactersMikeypnh, Jan 12, 2014

Super turbid cumquat with a modest but game white head that eventually fades to a collar.
As expected there's big apricot, but displayed on a very sweaty, urine-y canvas. Plenty of funk and horse blanket and palpably thick acidity. Mild sherbety high notes keep it in check. If not for the heavy urine contingent it would be a glorious nose.
Taste displays more Pezzy, sherbety character. Uber tangy apricot, sweaty armpits with the classic lemony tartness poking through on the back end. 
Chewy body, but zingy and very spritely on the tongue. Pretty spot on for the style. 
Great stuff. Fairly simple concept but phat and delicious. 723 charactersspicelab, Jan 02, 2014

Batch 5
A massive thanks to Futura123 for sending me this bottle. 
Appearance: West Ashley pours a moderately cloudy bright golden-orange, with a rough pour yielding a good sized white head. The head retention and lacing are somewhat disappointing, but the brightness of the body is so beautiful I find myself not really caring! 
Smell: Oh wow, as soon as the cap is popped a ton of apricot aroma fills the room! The apricot notes are certainly on the tart side, but there is a touch of underlying sweetness apparent. Initially the funk is fairly restrained with only a light musty character noted, however as the beer warms the nose opens up and with mildewy notes, lactic, earthy notes, some woodiness and a slight off/dirty brett character. 
Taste: The initial flavour is pretty tart (more so than I expected) and chock full of fresh apricot flavour. There are light citric notes, lactic tartness, a little underlying sweetness, a musty character, earthy, oak, wet hay and a slightly sulfurous/dirty brett character. As the beer warms, the sulfurous character increases slightly, but it remains unobtrusive. Even at room temperature there is no trace of the 7%. 
Mouthfeel: Usually I would find the just-shy-of-high level of carbonation a little too much for my tastes, but it in this case it works well and makes the beer uber refreshing. The body is medium with a touch of stickiness from the fruit. 
Overall: West Ashley is a fantastic American Wild Ale and was the perfect beer on a hot summers day. I think a little tweaking of the funk profile (to limit the dirty character) will put this beer on the map as one of the best American sours. 1,711 charactersThehuntmaster, Dec 24, 2013

A: Beautiful glowing apricot body with a thin white cap. Leaves some slight dots of lace after each sip.
S: Tart apricot skin, peaches and cream, restrained barnyard funk, dried apricots, leather and very light oak.
T: Opens with a fantastic pull of tartness, full of underripe apricot, meyer lemon flesh and lemon seed. Bright apricot notes galore in here, full of apricot skin, dried apricot and underripe white peach. Finish shows a touch of apricot pit, light oak and a nice dryness. Mouthfeel is impeccable, bright and light in body without being overly carbonated. This is an amazing beer. One of the best sours I have ever had.

Been sitting on this bottle for the last week and since it is indeed a fruited sour, sooner rather than later is definitely key. 
As soon as I cracked this bad boy open, I immediately got hit with big sour fruit notes. Lots of apricot, lactic acid and faint red wine in the aroma. It is SO balanced in terms of sweet and sour. Nothing is overpowering or underwhelming. As it warms, the fruit really comes alive. It smells like apricot/orange/lemon purée in a glass. 
The first sip explodes onto the palate. Sourness is tame yet present. It is honestly one of the most perfect combinations in a beer I have ever experienced. Sourness gets you on the sides of the tongue, but then the sweetness helps to balance it out. After a couple sips, the finish is where the Pinot Noir barrel comes into play. Tannic pull from the grapes and the dryness from the oak really help to level out the other sour factors of the beer. Finish honestly last forever.
Mouthfeel is on point. A little creamy with great dryness and a long finish. Actually feels like I took a sip of Pinot Noir in terms of how dry my mouth and throat are. 
Yes, I gave this beer the elusive 5 because I thought that for what it is (a soured, fruited, wine barrel-aged Saison) it did what it was supposed to flawlessly. It skyrocketed immediately to my top 10 favorite beers of all time and is worthy of the hype and what I traded for it. A truly memorable experience. 1,466 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Nov 17, 2013

Big thanks to Chris for the bottle. Poured into a Teku.
Yellow with a little orange and an inch of white froth. Scattered lacing clings to the glass.
Sulfurous, tart, and lactic apricots with wet leather, earth, barnyard, and blue cheese. This is really damn complex and Lambic-like. The overbearing sulfur presence diminishes the overall quality of the aroma, but there are some really impressive things going on that can't be ignored.
Brackish apricot flavor with notes of musty barnyard, hay, and wet leather. Unlike in the aroma, sulfur is not overbearing here. Robust earthy notes blend seamlessly with the lactic stone fruit flesh, pit, and tannic skin. There's a little oak as well. The acidity is citric and lactic, with only a whisper of acetic. Tart throughout, finishing with a piquant flourish.
Lower medium body with matching carbonation. Dry, sticky mouthfeel. 
A very good beer with a bit too much sulfur in the nose. Hopefully they get that figured out (it's been present in some of their others beers) as it is detracting. Who needs spontaneous fermentation when you can inoculate with a house strain of this quality? 1,149 charactersHopHead84, Sep 09, 2013

A - White foam quickly settles to nothing. Looks like apricot juice with its murky medium orange body.
S - Aroma is heavy on the apricot, with light touches of oak and one of the dirtier brett strains. A bit of funk and a slight medicinal twang inhabit the periphery, but this is all about the fruit.
T - Taste is actually an improvement, as some of the dirtier brett flavors have been replaced by a mild lactic sourness. Again, light oak, but not much discernible wine or spirit flavor. Perhaps a tad lacking in depth, but what's there is delicious.
M - Medium body, with a tannic and dry texture to it before yielding to some lingering juicy fruit stickiness on the palate. Fairly low carbonation, but still crisp and refreshing.
D - This was quite enjoyable, and perfect for a hot 4th of July. My first Sante Adairius experience that bodes well for future offerings. I'd love to have this again and see if the wild yeast develops over time. 1,011 charactersMasterSki, Aug 20, 2013

A - Pours a hazy sun kist peach color with a nice one and a half finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace on the sides of the glass.
S - Smells of juicy apricots, woody oak, mild funk, white wine, bit of lactic sourness, some must and a bit of sweet pale malt. Love the funky apricot.
T - Starts off with the ripe apricots slowly giving way to some mild musty funk, white wine, oak, yogurt and a bit of sweetness from the base malt. Finish is pretty dry, lingering long after the finish. Really awesome flavors working together make this one super easconsume.
M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, sticky fruit feel with a nice dry ending. Really awesome flavors working together make this one super easy to consume.
O - Loved this one. We drank a bunch of other Peach and Stone Fruit sours the night before and I would say this was my favorite of the bunch. I would love to get my hands on a couple bottles of this one. 1,047 charactersorangesol, Aug 12, 2013

Pours a murky sunshine/ golden barley color with absolutely no head to speak of. Tannins, feet, and allspice/Belgian yeast characteristics come together to give me a confused appearance. Very unique for sure, not sure what to make of it. Apple and yeast presence is big too. Those aromas transfer to the flavor. White grape and vinegar are prevalent with a vinous slight bitterness. Reminds me more of wine than beer, which isn't a bad thing. Feel is watery with a balanced finish. 
Good, but not sure if I'd get it again. 582 charactersPhilousa, Jul 22, 2013

Batch 3: From bottle at Jupiter Sour Sunday. The aroma has taken a leap forward, just tons of dried apricots. Clearly more fruit in this batch, in a good way. Flavor is tart and tannic, apricot skin galore. 494 charactersillidurit, Jul 22, 2013

4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Bottle poured into a tulip glass, 2013 release. Beer pours a hazy golden color with a finger of loose white foam that quickly dissipates. 
Nose is very funky, good amount of barn yard and wet animal hair, with some earthier notes as well. Sweet apricot and peach fruit along with some mild citrusy sourness, fruity esters, white pepper, coriander, sweet biscuit malt. Smells good.
Taking a sip, a bit of fruity sourness, stone fruit skin astringency with a bit of unripe fruit sourness, before the brett funk and saison flavors blend in mid palate. Nice bit of sweet apricot flavor as well. Some lingering fruity flavors and funk on the tongue.
Light body and very refreshing. Very tasty beer for the warmer weather. 719 charactersnataku00, Jul 04, 2013

Label says West Ashley batch 2, Barrel aged saison with apricots. ABV, 7.3%
1 out of not many
A- Pours a hazy straw/yellowish/orange. Not much head or lacing around the glass
S- Apricots and a bit of lactic sourness. Not picking up on any barrel.
T- Similar to nose with the apricot showing up first and dominate followed by a nice lactic sourness, but not overly so. A touch of lingering graininess on the end. It has good balance and is very drinkable. Not a lot of complexity, but very good fruit flavor and is a pleasure to drink.
M- Pretty light on carbonation, but it doesnt hurt here. Tart for a saison. Although the label also says 16e, which is the belgian specialty category for BJCP rating guidelines.
O- Very nice, and a pretty cool bottle to drink. Thanks again to Kevin for the surprise! More of this would definitely not suck. 909 charactersstx00lax, Mar 12, 2013
