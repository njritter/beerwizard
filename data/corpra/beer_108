Hill beers have unrivaled mouthfeel and elegance, and this is just overdone. Intended I'm sure, given that it's 10%, but I'd take most of the Hill single and double IPAs over Ephraim. 309 charactersMojua, Apr 23, 2016

4.03/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 750 growler into a snifter. Thanks Rich for hooking me up with this.
Pours an amber slightly hazy body with a big frothy white head that reduces to leave heaving lacing and retention.
Aromas are floral, resinous, light citrus, dank, piney. Taste is very floral, herbal, grassy, finishes dry. Medium body with medium carbonation.
Glad I got to try it. Delicious DIPA from HF. 391 charactersgcamparone, Mar 28, 2016

S: Clean, grapefruit and some caramel malt. A bit of butter which is fine for the style.
T: Better here. Clean grapefruit citrus, ever so slight bubblegum. Light malt.
F: Great, this really hides the abv as there's no alcohol to speak of. Medium light and fine carb.
O: Great beer, but it's very west coast, which I'm just not a big fan of anymore. But for that style, it's great. 454 characterscultclassic89, Mar 26, 2016

Pours bRight, nearly lemon yellow and slightly hazy with a solid 2 fingers of dense head.  Nose is lemongrass combined with grapefruit and a hint of bubblegum sweetness.  The taste presented the sweet fruitiness apparent on the nose but was beautifully balanced by resinous hop bitterness.  This is definitely one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of tasting. 452 charactersmschantz, Mar 08, 2016

Hoppy, piney and floral aroma; taste of orange rind, mandarin orange, mango, apricot, grapefruit, tobacco and green tea. Outstanding citrus and bitter profile with a soft mouthfeel, but it's not a balanced beer - it's a big time hop-forward DIPA that comes on strong and doesn't let up. With a 10% ABV I'm not sure what else you could expect. Prepare your face. They've employed magic to make such a huge beer so palatable. 484 charactersManapuaMan, Mar 04, 2016

The appearance is pretty much perfect; bright auburn, perfect carbonation, sticky lacing. Pine resin and grapefruit dominate the taste and aroma. Maybe some tangelo and sweeter citrus. Though far from my favorite HF hoppy beer, it's ne of the best triple IPAs I've had. My heart still belongs to Notorious though. 392 charactersKurmaraja, Feb 29, 2016

The aroma is dank, sweet orange peel, biscuity malt, marmalade sweetness, sticky resin, pine, dried herbs.
The beer continues with an underlying theme of dank resin, onto bitter pine and herbs on the finish. It is covered with biscuity sweetness up front, bitter grapefruit peel in marmalade. 
Ephraim is a beer like no other Hill Farmstead I've encountered. Reminders of Enjoy By, Double Jack, and Hopslam come to mind, but still, the beer offers a level of drinkability and gentle qualities unlike those. 554 charactersdar482, Feb 28, 2016

4/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The hallmark of HF beers is restraint, sophistication and a flawless execution. Ephraim is a bit peculiar by this standard. It is a bit too boozy, bitter and big. Distinctly lacking in those great tropical fruit/floral notes that the best HF hoppy beers have. I suspect another reason this is slightly disappointing is that the IPA game has consistently upped the bar since Ephraim stepped on the scene. Not a bad beer, but also not up to the considerable hype either. 468 charactersjjdc, Feb 25, 2016

Taste is hugely big and bitter.  Spicy, dry and intense.  This is a real hop bomb.  At least... there isn't much else you can taste through all the IBUs.  Leaves your mouth feeling dry and sort of wrecking the palate.  It's not that this beer is bad -- it's not.  It's just SO hop forward that it'll likely only appeal to hop heads looking to be blown away.  Fine for an IPA drinker, but not especially impressive. 524 charactersanteatr23, Feb 22, 2016

The taste is an earthy hops with good malt background.  A very smooth yet hearty feel.  No double galaxy, but still a to notch beer. 197 charactersmrn1ceguy, Feb 20, 2016

S: Mango, oranges, tangerines and a multitude of tropical fruits on the nose that is met by a distinct piney dankness
T: Sweet crackery malt and citrus is evident upfront and immediately beset by strong pine and hops; the finish is sweet and dry
F: Thin to medium body with moderate carbonation
O: I can appreciate the musings of a few of the more recent reviews of this beer about how Ephraim perhaps embodies the bitter and less juicy IPAs en vogue a few years ago, but to me that is what I love about this beer. If I think back, it is the overloaded hoppy beers like this that drew me to the IPA style initially and in a sense drinking this beer takes me back a few years to an earlier time before juice bombs were all the rage. Of course this wasn't Shaun Hill's intention, but in the sense that some of his beers are a tribute to older family members, to me, Ephraim represents a best of breed from the 'old guard' of top IPAs from a few years ago. Overall this is an excellent beer and embodies the zeitgeist of an earlier era of craft beers - I'm glad to see it back and am privileged to have been able to enjoy it. 1,246 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 19, 2016

4.03/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a translucent gold with soapy white head. Some sweetness in the aroma. There is a lot of sweet malt up front. Like a fruit snack base sweetness. The piney hop finish arrives on the end, providing some nice complexity. The mouthfeel is thin though, which kind of takes away from that for me. Overall, this is a beer I would have killed for 3-4 years ago. Now, it's just a good imperial IPA. 395 charactersSheppard, Feb 18, 2016

Very boozy on the front, followed by a harsh bitterness, then a mild sweetness on the finish. 
This does not resemble a Hill Farmstead IPA at all. Not terribly well balanced. Overall, a good beer but not a great one. 361 charactersrodmanfor3, Feb 16, 2016

But this one definitely lived up to the hype! What stood out to me is the perfect balance between the pine and citrus hop characteristics and the way the ABV is hidden so well. This is up there with Triple Sunshine among the best DIPA's I've ever had and certainly the best TIPA I've ever had, if you want to consider it in that category. Worth seeking out for sure! 472 charactersjhawkvol, Feb 13, 2016

So much tropical and citrus fruit, they are just amazing how starbursting they are.  Pineapple, mango, apricot, they all jump at the nose and tongue.   Giant bitter beer but it isn't just that, it has a shitload of hop flavor and a really dry and clean mouthfeel that hides the alcohol and massivity of the innocent enough looking beer.  
One of the best beers in the world bar none. 586 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 25, 2015

A- Pours a clear, bright pale straw yellow with lots of tiny bubbles visible. A bright white head that is about 2.5 fingers in height retains well and leaves excellent lacing.
S- The aroma is bursting with hops! Sweet passion fruit, guava, star fruit, pineapple, kiwi, nectarine, onion grass, and sticky resinous pine. There's a solid backbone of pilsner, caramel, and some cracker-like malts. Smells wonderfully juicy and sweet, but with a little grapefruit zest bitterness to it. Incredible!
T- Just like the aroma this explodes with flavor! The flavor is almost like a blend of tropical fruit juice concentrates. The passion fruit and guava really are in the forefront with other fruits present, especially the nectarine. Some mango not present in the noes makes an appearance. The sweet caramel malt is very present, and just on the edge of being cloying. The pine is there, but subdued. The alcohol is definitely there, but not too much so.
M- The mouth feel is a bit thick, chewy, and sticky. Decent carbonation, but a bit thicker than I like, but still good.
O- This is a freaking awesome Imperial IPA! My only gripes are a bit too much sweetness and a bit too thick, but it's still an incredibly well crafted beer! 1,260 charactersSadMachine, Jun 24, 2014

A-Beautiful hazy pale yellow.
S-A lot of citrus, but the other fruity smells are very present.
T-Strong pine that perfectly blends in the complex citrus and fruits.
M-Medium bodied, the drinkability is amazing. Can't figure out how they combine the high abv with all the complex elements going on and still create such a smooth beer.
O-Overall this won the day on the IPA side for me along with the society and solitude at the HF Anniversary. Just a really great beer that they make up in Greensboro, can't wait till the next time I can get my hands on some! 626 charactersTmyhre802, May 29, 2014

4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5750 mL growler courtesy of DrewGingras. From notes on 25 April 2014.
Served at 38C into a HF wine glass.
A: Pale yellow, hazy body with a thick creamy 1 1/2 " head that lasts forever leaving heavy lacing. Swirling the glass gently rebuilds the head immediately. Slightly cloudy as all HF IPAs tend to be. Fine carbonation with no evidence of suspended material.
S: Huge citrus and piney esters on the nose. Slight hits of malt if you really serch, but clearly a massively hop forward beer. Wile the hops dominate, they are not dank or oily.
T: Pine and grapefruit. Juicy, yet sweet. You wouldn't think so, but this is finely balanced. Each sip entices the next. While hops dominate, they don't build or make the beer undrinkable or overly bitter. Malt is present but subdued. It's a backbone that complements the hops.
M: Surprisingly lightand properly carbonated, this beer is clean, not slick. You could drink the growler without pause. Slight, but pleasant hoppy aftertaste.
O: A lovely expression of the style. This is reminiscent of west coast style, but with a distinctly east coast, HF style. More, please? 1,119 charactersF2brewers, May 24, 2014

A: Huge pine, apricot, peach, and citrus hop notes that meld with the fruity esters from the yeast. Malt is very neutral, just a clean, faint breadiness.
T/M: Firm bitterness upfront that is met with intense piney and stonefruit hop flavors. Middle of the mouth opens up for more hop complexity of peach and citrus that is reinforced with the fruity yeast esters. The body consists of a medium bodied mouthfeel and a bone dry-finish.
Overall, this may be the best DIPA I have ever had. The flavors are extremely intense, and the balance is perfect. This one is right there with abner, maybe even better in my opinion. Shaun Hill is making some of the best hoppy beers I have ever tasted. 773 charactersSiriusfisherman, May 11, 2014

S- Grapefruit, pineapple and Mango. Some sweet notes.
T-Follows the nose with some light herbal notes and Etoh; though well hidden for the 10 abv. 
M-Like all HF beers, rather drinkable and smooth.

a: Cloudy orange with an inch tall white head which receded to dense patchy surface foam and patterned lacing.
s: Intense citrus and pine.
t: Strong orange/grapefruit citrus and pine resin hop flavor over a solid medium malt base. Bitterness is considerable but only slight bitterness lingers on the tongue. Minor throat burn for a 10.5% ABV.
m; Medium with fine body. 
o: A superior DIPA. High ABV is skillfully dealt with. Wonderful sipper with tremendous substance. 578 charactersscotorum, Apr 28, 2014

Orange yellow in color, nice sticky lace retention. Aroma is a dank, grassy lemon with a juicy grapefruit following. Taste follows the nose except you get so much orange, lemons, limes, a tiny amount of pine and malt finish it off, awesome. Mouthfeel is exceptional as always with a HF brew. Medium body, low carbonation, soft and incredibly smooth. 
This is truly world class. Not perfect but incredibly close. So well rounded in terms of it truly being citrus forward with a very light pine/malt base. One of my absolute favorite beers of all time. 569 charactersrjp217, Apr 26, 2014

A: Golden yellow, fizzy white head

T: A lot of the same as the nose. Citrus fruits, lemon, grapefruit, grass. This tastes like a 6-7% beer in my opinion, not a 10.5% one. I'm pretty blown away by the lightness of this beer and how it also contains such a huge and unique yet not overbearing hop punch.
M: So light and easy to drink

Location: Hill Farmstead
Glassware: Red Wine Glass
Appearance: A neatly clear amber that looks like a perfect carbonated apple juice. Pours with a thumb size white head that evaporates quickly with no cascading. 
Aromatics: It starts with a Pine bomb. The hops also impart the fruit flavor, a mix between mango and peaches. A nice wheaty grassy smell. 
Flavor: The pine again hits first but now the resin is totally present. White peaches and mango. Some sugar in there that I'm having trouble placing adds to the sweetness. 
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is smooth with a good deal of the resin on the tongue. A nice carbonation.
Notes: Had on tap at HF and in a 750ml growler. Bottled 4/9/14 and suggested drink by date is 4/17/14. 742 charactersKornWallace, Apr 16, 2014

4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Doug generously bought this growler to share with me and Shaun #1 yesterday, 6/3/2013. Poured into a snifter.
Aroma: Fantastic. Smells like straight up citrus. Very explosive nose that's even more so than Pliny. There's tropical fruit and a hint of pine. Yet its all put together extremely well and explosive to boot.
Colour: Hazy gold body that pours with a nice 1cm white head that dissipates quickly into a thin film and collar. Some lacing, but not a ton. It looks very appetizing and refreshing.
Flavour: Follows the nose- its a well-done, complex combination of hops and malt. Lots of citrus, some tropical fruit, a bit of grassiness and a good bite of pine on the back end. Its also got a nice sweet malt backbone- a bit of candied sugar and honey. Incredibly pleasing to drink, and I had no idea it was 10.5% ABV at any point.
Mouthfeel: A nice surprisingly full bodied beer that definitely has substance more so than a lot of other DIPAs. Its well-carbonated and comes with a fizzly dry finish. Aftertaste is not too bitter which I really appreciated, but it does have a good bit of pine and grassiness to it.
Overall: Excellent DIPA, one of the best I've ever had. I would have been able to drink the whole bottle myself in a flash if I wanted to. And let me tell you, I wanted to. To me, it's much more on the Pliny end of the spectrum vs the Abrasive end, but it's just as flavourful if not more so than Pliny is with the same bit of quaffability it has. I'm very impressed and thanks to Doug for sharing this gem.
Re-review: Thanks to a very generous VT trader, I was able to repay Doug the favour of bringing a growler of Ephraim to a tasting, almost a year later. Thanks! Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass today, 4/13/2014. Basically, this is what I remember this beer as. It's a classic DIPA, compared to Abner, which I really realize is appropriately labeled as more of a double pale ale. Smells so complex, with a lot of citrus, pine and floral notes, and the palate is appropriately more so. It's such a complex, bitter DIPA with a great creamy mouthfeel that really satisfies any aspect of a DIPA that you could look for. Having had this on a fresh palate, this is up there with Double Sunshine for the most complex, drinkable and enjoyable DIPA that I've ever had. That includes Heady, Pliny, Kern Citra, King Sue, etc. that I've been able to try over the past year, and trust me, that's a lot of fantastic DIPAs. Ephraim and Double Sunshine is 1a and 1b at this point for me, and while I prefer Double Sunshine to this, you can't go wrong with this as far as double IPAs go. 2,611 charactersStevedore, Apr 14, 2014

Tropical fruit, honey dew melon. The taste is more bitter than the smell. Pine and citrus with a small alcohol burn. Lemon comes through well. It's a pretty easy drinker for 9%. Medium mouthfeel, smooth as creamy. Impressive for a high alcohol DIPA. 345 charactersMikeypnh, Apr 10, 2014

I'd say Ephraim is a lot more bitter, a little less sweet and didn't have as good as a smell as HT. Not saying I prefer one to the other, it's just a different amazing beer drinking experience. 297 charactersDavepoolesque, Apr 10, 2014

The nose is pungent, light clean grain, dusty, strong tropical fruits, mango and grapefruit behind. Taste also has nice balance with huge hop punch. The grain is up front, clean and lightly dusty. Hops surround with a creamy dough and more tropical fruit. Plenty of mango and fuzzy peach with a grapefruit hit in back and crisp bitterness with little lingering effect. Body is light, a touch creamy mid palate, softer carbonation in the finish. 529 characterscpetrone84, Feb 02, 2014

A large white frothy head sat upon a light amber bodied DIPA.
First aromas were breathtaking. Citrusy lemon and sweet mango. 
First taste was jaw dropping. Citrusy, and dry and full of zing. Delicious.
Mouthfeel was fantastic for a late spring warm day, crisp and refreshing.
This beer is a touch alcohol forward and mixed with Shaun's citrusy profile made for a staggeringly good beer. 447 charactersBoldRulerVT, Nov 25, 2013

Lightly hazed pale orange colour, ring of white headwith a bit of lace here as well. The nose ihas a huge citrus to it, lots of tropical fruit, tangerine, orange, a bit of grapefruit with a bit of sugary malts as well, fantastic hop aroma here. Taste is equally amazing lots of juicy hops and sweet malt up front, followed by loads of citrus flavours, grapefruit and orange, good bitterness throughout, hoppy aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, fairly full bodied. Outstanding stuff, incerdibly drinkable and just an impressive display of hops here. 623 characterspeensteen, Jul 29, 2013

4.99/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Last of my Hill Farmstead from my trip a few weeks back. 750 ml bottle style growler poured in to my Hill Farmstead stemware. 
A - Pours a murky golden orange color, nice carb with a two finger effervescent head. Delicate lacing clings to the glass as I drink. Even though the beer is unfiltered, it is still a nice looking beer. 
S - Sweet tropical fruits, blends of citrus fruits, some earthy notes peak through. Candied sugar and all the right notes, a nose that beckons you in to the first taste. Legit and all too intoxicating. 
T - Sweet up front, with a pungent hop note. Sweet tropical fruits in melody with citrus-y hops. MIght be a tad sweeter than some would like in a DIPA, but the hops are blended so well in this one, it is punchy without being over bitter. A taste like none other, I can recollect only a few beers where I was like 'oh, ok' when I first tasted. 
M - Despite being sweet up front, the balance in hop pungency makes this beer incredibly balanced. The sweetness is no factor in the drink-ability of the beer. Not much more can be said, this is a very easy to drink beer. 
O - This beer exhibits all the best qualities of an easy to drink DIPA. It is tropical punch, sweet but balanced and smooth as can be. One of my all time favorites; I pull no punches here. 1,294 charactersnesarebad, Jun 23, 2013

A: Pours a straw/pale color with two fingers of cloud-like, wispy white head. Very good retention but chaotic, thin lacing.
S: Liquid caramel, candied citrus (tangerine), white grape, grass, bready character. Nice complexity on the nose. 
T: Bread and biscuit are the most prominent, with undertones of grapefruit peel, tangerine, a little white grape, finishing with a mild to moderate bitterness which is offset slightly by lingering sugar and citrus.
M: Medium body, soft texture, with medium, somewhat sharp carbonation. No alcohol is evident; in fact, this drinks like a pale ale.
O: A solid and well constructed--though unexceptional--pale ale. (Wait, wut. This is a DIPA?) Drinkability is average: it kind of grates on me after half a pint partly due to the bitterness. Sigh, there are so many better options that are much more readily available. 885 characterspmarlowe, Jun 15, 2013

A: Beautiful golden-orange with a foamy white head. Sediment mars the overall beauty, but it still looks quite nice. 
N: Wonderfully balanced. Pine, earth, mango, pineapple. Deep and rounded. Some grass and a little bit of caramel around the edges. 
T: Quite sweet at the front with a moderate bitterness. Showcases the hops very well. Both stinging and balanced. Big kudos here, though it’s just a tad sweet for me. 
M: Very good mouthfeel. Carbonated nicely with a slight dryness and a round, heavy mouthfeel. 
O: A top tier beer that might get a few more points from me with a touch more dryness and a little less malt. Still, well done. Would have time and time again. 716 charactersSarlacc83, Jun 10, 2013

Pours a hazy light apricot with a sheet of light white foam. Smell is juicy. Some pear, some tangerine, some melons and pineappel, and hints of resin, but mostly sweet juicy hops. This is an approach to hops and grain I've not really experienced before, this is really innovative - this does not really smell like an IPA/IIPA. More like a sweet biscuit with some preserves on it. Flavor follows suit, really unassuming for the style. Not overly syrupy sweet, like some IIPAs, but slightly sweet with lots more juicy fruit, biscuity malt and now some bitterness and a little more hop character as it warms. Full bodied with sharp carb and a semi dry finish. This is a really fine brew, I'm not sure I would go nuts for it, and would likely prefer a few cans of Heady Topper over this, or several others as well. i might argue the beer is a little too heavy on the Dextrose, like Hop Henge in the last couple years. 970 charactersharrymel, Jun 08, 2013

Appearance: Pours a hazy orange/light amber and leaves behind a couple fingers of light, very fluffy head behind. A beautiful pour.
Smell: Citrus, grapefruit, earthy, grassy tones. Definitely the most citrus I've ever smelt from an IPA.
Taste: Citrus! Light grassy notes, mango, pineapple, peaches. Extremely balanced and delicious. As tasty as the hops are they aren't overwhelming - this beer has a great malt backbone. Finishes with grapefruit. Supremely smooth - no alcohol flavor to it at all - I don't know where the 9+% ABV is. Mind-blowing. I've never tasted a beer like this.
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation, light to medium body. Amazingly smooth and a great juicy mouth-feel to it.
Overall: I am pretty blown away by this beer. It is hands down, the best tasting IPA I've ever had. The fruity, citrus notes from the hops just explode in my mouth and yet it is so smooth, I feel like I could drink a gallon of this stuff and still want more. Amazing. 1,045 charactersResuin, May 31, 2013

4.9/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy peach hue with a generous two finger soapy white head, crazy lacing. This is an unfiltered concoction, so there is some sediment present that only adds to the appearance.
The nose is prominent: completely hop forward with only a trace of malt: my kind on IIPA.
Mango,pineapple,and nectarine are assaulting your nostrils....beautiful. The dry hopping really steps up the intensity level on the aroma, just amazing.
Flavors are pretty close to the strong aroma: intense and tropical, piney, and slightly warming. The 10.5% abv is nicely hidden though not completely undetectable.
The mango-pineapple blast is most juicy and inviting, the bitter grapefruit presence plays out in the finish, which is dry and desirable.
Mouthfeel is medium, dry satisfying finish.This 3 week old swing top growler maintained the excellent carbonation in an impressive manner. Intense flavors coat the palate like roofing tar leaving a delightful bitterness on the back of the palate.
Overall, easy to see why Hill Farmstead only fills 750 ml growlers and limits you to four at their Greensboro Bend retail store. Ephraim is amazing, and extremely high on the recommendation list, seek this one out for sure. I'm gonna get four more of these and trade none of them this time! Understandable why traders from everywhere want this stuff, but the incredible quality and a formidable drive to acquire it make it a private stock item of the highest order: HFS has built their reputation on excellence, and just about everything on the planet pales in comparison (Lawson's Double Sunshine not withstanding). 1,598 charactersHendry, May 30, 2013

A: Pours a hazy golden color with a nice white fluffy head on top. Great head retention and lacing. 
S: Great aroma of citrus and tropical fruit. Grapefruit, lemon, orange, orange rind, and a bit of mango. A little bit of grainy malt, but the aroma from the hops in this one dominate. 
T: Similar to the aroma, lots of grapefruit and pineapple mixed with orange rind and zest. Some nice bitter pine comes in afterwards giving it a slight bitterness 
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinks easy and smooth for its abv. 
O: Fantastic DIPA, really bright flavors. Not my favorite DIPA of all time, but definitely up there. 683 charactersmdaschaf, May 26, 2013

Ephraim pours a relatively clear bright yellow gold in color with a one finger, soapy white head. The nose is very fresh and aromatic with plenty of tangerine and pineapple. Right off the bat it reminds me of Dreadnaught with just a touch more malty sweetness. The flavors are very bright and clean tangerine, pineapple, and grassy hop character with a moderate level of pale malt sweetness and a touch of alcohol. The best part of all of this is how well rounded the flavors are. It drinks pretty light in body and for the style isnt bitter at all, increasing drinkability. Overall this is an excellent beer worthy of high praise. To this Midwesterner, Ephraim is a slightly sweeter, fruiter Dreadnaught. 775 charactersaasher, May 25, 2013

Appearance - Slightly hazy amber colour with a large size frothy white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation and there is some good lacing. The head lasted for over 5 minutes before it was gone and there are some floaties.
Smell - Malts, caramel, hops, grapefruit, lemons, tangerines
Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and the taste is made up of caramel and malts mixed with lots of hops. It also has apricots, pineapples, lemons, grapefruits, tangerines and a little bit of a candied fruit sugary sweetness. It ends with a pungent citrusy bitter hop aftertaste.
Overall - It reminded me of a sweeter Heady Topper. Definitely one of the better beers I've had to date. I'd like a touch less sweetness but it is an imperial IPA afterall I guess. Happy I had the chance to try this, truly world class. 885 charactersspinrsx, May 21, 2013

Bright golden straw color. Four finger rocky pillow of white sits atop. This dies down to a one finger width that isn't going anywhere. Thick, sticky patches of lace hang onto the glass after every sip.
Big tropical notes of mango and peach. Some grapefruit and rind mix in with spicy and grassy notes. Can't wait to get a drink.
Follows the nose extremely well. Juicy fruits flow across the tongue. Finishes just slightly resinous with a little bite of spice. Simply delicious. This 750 doesn't stand a chance. Full bodied and prickly. Not overpowering at all, with barely any lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is perfect!
I was completely ready to be underwhelmed by the hype of my first HF. That didn't happen. Can't wait to try some other offerings. 787 charactersbigaltemple, May 21, 2013

Spend the weekend up in Greensboro at a friend's camp and naturally we had to brave a Saturday trip to Hill since it is only five minutes away. We walked up at Noon on a Saturday and were able to walk directly up to the counter with no wait and no line! The guy said it was luck at first try haha!
Look - Pours a slightly hazy honey golden with a luxurious soapy head that dissipates quickly. Fresh, sticky lacing. Minimal carbonation.
Smell - Yeasty and bready sweet honey malts with a rich hop overlay. Pine and resiny hops. Also some spices in the nose. Unique smell and very inviting!
Taste - Rich and thick, a full flavored citrus and pine hops wave of complicated flavor that is one of those ones that transforms as the brew warms. Nice bitter finish.
Mouthfeel - Sticky and hop bitter. Drinkable but formidable. Somewhat boozy but at 9% it is not a surprise at all. Warming to the face and neck but quite pleasant.
Overall - Hill Farmstead continues to delight. This deceptive "golden delicious" kicks some serious ass. This one is my favorite of their offerings. 1,125 charactersJMScowcroft, May 19, 2013

S - Huge citrusy/honey fruit with lots of pine and resin Very very similar to heady in its sweet spot of 2-3 weeks out from being canned. 
T - Piney and big flavor, but without being super syrupy and malty. The malt is delicate and really just supports the hopping, which is perfect for a Diipa
M - Again, not thick but is very drinkable. I could drink a lot of these because they go down easy.
O - I have 2 more 750s to try this week to get a better grasp. This is very very good and on par if not surpassing heady. I found that it creeps up on you 20 mins or so after you finish drinking it...I dont experience this with most beers it usually takes less time.

A~ hazy golden, glowing copper, nice white head, a little lacing and a good amount of sediment! mmm...! the pieces!
S~ lots of citrus, grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange, tiny bit of mango. lots of piney earthyness from the hops, and a tad hint of booze on the finish.
T~ extremely complex! with every sip something different comes out, but still very well balanced! follows the nose with all the citrus, plus a ton more pine notes, and different "funk" with every sip. a little white grape funk up in there. it kind of has an Abner thing going on without the saison aspects and minus the slightly boozy smell that you get the whole time as you go for it but its ohh so smooth on the palet.
M~ super nice carbonation, not as dry as i would aspect from all the hops. very refreshing, i could sip on this all day and be very messed up haha and once again sooo smoooth.
O~ yup! amazing! this will some how be added to my top 5 hoppy brews... yeah i don't know how thats gonna happen haha better make it a top 10 or 20 =] but i seriously love it. definitely try it out if you have the chance, highly recommended for sure. its all about the hop funk! 1,212 charactersSkrip, May 16, 2013

A - Poured a dark orange colour and cloudy. Two finger pillowy and thick head of an off white persuasion. Great thick rings of lace and a half finger of retention.
S - Similar to other HF pales and IPAs. Tons of citrus and passionfruit. Melon is a nice addition. Grapefruit and mango too. There is a distinct element I can't pin down that I really enjoyed. Sweet fruits, mango, canteloupe, some alcohol. Gorgeous.
T - Much of the same with more grapefruit. Grapefruit pith and pineapple. Less sweet fruit. Some orange. Bit rougher than the aroma leads on. More darker, sweet tropical fruits, and more grapefruit-esque citrus. Less bright citrus in the flavour. Some good maltiness is there. A little alcohol is present. Complex.
M - Gripping bitterness, fairly strong carbonation, medium to full body that seems a bit oily. 
O/D - Flavour is weaker than the aroma. But seriously, this is quality. Complex, tasty, and fairly balanced for what it is. Malt shows, but doesn't play too big a role. Well done and easy to drink for what it is. 1,113 charactersbylerteck, May 08, 2013

Only downside (?) is the abv. Tough to drink more than a couple and make it through the night. The aroma is spectacular, and I truly think the only worthy alternative in the 10%+ IPA arena is PTY, which is similarly spectacular. Outrageously hoppy, but balanced as much as it can be with a malt backbone. Citrus, grapefruit and grassy hops are all over the aroma and flavor. A complex brew for sure, sort of an overhopped barleywine, but a class act in the IPA space. If you find it on tap or get a growler of it, do not succumb to letting it be your first beer of the night or you will be doomed. Finish with it when it cannot wreck your palate for whatever comes next. 781 characterschuckd123, Mar 06, 2013

Growler filled at the brewery two days ago. I've had this beer multiple times from multiple batches but this is the first time writing a full review.
A- Pours a nice glowing yellowish orange with some light translucency and a light haze. About a finger's worth of white foamy head forms that has decent retention leaving spotty lacing as it recedes. Nice consistent carbonation.
S- Oranges, orange peels, grapefruit, balanced malts, a little bit of booze. Nice balance but booze comes through a bit and slightly too zesty, but other then that perfect.
T- Nice juicy oranges, hint of grapefruit, some orange peel, restrained bitterness, very little booze presence, nice lingering orange juice presence on the finish. Awesome balance, nice juiciness, hardly any alcohol presence for the abv.
M- Medium bodied, juicy, extremely drinkable especially when considering abv, nice carbonation level, exactly how I like my IPAs.
O- This is one of my favorite HF IPAs, and easily one of the best IPAs out there. The drinkability and juiciness of this is incredible considering the abv on it, my only complaint is that I wish it was made more often. If you're a hop-head this is definitely one worth seeking out. 1,278 charactersjaasen64, Feb 23, 2013

Score: 99
Exactly one week old 750 ml growler served in a Perennial snifter and enjoyed on 05/21/13.
Appearance: Pours a hazy golden straw color with two-plus fingers of white head that settle to a thin layer atop the glass. A layer of lacing coats the side of the glass and lingers forever. Excellent appearance for the style. My second glass (not pictured) was laden with floaties, however, which is why the appearance only gets a four out of five. 4/5
Smell: Dank, resinously piney hops and grapefruit smack you upfront. Pine sap, peach, mango, lemon, pineapple, caramel and a little bit of what can only be described as "fresh potting soil" (in a good way). Some spice and "dirty hops" too. This beer smells like a raw and hoppy tropical citrus bomb that is aggressively rough around the edges -- I could smell this beer all day. 5/5
Taste: Super bitter and juicy tropical citrus and piney hops. The bitter pine flavor really lingers on the palate. A lovely medley of grapefruit, pineapple juice, lemon zest, bitter orange rind and tangerine soak the palate. A little spicy caramel malt kick of flavor towards the finish that blends nicely with the piney bitterness. I absolutely love the aggressive hoppiness of this brew! 5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied with spot on carbonation to both give the hops life and let the bitterness linger on the tongue. Super oily, juicy and mouthwatering. If you let this elixir sit on the tongue for a few seconds, the bitter factor really kicks in. 5/5
Overall: A near perfect hoppy beer, which perfectly hit the spot after a long day of work on a perfect spring afternoon. This is much better than I recall it being back when I first had it at Darkness Day this year. Ephraim has all the juiciness and aggressively bitter hoppiness one desires in an IPA (er, imperial pale ale). Easily one of my top 10, possibly even top 5, pale ale/IPA consumed to date. If you have not had a chance to try this yet, I highly recommend you seek out a growler pour while it is still in season and available at the brewery!
Cost: $10 for a 750 ml growler (no 2L fills available this time around). 2,357 charactersjegross2, Feb 08, 2013

4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a vibrant orange glow, slightly over one inch of head on it. Nose just erupts with the juiciest aromas of tropical and citrus fruits this side of Pliny, maybe even moreso. Its magnificent and owes nothing to nobody. Sliding in with the varied fruits are plenty of pine and soft lemon. Pineapple, pine, apricot, mango, you name it, its there. Yum. 
Everything that shows up in the aroma takes on a respectful assault on the palate, again, waves of tropical fruit, citrus fruit and pine envelope the tongue. There's tons of bitterness, but it comes off so smooth, and for being ten and a half percent abv, there sure is no sign on of it, this beer really tastes phenomenal and drinks effortlessly, you don't have to feel like you're getting your big boy drinking jeans on, this one just rocks so easily. The malt is so much a distant memory, but somehow manages to carry the gigantic double dry hopped triple ipa. Really one of the natural wonders of the world I says. Finishes very dry, while keeping the fruitiness and green vegetal hop mouthfeel persistently dominating the mouth. The hops are just so herbal, so tasty per bitterness unit. The best hops in massive quantity, making some great teamwork and love. 
What more could a guy want? An ipa that is just bursting with hop flavors reeking of tangerine, orange, pine, lemon, melon, mint, apricot, pineapple, green apple, mango, papaya, you could go on forever. 
This is what triple ipas are all about. There's really only one other in its class. 1,510 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Dec 24, 2012

A. It has a nice deep straw to red color, with a big white head and a good deal of lacing.
S. It has a fruity, hop scent. 
T. As the scent would indicate, this is a nice fruity hop taste. A good bitter bite, with some tangy fruit. 
M. It has a nice carbonated, bitter bite.

Hazy, amber color. Duh. Looks like any and every Hill Farmstead hoppy beer and I am pleased just by the looks! Grainy and piney aroma.

A- Pours a slightly hazy orange with a thin head that leaves minimal lacing.
S- Tropical fruit upfront with mango, passion fruit and pineapple followed by citrus zest, floral notes, fresh herbs, peppery spice, caramel malt, pine and a touch of heat.
T- An abundant amount of tropical and citrus fruit mixed with pine needles, peppery spice, herbs, floral hops, caramel malt and some heat.
M- Low carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel and a slightly boozy finish. 
O- This is one big DIPA. Plenty of dank tropical and citrus hops similar to other HF IPAS. I preferred Abner a bit more, but that doesn't really say much since both are fantastic. 745 charactersiadler, Oct 27, 2012
4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750ml growler poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass.
The beer pours a lovely hazy copper color, reminiscent of orange rinds or peach skins. There is a really nice finger of stark white head, good retention, moderate lacing with a light film on top once the head recedes. A fantastic aroma, huge citrus presence, oranges, grapefruit, light floral notes, and a great tropical fruit presence, mangos, pineapples and a touch of alcohol at the end. The flavors are almost as perfect, lovely citrus burst right away, oranges, grapefruits, light lemon zest followed by a tremendous fruit presence, passionfruit, sweet pineapple juice and faint mango. There is a backing of strong bitter earthy hops that bring out a really nice resinous presence that helps counterbalance the bright and vibrant citrus and fruit flavors. A touch of alcohol wraps up an exceptionally complex and balance flavor profile. The body is perfection, smooth, juicy, spot on dry finish, perfect for an IPA.
Verdict: Simply sensational IPA, between this and Abner, there is no clear winner, only incredible beer. My hats off to Hill Farmstead for this, it is just sublime, great complexity on the tongue, awesome dry finish, everything I want in an IPA. 1,226 characterskevanb, Oct 27, 2012

Thanks to Rudzud for this one
App- A bit lighter in the glass than Abner was. This was more yellow tinged in color. A smaller one finger head. This was still a bit hazy but less dense in the glass than Abner was. A couple dots of cling and lace. Falls quickly vs. the fluffy Abner.
Smell- A nice nose for a DIPA. Doesnt blow me away but its solid. A couple notches below Abner but yet better than 90% of other DIPAs. A small bit of creamy hops and a bit of citrus. Not sure what fruit combo this one is. More of a dense/dank aroma.
Taste- This was a good DIPA, not a great one. Better than 90-95% of whats out there. It was a nice creamy flavor with some good hoppy bitter behind it. This one on the others from HF was more dank/and dense on the zest behind it. A bit more grapefruit and peach flavors.
Mouth- A nice body similar to Abner with a bit of creamy hops and some creaminess remaining. A nice amount of bitter zest and fruits remain. Call this a solid medium body DIPA with a nice wet carbonation behind it.
Drink- Well the fearsome twosome from HF have been taken down. I liked Abner more but wont say no to this again. 1,181 charactersFosterJM, Oct 22, 2012

I've had my fair share of HF beers, but for some reason this one has eluded me for years. Now I've had it, and despite it's reputation, I must say, I'm not a huge fan. I actually think the bartender may have poured me the wrong beer, because it just didn't match the bill.
Appearance-wise, the beer was tremendous. Served in a HF stem glass, slightly hazy, bright amber color with a large, foamy, white head that retained amazingly and left blankets of lacing on the glass. Aroma of somewhat muted tropical and stone fruits, musty grass, somewhat bready; none of the intensity I'd expect from a fresh IPA though. More in line with a Belgian IPA or even moderately hoppy saison (further leading me to believe it could have been a mis-pour). Unexpected hit of funkiness up front in the taste, soft peach, citrus zest, mango, pear, bready malts, slightly bitter in the aftertaste. Hmm. Yep. This was either a fresh saison or an old Ephraim. Medium body, somewhat sticky and chewy. Overall fairly drinkable, but not quite what I expected. 1,086 charactersRifugium, Oct 13, 2012
4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5pours like all HF pale hoppy beers, hazy golden straw colored with a HUGE off-white head that sticks around forever and leaves chunks of lacing on the glass when it finally recedes.
lots of tropical fruit on the nose, with some dank hops, tons of citrus, a bit earthy with some powdered sugar hiding behind that.
Pineapple, mango, grapefruit, dank and earthy hops just fill your palate. overtake it, one could say. not bitter overly bitter, but jam packed with hop flavor. gets more dank and earthy as it warms and your palate adjusts. wonderfully balanced blend of hops to make this way too drinkable for a beer of this magnitude.
medium bodied and with a pleasant carbonation with a tropical/bitter hoppiness that lingers for a while. a long while.
the first beer from HF that "wowed" me two years ago at the Extreme Beer Fest. probably the only time I've gone up for multiples of one beer at a festival like that. just tremendously balanced, in your face, yet nuanced. genius. 984 characterssilentjay, Oct 12, 2012

A: Pours Golden orange honey, super hazy, and completely opaque.
S: THe aroma is strong of peaches or apricots and other tropical fruits. Very citrusy.
T: The taste follows the smell with lots of peaches and fruity citrus up front but then the hops take over and come through with the goodness that comes with a good Imperial pale ale. The high abv is almost unnoticeable as a caught myself drinking it a little too fast. The finish has just the right amount of hoppy bitterness for my liking,
M: THe mouth feel is smooth, oily, and very drinkable
Overall there isn't much more to say another fantastic offering from Hill Farmstead get this if you get the chance, I love Vermont Beers! 746 charactersPinknuggets, Oct 10, 2012

A- Cloudy as can be, like a murky glass of orange colored swamp juice. Creamy white head forms with a few fingers in size, decent retention. Lace forms immediately and continues down the glass nicely.
S- Big hops lead the way in the aroma. Orange and lemon zest are big along with notes of tropical fruit, pine resin and citrus juice. Slight grains and malts.
T- Hops big here too with lots of fruity things going on. Mango, huge orange juice/zest, citrus bonanza, grapefruit is big, pineapple and some peppery herbal hints. Definitely a bit of sweetness, caramel and alcohol to back those hops up.
MF- Creamy and moderately thick, oily body with a crisp carbonation. Big bitterness and some alcohol warmth.
Big hop blast with tons of nice citrus fruit notes. Really nice use of hops. 896 characterscbutova, Oct 10, 2012
4.25/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 750ml growler straight from the source provided by who else but cbutova. Enjoyed whilst running around changing a car battery.
Pours a super hazy orange, full-a floaties. Small white head retains decently.
Super citrus/orange juice up-front in the scent, lots of earthy fruitiness, a touch of alcohol. Big scent that fades a bit with time.
Taste is where it's at, huge beer. Lots of danky oranges, pine, bright juicy tropical fruit, grapefruit, with big caramel malts and breadiness there too. It is definitely on the sweeter side for an IPA but hops are huge as well.
Good full mouthfeel. High bitterness is balanced nicely by the malts, drinks pretty easy for the ABV - it feels big but there's not much alcohol heat.
I think the sweetness+alcohol could get to be a little much after time, I think as far as DIPA's go I prefer something more like Abner or Heady Topper. But this is without a doubt a crazy good beer. 937 charactersChico1985, Oct 09, 2012

A: Pours a very hazy dark mango color with a couple fingers of dense white head. Head faded into a thin film that lasted the whole beer through. Great sheets of thick lace were left down the glass. 
S: A sweet smelling hop bomb full of citrus and tropical fruits. Sweet notes of passion fruit, kiwi, mint, orange juice, mango and grapefruit peel. 
T: Follows the nose with sweet hop flavors of tropical fruits and mild citrus. A citrus rind bitterness shows up in the finish, but overall sweet juicy mango, passion fruit and fruit nectar's dominate. I get a touch of mint in the finish as well, and the aftertaste is full of the lingering citrus rind. I get a touch of peach in there as well. 
M: Thick for the style with a sweet but not cloying mouthfeel. Carbonation is fine, fluffy, and smooth. Alcohol is completely hidden, although judging by hope good I’m starting to feel, I’d say it’s in the double digits. 
O: Better than I expected, although I’m not sure why as all the hoppy beers I've had from Shaun are amazing. I would drink this on the regular if available. The only thing I can even remotely knock is the sweetness; personal preference is geared toward a dryer bitterer feel. This drinks just fine though, and the alcohol is hidden so ridiculously well.

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Grapefruit, lemon zest, pine resins... what more could you want in an IPA? Fills the glass with a nice hazy orange body and a creamy white head. Citrus fruits dominate the initial aroma before the pine notes come through. A hint of alcohol comes through as well as it warms. 
On the palate it's more bitter than some other HF IPAs I've had. Still, the citrus punch makes for an incredibly refreshing beverage. Slightly spicy as well and the 10.5% ABV is well noted after the first sip or two. 
Overall, truly a top-notch IPA as expected but not quite on the same level as Abner or Heady in my book. The slightly higher ABV is the most notable difference on my tastebuds and I guess I prefer the lower ones. 708 charactersKinsman, Oct 09, 2012

Appearance: Bright orange / yellow in color with a nice two finge, creamy thich head with good retention. A bit cloudy throughout but very nice.
Aroma: Tons of tropical fruit and pine notes upfront. The hop aromas are really big and hit hard. Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, lychee and pine notes are all present. Really nice balance of sweetness and bitterness.
Taste: Nice balance of sweet and bitterness here although there is a touch more bitterness than the aroma. Big mango and grapefruit notes countered with honey sweetness. The alcohol is really well hidden. Definitely plays a bit bigger and sweeter than other HF IPA's I have had, but it doesn't get anywhere near cloying. Bitter pine finish. Surprisingly drinkable and really refreshing.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, but the carbonation adds a crisp character. A bit creamy as well.
Overall, a top notch DIPA and certainly one of the best in this ABV range I've had. I think I prefer Abner and some other HF IPA's to this one just because of the ABV. The hop character is bright, vibrant and complex though and it drinks really easy considering. I definitely will seek this one out again. 1,334 charactersGosox8787, Oct 07, 2012

Pour: Completely hazy orange with a finger and a half of white, fluffy head. Leaves decent lacing. I love the way Hill Farmstead's unfiltered beers look, and this might just take the cake.
Smell: This beer incorporates all the amazing aspects of a DIPA. All of them. Bursts of grapefruit and orange juice up front, followed by a light lemon zest an white peppercorn. Follows with a clean resinous pine, and light caramel sweetness. I can already tell this beer is going to be big.
Taste: I'm speechless. This beer incorporates so much flavor. Follows the nose to a T, but increases the intensty on everything. Grapefruit and OJ are the overriding flavors that call the shots, with a really, really nice peppercorn spiciness. A light resin lingers around, and the caramel sweetness is pretty substantial, at least for a Hill Farmstead beer. Ephraim needs it - the hop intensity here is not to be trifled with.
Mouthfeel: So incredibly juicy, and so incredibly bitter. This is probably the first Hill Farmstead beer that I am not able to guzzle down should I please. Definitely requires time to enjoy, and that is fine by me, because I don't want the glass to end.
Overall: Wow. I honestly never thought I would get a chance to try this beer, and it did not disappoint. Easily the best "big" DIPA I've ever had, and certainly in my top 5 ever. Hopefully one day at HF, I encounter this beer again. 1,545 characterscfrances33, Oct 05, 2012

S- Lots of tropical fruit, mango/grapefruit/tangerine. There are some nice fresh hoppy scents in here as well, but it is somewhat overwhelmed by the citrus. A hint of sweet malt, and even a touch of booziness.
T- Hints of tangerine and grapefruit immediately enter my mouth. The hoppiness comes through next, with a nice balance of malt and resin. The aftertaste is a slightly dry piney hop flavor, but still with plenty of citrus.
M- Perfect for the style. Nice carbonation and the body is spot on. What more could you ask for.
O- I've been waiting 2 years to try this again, and I just happened to be headed to the brewery on the right weekend. I can't really say enough about this beer. It is up there with the best of the best. Not the dries, hoppiest IPA, but just some balanced and flavorful. If you can get your hands on this, buy as much as you can.

1 finger white frothy head with great retention. Beer is a cloudy grapefruit with patchy and stringy lace with good stick. Amazing save for the clarity.
Nose is citrus, papaya, grapefruit, cane sugar, and a creamy, sappy, hop presence. Aromatic and very enticing. 
Opens papaya, citrus, grapefruit, and hop resin. More tropical fruit in the middle and end. Finish is cane sugar with a light citrus hop presence. Sappy hop aftertaste. Like an alcoholic tropical fruit smoothie with an added hop kick. Simply amazing.
Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and smooth going down with a messy finish and a lingering aftertaste. How this could be 10.5% and this drinkable is unexplainable. 
If you're a fan of IIPAs with a big malt and citrus presence, it doesn't get any better than Ephraim. A beer that's almost perfect in every way, this offering embodies the Hill Farmstead lineup. Hands down, the best in the style in my opinion. 1,090 charactersSpeedwayJim, Oct 01, 2012

A - Pours a murky orange with a 1" white head. Turns into full lacing.

T - Follows the aroma quite a bit. Tons of floral oranges, smooth throughout, hardly any bitterness on the finish. Notes of other faint fruits, such as pineapple and mango, are evident. Smooth and easy to drink. The lingering flavor is of faint oranges.
M - Medium body. Appropriate for style.
O - One of the best DIPAs out there, with less than a handful I can think of that compare. Everything about it really comes together perfectly. The balance between the floral flavors and the orange-like citrus seem perfect. The low bitterness gives just enough bite on the tongue to be pleasant without going overboard.

Bright orange, slightly cloudy. Creamy white head and lace adorn the goblet. Grapefruit and fresh hops in the nose aren't as bold as other HF offerings, but admittedly that's a ridiculous standard.
Much more bitter flavor profile than any other HF DIPA I've tried. Intensely fruited with tons of grapefruit and bitter orange peel. Reminds me of biting too close to the rhind of an orange. Boozy, very hoppy.

A- Ephraim pours a gorgeous hazy orange with a flare of an off white head that consistently tags the edges of the glass as it retreats. Detailed carbonation consistantlty lingers towards the top as the brew glows
S- Ridicuously ripened grapefruit that is running parallel with a dank resionious piney hop scent. The brew literally explodes with fresh citric flavor from an army's length away... And makes my mouth water. Literally heightens the other senses with the fresh tropical flavors
T- Smooth delivery of pineapple, mango, and papaya flavors that could quite possibly be enrobed in a piney hop tortilla! Flavor is exuberant and as fresh as it gets for a DIPA. While I need to mention that there is not even an alcohol presence, I can't avoid mentioning the finish of bitter piney resin that makes this fantastic! 
M- again smooth, yet present with cactus like prickles of carbonation that stings the tongue with hop flavor. Carbonation is spot on to facilitate this
O- in this wild world of craft beer, tasting is believing. Shaun hill has done just that!!! In under two years (not to mention the 2,000+ craft breweries), he has gone out and produced one of the most delicious Dipa's known to mankind. Ephraim is up there with my best double ipa's.

The body sits a glowing orange color with a one+ finger of creamy, off-white foam. Good retention and spider web lacing coating the inside of the glass.
Ruby red grapefruit, tropical fruit, and ethanol leap out of the glass. Pineapple, mango, apricots, pine resin, orange peel. Intensely hoppy aroma. Malt is an afterthought.
The flavor really explodes mid-palate. A burst of tropical fruit and pine resin with some sugary sweet notes. A mild breadiness holds things down on the back end. This is not an all out onslaught, but rather a calculated attack. Refined.
Medium body, with a dry, bitter finish, engulfed in tropical fruit. Smooth and borderline lush as it rolls around your palate. There is a decent amount of ethanol that lingers, detracting from the delicious flavors.
Ephraim is an excellent beer with tons of delicious flavors and aromas. The booze is a little more in your face than its bretheren, detracting from the overall beer.
I've been lucky to try Pliny the Younger, Heady Topper, and now Ephraim. I will say that Ephraim is firmly in the middle of both. Heady is raw and in your face, while PtY is the well-refined cousin at family gatherings. Ephraim has equal elements of both. Clean and refined, while still being a little brash (in a good way.) 1,302 charactersColForbinBC, Sep 27, 2012

4.76/5  rDev +5.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this up at the Harvest Festival. Great time. 750ml poured into my shiney new Hill Farmstead steam wear. Murky orange / tangerine color with a white one finger head. Lots o' lacing. Tropical. Papaya, passion fruit, citrus zest. Bam, explosion, nothing more to say. Huge tropical flavor, pinapple, passion fruit, papaya, citrus zest, a little pith and pine resin. Hoppy bitterness lingers on the finish. The finish is dry and there is absolutley no way of detecting that this is 10.5% abv. Slightly more carbonation would be nice. Really they only downside to this beer is the appearance. Don't know how they did this. 623 characterspmlondrigan, Sep 25, 2012

4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from tap at the Harvest Festival into provided tulip/wine glass. Very very thick foamy white head sits on top of this straw hazey color. This smell is so fragrant you can smell it well before you bring it to your nose. Strong candied hop aroma, vanilla, and more more more sweet hops. Taste is amazing! Very well balanced malts and hops. Citrus, mango, cotton candy, and a hint of sweet vanilla. This is the best Double IPA I ever had..hands down. Highlight of the Harvest Fest for sure. 494 charactersDrinkSlurm, Sep 24, 2012

3.82/5  rDev -15.1%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750mL growler thanks to oteyj. Pours a clear amber with a modest white head. Looks very different from other samples I’ve had which looked glowin yellow. Nose here is pretty sticky, sugary, muted, candy, maple, orange, 3C hops. Decent. Taste up front is sticky with some very obvious booziness moving to vanilla and maple. But overall, sticky and resinous. Not vey fruity or tropical like I was expecting. Very different from the Double Citra. Good stuff, yummy, but nothing too exciting.
Tap at Capone’s. Definitely not good enough to warrant the iPhone theft that happened to my girlfriend. Small, dense off-white head on a dirty, ugly yellow. Nose is caramel and meaty jackfruit. Taste is boozy, spicy, loads of candied orange slices and orange peel. Sticky, candy body. Butterscotch comes through. Not bad- pretty enjoyable but the opposite of what I was expecting. 10/17/2011 7/3/8/4/15=3.7 900 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

A - Very nice clear orange hie with a one finger head that left super nice side lacing. Very creamy blanket.
S - Dank, musty citrus hops along with some super light/faint pineapple and tropical.
T - Taste is more of the musty goodness with some orangy citrus with more of the subtle pineapple and tropical fruits.
M - Mouthfeel is so creamy, and this ABV is hidden perfectly. Incredibly, and dangerously, drinkable.
O - Excellent example of a super hoppy double IPA. Stuff is crazy good drinkable. So glad I got to try this on tap. Very juicy. 640 charactersrudzud, Feb 10, 2012

Semi clear orange nectar color, nice creamy 1 finger head fades semi slowly with nice lacing.
nose pure hop awesomeness, bit of pine, lots of citrus tropical fruit, guava, passion fruit, some earthy hop, and even a bit of candy. Some light sweet malts underneath.
Taste is more of the same hops, quite bitter, hops galore, pine, citrus, tropical fruit, fresh resin musty, little earthy, candy orange rind and pine. Big malty backbone with bit of sweetness to balance well, and hint of booze. Finish is even more bitter, little sticky but dry, lingering citrus, pine, light musty fresh hop.
Mouth is heavier bodied, decent carb, hint of booze but drinks much better than 10.5%.
Overall awesome but I think I like edward better. Nice balance, juicy hops and malts, a bit more tropical fruits would be more up my alley. 866 charactersjlindros, Dec 30, 2011

*From notes
-- Yet again, many thanks for sharing, Bill --
A: A really healthy presentation. Rich, golden amber and when properly poured, a bubbly 1.25 finger head and decent lacing appear. Really nice retention, as the head lingers for some time.
S: It's floral, yet rather subdued. It's earthy, malty and signifigantly herbal. Lovely, it's really a pleasure to let this drift in and out of the nostrils.
T: This is intense stuff. For as laid back as the bouquet is, the flavor profile is quite the opposite. There's less fruit here, and more of an intensly toasted, almost burnt onion quality to it. It's most certainly rich, and the finish showcases hints of ripe strawberries.
M: The texture is suitable, yet I wish there was more to it. A bit undercarbed, which I'll forgive as it is coming from a growler. But to pack that big of a punch into an almost flabby body is not what I'd call desirable.
O: Hill Farmstead's Ephraim is a very, very good beer that, in my opinion, never reaches the heights of greatness. It certainly knows where it wants to go, yet it wasn't where I felt it needed to be. More of a sipping DIPA, it's one to be shared, as I don't know how one would get down massive quantities of this.
Of the two hoppier HF offerings we imbibed that afternoon, I would have no reservations reaching for their Abner each and every time, as I feel it to be the better and substantially more balanced offering. 1,512 charactersRhettroactive, Dec 11, 2011

Growler to Hill Farmstead glass...as it should be consumed.
From notes. Thanks to CharlieMurphy for sending this amongst other HF treats in a wonderful trade!
A: Dull copper. 1.5+ (pristine white) fingernail head on smooth, soft pour. 
S: Piney. Massive hop aromas. More pine clouded by hint of citrus. Yummy!
T: Malty and sweet tropical fruit followed by an overwhelming brilliant burst of hops (mid-palate to finish).
M: Medium to full-bodied, but very, very smooth for such a high ABV brew. Medium carbonation. 
O: Another excellent output from an up-and-coming brewery. A super drinkable and wickedly enjoyable DIPA that is not too over-the-top, but just right. Can’t wait to pay these folks a visit in-person! 734 charactersspdyfire83, Dec 08, 2011

Pours a clear pale orange with a great white head. Aroma is fruity with pear and melon notes along with some peach. Minimal pine/green hop notes.
Flavor is strong and boozy with a nice candy-like sweetnes in the middle. Finish is overly harsh with high alcohol notes and in the end isn't all that complex.
Mouthfeel is smooth throughout with carbonation on the low side. Nice maltiness creates a substantial body mid palate while still having a dry finish. Definitely the high point of this beer. Overall, I feel the same way about this beer as I did when I had it on tap; booziness overshadows the hop profile. This beer reminds me a lot of hopslam, which I also think is on the wrong side of booze/hop balance. I prefer the less harsh/more aromatic character of HF's other hoppy beers. 878 charactersjeffthecheff, Nov 22, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes. 750ml growler shared with some friends over the weekend. It poured orange in color with a thin, bubbly white head sticking to the edges of the glass. 
The aroma had a bright, citrusy and juicy hop profile to it. I get notes of peach and pineapple to it mixing with a little grapefruit hoppiness. Some sweeter, almost sugary malty flavors come out in it as well. 
The taste also has a juicy, citrus fruit presence to it throughout the flavor. I get a lot of peach and pineapple notes to it, with a touch of grapefruit. It finishes with some sweeter, malty, slightly candy like notes mixing with the juicy hops. It was relatively low on bitterness in the finish for the style as well. 
The mouthfeel was medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it was great beer of the style. It was very big on the juicy, citrusy hoppiness which I liked a lot. Out of the two I tried though this weekend I think I liked Abner slightly better. Abner seemed to balance the juicy citrus with some grapefruit and citrus rind bitterness while Ephraim was all about the juicy, fruity, sweetness. Both were pretty awesome though. 1,137 charactersbillab914, Nov 16, 2011

A - Pours a nice hazy deep orange with a very thin wispy white head. The normal pour barely yielded a head and i'm worried this may be a somewhat flat beer. Whatever head there is seems to crawl to edges of the glass and just sits there leaving some spotty lacing behind.
S - Fresh tropical fruit sweetness. Huge tangerine, mango, pineapple notes are followed by light citrus wafts. Nicely bitter hops are present with a really nice caramel malt base. I’m not a huge fan of the way east coast ipa's smell but this is easily one of the best smelling beers from the east that I have had. 
T – The taste really follows the nose closely. Huge tropical fruits with an initial sweetness quickly give way to a rather intense bitterness and citrus bite. The sweetness from the caramel malt is very evident and provides a good balance which is equally matched with the hop bitterness that I described in the smell.
M - Medium body, with low carbonation. I fear this was a tad on the flat side and would like to try it again to compare. My mouth went through some serious exercises with this beer with all the varied and complex flavors and textures that I provided.
O – This was a truly awesome beer that lived up to the hype for me. I think that this on par with the best DIPA's I have had, hoplsam and Pliny. Is it better than those, no. But is it close, hell yes. Very well done. 1,552 charactersdubinsky, Nov 03, 2011

Appears a beautiful golden apricot with a touch of rouge at its center. Small foamy head is subsiding at a normal rate with a steady effervescent bubbling occurring toward the top half inch. 
Smells very sweet and rich... Like apricot jello. There's a lot if tropical fruit that comes through and I'm really excited to taste what I hope is a heavy hitter. 
Tastes really fruity and bitter in a pleasing way. Grapefruit and pineapple are prominent. It finishes, though, with a bit if a medicinal flavor that reminds me of dark red Robitussin. 
Mouthfeel is pleasing and filled with fresh effervescence. It was pretty creamy and quite fresh from the growler. 
Overall a good beer with a great start but its finish leaves a little bit to be desired. 914 charactersYagman3000, Oct 27, 2011
3.4/5  rDev -24.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Served from a 750ml swing top growler into a tulip glass (thanks Satchboogie). This is probably a 2 week old beer at this point shipped from East to West coast.
Pours a golden color with decent fluffy white head. Plenty of lacing left as I drink it down. About what I would expect. 
The smell is sweet and fruity with a little pine and even some sugary malts. Lots going with the smell, one of the better parts of the beer.
The tastes are kind of earthy, especially for a DIPA. The nice citrusy hops fade quickly and is replaced with sweet tropical fruits. The end is a little more bitter than I expected, not a good or bad thing, just not expected. The sweet flavors are big and all of a sudden you are left with a bitter bite.
Mouthfeel is good for DIPA, nothing spectacular, but good. The alcohol is well hidden, again not good or bad, just there.
I was disappointed in this. I had a Pliny that was a month old just before this and the Pliny had more of a hop profile, a better balance and just an overall better beer (for me). A good beer, but not in the same league as Pliny, Citra, Ruination, Hopslam or Dreadnaught. 1,127 charactersYnot2, Oct 26, 2011

A: Golden, clear body with a one-finger head. 
S: Grapefruit and pineapple hop aromas. Smells superb.
T: Grapefruit, pineapple and other fruity notes are initially present and dominant, giving way to a residual fruitiness and a tiny amount of warming booze. Delicious. 
M: Mouthfeel is definitely thick. Not syrupy, but certainly noticeably on the thicker side. Thick for a DIPA.
O: Overall an extremely solid DIPA, and perfect for autumn in Vermont. I prefer the Double Citra and the Abner, but it seems as though this beer is exactly what it’s aiming to be, a bigger, boozier DIPA than Shaun’s other offerings. Still extremely drinkable for being 10.5%. Another great Hill Farmstead creation. 788 characterstyamhydrogen, Oct 23, 2011

Murky but ultimately clear golden body. Thick, off-white head. Sits atop the body for quite awhile, leaving some nice lacing as it drops.
Pine and citrus, with some papaya. Biscuit malt profile. Some brown sugar sweetness. 
Intense bitterness at first, piney and earthy. Sweet peach fruit flavors. Some subtle biscuit malts. those are immediately put in their place by more pine and tropical fruit hops.
Another winner by Hill Farmstead. An easy drinking DIPA, and who knew this was 10%!?! Phenomenal. 538 characterslitheum94, Oct 22, 2011

The smell is overwhelming of citrus encompassing a cloud of orange, mango, and grapefruit rinds that overcomes you.

Price - $22/Growler
I've had this several times over the last few years and should have reviewed it by now but haven't so here it is.
This beer looks awesome! A huge two inch soapy white head with a long lasting retention covers this golden gem. Lines of bubbles stream from the bottom of my tulip glass and sticky lacing clings to the sides like glue. A quick swirl of the glass and a creamy layer reappears. This beer is screaming for attention.
Aah, the smell of citrus hops is refreshing and appropriate for a DIPA of this size. And with the various types of hops added one can certainly pick up an aroma of something familiar from their hop past. For me it's all about the fruit with caramel malt which adds some sweetness followed by piney resin which is not with out notice.
Grapefruit, orange, mango, and lemon hit the taste buds first followed by honey for a quick flash of raw sweetness. In the end though a big blast of pine with some noticeable alcohol finishes things off.
The mouthfeel pretty much follows in line with a big hop bomb which usually results in a bitter dry finish, as does this. To be expected yes and appropriate. Body is medium and slightly syrupy which I dig.
Overall this beer is just short of fantastic. It's not exactly what I prefer in flavor and mouthfeel, but is so close to the style one has to give it the credit it deserves. Hell it can't be to far off from perfection, I'm nearing the end of my two liters, yikes.. 1,542 characters05Harley, Oct 22, 2011

Somewhat sweet candy like malt a touch alcohol to smell as well. Taste is a load of resionous pine citrus mango citrus rind bitterness. Candy-like sweet malt lets the hops shine through.

Poured into a pint glass.
A - Pours a clear, medium colored orange with a one finger off-white head. Great retention and lots of lacing is left on the glass.
S - Citrus, orange, grapefruit, mongoes, pineapple.
T - A fruit basket here. Citrus, tropical fruit, there is a nice hop pine that is in the background and finishes strong.
D - Good carbontion, average body - a touch of bitterness lingers in your mouth.
O - A very fruity and wonderful IPA. 500 charactersHuskyinPDX, Oct 19, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to partner Mike (Gushue3) for filling this guy up for me and to Sean (I think) providing my second tasting of this brew. Never thought I'd get to try it and I get it twice in one weekend! Poured from a 750ml Hill Farmstead growler and served in a Founders snifter.
A: Pours a chilled hazy amber color, but clears up once it warms up, with a one finger fluffed white head that leaves some splotchy lace down the glass.
S: Smells of sweet fruits, grapefruits, apples, some pine and a little booze all fill those nose. Such extreme variations in hops is really an explosion to the nose. You can also pick up some malts somehow.
T: The taste is just exploding as the nose. Buttery and fruity with a nice sugary sweetness. The main fruit I'm picking out is a sweet apple for some reason. Little resin/pine quality with a full malt body. Finish is a slightly bitter.
M: Medium to light bodied with a nice bubbly carbonation and a very refreshing quality. The drinkability is ridiculous. I could drink this all day, every day.
O: This is my first Hill Farmstead beer and it was great. There was a lot going on with all the hop variations, but it worked out nicely and the drinkability was insane. If only Vermont wasn't an 18 hour drive. 1,242 charactersTreebs, Oct 18, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes, combination of tap and growler tastings:
A: Pours golden pale yellow, mostly clear, with about a finger of white head, somewhat tight, good retention, good lacing.
S: Huge tropical fruits, some orange, lots of pine, floral notes, and a hint of herbal dankness. Light sugary sweet smell.
T: Just about the hoppiest beer imaginable. Tons of floral notes and pine with a little citrus (not as much as the nose) and decent helping of herbal dankness (much more than the nose). Light to moderate level of crystal/light caramel sweetness on a grainy pale malt base. A little bit of hay. About as clean as 10.5% gets. Finish is dry with a fairly big lingering bitterness of pine needles and flowers. Alcohol is very very well hidden. 
M: Medium to slightly full body, moderate to light carbonation, very smooth and velvety/slippery. Not as crisp carbonation as I'd like, it kind of flattens out to the finish. While you can't taste the alcohol, you can certainly get a bit of the heat, especially if you try drinking this too quickly. 
O: A gigantic hop bomb with a balanced hop profile and clean taste, probably the easiest drinking 10%+ DIPA I've had. Very well crafted. That said, it's not my favorite DIPA from Shaun. I do prefer the Abner, Double Galaxy, and Double Citra, but then again, those are 3 of the very very best beers I've ever had. Ephraim is still a fantastic beer and something every hop head should try. 1,442 charactersSatchboogie, Oct 17, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this on 2011-10-15 at Capone's in Norristown, PA at a HIll Farmstead event.
A - Clear golden-orange with a short white head and mild lacing into a 5.5 oz snifter.
S - A strong smelling brew with lots of pineapple, caramel malt, pine, mango and a boquet of hop floral scents. Wonderful.
T - Pineapple, grapfruit, big chalky-dry caramel malt, roasted nuts, which starts moderately sweet but thankfully mostly dries out. You can notice some alcohol, especially on the outbreath. It's very sticky and resinous, coating the mouth for a long time with great flavor and citric bitterness. 
M - Medium body with light carbonation. Smooth, creamy, oily, prickly and resinous.
O - This is quite different from the Abner. This reminds me of Pliny the Younger and the Abner compares favorably with Pliny the Elder. I really love these big triple IPAs when they are so well done, but if I had to pick between the two, I'd go with the double IPA style for better balance and more focus on the citrus and hops than the big malt backbone. This beer ran out second at the event, right after Abner. 1,089 charactersTucquan, Oct 17, 2011

T - good hop presence here with some bread malts lying beneath. great grapefruit edge to this.
M - lots of carbonation medium bodied beer with good hop puckering.

4.44/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served on-tap at Capone's earlier today into a 5.5oz taster glass. I got two just to be sure...
A - Pours clear golden orange with a small half finger tall white head leaving small rings of lace down the glass. I think this one suffered quite a bit from being in that tiny glass.
S - Smells of lightly toasted caramel malt and lots of hops. Initially it is a bit weak but as it warms up the hops just flood the nose. Citric fruit and a touch of pine resin round things out. If not for the slow start this would have been a five.
T - Starts off with a quick taste of caramel malt that is quickly enveloped by the intense citric hop bite. Hints of tropical fruits; mostly grapefruit, pineapple, and mango; help to balance things out a bit. The finish is pretty dry with lots of hop bitterness, lingering on the pallet for a short period of time. Very well balanced yet still intensely hoppy, great stuff.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Slightly sweet, intensely hoppy, feel throughout the entire glass. A tiny bit more carb would have helped but not a huge deal.
O - Having had most of the other hoppy Hill Farmstead beers I can say that this is my new favorite, but only by a very small margin. The hops are strong but not overpowering and it is easy to drink. One of the best for sure. 1,313 charactersorangesol, Oct 15, 2011
4.11/5  rDev -8.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - For a "TIPA" or one of 10.5% ABV, this beer is golden, plenty of activation in the glass and looks like a standard low ABV West Coast IPA. You see right through the glass...very impressive here.
S - Mango's, Pineapple and oranges with a candy sweetness to those fruits I mention...and grassy pine and earth. Nothing overpowering, actually a bit more mellow than I was expecting but very pleasant nevertheless.
T - Much of the same as the nose. Not overpowering but everything plays well together. A little boozy on the back end and the pine plays an equal role here as the tropical fruits. This is a bitter beer, I'd imagine overly bitter for most or some, but for a DIPA of this ABV it works awesome for making this extremely drinkable. Malt backbone there, but plays second fiddle to the hops. Dry and crisp upon finish. Leaving you ready for more - Really reminds me of RRBC's IPA profile...
M - This beer drinks VERY light and feels light for a 10.5% DIPA. Too easy. Like a 7% IPA but make no mistake, you do taste the booze in the finish. Very well balanced. Very much reminiscent of the PtE and PtY mouthfeel here... Blind, I'd assume this was a new RRBC IPA. The ONLY reason this aspect does not receive a 5 from me is that the booze could be masked a bit more. PtY and Terrapin Hopzilla side project 12 does a better job of this.
O - This is a hop-head's must try at least once. Does it live up to the hype....for me almost but just shy. It's a very very good beer but with all the madness lately surrounding it....there are others that match up. Although....I need a on tap specimen to really back that statement up I'm fully aware. Great stuff! 1,663 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Oct 15, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -10%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I received this from a trade and split it at Max's during Baltimore Beer Week. Poured into a goblet.
Appearance: Pours a clear golden/light amber with a half finger of white head that leaves a ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Sweet and extremely hoppy. Some malt, but mostly citrus hops. There is a mild burn at the end.
Taste: This beer can only be described as a hop bomb. Sweet citrus hops crush the tongue immediately. The finish is very bitter with a taste of citrus peel and some alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with tingly carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: I thought this was a good beer, but I liked Abner more when I tried that. This is intense and I couldn't have done more than one glass. 718 charactersoline73, Oct 15, 2011

Poured a gorgeous, clear, golden color.
Smells like a fresh bouquet of flowers with just a hint of pine.
It tastes slightly bitter upfront followed by a ridiculously citrusy and floral hop flavor. The theoretical 280 IBUs are definately there. 
The hop oils abound. It is sticky and pretty thick. I just want to hold it in my mouth forever!

3.94/5  rDev -12.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a 750 mL growler into a tulip. Thanks to CharlieMurphy for shipping me this WaLe. 
Appearance: The pour is hazy copper color, kind of a faint color. A light creamy head forms on the pour and leaves some light lace on the glass. 
Smell: The aroma is full of caramel malt, some honey, pineapple, a little grapefruit, and some herbal notes. More sweet than bitter. 
Taste: The flavor starts sweet and retains a honey and caramel fruity sweetness throughout each sip. The hoppy notes are full of pineapple, dank notes, spicy pine, and a little bit of grapefruit. The finish is bitter, but the sweetness really resonates with on my palate.
Mouthfeel: The feel is lighter than the 10.5% ABV would lead me to have expected. It starts sweet and fnishes a little more dry, with a fair amount of hop resin. 
Overall: For a sweet DIPA, this was pretty good. Compared to the whole range of DIPA's this is slightly better than mediocre. 940 charactersKickInTheChalice, Oct 14, 2011
3.92/5  rDev -12.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to KickInTheChalice for this one. Pour from a 750 ml growler into a Parra Duvel tulip.
Pours an unusual golden orange color. When held up to the light it's a light golden orange.
Lots of honey and caramel malt on the aroma - then it fades into dank hops and with a hint of citrus and tropical fruit. Really impressive.
Taste doesn't live up to the nose - bitter hops dominate - not as much malt and sweetness as the nose indicates. It's still sweet, but the sweetness is overwhelmed by piney, hoppy bitterness. It lacks the crisp clarity of sweet then hoppy that I appreciate in other sweet DIPAs that I've had.
Mouthfeel is good. Medium bodied, fairly heavy for a DIPA, decently carbed, but not as creamy or smooth as would be ideal.
Overall - a solid beer, but doesn't deserve it's top 100 status in my book. 822 charactersreadbaron, Oct 14, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Part of a very generous unsolicited package from fellow BA and good friend rfgetz.
A - Two fingers worth of frothy moderately fluffy head that has a slight bit of orange tinge to it... Excellent retention ultimately gives way to mostly full rich lacing... The color is a clean crisp medium color... Limited carbonation most of which is sluggish and rises along the sides of the glass with a couple of stray quick moving bubbles rising in the middle of the glass... A bit of chunky froth clings to the sides of the glass... 
S - An absolutely stellar nose that is the best of all things hops... A mix a wonderful fruit aroma... Orange... Mango... A touch of pineapple... Some kiwi... Buried beneath the first layer of fruit is a nice mix of piney character... Earthy and outdoorsy... Faint evergreen... Buried way beneath the surface is a touch of malt backbone... Near perfection for the style...
T - The expected waves of hop goodness don't disappoint... Equal parts citrus and pine work together in harmony to create wonderful character and complexity... A brisk malt back bone emerges closer to the finish with lots of doughy bread and cracker notes... An ever so faint alcohol induced "burn" on the finish that lingers for a bit... Extremely complex with new notes detected after each and every sip...
M - Medium bodied... Surprisingly dense... Lightly carbonated... Sleek and smooth... Even and consistent... A slightly intoxicating alcohol induced warmth... 
D - Exceptional all the way around... Very seldom to beers live up to the hype, but this one does... So much flavor, character, depth, and complexity loaded into one growler... This is why I love beer... This is truly work of art...
Kudos again to rfgetz again for the generosity... 1,753 charactersphilbe311, Oct 12, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to kingkong for this one! Counter-pressure filled growler into a glass.
A - Orange/copper clear. Nice-sized creamy head which isn't uber-thick but lingers nicely. Good lacing.
S - Hops and hops and hops! First whiff is a sweet grapefruit with background orange. Second is grassy orange and lemon. From time to time pine sticks its head through. This one's all about the hops, and it's all about the citrus hops, fairly sweet as far as hop aromas go. Just fantastic.
T - More from the nose. Layers of hops. Sweet and resiny hops up front. Grapefruit and every other kind of citrus comes in with a backing of pine and grass, along with just about any orange/yellow-colored fruit you can think of. The sweetness comes from both the resiny character and just the tiniest hint of malts to balance it juuuust a bit, but the sweetness is totally front-mid. The back end is bitter, bracingly bitter. Just all-around fantastic. That 10.5% doesn't even show up, really, but I can feel my taste buds turning to little tiny hops.
M - Very good. Carbonation is great from the counter-pressure. A little syrupy is the only detraction here.
Overall a really fantastic beer that I'm very glad I got the opportunity to try. Best IPA I've tried. 1,244 charactersOSUBeerStudent, Oct 12, 2011
3.5/5  rDev -22.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5From a Growler. Giddie Up.
Color is a sunburst golden amber color, like a light resin nugget. Picture the piece of resin from jurrasic park that they extract the mosquito dna from, that color right there hits it. 
The aroma is predominantly citrus and grapefruit, and just a hint of mango and tropical pulls through, but citrus is by far the winner in this aromatic battle of domination.
The flavors match the aroma, with the exception that the faint tropics are replaced with a faint pine grove, but this pine grove still has 10x the grapefruit trees in comparison. This one is very bitter, it doesn't only have hop flavors but a lot of bitterness also, balanced slightly but a bit of residual sugars. 702 charactersChadQuest, Oct 11, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at the brewery for their harvest festival, served in a Hill Farmstead stem. 
Hop-hazed orange with a creamy head that leaves plenty of lacing. A bright inviting color on a dreary, cold rainy day.
Nose of all sorts of luscious ripe fruits - peach, pineapple, tangerine, papaya, mixed with sweet bread.
The flavor follows on the nose - with a little concentration, it seems like just about any sort of ripe fruit can be conjured up on the tongue, along with a bit of pine for balance. Plenty of bready sweetness provides a foundation for the hops, but does not detract one bit. 
Mouth coating sweetness is punctured by layers upon layers of sticky hoppiness. Dry finish and although it seems like a cliche for such beers, very drinkable for the adv.
In a word, sublime. I usually think of myself preferring Abner to Ephraim. But this batch of Ephraim sets the standard for imperial IPA for me. Shaun served a lot of amazing beers at the harvest fest and yet Ephraim stands out as an amazing experience. 1,012 charactersCliffBrake, Oct 11, 2011
4.03/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to mtardiff for providing this gem in trade. Marc is an excellent trade partner.
Pours with a finger of thick tight bright white head that shows excellent retention. The beer is a bright clear brass color with no visible carbonation. Some nice lace clings to the glass. At times the deposits are quite thick.
Bright sweet juicy aroma. Not quite as floral as I would have guessed. A touch of grapefruit, but much more juicy sweet thick fruit. A slight whiff of the alcohol to come.
Lots going on here. The flavor is as thick as the aroma. Initial sweetness, flips to thick fruit and then a moment of alcohol. This then melds into a nice finish that is part light malt and resin like bitterness from thick green hops. No doubt a nice beer, but the alcohol is a bit too present for my liking. A pretty thick dose of mango comes through as I drink this. This mixes well with the alcohol flavor.
Pretty thick and sticky DPA. Again the word juicy applies.
I am surprised that this beer is getting some of the highest scores from Hill Farmstead. It’s good, but does not reach the heights of some of their other brews. Having said that, this is rarified air since most of their beers are quite excellent.
Thanks Marc 1,227 charactersReagan1984, Oct 10, 2011

750ml swingtop growler provided by afksports. 
It pours an amazing bronze with one of the most impressive heads I've ever seen on a 10.5% DIPA. This thing stayed around forever. I poured it in the HF stemmed Belgian tulip. Ephraim left me some sort of hieroglyphic etchings all over the sides of my glass. Such detailed lacing, it was incredible. 
Gobs and Gobs of tropical fruits. Tangerines, oranges, apricots, slight lemon, and some unripe pineapple. Slight drying from the hops, but the caramel malt stands side by side with it to make subtle the hops.
Taste is full of citrus, beautiful ripe tangerine notes and an ever so slight lemon bite. Again, there is a big blanket of caramel malt that gets drowned out fairly quickly by the hop bite. Neither are over done, and they work wonderfully together.
Mouthfeel is uber creamy. You can tell this is a BIG beer from the mouthfeel. Creamy and chewy, especially for a DIPA. 
Hill Farmstead is amazing. They have created the most balanced DIPA on the planet and easily sit in front of Pliny, Citra, Heady Topper, etc. Ephraim deserves all the respect it gets. This is an outstanding beer that I will forever donate my cellar towards to get just one more taste. I felt bad at first. My brother was suppose to make it over tonight to split this with me, but he got caught up in some stuff. Now, after having my second pour, I'm just sorry this wasn't a 2L growler so I could have a few more pours all to myself. Thanks again Brendan! 1,547 charactersDearthVader, Oct 10, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Growler picked up at the brewery yesterday, 10/8. Poured into their Belgian stemware glass.
A - Pours a typical light caramel-gold with a thin wisp of head. Head is retained at this wisp-level throughout. Nice clarity and a decent amount of carbonation. The head and carbonation levels make it look like a lower ABV beer-- it is impressive for a beer at 10.5% to look like this. A more aggressive re-fill yielded a larger, frothy head, which dissipated at an average rate.
S - Fresh tropical fruit sweetness, bitter hops, and a subtle caramelly malt base. One of the better-smelling east-coast IPAs I have had. You can smell the grains as if you were walking through the Hill Farmstead fields.
T - An initial sweetness transforms quickly into intense bitterness. The caramel provides the sweetness, but just can't compete with the hops. Strong notes of grapefruit and a hint of papaya. Finishes with a bomb of bitterness that only a hophead could enjoy. No booze at all, which is amazing.
M- Medium to full in body, this beer is a big one. It envelops your mouth and fires on every tastebud. Initially round, it sharpens very quickly. Finish dries out the mouth, but not too much.
O - Overall this beer is exceptional. While I don't think it gets any one category perfect, it exemplifies each to a degree that few other beers can. The bitterness is intense, and would overwhelm the unprepared, but at at "280 IBU" level, that makes perfect sense. I think I might still prefer Heady Topper to this beer as far as East Coast IPA whales go, but I wouldn't mind having this every day, either! I need to get my hands on some Abner, since that'll compare more closely to what Head Topper really is.
 Is this the Pliny the Younger of the East Coast? Hard to say. I'm going to go with "Maybe." 1,791 charactersgreenmonstah, Oct 09, 2011

4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750 mL growler poured into a goblet. Massive thanks to Ernesto987/Kirchhoff for hooking me up with this.
Appearance - Hazy golden orange body with a slightly dark tint to it. Reminds of Lunch and canned Heady Topper in this regard. Something about NE IPAs that have a slight darkness to their otherwise bright look. Not a huge head, but what's there is a sticky and lacey and all that is wondeful.
Smell - Gobs of citrus hops. Man I wish I could bottle that smell. I don't wear cologne, but I'd wear citrus hop cologne every day just to smell myself. Amazingly, the sweetness is there, but even at 10.5% it doesn't dominate in the aroma.
Taste - The sweetness does come through in the taste, but it's secondary to the hops and it even incorporates itself pretty well. Once the waves of citrus hops die down, the sweetness comes about in mango and pineapple flavors. It's as if the malt is an appendage of the hops. It finishes ever-so-slightly bitter.
Mouthfeel - Low carbonation. I wonder if that's a growler thing or if that's just how it is. I didn't notice any leakage, but airtight is a different animal from liquid tight (is that even a valid phrase?). The body comes off a bit heavy from the lack of carbonation, but the flavors bring you back for more and more.
Overall - I'm moving to Vermont. And I need more Hill Farmstead IPAs. I suppose the numbers I choose to rate this beer say it's not as good as Heady Topper and Pliny, but to decide that one is better than the other is an insult to the ability of the individual brewers. Bravo and give me more.
Edit: Numbers changed based on futher growlers. This shit is incredible. Edward is delicate. Ephraim stuffs Edward's delicacy in a locker and steals his lunch money. 1,735 charactersAlieniloquium, Oct 09, 2011

Smells of citrus, tropical fruits with a little bit of earthiness.
Up front lots of citrus flavors with a little bit of sweet maltiness. Rounds out into a sweet pineapple flavor near the end with a crisp finish.
Mouthfeel is fairly light. Carbonation level is low, but I'm assuming that has to do with the growler.
Very solid beer. I love the distinct pineapple flavor, but having had this right after Heady Topper it falls short of that standard. 508 charactersjmarsh123, Oct 07, 2011

A- Pours a bright clear amberish gold hue from bottle. A neat ivory head forms. Sits a great clear amber color in glass. Good lacing. 
S- Wow! really fresh and tropical. Fresh picked pineapple ( both sweet and tangy) and orange dominates. Some sweet caramel malt in background with some mellow spice. Really great. 
T- hard to find words. Takes a departure from the aroma. Smooth waves of fresh tropical hop magic wash over the palate. Pineapple, papaya & orange. The caramel malt is just strong enough to support the hop showcase. Some spicy pine resin in the end and finish that really lingers. The malt in the finish is dry rye crackers. Really smooth. Could just be a little crisper. 
M- a BIG full DIPA that is surprisingly smooth. The bitterness is there in the flavor but fades to leave the palate in a useable state. Feels like a velvety blanket of hop flowers. Starts wet then slowly dries. 
O- A truly great DIPA. So fortunate to have been able to try this brew. With DIPA being one of my favorite styles and one that I am most critical of, I can declare this an amazing brew. I could drink this all night and not get bored. Easily one of the best I have ever had. After 3/4 of the bottle, the 4 hour drive to the brewery isn't looking so long and the weekend will quickly be here. 1,423 charactersbusterthecat, Oct 04, 2011

Ephraim pours a clear, light amber color with a small, creamy white head on top. The foam lingers on the surface and leaves behind a fair amount of lacy spots on the glass.
The strong hoppy aroma is loaded with orange and grapefruit citrus, with a touch of lemon rind and pine.
Each sip of this full bodied beer is creamy, lightly carbonated and moderately chewy. The flavor is full of grapefruit citrus, pine and lemon rind. There's enough caramel and toasted malt sweetness in the background to balance out the hoppy bitterness. It finishes bitter, grassy and dry with a lingering grapefruit citrus when gone.
For nearly 11% abv this is a very drinkable beer. I just wish it was easier to find. Still, a trip to northern Vermont is always terrific. 856 charactersWanderingFool, Oct 02, 2011

A: This beer exudes an amazing golden profile straight out of the bottle. I don’t want to reach for an Alad- ok it feels like a hop genie. The pour reveals a petulant ghost that traveled 3000 miles to meet my mouth and isn’t too disturbed by the prospect. Nice lacing, the glass looks as baroque as the day will allow with marshmellow foam everywhere. The rim feels like a late 90s rave/foam party. You know the drill.
S: This must feel what old Sutter felt like when he discovered gold at his mill, except replace gold with amazing hop assault to my dome piece. It initially hissed when I opened the growler and a hop cloud literally escaped like Patrick Swayze and nestled an herbal dissonance on my couch. Ok, not literally. But it smelled a lot like husking limes, apricots, tangerines, and lemons: WHICH I DO OFTEN.
T: Things get real in the field once it touches your lips. This beer is fantastic and, wait for it, is likely the best DIPA that I have ever had. I know this betrays my Pliny roots and the west coast in general but it just cannot be denied or overstated. The hops start out in a sweet/tart note then the deceptacons gather and a huge herbal robot assembles all up in my grill. HE BEGS FOR AMISTAD. The herbal wafts expand like I am all into home growing except my mouth is the botanical garden, and there is only consumption.
M: This beer has an amazing character that I would liken to a Subaru STI, an incredible speed and efficiency to it that just whips me about effortlessly, takes my money, and leaves me wanting more. The coating is minimal but perfectly balanced for the style. It somehow doesn’t fall into the old trap of east coast IPAs where there foolishly seek balance. This is just crazy from beginning to end.
D: I can’t even seriously address this section without hyperbole. Live Oak Hef and this beer need to go head to head for the most ridiculously drinkable beer ever made. I will judge Live Oak Hef the winner but only for its galleon speed and not the man-o-war impressive notes that this beer imparts. In sum, this beer is incredible and the growler barely made its way to the Stone Sour Fest where it was met with mild nods of approval and summarily dispatched. For a beer so apparently lackluster, its 64oz were torn limb from limb. My handkerchief remained damp throughout the proceedings.
Narrative: “If you know not for the elusive Ephramus, it is because he is of the forest, never to be held.” The camp counselor told the youth, staring into their entranced faces. “Many years ago, I was visited, if only for fleeting moments, down by the lake, by Ephramus.” One child whose front two teeth were clearly missing whistled annoying “geesy, tells us more counshelors Morrish!” Counselor Morris lowered his brow severely, “if you ever see the Ephramus ghost, you must flee immediately, for it will consume your heart and spirit as easily as I consume this Fruit by the Foot.” Demonstratively, he consumed 3 feet of fruit roll up, much to the dismay of the children. Suddenly, Ephramus approached the campfire and moaned waning, “Ooooohhh Morrisss you could have invoked me more ofteeeennnn but you refused to payyy Fed Exxx” Counselor Morris fell to his knees with careless abandon, sobbing. He knew that he gave up his love for his bitter distrust of shipping systems. Ephramus never crossed the streams. 3,432 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, Jul 28, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Snifter poured from growler shared by a urbancaver.
Pours a clear dark golden color with a small bubbly white head. 
The intense aroma comes leaping from the glass bringing tropical fruits, grapefruit, honey sweetness and a touch of pine. The nose is first class. 
The flavor does not disappoint either. More big tropical fruits, citrus, grapefruit, a sweet caramel malt base, honey, and more pine noticeable toward the finish. I don’t know about 280 IBU’s, but the bitterness it has is well integrated. 
This is insanely drinkable for what it is. Medium plus body and super smooth for a DIPA. I would have to classify this as an instant classic. 654 charactersajsdad06, Jul 20, 2011

Growler Hill farmstead ephiram (thanks capra!): pours a gorgeous orange honey copper with decent head for a 1 ounce pour. The smell is hops all day, but super balanced. This is a 5 smelling beer. I could just sit and smell it, I don’t even need to drink it, but I will. Very balanced taste, hop forward, a touch bitter on the hops. Medium mouth feel, little bitter, little bitter. Overall great beer, glad I got this tick and look forward to our next...
-- EDIT -- had again on 2011-10-26...thanks baconsausage for the 32oz growler.
4 - 5 - 4.5 - 4 - 4.5
same look, perhaps a bit more read...much more sizeable pour yields head at first but that goes quick. i agree with my original assessment of smell. for the flavor, it is 100% grapefruit. nothing else. it tastes EXACTLY like grapefruit. still pretty bitter finish after a sweet grapefruit blast. 918 characterscosmicevan, Jul 05, 2011

Served from growler into a Southern Tier tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a one and a half finger very slightly off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and pot. The flavor was of sweeet malt, earth, citrus, citrus hop, and pot. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was just plain excellent. Not really any other way to say it. All of the aspects on this one just stood out to your senses to let you know that you were having a great beer. The aroma on this one was other-worldly for the style. You would have never known this was 10.5% at all, and I could see that getting a lot of people in a lot of trouble really easily. Really glad I finally got to tick this beast! 933 charactersthagr81us, May 16, 2011

the pour was insane as a crystal clear amber color came gurgling out of the glass. a three inch high head of white comes up and tops the glass and leaves tons of sticky and web like lacing down the glass.
such a fresh herbal smell, wreaks of cannabis with lots of sticky pine and semi sweet orange notes that percolate through. the flavor is as intense as the aroma if it was possible. so clean and fresh i was literally blown away by this beer. the alcohol is non existent but the hops are soo strong but soo clean without any bite. the smoothest it could possibly be.
overall this one is up there with pliny and citra. it is certainly worthy of it reputation! 855 charactersmikesgroove, May 15, 2011

A: Clear, glowing orange-gold body with a nice cap of rough off-white bubbles. Good retention for the strength. Attractive, and its paleness promises a real, pure hop-bomb.
S: Yup, this is hugely hoppy. Tons of spice, grapefruit, spruce, pine, grass, and earth. Just about every possible aspect of hop aroma (except, notably, sweet tropical fruits) jumps out of the glass. Lovely.
T: Full, rich, overpowering hoppiness. Everything from the nose comes through in spades, delivering wave after wave of deliciousness. Super bitter finish, but still with plenty of great flavor. The pine is unreal - Ephraim is hands-down the piniest, resiniest DIPA I've ever had, and I love it.
M: Smooth, slick body - quite viscous, and lightly carbonated. Good, but not as great as everything else about this beer.
O: Fantastic beer, plain and simple. It's incredible to me how a 10.5% brew could manage to taste like absolutely nothing but hops - no caramel or bready malt, no alcohol. The hop profile wasn't quite as much to my personal tastes as, say, Heady Topper, but I can see how many people could find this to be the best DIPA in the world. Awesome, awesome beer.

Aromas of citrus and lemon peel mingle nicely with a slight herbaceous character. Flavors of grapefruit rind and piney hops dominate this very hoppy brew. Sticky hop presence with nice body and a creamy mouthfeel lead to a finish showing some of the herbal components and the perfect amount of malt. With the abv on this it didn't come across hot at all and was a bit too easy to drink This one lived up to the hype and I can't wait to get my hands on this again as it blew me away from the first sip. 569 characterswino47, May 07, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Review from notes taken on 4/23/11. On Tap at Capones served in a 6oz snifter. This brew appears a clear golden copper color that haze some hop haziness about it keeping it from being perfectly clear. There are some orange and yellowish hues about the brew when it is held to the light. A finger of white fluff holds decent across the top leaving webby and spotty lacework on the glass.
The smell of this brew is extremely juicy with hops. It fills the nose with fruit and rinds along with dank indications, weed and herbs. There is a faint toasty malt backing that provides a solid base of sweetness for the bright fruity hops to play off. The smell of this brew is very enjoyable. As it warms, it picks up some catty notes that come across to me as even being a bit cheesy.
The taste of this brew is dank and oily with hop resins. It is modestly bitter, dank, grassy, herbal, oily and very resinous. It lingers in the mouth with a rindy aftertaste. Lots of alcohol warmth and fusel flavor is well integrated into this brew and enjoyable. A Attu aftertaste is evident that evolves into a flavor I keep associating with cheese...interesting just like the nose.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is dry and spicy in the finish but includes a lingering oily resinous power that lasts inside the mouth and seemingly coats it. Overall this is an exceptionally well balanced brew with a significant hop bite, depth and balance. Excellent job and cheers to Hill Farmstead for a top shelf product. 1,527 charactersstakem, May 06, 2011

S: Fruity citrus--grapefruit, orange, and pineapple--plus a bit of pine. Very nice, but not the same depth of fruity goodness of something like fresh sculpin.
T: A nice fruit forward amped up IPA. The flavors are muted, and although there is a bit going on here, it doesn't have the same layered complexity of PtY where you can get lost for days in the flavor interactions.
M: Medium bodied, effervescent on the tongue. Nice level of bitterness leaves a refreshing finish.
O: Overall this is a VERY NICE imperial ipa. That said, I can name quite a few that I'd easily take over this. I am sure this was better the day it was first tapped at the Farmstead though. 769 characterscallmemickey, Apr 30, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I am so happy to have a second chance to enjoy this great beer -this time on tap at Capone's in Norristown 4/23/11 served chilled in a snifter and allowed to gradually raise in temperature.
 From the very beginning I am anticipating good things -the color is sunflower golden light amber with resplendent appearance when held to the light. Only a mild amount of haze from hop resins with a thick band of cream and lace stickage is great as the bead is tiny. The fragrant smell of hops emanates from the glass immediately as I bring Ephraim to my nose dank odors of herbs and citrus with lots of floral esters fill my nostrils. The grapefruit accents and there is certainly an element of tropical aroma with some grassy bitter notes. I really enjoy the mild sweet ester that backs giving a huge tangerine element to the IPA, so juicy and a slight catty accent is there making me think of Simcoe w/ mild pineapple and light candied fruit aroma. 
 The feel is juicy and mildly resinous right away, but a high bitter quality backs up the intense hop jolt to the palate with a spiced edge and smooth bitterness is the key to the feel in that there is not much in the way of astringency, just some really nicely layered hop textures giving way to a mild alcohol intensity and mild malt with tons of hoppy body throughout into the semi-dry finish. I taste sweet glorious hops right off - a slight resinous effect carries a subtle acidic flavor and mild pineapple bitter and sweet taste with some herbal elements and tangerine is following closely with a really intense citric bite. The mild golden grapefruit and mild kumquat with tanginess makes you want to rub your tongue against the roof of your mouth. It has a puckering lingering bitter and fruity edge w/ light malt just offsetting the taste in the middle giving brief respite while the second thrust of hop bitterness comes forward in a wave to carry through to the dry mild tea like astringent and herbal lasting dry edge in the finish. 
Overall I can't say it enough, just a phenomenal example of an Imperial IPA, I think this just delivers exactly what it promises and more. It has the bitterness, flavor and aroma without the assault on the palate, it has subtlety which gives you the feeling of an exciting ride without being beaten into submission -Dank American Hops, just can't find many Imperial IPA's that do it better, period. 2,391 charactersSlatetank, Apr 27, 2011

Big thanks to HopScotch for sharing this super popular new IIPA from Vermont. I was really looking forward to this beer. Will it live up to the hype?
BIG TIME! Jesus, this is what a double IPA should be. Tons of citrus and piney hop flavor, with a solid body, and a nice hint of malt/caramel on the back-end.
OK, so it lives up to the hype, but does it compare to Pliney, Hopslam, Dreadnaught, and other awesome IIPA’s? Well pretty good but its not a Fresh Pliney. I’d say 2nd best IIPA I have ever had. I will be on the look out for more beers from this brewery, and will work on making a trip to Vermont. 675 charactersDosBeerigos, Apr 26, 2011

A - Poured a sunny golden liquid with a dried apricot haze and a wispy white head that diminished to reveal plenty of lacing reminiscent of cheese cloth. 
S - Ephraim's pungent nose drips with juicy citrus and tropical fruits, a distinct herbal dankness and fresh pine. Wow! While there is a lot going on here with the hop character, this DIPA boasts one of the most unabashedly citrus aromas I've ever come across. 
T - Intense hop character bursting with citrus, tropical fruit and pine, just as the nose forewarned. There is a malt presence, which adds support by way of sweet, grainy notes. Some alcohol heat poked its way through as the liquid warmed. Finish is well-balanced yet still retains a full hop character and aggressive bitterness without being over the top. 
M - Medium bodied with an oily texture and crisp, zippy carbonation. Finishes with an assertive bitterness that lingers on the palate for quite some time. 
D - Delicious hop bomb that is up there with the best of 'em. Would love to have this side by side with PIY and Dreadnaught in an ultimate DIPA throwdown! 1,121 charactersffejherb, Apr 25, 2011

The beer pours a golden peach color with very good head retention and considerable lacing. This beer is very aromatic, showcasing dry citrus, fruit cocktail, orange marmalade, vanilla and considerable pine. The flavor profile tends to replicate the nose pretty closely in this tasty DIPA. Also, while there is a considerable tropical fruit component to this beer, there's more than enough hoppy goodness to balance it, leading to a long, bitter, pine infused finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to full, and while you can tell the alcohol is up there in this one, the beer is not at all hot or boozy on the finish. 
This is an excellent DIPA, no doubt about that. Still not sure I'd put it in the same category as Hopslam, younger and elder, but there's no denying that this is a well made, well crafted DIPA. 844 charactersJohn_M, Apr 25, 2011

Tropical fruit hoppiness upfront, slightly floral but most of the fruit. 
hop flavor is sweet and fruity. slightly bitter though not as much as expected. slight alcohol burn in my chest, but none in the flavor. It's 10.5% abv so expected. Slight orange juice notes add some complexity that I thoroughly enjoy. This is one tasty brew.

Bright white head that hangs around for awhile on top of a crisp, hazed golden orange body. 
Aroma is showing no signs of age and is still flawless. Tons of fresh, ripe tropical sweetness and mild cane sugar. Pungent, hoppy and balanced with no trace of alcohol. Perfect.
Flavor is showing some signs of age. Bitter and resiny hops are still abundant but some of the tropical sweetness has been blunted. Biscuity malts are a little stronger than I remember as well. Nice, but no longer perfect. 
Exceptionally dry with a medium full body and strong, fine carbonation. 
Regardless, this is an exceptional DIPA, but it has tasted better. 854 charactersyourefragile, Apr 23, 2011

A - Crisp and colorful, dominated by a yellow/orange profile with a nice white head that pulls back and leaves a moderate level of stickiness on the glass. 
S - For my money, this is the shining part of the beer. Grapefruit, citrus, and pine all come forward in an intoxicating manner.
T - Now I will temper this somewhat by saying that hop-bombs are not my favorite style. This one assaults you with bitterness, strong pine, and citrus flavors. An edge of malt lies in the background, but the real punch is in the hoppy frutiness and pine flavors. Personally, a little too much for me but again not my preferred style. I leave it to the experts to debate this v. Younger and the other leaders of the DIPA pack. 
M - Tart with the bitterness again dominating the experience.
O - OK, so I am glad that I tried it but I would not offer up my cellar to obtain this beer simply because it is not my cup of tea (or hops). Still, glad to have had the opportunity to try this beer since so many talk about it. Thanks again Matt for another great event. 1,234 charactersBeerisheaven, Apr 23, 2011

A- Ephraim looks the part, shades of golden orange with some tangerine looks. a nice amount of white foam on top that leaves minor stickage. Decent retention, while some swirls brings it back.
S- A really pungent bouquet of hop aroma blasting out. Smells of ripe tropics such as grapefruit and pineapple with a decent amount of pine. A array of hop types in here, probably including Summit(slight onion), thanks for the tip Bill.
T- First sips, Ephraim just comes out swinging. An assult of hop flavor and tropic mixed in with pine in the beginning. Some malt biscuit barely makes a whimper in between. Just a bit of summit hop flavor under a bevy of others. It's interesting and worth the praise, just not my top pick.
M- Like said, hops and bitterness basically envade the mouth. Astringent and really grabs ahold of the tounge. Medium bodied and carbed up from the tap. Great beer burps afterwards and the flavor sticks around with me forever.
O- A great beer and a banging double eye. Very drinkable, but the bitterness can deter for a bit. the tropics are not as large as expected, Abner really shines in that department. This is another beast. 1,174 charactersBARFLYB, Apr 23, 2011

A- comes to me in a small snifter with a nice cap of bright white head that has a bit of hold before settling to a thin ring and a nice spray of lace. Lightly hazy golden yellow orange in color. 
S- super bold tropical hops bust out of this one like you wouldn't believe with tangerines, mangos, pineapple, the grapefruit is in there as well. Light powdered sugar sweetness. Very impressive. 
T- aggressive hop bite right up front with an astringent grapefruit and under ripe pineapple. Tropics are less then the nose but still play a roll. Malts bring a lot of dry biscuit and a bit of sweetness but very light up against the hopping. Unbelievably long bitter hoppy finish. 
M- a bit above medium in body with a bright carb that really tingles all over. Super dry finish. 
O- this lives up to the hype but that being said I like abner better. E is a monster hop bomb and a very good one at that. I hope this and many more hill beers make it down. 983 charactersoglmcdgl, Apr 23, 2011

The nose on this beer is absolutely fantastic. Just bursting through with a ton of tropical and citrus fruit along with some slight earthy pine, pale malt and sweet booze. Lots of mango and pineapple as well as some grapefruit and lemon peel. One of the best smelling IPAs I've encountered.
This beer looks great and smells incredible but unfortunately the flavor falls way off. The citrus and tropical fruit notes are there but anywhere near as prominent as the aroma suggests. More bitter and earthy than expected with piny/soily flavor but not overly dry. Also, it is very hot and the strong booze component kills the best of the hop flavor. Hints of grapefruit and lemon peel with a very faint tropical presence. The malt backbone is also stronger than expected with hints of biscuit and an overly grainy graham cracker presence. Toward the end of the palate the beer is almost all booze. Kind of all over the place an very disappointing.
I have heard very good things about this beer and was really looking forward to it but it was an enormous let down. I'm gong to be trying it again on draft in a few days and will update my review if my opinion changes. 1,341 characterscorby112, Apr 18, 2011

Today two full 12oz glasses of this hoppy nectar. It poured a wonderful dark golden color, with pretty decent clarity considering it is unfiltered. Little head that faded pretty quick, not a ton of carbonation either. The nose was packed full of citrus deliciousness, pineapple and grapefruit mostly. The taste was more of a pine and grapefruit rind that finishes with an outstanding hop-bitterness. One of the best DIPA's i've had in a while, so lucky i was able to have more than one serving of this. 620 charactersbonbini26, Apr 12, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was just flat-out ridiculous. It reminded me only of one other beer, an old DIPA I made 5 years ago with 294.6 theoretical IBUs that was 9.5%. So this one was 280 theoretical IBUs and 10.5%. No heat, all face-fucking hops. Big nasty bitterness, and to all those who "can't taste" above 100 IBUs or don't know the difference, I'm sorry. Some can, if you can't, then oh well. But this was a big beautiful bitter. I've never had a commercial beer approach this level. The next closest would be Bitter Bitch from Astoria. 
I stood turgid in Blind Tiger, trying not to poke people standing next to me, for fear of being kicked out and not allowed to have any more. Pine, grapefruit, mangoes, sticky icky. Jesus, this was beautiful. Truly substantiated hype about this brewery and the beers being made here. Praise be to the Blind Tiger for hosting this event today. I cannot wait to put this down my throat again. 913 charactersdragonWhale, Apr 11, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Growler shared by Grant - much obliged!
Pours a hazy light copper color with a one-finger slightly off-white head. The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells of soft pale malts with large amounts of citrus and light floral hops. Also present are hints of tropical fruit and lighter hints of herbal hops.
Tastes similar to how it smells. Smooth pale malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by citrus and slight herbal hops. Midway through the sip hints of breadiness work their way into things before being pushed aside by mild tropical fruit flavors. The tropical fruit, pale malt, and citrus flavors carry through to a moderately bitter ending.
Mouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with smooth carbonation.
Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall this was a very easy-drinking beer and the only thing keeping it from entering the upper tier of the style was a defining characteristic - nothing about it is outstanding. A very nice beer with no flaws that's worth a shot. 1,085 charactersglid02, Apr 03, 2011
3.65/5  rDev -18.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Drank on Mar. 25th.
Was really looking forward to trying this after hearing so much about it and having had Farmstead Citra which I thought was pretty damn good.
Appearance: Has a dark golden color to it with not a ton of carbonation. White head that disappeared pretty quick.
Smell: Has some nice tropical smells to it. Mostly Citrus with mango and a little pineapple. I am also getting some apricot smells and a little hot alcohol in the smell.
Taste: Has a ton of citrus in the first part of the taste that quickly goes to a decent amount of bitterness. I was a little disappointed there was not much malt to balance this out much. No real biscuit flavors like I get with Kern Citra. I also get a little hotness from the alcohol which i was surprised about but could be due to the lower side of the carbonation.
Mouthfeel: This one is really thin and I thinks that's why it taste's hot to me. Poured with some carbonation initially but the head faded quick and the taste became a little more one dimensional.
Overall: I liked this IPA but would say I am not seeking this one out again. In the end it does not come close to my favorite double IPA--Kern Citra which is my measuring stick. Maybe if it had better carbonation and a little stronger smell I would think different. I liked Hill Farmstead Citra much better for sure. Citra had a better nose and way better overall taste to it. Glad I got to try it. 1,415 charactersRampage1, Apr 02, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Yet another overt thanks to a top-notch trader, baconsausage, who tossed this growler my way with no expectation of anything in particular in return. In turn, the growler was shared with a bunch of other BAs & non-BAs at an impromptu weekend tasting. Reviewed from admittedly sketchy notes. 
Pours an amber, leaning towards yellow, plenty of pop in the head even after hundreds of miles of travel. Smell is dead-on luscious, tons of citrus, grapefruit, a frontal assault of all that is good & holy about the hop. Top of the line nose on this one, just fantastic. 
My first impression was damn! The taste doesn't live up to the singing-angels aroma, but hey, what could? Another metric ton of hop variety, grapefruit, rinds, citrus, wrapped in a slick, slippery feel. Surprisingly, there's also a backbone of malt steel here, & the middle of the beer is sticky, syrupy sweet. Wham! The hops come back & that malt is just a warm memory on the tongue. 
The consensus was this was an excellent beer, & there was a marked difference once it warmed - a collection of "yeah, it's OK" changed to "damn, this is good" after 10-15 minutes. Really glad I got to try this one, thanks again Tucker! 1,188 charactersmaximum12, Apr 01, 2011

The growler unleashes a gorgeously bright, brassy body that supports a fluffy, crackling tuft of foam. Sticky lacing coats the insides of the glass. The aroma is tropical, with big notes of pine resin and pale malt in the background. Very assertive nose, and a delight to inhale.
The flavor is unmistakably styled after the West Coast IIPA's, as floral, citrusy, and incredibly piny hop flavors explode upon the palate with each sip. Malts keep up a solid, balancing backbone, however, perhaps a testament to the true East Coast nature of this hop monster. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp, and bright with bitterness. A joy to sip. Definitely a must-try for any hop lover. 737 characterswagenvolks, Mar 30, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The third attempt at getting a growler was the charm, and the best part was I didn't have to give up anything insanely rare, just good beer!
A - Pours a golden color with pillowy white head, great legs.
S - Resinous hops, pine, grapefruit, and light malt backbone.
T - The nose x5. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and all those delicious fruity hop tastes. The malt is there, but sits harmoniously in the background. For the 280 theoretical IBUs this beer is pretty damn tame, or just balanced really well. Alcohol is present but also seems no where near 10.5%.
M/D - Great cabonation from a 6 day old growler that was shipped to Texas, excellent full body as well, with a slightly dry bitter finish. This was an excellent DIPA and according to another at a tasting, is right on par with PtY. 
It'd be awesome if people didn't ransom these growlers because they had to drive 90 minutes... Everything in Texas takes a least that long of a drive unless it's in your city.
I got lucky, but it'd be awesome if more people had a chance to try this beer because it really is an exceptional DIPA. 1,093 charactersxpimptastikx, Mar 29, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Picked up a growler yesterday when we made the 3.5 hour drive up.
A: Pours a pale golden color with a nice frothy head that slowly, slowly dissipates and leaves some solid lacing down the side of my Hill Farmstead glass.
S: The scent is a massive explosion of citrus hops right up front with some sweet malts. Fruity undertones (mangos).
T: The upfront flavor is a huge burst of floral/citrus hops that completely coat the palate. The bitters stick around throughout the drink, well after the beer is gone. The sweet/caramel malts come through in the middle to balance out the bitters nicely. The finish is bitter, very bitter and exceptional.
M: Medium bodied with nice tingly carbonation on the tongue. There is a very bitter feel throughout.
D: Got my first sip of Ephraim at EBF, decided to make the trek up north to get a little more. This beer is everything you need from a IIPA and more. It's incredibly hoppy, yet very well balanced with bits of sweetness from the malts poking through the bitters nicely. This is without a doubt the best East Coast "IIIPA" I've ever had (sorry Heady Topper) and dare I say...better than PtE? I think it might be, but that is up for debate. A must try for any beer connoisseur. 1,224 charactersmavbrew, Mar 27, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Here is the DIPA that rocketed from unknown to superstar at breakneck speed. This has a lot of hype behind it and thus my expectations are appropriately very high. Now for the judgment. Poured into a snifter.
4.0 A: Lightly hazed medium orange color. Two fingers of creamy off-white head. Half the head fell after a short time, but the remainder stuck around for a while. Spotty lacing covers the glass.
4.5 S: Really wonderful aroma! Tons of tropical fruits in this. Pineapple, mango, lots of papaya and orange. Secondarily piney and floral. Fruits combine for a sugary sweetness. Malts are pretty well hidden.
5.0 T: Holy shit is this tasty! I can't believe how wonderful this is. I'm pretty sure a pallet of various tropical fruits had been compressed and molden into the shape of a .50 caliber bullet, then overpacked with powder and shot into my tongue. Pineapple, mango, orange, papaya, and peach are incredibly strong. So fruity, but not too sweet. Malt is easily overshadowed by the hops, but it does well enough to keep the taste balanced. For 280 hypothetical IBUs, the bitterness is quite low and only manifests in the aftertaste. Alcohol is extremely well hidden.
4.5 M: Medium to heavier medium body. Good carbonation, especially for a growler. Very creamy (but could be a bit moreso) and incredibly smooth.
5.0 D: I never thought this would live up to the hype, but instead, it has surpassed it. There isn't a damn thing I would change about this beer. It's about as close as you can get to a perfect taste. Absolutely fabulous. Worth whatever you need to trade for it. 1,588 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 27, 2011

Tastesof hoppy and fruity goodness. Grapefruits And hops abundant! Flighty sweet but the hops still dominate to my delight.

A- Pours a clear, vibrant amber color. Produced two fingers width of white head. Some lacing as beer was consumed. Very pretty to look at.
S- An abundance of tropical fruits and hops. Very juicy, with mango, papaya, and pineapple at the forefront. Just a great hop profile in the nose. I could smell this all day. 
T- I was expecting a hop bomb, but this was more on the balanced side. The tropical aromas are well represented here. Not too much hop bitterness. Very juicy with a bit of a caramel presence in the finish. Restrained, but clean prominent flavors. 
M- Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. Really being picky here, but could of coated the palate a little better.
D- At 10.5% this beer is very dangerous. Alcohol is nearly undetectable and the tropical fruit flavors beg you to come back for more and more.
Overall, an excellent DIPA and one that I am extremely grateful to have tried, much thanks to a very generous BA. This is a very tropical fruit forward DIPA that is nicely balanced. I think it could have used a little more hop bitterness though. Recommended. 1,257 charactersrhinos00, Mar 25, 2011

A - Pours a golden amber, crystal clear as well. A huge fluffy head gradually fills in the extra space in the glass. Retention is good for the amount of alcohol in here, and lacing is on par with some of the best in the style. A visually impressive beer! 
S - After my first smell I'm getting flashbacks to Bell's Hopslam in the fact that there's a ton of citrus and fruit in here. The grapefruit is bitter to a vengeance, taking exception to the IPAs I've quaffed in days past. You can almost smell the hop juice oozing out of this beer. Besides the grapefruit, there's also a good bit of orange and mango in here as well, and perhaps just a bit of alcohol.
T - I take my first sip and I can almost hear my teeth scream and this beer rips the enamel straight off of them as the 280 IBUs cut through my palate. This beer features a cornucopia of citrus, most prominently the grapefruit. This is a big hop bomb, but not in the typical West Coast style. The finish is long and very bitter, with mango the strongest flavor.
M - Mouthfeel is moderately heavy with good carbonation. The hops really do a number on the palate, and its very resiny. The tongue feels a bit heavier after a glass of this.
D - Drinkability is high. This beer is a monster and has a ton of flavor and hops. An incredible offering from a hopefully up and coming brewery! 1,429 charactersnhindian, Mar 25, 2011

S: The hop smell here is huge, pretty daunting. Piney and citrus hops mostly. Not getting a lot of malts or alcohol.
T: I was expecting to be killed by hops on this one, but it really has a nice taste. Citrus hops start it off, and lead into piney hops. A bit of alcohol on the backend. Hardly any malts. More fruity than floral.
MF: Light with a nice amount of carbonation. Pretty bitter, but actually not a lot of alcohol. Very crisp.
O: When I saw it had 280 IBUs I was pretty intimidated, but this is crazy drinkable and very good overall. 707 charactersrusswbeck, Mar 24, 2011

Really looking forward to this as I love a good DIPA and this one was pretty goddamn nice. Pours a nice gold color with great carbonation and nice sizable head leaving some nice lacing.
Lost of citrus comes through in the nose with no real malt to speak of which is ideal. Some alcohol is detected, but not much. 
Taste is rather bright with a lot of citrus and some sweetness. Some peach notes with hints of grapefruit shine through.
Mouthfeel is spot on for the style and I don't think that I would have a problem finishing the entire goddamn growler myself.

3.7/5  rDev -17.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5The second of two growlers I picked up last weekend. 
Poured into a Duvel Tulip and leaves a small off-white head that goes quickly. Lots of bubbles coming up through a light yellow beer. Pretty clear. 
Smells really nice with pine flavored resiny hops up front. Really not much else. A bit of booziness to the smell. 
Taste is lighter than expected. A bit fruity, hops come on strong with mango, papaya and other island tastes. Really no malt to speak of. Booze comes through stong after the third sip but that's to be expected. 
Mouth feel is thin and dry. A bit champagne like. Kind of tingly mouth feel as with most of the HF beers I have tried so far. Not something I love. 
Overall I liked it but not a lot of depth. Hoppy and thin with that signature bite and tingly, numbing feeling. Where is the flavor? Dangerously close to proving that if you dump enough hops into it the geeks will flock to it. 911 charactersCascade77, Mar 23, 2011

The beer appears clear and golden hued. The head is thick, has last retention, and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass.
The aroma is a bouquet of fresh hops and citrus, with a very slight hint of alcohol.
The flavor is bold and fantastic, with the expected hop and citrus coming through beautifully. A truck load of bitterness and fresh hops assault the palate in the best possible way. Alcohol presence gently reveals itself near the finish, but I wouldn't have guessed this was 10.5% abv. Wow, this is incredibly drinkable at that potency. This brew is certainly worthy of attention and praise. I thoroughly enjoyed Ephraim and would relish the opportunity to have it again. 748 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 21, 2011

a - Pours a clear orange color with one inch of white head and light carbonation evident.
s - Smells of grapefruit, citrus hops, sweet fruity malts, tropical fruits, melon, and maybe a hint of pine hops. Lots of hops and different fruits coming out in the smell, it's reall nice.
t - Taste follows the nose; lots of citrus hops, tropical fruits, grapefruit, melon. Also a crazy amount of bitterness up front. I wish it had been slightly less bitter, but it was still very good.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Huge bitter kick up front.
d - A really nice DIPA; one I would certainly try and trade for again. Lots of citrus hops and different fruits in the nose and if you like that bitter taste in DIPA's, you'll love this one. Would like to have again. 961 charactersmdfb79, Mar 21, 2011

Beer is amber, light amber and mostly clear with a wonderful thick head of small and medium bubbles, head has some retention to it too. Some lacing left on the walls of my HF glass, the lacing probably only works in the right glassware.
Aroma is awesome. It is hoppy, like a fruit salad, with mango and peaches and cantaloupe and papaya. Complex, fruity, hoppy, good.
Beer is medium to light in body and really really bitter. This beer likely maxes out the bitterness scale for beer in general but specifically this beer is quite quite bitter. There is very little hint of malt at the lead off and there is an unfolding on flavors on the midpalate with a variety of fruity esters from the hops. The beer has good connectivity and I thoroughly enjoyed two full pours of this beer. A great great great IPA for sure. I could hurt myself with a growler of this beer. 1,065 charactersdrabmuh, Mar 21, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Hazy straw-amber-apricot-peach pour, good head and lacing
Smell: This beer is huge. Enormous, over-the-top load of hops. Pine resin, grapefruit, tropical fruits, papaya. Slightly sweet
Taste: Just enormous in the hop department. It is like they backed a dump truck full of hops and forced it into this growler. Just huge. Tropical fruits, citrus, grapefruit, orange. A bit sweet. Bitterness is perfect, strong and present without being overbearing. That said, I think they dialed it up to 11 and should have stopped at 10.
Mouthfeel: Again, this is a big beer. You don't gulp it. You don't drink it. You sip it, otherwise it will overpower you.
Drinkability/Overall: This is so huge it is hard to consume in quantity, but it does run with the big boy DIPAs. Well done. This thing is a hop grenade, although I prefer the boy king / pliny the younger type ones. 883 characterscraytonic, Mar 20, 2011

A: Gold in color with a 1 finger white head that has pretty good retention and lacing. Typically, I prefer a little more amber in my DIPAs.
S: There's lots of tropical fruits and some citrus on the nose. Mostly I get pear, orange, and strawberry with a little bit of guava and banana. There's some earthiness at the back end.
T: When this one is very cold there's a lot of sweet fruit and citrus flavors, but as it warms it becomes chalkier. Actually it becomes quite chalky as it warms. I would really recommend drinking this as cold as possible, as that is when I think it's at its best. Also, while there are great fruit and some citrus flavors, this beer is slightly sweeter than I like for the style
M: I thought the carbonation and viscosity were appropriate and above average, although I wasn't a big fan of the aftertaste. It was just too chalky at the finish, and not as crisp and clean as I would have liked. Also, while the start of the beer is great, I like a little bit of hop bite at the end, and I feel that this beer doesn't have to much of a bitterness at the finish. In summary, it's a sweet, fruity, pretty good DIPA.
O: Overall, if this was on tap near me I would probably have it frequently. If I had to trade a difficult to come by beer for it, I most likely wouldn't do it. In terms of drinkability, this beer gets a lot of credit for going down easy and masking the 10.5% ABV. 1,530 charactersglazeman, Mar 19, 2011

The appearance is nothing too special - light yellow with a one finger head; pretty clear; reminds me of Sculpin.
Smell is fruity and boozy - mango, grapefruit, and some nutty maltiness in the finish.
Taste is good, but there is a lack of a fresh hop bite. Too sweet and too fruity.
Mouthfeel is sort of chalky and syrupy. Nice, but maybe a little too thick for a DIPA.
Overall, this is a good beer. But no, it does not live up to the hype. 619 charactersairohead2001, Mar 19, 2011

Oh man, the smell! Loved the aroma - in your face hops with plenty of grapefruit, pine, grass, and some tropical notes. Overwhelming amount of hop smell. Mmmmm, I smelled this over and over again.
Taste follows the smell very well. Grass, pine, grapefruit and orange citrus with some honey sweetness. Nice bitter finish. Medium body with great carbonation, even from a growler. Pretty easy to drink for the strength. 
Overall, definitely one of the best double IPAs I've had. Very glad to have gotten to try it. 650 charactersejyoung, Mar 19, 2011

S: Amazing nose. In your face grapefruit and citrus. Piney as well. Never came across in the nose as bitterness. Super crisp and fresh smelling. Just hop cones shoved in your nostrils. One of the best noses ever in a DIPA for me.
T: While not as good as the nose this is damn solid. Super fresh hop taste with a big grapefruit component. I wouldn't call it balanced but there was a ton of malt to even things out. Never was it really bitter except for a touch in the finish. Piney. Touch of orange peel. Tons of complexity out of the hops.
M: Medium body. Good carbonation for a growler. Nice and dry.
D: Right up there with the younger. Insanely drinkable. Would have thought around 8%. The best DIPA that I have had in a long time. 933 charactersaerozeppl, Mar 18, 2011

Growler to an imperial pint glass.
Nice looking copper color. Big giant 3 finger head. Lacing is prevalent. It's like a big beautiful bouquet busting out of the top of my glass. The smell is like a tropical rainforest. Pineapple, mango, melon, and cotton candy. This is seriously intense. I'm waiting for a monkey to come crawling out of my glass. My olfactory nerves are making love to my brain right now. Jeebus I hope this smell translates to taste. And...it does in a big way. Just awesome. You get the sweet citrus almost honey loveliness and then it's cut with dry bitterness. Brilliant. This was waltzing on my tongue. I didn't think it was too sticky but essentially almost perfect. A nice carbonation like you want your dipa to have.
I strive to try beers like this. The trading price was well warranted for this beer. In fact I would do it again over and over. Was it the best I've ever had? I think yes. This unknown is king of the hill in my opinion. Seek it out, you won't be disappointed. 1,047 charactersTheDudeRules, Mar 17, 2011

Appearance: Clear golden pour
Smell: Deep piney hoppy goodness with a touch of orange.
Taste: Resinous piney hop blast. As it warms there is some orange or tangerine. I am sure there is a significant malt bill here but it definitely takes a back seat to the huge hops. Nice dry finish that is a touch bitter but not exceedingly so and it lasts a long long time. Superb.
Mouthfeel; Nice creamy resinous mouthfeel.
Drinkability: Good, would be better at lower ABV but the wife and I had no problem polishing off the growler.
My first Hill Farmstead beer and a great one at that. I can't wait to try more of their hoppy goodness. 722 charactersbrewdan, Mar 13, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks go out to imagineiii for providing this growler as a prize in the fourth Beer Puzzle LIF. It was shared at a tasting of Arizona-bound beer lovers, and my particular pour was put inside a tulip. 
Ephraim was the great-great grandfather of the current Hill Farmstead brewers -- the brewery itself sits just several hundred feet downhill from the land that he settled. Ephraim the beer is unfiltered, naturally carbonated, double dry hopped, brewed with water from Hill Farmstead's own wells, and boasts an impressive hop bill (Centennial, Chinook, Columbus, Simcoe and Warrior) resulting in 280 theoretical IBUs.
Pours a light, perfectly clear tangerine with a head of bubbly, off-white froth that fizzles away quickly. Thin, craggy streaks of lace and very thin silky top layer linger as I drink. 
The nose: super floral, super good. Orange blossom, honey liqueur, grass and melon. It's very boozy, and lots of alcohol burns the nose hairs. Rich.
In the flavor: hops, hops and more hops. Grapefruit juice, orange liqueur, honey, a bit of caramel, rose petals, fresh grass. A striking bitterness grips the tongue mightily. Very alcoholic, and again, rich.
The body is a silky medium, liqueur-like in feel, with a light, massaging carbonation. It retains its creaminess as I move it about. The 10.3 percent ABV is very noticeable in the nose, flavor, and drunkenness it's bestowing upon me.
For how heavy and alcoholic Ephraim is, drinkability is incredible. I can't stop sipping it. A fantastic DIPA. 1,516 charactersPhelps, Mar 13, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Growler brought over by Michael, thanks!
Pours a vibrant clear golden amber with a couple fingers of white head made up of some very thin bubbles. It almost glows when held up to the light. The head soon fades, leaving some bits of lacing in the glass.
The aroma is a very complex mix of pine resin, some citrus grapefuit and orange and some sweet malt in the background. It's almost reminiscent of a honey sweetness. Some alcohol becomes more evident as it warms.
The taste starts off slow up front, but as soon as it hits the middle of the tongue a serious load of citrus and malt sweetness, again almost like honey, hits you and the finish is a heavy bitter does of pine and resins. Although the description says a theoretical 280 IBU's, the bitterness is very well balanced and not as overpowering as the number would suggest.
The mouthfeel is really nice, but just a touch thin and not quite as "sticky" as I would expect from something this heavily hopped and 10.5%. Carbonation is thin and prickly and really spot on. This one goes down way too easy and I can only wish that something half this good was on tap locally. 1,130 characters321jeff, Mar 09, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to John for sending me a growler of the most recent batch from early March 2011.
A: clear orangish yellow, lots of bubbles with off white 2 finger head.
S: lots of tropical fruits, hops, tangerines, grapefruits, sweet honesuckle. Perfect
T: didnt quite live up to the aroma. I expected more of a tropical fruit flavor that followed that wonderful aroma. However still very drinkable and it reminded me alot of Pliney the Elder. However I still wish it was a bit more tropical sweet in the flavor instead of heavier on the grapefruit/pine. 
M: medium to almost heavy body (towards the end of the swig). Lots of carbonation, but they danced off the tongue.
D: I would have given it a 4.5-5.0 on this one had the taste been a bit more tropical, and at the very end of the swig, I felt this beer had a tinge of aspirin flavor to it. It appeared about 3 seconds after swallowing the beer. It was weird, but detracted a bit from the enjoyment. 
However, I must say that this is an EXCELLENT beer and with beers like this and Double Sunshine from Lawson's...looks like Vermont is fast becoming the new "San Diego" and its a pleasure to know that FINALLY the east coasters are understanding how to make a proper hop-forward IPA/DIPA. Keep em coming... 1,252 charactersSolomon420, Mar 07, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to Todd for hooking me up with a growler of this. So far I've been a big fan of Shaun's IPAs, so I've been looking forward to trying this one.
A: The pour is surprisingly clear, and is a nice golden amber color with a couple fingers of white head and sticky lacing all down the glass.
S: Intensely fruity on the nose. Excellent grapefruit, but perhaps even better tropical fruit aromas. Lots of pineapple and mango, perhaps some grass and certainly a little bit of pine. A mild sugar aroma provides some additional sweetness.
T: There is a touch of sweet malt flavor, but after that, it's just a ton of fruity hops. Pineapple, mango, and peaches give the beer a really nice flavor and the grapefruit and pine notes provide the requisite bitterness.
M: Medium in body with a moderate level of carbonation. Not super bitter on the finish.
D: Damn good stuff, but the alcohol does catch up with you on this one. Deceptively easy to drink. 952 characterswomencantsail, Mar 07, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to Andrewinski1 for making the trek down to Hill Farmstead to grab this one up. Dedication. Poured into a tulip. Beer pours a slightly hazy straw color with about a finger of white fluffy head. It retains nicely and eventually settles down a bit leaving thin soapy lace. 
Perfect balance on the aroma for this one. Bitter pine hops are really in your face on this one. The hop aroma blends itself nicely with a candied blood orange aroma that give a nice touch of sweetness in the aroma.
It's official. This is a hop bomb. Right away tropical juice flavors take over my pallet. Pineapple juice and orange flavors to start it off. If finishes with a really piney hop flavor. 
A little bit of a sticky feel to this but the body is still pretty good. Lively carbonation, so it held up nicely in the growler. Overall, this is amazing. Drinkable to no end. 10.5? Like hell. Drinks like it's half that. 911 charactersBendurgin, Mar 07, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured into a Hill Farmstead Glass. The color is a nice orangey gold color. A small white head is formed and leaves super sticky lacing.
The aroma is full of sweet tropical fruit like mango and a touch of orange zest. Smells juicy.
The taste is heavy on pineapple and also has some nice sweet orange in the finish as well. There is a touch of pine needle in there as well, but this is much more overwhelming with pineapple flavor. The sweetness is just enough to offset the bitterness. A great balance as far as a "triple" IPA is concerned.
The carbonation is nice and crisp, the body is relatively light, but still thick enough to fill your mouth with juicy hop nectar.
This is very very drinkable. I can't wait for every sip. Glad I'm only splitting this 3 ways so I can have a bunch. The more I drink, the more I get heavy pine, and it's awesome. 853 charactersandrewinski1, Mar 07, 2011

Growler opened with a large -pop- and was served in my Ithaca tulip.
The beer looks great. Nice closing yellowy gold... Slightly hazy, which I am a fan of... Big 3 fingers of white head... Very sticky lacing and strong retention. Off to a very strong start. 
Smells good. Big citrus and pine hop notes. No real malt. Crisp and clean. The taste has some citrus and pine for sure... But everything is almost lost to a hurricane of pure bitterness. This is painfully bitter, but at the cost of a lot of flavor. This reminds me of Ruination a bit... 
The body is oily and light-- almost thin for my tastes. Almost watery?! Wow. There is no bright prickliness that really helps propel the flavor across each tastebud... The beer feels dull and boring. Lots of oily residue left after each sip. It coats my teeth with pine tar.
Overall... This is a good beer. Is it fantastic? Meh. Is it world class? Nope. 
It is a sign of a good young brewery though, and I'd love to see what these guys can do after tweaking things a bit. 1,127 charactersAleWatcher, Mar 06, 2011

A: Clear Orange to yellowish color with epic lacing and small bubbly head. Nice carbonation from the growler, which I was pleased to see. I expected the color to be brighter than normal IPA's since I saw there was so little malt.
S: Dank Hops, hop resin and sugary malt. Huge citrus notes and bitterness in there, wow. 
T: Really crazy concentrated hops at the back of the palate with a huge bitter note and soft sugary feel up front. Grass, citrus, pine its all there in a huge hammer at the back of the palate. It's very nice how the beer has such a nice ease to it at the front of the palate and then really slams you with a multitude of hop flavors that I really dig. This is not the most balanced beer, but it is a dream for hop lovers and bitter loving people!
M: As I said, sugar up front and huge bitter back, maybe the most bitter palate wrecker I've had. Medium feel, not too much heat actually. 
D: Great huge IPA, but it definitely taxes your palate fast! Excellent beer, I hope to get more of their stuff. 1,097 charactersDreadnaught33, Mar 06, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to dreadnaught33 for sharing some of his growler last night.
I have to say, the only thing about this beer that was not immensely impressive was the way it looked - a bit of a thin yellowish orange without a ton of head. Everything else about this beer was exceptional. The smell just hit me in the face with that big, aromatic hop and citrus aroma that I love in a DIPA, and the taste definitely followed suit. It was hoppy, fruity, a little sweet and ridiculously smooth, basically a perfect DIPA. It was so easy to drink that I was shocked to see that the ABV was 10.5%. 
Overall, this is one of the best DIPAs I have ever had and a beer definitely deserving of all of the hype it's getting. It's pretty much perfect in every way.
Edit: I had some from the recent batch and it just wasn't quite as good. It was still a hell of DIPA, but it was more resiny and sweeter and a lot less bitter. I just didn't think the flavors came together quite as well the 2nd time around, so I'm making some minor changes to the review. 1,037 charactersstarrdogg, Mar 04, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Finished writing an appellate brief from hell tonight, so thought I would reward myself with a couple of glasses of Ephraim. From a growler sent by a generous BA. Opened on 03.03.2011.
Pours a glowing orange peel orange with a full, thick-lacing-leaving head. A patch of thick bubbles sits idly on a quarter of the surface area.
Tropical fruit hits the nose, emanating bright orange and citrus, peach, mango and papaya. There's some resinous pine on the end of the nose, but it fades quickly into the light caramel malt backbone. As it opens, I get more caramelized sugar sweetness running through this. 
Surprisingly (why am I surprised) bitter. It opens with the featured tropical fruitiness, but quickly transforms into a punch of pine and grapefruit pith. You can almost feel it tingle on your tongue. I get a nice dose of citric sweetness mid-palate that is washed away by the pithy and resinous bitterness. Sharply bitter finish. 
Medium-bodied, somewhat dry mid-to-late palate. Sticky. Medium to medium-low carbonation. There's some heat on it.
This tests my personal limits for bitterness, as I've never experienced anything quite like the finish here - it's assaulting. Still, surprisingly complex - the hints of orange that peek through are bright and brilliant - and my first glass is empty before the review is done. A DIPA to be reckoned with. 1,361 charactersVerecund, Mar 04, 2011

On tap and in growlers.
It pours a hazy yellow with a medium creamy head that holds nicely and laces in the glass. Big hop aroma with notes of citrus and pine. The taste is slightly resinous, citrusy and fruity, but smooth and no alcohol hotness at all. It finishes with a balanced bitterness and slight dryness that begs for a repour.
Really fresh taste overall and one of the few Imperial IPAs I can enjoy more than one of in a sitting. 566 charactersGatheringBrews, Jan 06, 2011

Had this very fresh at EBF. The characteristics are similar to what is described below, but everything was so much more pungent. The nose absolutely exploded with raw hops that carried through to over-the-top hops in the flavor along with a really nice amount of bitterness for a seriously drinkable brew.
Old Review: 4 / 4.5 / 4 / 4.5 / 4
On tap at the Three Penny Taproom. Super-friendly staff and I'm really glad that this was still on we Amyliz4 and I made it in.
Pours a really bright orange color with two fingers of white head and a load of sticky lacing around the edges of the glass. The nose is really nice and over-the-top hoppy with a lot of pine, resin, orange peel, citrus, and some light tropical fruits. 
The taste has many of the same components of the nose, though those are often overshadowed by the absolutely bruising bitterness that comes through in the mouthfeel. Citrus, tropical fruits, and a bit of pine. The feel is really, really hoppy and mixes well with the light alcohol that comes through. I'd love to try this again and will hopefully be making a trip back up North to visit all these magnificent Vermont breweries at some point soon. 1,203 charactersThorpe429, Nov 14, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap at the Farmhouse. Poured into a goblet tasting glass, hazy deep amber-gold body under a lacy white head. The hop smell wafts across the table: sweet, sappy, grassy and with a heavy dose of floral honey. Fresh and mouthwatering IPA smells.
Tastes just less potent than I remember, but with a huge grapefruit presence that dominates the bitter profile and an appealing slight sweetness under the hop backbone. Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy but drying and smooth, medium-bodied. For how bitter this beer is, it's extremely well-balanced and very, very drinkable. Delicious!!
I hope to have this on tap fresh if it comes out again. Definitely an experience to look forward to. 684 charactersabuliarose, Nov 07, 2010

Thick chewy hops interplay with cookie dough pale malts. Medium bodied. Carbonation spot (esp for a growler I've been sitting on for a few weeks). Booze is not apparent other then a warming heat as this hop delivery vehicle slides down the throat. Its a man among boys in the world of dipas. Drinkability is insance for the power of this brew.

4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at the Farmhouse Tap and Grill. Served in a small tasting glass. A thin white head sits on top of a beautiful glowing orange body. Lots of sticky lacing left behind.
Wedges of orange citrus mixed with pine-laden hop hit the nose. Some sweet malt makes its way in as well. Definitely more balanced this time around than at the release. More citrus notes, but the grassy-pine hop aroma is still nice and strong.
Hoppy, bitter, crushed orange and sweet malts wash across the tongue. Sticky pine, slightly grassy and full of citrus. A great IBU punch to the mouth, but still maintaining great balance. This is how a DIPA should taste.
Mouthfeel is sticky, resiny, smooth and bitter. Good carbonation and a body that is substantial, yet light enough to be refreshing.
As always, this is ridiculously easy to drink. A delicious Double/Triple IPA that has a huge helping of hops, but plenty of citrus and body that make it a pleasure to drink. The ABV is unnoticeable, so this brew is dangerous in more ways than one. I highly recommend seeking this one out. It is simply one of the best hop-infused beers out there. 1,120 characterssisuspeed, Nov 03, 2010

Great pine/citrus (grapefruit) smell. The best smelling east coast IPA I have ever had. The taste did not dissapoint. More hoppy than malty (which I like.) Mouthfeel was also excellent. Perfectly carbonated. 
All things being equal, I would pick this over any other DIPA I have ever consumed. This one is nothing short of perfection. 446 charactersmymrnngjckt, Oct 27, 2010

Pours a golden yellow amber color with a very white head that forms a nice 1 finger head of foam that false rather quickly. I can smell the hop aroma as I pour this out into the glass. Very aromatic with nice tropical type hop notes like pineapple and mango, also some citrus rind. Medium mouthfeel. Fruity malty sweetness gives way to a nice bitter hop bite. Wow, bitter bite, might be a tad much. Very slight alcohol notes but otherwise the alcohol is fairly well hidden. 482 characterskbutler1, Oct 27, 2010

Poured into Bells snifter.
Pours 1 finger of white head that fades to a thick ring. Leaves some lacing from there. Color is a clear golden orange. 
Aroma: Hmm, this smells far better than any east cost XPA I have smelt. Reminds me more of west coast style. Huge pine hop profile with a large amount of citrus. Has a lot of mangoes and grapefruit flavors with a bit of orange. I get a touch of onion, but it is very faint. 
Taste: Very hoppy. Floral and pine round this one out with a touch of alcohol. It also has a heavy dose of grapefruit, orange, and mango, much like the nose. There is a touch of bready malts and an light union flavor.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. A little boozy. Pretty bitter. Ends clean with a little heat left over.
Overall, this is a great dipa. Either I am very thirsty or this thing is that drinkable, because my glass isn't lasting long. I am glad I have finally had a DIPA from the east coast that has impressed me. 1,025 charactersmothman, Oct 27, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks! A much anticipated first review from a much anticipated brewery. I'm new to Hill Farmstead brewery, but not to the beers of this brewer.
A: Appears tangerine orange and clear with a billowing white head, great retention, and thick sheets of lacing.
S: Aroma is of grapefruit, peach, tangerine, mango, orange, passion fruit, and a little papaya, a veritable cornucopia of fruit characteristics that coexist harmoniously. Holy shit this smells fantastic. There's a whisper of pine in there as well, but the hop character is mostly fruit. Alcohol is very well hidden for the monstrous ABV, I can't even detect it. Malt is light and reminiscent of caramel. One of the best smelling Double/Triple IPAs I've encountered.
T: Big hop flavor, manifesting itself in the form of a myriad of fruits: peach, mango, orange, grapefruit, papaya, and tangerine. Bitterness is at an upper moderate level with ephemeral sweetness midpalate. Malt is caramel in character but takes a backseat to the bold and unabashed hop profile. This is _outstanding_ stuff. Finish is a hop explosion with a lingering pithy bitterness. Alcohol is deftly masked.
M: Medium bodied with a dry, sticky mouthfeel and good carbonation. The growler held up very well.
Overall: Top notch stuff. This is one of the best Double/Triple IPAs I've had, up there with Younger. If future batches are as good as this first batch this beer will become very well known. Seek this out! 1,444 charactersHopHead84, Oct 20, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had a few pours from a growler thanks to Arbitrator. The growler apparently lost a few ounces of beer in transit, but that didn't seem to harm it much beyond a slight loss of carbonation.
It pours a hazy glowing peach color, capped by a finger of white froth that takes a moment to form and then slowly settles to a collar.
I was taken aback by the huge hop aroma. Tangerine, pineapple and grapefruit instantly remind me of Pliny the Younger, my gold standard for the style, but there's also a resiny/evergreen-like quality to it. There's a lightly sweet sugary (though not overtly caramelized) malt backbone, just enough sweetness to give a beer this big some substance.
Hop flavors hit the tongue first, and mirror the aroma with notes of pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, perhaps a touch more juicy tropical fruit. It has a substantial malt character, but I only pick up a hint of sweetness before my palate is annihilated by the hugely bitter finish. The mouthfeel might be my favorite aspect of the beer, it's sharp and resiny, extremely bitter but not necessarily harsh. Truly outstanding stuff, and surprisingly easy to drink for a 10.5% monster. I hope this becomes a somewhat regular release. 1,204 characterslargadeer, Oct 20, 2010

Pours a great bright golden color with a small white head that fades.
Big-time citrusy and herbal hop aroma with sweet malt to back it up. Really enticing.
The flavor is very nice and hop-forward. Sweet and caramel malt base, with huge grapefruity, orangey, pine, herbal notes, and big resin.
Enamel-ripping mouthfeel with fairly lively carbonation despite being from a growler. Medium-full body.
Really awesome DIPA, almost up to Younger level. So easy to drink at 10.5%. Man, never thought I'd become a Vermont hyper, but here I go. Do they put hallucinogens in these beers? 736 charactersnickd717, Oct 16, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Chilled growler into a glass. Thanks Kristin!
A: Pours a hazy golden peach body with not a ton of head. The growler has been in transit for a week and it was apparently filled right to the top; the paper towel wrapped around the neck showed that it might have leaked in transit, so I'm forgiving any carbonation issues in appearance or mouthfeel. This special is today only! Anyway, the foam is lightly beige in color; it slowly comes out of solution, then vanishes very quickly. Some spotty lace left behind. 
S: Carbonation issues or no, it is not affecting the aroma at all. A nice, pungent blend of orange rind, candied grapefruit, pineapple, passionfruit, and a touch of mossy weed (I wrote this down as 'dank' to widespread mockery by the tasting group, but I stand by it). There's an expressive sugariness and booze. 
T: Initially the taste is a rough bitterness. I'm unused to this, considering that I mostly drink West Coast IPAs with a lot of hop flavor but not necessarily a lot of hop bitterness. But the flavors come together pretty nicely: orange rind, passionfruit, pineapple. Grapefruit and substantial sugar cookie give the impression of candied grapefruit. The mossy, weedy flavors are particularly noticeable here; they pull into the finish with a sticky, resinous presence. This reminds me heavily of fresh Moylan's Hopsickle. 
M: Full, expressive flavors abound. There's a touch of booze that I don't enjoy, but having had a 3-week old growler of Pliny the Younger that was boozier than the tap version, I'm attributing this change to the serving format. It's also low in carbonation, but again, I'm forgiving it. It has an enamel-peeling bitterness and stickiness that made it hard to taste anything afterward. I was a little stupid in opening it so early in the night. 
D: I still find that Pliny the Younger takes the cake when you're talking about triple IPAs. I prefer the sweeter presence of that beer to the bitterness of this one. But I've also had the former under optimal serving conditions, and this one less so; I wouldn't be surprised if that makes a difference. This is a great beer. I'd love to have it again. But given most of the trade demands for it, I'd probably get some fresh Hopsickle on tap, instead... 2,251 charactersArbitrator, Oct 16, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a nice caramel orange with a light white head of tiny bubbles. Smell of grapefruit citrus, caramel, sugar, cotton candy and well rounded as the sweetness and bitterness seem to equal each other. 
Taste of delicious citrus. Possibly the strongest citrus I have had in an Imperial IPA. When drinking it, I could imagine biting into a fresh orange and having similar tastes. Sweet sticky sugar with nice caramelized flavors of pine, citrus and grapefruit with a great thick body. There is a very light carbonation to this coming out of a freshly tapped keg poured earlier in the day. The flavors all come together so smoothly that it is hard to imagine this being a 10.5% beer. In one sip you may find the sweetness coming out where the next you will be thinking about how bitter it is. Both complement each other to the point I could not determine which was more prevalent. Very well done and a treat to have. 915 charactersalpinebryant, Oct 16, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Jason for procuring a growler of this highly regarded brew. Served in a Rodenbach tulip.
A - Not much hiss from the growler, which was literally filled to the brim. A hard pour yields a finger of big-bubbled orange-tinged foam that dissipates to a chunky ring, leaving behind spotty lace. Subsequent pours were normal, with a more smooth and creamy appearance to the foam. The body is a pleasant lightly hazed golden peach color.
S - Huge citrus rind and zest, light dank and catty notes, candied citrus and touch of tropical fruits, burnt sugary malt and a touch of alcohol. There's also a sugar character that reminds me of the Flossmoor beers that contain Jaggery - a quick trip to Ratebeer confirms the addition of dextrose.
T - This was the hardest category for me to evaluate. Around mid-palate the beer really takes off, with intense citrus and bruising bitterness in the finish that lingers well into the aftertaste. It's just the initial flavor seems a big unfocused and flaccid. If I could, this would probably get a 4.25, but I'm going to round up as I was a little hard on the appearance of a beer from a week-old growler sent by mail.
M - Body is big, thick, and juicy, but offset with some low carbonation tingle. There's a bit of warmth, but not an offensive amount by any stretch. Super enamel-melting and resiny residual feel.
D - I really liked this, even with the alcohol and bitterness mounting quickly after the first glass. Still, I couldn't keep myself from returning to the growler throughout the evening. I know this is supposed to be a "triple" IPA, but I prefer more medium and punchy DIPAs that have a bit less sugar character. Still this was a very enjoyable brew and I'd gladly have it again. 1,737 charactersMasterSki, Oct 14, 2010

A - An opaque orangish amber with a late rising head that had decent retention. Nice stick on the sides with some very fine lace. 
S - Smells very light, an interesting citrusy flavor, smells something like a tropical fruit that I just can't place. Burnt sugar, and a nice malt backbone. 
T - A nicely light drinking triple IPA. Citrusy hops, you can definately pick up on the added sugar in this one. The bittering hops in this is quite suble but picks up steam on the end and gives you a nice bite that really gets you. An interesting fruity taste that is also like the smell that I can't place. Alcohol is quite well hidden, only burn comes with the sugar at the end. 
M - Lighter side of medium body with moderate carbonation. Good feel for this beer. 
D - Very drinkable triple ipa, alchohol quite well hidden, a little sweet that keeps it at a 4. 907 charactersAgentZero, Oct 14, 2010

This batch is more hot, way too much alcohol on the finish. Still pretty good, just not the epic level of the first batch, still recommend trying. 
Growler provided by sleepydave, drank into my Narke tulip...The top pops without an whiff and I'm a bit concerned, then I see theres only about a half centimeter of air, so I'm good. Pours a dark peach, nice color. At first it pours without any head, then as it settles about a full finger of light tope head. Pretty good retention, but really nice lacing; thin drops around the glass but super sticky...The aroma is not at as strong as expected, but in a good way; doesn't overpower. Very light grapefruit on the front, light sugar, and sweet pine hops. The backbone is light pine and alcohol but exactly what you are looking, makes me really want to drink it...The taste is a super nice perfect combination of sweet and bitter. The sweetness doesn't really show as fruits, but sugar and alcohol. The finish is hoppy, gives you want you want but not at all harsh or so much hops it distracts you from drinking. The finish is pine resin, sugar, alcohol and a little metal....The feel is outstanding. Sticks to your palate start to finish, its full, coating, makes you lick your lips, a smooth and lasting finish...Incredibly drinkable.
Another beer that was crazily hyped but actually lived up to expectations. Would LOVE to try this fresh. 1,485 charactersjrallen34, Oct 14, 2010

A - Pours a clear orangish/yellow, white head that dissipates to a thin film, very sticky lacing all along the sides of the glass, and a thin ring around the glass. 
S - Sweet burnt sugars, lots of malts, bitter citrus notes, dankness. Pretty damn solid combo of stuff going on here. 
T - Sweet malts and sugars up front followed by an onslaught of bitter hoppy dankness. It's a transition from one to another, but holy shit, the hops are beating my palate into submission.

Smell was very fresh and floral, with big citrus and pine aromas in particular. Very fruity, with grapefruit and sweeter tangerine aromas, plus the resiny pine. Really nice.
Taste really showcased some nice hop flavor without overwhelming the palate with bitterness. Citrus and pine were the dominant characteristics again, with some orange sweetness and more bitter, pithy grapefruit flavor as well. The bitterness was substantial, however, and I found that by the time I was done with a second glass it seemed much more bitter than when I started. Malt flavor was pretty minimal, some pale malt sweetness was all. A hop showcase for sure.
Mouthfeel was maybe not as creamy as you'd expect at this level of hoppiness, but was still quite smooth and clean in the finish. I did get a quick shot of alcohol burn at one point, as well.
Glad I got to try this as it's a really good DIPA. Tons of hop flavor with a sneaky, mounting bitterness that takes its toll on the palate before you realize it. So much flavor that it goes down awfully easy, however. One of the best DIPAs on the East Coast for sure. 1,271 charactersnumber1bum, Oct 11, 2010
3.92/5  rDev -12.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Drank on-tap at the Blackback Pub & Flyshop, Waterbury, VT
Served in a cervoise
A creamy, light tan, one-finger cap of froth topped the hazy, amber liquid. As the beer sat, the head dissipated to a thin film and the body turned nearly transparent.
Loads of candied grapefruit peel came through in the aroma. Super dank and hoppy. Citrusy and rather sweet. Some brown sugar notes were apparent.
The taste started out fairly balanced but soon turned overwhelmingly hoppy and bitter. Pithy, dry, grapefruit peel dominated the flavor profile. Oily and resinous. Orange notes came through as well. The finish was outrageously piney, dry and bitter.
The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with a fine, moderate effervescence. For a beer of this magnitude, however, I was hoping for a slightly bigger body.
Drinkability certainly was not this beer's strong point. It was so dry and bitter that I actually had a bit of difficulty putting down all twelve ounces.
Ephraim calls itself a "triple IPA" and it certainly lives up to its classification. If you prefer your IPAs abrasively hoppy and bitter, then you would likely enjoy this beer. 1,133 charactersDamian, Oct 11, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoying this brew with some friends to celebrate finishing up my first marathon. Courtesy of mymrrngjckt who received this from the brewer, I'm looking forward to trying this.
Appearance: Poured from a cool looking growler, the beer is a cloudy, rich honey color. Not a lot of head on this one, but I'll attribute that to being in a growler. The thin ring of head around the edge of the beer does leave behind some thick soapy lacing as I swirl it in the glass. Looks good so far...
Smell: Without a doubt, this is the best smelling, hoppy beer that I have ever smelled. Huge bitter citrusy hops without any of that pesky malt getting in the way.
Taste: A fantastic tasting, delightfully hoppy beer! Despite the lack of malt in the nose, there's actually a bit of malty sweetness to at least attempt some balance, but there's no countering the huge about of hops in this brew. Simply put, Pliney has bet it's match. Bitter grapefruit, and just downright awesome.
Mouthfeel: A little lacking in carbonation, but again I have to attribute that to being from a growler. The brew is full bodied and has an interesting sort of hoppy, oily sort of quality to it. Potent for sure.
Drinkability: I love this beer. Loaded with hops, and even though it's got a relatively high ABV you don't realize it while your drinking it. If you are a hop head, you need to try this beer. Highly recommend. 1,389 characterskrisandajt, Oct 11, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Was able to make it up to the Hill Farmstead release on sat last week and couldn't be more pleased with this find! Triple IPA...yes please! 
Clouded orange-amber color with a decent white lacy head. 
this thing smells like it going to be a bomb, piney hops and juiced citrusy fruits forward- 
First taste is smooth upfront, then mid to back tongue the hops kick in. Hops leave your mouth with dry herbal piney stink- fairly bitter and resinous citric hop notes really lingering around with this one.
Finish is still lingering bitter hop resin... delicious!
Seems is was produced in Vermont-afornia by its style. MY favorite style IPA- american and intense! Hope this wont be the last time I get to have this great IIIPA 719 charactersjammalamma, Oct 07, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this in tap at their autumn festival and thought it was too hoppy for me. Got to sit down with it again a few days later and now I can see what the big deal is about. 
Pours the color of a refined honey. It glistens and sparkles in the glass. HUGE layers of dank herbal hops, piney grapefruit and candied hops greet your nose. Smooth sweet hoppy taste. Just layer upon layer of a brutal hop assault. The big alcohol burns this mammoth into your tongue. The only hop I could clearly make out was Simcoe. I'm also getting some mango and passion fruit. There's just an insanely complex hop profile in this beer. With all that is going on, it is incredibly drinkable for a beer of this caliber. 695 charactersBearsOnAcid, Oct 06, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sampled this at the Autumn Harvest Festival. Now, it's time to review it.
Pours a mild blonde color with a one-finger head into my pint glass. It meets the colors.
Grapefruit encircles the olfactory nerves, followed by a slight hint of mint. Malt is sweet and toned down.
The taste? Grapefruit and apricot flavors from the hops mingle with sweet malt. As this elixir unfolds on the tongue, a slight hint of pineapple greets the taste buds. 
Mouthfeel can only be described as full of lingering bitterness, especially pineapple.There's some malt underneath.
Obviously, this is all about the hops. It's beautiful, well-crafted and somewhat too drinkable for the amount of alcohol contained within. Top 10? For sure. Top 5 for Vermont? Heady Topper has some competition! 772 charactersBrad007, Oct 06, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Consumed numerous glasses of this at the Hill Farmstead Autumn Fest on Oct. 2nd.
Beautiful burnished gold with slight orange tinge. Moderate carbonation. Sticky lace is left on my tulip glass after each sip.
An explosion of citrus and pine on first nosing - tangerine, ruby red grapefruit, mango and orange zest. 
Taste followed the nose with just enough malt to backup the hop assault on the palate. Certainly more of a West Coast IPA hop forward brew showcasing various hop varieties in all their glory.
Mouthfeel is near perfect and this beer finishes dry begging you to take another sip making the drinkability through the roof.
Get this if you can!! 659 charactersRochefort10nh, Oct 06, 2010
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours goldfish orange with honey folds. The crown is 1 finger deep, white in color, displays moderate retention and good lace.
Smell: Dank pine/resinous hops, grapefruit, pineapple, a hint of grass and hay, plus a touch of caramel malt.
Taste: Everything in the smell but magnified! 
Mouthfeel: Medium body, juicy, the slightest bit chewy, with moderate carbonation and a nice hop bite in the finish.
Drinkability: Very high despite the IBU's and ABV. It has a serious kick though and gets an alcohol / slight ethanol note as it warms.
One of my new favorites of the style. Home Run Hill Farmstead! I had heard rumors of this one being over 200 ibu's (I heard 230 to be exact) and while I'm not sure upon tasting, it is defintely more on the bitter side than fruity side. 788 characterskoopa, Oct 05, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Served at the autumn fest in Greensboro. Wine glass.
Appearance medium golden color, not cloudy at all.
Great lacing all around.
Smell was floral and wide,no big alcohol nose to it, lots going on.
Taste was even handed for a huge (3X)IPA, the most striking part IMO. Lots of hop profile while not to overwhelming pucker.
Mouthfeel was not to oily but fabulously complex for such a big IPA.
Drinkability, well that is a slippery slope, at 10+ ABV it should not be taken lightly. 
Easily in the top tiers of IPA and yes, I know that is big talk for a big beer.
Well done Shaun

4.74/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52l pop-top growler poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass.
Pours a nice slightly hazy orange with very little head (growler is 48 hours old and has been in a fridge the whole time), looks like some light bubbles and carbonation up the side. Nose is amazing! fresh grapefruit and citrus, mango and orange, very fresh and effervescent.
This is criminally good. So fruity and fresh, it's one of the all time greats of the IPA/IIPA world. It's got that east coast sweetness (think 90 min IPA) but it's got such a fresh floral, piney and bitter hop profile that's it's very west-coast oriented as well. Even 2 days old the carbonation has held up very well, although I'll say it's gone down a bit (as to be expected) from the draft version I had the other day. That being said it's still got a nice light carbonation level (which I know many of my fellow BAs appreciate) which makes it damn easy drinking. 
There is a slight alcohol bite here, but at over 10% that's no surprise. Event still, I hardly notice it in the mouth - I get more of a warming sensation down my throat into the stomach.
I thought this was damn good fresh at the brewery, but I'll be honest I was a bit overwhelmed at the time with the excitement of getting up to Hill Farmstead for the first time, getting to meet Shaun, see some buddies, and get to try all this new & crazy beer that although I really enjoyed it there, I didn't appreciate it as much as I do now at home slowly sipping it. I saw another reviewer who said PtY and Heady Topper have nothing on this, I can't speak for PtY (yet) but this is in my opinion of the same caliber of Heady Topper & Hopzilla (two of my all time favorite beers). 
Keep up the great work Shaun! 1,709 characterskingcrowing, Oct 04, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the brewery release today. Poured into a HF wine glass.
I'll start off by saying this is my favorite IIPA now.
Quick notes from my phone:
Crystal clear golden orange with HUGE creamy off-white head. Nose is barn-yardy, but not with funk, just hay and leather. Lots of angry citrus and bitter foliage.
Palate is obliteratingly bitter! Big orange, lime, bitter lemon, yellow grapefruit and lots of citrus rind. Good whack of residual sugar in the center helps support the MASSIVE amount of hop character/bitterness.
Finish is gripping and destructive! 563 charactersSFLpunk, Oct 03, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Dark orange with a thin off white head.
Aroma: The aroma of this is very strong, with a powerful citrus and apricot kick. Just a lot of fruity and sweet essences here. Some pine comes through, but most of the scent is dominated by sweet fruity flavors. 
Taste: There are notes of citrus and pine flavors which help to balance the overall effect of this beer. Apricot flavor is noticeable, orange and orange rind come through, but the biggest flavor here would be the grapefruit. Some maltiness too, along with a lot of hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Proper amount of carbonation, the high abv is noticeable. 
Drinkability: Drinkeable but boozy. 656 charactersPentastar, Sep 29, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I sampled this on tap at the brewery on 9/24/10 and knew that I immediately needed to grab a growler. 2 liter "genie" shaped swing-top growler into an oversized tulip glass. 
Initially pouring hazy, this clears out nicely into a golden apricot color, topped with a rich foamy head that quickly settles down into a tight finger. This retains with a frothy ¼ finger or so which throws a robust spotty cascade of sticky lacing up on the sides of the glass. Really nice look here once this clears up. The aroma literally smells like a hop grenade went off in your nose. Grapefruit and pine cut through the nostrils like a knife, tempered on the edges by juicy tropical fruit notes (pineapple is especially strong) and sweet sugars from the malt. This is all wrapped up in a blanket of floral, herbal, dank, and spicy tones. This is just so fresh and powerful in the nose; I could literally just sit here and sniff this all night long. 
The hop flavors in the taste are just unbelievably fresh and bright feeling, with a blast of bitter grapefruit and resins that stick in the mouth. The balance here is just impeccable though, with the sugary sweetness of the citrus and malts swooping in off the side to do their thing, leaving the fullness of the hop flavors behind but without a completely overly bitter bite up front either. The bitterness does come out to play big time in the backend though, with citrus rind, spice, and pine, all just smashing the finish of this and leaving back a resinous and dry feel that hammers the tongue and roof of the mouth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied in the mouth at first, with a combo of sharpness and smooth slickness from the hop oils, but the alcohol definitely adds some fuller feeling heft to this as well. Warmth hangs on the breath after each sip and gets a little borderline hot at times, especially when paired up with that intense dry-hopped finish. 
With full and brilliant hop flavors, awesome balance, and an excellent drinkibility for a nearly 11% Triple IPA, it's hard to not want to compare this (and quite favorably I might add) to a certain similar beer out on the West Coast. The only drawback I could possibly find here is that there is maybe a little too much warmth coming out of the body at times but it's hard not to argue that the hop profiles here are just world class. I had the opportunity to try about five different hoppy offerings while visiting the brewery and to say that they've got a handle on these styles would be an understatement. Just awesome stuff here! 2,534 charactersKegatron, Sep 28, 2010
