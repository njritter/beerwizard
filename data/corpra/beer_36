4.84/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Pours a hazy orange with an almost white foam.
The flavor profile is a lot like it's sibling, Sip of Sunshine. Lots of citrus, pineapple and maybe a bit of papaya. Double Sunshine, however, starts out a bit sweeter and finishes with just a bit of an alcohol kick. Definitely more complex than its more readily available brother.
I'm not sure I prefer this beer to SoS, but it's definitely one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking.
Btw, thanks Joe for the chance to try this brew. 496 charactersSteelPenguin, Sep 05, 2016

L - Clear dark orange with two fingers of white head
S - Oddly sweet with butterscotch and caramel. Barely any earthy hops. Malt-dominant.
T - Really weird buttery taste. It's almost like an old Heath bar with butterscotch and toffee notes. Some faint hints of grassy hops and some wet pine tree. So odd.
F - At least the body is full, but those flavors linger. Drinkability is scarce.
O - I recall having this beer two years ago on a trip to VT and it was a citrus explosion and one of the best IPA's VT had to offer in a state full of world class breweries. I honestly do not know what has gone wrong with this beer. Is it a bad batch? Did the recipe change? I wish I could have done a full review of the beer I loved in 2014, but today, this is just plain bad. Sorry. 818 charactersThrewRedButter, Apr 23, 2016

Had it along side a couple other lawson's IPAs, and it was a bit of a let down. I thought SOS had much more hop presence
I did love the heavy malt back bone, but again it didn't have near the hop presence I wanted it to for a big Vermont IPA. I think this one might be a member of the hype train or perhaps it had been sitting around to long leading up the the release at the anniversary party. 434 charactersStoutFox, Apr 19, 2016

L: Like the finest St. Gaudens double-eagle, a deep hazy gold. 2F+ head on pour, not much retention or lacing, a little bit of a ring.
S: The sweetest, freshest tropical fruit you can imagine: pineapple, peach, mango. Grapefruit and orange ring. Some pine on the finish. I think this is the first 5 I have ever awarded. 
T: Doesn't quite follow nose, though darned good. You get more of the grapefruit/orange peel vibe first, followed by the pineapple and peach. Light malts carry through to a resiny and piney finish with the just the right amount of light bitterness.
F: Medium body, light to medium carbonation. Resiny, yet doesn't linger overlong as ABV and carbonation dry at just the right time. As well-constructed a beer as I have ever tried. 
O: You know, friends, it just don't get any better than this. Hope I get a chance to try another one someday. 974 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Apr 17, 2016

A= Copper, but not red/amber, hint of orange.  A little bit of haze, but fairly clear compared to many NE IPA/DIPA.  The lacing is seriously crazy, sticky, syrupy, beautiful.
S= A bit more muted, a bit less in my face than expected, but still appealing.  I get tropical, citrus (especially grapefruit and orange zest) as well as some malt sweetness and pine.
T= Deep hoppy flavors, mostly tropical fruits but definitely some earthy dankness, pine, and malt sweetness.  I want to drink more.
M= Fairly full bodied with a bit of syrupy feel on the palate.  Moderate carbonation. 
O= This met my expectations.  I have had Triple Sunshine multiple times, but rarely get a full bottle of this.  I love Sip of S, but this is a completely different beer and blows it out of the water. 816 charactersjhavs, Jan 26, 2016

There is a good amount of lacing as the head subsides. The aroma was straight dank; you get a lot of pine and citrus with this one. The taste pretty much follows suit with a nice even balance throughout the whole bottle. The mouth feel has solid carbonation (not too much, not too little) with a slight dry finish on the palate. The hype surrounding this beer is definitely real. Lawson's totally delivered with this one!! Cheers! 555 characterstregan_20, Jan 07, 2016

I shared the bottle with 2 friends that agreed that this just wasn't very good.

Taste is sweet and smooth, with a caramel sort-of malt.  Hoppier than Sip of Sunshine for sure.  Finish is dry and bitter.  Overall, pretty good.  Well above average, but for Lawson's -- they've done better.  I may actually take a standard Sip of Sunshine over this beer.  I think the Triple Sunshine stood out a bit more than this as well.  Still... a nice DIPA, and I'm really glad to have tried it. 508 charactersanteatr23, Dec 10, 2015

Drove to Winooski, waited in line from just after 5a to secure my bottle (HT and Sip too) and this just missed the mark for me. A bit muted compared with the other ales I've had from Lawsons.

Perfect IPA. 280 charactersnwildfire, Nov 30, 2015
3.9/5  rDev -14.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Lawson's tulip glass. Acquired in a trade. 
Pours a deep amber body with a nice frothy white head that sticks around for a while, leaving some lacing and a good amount of retention that sits on the surface for a while. 
Aromas seem muted and subdued.. I get some grapefruit and pine, peppery and floral hops, a little buttery diacetyl, sweet caramel maltyness. Doesn't smell as potent or inviting as others. 
Upfront on the tongue is sweet caramel malt, followed by grapefruit/citrus rind bitterness, floral notes, creamy orange sorbet, but it takes a hit because I still get a buttery diaceytl off-note that distracts from the overall hop character.. on the finish is a somewhat cloying bitterness. A little off-balance. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation.
Somewhat underwhelmed by Double Sunshine.. between the muted aroma and odd flavor profile, I probably wouldn't seek this out again, but I am happy that I got to try it! 972 charactersgcamparone, Nov 30, 2015

The pour is a slightly hazy, bright golden orange color. The head is a 2-finger, beautiful soapy white color. Whilst the head dissipates rather quickly, it leaves some gorgeous cobweb lacing around the glass. 
The aroma is booming with floral notes, but has a nice balance of tropical fruit aromas and pine resin as well. I get notes of grapefruit, orange, and tangerine, as well as some pineapple. There's plenty of bitterness there but it's balanced out by the sweetness of the tropical fruits. Not getting a lot of malt here, however. 
The taste starts off bitter, and even slightly tart, but is followed by the sweet orange and pineapple character. The back end returns to bitterness from the piney, earthy notes. Very dry, but not a lingering dryness. Very floral and very tropical. The cracker malt just barely makes its presence known as the beer warms. 
The mouth is medium-bodied with pretty good carbonation. Once again, very dry, but the dry bitterness does not linger for long. 
Overall, while I'm not sure this beer meets the hype it receives, it is still an absolutely fantastic version of the style and one that is absolutely worth seeking out. I've been trying to get my hands (and lips) on this beer for quite some time now, and I am ecstatic that I was finally able to. 1,354 charactersScaryEd, Nov 28, 2015

A - Beautiful pour.  Three fingers of bone-white head on top of a bright peach gold body.  Nice retention and lace.
S - Really odd nose.  Roast beef and strawberry jam... hopefully there isn't something wrong with the bottle.
O - Unfortunately there is definitely something wrong with this bottle.  Malt body with pine, cilantro and a touch of citrus but then loaded with a off-flavor of roast beef through the finish.
M - Smooth medium body.
O - A contaminated bottle.  Sucks given how much we traded to get it  :( 563 charactersvfgccp, Nov 21, 2015

O- Another very good IPA from Lawson's. I feel like it it too similar to sip though. Still glad I got a chance to try it. 499 charactersNotAlcoholicJustAHobby, Nov 15, 2015

Get the scent from a few feet away. Noticeable malt backbone. A dank resin on the taste and feel. Some orange & peel. A little juicy and a little sticky. Medium carbonation. 285 charactersHootie159, Nov 15, 2015
4.18/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bomber bought at Winooski Beverage Warehouse. This was poured into a Lawson’s tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange almost brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that concaved gracefully to leave some bubbles inside of a thin white cap. The smell starts off with a sweet onion up front and then some light tropical fruits and a delicate sweet and bitter sprucy piney stickiness. The taste was mainly bitter backed up by a light sweet tropical fruit revolving around the pine. Bitter sticky piney-ness leading into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a good sipping quality and a danky sweet stickiness clinging to my tongue. Some slight hop oils lay down to want to allow a certain slick feel, but still indicates a well balanced oily to slick and clinginess on my tongue. Overall, what a wonderful DIPA that I know I would have again. 922 charactersBack_in_the_Saddle, Nov 15, 2015

A quick base of sweet malt, big blast of fresh juicy fruit, quick bitter nip, and it all lingers long into the afterglow.

5/5  rDev +9.4%double sunshine - lawson's finest liquids double ipa
abv 8%
appearance: very interesting pour starts of a starbright sunrise orange color. half way through the pour color starts to darken and get slightly hazy. end of pour continues to add haziness and ends up a over ripe peach hue. this even after i gently rolled the bottle before opening. attractive soapy, loose off white bubbly head, with a decent retention. 
aroma: i was expecting to be instantly blown away by the nose. i was actually a little bit disappointed, i felt it was slightly muted. decided to let it sit and revisit a few mins later. now i could get nice sweet pineapple, mango, peach followed by some really interesting sour grapes and bright crisp green apples. slight earthy, vegetal ending. i don't get any maltiness at all. 
taste: i've never had an ipa that has tasted like this. so fresh and juicy loads of tropical fruits that swirl around with that subtle sour grape i got on the nose. crisp snappy green apples with a floral rose petal and honeysuckle in the middle. nice earthy, herbal notes that come in right before the slightly sweet bready malts. 
mouthfeel: medium body and carbonation. one of the craziest snappy quick dry finishes i've had to date. this beer drinks do wet and juicy and literally when i swallow it sucks all the moister out of my mouth begging me to drink more. 
overall: having the opportunity to have the top 3 rated ipas back to back to back in the same night was mind blowing. i truly think that ds is an outstanding beer. the taste is super unique and delicious. i feel like i could smash multiples of this no problem. with that being said i feel like it lacked that in your face aroma that heady topper has. the flavor profile i would put above pliny so results for me would be: 
1. heady topper 
2. double sunshine
3. pliny the elder
rating: hard to give this anything but 5/5 zombie heads! 1,904 charactersBeerZombies1, Sep 03, 2014

A: It pours like every other DIPA, dark yellow/light orange color, hazy, pure white head, good lacing and good retention.
S: This is juicy stuff. Tons of fresh (slighlty unriped) pineapples, peaches, mango, clementines. A very sour but very tropical juice. Then, you get some of grass like hops that is typical to Vermont it seems. Sugars seem low.
T: This is  extremely tasty, tons of sour pineapples, peaches, mango and clementines just attack the tongue right at the beginning. Super fruity and juicy. Then you get a real solid hop smash of dry-ness that never gets chalky, but is always on the side of citrus peels and grass. A light sweetness lingers on after the storm to remind you of the fruit notes. Amazing.
M: Super light and never sticky, just like I love my DIPA's.
D: This is superbly drinkable. Like any top tier DIPA, you don't feel the alcohol at all and it has a similar level of drinkability as a tropical fruit juice.
THIS IS IT! This is the best DIPA I've ever had. It's the perfect blend of fruits, sourness, dryness, and just enough sweetness. This is a top tier beer and, to my tastebuds, this is better than Heady Topper. Damn near perfect if you ask me. 1,238 charactersflipper2gv, Aug 29, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +4.4%Gorgeous orange body with a soapy white head. Lingering aroma of citrus, tropical fruits, cantaloupe, really fruity with some dank aromas too. Flavor is terrific. Hops come through in a big way with all of the fruity hop flavors playing off of each other, but the kicker is a great toasty malt flavor. It sneaks in just enough to balance this one out nicely, but it is definitely a tremendously hoppy and bitter DIPA. Drinks great too, with a nice light body, but huge flavor. Damn this is good. 495 charactersstephenjmoore, Aug 27, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.4%From a bomber in trade
Pale yellow to light apricot color-- medium head
Aroma is citrus- light apricot, pineapple, and orange, with piney dank hops.
Flavors are similar and very well integrated.  What really gets you right away is the creamy-factor!  
Lush full mouth feel with good carbonation, almost no discernible malt (just the way I like it), and a mildly bitter finish.
Overall, well, the 5 speaks for itself.  Right up their with Heady and HF-several, but Abner comes to mind. 489 charactersReady4aHeady, Aug 23, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Double Sunshine was my favorite beer for years; the handful of golden batches that Lawson produced in bombers, sampled between the spring of 2013 and the summer of 2014, were the finest examples of what craft beer had to offer. Double Sunshine was -then- without a doubt, the best DIPA in the world. It was as close to a 5-out-of-5 beer 
Then, Lawson's went on a Double Sunshine hiatus, ceasing production for nearly a year and a half while Sean tweaked his formula for Sip of Sunshine in Connecticut. By the time Double Sunshine returned to the regular rotation in late 2015, the recipe had changed, the taste and smell of the beer had fallen off, and it seemed that both the brewer and the brewery had become less focused on delivering a beer masterpiece to the masses, instead relying on hype and reputation to move their lesser quality beers. 
In its prime, Double Sunshine was a hoppy, tropical, juicy, and wonderfully balanced beer. 
Current iterations of Double Sunshine are still very good, but I fear they will never match the greatness of the original beer. 1,070 charactersrodmanfor3, Aug 14, 2014

Amazing beer super well rounded, has tons of tropical fruit notes but also has great pine/resin notes in there as well, enough of a malt backbone to make this beer super drinkable and it finishes eaassyy...love this stuff 339 charactersDave_Heltzel, Jul 23, 2014

A: Pours a hazy light copper with just over a finger of white frothy head that reduces fairly slowly and leaves a fair amount of lacing. When the head reduces it leaves a thin dense layor across the entire top of the glass. 
S: The aroma coming out of the bottle before I even poured was a total dank bomb. I get a near even balance of pine and citrus, which I would give the slight edge to pine. When poured into the glass the same balance remained, but once it started warming up the pine became even more dominant. 
T: The taste is the opposite of the aroma for me. It's almost an even balance, only with the slight edge going to citrusy fruits. It remains this way through the whole glass. I can't believe just how much flavor is packed into this beer.
M: Perfectly carbed, leaves a slightly dry finish. 
O: My new benchmark for the style. The balance in aroma and flavor is near flawless. I am always nervous going into a highly rated beer, fearing it's all hype. Double Sunshine has absolutely earned it's reputation. 1,116 charactersroger617, Jul 17, 2014

Poured a nice medium amber color with excellent clarity for the first pour. Thin white head with nice carbonation. Later pours were quite cloudy. The hops really come through in the nose, with nice citrus, tropical, and pine scents. The taste is phenomenal with tons of tropical fruit, balanced malt, and a very slight bitterness on the end. Mouthfeel was very refreshing and crisp. This is an extremely well balanced IPA that matches its description perfectly. 515 charactersDawgboned37, Jun 24, 2014

It also points out how two beers can be so different yet equally fantastic despite being same category. Hazy apricot and gold pour. Fine carbonation that dissipates and leaves a light lacing along the surface of the beer. In both taste and smell, it is the anti-Heady and I don't mean that one is better than the other. All soft tropical fruits jumping out of the glass. Mango, pineapple, floral a bit. Just soft and gorgeous. Taste and mouthfeel follow perfectly. Again nothing similar to the in your face hops of Heady. Just soft and gorgeous hops layering on the tongue. So happy to have had the opportunity to try this marvelous beer. Seek it out, trade for it and savor it n 709 characterskingston2, Jun 20, 2014

A: Pours slightly murky apricot colour with 3 fingers of bone white head which lingers and leaves clumps of lacing along the sides of the glass. 
S: Bright and clean and sweet malts with citrus fruits, musk melon, musky mango and pineapple followed by hints of fresh cut pine on the finish.
T: Incredibly smooth and slightly buttery up front. and balanced with tropical fruits, citrus and pine that pair against middle notes of caramel malts. The sweet middle note slowly evolves on the finish to citrus bitters, notably grapefruit.
M: Medium bodied and incredibly smooth with medium carbonation.
O: Only of the most balanced DIPAs I've had with tropical and citrus fruits equally matched by caramel notes and a lightly bitter finish. I'm extremely lucky to have had a chance to try. 848 charactersFondueVoodoo, Jun 14, 2014

The nose is so so fruity and strong with tropical fruit punch, banana, mango, lemons, apricot, grapefruit and then a great caramel malt backdrop.
The palate catches that same fruitiness of tropical fruit, mango, apricot, lemon and grapefruit but catches a little coconut as well. There is some honey but fans of herbal hops won't be disappointed with the subtle dank herbal hop tones underneath.
The feel is light, easy and drinkable but some alcohol heat exists if you drink it quickly.
Rarely do I find a beer that matches the hype but this one lived up to its billing. 671 charactersKYGunner, Jun 11, 2014

Strong grapefruit and tropical fruits aromas. The taste does not disappoint, you taste exactly what you smell. The mouthfeel I think is what makes this beer awesome. A creamy, silky, yet slightly stickiness that lingers. Beautiful color and cloudiness. Unbelievable, this beer has ruined all IPAs for me. Nothing will ever compare. 434 characters2Xmd, Jun 08, 2014

A - Bright, glowing, golden hue, medium white head. Hazy, clearly unfiltered. I feel silly saying that this is one of the most beautiful looking beers I've ever seen in a glass...
S - Pineapple, citrus, sweet tropical fruits, light notes of pine. Very nice aroma. 
T - Lots of citrus and tropical fruit with some light, lingering pine notes. The malts take a bit of a backseat here, rather hop forward. As the beer warmed up, I noticed that a certain booziness really started to subdue other flavors - more boozy than I would have expected towards the end.
M - Tight carbonation, somewhat light bodied, leaves a slightly slick mouthfeel. 
O - This is an excellent beer, but I feel it's overhyped - especially considering the tight supply and availability of other great beers in the region. 913 characterstoconn, May 01, 2014

We went in hoping for Heady, and while they had just ran out, the disappointment did not last long, as the bartender suggested this fine DIPA to us as a consolation prize.
...if this is considered a consolation prize in Vermont, I need to move to Vermont immediately. I don't know anywhere else where second place feels like winning.
Served on-tap, consumed from a flare pilsner glass.
A: A slightly hazy golden coloring, like a sunrise peering through the morning mist. Only this one leaves you with a solid finger of pure white head, that slowly settles to a moderate cap. Not much lacing from what I can recall.
S: Two words. Miss Chiquita. This has got to be exactly what that mountainous pile of fruit in that woman's hat smells like. A dank explosion of tropical fruits, with a background of sugar. Much like other top notch DIPAs, this beer is a aromatic treat. 
T: Citrus from the get go, followed by light pine tones, minimal malt, and a clean, dry finish at first... but after a few mouthfuls the hops start to linger longer and longer. 
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, ever so slight resin cling... a beer that makes your mouth feel happy.
O: No hype. No pretense. No expectations. Just a damn good beer that goes about its business making hop heads very, very happy. A truly great beer, and one I hope to have again. 1,404 charactersuntitledeuphoria, Apr 27, 2014

Poured into a tulip glass, along with some great friends. Bottle was less than a week old, so it was super fresh.
A- Poured more yellow than orange, poured to a one finger head that held its own. Less opaque than the average DIPA.
S- Started subtle with a hint of pine, closed with a moderate pineapple scent. A very unique and smooth experience.
T- Hops hit you semi-hard, but very consistent over time. Bitterness comes, and holds with a very grapefruit flavor, extremely pleasant experience. One could even say calming.
M-Very crisp for an DIPA, and extremely smooth.
This was not too hard and not too soft. The Goldilocks of DIPAs. A top ten for sure. 719 characterskgncfl, Mar 25, 2014

The beer pours a slightly hazy orange amber color with good head retention and light lacing. The nose is interesting in this beer, and not what I was expecting. There is a LOT of tropical fruit on the nose, with mango, papaya, peach and cherry. There is some underlying pine and orange citrus as well, just enough to let you know this won't be hot mess of a malt bomb. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though as expected, there is enough hoppy bitterness to counter all the tropical fruit and malt in this beer. This beer is really a mouthfill, and I get almost something of a dry honey flavor in the midpalate as well. The mouthfeel is almost dense in this beer, and is very full, especially for a DIPA. Alcohol is generally well integrated into the flavor profile, though there was a hint of heat from the alcohol at the very end of the finish. 
A very nice beer, no doubt, though I'm not quite sure I understand the top 10 ranking. This sort of reminds of masala mama on steroids, and while delicious, it's really not in the same league with Heady Topper, Hop Slam or the two pliny's. Regardless, this a delicious IPA, and one I'm very glad to have finanlly had the chance to try. 1,267 charactersJohn_M, Mar 17, 2014

4.74/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I'll preface the review by saying that if you're a beer enthusiast and Vermont is within driving distance, albeit a trek, the hours spent in the car are worth the price of admission. Is it a double sunshine, or is it a solar flare in liquid form that just emptied into my Surly pint? Either way, this unfiltered masterpiece is looking more like a mimosa than a glass of beer. There's enough residual lace on my glass to give a dendrochronologist a beergasm. The nose on this (for me) is pretty straightforward: Juicy Fruit chewing gum and fresh cut grass. It tastes like a well-balanced mixture of tropical fruits with just enough malt backbone to give it that perfect kick. Not overly bitter, just exceptionally balanced and masterfully crafted. So smooth; so drinkable; the abv on this one is masked and then some. This is a stellar beer. Lawson's Finest has done what I'm sure numerous other brewers have attempted, but their labor of love is simply put -- better executed. To my fellow hop heads and self-professed IPA lovers, I implore you to seek out this beer. If it were more accessible, it would maintain a permanent residence in my fridge.
Well done. 1,161 charactersTheIPAHunter, Mar 16, 2014

4.02/5  rDev -12%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Solid beer. Nothing more, nothing less. The hype surrounding this beer, all the "juicy" reviews had me expecting more. Don't get me wrong, good, but not great. 
A - beautiful hazy more sunshine lemon than orange. Unfiltered, so as expected. 
S - More muted than expected. Aggressive swirl brings out grapefruit rind and a vegetal and earthy component. More impressed with the grassy raw earth component here than the citrus. 
T - there is a less than refined and raw earthy hop component to the taste which I can appreciate, although the "tropical juiciness" that everyone raves about is slim to none. The raw and bitter grapefruit rind is trying to shine, followed by lemony orange hints that make their appearance ever so slightly. Honestly, my 4 rating here is borderline generous. I'm slightly confused as to why this is frequently compared to other heavy hitters overly discussed on here. 
M - very nice, but not as "sessionable" as others I can think of that share the same ABV. 1/2 way through it gets somewhat mealy. After 22oz, I'm good; which usually isn't the case with most other 8% DIPAs. 
O - my trader on this one is awesome, reliable, and I'm assured this is not an old bottle. However, there's no bottle date, so I have no true reference to freshness. All I can say is that I'm glad I've knocked this off my list, but I can think of plenty of year round accessible beers that easily measure up to this one. Don't get me wrong. I'm very appreciative of this trade and opportunity. The coolest thing about this beer is the slogan in the label. "Straight from the green Mountains to your head." My type of people. 1,632 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Mar 14, 2014

A- Foggy non-transparent golden. Thick head with no retention. 
S- Very mild tropical fruit, with more malty smell than anything. 
T- Very sessionable, which is not a good thing when talking about a beer of such magnitude (though Pseudo Sue is sessionable too, but crushes this). Mild tropical fruits (mango, papaya, pineapple). 
M- Medium to high grade on this. Thicker than most. Lots of carb follows. 
O- I had expectations that this would be the best ever pale that I have had. It was way short of that. I could go shelf local and be just as satisfied. I will take one more look at this, as I just crushed a Godiva Dark Chocolate Bar that my have f*cked with my palate. I will seek out another bottle to look back on 854 charactersgueuzedreg, Mar 01, 2014

A: Golden orange, slightly hazy
S: Not a punch in the face of hops as you'd expect from most IPAs of this reputation, however the nose is fantastic. Full of mango and peach, there is something very very unique about it.
T: If this isn't the best tasting IPA I've had it may at least be the most unique. Major juicy mango, peach, pineapple fruitiness with some earthy and grassy notes in the background. Hardly any bitterness detectable, hardly any alcohol detectable. There is almost something savory or meaty about it, like biting into the flesh of a mango.
M: Juicy juicy juicy
O: This one is a real winner, I wish it were easier to get. 670 charactersanteater, Feb 25, 2014

Had a hard time decideing between the 3 different hill farmstead offerings, rising tide calcutta cutter, and Heady Topper but i was very happy i choose the Lawsons. To me this beer is a more well rounded heady topper. the taste has alot of simialarities but the mouthfeel of this beer is just so much better. The color was great and the aroma was out of this world. This beer is outstanding. So much going on with this one. Was blessed to get to try it on tap while i was there being the local bevy sold out of there delivery in 45 mins. If you are anywhere in the local viscinity of this beer on tap drop everything and get there if theres any left! 725 charactersHopHead_44, Feb 24, 2014

T- Super clean, super fresh and outstandingly refreshing! 
M- Outstanding! 
O- This beer is right there with the best of the best! Everyone likes to compare Pliny the Elder and Heady Topper but in my opinion this is better suited for the Pliny argument! These beers have more similarity. Double Sunshine gets the nod over Pliny in my opinion! Such an amazing beer! This beer is about as close to flawless as you can get!

T: Just like the aroma lots of citrus fruit mixed with a little bit of pine. Grapefruit and a big of orange and orange peel. On the back end it get bready malt notes.
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, dry on the tongue (love that).

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a hazy dark orange yellow color.
The aroma is hugely hoppy of tropical fruits. Juicy peaches, mango, as well as grapefruit and a bit of pine and earthy herbal and grassiness. Almost a Sunny D juicy or absurdly sweet fruit aroma.
The flavor follows with that tropical fruit and grapefruit citrus note in the front. It goes on and on with juicy tropical, oranges, tangerine, sweet mango, pineapple, passionfruit. Just an onslaught of juicy hops like no other beer. The middle has a light bready honey malt that adds a bit of sweetness. The finish transitions to earthy herbal hoppy and pine notes, fresh and bitter grapefruit peel. A strong bitterness on the finish, but with that "hop juice" flavor throughout.
The oats do this beer a wonder with a viscous, medium plus body that flows beautifully under the tongue.
I had it in a blind taste against Abner and Heady Topper, which I thought was my favorite beer of all time. This is now my favorite beer of all time. 986 charactersdar482, Feb 02, 2014
4.93/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served from a bomber into an Alchemist Will Becher glass.
Appearance- Moderately clear gold with full foamy two finger head that lingers long leaving great lacing.
Smell- Big pineapple, tangerine, peach, white grape, green apples, vanilla, earthy grass and pine. No booze smell or real malt aromas.
Taste- Flavors of the aromas are present. A soft vanilla mixed with the pine and grass are standing out wonderfully. Finsih is green grapes and nectarines. No hint of booze what so ever. 
Mouthfeel- Perfect body for an IPA. Smooth, no heat, medium-full carbonation, nice resinous quality. Super easy drinking.
Overall- The best IPA there is. I had it on tap in the summer at 3 penny and I've been dying to try it again. I wish it was easier to come by. 756 charactersSeanniek91, Feb 02, 2014

Nice grapefruit and slight pine after taste. Creamy and somewhat thin. Goes down easy with almost no alcohol burn. I remember when fresh the alcohol is not noticeable. This is a great double ipa.

I have to say it is usually my go-to when I'm there, even though they have Heady Topper, I choose the Double Sunshine mostly because it's harder to get then Heady Topper. Though it is almost an even trade off between Heady Topper.
A - Orange, with a hint of yellow, nice white head, served on-tap in a snifter beer glass, heavenly.
S - Perfect blend of citrus hops, the intense hop aroma is very pronounced in this beer. 
T - Oh god, the taste.. I can't talk enough about how amazing the taste of this beer is, the first sip you almost don't know what just happened to your taste buds, was that a grapefruit, or a beer, but in an amazing way. The citrus hops are so intense and so perfectly balanced, it hits all the right spots on your tongue, it's smooth and extreme at the same time.
Overall this is one of the best beers I have the opportunity to drink on a day to day basis. From the moment it leaves the tap, to the last sip of the glass, you'll be happy and satisfied for every second being in the presence of this beer. Lawson's has got a winner in this one. 1,156 charactersFreeTheHopFreeTheMind, Jan 21, 2014

Picked up from the farmer's market on December 21st, so my best guess put this at about 3 weeks of age.
A: Pours a hazy golden amber with 1 finger of off-white head. Light through the glass reveals golden highlights. This isn't the best looking beer -- not too far off from Heady Topper, to be honest.
S: I think I probably sat there smelling this beer for at least a few minutes before sipping it, and the aroma was fantastic. Incredibly deep and juicy fruit character -- grapefruit, pineapple, stonefruit, and guava. Pine and slight dankness round out the hop aromas, and the malt provides a nice sweet caramel note. Really a great smelling beer.
T/M: Flavor profile follows the aroma almost exactly; this beer tastes like a fresh squeezed juice. Juicy citrus character with a big guava note dominate the flavor. Through the sip, this beer is super wet and juicy, and yet the finish is crisp and slightly drying. Bitterness is there but not dominating. Mouthfeel is wonderful -- medium, juicy, and resinous with perfect carbonation.
O: This is a great beer without question. Very much an east coast/Vermont double IPA, the juicy and resinous hop character is abundant. For how difficult this is to procure (particularly in CA), I don't know that this is something I will seek out again, but I am really glad to have gotten to try it. This is certainly worth seeking out and trying. 1,508 charactersjdhowe, Jan 12, 2014
4.92/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle about three weeks old 
Pours a slightly hazy apricot color with big soapy white head that lingers quite nicely.
Aroma is floral and citrusy. Tangerine, orange juice, peach, pineapple, pungent flower, with a faint dankiness. Vary balanced aroma with a hint of sweetness.
The taste brings big resiny notes of spruce, orange peel extract, lemon, spearmint, bitter pineapple, dough in the shadows, and something earthy that I quite can't pinpoint. Definitely kumquat in there as well. Very unique flavor profile and doesn't really represent the west coast or east coast style of IPA. Some complained of too much sweetness in this but I can't taste it. The citrus hop character gives off a sweet like flavor but it's in no way off putting. 
The mouthfeel on this is surprisingly full and somewhat creamy. Have not had this kind of mouthfeel before in an IPA. It works with the flavor profile. 
Overall a world class IPA that doesn't quite make my number one spot but is definitely in my top five. Not another double IPA I could remotely compare to this. Well done Lawson's. 1,080 charactersMarcWP, Jan 11, 2014
4.51/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A huge thanks to Josh for bringing this out and offering to share it - this has been one of my top wants for a very long time. Poured out of a 22oz bottle into a mini chalice. Bottling date is about 3 weeks old.
Orange-amber in appearance, with about 2 fingers worth of a frothy white head (more so as the dregs are poured in the bottle). Cloudy overall, but not completely murky - contains a fantastic golden hue that lights up when placed against the light, as well as a greenish tint on the edges. All things considered, this does appear to be in the same league as HT. In other words, it's not the most important aspect that makes up what's to come.
I do love a fresh DIPA, and I especially love it, it seems, when it comes from Vermont. This is truly resinous, dank, flavorful stuff at the nose, but no different than other world class DIPAs I've had in the style. Stone fruit and tropical fruit marry fantastically, providing notes of peaches (freshly cut, in fact), apricots, mangoes, guava, pineapple, green melon, and pine, combined with a toasted (nearly nutty) toffee sweetness and caramel backbone at the finish. Very delightful - the only drawback is how quickly the beer's profile would shift into a one note pine-y, grapefruit soaked flavor over time. Otherwise, this is fantastic and jubilant.
The flavor proves instantly what I'd expect this beer to provide - an explosion of fruit, resinous hop oils, herbal flavors, and an overall magical drinking experience. Other than tons of peaches, a smörgåsbord of tropical fruits of all kinds (most notably, pineapple and guava). Combined with the bready sweetness (toffee and caramel, as well as a bit of honeysuckle), this produces an effect that is akin to drinking freshly blended guava juice. Never had anything quite like this before. Very wet overall, but finishes with a dry character that slowly becomes more predominant. As mentioned before, this becomes more progressively pine-y and grapefruit-like as it goes along, but the feel of the beer is always interesting - perhaps the most understated aspect in most reviews. This owes a lot to the yeasty profile of the beer, which is downright brilliant. Creamy, soft, spicy, and fruity. The carbonation is already great, but the yeast adds a texture that makes this pretty amazing to drink. Well done, with all things considered.
With that said, it's a ridiculously tough beer to get - from what I can gather, only through farmer's markets in specific towns throughout Vermont - but definitely worth trying once. One of my new top DIPAs, for sure. Although, I'm definitely curious - how many "Double Sunshines" are being brewed in this country and distributed in the same manner? There has to be more beers like this, out there, lurking in our local communities, waiting to be uncovered. Here's to hoping we cross paths again. Cheers! 2,858 charactersmagictacosinus, Jan 11, 2014

Liquid gold is the color, huge head that settles to 3 fingers, quite billowing. Rings cling to the side of the glass, swirling of bubbles ate every pour. Aroma is strong: clementines, tangerines, sweet peaches in fruit syrup, bit of sweetness, rich fruit. Flavor is a rush of sweet fruit, fleshy orange, less intense than smell. Low carbonation and low lying bitterness. Noticing that Lawson makes balanced IPAs, not hop bombs. Very happy to have tried this. 481 characterspapat444, Jan 01, 2014

Poured from a 22oz bomber, it's got a orange color and is very clean and smooth looking. Looks very appetizing. Smell is one of my favorites of all time and where this beer shines. Mango, pineapple, grapefruit are all strong on the nose. Taste was very nice and herbal fruity. Mouthfeel was smooth and velvety with a little carbonation that dissipated quickly. If I get another chance, I'll definitely grab another bottle of this. 496 charactersozzman54, Dec 09, 2013

4.2/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 22oz bomber. It pours with a rich 2 finger head that hangs around for a while. The copper orange color seems to glisten in the glass.
Smells of tropical fruits, mango and pineapple mainly, with some back end resinous pine bitterness and some sweet bready malts.
Taste pairs nicely with the nose. Bitter hops give way to the sweet tropical fruits, bready malts, and pine resin to finish. As the flavors linger, they play the bitter/sweet back and forth.
Mouthfeel is exceptional. Rich but not too thick and perfectly carbonated, this is how a DIPA should be.
Overall, I think this is a well put together beer. Not worthy of the hype surrounding it (I think Heady Topper is much better), but a solid brew none the less. 735 characterstaylor714914, Nov 05, 2013

This is one of the most well-made DIPAs I've had. The mouthfeel is clean and smooth and allows all of the citrus and light pine notes to roll across the tongue. The hops are well in balance and the body is only there enough to carry them forward with a light sweetness. This DIPA is a bit sweeter than I expected and doesn't have the huge citrus punch of other world class DIPAs. Certainly worth a try, and much respect to Lawson's for their quality production. 542 charactersPHBoiler, Nov 04, 2013

A: Pours a pale straw color with a few cm. of delicate, bright white foam. Average retention, leaving the glass with a solid ring and some swirls on the surface, and a few streaks of lacing.
S: Light, faint malt and a little lemon, then herbal/grassy notes, a little juicy orange and kiwi (?). Pretty well balanced and a relatively restrained aroma.
T: Bright, juicy tropical (kiwi?) and citrus, grapefruit pith, finishing with a mild-to-moderate bitterness which provides some balance, and mild sweetness. The finish is a nice contrast of sweet and bitter, like you would get from chewing on sugar coated white grapefruit. Delicate flavors.
M: Medium body and medium-high, nearly sharp, carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden.
O: A very good DIPA, highly drinkable and refreshing. I could see this as a superb hot weather beer. Not quite at the level of Alpine, Pliny, or Heady, but a solid second tier option. It doesn't have the big aromas or flavors that you might expect from such a highly rated IPA, but it excels in its balance just as I think Pliny does. 1,128 characterspmarlowe, Oct 29, 2013

Good retention and excellent lacing. As looks go, this is one good looking Imperial IPA. Lots going on in the aroma - tropical fruit, citrus, hints of pine and a distinct cat urine aroma. The best word to describe the nose - WOW! Sweet citrus hits the tongue first quickly followed by a strong hop bitterness in the middle and through the finish. All that Hoppiness is beautifully balanced by a solid malt backbone. Layered, complex, balanced, this IPA has it all. 
Medium bodied with good carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. Overall, this is textbook DIPA; tropical fruit, bitter pine resin, balanced by a sweet malt bill, this might be the quintessential DIPA. One of the best crafted DIPAs out there! 811 charactersJohnG190, Oct 27, 2013

Note: I revisited today 10/25/2013, with a 2 week old bottle from FleetwoodMatt, poured into an unlabeled snifter.. and didn't change a thing on this review. This beer is fantastic.
This beer's appearance is really something else. Pours a thick, creamy and hazy orange body. Having had a bunch of Hill Farmstead IPAs/DIPAs lately, this is just so different. It has a strong orange colour on this. Comes with a 2cm white head with very good retention. Looks very soapy on the surface and as lacing. Lacing is all over the glass. 
Smells so good. Smells so citrusy, but without much malt sweetness. Simply put, this is a hop aroma bomb. So much citrus here- tangerines, orange, and a little bit of grapefruit.. a little bit of breadiness and toffee attempts to balance it out, and its efforts are very much appreciated. It's a very strong, thick aroma. Wow.
The taste on this is delicious. Unlike the nose, the malts come out here more to just balance out the hops, but barely. Lots and lots of tangerine, mango and other tropical fruits balanced out just a bit by some caramel and toffee sweetness. There is some earthiness here, surprisingly, which mixes things up as far as Vermont IPAs go. It's also a rather bitter DIPA unlike the Hill Farmstead DIPAs.
Mouthfeel is really good in its own way compared to Hill Farmstead. It's not as smooth, but it is quite slick without going over the top. Solid carbonation, medium body, very resinous feel on the palate. Bitterness is high up there too, yet it is very drinkable without any hint of the 8% ABV.
Delicious DIPA. It's a nice change-up from the less bitter but oh-so-aromatic-and-creamy Hill Farmstead DIPAs. It's got that über aromatic nose and palate stinger.. yet it is so drinkable in its own way. It definitely provides a very full, complex sensory experience. Definitely lives up to the hype. It's probably my favorite DIPA overall, which gives it a 5/5 overall rating for me. Close to Abner and Ephraim, much better than Heady or Pliny. Highly recommend if you know a generous BA in Vermont. 2,183 charactersStevedore, Oct 25, 2013

From a bomber into a snifter
APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, fluffy looking, white head with good retention. Hazy gamboge orange with medium levels of carbonation. Head fades to a foamy cap and sticks to the sides of the glass. A splotchy wisp remains and leaves some dots of lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Really big nose with piles of tropical fruit. Pineapple, honeydew melon, cantaloupe and some grapefruit aromas. Big nose, fruity, and really enticing. 
TASTE: Starts off with some grassy hops, pale malts and honeydew melon, then moves into a big and bitter finish. Pale malt sweetness and a touch of caramel through the middle, then lots of hop bitterness with piney and grassy notes linger on the palate. Very flavorful and persistent, but lacking that tropical fruit explosion that the nose had advertised. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, smooth going down and finishes a touch dry. Bitterness lingers. Good feel. 
OVERALL: The nose was outstanding to say the least, but the taste just didn't follow suit. The tropical fruit that came out so well in the aroma would have been great in the flavor, but instead we were greeted with lots of straight bitterness and grassy hop flavors. Decent, but not what it could have been. Still, very happy to try this and look forward to more Lawson's in the future, as they've always been enjoyable. Cheers again boys. 1,492 charactersJeffo, Oct 16, 2013

Pouring a bottle into a snifter, the color is a nice nectarine hue.
Aromas, so sweet and tropical...juicy!!!
First taste, not a bitter IPA at all, but complex and hoppy and fruity. Piney notes, not too resiny.
Subsequent sips the beer balances out and I get a touch more bitterness.
Mouthfeel is great, not too thin.
Overall this beer is fantastic. It is perfectly named. It's juicy and sweet and full of sunshine. 457 charactersBoldRulerVT, Oct 03, 2013

4.52/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big props to BostonRyan to scoring some on a VT trip and sharing the love. 22 oz bottle 1 wk fresh poured into a Speigelau glass.
Light golden clear body with a thick creamy head of small and medium bubbles with great retention and lacing, hard to get much better.
Smells quite tropical with strong notes of grapefruit, mango, papaya, guava, orange, with more subdued hoppy grass and piney notes. Definitely a juicy smelling beer.
Great layers of complexity here with multiple flavor levels. I am getting that Citra tropical juicy hop profile, although slightly more subdued that the nose would indicated. Much more herbal and piney on the taste with surprising bitterness. No alcohol burn evident. Bitterness lingers.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a tad oily, moderate to high level of carbonation, a sticky and dry finish.
Overall an outstanding DIPA that I am privileged to have tried. In a style where such giants as Pliny, Heady, Abrasive, etc historically dominate, Double Sunshine comes close to a top 5 choice for me but falls just short, and I feel it's rating may be inflated by rarity. Still a fantastic brew though and a must-try at some point for all DIPA fans. 1,177 charactersMCain04, Sep 17, 2013

4.62/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. This has a couple weeks of age on it.
Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy, translucent amber and leaves a relatively dense two-finger head which lingers for a good while.
Smell: Nice combination of pine and tropical hops. The smell is rather subdued but definitely pleasant.
Taste: Big citrus & tropical hops come out right away - really delicious. This is very much like a "hop juice" which is just fantastic. Some earthy, piney tones as well. Extremely smooth finish. Alcohol is very well masked.
Mouth-feel: Fantastic feel. Very juicy. Solid medium carbonation with a medium, slightly creamy body.
Overall: Very high quality, citrusy IPA. The taste and feel really mix well with each other. This is a very drinkable IPA, very tasty, very hoppy. If only this one were available more readily. 836 charactersResuin, Sep 17, 2013

Aroma was sweet grapefruit and malt. Taste was just amazing....Nice citrus, floral flavors. Finishes with a beautifully smooth maltiness. Trying not to fall too deeply in love as this is a tough get. Highly recommended to anyone venturing to the northern reaches of Vermont. Imagine; Double Sunshine, HT & HF within half an hour of each other....Wow. 448 characterstwizzard, Sep 15, 2013

4.57/5  rDev 0%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.7522oz. bomber bottle with a simple plain white label and some gold foil over the cap. The label has an oddly shaped but cool looking sun, 8 maple leafs, a brief description of the beer, and the mandatory US info. A bottled on or a best before date would have been nice. A beer this of this quality deserves a special glass so I poured it into my Hunahpu Snifter. 
From behind the plain Jane label came a not so ordinary and impressive extremely hazy and pale lemon yellow colored beer. The color was a bit on the odd side, but in a good way. Now I'm seen some hazy Double IPAs in my day, but this one takes the cake. Usually I can see, at a minimum the shadow of my fingers on the other side of the glass. I held the glass up to the light and I couldn't even see that. That's some hazy goodness! Sitting on top of this beer was a 1/2 an inch pearl white head of foam. I was so distracted by the color and the beer's haziness that I didn't see how fast it receded. OOPS! What I can say was that it left behind a thin white film and a nice big fast sting of white rings along the side. Beautiful appearance! 
Was this beer brewed in Vermont or the Caribbean? If I based the aroma off where the beer was brewed, I would be forced to say the Caribbean. This hoppy beer is very tropical in the nose. There was a lot going on in the aroma, but some of the main fruit aromas in this beer were the pineapple, grapefruit, and mango. Don't count out the hops! Following the strong whiff of tropical fruits was a nice bitter aroma of citrus hops. This bitter citrus aroma lasted a long time before it through the pine. Pine? What? Who knew that they had pine trees in the Caribbean. A very good hoppy tropical aroma! 
If I had to guess where this beer was brewed just off the taste, I would be happy to say that this beer was brewed in the good ol' US of A. I don't think they brew beer this hoppy type of beer down in the Caribbean. This citrus hops were assertive without being over the top. Intermingled with the tasty citrus hops was some tart grapefruit, a splash of lemon, and a pinch of pineapple. The taste wasn't as tropical as the aroma was. The taste was more bitter and citrusy. After the citrus hops and fruits had their fun in the sun, the taste then finishes up with tea leaves and a tiny taste of toasted malt. A very well done not over the top hoppy beer. 
This was a medium bodied Double IPA that had a good amount of carbonation and a dry bitter aftertaste. Like the taste, the hops were assertive without being over the top. This hoppy aftertaste lingered on for some time after the sweet nectar left. 
This is one of those beers that raises too many questions. What are they doing up in Vermont? Why are their beers so good? What are they doing that the lower 47 states (not including Alaska and Hawaii) aren't doing to their Double IPAs? Overall, this was an extremely well done Double IPA. I would be very happy if I had another bottle. Big thanks to fellow BA mnbuffalo for hooking me up with this winner! 3,022 charactersAltBock, Sep 13, 2013

Type: 22oz. Gold Foiled Bottle
Glass: Heady Stemless Glass
Vintage: August 2013
Finally was able to acquire 2 bottles of this one.
Pours a crystal clear golden in color w/ a 1 finger white head that left big sticky lacing. Aromas of citrus, mandarin orange, grapefruit, fresh cut PVC pipe, and dope. The flavor was a touch of malt sweetness up front, leading into mandarin orange and grapefruit, and finishing with very mild herbal bitterness. The mouth feel is absolute perfection and what makes this beer what it is. Medium bodied, but sits pillowy in the mouth w/ Belgian like carbonation and finishes dry. As far as drinkability goes the bomber was almost gone before I finished the review, absolutely no need to share.
Overall, fantastic brew! A notch above Heady Topper, but the notch is very small. This is the 2nd best DIPA I have ever had just above Heady Topper and slightly below the mighty Sosus. 926 charactersmikeyv35, Sep 11, 2013

My feel is that it should be and would be in the top five if more people could get a chance to taste it. Hard to find and in very limited volume.

22 oz bottle served in a Lawson's snifter. Bottle a few days before imbibing. Huge thanks to kevanb for the share.
A: Pours a yellowish orange color with a slight chilled haze to it. One finger of white foam forms on the pour and recedes to a thin cap. Soapy lace is left down the glass.
S: Tons of citrus fruit on the nose. Hefty amounts of grapefruit with a mild tangerine/orange citrus sweetness. Minimal biscuit malt in the background as this is all about the hops.
T: The taste is even better and much balanced. A ton of grapefruit with fruity and earthy tone to it. Pineapple and mango tropical fruits with a sweet biscuit malt body to give it a little tangent amongst the heavy fruit brightness. Light bitterness rounds it out.
M: Light bodied with a medium carbonation level. This drinks like a single IPA/Pale ale with the flavor of a big DIPA. Huge drinkability.
O: Dangerously drinkable with a great representation of grapefruit. Probably the best I've ever tasted or smelt in a beer. Absolutely delicious and incredibly balanced. Hopefully I'll get to try this again sometime. 1,106 charactersTreebs, Sep 06, 2013

Bottle into 7venth Sun tulip
Double Sunshine pours a cloudy hazy light orange. It has a big three finger puffy white head that left soapy lacing all over the glass.
It smells amazingly of tropical fruits. Big and juicy aromas of pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. The grapefruit does hint at the impending bitterness but does not detract or dominate. Some bready and sweet maltiness comes through too making this even more complex. 
Grapefruit is at the front of the tongue but the juicy citrus is not far behind. All aspects are in perfect balance. A little more bitter pine like at the back of the tongue but after all this is a DIPA, right?
Medium bodied and great creamy, sticky feel. A perfect level of carbonation on this only makes the feel that much better. This beer just goes down remarkably easy, especially for a DIPA.
Near perfection for a DIPA in my book at least for what I have tried so far. I could drink this every single day and love it each and every time. I would love to have regular access to this especially during the summer. 1,087 characterssleuthdog, Sep 06, 2013

Appearance: Just as the name indicates. Super bright yellow-orange with a perfectly beaming white fluffly head.
Nose: Intense tropical fruit, tons of sweet lemon and bitter grapefruit. Every IPA aroma imaginable concentrated into one beer.
Taste: Lots of smooth mango and sweet melon up front, grapefruit bitterness follows, finish is clean light malts with citrus zest. The flavor is far more delicate and balanced than the typical aggressive DIPAs. Very good.
Mouthfeel: Light, effervescent, clean, and smooth. This drinks far too easily for its strength and flavor. One of the best drinking DIPAs I've ever head.
Overall: My list of favorite double IPAs is getting very crowded at the top. This one is certainly a standout among all top tier examples of the style. 810 charactersfdig23, Sep 03, 2013

A: Cloudy, beautiful. Somewhere between yellow and orange--a bit different from some of the IPAs I've had of late.
S: Overwhelming citrus hop profile, with an emphasis--as the label description alludes to--on tropical notes.
T: Akin to the aroma, this beer is overflowing with juicy, refreshing, fruity tropical hop flavors. I could drink this again and again.
M: Perfect & supple.
O: Having had what I believe to be some of the best beers Vermont has to offer, I somewhat reluctantly decided to give Lawson's a try despite the relatively steep pricetag. It's an obligation, really, when so many would kill to try such an amazing beer from a fantastic brewery. And, despite the fact that, even living just an hour or so from Warren, Lawson's beers are still relatively unreliable to come by, I am extremely grateful I dropped $10 on this guy. Double Sunshine is undoubtedly one of the best--if not THE best--DIPA I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. It is very much on par, for me, with some of Hill's best stuff in the category. Finally, this beer did something I had previously thought impossible--that is, make Heady Topper feel relatively subdued and simple. Try it if you can. 1,343 charactersBTVflatlander, Sep 02, 2013

S- Overwhelming tropical fruit (passion fruit?) aroma hits the nose as soon as the cap comes off the bottle. Subtle pine aroma with a floral quality. Definitely haven't had an IPA with quite this aroma profile.
T- Taste follows the initial impression from the aroma. Very fruity early on. Some piney notes. Overall, a very drinkable DIPA. Alcohol well masked behind the flavor. My wife liked this, and she is not a beer drinker. Almost too fruity for my tastes, though I'll definitely try this one again. (Assuming I'm fortunate enough to obtain one with the hour long drive and one bottle limit).
M- Well balanced flavor comes off quite light bodied and drinkable with a light carbonation.
O- Excellent DIPA. Lives up to the hype. Worth the time, effort and cost to obtain it? Definitely, though it may have to be a once every few months type of beer for me. 987 charactersvermontvet, Sep 01, 2013

Nose of rich, floral hops on the forward nose, with a tangy grapefruit backbone blending with a truckload of resiny character. Layered and inviting nose. Wow! Flavors are smooth and balanced, with a grapefruit tart and sweet blending with a peppery and resiny hops character on the forward tongue. Some roast characteristics toward the end of the palate. The hops characteristics provide both floral aromas and bitter, resiny flavor characteristics. Fantastic. Robust body, but light at the same time. The aftertaste is richly sweet and bitter at the same time, with a heavy fistful of hops resin and citrus tenderizing your palate into a blissful state. Smooth, bitter finish with a slightly drying feel. Fantastic beer! 913 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 25, 2013

A - Pours a hazy pale golden color with a faint orange tint to the body. A thick finger plus cap of fluffy bright white foam lingers for a good couple of minutes, slowly fading towards the surface and leaving behind sheets of foamy lacing on the glass.
S - Bright and citrusy. Sweet, juicy grapefruit from start to finish. Mild pine touches mixed along with some tropical notes. Grapefruit dominates in a very good way tho. Searching hard, I can find traces of light biscuity malt, but very faint.
T - Rich grapefruit juice-like bitterness. Very firm, crisp bitterness. Fruity, citrusy and a touch sweet up front lend itself to comparison to a fresh squeezed glass of grapefruit juice. Aside from the dominant grapefruit, there is some mild sweet malt, faint yeasty, bready flavors. Pine flavors come on a bit, especially as this warms up a bit in the glass. Alcohol is noticeable but not obtrusive - just enough to let you know that this isn't a session beer. Bright hop bitterness of rather high intensity - despite the heavy dose of citrus and tropical fruitiness, the bitterness of the hops cuts through and delivers a little bit of punch.
M - Thicker body than I expected and checking in just on the high side of medium bodied. Carbonation is mid-level as well, but has a soft feel on the tongue, slightly foamy, but mostly creamy in texture. This has a very sticky and resiny character to it...somewhat syrupy and viscous in feel. So much hop character - leaves bitter, citrusy, piney impressions for a long time after each swallow...like breathing in the ambient air from a jam packed hop warehouse.
O - Have had this several times before at ACBF, but only in sample sizes. First time I've been able to experience this beer fully through an entire bottle. This isn't the most bitter beer I've had and this isn't the most intensely hop flavored DIPA I've had either. However, this is one of the closest to perfect combination of hop characters I've ever had. Balance (if you can call it that) is outstanding. I don't mean the hops and malt work together in perfect harmony...this is derfinitely a hop forward beer as it should be. Balance of crisp bitterness, super juicy citrus flavors backed by some pine and tropical fruits, intense mouthfeel and inviting appearance make this beer a real experience. I am putting this in my top 10 beers of all time...having had this several times, I think I can eliminate the environmental factors that can cloud all of our judgements. Are there better DIPA's out there?...maybe, but this holds up to the best of the ones I've ever had. If there are better, I'd certainly like to try them. 2,687 charactersportia99, Aug 24, 2013

T- The pine and bitter hop bite up front are more than expected. As it warms more of the tropical fruit bursts onto the scene in a juicy smack to the face! There's a good bit of grapefruit bitterness in the middle/finish. There is a hint of butterscotch/caramel that balances things out. A bit astringent, but still delicious!

The scent brings lots of danky onion/grass/herbal hops punctuated by some citrus and light pineapple, tropical-ish notes. Not much to speak of for malt except for maybe the slightest whiff of caramel.
The taste is similar with an overall onion/herbal/earthy feel mostly overtaking, there is the same aforementioned citrus and pineapple flavor going on, but a surprising lack of fruity hops. Malt provides a stronger backbone with some nice biscuit and caramel.
The mouthfeel is very smooth, well-carbonated, brings a good amount of bitterness without nearing overpowering. High drinkability.
Not quite the tropical bomb I expected, pretty enjoyable however it's not my favorite hop profile. Definitely would like to give this another try. 852 charactersChico1985, Aug 21, 2013

Beer is cloudy orange with a moderately-sized white head. Head fades steadily, leaving good lacing. Looks nice!
Nose is striking. A huge dose of sticky tropical and citrus fruits. Orange, pineapple, grapefruit. Lovely!
Taste is in line with the nose. Quite bitter, with lots of juicy, sticky citrus and tropical fruit. A bit of pine. Great stuff. Alcohol is very well hidden- so easy to drink.
Medium bodied, moderate carbonation level. A bit oily. Nice feel.
Overall, excellent. A truly great DIPA- maybe the best. If I could get this at home, i would be a happy guy. 612 charactersjrenihan, Aug 19, 2013

4.53/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.58 oz. on draft at the Prohibition Pig in Waterbury VT. I was driving so I did not dare order more than that plus an 8 ounce Heady and an 8 ounce Lawson's Maple Wheat. By the time I noticed they also had Edward on the beer menu, it was too late. Dayum.
a: Clear gold with a finger thick head which dissipated to thin surface foam.
t: A bright and fresh delight of light malt and citrus.
m: Light and did I say fresh? Smooth.
o: A truly great DIPA which made me think of the name since it was like a ray of liquid sunshine and a cool summer breeze. So sad that you have to be among the midweek or once a month Waitsfield market incrowd in north central Vermont to even get a whiff of this outside a few bar/restaurants in Waterbury and Montpelier. But then that is some unknown amount of its appeal, the Elusiveness of Lawson's Double Sunshine IPA.
Admittedly it was a bad day to look for the Big Three VT brewers' products, a summer Saturday. But at least I got to taste the famous Double Sunshine. Maybe some day I'll get to drink a pint of it from an actual bottle.
UPDATE May 1, 2014: That day is here, thanks to my wife's willingness to endure a lot of driving time up and back from where DS is made available. In this case the Lawson's 6th Anniversary Beer Lovers Market at the Village Players Theater in Waitsfield April 19. I got 6 750s of the stuff and am having the first one tonight. I only waited this long because I had also managed to get two other Lawsons and several Hill Farmsteads I had never tried. 
New details emerge: this was poured into a Lawsons snifter, and is a hazy orange and the head stays fairly thick and persistent. Smell is intense citrus and pine, taste has powerful citrus and resin flavor and bite. Mouthfeel is medium with very good body. Overall outstandingness confirmed, but it does not taste as light as on draft at the Pig, nor as dominated by citrus. So changing ratings accordingly to: a:4.0-4.5, s:4.0-4.5, t:5-4.5, m:4.5-4.75, and overall stays at 4.5. And yes I pesonally still like it a little better than Heady, great as that is. 2,083 charactersscotorum, Aug 18, 2013

A: Hazy golden with a rich two finger pure white head. Looks beautiful and how I imagine a fresh IPA should look.
S: Pine, big citrus, tangerines, mango, and a slight herbal note. A bit of caramel, reminiscent of sweet pralines.
T: Taste matches nicely with the aroma. Lots of sweet and juicy citrus, a little bit of pine on the back of my tongue. There's a small amount of an herbal presence, but it's not overwhelming. I'm not a huge fan of herbal/medicinal flavors, but this really works beautifully with what's going on in this beer. The malt here is fantastic - Sweet candies balanced beautifully by those juicy hops. Wonderfully smooth and drinkable for 8% ABV.
M: Soft (almost velvety) and medium bodied. Perfect carbonation for the style. Hate when hoppy beers are over carbonated, and apparently the brewer agrees with me. 
O: There's a reason why this beer is so sought after: This is a nearly perfect beer. Beautifully balanced, extremely drinkable, and just a delicious beer experience. This is absolutely one of my top IPA/DIPAs, right there with Pliny the Elder/Younger and Heady. Was lucky to finally get a bottle of this. Previously I'd only had it in 2oz samples and half pints - a full glass is magical. 1,322 charactersAdamsDTD, Aug 17, 2013

AP: Nice rich apricot colour, fluffy white 1" head which took some time to settle down to a 1/4". Decent lacing on the sides.
AR: Sweet aroma. This one smells juicy and lush. Vibrant aromas of tangerine, mango, pineapple, clementine, guava and passion fruit. The fruity scents are dominating and not much a malt presence is noticeable, though I get a very faint bit of cereal grains. I truly hope the taste is as lively as the nose.
T: Wonderful juicy fruity flavourful hops on the taste. I get more of the malt bill on the taste as well, a light bready flavour with a hint of caramel. It's just enough to give it structure. The citrus fruits are a bit more prominent in the flavour than the tropical fruits. A nice bit of blood orange rind in the finish with an herbal note like lavender. The fruity hops on this are lush and juicy, which is what I look for in a DIPA/IPA that stands out. Delicious.
M: Moderately carbonated, slightly creamy body, clean off dry finish and a lingering aftertaste. Very nice.
OV: Brilliant brew by Lawson's. I shared a bottle Monday night with a couple friends, which was the 3rd bottle we shared (first 2 beers were other breweries), thus didn't get the full effect of how truly good this beer is. Now that I'm having this bottle by myself without having any beers before it, everything in this beer shines through. Double Sunshine is an apt name for this beer as it's bright with flavours. Every sip makes you want another. So glad I have one more in my fridge. 1,587 charactersGuinnessAtRogerWilco, Aug 15, 2013

4.9/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle from most recent Coop release poured into Lawson's snifter 8/23/13. Bottle is 1 week old based on when it was purchased. 
A- Pours a cloudy orange hue with a two inch fluffy white head. Medium to high carbonation is visible. Excellent retention and lacing. Over a few minutes, the head fades down to a quarter inch plug over the beer. 
S- Big dank hops followed by a blast of grapefruit, mango, and a little spicy note as well. Very small caramel malt aroma that is all but covered up by the tropical fruit and piney hop character. 
T- The initial sip before you swallow makes it seem like the beer will be a lot more tame than it really is. An absolute blast of grapefruit and pine intertwined with mango, orange zest, and an intense bitter note that leaves you wanting more of the beginning sip. 
M- The carbonation is medium at best, and overall the body is right in the middle of the road. This beer finishes extremely dry, accentuating the bitter notes and making it go down way too easy. I could drink a pint of this in a few minutes without even realizing where it had gone. There is a slight indication of the alcohol, but it is forgotten by the huge aroma and flavor this beer throws at you. 
O- Not my first time having this gem, and hopefully not my last either. An absolute treat to drink- definitely in my top 5 DIPAS, behind HF S&S 5 and 6, although this is solidly more drinkable than either Heady Topper or Pliny. If I could mainline this beer, I would. A hophead's paradise. 1,503 charactersjustforrazors, Aug 13, 2013

M- body holds up well, remains dry which accentuates the hop bite, solid

This review is for a recent tasting from a fresh bottle.
Decanted into a Lawson's goblet. Delightful golden-yellow pour, hazy, with a finger of puffy white head that retained forever, coating the glass with patches of lace. Aroma was a blast of citrus, pine, grass, honeysuckle, tropical fruits, herbal, leafy, mild toasty malt profile in the background comes out more if the beer is allowed to warm. Archetypical. All things good. This aroma is the bar...pretty much the standard that all comparable IPAs should seek to obtain. The flavor reflected the aroma, good good hops, citrus rind, pine, ammonia, grassy, herbal, pineapple, toasted grainy malt base, appropriately bitter aftertaste. A medium-bodied brew, crisp, fresh, and refreshing. Super drinkable, and a great example of a true American [D]IPA. 861 charactersRifugium, Aug 11, 2013

Poured a bright brass hue with a one finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing. 
The smell featured pine and apricot with a clean caramel. 
The taste consisted of spicy pine notes coupled with an earthy tropical fruit, some esters and a clean honey. 
The mouthfeel was toward the cleaner side of the style. 
Overall a superior user friendly DIPA. 429 charactersplaid75, Aug 10, 2013

Pale hazy orange in color. Head is super frothy and white. The aroma of this is outstanding. There’s so much tropical fruit here – it smells like I’m walking through a citrus grove. Grapefruit galore, with juicy mango and orange peel. A slight grassy and herbal smell rounds it off. This is the juiciest IPA I’ve ever tasted. The fruit stands out so much it’s ridiculous. It’s subtly sweet and not too boozy, making it extremely drinkable. There’s more grapefruit and mango, but also an herbal quality like a fine green tea. It feels thick and frothy in your mouth , but all the flavors in here are extremely bright and alive, while the malt characteristics fit perfectly. I don’t know how Lawson’s does it. 760 charactersgreenmtn1111, Aug 01, 2013

The best beer I had from many I tried on my Vermont trip. Pours and looks like orange pineapple juice. Smells like pure citrus hops, juicy and ripe as all hell. Tastes like what I imagine heaven is like- so fruity, citrusy. The hops are having sex with my mouth. Light bitterness lingers on the palate with each sip.
Medium bodied, great carbonation. Unbelievably drinkable, no alcohol presence.
Thank god for this beer. 506 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jul 19, 2013

Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a 1-finger white head that disappears but leaves traces all down the glass. Aromas are excellent, just a power punch of smells in your nose. Taste is similar to the smell, a myriad of flavors across your palette; citrus with the perfect balance of maltiness. Overall, one of the best double ipas I've ever had.

Poured into a tulip glass at the Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT.
Pours a bright yet hazy orange color with some bright golden hues. There is a nice white head that forms that is about one inch tall and of medium density. The head is soapy and sticky and it leaves some nice lacing as the brew goes down and as the head recedes.
Aroma is of dank and grassy herbal hops. Fresh cut grass notes and some amazing citrus fruit notes. Seems dry and bitter and I struggle to notice any balancing malt. There are some orange rind notes and tangerines with some slight bitter lemony notes as well. 
The flavor follows the nose. Starts of piney and resinous. Then, followed by some very very dank, grassy and herbal hop notes. These notes are then followed by notes of orange rind and mild grapefruit that get more intense as the brew travels. The flavor seems more balanced than the nose but still there is a nice citrusy explosion that dries the palette. Notes of orange and grapefruit a-plenty. Amazing medium body that seems thick and oily but goes down easy. Great dry bitter finish. 1,118 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jul 04, 2013

The smell is divine! Powerful tropical fruits, some citrus, some pine, it's a complex and wonderful hop aroma.
Taste is outstanding, but not quite on par with the smell. Same flavor notes, but not quite as strong and a bit on the bitter side for my tastes. 
Mouthfeel is great, though I think it could use a bit more body. Overall, this is clearly a world-class DIPA with few faults. If the bitterness could come down a bit, it would be one of my all-time favorites, but I'll still buy it every chance I get! And, thanks to Lawson's for keeping the price really reasonable! 694 charactersdougfur, Jun 22, 2013

A: Pours a foamy white head with mild head retention. The beer itself is a pseudo-cloudy light golden color with a fairly average stick.
S: Not as strong as I was hoping for, but offers an initial blast of citrus tones, strong grapefruit, pineapple with a bit of piney freshness.
T: Carries through with all aroma tones but offers a nice complexity overcoming its aroma, this thing is truly one delicious brew. You get that strong citrus flavor immediately followed by a nice malt tone. It manages to round itself out and end on a nice piney note. Amazing.
M: Soft, medium-bodied, moderately carbonated.
O: I came in with extremely high expectations of this beer, and honestly, it did not disappoint! I just wish it was a bit easier to find! 943 charactersklythjohan, Jun 22, 2013

Beautiful yellow golden color that betrays the punch it packs. 
Hops, hops hops! Bitter and pungent yet perfectly balanced, so piney and citrusey on the way down. Devastatingly light and drinkable considering the ABV, will seek this out next (and first) time I'm in VT. Well done Lawson's!! 450 charactersafi4lifer, Jun 10, 2013

This is a must seek, must have beer for any IPA lover. One of the finest, well crafted beers I have ever had...period!A crisp mouthfeel completes this truly incredible beer.

4.41/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Ive been wanting to try this one for awhile. Like most other elusive brews that trickle from the mountains of VT, my expectations are exaggerated beyond what is probably fair. However, this brew delivers the goods.
Bomber into a mini snifter, the brew appears a golden yellow color with decent clarity. A white froth rests stop with decent powers of retention and fades leaving patches of lace.
The aroma is quite tropical with hops initially that blend into more of a grassy and herbal note. A mild grainy almost toast-like or biscuit maltiness hides behid letting the hops be the leasing role. 
The flavor is rindy, herbal, dank and catty. All hop flavoring upfront without too much bitterness crushing the flavors. Like the nose, a bit of mild grain sweetness is toasty towards the finish which creates a really enjoyable balance.
This is a medium bodied offering with a modest amount of carbonation. Super fresh and just awesome. Finally a VT brew that not only meets the hype but surpasses all expectations as well. Sign me up for wanting more of this whenever it might be available. Wow, get some. 1,107 charactersstakem, Jun 05, 2013

I mean many 95-100 IPA's just paled in comparison. They seemed lackluster, which is a shame because alone they are excellent brews.
The nose is massive citrus, the flavor is huge grapefruit/orange/pineapple, and its bitterness is so smooth. My wife commented that it tasted like a summer day. I wish I could pump this into my veins!
As far as IPA's go Double Sunshine is more seamless than most IPA's made today. Lawson's makes some top notch beer. If you ever wanted to try a 100 point IPA, get some of this!
Bottom Line: Utterly fantastic! Memorable and beyond! 693 charactersTriggerFingers, Jun 03, 2013

I truly cannot find anything wrong about this beer. When the person poured me my allotment each time, I kept getting blown away. The aroma is, honestly, the closet thing we have to 'Ambrosia'. Every fruit you can think of: pineapple, mango, papaya, cantaloupe, grapefruit. Its the same for the flavor profile.
If I could say ONE little tiny criticism, is that the mouthfeel/flavor was just a TAD too sweet for me, but I am just nitpicking at this point. An absolutely amazing DIPA that I am lucky I got to have multiple tastings of. 668 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Jun 01, 2013

Pours a 1 finger foamy white head with moderate retention. Beer is a cloudy sunset. Lacing is stringy and patchy with decent stick. Average. 
Nose is mango, papaya and pineapple. Big citrus hop notes along with some cane sugar malt sweetness. Aromatic and very appetizing. Just what I'd expect a VT IIPA to be.
Opens citrus, resin, tree sap hop bitterness. Some papaya and mango in the middle with a big, cane sugar malt presence. Some spruce tips and grapefruit too. Finishes sappy and dry with a resiny, hop bitter aftertaste. Juicy, dry hop perfection! 
Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Resiny and sticky in the mouth and goes down dry and sappy. Messy finish with a lingering, sticky, dry aftertaste. Nice.
If you had to pick 3 DIPAs to represent The Alchemist, Hill Farmstead, and Lawsons, you'd probably pick Heady Topper, Ephraim, and Double Sunshine respectively. DS is not in the same conversation as the other two. However, that doesn't mean its not a world class beer. Worth trying and easily the best hoppy offering I've had from Lawson's. 1,171 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 23, 2013

4.75/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A: It has a hazy golden yellow body with an off white two finger head that hangs around for a long time.
S: One of the more complicated hop profiles I've ever had. There is a citrus dominate front that contains heavy lemon and grapefruit. It then transitions to a Simcoe pine heavy finish. There is a subtle caramel note running throughout the entire nose.
T: Nearly a perfect blend of malt and hops. The flavor is uniform from start to finish. There is a sweet caramel and bready flavor that is what an IPA backbone should be. The hops match the nose pretty well. There is citrus (lemon, apricot, and grapefruit), pine, and that dank hop flavor that is delicious.
M: Perfect body. It is very smooth and has a great carbonation bite.
O: I was expecting this beer to be good but overrated. I was wrong. This beer lives up to the hype. Well worth actively pursuing if you are a fan of well balanced IPAs. 906 charactersjvillefan, May 18, 2013

A: Cloudy straw yellow and lacks lacing. 
N: Sweet and hoppy. Grapefruit, pine, biscuit, and mango. 
T: Sweet malt, pine, some drying floral hops. Little bit of spice and pepper. 
M: Very drying and it's very clean. There's definitely some alcohol here. 
O: A worthy DIPA, but it's not a beer I'd gush about. Certainly a recommend if you like this style scraping and pine-filled. Definitely better than Heady Topper which we had at the same time. 551 charactersSarlacc83, May 12, 2013

A: Very slightly hazed pale amber body under an inch of fine off-white head. Standard retention, plenty of delicate lace. Attractive.
S: Much more subdued than I was expecting, but once I stick my nose down in the glass I get some nice ripe tangerine balanced against a keen minty herbal note. Lovely, but not the room-filling hoppiness I was hoping for.
T: My first sip more than makes up for any disappointment I felt from the nose, as this is a truly delicious brew. Richly juicy citrus hops are front and center, with orange, tangerine, grapefruit, and mango. Underneath the sweet hops is a layer of pleasantly bready malt, followed by clean herbal bitterness on the finish. Absolutely phenomenal. 
M: Soft, well-carbonated medium body. Velvety. 
O: Great. I think I'd still take Heady or S&S #5 over this, but it would be a tough decision. Worth the hype, and by far my favorite Lawson's IPA.

S: Not as in your face as I was hoping for, but still very nice. Lots of tropical/citrus fruit, some orange, grapefruit, and pineapple. A bit of pine and light caramel. A bit of sweetness as well. 
T: Similar to the aroma, lots of citrus fruit mixed with a little bit of pine. Grapefruit and a big of orange and orange peel. Faint caramel and bready malt.

A-Hazy dark golden color with a 1 finger head that leaves minimal lacing
S-Sweet tropical and citrus hops right off the bat with a little bit of pine mixed in. Also catch small hints of wheat. 
T-Follows the nose with the sweet citrus and tropical flavors with notes of pine and earthiness. The hops a kept in check with a nice hearty malty backbone that stands up nicely to that diverse hop profile.

A - Pours a beautiful, hazy, light copper, almost a dark straw color. Almost a good 3 fingers of chunky, foamy head. Definitely unfiltered and natural.
S - Huge citrus punch in the nose, Earth tones galore on this one. Very herbal. Hops mingle at the end, its an outdoorsy pasture smell, reminds me of working on the farm and bucking hay.
T - Huge wave of citrus and hops at first. At the end there is a light hoppy-bitterness but finishes in a flash. You are left with slight residues that punches your tongue.
M - It is a punch in the mouth, I know I have already said that, but its honestly the best way I can describe it. So many different characters roll across the palate. It finishes nicely, leaving a thick, almost juice-like aftertaste feel.
O - So many levels that are always changing. Every drink you can pick something different and unique up. Loved this brew. 1,039 charactersda_beers, Apr 30, 2013

A friend of mine here on Beeradvocate (Hendry) hooked me up with one of these, which are hard to obtain even if you live here in Vermont.
Look - Pours hazy golden (sunshine? haha) with a slight tint of amber in the middle. Full, foamy head with great lacing. 
Smell - Citrus and floral hop bomb to the face. Mouth-watering gloriousness. Grapefruit, sour orange, mango, and pine. These elements are apparent as soon as you pop the cap.
Taste - Immediately I noticed three waves of hoppy character. Blast of pine, blast of citrus, and a smooth mix of both and a casual finish. Juicy and full of flavor.
Mouthfeel - Quite a character, rugged and raw. Thick and hearty. Exceptionally drinkable.
Overall - Wow, utterly amazing brew. Complex, full of flavor and tough like a woodsman. Would highly, HIGHLY recommend. My favorite brew in this style and a bigger king among lesser kings. 942 charactersJMScowcroft, Apr 23, 2013

A hazy pale orange fills the glass with a nice bit of light white head. Aroma is straight up tropical fruits with lots of mango and grapefruit. 
First taste is fruity and juicy with lots of great hop flavors coming through. Grapefruit and maybe even a bit of pineapple in there as well. A nice malt presence that carries the hop flavors well. Smooth medium bodied feel makes it go down like a beer half it's strength. Overall, this beer is right on par with the likes of Heady and Abner but in it's own unique way.

Double Sunshine pours about medium orange. Darker than I expected. It's quite hazy, and that cloudiness makes the color seem a bit flat, rather than glowy. On the other hand, it has a truly excellent head. The foam is a bit rocky and bone white. Very good retention. A couple inches of bubbles stayed up for a long time, and there's lots of lacing. Bubbles are all over the walls of the glass. 
The aroma is a superb tropic fruit salad of hoppiness. Pineapple and mango for days. There's also some bright tangerine, lemon and peach flavors in the mix and a touch of pine at the end. Best of all, the aroma is fresh and strong. Hops hit me right as the cap came off the bottle. Juicy as can be. There's probably a touch of pale malt in the background, but this is a hop party. 
The taste is similarly loaded to the gills with tropical fruit hop flavors, though there's a bit more citrus to it. It tastes like pineapple-tangerine joy. It's sweet and bright, but the hops show a little muscle with some solid bitterness that courses through each sip. However, it's among the most flavorful bitter hop notes that I've come across, just a perfect level to keep the sweetness from running away. Mild honey-ish pale malt flavors hold up all of these wonderful hop flavors, and it stays appropriately out of the way. Finish is long and full of pineapple, pine and grapefruit hop flavors. 
Mouthfeel is creamy and full, but the beer still seems pretty light. There's a very pleasant hop oiliness to the beer. Carbonation is pretty normal. Good stuff.
This is an absolutely wonderful beer. I've had a lot of DIPAs, and this one is way up near the top for me. The hop flavors are big, juicy and bright, and the tropical fruitiness is just great. I particularly like the flavor-packed taste, which doesn't scrimp too much on bitterness. The malt doesn't get in the way, and there are simply no real flaws to point out. Lawson's is an absolutely wonderful brewer, and I'm happy to have this beer mark a reviewing milestone for me. 2,041 characterspopery, Apr 14, 2013
5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This sample was super-fresh, and poured into a Lawson's snifter a cloudy off orange/copper hue with a thin white head that dissapated relatively soon. The nose is a fresh mango that was dropped into a pile of fresh Vermont pine needles: immediately you get the sense that a taste explosion awaits you with such a marvelous aroma, and taste explosion is what you get!
Don't let other reviews that compare Double Sunshine to Heady Topper convince you that they are the same: there are similaraties, both made in Vermont, and are both hand crafted small batch hop forward cloudy double IPAs, but the similarity ends there.
Double Sunshine has a flavor all of its' own, and my best description is a major league "mango bomb!" The mango is one of those tropical fruits that seems to embody qualities from an array of various fruits,and when fresh is a taste sensation. The carbonation seems perfect though difficult to see through the cloudiness, and the mouthfeel is a nice medium: nothing thin here and it hits the palate just right with some oily goodness.There is an ever-so-slight alcohol warming felt in the throat, but that won't distract you from the complex flavors. Lacing is good, not crazy but again the magnificent flavors overcome any aesthetic shortcoming one might conjur up. 
The mango-pine needle blast leaves an aftertaste that seems to go on forever and is exceptional, keeping you coming back for another delicious sip. An excellent example of small batch craft brewing that you just can't get it in a 6 pack format.
Bottom line: the hype is very real for this bottled liquid gold, and like Heady Topper, has a way of spoiling one to the remarkable qualities of innovative cutting edge Vermont craft beers. 
Double Sunshine is one of those rare hand crafted IPAs that simply must be tasted to appreciate the excellence, and if you are lucky enough to get your hands on some you are not likely to be disappointed. So far, the top of the pack in my book. Swirling Double Sunshine around a bit in the Lawson's snifter creates a wave of aroma that is second to none for my money, and worth the tremendous effort to obtain these heavenly bombers from the Green Mountain of Vermont.
UPDATE: Hard work pays off when you can score multiple bottles of Double Sunshine, however it is a two edge sword as most other beer does not begin to compare. The batches are truly micro and require a lot of perseverance to get multiple bottles unlike Heady Topper which has become much more visible in local convenience stores.
UPDATE: 6/21/13 NO ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT, THE BEST I HAVE TASTED!! 2,593 charactersHendry, Apr 14, 2013

A - I am a sucker for the unfiltered IPA look. Looks like cloudy lemonade, maybe a shade or two darker. Thick white head, pours to about 3 inches, dissipates quite slowly. Leaves moderate amount of thick lacing. Very very nice.
S - smooth citrus, lemon, grapefruit. Also some juicy tropical notes, like mango. Clean and crisp.
T - this is a full spectrum IPA. Leads with juicy tropical fruit, then orange and grapefruit. Lingering around is some bitter piney type notes. The is a clean and quick punch of bitterness to finish and leave with a rich bitter orange peel after taste. Damn near perfect.
M - great. Nice hop oil. It's interesting in that the carbonation is a little hidden at first and then at the end there is a prickle of carbonation. Really nice.
O - certainly a top shelf, private stock, so good you don't want to share it IPA. Ranks second only to heady in my opinion. This is one of those beers that, if you had to pick one beer for the rest of your life, it'd be a front runner. 1,056 charactersBeerandboards, Apr 02, 2013

A- Pours a very light golden, Literally like sunshine in my glass. Small head that sticks around decently
S- Very grassy with some citrus notes. Hints of booze
T- Like the smell there is the grassy hops in here as well. There's citrus in the middle and booze/pale malts in the end
M- Good carb. Nothing out of the ordinary, well done

Looks as good as it could. Body is cloudy pear gold scattered with slow, sparse but consistent beading. A finger of bone white head resides to form a thin cap leaves dramatic lacing all around the glass. A thing of beauty, really.
Incredibly juicy on the nose... massive citrus, honey, pineapple, a pine presence that really holds its own against all the fruity hop aromas... some sweeter fruits like peach and plum. Nose-gasm all up in this piece.
BAM. It seems a bit more conifer focused on the palate... then there's syrupy tangerine and bitter orange zest. A very faint alcohol character is tied seamlessly to the bitter hop contributions. Especially slick... the hop flavors cling to the tongue as my beer weiner stiffens. There's a nice little sweetness that shows up mid palate which is pretty unique and lets that big fruity hop profile do its thang. 
The best IPA I've had? Quite possibly. Thank you Frank! 1,003 charactersyamar68, Mar 30, 2013

Pours a golden amber with a layer of off white. The smell is rather sweet with a pleasant hop note. Slightly floral and bit dank. The taste is light and bitter up front with a more dominant bitterness towards the finish. There is a really nice grain sweetness behind the hops. West coast ip front and east coast in the finish. 365 charactersoline73, Mar 22, 2013

Smell is daaank zesty lemony and orange hops, sweet flower petals, touch of honey, hints of bitter grapefruit and a melange of light tropical fruit, and then some more dank. Pungent.
Taste is big juicy pineapple and lemon zest, sweet at first fading into a more bitter grapefruit hop character, finishes spicy and floral with a touch of pine. Complex and delicious.
Mouthfeel is super rich and thick, almost syrupy, but with healthy carbonation and great drinkability. Perfect.

S: A symphony of hop characteristic with a light sweetness that isn't the least bit cloying. Citrus rind, orange juice, fresh pine boughs, some mango and passion fruit, fresh herbs, I could go on forever on the aroma notes in here. Each whiff brings up something new and enticing!
T: This beer is fresh and crisp, with pound of flavor, and it's not afraid to get a little dirty. Well-balanced, with a nice juicy sweetness to form the backbone, with hop, hop, hop flavor layered on top. Notes of succulent tropical flowers, grapefruit and pine hops, some earthy grass and dirt on the swallow, with the overall impression that this beer was fresh squeezed from some magical beer fruit, or tapped from some magical beer tree. This tastes organic and natural and pure.
M: Clean and crisp with just enough to chew on to give you texture. You feel just a touch of the 8% abv in terms of heat, but mostly this is refreshing and juicy feeling. Not dry like some DIPAs I've had. This beer isn't out to destroy your mouth and palate, but more to dance on it and excite it.
O: World-class. This is how I imagine DIPAs would taste if they were found in nature. Harmony of flavors and feel, with a nurturing quality to the taste. Outstanding and worth whatever wait you need to get it. 1,430 charactersFeloniousDrunk, Mar 19, 2013

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I dont feel as if I need to say much- best doub I have ever had. To me its even better than heady topper, although they are two entirely different doubs. More fruity than a heady- overwhelming mango and more subtle apricot and papaya notes whereas the heady has more of a citrusy pink grapefruit and tangerine taste. Extraordinarily well balanced with the perfect ratio of fruit and subtle citrus an pine resins followed by a supremely smooth hoppy taste. There is really nothing I would have changed in the brew and I plan to buy another 5 this Thursday at the Warren General Store. If you have the chance to get your hands on this unique brew in Warren then I highly recommend that you do so-I cant say there is anything more worth your time. 744 characters80x2HopHead, Mar 19, 2013

A:golden yellow bright in color with a fluffy bright white head that goes away but leaves a thick lacing. It is cloudy and completely opaque 
S: Smells like fresh piney resiny hops definitely some citrus in there too really good quality smell not your average hop bomb 
T: follows the nose very fresh hops with pine resin flavor but not overwhelming there is also a little bit of juicy citrus flavors like pineapple nice bitter finish but fairly well balanced for how hop forward this is not overwhelming. 
M:smooth slightly resious/sticky feel but not that much but also juicy I use that word instead of watery because it is a little thicker while stile being thin and has a citrus feel. This aspect makes it extremely drinkable and the alcohol is totally hidden.
O: great Beer nice juicy fresh hops with a juicy extremely drinkable beer it is probably the most drinkable dipa I've ever had. I think this is Lawson's. best ipa and I highly recommend it if you can get it and drink it fresh 1,022 charactersPinknuggets, Mar 15, 2013

Pours, well, sunny. Yellow, mild haze, bright orange tones, bright white finger of head, fairly lacy. The aroma is good, but not hugely pungent. Herbal hops mixed with a jarring bit of tropical fruits dominate. Taste though, is a tropical fruit laden punch in the mouth. Mango and pineapple, robust herbal notes orange and grapefruit, with a soft maltiness and medium bitterness. Solid upper medium feel with good carbonation lends a lighter, refreshing feel and a dangerous drinkability. 
All in all, this IIPA is every bit worth the trouble to get...or no trouble all cuz miamilice is a beast and extra'd it. Thanks Matt! 720 charactersEgadBananas, Mar 12, 2013

This is a very close second. Cheers
Side by side with heady topper and dc brau on the wings of armageddon on 3/2/14.
Agree with my original tasting review, only thing that I would like to add is this has the best nose on it imo of any DIPA i've ever had. Still take heady overall as my favorite, but the nose on this thing is the best. cheers 592 charactersVeganUndead, Mar 11, 2013

Pours a light, golden-orange hue with a dense, half-inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Nose is fairly subdued with some light citrusy notes only really coming forth. Taste reveals citrus, buttermilk and an earthy/herbal quality. Finish expresses a slight biscuity character. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a creamy texture and a slightly oily quality. An easy drinking IPA, but not what I would consider a DIPA per se (perhaps it's the cask conditioning). I was lead to believe that Double Sunshine was a juicy DIPA loaded with fruit; however, I don't get this here. I'll have to see how the presentation in the bottle compares with the cask. 761 charactersJwale73, Mar 05, 2013

Appearance: Golden yellow straw, pale reflected sunlight haze with a small white head.
Aroma: Subdued grass, slight lingering citrus notes of orange, grapefruit, and pineapple
Taste: Initial bitter pine followed by the citrus. I notice the presence of chinook and certainly citra hops in leading roles. Luscious and juicy with a finish like taking a bite from a ripe tangerine. The ABV is well hidden.
Mouthfeel: Balanced and well carbonated. However, it taste fragil, as if this beer could not stay cohesive in the long run. 563 charactersTrystero, Feb 26, 2013

Appeared a cloudy golden orange color with a 1 finger, perfectly white head that vanished quickly.
Smelled of intense citrus and pine.  Very little malt in the nose.
Taste is delicious. First you are hit with citrus, followed by some pine in the finish.  Light sweetness balances it all out.  This is one where the hops shine - little behind them.
Solid mouthfeel - medium carbonation.  Almost silky.
Overall this is an amazing DIPA. 481 charactersTWStandley, Dec 28, 2012

I'm a lover of IPAs and this one ranks up there, Top 5 for me all time. Smell was a full floral scent, a mixture of hops and citrus. The taste was very similar to Heady Topper. If there are differences, they are slightly noticeable. Very light tasting with a slight bitterness to it but very well balanced. This is one of the best IPAs out there. Not quite better than Heady but I would definitely rank it above Pliny. Love this IPA and can't wait to have it again. 551 charactersnootch23, Dec 13, 2012

T: lots of passion fruit in the flavor alongside fruits such as mongos, pineapple, a little peach, good pine earthy notes with a grassy hop character that had a mild hop bitter punch. I did however get some woody and slightly vanilla accents.

This is right up there with Heady Topper and anything by Hill Farmstead.
I travel to the Warren Store often and depending on what the selection is at the time,i can usually score me up some tasty Lawson's. I'm always up for trading, let me know.
Okay, the double sunshine is almost do i dare say it: Heady Topper.
Same look and feel but taste a bit more bodied. Beautiful gold color, super creamy from head to finish. Very thick lacing, and such an inviting nose. One swallow and the first thing to come to mind is: Liquid Gold! I'm not sure of the hop content, lets just say Hop Heads are smiling every where about this beer.
I'll post a review on the Triple IPA as well, have a few in the fridge right now. 782 charactersVermont-the-Trader, Oct 07, 2012

Poured from a bomber to a pint glass.
Appearance: Looks beautiful--hazy copperish gold with a nice head. Crazy lacing left afterwards. Head pretty much retained throughout drinking.
Smell: Mango, citrus, slight pine. Slightly sweet caramel? So complex.
Taste: WOW. If the smell is complex, I'm lost at the taste. So freaking good. Mango, grapefruit, yet so balanced with the sweet caramel and toffee malts. Some pepper and warmth from the alcohol on the back end. So enjoyable.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied feel, goes down smooth.
Overall: I've had Pliny, Heady Topper, Hopslam, and other highly rated IPA's, and I'd put this with the best of them. I appreciated how balanced it tasted--you really appreciated the freshness and effort put into this beer. A world class brew. 847 charactersMagicJeff, Aug 29, 2012

A: a rather hazed orange body. white bubbly head w/ good retention and some nice siticky foam left behind. 
S: piney, minty. deep fruitiness. citrus rind. orange and lemon. onions and hot peppers? just writing whatever comes to mind when i take a deep wiff. crazy. however, in conclusion, starts super fruity, a wave of citrus, moves into earthy pine, mint, and dill. 
T: reminds me of a creamsicle ice pop. especially with the mild vanilla-like flavor that lingers into the finish. the sweet linger on the finish also battles a decent amount of bitterness. orange juice. a minor touch of alcohol heat? 
M: the body is surprisingly light for the ABV. drinks more like a really hoppy pale ale. carbonation is subtle and seems all naturally formed. adds to the creamsicle component. 
D: another really solid DIPA from the green mountain state. dangerously drinkability reminds me of Heady Topper. definitely worth trying. 986 charactersJimmys, Aug 28, 2012

A- Pours a hazy yellowish golden with just under a quarter of a finger of white head that quickly recedes to leave almost no head and some spotty lacing. A little bit below average carbonation.
S- Citrusy tangy slightly dank hops, lemon, grapefruit, a little bit of pine, some light malts in the background. 
T- Citrusy piney hops, grapefruit, lemon, finishes with some citrusy dank hops and a tiny bit of booze. Citrusy lemon aftertaste. Everything is very well balanced.
M- Fairly light bodied, not too much carbonation, smooth, easy to drink.
O- This was a very good IPA, definitely world class. However not the best that I've had. Personally I like HF the best. This is definitely right up there with Heady Topper and other great IPAs. Definitely stands up there with some of the best I've had. Just a little bit more hops in the aroma, a tad bit less booze in the taste, and a tad bit more carbonation and I think this beer would have been perfect. Definitely recommend having this for any hopheads, you will not be disappointed. 1,176 charactersjaasen64, Aug 14, 2012

Served in a tulip
Thanks to CADMixes for generously sharing this bottle.
The beer poured a hazy, light orangey-amber color and was topped by a bubbly, bright white, sea foam head. Excellent retention. The head deposited small droplets of lacing all down the glass. As the beer warmed, the chill haze dropped and the liquid turned nearly clear.
A cornucopia of tropical fruit notes came through in the aroma. Tons of mango and papaya. Lots of pineapple. Strong notes of orange peel. Quite peachy as well. There was a pervasive sweetness, but this seemed to come from the fruitiness of the hop profile rather than from an abundance of malts.
Like the nose, the flavor profile was amazingly rich and complex. Tropical fruit notes dominated. Lots of mango and papaya. Good amount of candied citrus peel. Strong peach notes. Touch of pale malts. The finish was crisp, piney and moderately bitter. It provided the perfect balance to this otherwise fruity and sweet DIPA.
The liquid was medium-full bodied for the style with a fine, moderate, tongue blanketing effervescence. Silky smooth and supple. At 8% ABV, the alcohol was nowhere to be found.
Double Sunshine IPA is one of a handful of double IPAs coming out of the state of Vermont that defines excellence within the style. Thank you CADMixes for giving me the first opportunity to actually have a full pour of this glorious nectar. 1,425 charactersDamian, Aug 13, 2012
4.71/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A - Appeared orange-golden with 1 inch slightly off-white head with medium sized bubbles in a 4oz taste-tester glass poured from a cask at the 2012 VT BrewFest
S - Potent fruity tones of grapefruit and really dank, delicious hops. Very floral and full of citrusy goodness. 
T - As predicted by the way the beer smelled, the grapefruit and pineapple hoppyness was dominant. Not too strong of a malty backbone. 
M - Medium-bodied. Left a strong resinous hop bite that subsided after about 30 seconds. (Good thing)
O - Overall, it is a great IPA that I would love to drink side-by-side with Heady Topper as they are so similar to one another. I would have to say that Heady Topper is better, although this beer would make a good substitute, never a replacement, however. 771 charactersGeckoPunk, Aug 12, 2012

Appearance is a cloudy orange tone with one finger of a bright white head. Its` nose has pineapple, lemons, hop resin. This a beer with a fantastic nose, perhaps a bit "dank" but nice. Moving on to the taste, there are citrus hops, good bitterness, some bread. Mouthfeel is medium with a rather dry finish which lingers for some time.

Great flavor, light malt backbone. Medium-high bitterness, good carbonation and a dry finish with no hints of booze whatsoever.
Awesome beer, VT FTW!

Head dissipates to a layer of bubbles leaving a bit of wide lacing. A good amount of fine carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass. 
Nose is amazing, sweet orange and grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, passion fruit, with just a hint of citrus peel and herbal bittering hops. Straight out of the fridge the aroma just explodes from the bottle. As it warms, there is a light caramel sweetness as well.
Taking a sip, herbal and pine bitterness upfront, mellowing to sweeter tropical papaya and pineapple flavors. A bit of grapefruit with a nice biscuit and caramel malt sweetness. Lingering herbal and citrus peel flavors on a dry finish. 
Light body with a nice soft but ample carbonation made this one of the more refreshing IPA's I've tried. I would have liked a bit more citrus in the taste but still an excellent IPA. 950 charactersnataku00, Aug 03, 2012

This beer pours a really nice peachy orange color, clean, clear with a couple of bubbles rising to the top of the glass. A nice fluffy finger of white head rests atop the beer, decent retention, a nice web of lacing left behind along with some film after the head recedes. The aroma is great, big floral notes jump out of the glass, citrus, some nice simple cereal malt. The hops are a bit soapy, but also bring out some nice coniferous notes along with some grassy earthiness. The flavors are great, follows the nose perfectly, lots of floral notes, juicy citrus, a bit of caramel sweetness from the malt, but that's really all the malt I could detect, this is a hop forward beer, plain and simple. Some tropical fruit comes out as well with some nice grassiness and pine at the finish. The body is superb, sticky, big and full, super smooth with perfect levels of carbonation. 
Verdict: Certainly one of the finest IPAs out there. Great hop profile, just enough of a malt backbone to keep some balance, great body with a great powerful aroma. Super happy to have tried this one fresh! 1,160 characterskevanb, Jul 29, 2012

Mouthfeel: Medium body and high in carbonation and very dry and bitter

Pours a clear light orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some very nice tropical fruit aromas. Taste is exactly the same and comes with a medium amount of hop bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip.

4.55/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my Alpine Pint glass. A hazy and light orange color. Plenty of tiny carbonation bubbles and some particles of yeast float about this one and lead to a small two finger head that is off white in color and thin but on the creamy side in appearance. Lace sticks quite well in a continental way.
Smell is all citrus and a bit of pine. Tangerine and a bit of blood orange or pink grapefruit. There is some malt backbone smell here too with some sweet earth.
Taste is simply amazing. A ton of citrus as in the nose but on an exponential level. A tongue lashing bitter sweet. Ultra ripe oranges meet yellow grapefruit. Malt sweetness as well. This one wrecks the palate but still keeps the malt balance there as well. Very nicely done.
Mouth is quite velvety or creamy for a DIPA. Carbonation is creamy and round especially for the style. Body is balanced and the finish is long and wet. Very well done!!
Overall I am uber impressed with this one. I am pretty sure this is at least two months old so I can only imagine this one fresh. Thanks to Pete27lax for this awesome trade. This is a must for anyone willing to call themselves a Hophead. 1,151 charactersazdback, Jul 22, 2012
4.27/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A-Pours a lightly hazed golden orange. Head is exact. Off-white and dense but still tall. This beer retains its cap perfectly. This surely looks the part; especially with the lacing it leaves.
S-Nose is piney and blatantly hop-forward. Definitely stresses the abrasive pine and grass qualities more than the tropical/fruity aspects. Grains and cracker malt. Mild caramel. Floral hoppiness too.
T-Akin to the nose. Green grass and heaps of pine. Grains back up the coercive piney flavors. You get some moderate citrus and grapefruit. Florals kick in too. Finishes quite bitter and piney. Tastes great but could use a bit more complexity.
M-Medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is dry and endlessly bitter. Resinous.
O/D-Overall, this did not live up to the hype. Nowhere near one of the best beers I have tried. It's clearly an above average Imperial IPA; but thats the ceiling for this beer. This is not in the same realm as others from the state of VT. 966 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 22, 2012

Pours a nice golden hue with a thick white head that leaves some amazing lacing. The aroma on this is galaxy, citra, and amarillo (or at least that's my best guess) - both sweet, citrusy (pineapple, grapefruit) and a solid dose of spring fir shoots. The flavors smack around and leave a bitter aftertaste that just makes me want to grab another sip - this is really a beautiful DIPA. I wish I'd been able to get more while I was at the Maple Tripple release.
After trying this I can clearly see what Lawson's is so heavily sought after; if I knew I was getting a fresh bottle I'd definitely seek this out again. Cheers! 671 charactersfvernon, Jul 15, 2012

O: Overall this is a fine DIPA that I feel can hold it's own against any other DIPA out there , It's remarkably smooth and balanced and goes down silky smooth .
Highly recommend this one .. 661 charactersInebriatedJoker, Jul 15, 2012

T: Wow... this is my new favorite DIPA (previously Heady). Grapefruit, passion fruit, Hoppy, but not much bitter, orange, very long lasting flavour. Slight bitterness towards the end but sweetness masks it quite well. Perfectly balanced hoppy goodness
M: Smoooth, but it's also got good amount of carbonation. Perfection.
O: From looks, smell, taste, to feel, this beer is near perfection. I don't think this bottle was super fresh (about 5-6 weeks old maybe), but damn it was delicious. My favorite DIPA to date. 668 characterssukwonee, Jul 13, 2012

Bottle to HF Stem

Thanks to BA Tony32408 for this one
App- More of a dark orange with a good haze to it being unfiltered. A little murky and a little heavy looking. A small one finger white head with fast receding bubbles formed and left some good lace lines, not great but was nice.
Smell- When you open the cap you get little whiffs of the citrus inside the bottle. Nice aromatics with tropical notes coming forward early. A bit of pineapple, mango and tangering. A stronger pull leaves some of the impending creamy hops and pine flavors with a little bit of the thicker booze from the 8%
Taste- This was a very balanced large abv DIPA. The 8% is there but is very well layered in between what I am going to a a lush creamy hoppy flavor intermixed with a small smidgen of pine and resin flavors. For a large DIPA, not overly dry either. The creaminess brings the flavors together very nicely.
Mouth- This really was a very good beer on the palate. A bit of a thicker medium body with a creamy hoppy and fruity residual flavor. A good amount of bubbles but more of a thicker carbonation as well.
Drink- An outstanding DIPA from VT. Becoming a trend and I like it!! I am glad I live near alpine and have access to it, because I'd go broke trading for this guy all the time. 1,304 charactersFosterJM, Jul 12, 2012

Finishes dry and strongly bitter, with an unusual astrigency felt on my inner lips.
Overall, this is not my preferred style of DIPA. I like citrusy, fruity hops and a little more sweetness. Others will undoubtedly prefer this profile and rate this higher. 535 characterskscaldef, Jul 03, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Hazy, uniform amber pour with a crown of fluffy white foam. There is excellent lacing and good head retention. The nose is purely sweet citrus fruit with a very subtle alcohol. The taste is far more intensly hoppy, almost too much at first. However, give the beer a chance to breathe and of course let that alcohol set in (/dissapate off into a warm summer breeze) and the beer changes. The sweetness comes in almost syrupy while your palate becomes quickly acclimated to the intense bitterness. Still though, it's hard to completely enjoy the grapefruit rind bitterness completely. Great beer, but it's a bit over the top. 623 charactersThePorterSorter, Jun 23, 2012

Huge thanks to lalaloveyou for trading this beer to me! Thanks Lauren! I have wanted to try this beer for a long time!
reviewed from notes on 6/15/12.
poured into duvel tulip.
Appearance: Golden yellow bodied beer with big 2 fingers of white head. Nice lacing on the side of the glass.
Smell: Really citrusy. Tons of oranges and tagerines. Some grapefruit and pineapple. Buttermilk biscuits and cracker like malts. 
Taste: moderate bitterness. The orange, lemon zest, and mangos are really big in the hop profile of this beer. Its crazy and I like it! Pineapple and a hint of resinous pine complete this hop profile. Hops are mostly citrusy / fruity and a malts add a touch of bready sweetness to the mix. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. This beer is so damn drinkable. With a light and dry finish that screams awesomeness!
Overall: This is a really awesome brew that really lives the hype. Great taste and balance; really a fantastic brew by lawsons! This is my second Lawson beer and this one did not dissapoint! 1,061 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jun 21, 2012

Acquired via trade
Thanks, whartontallboy!
Hazy, unfiltered, somewhat murky orange with a moderately sized off-white head. This leaves the glass astonishingly messy on the way down. Perhaps the best lacing I've seen in a DIPA. Gorgeous.
Big citrus and tropical fruit aromas are most notable, a mild pine presence, and a very little sweetness.
The flavor is absolutely delicious, complete, quenching: superb. The tropical and citrus flavors are the most present, along with a moderate bitterness, light pine, and just a hint/presence of sweet malt. Simply perfect. The lingering citrus presence is stunning. This may be the finest DIPA in the world.
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Crisp, though slightly sticky.
Perfect. 749 charactersehammond1, Jun 18, 2012

pours a burnished gold tone with a touch of haze, yields a nice creamy head with good retention and lacing evident. nose is wonderfully aromatic, delivering a big hoppy bouquet of citrus and tropical fruits, with secondary notes of malt and pine. outstanding aroma.
more of the same delivered in the flavor. lot of tropical/citric goodness with just enough balancing malt. very, very nicely done. i think it compares well with FW double jack, one of my current favorite DIPAs. medium-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation.
overall, very nicely done. lawson's has impressed the hell out of me, though doing so seems to come easily for them. if we could just ramp up the production a bit and get some ditributed to MA...

4.6/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Consumed 6/14/12
Appearance: A bit hazy, bright golden orange - pours with a moderately big, white head, retains a small cap - impressive lacing, spots and streaks everywhere
Smell: Nicely dank - tons of citrus and tons of resinous pine - tropical citrus, with some mango and wet pineapple - oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines - juicy, fleshy, and pithy - wet, sticky, resiny pine - a faint touch of weed, green onions, and herbs - biscuity, slightly toasted, slightly earthy malts underneath
Taste: Gloriously hoppy, with a number of things going on - sweet mango and pineapple - grapefruit flesh and rind, with tangerines - sticky pine - aggressive and bitter, with a lingering pithy bitterness - malts are a bit sweet, made sweeter with touches of tropical fruit - toasted biscuits, and some grains, slightly earthy - definitely not balanced, but it's actually pretty drinkable - alcohol is slightly detectable
Mouthfeel: Medium body, nicely carbonated, mostly dry, but with an oily and sticky aftertaste
Overall: Masterful, greater than the sum of its parts
I realize it's stupid to make the following comparison, but I'm doing it anyway. This beer kind of tastes like a lovechild between Heady Topper and Dreadnaught. It's very aggressive, yet very East Coast. Regardless, this is easily one of Lawson's Finest. Cheers to the ladies at Craft Beer Cellar for getting Mr. Lawson himself to do a tasting on 6/2/12. Good times. 1,436 charactersangrybabboon, Jun 14, 2012

Smell: Loads of citrus. Deep resinous pine notes. Hints of mango and pineapple. Slightly herbal with a backing earthiness. Malts are present add a nice sweetness to the whole thing. Loads of pith and grapefruit flesh. Loads going on here. A touch of biscuity malt rides through the background. Something akin to cotton candy. A touch floral. It's all there and then some. Nicely balanced on the hop profile.
Taste: Big hop punch. Mango and pine layered over a big pithy grapefruit flesh hybrid. Sticky and resinous with a nice hit of floral sweetness in the back. Malts are big as well, but pale against the hops. Slightly biscuity with a solid sweetness that helps cut back on some of the bitterness. Mega pine. Slightly dank and earthy. Herbal backing. Beastly.
Mouthfeel: Medium body that pushes toward full. Big and oily with a lingering dryness on the back of things. Carbonation is solid and helps spread the life. Mega oily and slick.
Overall: It's as good as people say. Loads of flavor, but it never gets tiring. A bit more aggressive than others of the ilk (I'm looking at you Pliny and Heady Topper), but it's carried off with East coast flair. If you can track it down, do it. It's bottled happiness. 1,391 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jun 05, 2012

Crystal clear pour with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing, this looks gorgeous. And the nose is fuckamazing. Big, resiny, citrus and pine goodness, incredibly bright, resiny, fruity but decidedly bitter, Pretty much perfect for a DIPA, the only reason I haven't bumped the score is 'cos I tried it at a tasting. The palate follows, with a burst of hop goodness, big, bitter, bright, pungent and resiny, with citrus and pine with no real malt character to speak of. Dense, hop resins linger on in the finish, coating the palate and emphasizing some of the fruity aspects of the beer. Drying, bitter finish, this is awesome. Very highly recommended. Fuck yeah!
**Edit 21 July 2012**
Thanks again, Michael.
Looks great, this smells great too! An amazing, juicy, fruity tropical fruit nose with mango, papaya, peach and tangerine, this is just bursting with hop goodness. Bright and pungent without being grassy and herbal, the hop nose is close to perfect. 
The palate is an explosion of hops, big, fruity, sweet and amazing. Tangerine, mango, melon, nectarines, peach and ripe oranges run riot on the palate. Bitterness is low here, but there is an oily, resiny hop character that more than makes up for it. The hops are so juicy that they make this beer sweet, a feat considering that the base pale malt lends nothing more than a mild biscuit note. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this feels pretty great on the palate. While I'm tempted to lump this in with the San Diego DIPAs, this still is unique in the hop profile. It amplifies the fruity hop nose that the best ones have, and tones down the bitterness for a very unique beer, and while my scores stand, my palate was clearly compromised when I wrote my original review above. Clean, fruity and refreshing, this is outstanding stuff. 1,934 charactersDefenCorps, Jun 01, 2012

4.7/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Upon drinking this on tap at the Farmhouse in Burlington it struck me, not for the first time, that when beer is of this quality it’s merely taste which determines how one will rank it and where it should be put in our personal pantheon of any particular style. I was lucky enough to have this side by side with Hill Farmstead’s Abner and later that day, a very fresh can of Heady Topper. I’ve had Pliny and Blind Pig and multiple Alpine IPA’s, Surly’s Abrasive and Furious, and Double Sunshine was likely my favorite of all of them. They’re all phenomenal but on this particular day at least, I was completely blown away by how good this was. 
The beer is very slightly hazy and golden with a fluffy white head that settles down slowly, leaving nice lacing on the glass. The aroma bursts up at you, with fresh and extremely vivid tropical fruit and citrus as well as some floral and resinous pine notes. A faint hint of sweet maltiness is also detected. The flavor is simply delicious, with the malt just propping the hops up ever so slightly with a subtle caramel taste and never intruding. Complex fruity hops dominate, with lots of grapefruit, orange, lemon, pineapple, etc. Piney notes also come into play. Bitterness is very moderate and while present doesn’t overshadow the hop details.
Medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a very smooth overall feel. Alcohol is undetected and the finish lingers quite pleasantly, with all those hop subtleties hanging around. Again, this one is at least as good as anything hoppy I’ve ever tried. 1,564 characterstobelerone, May 30, 2012

Poured from bomber into dimpled glass mug. Pours hazy orange with a beautiful thick white head that dissipates into thin lacing that lasts very well throughout. Aromas of sweet floral citrus, pineapple, and herbal hops. Sweet floral-like malts come out very well in the flavor along with some mango and pineapple. There is some dryness and delicious hop bitterness in the finish. A very pleasant DIPA and an excellent example for the style! Glad to have tried this one out. 665 charactersCuriousMonk, May 29, 2012

This beer pours a cloudy and bright tangerine orange in color with a two finger, bright white head. The nose is extremely fresh and full of pineapple and that trademark Smcoe aroma. Despite that, it's pretty fruit forward as far as the hops are concerned with a touch of pine. It's very aromatic. The flavors are dry and fruity, very fresh with loads of fresh hop presence. It drinks slightly bitter and slightly dry. The malt bill is lighter, helping drinkability. The alcohol isn't present either. Overall this is a really, really nice DIPA. I'm grateful I could try it, and so fresh. 679 charactersaasher, May 26, 2012

4/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip.
Out of the bottle, my pour is a golden sunshine color with a generous white cap. A bit of sticky lace clings to my glass as I work my way through it.
The aroma is hop forward. Grassy, herbal, with grapefruit, some tropical fruits, and a bit of pine.
Up front a little bit of sweet caramel malt hangs on for a little while, providing a balance that I don't need in my DIPA's. Grapefruit, mango, peach, tangerine, and apricot all provide a strong fruit presence, which overlays a generally grassy bitterness. The malt maintains a bit of sweetness and a chewy breadiness throughout.
The carbonation is creamy and on the full side. Although there is a grainy nature to the beer itself, it also has a smoothness about it. There is no real alcohol presence noticeable in the taste. The bitterness grows with each sip, but there is not an overwhelming aftertaste or anything.
This is definitely a solid beer, but I was not as blown away by it as many other people have been. This is a mystery that may only be resolved with a follow up tasting. 1,096 charactersKickInTheChalice, May 16, 2012

Appearance - Pours a hazy orange body with almost no head on a careful pour. Good lacing, but not much of a head to retain.
Smell - Smells wonderful. Citrus, as every great IPA has, but it's got a good dose of pine and herbal simcoe flavors. Complex and wonderful aroma. Smells a bit sweet.
Taste - Just a hint of sweetness at the start and then a wave of hops. Citrus mainly, with a piney finish that blends with the herbal character. The herbal notes linger in the finish. Strong bitter finish.
Mouthfeel - It's crisp and clean, but the bitter finish is really strong. It's a little detracting. It probably helps the flavor retain a nice complexity, but it makes it less gulpable than I'd like.
Overall - Definitely one of the top IPAs out there. The hop character is amazing. It's not just a citrus bomb. It's got a fascinating flavor profile to back up the delicious citrus hops. Awesome beer. 1,026 charactersAlieniloquium, May 04, 2012

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewing the Double Sunshine IPA from Lawson's Finest Liquids out of Vermont. This is one of the most sought after IPA in the county, along with Heady Topper, and it is not easy to get a hold of if you do not live near the three places that sell Lawson's beer. This is my first Lawson's beer and I am very excited to try it.
Score: 100
No bottle date, but this once was received via trade on 04/05/12 and purchased towards the end of March. Served in a Half Acre tulip and enjoyed on 04/09/12.
Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy and pretty translucent golden orange color. Three fingers of off-white soapy head at pour slowly settles into a thin bubbly layer. Excellent lacing, good retention. 5/5
Smell: Tons of mango, pineapple and bright tropical citrus upfront. Peach, apricot, and lots of fresh, sweet grapefruit. A modest dose of pine. There's a sugary/candied tropical fruit aroma to this. 5/5
Taste: Fresh, sweet and sticky tropical citrus upfront quickly followed by a strongly bitter hops oil flavor on the midpalate and in the finish. Grapefruit, pineapple juice, peach and mango. A little bit of pulpy orange as the beer layers. There's a really nice piney hop kick in the finish. This beer takes you to the extreme of sweet and juicy citrus IPA flavor and reels you back with a deliciously bitter hop bite. Gets even better and more balanced as the beer layers. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium-plus carbonation that simultaneously perks the hops on the palate and lets the bitterness sit heavy. Really nice and oily mouthfeel. Dry, bitter finish. 5/5
Overall: Pitch perfect DIPA. Loads of juicy tropical citrus and bitter pine balance to boot. This one smells and tastes just as good as Abrasive Ale.
Recommendation: Seek this beer out. Assuming you like IPA's, this is one of the absolute best in the style that you will ever have the opportunity to try.
Pairings: Goose Island's "Black Earth Burger" would be perfect with this.
Cost: $10 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle that really looks like a 750 ml. 2,027 charactersjegross2, May 01, 2012

Right up front a great mix of peach, pine, and citrus. Bitterness pops up in the middle and drys out quite nicely. The dryness carries on after the finish. Left with a touch of pine, candied orange, and a mild floral aftertaste. 
The bitterness is so incredibly balanced here. It hits just right. The taste and feel are absolutely killer. This beer definitely brings some 'Sunshine' to the nose and palate. World Class IPA for sure.

The taste starts out with a full heavy dose of hops, with lots of pine with a hint of citrus zest. The finish is dry, crisp, and smooth.

Pours hazy sunshine gold with a good amount of sediment floating about. Capped with a two finger head of tight white foam. An attractive crown of white lace.
Bright tropical citrus, mangoes and papaya. Bright herbal tones as well. Floral and sublime not many beers can pull off an aroma like this.
Cracker light malt, uplifting and compliments the bright grapefruit pith and tropical fruits. Bitterness is creeping but hits at the end with a drying sensation. Alcohol on the end as well but delicious.
Texture is luxurious, smooth and clean despite the haze. Medium bodied and dries very well. 
A fantastic DIPA rich in tropical hops, bright and so drinkable. Artful craftsmanship that you can sense at all corners. A great experience and a brew to be savored. 831 charactersrawfish, Apr 04, 2012

Pours a hazy orange color with a creamy white one finger head. Suds stick around for a bit before fading off to patchy bubbles. Good and sticky looking with a fair amount of lacing.
The aroma is amazing with an intense blast of citrus fruit. First up is grapefruit and lemon followed by oranges, tangerines and a light smell of pine. The nose is full of hops from the start right to the finish.
The taste comes on strong once again bringing on the citrus flavors. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon it's all there draped over a near perfect balance of sweetness. Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for the abv. Finishes clean and delicious.
The mouthfeel definitely stands up to a double with a medium body and not overly carbonated. A zesty feel through out followed by a delicate bitterness and ending somewhat dry and resinous. 
Overall this beer has some amazing qualities (aroma in particular) and was a real treat to experience. Somewhat of a bitch to get a hold of but well worth the effort and price. I have several other styles from Lawson's I grabbed and can't wait to open them up. Add this one to an ever growing list of fantastic IPA/DIPAS coming out of Vermont. Nice job!! 1,316 characters05Harley, Apr 01, 2012
4.65/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on tap at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, VT recently. 
The appearance is nearly a lemon yellow color, hazy and unfiltered. beautiful white head. It looks like bright sunshine.
The nose is loaded with citrus notes. HUGE citrus. Lemon, grapefruit, and even a hint of orange and lime perhaps? 
This is a unique and delicious DIPA. The flavor is huge on citrus and well hopped throughout. You get this bright, citrus bitter hop profile with some pine and lemongrass notes that lingers and transitions into a slightly sweet, slightly sour, slightly dry, bitter finish. The finish stands out the most to me as unique for this style. Like fresh lemon zest and orange peel with great citrus, sour/sweet bitterness to send the taste out with a bang and leave you wanting more. Well balanced for my taste. Abv not noticeable and Malt stays out of the way and let the hops shine. 
Mouthfeel is great! Zesty with moderate/strong carbonation throughout... a little creamy towards the middle and then bitter/sweet/sour at the finish. 
Overall another fantastic DIPA coming out of vermont. I'm looking forward to trying more of Lawson's hoppy beers as this one is delicious and unique for the style. It really stands out to me. Try it! 1,237 charactersdurrrr, Mar 31, 2012

Aroma on this baby is incredible! Fresh, juicy citrus comes through nearly as strongly as the hop profile. Kept some in my glass for awhile just to keep smelling it. Can't get enough of this aroma!
Taste is about the same as I remembered from the bottle. My 4oz pour isn't getting much attention though, as I definitely prefer the draft pour of Heady Topper sitting next to it.
All in all, Double Sunshine is a solid West Coast DIPA from the Vermont crew. 608 charactersbrystmar, Mar 29, 2012

Pours a hazy golden orange with a small wispy white head that recedes to a swirl of foam and thick collar.
Aroma is massively hoppy with mostly juicy citrus hops - pithy white grapefruit and orange zest. Some lemongrass and pien resin underneath the citrus. There is a bit of bready malt sweetness but definitely not a lot of balance in the nose.
The taste has a mix of oranges and pineapple citrus with a hefty floral dankness with some herbal and grassy notes. The finish is bitter and resinous.
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodiied and well carbonated. I do get a hint of alcohol burn in the finish which surprised me a little but didn't take away from the beer.
Another outstanding hoppy beer from Lawson's. I was a big fan of the Triple Play I just tasted and this is even better I think. 823 charactersgford217, Mar 26, 2012

 This beer pours a cloudy neon orange. Large head quickly settles to form an uneven layer on the beer. Thick lacing all down the glass.
 The smell, seriously....this smell of HUGE citrus. I could sniff this ALL day long.
 Taste is wonderful; sweet and bitter all at once. There is a nice fresh hop oil presence. Big and bold, this is not subtle....but it isn't brash. It's big and bold in the best way possible. This shit is off the hizzle!! 
 My mouth is in heaven. When a take a big mouthful of this sexy woman in my mouth I want to leave her linger there, savoring the silky feel of her. Thick and full, this beer hits the mark.

Opaque orange amber color that poured with a large white head. There's little lacing in the glass and no visible signs of carbonation.
The nose is subtle all around: large citrus fruit and lightly sweet malts.
The flavor is fantastic. Very well balanced with very little alcohol presence. Somewhat similar to the nose, there's first light citrus flavor followed by hop bitterness. The bitterness lingers but is then accompanied by subtle sweet malts. The bitterness is not overpowering, but just makes itself known.
The feel is medium to light and there's not much carbonation.
This is a very enjoyable DIPA. The balance and subtleties are well respected. 691 charactersTotallyHosed, Mar 22, 2012

The aroma is loaded with citrus. Orange and grapefruit with a touch of lemon. Some tropical fruits are also present.
Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is creamy and smooth with effervescent carbonation. The flavor is loaded with orange and grapefruit citrus, tropical fruit (mango, apricot, pineapple), and a touch of grass. Some caramel malt sweetness makes a brief appearance. It finishes dry, moderately bitter and tart. Once gone the grapefruit citrus and grassy bitterness lingers on the palate.
Wow! Super tasty, easy drinking Imperial IPA. Reminds me of Heady Topper, just not as bitter. Creamy mouth feel and light carbonation feels wonderful on the palate. 859 charactersWanderingFool, Mar 20, 2012

Appearance- Pours a light yellowish orange with a big beautiful one finger bright white head (even with a gentle pour). A beautiful cap and collar are maintained the entire beer along with tons of lacing.
Smell- Oh balls, they hit this out of the park. It’s got those super dank, almost raw, hoppy tones that I’ve only ever gotten from opening a vacuum pack sealed bag of hops and Surly Abrasive. Plenty of light lemony pine along with hints of peaches and pineapple. I get more of a citrusy fruit in the nose than anything else. Awesome stuff.
Taste- Not near as potent as the nose would suggest but absolutely delicious. Starts with a ton of orange peel and grapefruit. A touch of mango peeks in along with some grassy papaya. I do get a teeny tiny bit of burnt sugar in the finish but it’s fleeting. I get a fair amount of grassy earthiness that lingers into the finish.
Mouthfeel- My only real beef with the beer (all be it minor). It’s fairly light bodied but it’s got a great snap of crisp carbonation. Like I said, minor.
Drinkability- This is a great beer. Honestly, might be the best smelling beer I’ve ever had the pleasure of drinking. It’s crazy how insane the beer smells yet the taste is pretty tame and balanced in comparison. Between this and Heady Topper I’d say two of the best West Coast beers in America are made on the East Coast. Thanks Adam! 1,572 charactersyounger35, Mar 07, 2012

S: Tropical: grapefruit, tangerine, melon, pine.

M: Very approachable and forgiving for being such a hoppy beer. Carbonation is PERFECT. 
O: My first thought upon opening, smelling, and taking the first sip was "wow this is the perfect (d)ipa)" and better than any hill farmstead ones. As I drank through my 1/2, I began to think that it was only better than some and rivaled their best. Reminiscing, I can't say that this is better than Ephraim batch 2.

A- Looks like drinkable sunshine. Very light in color, hazy with a 1+ finger head and good lacing. It's beautiful.
S- Peach, lemon and mango along with other general tropical fruit. Super fruity and enjoyable. I love this style of DIPA.
T- Sweet, fruit juicy hops with not a whole lot of bitterness. More of what the nose has, but to a lesser degree. 
M- Maybe the best part of this beer. Probably the smoothest DIPA I've had to date. It's perfect. Still a little enjoyable stickiness on the lips.
O- A really great DIPA, I wish I could have gotten more than one bottle of this when I was in VT. Is it as good as HT? Not in my opinion, but it's very different and it's definitely in the top tier among the tropical/citrus heavy DIPAs that I've tasted. 894 characterstyamhydrogen, Feb 25, 2012

Pours a hazy golden sunshine color with an inch or so of white foam that eventually settles to a thin cap and collar, leaving some nice spotty lace behind. Really gorgeously bright yellow, definitely get the Sunshine aspect they were going for here.
Aromas begin quite dank, with some lemon rind, blood orange juice, tropical fruits and a slight floral hops as well. A light pale sugary malt character emerges as it warms. 
The tastes are dominated by blood orange, grapefruit, cirus rind, pineapple and a minimal sweet pale malt backbone. Alcohol is non-existent, but I wouldn't expect much from an 8% beer. Initially restrained in bitterness, although it mounts over the course of a glass.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, smooth texture, dry finish and light residual resins. No alcohol warmth.
Overall this is just an all-around great beer. My first Lawson's beer and hopefully not my last. Really lots of citrus juice and rind flavor. I think this may be a couple or even several months old so he aromas may not have been as fresh as possible; still awesome, just not in the upper echelon of DIPAs. Lots of blood orange and tropical fruit flavors. Highly recommended and well worth seeking out if it can be obtained fresh. 1,319 charactersclaspada, Feb 19, 2012

A - Pours murky golden orange with a nice one finger tall white head leaving light rings of lace down the glass. I got the last of the bottle so mine was a little murkier than the others.
S - Smells of pungent grapefruits, citric hops, fresh pine needles and a growing caramel sweetness. I would say that the nose is the best part of this beer.
T - Starts off with a nice citric hop punch quickly giving way to hints of pine resin, sweet caramel malt, fresh cut grass and some light citric fruit. The fruit and hops are fading quick but there is still plenty there to carry this one to the finish. Finish is pretty dry, lingering for some time.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Smooth, hoppy feel leaving the pallet dry, as it should, long after the finish.
O - I am pretty sure this one was around two weeks old and it was pretty good. The taste was a bit of a letdown from the nose but it was still very easy to drink and it packs lots of flavor. Can't wait for my next run in with this one. 1,166 charactersorangesol, Feb 17, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522 oz. gold foiled and capped bottle courtesy of AshleyMiller, my newest partner in crime as I redescend in to the world of trading madness after picking up some ammunition at the annual Southampton RIS release. This one was enjoyed on a Friday evening at a hotel in Alexandria where I was staying on business, and poured in to a snifter I happened to bring along with me. 
Appearance: Double Sunshine, indeed. This one pours a radiant, vivid golden, a really breathtaking honey orange hue that's completely opaque to even direct light with hop proteins. It's only transparent around the very edges, where distanced streams of steady but slow and fine carbonation bubble slowly upwards to the surface. That surface - initially capped with a finger and a half of nearly perfectly alabaster head - showcases a persistent dusting after the initial mountain has crumbled (which did take some time), leaving huge and crunchy swaths of frosty lacing in its wake. A very attractive color and great lacing - if the head retention had been a little better, it'd have been a perfect 5.0.
Aroma: An amazing bouquet, and one of the closest drinking experiences to literally walking through a ripe hop field and burying your face in a cluster as I've had. Fresh, dank, fat hop notes, absolutely bursting with aromaticity, from spicy herbal notes to bright, crisp piney to sweet, airy, and robust citrus notes. The citrus is what's strong up front initially, but - as this one warms, and the heavier esters and notes begin to rise - it gets more resinous, spicy, piney, herbal, filled with leather and tobacco and tar. 
Taste: Oddly and mildly disappointingly, this may this beer's weakest aspect. That's not to say it's bad - it's not, at all, and in fact it's quite good - but compared to the glory of the nose, the arcing gorgeousness of the lacing, and the amazing mouth, the complexities of the hop profile here just don't do it for me.
That's also not to say that the hop profile isn't complex: it is. This one is fat with resin, running the gamut of possible hop notes: citrusy, grassy, herbal, piney, floral, and, naturally, plenty of bitterness. The citrus dominates up front, suggesting lemon and grapefruit most obviously, but also hinting at other tropical relations, but takes on that earthy rind quality because of all the dank, resinous, leafy and herbal notes present as well. Piney notes linger long past the last drop leaves your mouth, amplifying that dry, minerally bitterness that the best dryer IPAs and DIPAs have in spades, though that isn't what this one's all about.
Though I would say it errs on the side of dryness. The malt backbone is moderately roasted, characteristic of the hue, with biscuity and heavier honey notes dominating the attempt at balance. Though there's definitely some hints of caramel and cookie sweetness here, the whole thing leans more towards the spicy, dryer, crispier side of things, which is to its credit, showcasing the hops nicely without being so dry as to render the experience an all out assault.
Mouthfeel: One of the smoothest, creamiest DIPAs I've ever laid lips too. Like whipped air, the carbonation levels - in conjunction with the stickiness of the body - hit that real sweet spot, with enough lift that it floats over the tongue but not enough that it jumps off. Like drinking velvet. Bitter, bitter velvet.
Drinkability: Is Vermont the new California of the east coast, or something? I'm not sure, but there are a slew of good IPAs and DIPAs coming out of there recently. This one was near-fantastic, but instead I'll just call it "great." At 8.0%, it's also eminently manageable, hitting that sweet spot near the top of the flavor:alcohol ratio chart, much like PtE. This beer reminds me a lot of a slightly haughtier, danker PtE, in many ways, and I'd like to do a side by side. As it stands, I highly recommend this one, and would snatch it up should I ever be so lucky as to see it again. 3,955 charactersCrellMoset, Feb 11, 2012

Pours a light orange with a 1.5 finger white head leaving excellent retention.
Aroma is wonderfully hoppy. An underlying pine and a deep whiff of pineapple along with melon and passion fruit. Just a touch of caramel sweetness and honey.
Flavor starts off with big juicy hops. Some pineapple, pine and grapefruit burst out of the gate. Just a touch of bready sweetness in the middle before ending with a pine/grapefruit big bitterness and dry.
Medium mouthfeel and carb. A little sticky but still finishes dry. Amazing.
This is my oldest want according to my list and glad I finally got to try it as it lived up to what I thought it would be. Wonderfully complex all out hop assault and went down way too smooth. I'll definitely play nice with Vermont traders for another crack at this one. 834 charactersjmarsh123, Feb 09, 2012

A - Hazy golden-orange with a two-finger head. Incredible retention and lacing that sticks in big clumps for days. Gorgeous.
S - Pine and grapefruit hops balanced perfectly with caramel sweetness. The aroma is up there with Pliny, no doubt. Very west coast -- hop forward, favoring the tropical fruits but balanced with pine.
T - Bitter hops up front, with grapefruit and pine flavors. Transition into a honey and caramel sweetness finishing with a dry toasted grain. This beer is impossibly tasty. Everything I look for in an IPA and more.
M - Medium in body. Perfect degree of dryness in the finish. Starts out a bit sharp from the carbonation and bitterness and this doesn't quite go away.
O - One of the best IPAs I have ever had, without a doubt. Deserves the reputation as one of the best. This beer balances bitter and sweet perfectly and incorporates many complimenting flavors with a body that matches it well. I was floored.
EDIT: Drinking Pliny today Feb 20... These beers are very similar, particularly in Taste. Amazing beer, this. 1,094 charactersgreenmonstah, Feb 05, 2012

A - Mildly-hazy, golden-orange with a fluffy off-white head with moderate lacing. 
S - Wonderful. Everything you could hope for with tropical, citrus, hop floral and a light touch of pine. Not dank.
T - Wow. Perfect. Hop forward bitterness, orange and pineapple flesh, lighter touch of mango and sweet pineapple, pale malt, citric zest bitterness. Dries nicely and leaves a to-die-for bright and bitter aftertaste.
M - Medium body and the right amount of carbonation. Smooth and full-bodied. Really nice.

A- Double Sunshine is a bright yellow/gold tinted color with some orange spots within.There was only a mere skim of foam on the top, leaving minimal lace.
S- Big citrus up front with nice grapefruit and a bit of orange. A big hoppy nose with the malt not really making a whimper. Getting some pine as well with a bitter smell as it opens up.
T- Great stuff. The hops literally take charge and give off a huge citrus blast on the tounge. This includes grapefruit. Pines are up front as well but to a lesser extent. Pale malt to give off a balance but dont really come through in the taste. This is bitter all around.
M- Basically medium in feel with a nice crisp carb addition. After a while the bitterness really got to me though, in a good way. On second thoughts the body is less than medium, the liquid goes down real easy like
D- A nice ABV not to high. This is a hop bomb and nicely balanced. It's nice to see that East Coast brewers can do them California style IPA'S just as well. 1,020 charactersBARFLYB, Jan 29, 2012
4.25/5  rDev -7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Double Sunshine has a body that is somewhere between yellow and orange; it is a fairly light color for a IIPA. The off-white head is quite solid looking, and the retention is very good. Thick rings of lacing remain on the side of my glass from its top to its bottom.
The aroma is aggressively hoppy, with tons of pine and citrus. There isn't a lot of malt hanging around in this aroma.
The hops dominate Double Sunshine. Pine is the single biggest flavor, and it comes through in the flavor profile immediately, along with a bunch of bitterness. Resin and leafy hop flavors also play a roll, but less so than the pine or the citrus that follows the pine. The citrus flavors are also quite powerful, as well as bright and juicy. Grapefruit is the main citrus flavor, but a little bit of orange comes through as well. The malt barely makes a contribution, with just a hint of bread coming through toward the end. A hint of warmth and a bite of bitterness finish things off.
Oily and bitter, the body and carbonation are well-done.
Double Sunshine is a well-made IIPA that is definitely on the bitter and hoppy end of the spectrum, which I like. 1,146 charactersHojaminbag, Jan 29, 2012

Light orange color with slight haze. 1 finger head from a fairly aggressive pour, dies down quickly to leave a few streaks of head and lacing. 
Nice citrus and shortbread smell, not very pronounced compared to the taste to come. Big grapefruit taste with some pine and tropical fruits. A bit of malt sweetness sneaks through toward the front end, but quickly gives way to a very astringent bitterness. I was put off by this at first (and I generally am a big hop head). So it took a while to finish my glass. Interestingly, as the beer came closer to room temperature, the bitterness mellowed and the flavors seemed much more in balance.
Juicy medium body. A little heavy - could use a bit more carbonation to lighten things up.
Overall a nice DIPA. I would try this one again. 870 charactersCliffBrake, Jan 28, 2012

The aroma shows a lot of juicy, tropical fruit notes to it. I get some peach, pineapple and mango all coming out in it along with a little bitter grapefruit. Fantastic juicy, hoppy aroma to it overall. 
The taste has a little more of a citrus rind bitterness coming out and mixing with the juicy, tropical like fruits. I get more of peach and pineapple juice sweetness up front with a little more citrus rind, grapefruit bitterness starting to come out towards the finish. Great flavors to it overall, very juicy and fresh tasting.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it was a great beer with some excellent hoppy flavors to it. It balanced the sweet, juicy, tropical notes with some bitter, resiny hop flavors very well. Very drinkable and flavorful beer. 997 charactersbillab914, Jan 24, 2012

A. Pours a slightly cloudy goldenrod. About a finger of crisp offwhite head dissipates rapidly to a quarter finger ring. Some solid lacing on the glass. Love the look on this. Light for a DIPA. 
S. A damn tropical rainforest here. Loads of pineapple, mango, orange, grapefruit, and some dank grassiness. Wow. Phenomenal bouquet here. 
T. A lot more malt and sweetness on this than the nose let on. A sweet, sticky hop bomb. Very well-balanced. Loads of sweet malt here really tame the hops. It is definitely a DIPA, and a bit of a bruiser at that. But booze is kept in check. Drinks smooth and delightful. 
M. Very good. Bitterness and sweetness are balanced damn near perfectly. Pretty aggressively carbonated, but serves it well. 
Tropical fruits, sweet malt, and pine resin are integrated very well. 
O. One of the finest DIPAs I have ever had. Incredibly balanced at this intensity. Lots of tropical fruit and a very strong malt presence to back up the hops. Quite mellow and highly enjoyable. Must try. 1,054 characterssiege06nd, Jan 22, 2012

A- Pours a light gold with a two finger head that dissipates quickly leaving some spots of lacing behind. Fairly light for a DIPA, but the color does match the name well.
S- Right after opening the cap, the aroma of a pungent tropical fruit salad is noticeable within feet of the bottle with guava, passion fruit, mango, peach, lemon zest, some pine resin, fresh cut grass, fresh flowers and just the tiniest bit of caramel malt, though it struggles to make itself noticed.
T- Tropical fruit emerge first with guava, passion fruit, mango, peach, pineapple and lemon followed by orange pith, pine resin, grass, and a hint of a caramel malt.
M- Low to medium carbonation with a medium body and a oily mouthfeel. The bitterness lingers on at the finish, but isn't overpowering by any means. One of the longest aftertastes I’ve had in a beer.
O- Overall, this is a fantastic and unique IPA that lives up to its hype and competes with the best DIPAs. A really nice tropical fruit presence with a dry finish that isn’t overly bitter. Hope to have again in the future.

Appearance – Pours a hazy golden color into a tulip. About ¾ of slight off white head is achieved with a moderate pour, which dissipates somewhat fast leaving slight lacing.
Smell – The smell is intoxicating. I poured the beer and have been letting it slowly warm up just a bit. As it sits here in front of me, a couple feet away, the aromas are still extremely strong. Heavy pine resin and piney hops, a tropical citrus aroma mixed with pineapple and grapefruit. Slight floral notes, and just a bit of caramel.
Taste – “relief” After the first sip I know this is not an inappropriately hyped beer due to bottle count/difficulty of obtaining it. This is an extremely balanced beer, in that there is a definite biting bitterness from the hops mixed in with the pine, but then a wave of tropical and citrus notes burst through midway. Then the beer finishes up with a slight malty backbone. While PtE is very pine/bitter hop forward, and Sculpin is more tropical forward, and 90min is just a malty mess...this beer seems to combine all three of those making it a very enjoyable and tasty treat. [edit] The more the beer warms, some floral notes shine through adding to the complexity of this beer.
Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, creamy/oily slick mouthfeel, decent carbonation (a bit lower than I’d like).
Overall – A superbly crafted beer. This really does the East Coast justice and gives many top ranked West Coast D/IPA’s a run for their money. Slight alcohol warmth, but other than that, dangerously drinkable. I share many of my beers with friends and family, but I will say I am thankful I was greedy this time and have the whole bottle to myself. A very good beer. 1,800 charactersSpdKilz, Jan 12, 2012

22oz. bottle with foil top.
Poured into oversized Duvel snifter so I can get my nose into it and inhale the citrus love.
A- Poured out a beautiful golden hue that became clear enough to read the label through the other side of my glass. Amazing for an unfiltered brew. Well done.
S- Citrus explosion... juicy juicy juicy... yum. Tropical notes...grapefruit... yum
T- Amazing... this is what I crave in an IPA. Great flavor profile... hoppy and well balanced. Crisp and refreshing.
M- Light bodied and incredibly light on the tongue. Carbonation is right on the money.
O- I've had most of the others in the top 10 DIPA's...( Pliny E and Y, Heady Topper etc) and I gotta say-- Double Sunshine is top notch. Lawson really knocks it out of the park with this one. Can't wait until I get back to VT. and get more. 858 charactersHopstamon, Jan 11, 2012

Due to the high price paid, I am nervous. Uncapped with very little exhaust...now I am very worried. Poured from the bottle into a 22.5oz Libbey Citation snifter (Model# 8409)
A- Pours a beautiful, hazy golden but with only about 1/8" head. Based on other reviews announcing copious head, I am thinking this bottle suffered a leaky cap...very unhappy.
S- A swirl to build some additional head revealed a party of citrus floral and pine...absolutely perfect, 5.0. The Alchemist's Heady Topper is brought to mind.
T- The first sip revealed a delightful and well-balanced dance on the taste buds...the epitome of a hop lovers dream supported by a wonderful malt backbone. All the flavors anticipated by the aroma were represented with a lingering hop essence in the olfactory zones.
M- Low to moderate carbonation (again, the cap didn't look healthy and even took a picture before uncorking) suffered an epic experience of this brew. I am just happy that I didn't wait any longer than I did to enjoy this specimen.
I am proud, not only to have experienced a Lawson's Finest Liquid, but I am thankful the Double Sunshine was my first. Due to the cap issue, I would like to try it again, but not likely due to the investment. The enigmatic brewing talents of Sean Lawson are legendary and live on! 1,401 charactersthreeviews, Jan 07, 2012

Pours like carbonated pineapple juice. Bubbles are soapy and chunky atop a clouded base. 
Smells nicely of tropical fruits a bit of sweet and sticky and a light pine bitterness. Soft, ripe, and inviting.
This is absolutely delicious: very, very, juicy and fresh. White fleshy nectarine, firm yellow cherries, and soft grassy bitterness that leaves a firm tingle but does not overwhelm any of the aforementioned deliciousness.
Mouthfeel is odd. Drinks almost like carbonated nectar. Alcohol, while low for a DIPA, is still nearly non existent.
I have no idea how much this bottle cost and I don't care. It's worth it. An absolute pleasure and a beer that I not only am thrilled to have tried, but would love the opportunity to drink again. 894 charactersBarrytheBear, Dec 14, 2011

Looks golden with a hint of amber in it, enticing to say the least. Not much head at all, even with an aggressive pour.
Smells like...tropical fruit. Very good smell. I sit here hoping that the taste will follow suit!
Taste does indeed follow the smell well. Tropical fruit, bitter hops, absolutely no alcohol presence which is solid for an 8%. Enjoyable!
Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is there and the bitterness from the hops is present but no overpowering. Good aftertaste too. Almost like chewing a bit of juicy fruit gum, except not quite as intense and sugary, obviously!

A surprise extra that landed on my porch earlier this afternoon, and something I have been wanting to try since I heard of it. Pours from bottle into Brooklyn tulip. Pours a cloudy very light yellow color- pretty unique looking for a IIPA, normally much darker of a color. nice head and decent retention, after a few minutes it recedes and leaves a sticky looking lacing around the glass. Smell- wow. a blast of citrus to the nostrils. Lemon zest, tropical flavors (mango, pineapple, papaya). Very herbal and clean smelling. This smells amazing. Taste- WOW. I am blown away. Just a blast of citrus on the front of the palate. Almost puckeringly citrus sourness, like biting into a lemon. It rounds out with some sweetness on the backbone that balances out the tropical fruit and citrus, leaving just a perfect mix of citrus sweetness on the end. No real bitterness here, the hops manifest themselves almost 100% in the form of fruit/citrus/tropical flavors and the sweetness that the malt delivers is just amazing. I just burped and up came some piney flavors. This is a perfect beer. Just absolutely amazing. Getting a 5 on all fronts from me, officially better than Pliney, and all the other elite IPA's I have ever had. I'm blown away by this beer. 1,281 characterslnashsig, Dec 01, 2011

Overall, a top tier IPA from almost every angle. This is definitely impressive, but I think I prefer some of the other VT IPAs just a bit more. This is close to flawless though. Recommended. 917 charactersGosox8787, Dec 01, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to koopa for sharing this one. 
Pours a cloudy, golden sunshine color with orange and lemon yellow hues and a one finger white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind.
Sweet citrus hop aroma with dank, resinous hop oils and tons of citrus and tropical. fruit. Slightly piny with lots of pineapple, grapefruit and lemon peel.
Medium bodied with a blast a dry, earhy hops which provide a perfect dry bitterness that lingers over the sweet fruit notes into a bone dry finish.  Lots of grapefruit and sweet pineapple along with zesty lemon peel.  Pale malt backbone with biscuit and cracker providing a nice counter without taking away from the hop bitterness.  Simply put, this beer tastes amazing. 745 characterscorby112, Nov 30, 2011

The nose is tropical hops and a bit of malt. Really nice. The taste is where this beer really shines. A good, slightly tropical bitterness gives way to a piney hop finish. Just fantastic. The body is really solid with good carbonation. This just drinks like a dream. I have had a lot of IIPAs and this is one of the best. 412 charactersseeswo, Nov 29, 2011

The smell is citrus and pine hops all rolled into one. The flavor is hugely hoppy with a real hop bite the citrus comes through first then the piney hops forward the middle followed by a bitter dry hop bite. This is the reason lawsons won the ipa crown. This beer has a nice light to medium body with good carbonations and a crisp bitter bite. Overall tied for my top two favorite ipas the other being Abner from hill farmstead. 516 charactersrowingbrewer, Nov 28, 2011

A- Comes out of the bottle looking like lemonade. 1 finger head forms above a cloudy, hazy orange yellow body. Some lacing left around the sides.
S- Big tropical fruits take over along with some bitter hops and slight sweet malt. The fruits smell so good. 
T- Nicely balanced sweetness and bitterness but bold up front. Bitterness comes through toward the middle and turns piney at the finish that lingers. Really nice stuff going on inside this bottle. 
M- slightly thicker than I usualy like for an IPA but not the end of the world. Medium amount of carbonation on the tongue and my mouth is left feeling syrupy after sips. 
O- Really nice IPA thats got a great flavor. I wish I could get my hands of more. 788 charactersGushue3, Nov 24, 2011

a: served in a lawson's finest liquids glass. bright yellow in color with a very thick haze. wow! this is almost as bright as sunshine! (sorry, i just had to)
s: heavy citrus and flowery hop aroma. smells like a field of wildflowers and giant sliced-open grapefruits. no joke. probably the most citrus/flower/tropical hop aroma i have ever smelled.
t: citrus hop flavor dominates with flavors of tropical fruits like passionfruit and mango. slight bitter pine character. perfectly balanced and surprisingly refreshing. want more.
i was completely blown away by this double ipa. i knew it was going to be delicious, but i didn't think it would be "highlight-of-my-trip" delicious. well done, and deserves the straight fives. 789 characterstzieser, Nov 15, 2011

nice big head, fades slowly with nice soapy lacing, hazy golden carrot orange color.

Taste is creamy malts, sweet ish, tropical fruits, nice big citrus orange rind, tangerine, peach, mango, touch pineapple, fairly bitter, nice big long bitter hoppy finish, more lingering citrus and tropical fruit, more bitterness and dry finish.
Mouth is med bodied, decent carb.

4.89/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I was very surprised and lucky that Tim (thegrogbog) pulled this out on a random weekday in northern OH (thanks so much Tim!). Bottle 137 from batch 196. This was many months old but tasted extremely fresh and hoppy, the miracle of modern refrigeration.
The beer is golden colored and just a little murky, a result of the sediment poured into our glasses as we tried to get every bit of the bottle out. What an incredible smell, this is massively hoppy, fresh and citrusy, pine needles and dank week, everything you could ask for. 
Luckily this tasted just as delicious as it smells, so resiny and hoppy, only the faintest struggle for balance given by the pale malts, excellent. Jesus but this tastes nice, and the alcohol is not discernable in any way. 
So glad to get a chance at this again, would love to try it any time in the future too. 846 charactersTurdFurgison, Aug 11, 2011

Cloudy apricot in color, with only shadows of fingers visible behind. The frothy off-white head fizzles away quickly, leaving a thin top layer, a big sticky ring and large gobs of lace. 
Bright nose. Orange peel, grapefruit, juicyfruit. Some floral character also emerges with roses and lavender. Tinge of cracker malt as well. 
Tropical! Pineapple juice, mango, grass and some stickiness meld with floral potpourri and lavender. Cracker malt adds a bit of balance. Another flash of hops appears at the swallow, with moderate lingering bitterness. 
Medium-light, fizzy body with gentle massaging bubbles. I get a good amount of tongue-burning heat and fumes — more than is suitable for an 8 percent ABV beer. 
A bright, bitter tongue slap of an IPA. 812 charactersPhelps, Jul 20, 2011

Lawsons Double Sunshine – very murky yellow…nice looking. Not much head, a few glass swirls builds a little head. Good carbonation. Very murky.

Big thanks to yourefragile for sending me this bottle out of the blue. I've been wanting to try this for some time as I'd heard a lot about it. Poured into a snifter. Rare Batch #211, Bottle #4.
A: The bomber has gold foil on the top and a simple label that becomes somewhat obscured as the moisture smears the ink. I pry off the cap and am greeted with a commendable hiss. A hard pour into the snifter yields a slightly hazy dark orange body with an enormous sea foam white head that exhibits excellent retention and leaves thick sheets of lacing on the sides of the glass.
S: Honeydew melon and cantaloupe meet peach, nectarine, tangerine, orange, and mango. The hop profile is vibrant, bright, and expressive. Malt takes a back seat to the hops but lends a subtle breadiness to the background. No evident alcohol or harsh notes, just a lot of hop expression taking many forms. Mango becomes more pronounced as the beer opens up. There's a little pine and just a whisper of onion (not at all detracting).
T: Orange, mango, honeydew melon, nectarine, grapefruit, apricot, and peach. The beer exhibits an abundance of hop flavor with a lower moderate bitterness. It's smooth and gentle while delivering lots of hop characteristics. There's a dash of pine, and that subtle and ephemeral malt caramel/breadiness that's quickly forgotten. The finish is smooth and hoppy with no evident alcohol. Bitterness waxes in the drying finish.
M: Lower medium in body with upper moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth, sticky, and dry.
Overall: A fantastic Double IPA. It's mellow and restrained, but it deserves the praise it receives. 1,646 charactersHopHead84, Jun 26, 2011

Very hazy golden amber color with a creamy white head that retains very well. Smell has a lot of oranges and tropical fruit. No real malt coming through; it's hop forward and enticing. Taste has some sweet nectarine character going on along with mangos and grapefruit. Just a touch of light grain comes through in the taste, but it still is very much hop dominant. I seem to pretty much just be getting a heavy use of Citra hops in this, but I don't care if that's wrong, I'm loving the taste of this. Medium bodied and about medium carbonation. I gotta give it up, this is one very nice beer. 628 charactersbadbeer, Jun 23, 2011

Thanks to baconsausage for this bottle!
Rare Batch #208, bottle #57. I've read some interesting comparisons involving this beer and other highly-rated DIPAs, so I'm glad to have a chance to potentially debunk them. Tee-hee. It pours a clear copper topped by two fingers of white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, orange, light pine, very light leek, pineapple, light watermelon, and light caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some orange rind, grapefruit peel, and light lemon zest. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice DIPA, heavy on the fruit without somehow overdoing it. This stuff deserves a good portion of the praise it gets. 771 charactersTMoney2591, Jun 19, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Clear gold, like sunshine itself. Forms a smallish white head, but there is good retention and it leaves some clumpy lacing on the way down. 
S: The bottle describes the beer as "juicy tropical fruit" and I see no reason to disagree. Aroma is primarily of oranges intermixed with mango, papaya, and pineapple. The slight sugary floral quality adds another dimension that only seeks to reinforce the of tropical fruit aroma. 
T: The first thing I noticed was a chewy sweetness. Then comes some more tropical fruit - though not quite as intense as the aroma. Again, predominantly orange, with notes of pineapple. Mild to moderate bitterness and some orange pith on the finish. 
M: Medium in body with a sort of chewiness to it. Carbonation is appropriate. 
O: A very good beer. Chewy, juicy, and ripe with flavor, this one is very easy to drink. Maybe a little sweet for my personal preference, but the sweetness and the tropical fruits work well together. This is my first beer from Lawson's and it certainly did not disappoint. 1,034 charactersFlorida9, Jun 19, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle courtesy of gn0sis - thanks for the hookup. Batch 211, bottle 64. A gentle pour into a Fantome tulip yielded a billowing three fingers of creamy white head which desperately clung to the sides of the glass, leaving streaks of foamy lace as it gently receded. The beer was a slightly hazy golden color with a bit of an amber cast to it. The aroma emanating from the glass was incredibly enticing - deep resinous hops, tropical citrus fruits and a sweet malty grassiness.
The taste of the beer was fantastic. Strong mango/pineapple/grapefruit flavor up front, no trace of syrupy sweetness that you get in some other DIPA's, floral and resinous hop flavor with a refreshingly bitter finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth, with a medium body and a light to medium amount of carbonation. Overall this ranks right up near the top for me both style wise and general beer wise. 877 characterssurlytheduff, Jun 18, 2011
4.54/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle into Gulden Draak tulip. Batch 211, bottle 46. Huge thanks to SneezyAchew for sending this my way. This is apparently my 500th beer review. Let’s not get all mushy. 
A: Pours a light golden-amber with a billowing, fluffy, off-white head that lasted forever. Finally the greasy mass of foam receded into a thick oily film with a towering central butte in the center and left sticky rings and streaks of lace down the glass. The final pour is a bit hazy but that is to be expected.
S: Big juicy notes of tropical fruits and sweet citrus. This is one fruity smelling brew with notes of tangerine rind, grapefruit, mango, and pineapple. I get a note or two of mint, and even ganga. There is a hint of sweet sugary caramel in there as well that reminds me of syrup covered pineapple. 
T: Not as tropical as the nose but still very very citrusy. There may be some notes of pineapple in the finish, as this beer finishes rather sweet. The aftertaste is bitter but not overwhelming. Overall, very juicy tasting, and the alcohol is masked extremely well. 
M: Full bodied, heavy mouthfeel, but I wouldn’t call it thick. It’s definitely got some chewy heftiness to it though. Alcohol is completely hidden, the carbonation is smooth and easy, and the bitterness is under control. 
O: I have not had a single beer from Lawson that hasn’t completely impressed me. If you’re new to this brewery, seek out everything you can from him, even if it’s not a style you like. Thanks again Michael for being my Lawson’s hook-up. This is great beer. 1,552 charactersscottfrie, Jun 16, 2011
5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5If you're reading reviews to see how good this beer is, just stop reading and find out how to get your hands on it. They'res alot of people saying that this beer is better than Pliny (i think so) Other people are saying Double Jack is equally good as this beer (not).
I wont get into that but I had a tough time not giving this beer all 5's. If I'd tried all the big DIPAs (Abrasive, Ephraim, etc etc) to compare I could king it the best, havent gotten there yet. I dont think there exists a "perfect" beer but this one didn't give me any reason to take points away from its score.
EDIT: Tried more big name DIPAs, this is the best IMO
A - pours hazy orange with nice white head that and nice lacing, a quick swirl reconstitutes the head very nicely
S- Pine, Citrus, Grapefruit, Tropical Fruits. Picking up Pineapple, Mango, few others I cant distinquish. Awesome.
T- Fruit up front, then malt, then hops. No bitterness though. Very well balanced. Leaves you wanting more.
M- No bite, no accumulation. Super balanced. 
O- One of the best beers I've ever had. I consider myself to be a pretty staunch beer critic who typically tries to dissect each beer to give a true critque. Couldn't really find any flaws in this one, but as the reviews show, to each his own.
But, you should own this beer, its incredible. 1,317 charactersbeenitty, Jun 15, 2011

A: Deep orange, hazy look and mega lacing. A head of a pinky that dies slowly to a ring of foamy white head.
S: Nice almost pilsner like clean malt and lemon zest with some chili soaked dank hops with an interesting smell myself and others called- 'sweaty'. Sweaty in the best way possible, but still it has something funky like that in it. Some bright fruits and citrus in there as well.
T: Again this beer really reminds me of pilsner/lager malts but with big grassy dry biting hops that are very American of course. Light in ways yet still packed with flavor. Some tropical fruits open up and are very nice complimenting some herbal notes. 
M: Light and crisp, easy drinking yet bitter as heck at the same time. Very even over the palate. 
Overall certainly a very nice brew, though at this point I think it's getting a little overrated having a straight A+ rating, this is an A beer in my opinion! Hope to try this again in the future. 1,048 charactersDreadnaught33, Jun 12, 2011

nose is aromatic; just full of flavor. big hoppy bouquet of citrus and tropical fruits, with secondary notes of malt and pine. outstanding aroma.
more of the same delivered in the flavor. lot of tropical/citric goodness with just enough balancing malt. very, very nicely done. i think it compares well with FW double jack, one of my current favorite DIPAs.
medium-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation.
overall, very nicely done. lawson's has impressed the hell out of me, though doing so seems to come easily for them. if we could just ramp up the production a bit and get some ditributed to MA... 893 charactersperrymarcus, Jun 08, 2011

A: Double Sunshine was right. This beer pours a bright, sunny, orange/yellow color. 
S: Lots of wonderfully fragrant aromas here. Juicy grapefruit and oranges, with the slightest hints of grass and pine in the background. A bit of sweet malt makes its way though, letting me know this is a bigger beer than Triple Play.
T: Very fruity and sweet. Not my favorite flavors in a DIPA, but I'm on a tropical fruit binge, and this hits the spot. Not nearly as sweet and syrupy as some other big IPAs, so I'm really pleased with this one. Also, the malt is present, but only to give the beer some body and the aforementioned sweetness. None of that Caramel 60 malt stuff going on here.
F: A bit drier than other beers in the category, making it all the more drinkable. A bit fizzy on the tongue, and just thick enough for me to consider it a DIPA.
O: I was fortunate enough to try this beer twice and the bottles weren't horribly tough to track down. If it was more readily available, I'd have my fridge stocked with all of the Lawson's stuff. 1,223 charactersawalk1227, Jun 08, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've had this beer a handfull of times now, and it has grown on me throughout those tastings. I rarely get the chance to drink Lawson's, but this was from my third trip to the Warren store. Having had Chinooker'd, Hopzilla, and Triple Play at different times all before, Lawson's Finest Liquids has most probably become my favorite producer of IPA's and DIPA's.
A: Nice and hazy burnt orange, with a thin head. Just the way a double IPA should look.
S: Lots of tropical fruit. Clementines, Pineapples...
T: Admittedly, I used to find this one a bit too sweet. This is no longer so. It really is the perfect balance of sweet citrusy flavors, tropical fruit, and a heavy pungent finish. 
M: Certainly syrupy, but not overly so.
O: Too bad Lawson doesn't have a pub that does growler fills, coz I could use 64 oz of this beer. A really exceptional DIPA. Vermont is known for this (or else they should be), and in my opinion, New England is fast becoming California's biggest American IPA competitor. Either way, Sean Lawson brews tremendous beers and as soon as The Alchemist announces their release of Heady Topper in cans I'll be driving four hours and back at the Warren Store for more. 1,191 charactersSneezyAchew, Jun 06, 2011
5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This review is dedicated to my bride. She hates long drives and agreed to make the PILGRIMAGE to Warren, VT to grab this bottle (and a few others!!) Thanks for making the drive! Cheers to you Melissa!
Well, this review started Friday night at the ACBF in Boston. For some strange coincidence the best beer of the night has appeared to me in the first several samples in 3 of the last 5 years. This year was no exception and I literally fell in love. Of course, I wanted to visit Lawson’s booth as I had heard wonderful things. As my second beer of the night I tried this Double Sunshine. The heavens opened even before I tasted it. The aroma is just unreal. Let’s just say three hours later Sean and all at the Lawson’s booth knew exactly who I was as I visited again & again.
Fear NOT, this review is NOT from a sample size. I am sitting with bottle # 17 (my favorite number) of batch 212. I got up Saturday and drove 400 miles round trip to pick up a few bottles after hearing that there was some more AND that Sean mentioned he’s done brewing this “for a while” Enjoying the bottle is just the same. Insane. 
 So this is a first for me. I have decided that this is my favorite beer I’ve ever tried. For me IT IS “the perfect 5” Seriously, what could be better about this beer other than having it fresh on tap in my basement at all times?
Pours with a fluffy off white head with decent retention. Lacing clings in thick clumps everywhere. The beer has a subtle unfiltered haze to it while being a golden amber color. Gorgeous looking beer.
The aroma, frankly is to die for. So fresh and thick with floral grapefruit peel scents. It’s almost like someone curled a grapefruit peel under your nose and released all the oils in the skin. Just below this also lies some fruitiness. The best.
Where do I start? The resinous citrus/tropical flavors just burst in your mouth. Have you seen the current Starburst commercials where they claim the juice explodes in your mouth? Well this is that in a beer sense. Your mouth waters as is splashes in your mouth with a huge burst of juicy tropical goodness. The malt profile is perfect. Light cracker goodness that provides just enough backbone to let the freshness and hops shine. It’s been said before and it’s never been more true than here. The English created the IPA... Americans perfected it. Question, can there be a wonderfully bitter aftertaste that is refreshing? The answer is YES.
Body is amazingly smooth and refreshing for a DPA registering in at 8% abv. I almost can’t believe it. This beer can do some damage before you know it. Th bright fresh mouth feel is so lively and refreshing. The only thing holding you back from quaffing it is that you will only have it on a limited basis..
Truth be told, 400 miles wasn’t too bad to grab several bottles. I would have driven a lot more, but my wife would have made me make that trip solo. I’ll do it again, I can assure you. I think I am so intrigued knowing that it’s life is so short. Certainly after a month, it starts to fade into oblivion. Of course, few of Sean’s IPA’s ever make it that long on this earth. These sure as hell won’t
I’ve often talked about how the journey for the perfect beer was as much fun as the destination. I still agree with that notion. But the end of the line was PERFECT.

4.92/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes at Friday's session of 2011 ACBF. Many times through the Lawson's line for this one.
A- This DIPA pours a nice golden color with a pure white fluffy head that billows up to the top of the glass and retains for a minute or two.
S- This is without a doubt the best smelling DIPA I've ever had. A heavy dose of tropical fruit slap you in the face. Pineapple mango at the forefront. The is also a bit of pine in there. This smells so fresh it is unreal.
T- The taste is just fantastic. It starts with all tropical fuit and has a bit of a pine bite at the end. There is no syrupiness that you get in a lot of DIPA's. The malt is there but in the background. Cannot detect the alcohol in this 8% DIPA. I would go as far as to say very refreshing. Again, cannot stress enough how fresh this tastes.
M- Mouthfeel is medium as there is no syrupy maltiness. 
O- Overall this is a true A+ beer. This is the best DIPA I've had yet. The aroma is just about the best thing I have smelled. Thanks Lawson's for bringing this to the ACBF as sadly I won't be tasting it again for some time. Cheers Sean! 1,109 charactersRobtobfest, Jun 05, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got this one in my poker winnings from baconsausage. Thanks a lot!
Poured a hazy golden orange color with quite a bit of slightly off-white head on it.
Smell was very citrusy with some floral notes coming through. Very nice aroma.
Taste was pretty incredible. Great citrus flavor up front with the hops coming through in the finish. Really a well balanced beer.
Mouthfeel was fairly light. Smooth drinking beer.
Overall a great beer that I would love to have again. I could drink this beer all night. 505 charactersrichkrull, Jun 02, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Shared at Hill Farmstead gathering. Nice fruity aroma, so much tropical fruits (pinneaple, tangerine, mango) but also quite grassy and a nice cracker like malt balanced this one nicely. Superb aroma. This one is so drinkable and is very refreshing with all the fruits and grassiness. 283 charactersLuk13, Jun 02, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Rare Batch #211, Bottle #3.
Picked up during a fantastic beer adventure with BA mduncan last week at the Warren store. The storekeep was surly (at best), no doubt protective of us out-of-staters from loading up on this glorious brew. 
The beer poured a cloudy tangerine color into a Sam Adam's glass - beautiful orange sunset hue when put directly under light. The moderate-sized head, significant for an IPA, deteriorated only slowly into lacing on my glass. 
The aroma is absolutely unlike any other beer I have ever had - I get a lot of grapefruit, mango, guava, and citrus up front, with a piney and woodsy aroma the filters in the back. As unlikely as it sounds, it's a citrus grove in a pine forest. 
As complex and unique as the aroma is, the taste follows up beautifully. A lot of the citrus and tangerine character is preserved with sweet, sappy pine. Hops are robust, but not overly so; they linger on your tongue in luscious bitterness, neither overpowering or underwhelming you. The complexities and subtle nuances keep me thinking - what an extraordinary brew. 
This is somewhat unlike any other IPA that i have had - I frequently overlook this common brew category, but without the doubt, this brew sets the bar for me. 1,238 charactersrsgcwhite, May 31, 2011

MY.
GOD.
Can... not... type...
Thank you Dean for this wonderful treat! Pours a light, cloudy orange with a very small head and some lacing. This is the only score under a 5.0 for me. THE NOSE IS OUTRAGEOUS. Pine, cannabis, vines, sap. Taste is virtually indescribable. Front end is all pine, leaves, and sap. Massive bitterness. It moves into a brief sugar cookie sweetness, then blasts with rich, citrus flavors. Finishes pretty dry and a touch of biscuity malt. HOLY EFF!!! No alcohol present. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side for the style, which I prefer. Overall a 5.0. This is in the elite class of IIPAs for me with Younger, Heady Topper, and Barley Brown's Tankslapper being the only other beers in this league. Find this. Drink it. Love life. 758 characterssquaremile, May 30, 2011

Pours a murky light gold, dark in the middle, a little ugly. A nice white head, great retention and lacing... The aroma is fantastic, so fresh, just plucked pine needles with pineapples and an assortment of tropical fruits... Taste is equally great, bitting pine and alcohol of a dipa, but muted and so drinkable. This is awesome, must try. 411 charactersjrallen34, May 30, 2011
4.54/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Tucker for this one! A bottle signed by the brewer received in the Too Many Rules BIF.
A - Pours a hazy, golden honey color. Nice tight creamy off white head.
S - Mmmm, Pliny like. Big resinous piney floral hop notes. Grapefruit and orange peel. This smells amazing. I could probably just sniff this all night.
T - Big juicy hops. Lemongrass and pine flavors at first. Quickly followed by clementine and other sweet citrus. The hops are present, but not bitter. The tongue dries out and slowly the bitterness creeps in. Not exactly "west coast" style, but not totally "east coast" style either. The aftertaste is subtle. Sweet citrus remains, but the faint touch of bitterness still lingers.
M - Oily, syrupy, chewy. Very nice. The carbonation is a touch low for my liking. The carbonation is acceptable, but I would like just a touch more, personally.
O - Best East Coast DIPA? I'd have to it's absolutely in the top 5. Wow, just a delicious treat. I love my WC style hop bombs, but this was a welcome change of pace. Now I just need to figure out how to get some more of this stuff. 1,103 charactersGenghis22, May 27, 2011

Review from written notes.
Into a small tulip glass it pours a saturated orange tone, with a slight haze to it. Lasting cap of white foam, with a ring of lace crowning the rim of the glass. 
Dank... and I mean Dank aroma, lush and resiny, super pungent fresh hops taking on an almost cheesy quality. Phew!
Big citrus notes lead off initially, lush with bitter orange peel and leafy greenery. Again an almost cheesy quality about the hop varietals used. Lasting aftertaste, dry and bitter, resiny and clinging to the teeth and gums. Super fresh impression, very resiny with lush citrus. This is great stuff, thanks again for sharing Brian! 695 charactersemerge077, May 24, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Hazy orange juice colored with a thick, pillowy head just off white. No lace.
What a nose, tropical and citrus flavors burst from the glass. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, starfruit, orange, lemon zest and more. Nice underlying Bready maltiness helps round things out.
Nicely balanced and wonderful hop compexity. Oily and full of resinous tropical flavors. Grapefruit and mango devour the mid palate with help of Bready, grainy malts to round things out. Pineapple, lemon, orange zest, and more. Nice snappy carbonation with some acidity at the finish. Except for a light astringent finish this is a fantastic beer. 617 charactersmcallister, May 22, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz botle, 8% abv. Bottle #94. Hazy gold, with a slight orange hue. Great fluffy white head. Great retention and lace. 
Bursting with juicy hop aroma. Lots of tropical fruit, pineapple, mango, with a slight pine edge. Caramel malt in the background, but the hops are the showcase. 
Lighter malt character. Sharp bitterness, but not overwhelming. Bitterness has the tropical fruit characters, but also some earthy notes. 
Medium body, good carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. Very well made. 496 charactersBierguy5, May 22, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to yourefragile for bringing this over to the end-of-law school tasting. This beer is incredible!
A: Pours a bright, slightly hazy golden-yellow with a nice white head.
S: This beer smells absolutely amazing. Perhaps the best aroma in any DIPA I've ever had, and that's saying something. It's just a blast of tropical fruit and hops and made my mouth water. I couldn't wait to take a sip.
T: The taste followed the aroma and did not disappoint - very juicy fruit flavors up front, but has a very hoppy, slightly more bitter finish than I would've expected given the other characteristics; it's very easy to drink and so nice and light.
M: Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation. Just fine for the beer.
O: Hands down this is one of the best DIPAs out there right now, especially if you love the west coast style. I want to move to Vermont so that I can drink this every day. 900 charactersstarrdogg, May 15, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance is a bright yet slightly hazy yellow brew. moderate head forms and falls back quickly.
Smell is just exceptional. A sweet juicy hop aroma fills the air above the glass. I mean the smell is almost worth price of the bottle!
Taste is a good hoppy DIPA. Hoppy bitterness throughout but no too biting.
Mouthfeel is a carbonated hoppy feel.
Overall a good double IPA. The aroma of this beer is amazing! 412 charactersvtblackdog, May 14, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5seriously one of the best beers i have had in the style, not even a question and by far the highlight of the bbq on thursday night. poured into a nonic and split with calton, this was a rare treat indeed.
the pour was a wonderfully decadent hazy golden amber color with a smooth head of three inches in height and lacing that dripped down the side of the glass. crazy good look to it.
the aroma will simply knock you over, so fresh, so clean and simply stunning, fresh citrus abounds with a juiciness and ripeness that is unparelled. amazing pineapple, orange, tangerine, mango, i mean it was like straight juice pouring out of the bottle. so smooth and so fresh the hops just roll across the palate and settled on the tongue with the most mellow feel i could imagine. light grains are in the mid palate as it warms but it is the deep fruit freshness that is simply amazing here.
overall this has to be one of the best beers i have ever had. simply stunning and soo happy i got to try it. 991 charactersmikesgroove, May 08, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to mikesgroove for dropping bombs on my palate during Hobo Cookout #1 and sharing this with me! Bottle #53 from Batch #174! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a two finger slightly off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of swee malt, mango, grapefruit, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, mango, citrus, grapefruit, citrus hop, grapefruit hop, and subtle marijuana. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. Really great in all aspects on this one. The flavor completely floored me on how fresh and potent it was... Really glad I got the chance to try this one and if you have not, you should as well as it is definitely worth it! 834 charactersthagr81us, May 06, 2011

A: Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with off-white head. Lots of bubbles racing to get to the surface.
S: Big bright floral citrus and herbal hop aroma. Super clean hop presence with very little alcohol detectable and faint pale malts. The hop bitterness and more alcohol come out as it warms up.
T: Plenty of hop bitterness and citrus hop flavors with some pine notes. Some pale malts and alcohol come through significantly more in the taste than in the smell. Really well balanced, definitely enough hop flavor and bitterness to be an IIPA with enough malty sweetness to handle all the hops. Sweet hop flavors linger for a while after each sip. This is pretty good at refrigerator temp but as it warms up it gets much better. As it warms up the bitterness mellows out but the hop flavors increase and it gets a whole lot smoother and more drinkable. Yum!
M: Moderate carbonation and hop bitterness, slightly sticky medium body.
O: Solid all around IIPA, my first offering from Lawson's and I am not dissapointed one bit. Seems like Vermont is producing some world class beers lately. Changes quite a bit as it warms up, it seems that the aroma goes from sweet to bitter as the taste goes from bitter to sweet. 1,307 charactersAzurescens, May 05, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a medium gold color, slightly hazy, good frothy carbonation that leaves a nice cap and some spotty lacing.
S - A nice amount of tropical fruits with some slight floral notes. Nice and dank, yet, still has a nice clean hop character. Lots of pineapple, mango, and orange peel.
T - Slight less tropical then the nose. Orange peel, pine, grassy hops. Little to no malt detected at all, very light yet the tropical notes help with the sweetness. Solid bitterness, not overly done, which I prefer. A nice "medium".
M: Light, crisp, smooth, refreshing, oily dank finish.
D: A very nice DIPA that I really enjoyed. Not overly hoppy or big on sweetness, which I prefer. Right "down the middle", if you will. I love any/all tropical fruit notes, so that seals the deal right there. Recommend. 797 charactersSean9689, May 04, 2011
4.55/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle shared by Chris, and again by Ethan - thanks! Poured into Lost Abbey Tumbler both times. Golden color with a slightly hazy yellow and a foamy white cap settles to collar. Smell is very tropical and sweet, really nice hop balance, very green and fresh, grassy slightly sweet malt in the back. Taste is very grassy followed by tons of tropical bitter hops, some sweet tropical fruit, pineapple, grapefruit citrus incredibly complex hop flavor. Medium body and medium carbonation with a somewhat dry flavor. Very solid ipa with a unique hop profile. I thoroughly enjoyed this, one of the most drinkable beers at 8% abv. Lawsons should cease production of about half their beers (I am looking at you, maple nipple) and produce this one year round. One of the best beers in the style. 786 charactersnkersten, Apr 16, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Chris (spycow) for sharing this one. Served in a Stone IRS tulip. Most recent batch (#192?) - two weeks old in any case.
A - Pours with a finger of white foam that eventually settles to a thin cap and collar, leaving spotty lace behind. Hazed golden sunshine color - surprise!
S - Very dank, with some citrus, tropical fruits, and a slight chive aromas as well. A light burnt sugary malt character reveals that it's a DIPA, but I initially would have pegged it as a regular IPA, as there's no alcohol and it's very hop-forward.
T - Taste is laden with grapefruit, pine, and a minimal malt backbone. Alcohol is again non-existent. Initially restrained in bitterness, although it mounts over the course of a glass.
M - Medium bodied, medium carbonation, smooth texture, dry finish, and light residual resins. No alcohol warmth.
D - Just an all-around great beer. Best beer I've had from Lawson's for sure and competitive with upper tier offerings from San Diego. Highly recommended. 995 charactersMasterSki, Mar 30, 2011

Pours a slightly hazy golden color. Thin white head and a bit of lacing. For an IPA it could use more head and lacing.
Aroma is amazing. Every fruit and citrus hop aroma you can think of. Mango, peach, apricot, grapefruit, orange. Amazing. Maybe the best smelling IPA I have had.
Taste is great. Citrucy hops. Little bit of malt. I think I taste some Nelson hops. Great.
Mouthfeel is nice and dry how I like my IPA's. Great carb.
Overall an awesome IPA that I hope I can get again. So glad I got to try one. 581 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Mar 28, 2011

A - Yellow colored beer that was a touch hazy, white head bubbled up. Little bit of stick left on the sides for a nice looking beer.
S - Awesome good. Citrus, pineapple, tropical fruit, subtle touch of pine, and a hint of resin. Pretty much as good as it gets on the nose.
T - Taste is right up there with the best DIPAs I've had. Tropical fruit is great and not too sweet. There is enough malt precense to give it body, but you really don't notice it. Good bitterness to it.
M - Medium bodied, refreshing carbonation.
O - Awesome beer, I want more. One of the better crafted DIPAs I've had in some time. 709 charactersAgentZero, Mar 28, 2011

Poured into a Great Lakes snifter and believe it or not, this beer looks exactly like a DIPA. Nice lighter golden color with a bright white head that leaves some lace behind.
Very citrus-y and slightly floral in both smell and taste. Not really malt to speak of which is great. Some decent bitterness and a medium body with vibrant carbonation. Would have no problem drinking the whole goddamn bottle. 460 charactersLunch, Mar 26, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!
The beer is a clear, golden hue with a thick finger of white head that leaves a generous amount of lacing on the glass. 
The aroma is awesome, and I know right away that I'm in for a treat. Pine, grapefruit, melon, citrus.
The taste does not disappoint, bringing a healthy dose of fresh hops and citrus fruits. Alcohol content is masked extremely well in both the aroma and flavor. At 8% abv, this beer is dangerously easy to quaff. Hoppy grapefruit juice. Mmm.
The feel is light to medium bodied with a very nice feel on the palate. The finish brings a healthy dose of dryness and bitter hops. 
Overall, a terrific beer and well worth trying. I've been pretty impressed with everything I have had from Lawson's Finest Liquids so far. 780 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 21, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared by Thorpe recently, thanks. The few beers I've had from this brewery I've been impressed with. I'd like to get more of their IPAs to try. They seem to have that figured out well.
Beer is really light in color, shockingly light yellow and mostly clear with a decent head of small white bubbles that leaves a little lacing on the glass. The carbonation is moderate to low.
Since this is an IPA this is where I'm suppose to say that it smells hoppy. In my experience there are four distinct hop aroma families, fruits (this can be divided further into tropical and citrus), pine, earth, and noble. This one is definitely of the fruit (citrus) variety with the pine playing catchup. Smells like simcoe, I should have read the label. Smells really nice, it's aggressive without being distracting. 
Beer is medium in body, on the lighter side of medium, with a nice level of carbonation on the palate. Not as bitter as I expected but it is bitter to an extent. The hop flavors in the midpalate mirror what you would smell in the aroma, nice citrus presence with a pine backing that carries the hops to the bittering end, this makes me think that a piny hop was used as the bittering hop and the fruit / citrus hops were late additions. Overall a great DIPA. I'd have it again for sure. 1,296 charactersdrabmuh, Mar 21, 2011

a - Pours a murky golden color with less than one inch of white head and light carbonation evident.
s - Smells of citrus hops, grapefruit, honey, pine hops, fruity malts, tropical fruits, and melon. Wow, this has to be one of the best IPA's I've ever smelled. We had Ephraim from Hill Farmstead earlier in the night which was amazing, but I liked the nose on this one even better.
t - Tastes of citrus hops, fruity malts, grapefruit, light pine hops, and tropical fruits. Some moderate bitterness up front. I think I enjoyed Ephraim's taste better but this was still a very nice DIPA.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation, Some bitterness up front, crisp finish.
d - Overall this was an awesome DIPA and another great beer from Lawson's; it made me really want to try more of their stuff. I've had two of their IPA's now and they've both been very good. The nose was so hoppy and fruity it was perfect to me. Would love to have it again. 1,093 charactersmdfb79, Mar 21, 2011

Pours a bright, clear golden yellow color with a good white head and plenty of lacing as it goes down. The nose immediately lets me know that this is going to be delicious. It has loads of citrus character along with a bit of pine; slightly dank. Great hoppiness. The flavor carries the same notes, and the citrus hop character pairs really well with a great amount of bitterness. Very good. Light to medium body with a great dry finish.

A-Pours a very hazy golden apricot with a nice cap of frothy off white head. A nice off white sheet of lacing.
S-Juicy citrus, sweet pineapple and mango with a nice malt undertone.
T-More grapefruit than pineapple but still quite delicious. Pleasantly bitter from start to finish with a grapefruit start and a lemon finish. A nice malt backbone as well.
M-Medium bodied, nicely oily, moderate carbonation.
O-Terrific example of the style. The hops are prominently displayed but the bitterness is understated and vibrant.

Pours hazy gold with an orangy hue and a two inch head of rocky, beige foam. Loads of thick, sheeted lacing with a solid foam cap for the duration of the glass.
Pungent hops leap from the glass as soon as the pour begins. Cracked garlic, onions, pine, grapefruit, mango, and pear. Very dank and reaking of kind-bud. 
Medium bodied with a gummy, tacky, resinous mouthfeel. Lush and creamy.
Pine-rubbed grapefruit with shades of melon and tangerine start the palate. Undertones of honey and hop sap follow through.
Finishes with a firm but very smooth bitterness, dank, earthy citrus, and some faint malt. Very dry, smooth, and loaded with finishing hops.
Wowza. Sean nailed this one. A world-class IIPA and uber-fresh. 772 charactersbrewandbbq, Mar 05, 2011

Batch 189, Bottle #9. Yellowish head... with great retention and lacing... hazed hellow orange brew...
Nose is fantastic mix of tropical fruits.. melon and apricot.. dried pineapple and lime tree blossoms.
Bracing bitterness out of the gate and it lingers through the finish.. hop flavor is still tropical with a bit of citrus... pretty dry with only enough pale malts to play well.. 
I would swear this is a PNW DIPA... but the bottle says otherwise.. I like it.
Body is a solid medium with a nice carbonation.. Awesome and very fresh.. The "lack" of maltiness may be a minor detriment, but I am not gonna complain. This is a damn good brew.

Very cool Jason.. I'm humbled. 867 charactersJohnGalt1, Mar 01, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 192, as fresh as can be, delivered to the Warren Store today.
Pours a nice hazy golden orange color, and the smell is outstanding pineapple, citrus, and piney hops, theres a hint of something floral. Tastes absolutely wonderful, follows the nose and the grapefruit really comes out. The bitterness only comes through on the finish, but it does linger. The abv is not noticeable, along with with the deliciousness of this brew and that bitter aftertaste that can only be quenched by another sip make this one of the most drinkable double ipas I've come across. 
This batch is great, although I really enjoyed the first run, the most recent one is just wonderful too. Sean's really getting this recipe dialed in just right. 727 charactersiwantmorehops, Feb 26, 2011

Grassy hops with a touch of citrus as well. Perhaps a hint of mint as well.
The taste is full of a citrus blast that overrides the grassiness. Its just where it should be.
Mouthfeel is full of lingering citrus and perhaps a smidgen of malt.
Deceptively drinkable with more of a balance than I expected. I would certainly buy it if it were more readily available. 415 charactersBrad007, Feb 13, 2011

I've been digging these tiny breweries lately & more excited to try their stuff than most saltwater amphibians. Shared with my wife as the last beer on a quiet Friday night after an afternoon of ice fishing. 
Bottle #17. Pour is quite the ray of sunshine in a glass; I also like Lawson's simple, cool label. Smell is juicy hops. 
Juicy is the word on the bottle, & the word to describe Double Sunshine. This is the JuicyFruit of IPAs, I kind of expect pulp to be dripping down my chin. Huge floral, piney hops. There's earthiness in there too. Tongue-numbing bitterness lays about my tongue & mouth-skin. The only drawback is that dusty, dirty taste that sticks around in the aftertaste. 
I don't know what hops were used to make this, & I suspect the freshness is showing, but this is pure hop-head territory. Not much in the way of depth, no subtlety, negative amounts of malts were clearly used in the recipe. That's the way an IPA should be made. Hop-forward. I like it. Excellent beer. 1,048 charactersmaximum12, Feb 05, 2011
4.57/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This was my second sample of this delicious brew....first was due to a very generous BA who shared at Capone's Hill Farmstead Event. Big thanks to another great BA who traded me this bomber.
Appearance: Pours the color of pumpkin paint with a smidge of rust mixed into it. Crown is 1 finger, slightly off white (a bit hop stained yet dull) shows moderate retention and good lace.
Smell: Wow nice tropical hop presentation. Lots of pineapple, candied orange peel, hint of sweet red fruit, a bit of pine resin and strong grapefruit notes (including pith). Amazing when fresh!!! Not so much 2 weeks later so keep that in mind when reviewing your bottle!
Taste: Same as nose. Delicious.
Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied with good carbonation. I'd like a bit more heft personally.
Drinkability: I'd give it a 5.0 if the mouthfeel was better. 847 characterskoopa, Feb 05, 2011
5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522 oz bottle, batch 183, bottle 99. Thanks Conor and TCassel! Shared with Jeff and Ben.
Pours a bright, slightly cloudy golden color with a massive, fluffy white head. Head never fades and leaves streaks of thin lacing. Aroma is pure hops, fresh and dank. Dominated by pine and floral notes, slightly sweaty, with a background of sweet tropical hops and malt. Flavor is strong fresh pine and citrus rind. Very clean and dry with a pleasant mild bitter finish. Mouthfeel is soft and medium thick, exceedingly drinkable. A little lighter than your typical DIPA, but extremely enjoyable and smooth.
Update. Just drank a few bottles of batch 211 within a few days of picking them up from the Warren Store. After being lucky enough to have this on 4 or 5 occasions, this has become my favorite IIPA. Tons of fresh tropical and citrus fruit with balancing, not abrasive bitterness, this is incredible.
Update 2/16/12. Eff it. One year later, still has never disappointed me and drinking a fresh sample now complements of Josh. If I don't give this a 5, I will never give anything a 5. 1,081 charactersyourefragile, Feb 03, 2011
4.52/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Provided by Michael and also split with Ben, thanks for providing this rarity!
Pours a hazy gold with about a finger of short-lived head that fades to a thin layer with some nice lacing left on the glass.
Aroma is tons of fresh piney hops with some hints of lemon in the background. Not much malt is evident, but it's hiding in there somewhere.
Taste is a little sweet up front then the loads of piney hops hit and steal the show. Finish is some bitter resins.
The mouthfeel is fairly thick but exceedingly smooth with a pretty good bit of carbonation. The smoothness and well balanced flavors make this one easily drinkable. Very nice beer, making me want to try Lawson's other offerings. 693 characters321jeff, Feb 03, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to kingcrowing for hooking me up with this brew. Cheers Nick!
Appearance: Poured into my DFH glass, this brew is a cloudy, honey color with about a half inch worth of off-white, foamy head. The retention is pretty good, and as I swirl the brew around in the glass I see soapy rings of schtick clinging to the sides of the glass.
Smell: Fresh, glorious hops! Lots of resiny pine going on here with some nice citrusy grapefruit notes. Really robust.
Taste: Most impressive! The hop profile doesn't really hit at first, it builds slowly and peaks to a clean, bitter finish. Lots of pine and some overripe grapefruit. I do love me a fresh IPA!
Mouthfeel: A crisp medium body, good texture and carbonation, and ample carbonation.
Drinkability: This is a great tasting beer. Loads of fresh hops, lots of great flavor. I'm wishing I had more than one bottle of this. Absolutely recommend!
Thanks again Nick! 917 characterskrisandajt, Jan 28, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422oz brown glass pry-top bottle with gold foil. Rare Batch #183, Bottle #62.
Pours a nice pale hazy orange with some thin white head. Rim looks a little watery.
Nose is great, lots of bitter grapefruit, herbs and cat pee kinda thing. Thought it was Amarillo, but I was wrong according to the brewer. Guessed Simcoe next, still wrong.
Palate is bright and aggressive on the hops! A true VT-style DIPA, with a juicy, chewy texture despite the light malt character/body. Palate is dominated by a hop that I'm not personally that fond of. Lots of sticky bitter orange, bitter yellow grapefruit and some leafy "herb" notes. Lots of gripping bitterness and some residual sweetness in the center (in true VT fashion).
Notes: A damn fine IPA, well brewed, but not really to my personal flavor profile. 797 charactersSFLpunk, Jan 26, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The color of this beer is of a nice golden sunshine hue. The head is a nice finger. finger and a half. White that dissipates slowly and leaves it self on the side of the glass as you drink. 
The smell is of fruits grapefruit, pineapple, and a hint of orange. There is a finish of pine. Everything is there for a great DIPA and each smell is distinct as you breath it in.
I tend to start all my beers extremely cold so that I can get the whole taste gamut of a beer. This was a bad idea on this one. It started off as an "eh" DIPA because it was so cold all I got was pine and grapefruit. I let it warm and the beer completely blew me away. All the smells come through in the flavor. It starts with a grapefruit up front quickly followed by the pineapple/orange flavor. Quite a nice fruit flavor throughout. The end is of the pine I mentioned in the taste, with an oily finish across the tongue that dissipates quickly.
This just rolls across the tongue nice and smooth. the finish is like a nice pine oil across the tongue that disappears as fast as it came.
Man I wish I had picked up that second bottle now. I tend to avoid most IPA's of any type, but I had heard that this was an amazing brew that had to be tried and it definitely lived up to it's hype. 1,261 charactersKelp, Jan 25, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: golden yellow with good clarity and a good amount of rising carbonation. Good level of head that holds well. lacing is good but not great.
S: A burst of orange, pineapple and mango followed by a nice piney and grapfruit note. some herbal and floral notes qualities are present as well. the hops are very well rounded with no sign of astringency 
T: Again very citrusy hop profile with some bitter pine and grapefruit. very juicy and fresh tasting. Some grassy notes provide an earthy quality. The maltiness is subtle and light while still providing a bit of sweetness
M: Very smooth with no heat and a perfect level of dryness
D: A great DIPA overall that is extremely easy to drink with no offensive qualities at all 724 charactersmikey711, Jan 23, 2011
5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I think this is one of only 3 reviews that I gave a full 5 stars on.
This beer is ABOVE par with any of the top Double IPAs around, be it West or East or 3rd Coast. This stuff is the bomb...I dont know why everyone is so up in arms about Heady Topper when this beer here is a clear winner and trump HT in overall drinkability and quality. Its a hop heads dream. I had this beer along side some HT and Pliny, and I preferred this beer easily over the others. From first pour, the bouquet was awesome, the appearance was just beautiful with its amber color and off white head. The taste, where do I begin? Its just awesome, hops hops and more hops with good balance and not overly bitter but just enough grapefruit bite and left an oily but no overpowering lingering taste, mouthfeel was good. Overall, this is one awesome DIPA and I hope to God that I can score more of it. 
Well done Sean Lawson, and thanks for getting me a bottle of this! 941 charactersSolomon420, Jan 14, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I understand most west coast beer geeks believe they have a lock on the best IIPA's and they are mostly right. Lawson's is so small, lack of distribution will never impact enough left coast taste buds to alter that wide held notion. BUT, if you get a hold of this one, expect the best!
A: Pale straw and minor haze, medium white head
S: Bold and fruity hops abound! Intense citrus and clean, with a a hint of buscuit.
Taste: Simular to nose, with strong "C" hops first with pleasing but intense bitter and just a sense of malt backing. Finishes with a bite of bitter and pepper.
M: Smooth and well carbonated - 
D: Get 2 or 3 of these if you can because it's a delight in evey way from the moment you pop the top and get a face-full of hops, to light lacing and a pucker-up finish. Drinks considerably lighter than the 8% would imply, with slight boozyness as it warms. 869 charactersspider05660, Jan 03, 2011
4.07/5  rDev -10.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Bottle #3! Thanks ATLBeerdog. A quickie, 'cause we have lots to drink.
A gold hazed DIPA with a short head, lace and reeking of delicious hops. Seriously one of the better noses on a DIPA I've smelt lately, reminds me of Pliny the Younger (yes, really) all tropical and mango / pineapple and dank, green and sweet and fun. Alas, the flavor is a bit pedestrian after all that, the malt not really standing up to the hop rush. A bit thin and the finish is short and doesn't stand out. Still... worthy, and should be better fresh. 
Double Sunshine isn't outstanding, but it is a very good smelling DIPA with a lot to like about it. 630 characterskkipple, Jan 02, 2011
4.1/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This will be my first Lawson's beer. Heard great things about this brewery. Glad to finally have some of their beers to try. 22oz bottle, bottle 86 of 174...
A: A beautiful clear golden honey color with a 1 inch off white head that fades at a decent pace to a tiny lace atop the brew. Very good.
S: I can smell this from the glass on the table. Very interesting. It's like a tropical smelling IPA. Think IPA citrus with some pineapple and banana. I get some strong earthy citrus upfront with some apple and pineapple quick to follow. Some grapefruit on the backend. Very faint booziness hidden on the back. Very good.
T: Taste is not as complex as the scent unfortunately. I get a quick bitter hop upfront quickly subdued by some watery malt. Some dry pineapple in the middle with a smooth creaminess buried on the backend. Blended well. Decent.
M: Full bodied with a good carbonation feel. A nice clean and dry finish. Very good.
D: This one goes down very easy.
All in all, this is a great beer. Everything is spot on with the exception of the taste. The taste is good, but not great. The rest of the categories are great. I definitely cannot wait to try more brews from Lawson's. For a unique twist on an IPA, give this brew a try. 1,240 characterssteve8robin, Dec 23, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Portsmouth brew pub glassful- soft pour still produced a big white lacing head. 
The color of this is an orange amber- golden brown. Completely devoid of floating particles or clouding of any kind- apart from its color its crystal clear; like a glass of consomme'. Very attractive.
Smell is a candied sweetness with orange peel and grapefruit blanketed by tangerine & pine. 
Tastes- Bitter, juicy tangerine hops. Almost a faint taste of berries that turns to citric tropical fruits then finishes with pine, grapefruit/tangerine and bitter hops. Nicely balanced, gentle malts and candied sweetness carry through from start to finish. 
My second glass is a colder pour than my first (the bottle was kept in the fridge during review) and is now very cloudy. Rings and rings of sticky lacing all over the inner glass. 
Mouthfeel- Crisp, fine, tingling bubbles dissipate into a juicy smooth, resinous easy drinking sauce with a slightly dry finish. 
This is a tasty IPA... I mean, glass of sunshine-
This is one of the first things Ive had from Lawson's and its great! I hope he keeps the good brew coming! 1,106 charactersjammalamma, Dec 22, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bomber into a DFH shaped pint glass. The beer pours a nice hazy glowing orange with a one finger foamy white head. The head quickly fades to a tight ring, leaving oily lacing on the walls of the glass.
The smell is all citrus hops. Sweet tangerines, grapefruit and sharp oranges are backed by a light candied sugar malt.
The taste follows the nose closely, lots of tangerines, oranges and loads of grapefruit that starts off sweet and builds to a more bitter grapefruit flavor. Just a hint of candied sugar sweetness in the background of this one, the finish is nice and bitter, leaving a juicy aftertaste.
The carbonation is spot on for the style, the beer has a nice medium body that carries the strong flavors and the alcohol is present while drinking the beer, but never gets in the way. The bitter finish invites further drinking, this is another solid hoppy offering from Lawsons. 903 charactersrpstevens, Dec 20, 2010
4.39/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bomber poured into a Duvel tulip.
Pours a hazy golden amber color with a nice one finger lightly yellow very sticky head that leads to lots of lacing. Nose is phenomenal, it's very fruity and floral, dank and spicy. Not sure how he does it with these IPAs, but they all smell amazing.
Wow, this is so creamy and juicy and dank. It coats your math with a smooth creamy hop coating - the bitterness is quite harsh, less so than hopzilla though, which means you get more fruity and vegetal flavors. The carbonation is nice, sharp and crisp but the body is almost like a cask IPA which is cool. The finish is really dry and leaves you wanting more but there is a bit of an earthy grass like flavor on the finish that's a bit too prominent for me.
Overall, it's a good little brother to Hopzilla. 805 characterskingcrowing, Dec 18, 2010
