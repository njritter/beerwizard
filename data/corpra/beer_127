Aroma is vinous, raisony, caramel, molasses, oak and herbal hops. Little sherry accent as it breathes.
Taste is sweet with caramel, vanilla, molasses, slight oak, vinous and herbal. Boozy as it warms but yet remains quite sweet throughout.
This is one thick bodied brew, so viscous and chewy with moderate to lower levels of carbonation. I heard nothing but amazing things about this beer and while it was good, I think a lot of the residual sugar in this covered up some otherwise enjoyable nuance. Regardless I would seek this out again because it is quite tasty. 694 charactersstakem, Feb 01, 2017

4.28/5  rDev -4.7%look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5Dark maroon with suppressed fizz trying to slowly rise from the deep, like an orc snuffed out in the dark, leaving some tan bubbles as evidence. Thick, sticky clear legs appear after a swirl.
Smell is deep charred oak, cutting and bright red grape, smoothing almond paste and smoked walnut, with leather, a dash of black pepper, a hint of raspberry, and cigar ash. So far there is a shocking lack of prune element. As it warms I get an added and welcome development of toasted biscuits and maple sugar candy.
Oh holy cow, the flavor is really rich but balanced with a wonderful body--a fizz that just barely surfaces on the palate with a nice, moderate to thick body.
I'm getting a really savory, mouth-watering sauce flavor like demi-glace with grape, red wine, or even raspberry, with some candied citrus I'm guessing might be an abundance of hops. I then taste some softly toasted...I don't know. Wtf is the element that is keeping this from being too sweet? This is a rare barleywine that completely avoids the prune territory, and is well balanced between sweet and savory. Okay, continuing, as it warms, there is that deeply charred oak again, but far in the background, accompanied by mincemeat, tangy caramel, and fruit leather.
17.3%??? I don't feel it at all! I'm not so sure about that listed ABV. I've had small Jackie O's bottles listed at 10% that knocked me on my ass. I drank this whole bomber, albeit slowly but probably at the same pace, and I really only feel a moderate buzz when all is said and done.
This was worth the effort it took to get it.

Pours a dark ember red-brown colored beer, together with a slowly uprising bubbly, beige head, which then disappears all too soon. After swirling the beer, its thickness becomes obvious at the glass, revealing slick alcohol legs, reminding me of drinking a Whiskey. 
Complex on the nose, not defined by an overly present barrel though. A vivid, multi layered fruit note mingles perfectly into caramel malts, evoking dried plums, raisins, fermenting grapes and red apples. A toasty nut quality sets itself atop of the malts, soothed by a flowery note. Way lighter on the nose than its abv indicates, due to its awesome balance.
Drinks utmost silk, with a nice creaminess to it, complex and rich, creating a long lasting, awesomly well balanced firework on my palate, with a warming ending.
Tastes of a glazed caramel maltiness, spiced up by matured, gently bitter hops, creating a dried, sugared orange flavor. Ripe figs, dipped into bakers chocolate and wild honey, enriched by sweet cold pressed coffee get completed by a warming raisin, pepper and clove spiciness. Finishes soft, slighty oaken, with a jammy raspberry and juice grape fruitiness, coated by caramel. 
A wonderfull sipper. Its not at all over the top/boozy/hot as I expected it to be - instead this showcases an incedible, well nuanced depth of flavors and aromas, which beautifully respond to each other. Another highlight is its mouthfeel. Many Barleywines tend to have a thinner, unpleasant mouthfeel, this does certainly not. It is silk and soft, almost a little creamy, reminding me of having a warming scoop of caramel ice cream. 1,631 charactersaleigator, Jan 07, 2017

I am finding I am not as big of a fan of barleywines anymore so maybe I didn't like this as much as I would have a few years ago. That said, this was a smooth, decadent treat that almost could serve as an after dinner drink. It was very sweet and balanced. Any hop presence had died out and the barrel character had combined nicely with the malt profile. Drinking a full bomber would have been too much so I was glad to share this on Thanksgiving Day. 551 charactersmjpolzin, Nov 26, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml bottle into a snifter.  2014 batch #2, had on 5/20/16.
Pours a dark garnet, almost brown, somewhat opaque.  No real head with a hard pour,  a slight amount of lacing.  The smell brings malt, dates, figs, raisins, some wine and cognac, toffee, a little bread and plums.  The taste also leads with the malt, then figs, caramel, dates, raisins, prunes, some cognac- not overbearing, but so flavorful.  Light cherries and oak round it out.  A hint of alcohol.  It's fairly sweet.  Smooth. full bodied, the taste lingers.  Hides the ABV incredibly well.
I don't know if a 10 ounce snifter of this every day would keep the doctor away, but I'd be happier than hell.  The flavor is phenomenal and the aroma and feel aren't far behind.  This is one to seek out, even at the very high price point. 797 charactersstortore, Jul 09, 2016

And I am fortunate to have this great barleywine waiting, amazingly never opened, to celebrate. Poured into a Fremont small snifter.  Pours a medium to dark reddish orange with a thin ligh tan head that dissipates to patches. Aroma is caramel malt, fresh and dried dark stone fruit, figs and cognac; the profile is close to an English barleywine. Flavor is amazing. Caramel, toffee, dark stone fruit, figs and dates; all fruit in concentrated form. Hints of molasses, cognac, vanilla. Big, nearly syrupy body with light carbonation. An extremely well integrated big barleywine, complex, but except for the caramel, nothing stands out, in harmony. The taste profile, like the aroma is in the English barleywine arena, but with a nice light hopping. Rich enough that the massive ABV is completely covered, with only a hint of booziness. Warming, but very drinkable. This is easily one of the best barleywines I've ever had. The cognac notes are mild, but add a very pleasant character to the other flavors. The flavor is rich and consistent from start to the lingering dark fruit and caramel finish. Misses perfection by being a little on the sweet side. There is a little hint of oxidation in this year old bottle. Really outstanding and a pleasure. I can't think of anything I'd rather drink for a milestone review. I doubt I'll ever see one again, but would get this again in a heartbeat. 1,439 charactersLiquidAmber, May 06, 2016

No booziness or harshness to speak of, lots of raisin sweetness, cognac is well balanced. If you're a barleywine person, it doesn't get much better than this. 271 charactersworldsworstextra, Apr 08, 2016

Impressive color in the body. Almost a ruby-red glow when held to light and deeper brown in the glass. Oatmeal-colored head. Lace and film plentiful and present. 5
Oatmeal-cookie comes to mind first. Butterscotch and caramel. Fruity liquor quality arrives about mid-palate and almost suggests wine. Not bursting with barrel quality to me, but that's okay. More vanilla works in eventually. 4.25
Pretty stunning flavor. First, it's rich as all hell. Sticky, thick and almost still in quality (though there is some carbonation). The feel on this beer factors hugely into the flavor. But the flavor shines on its own. Berry notes, oatmeal cookie, butterscotch and caramel, red wine. The finish is a lovely marriage of sweet bready flavors and fruit. There's some brown sugar flavor in this mix too. The lingering flavor does suggest a digestif and reflect the influence of the barrels. Now that I think about it, there is a similarity in this flavor to Grand Marnier. And I love it. T- 4.75 M- 4.5
This is everything awesome that beer can be. Thick, gooey, offering a swath of flavors and sensations, and still drinkable and enjoyable. Beyond enjoyable. Awesome. 1,196 charactersONovoMexicano, Mar 04, 2016

However, the taste is a whole other story. Sweet caramel, liquid vanilla cake dessert heaven is what you get. This is the most unique and full-bodied mouthfeel of a beer I've ever had...it's literally like drinking liquid silk. There is almost nothing in the way of carbonation, but it just works.

Sweet aroma.  Caramel, grapes, and fig.  Plum, citrus hops, and some molassres.  Vanilla and oak barrel notes. Cognac really comes through.
Fruity flavors first. Plum, grape, fig, and raisin.  Sweet caramel and molasses.  Citrus hops, fairly subtle.  Lemon and grapefruit.  Bug vanilla barrel notes.  Alcohol is noticeable but not distracting.
Thick, oily body. Mild carbonation.  Sweet and sticky on the tongue.  Flavors linger.  Boozy warmth.
Huge, complex beer.  Definite sipper and meant for sharing.  A whole bottle would be a struggle due to both the alcohol and the sweetness. 740 charactersleroybrown10, Jan 16, 2016

Poured a dark brown with hints of caramel color when held to the light. A slight brownish head that faded quickly but left sticky lacing. The smell had notes of raisin, sweet and some malt. Very little alcohol in the nose. Taste was deliciously complex with a sweet and prune like start, quickly giving way to a malt and raisin tang before finishing with just a slight hop bittering. Overall medium body with a sticky cling. Overall wonderful beer that hid the high abv almost too well and took to the multi year aging wonderfully. Each bottle I get of this will go to the cellar. 658 charactersBenGap, Jan 11, 2016

O: This has to be one of the best barleywines I have ever had.  Love BCBBS, but this is better (especially when compared to the 2015).  Am glad I picked up a few of these bad boys.  My only knock on this beer is it is slightly too sweet.  I'm hoping with a little age, that sweetness is tamed a little.  Otherwise, pretty much perfect! 680 characterstapperm, Dec 29, 2015

Batch #2
Dec/2014
Served in a tulip
Uber thick and viscous appearance. This poured thick like maple syrup. Hazy, ruddy crimson with orange highlights in the glass. The liquid was capped by a barely-there film of tan bubbles that quickly dissolved. The beer looked rather still and somewhat cordial-like.
The aroma was amazingly rich and robust. Super malty and sweet but not overly so. Loads of caramel and dark fruit notes. Sticky toffee pudding came to mind. Boozy. Really rummy. Very raisiny. Booze soaked raisins perhaps. Plummy. Maple notes also came through big time. There was a bit of a port/oxidized character. All in all, incredibly complex and intense. While I probably would not peg this beer for being aged in cognac barrels, it would not surprise me.
The flavor profile was outstanding and very similar to nose. Boatloads of rich, sweet caramel malts. Here too, sticky toffee pudding came to mind. Tons of maple and toffee character. Good amount of port-like complexity. There was a light aged/oxidized character. Boozy but not hot. This drank amazingly well for 17.3%. The booze came through a bit more on the finish. Light barrel notes. Perhaps a touch of bourbon. A hint of piney hop bitterness appeared as well.
The mouthfeel was spectacular. Uber thick and viscous. One of the fullest bodied beers I have ever tried. The liquid contained a fine, frothy effervescence. Pillowy soft on palate.
I sampled the same vintage of this beer fresh after its release and it definitely lacked depth and complexity. The year of age on this bottle however did wonders to it. This is unquestionably the most intense barleywine I have ever tried and one of the most impressive beers in general. Despite its steep ($42) price point, it was definitely worth the splurge. I would love to buy another bottle or two and see how they mature with even more time in the cellar. 1,965 charactersDamian, Dec 28, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance - The pour was deep amber in color with similarly colored bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.
Smell - There was a big malty nose with some lingering cognac notes.
Taste- Sweet malts comes to the front. There is a little grass, dates, raisins and a sweet, deep licorice finish. Every aspect of the cognac is present, except the heat. There is almost a syrupy quality to it.
Mouthfeel - The beer is thick and almost syrupy. The alcohol (at 17%) is well masked with little burn.
Overall - This is in the conversation of the best barleywines I have had. 572 charactersJohnnyHopps, Dec 07, 2015

M: so thick and rich.  boarder-line syrup.  i prefer it chilled rather than coming to room temp.  the warmer it got the tougher to drink.  mild alcohol presence.  
O: glad i got to land and drink this beast.  it was an absolute chore to finish by myself.  by far the most difficult beer/bomber i've done by myself.  this is good but almost too much of a good beer in a sense.

Having said that, glad I was able to score a bottle of this and realize why it gets the numbers it does.
This was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a dark red to having some light brown hues residing along the edges. A one finger white foamy head retained it's edge at the top for a good about thirty seconds and then died off at a nice pace.
The smell started off with big sweet boozy and woody notes sliding into some caramel and toffee with some dark fruits.
The taste was immensely sweet through the previously mentioned flavors and allows a fairly clingy sweet sugary aftertaste to slide into the finish.
The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a nice sipping quality to it as the booze does end up hitting a bit but doesn't come across too heavy. Carbonation really is under for this one, allowing some stickiness to cling to my tongue.
Overall, while this barleywine sits on top of the world in ratings, I will admit, it is very good personally but does lack a bit with the "hops" side of the wheelhouse to make me feel its an "American" version of one. Still, for some odd reason, its drinkability is quite enthralling and quaint enough to make me want more. 1,298 charactersBack_in_the_Saddle, Nov 20, 2015

Beer #1000 for me! Wanted to make it a special one, and I did. Thick into the glass, aroma made us all cringe in fear. Booze and more booze on the nose. Taste is of plum, raisin, sugar and booze. Very sweet, but that's how I like my BA Barleywine. Thick, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Worth the wait! 305 charactersCasey3236, Oct 24, 2015

Batch 2, bottled Dec 2014
BA review #775, on my way to 1,000!
Thanks to eb1610 for sending this one over in a trade!
A: Pours a dark mahogany, essentially opaque, less than 1 fingers width of tan head dissipates fairly quickly.  Leaves no appreciable lacing but does leave some alcohol legs.  4.25
S: Wonderful sweet boozy notes.  Cognac is very prevalent from the barrel aging.  Base beer characters of huge caramel/toffee, as well as vinous dark fruits. Some booze to round it all out.  Fantastic.  4.75
T: Hugely sweet, like the nose theirs tons of cognac.  In addition, lots of caramel/toffee and candied sugar.  Boozy notes to balance.  4.75
M/D: Full bodied, carbonation very low which is appropriate, a bit syrupy, ABV is noticeable but for 17%+ its exceptionally well masked and drinkability is dangerously good.  4.75
O: Exceptional beer.  One of the best Barleywine’s I’ve ever had.  4.75 937 characterszac16125, Oct 22, 2015
5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Shared with 3 others so we all got full pours in 5oz taster glasses and I really appreciate that. Beer of this style I feel truly need to be enjoyed in all elements. Poured a dark cloudy brown. Nice thin head that disappeared very quickly. Aromas were toffee,butterscotch,burnt brown sugar, and caramel. Slight vanilla. Your can definetly tell its not bourbon barrel aged but know it's aged in some barrel. Couldn't really pin point cognac but barrel for sure. Taste was sweet butter toffee. Brown sugar. Vanilla. Flavors were everywhere. A little fruity. Like dates or figs. As it warmed the cognac really comes through and everything mellows. The flavors almost seem to seperate. Each sip you taste a different one. First the fruits then burnt brown sugar then Carmel. Wow this one really just gets better each temp degree it raises. Must have sat on my 5 oz pour for an hour slowly sipping here and there as we cracked other bottles. By the time I got to the last sip I was truly blown away. Hands down best ba barleywine I've had!!!!! 1,038 characterscarrionricardo, Oct 21, 2015

Lot's of dark fruit, raisins, figs, some toffee, some vanilla and oak. The body is sweet but not ridiculously so. It hides the 18% ridiculously well. But the sweetness of the dark fruit comes out in the body with figs being the most prevalent to me. One of the best barleywines I've had. 379 charactersW_Des, Sep 24, 2015

A: very brown brackish in color very hazy small white little head and soapy. When you swirl it the beer has legs looks high alcohol
S: so much vanilla, toffee, caramel, figs, dates, raisins, alcohol some oak  this is like candy soaked cognac 
T: my....its so silky it has a lot of vanilla sweet candied figs and dates with this like burnt sugar but a good way almost brown sugarish such a nice toasty taste to the finish 
M: very soft hardly any carbonation but it has a silky viscous mouthfeel 
O: This beer is a must have its amazing the depth of the flavors is insane and the smell is just as good. That little bit of brandy soaked toastiness in the end is worth the price of admission. Let alone having such a beautiful vanilla toffee fig plum and raisin and brown sugar taste. I'm shocked to see this is an American Barleywine because the hops are completely absent to my taste buds. 929 charactersSomethingClever, Sep 11, 2015

Sweet, syrupy goodness which I appreciate because it's a Cognac barrel aged beer. It would've been off-putting if it were any other barrel (other than perhaps brandy or wine barrel). The heat is dangerously low. Nice barrel notes in the finish. 312 charactersRollzroyce21, Sep 08, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Serving Type: Bottle (Batch 2)
Consumed: 8.8.15
A: 4.5 Pours caramel brown with a bit of red around the edges. Small, light tan head that dissipates rather quickly.
S: 4.5 Nose is very intense with lots of oak, vanilla, toffee, sweet malt, and caramel. Not much in the way of hops on the nose. Smells like a classic, barrel aged English barleywine turned up to 11.
T: 4.5 Starts quite sweet. Not cloying, but definitely a sipper. Flavors match the nose well; there’s more toffee and caramel though, with vanilla and oak a bit more subdued. The barrel is interesting as it doesn’t taste particularly like cognac. Rather, the flavor is reminiscent of a bourbon barrel. As the beer warms to nearly room temperature, there’s a really nice orange peel flavor and some very light hop bitterness. The high abv is hidden incredibly well. 
M: 4.5 Rich body but not too thick. Carbonation is low, but it really should be for such a big beer. Drinkability is obviously hindered due to sweetness and intensity.
O: 4.5 Anchorage did an excellent job with this huge barleywine. There are a lot of great, classic flavors going on, but they also successful added a twist with good hop treatment that doesn’t take away from the base beer or barrel. 1,244 charactersTele, Aug 10, 2015

A- Pours a reddish medium brown color with a 1/4 inch light tan head that retains well before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and some wisps of sheer surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves tiny clots behind.
S- Total dark fruit in yo face.  Raisins, figs, plums, molasses, it's all there.  Big booze presence as well.  Also some burnt sugar.
T- Brings out all the excellence of fortified wine with notes of brown sugar, caramel, toffee and more molasses.  Definitely on the sweeter side with some vanilla tones.  Pecan/walnut aftertaste.   Woody flavor comes through as it warms.  All-in-all, still has that American Barleywine flavor profile as the hops are there even after the aging and the malt profile is that of such.
M- Incredibly silky smooth and luscious.  Also thick and sticky at the same time, like a fortified wine.  Medium-low carbonation and a body leaning toward the fuller side.
O- One of the most complex beers I've ever had.  Contains the flavors of both port and barleywine in the best of ways.  So dangerously drinkable, you'd better be sharing a bottle with a friend if you know what's good for you.  I'd like to see more beers like this where it shares the "wine" aspects of barleywine and fortified wine through barrel-aging. 1,347 charactersImmortale25, Jul 29, 2015

M: creamy and smooth with low carbonation.  A bit sticky.  Fairly hot down the chest. 
O: a fine barleywine with well hidden warmth except in feel. 367 charactersBugs318, Jul 27, 2015

Smell: Picked up a bit of booze on the nose as well as raisin
Taste: Consistent with the smell with regard to the booze and raisin.  Not overbearing with the booze though, the raisin dominated
Feel: Pretty thick mouthfeel, a nice trait of the beer
Overall: Very impressed, could have been a bit less sweet for my preference, but overall very good. 400 characterslinnymtu, Jul 20, 2015

S: Rich, opulent sweetness - cognac, vanilla, toffee, raisin, and oak. Decadent.
T: Opens with candied dark fruits, followed by intense, almost chewy caramel maltiness. Vanilla and brandy from the barrel join in on a warming finish that lasts for days. Substantial burn, but in a satisfying way that suits the beer's strength - never harsh. Delicious.
M: Thick, viscous, and lightly carbonated. 
O: A beast of a beer, but one that never feels out of control. Very well done indeed.

A  darker then expected, brownish amber when held to the light, a little tan foam but little retention and no lace but at this ABV that's what I expect, some legs and visible bubbles looks like a big one alright
S I get the cognac but not much wood, maple, brown sugar, some fruit I can't place, ju jubes,  its boozy but I wouldn't guess its such a monster, some caramel apple, vanilla, honey, some rum soaked raisins, plenty going on
T  still lots of cognac, slightly more wood, sugar of all sorts, candy like, there's booze but fairly well managed all things considered, some sponge toffee, fruit liqueur maybe cherry?  hard to place the fruit in this one, more toffee, more cognac, its tasty but a sipper no doubt
M  very thick and syrupy, a couple bubbles here and there, my lips are stuck together but a little oily on the palate, there's heat but its mellow, booze hits your chest and brain pretty fast though, caramel and cognac linger
O  this one will ruin you in a hurry, massive but well executed and surprisingly easy to drink.  Its one of those beers that I'd like to try again in a decade, this one could really go the distance IMO.
 Its a good thing my wife likes BW because I'm a little over my head trying to take this one on solo, would work well in a 250ml or maybe I should just make some friends. 1,433 characterswordemupg, Jun 21, 2015

4.82/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This is the most expensive bottle of beer I've gotten so far without shipping ($33) so I was really hoping I would like it and I was impressed.
A - Very dark amber color that is somewhat cloudy from the journey this beer has taken. Has a bone colored head that subsides quickly and leaves only a few spots of lacing.
S - Big sweet malt character and a huge dark fruit character accompanied by caramel and some vanilla. The booze is not bad and only adds to the evaporation of the complex aromas. It is quite an amazing smelling beer at >17%.
T - Similar to the smell but much more robust, with a sweet malt character first and then a wash of big flavors takes the tongue. Toward the middle is the rich dark fruit and deep caramel that is almost like candied raisins which I really enjoy. Approaching the back of the tongue is the oak, caramel, and vanilla from the barrel. The finish has the dark fruits and some warmth from the alcohol. 
M - High mouth-feel with low carbonation. This just feels right and how the beer should be; soft on the palate, full flavored, and not too cloying. Again it's hard to believe that this beer is so high in ABV since it doesn't really burn on the way down.
Overall, this is an amazing barleywine. I really don't like Cognac but this beer really takes the fruit flavors and ramps it up into a very delicious elixir. It is very complex, flavorful, and a good get but at this price and at this high of an ABV I definitely wouldn't get it more than once a year or even half the volume. If you want to polish your beer resume then you have to try this one if you get a chance but don't expect gold leaf, just gold quality.

Lots of dark fruit, walnuts, and sweet candy on the nose with a great presence of cognac and strong brandy.  This is a thick drink but extremely smooth.  The ABV is noticeable but not overpowering.  On the sweeter spectrum of barleywines, but the overall texture and mix of fruits, cognac, and sweetness make this a near perfect offering.  Thank you, Anchorage. 433 charactersEveningCordial, May 23, 2015

2014 Batch 2 poured into a teku glass
P- pours a dark amber with very little to no head. There is some lacing around the glass. Very thick
S- The smell is absolutely amazing, It has dark fruits, vanilla, caramel, toffee,  brown sugar. This is by far the best smelling barley my sniffer has ever encountered. It literally is making my mouth water.
T- OMG. Candied sugar, Toffee, Vanilla, Brown Sugar, Caramel all hit your palate like an explosion. This is a Sweet one thats for sure. The high abv is unnoticable. 
M- Super thick. Coats the entire mouth perfectly. Makes for a great sipper as the taste well stay in your mouth for a long period.
O- This is by far the best B Wine I have had the pleasure of having. IMO better then King Henry and MOAS. I simply cant put how good this is. It meets everything I look for in a B Wine sweet, great flavor profile, and hidden ABV. If you could try 1 B Wine before you die get this one! 949 charactersShon4star, May 05, 2015

A- Amazing label bottle drops a somewhat hazy caramel amber brew which ends up with a thick creamy head. Pillow thick ring leaves rare lace.
S- Old Ale caramel delivered by the devil himself apparently, its huge. Cognac, toast and raisins with time. Apple juice rears its head with more time.
T- Massive caramel sweetness is a vast majority of the flavor; butterscotch is mentioned. Woody oak from the barrel as well as some deep sugar tones and heavy raisins. Mostly just like Old Ales but less balanced and insanely sweet. Apple juice again.
MF- One of the most oily and viscous brews I have encountered. That being said it has a creamy and smooth texture despite low end carbonation. No heat, somehow.
Tastes like an underfermented sweet homebrew with some oak chips thrown in. Caramel sugar bomb. Apple juice flavors just don't mesh well with the rest of the brew. Maybe a different batch or something but this is not what I expected. 989 characterscbutova, May 03, 2015

This is a BIG beer, all around.  Big taste and mouthfeel.  Big Barleywine which is fairly seet up front with the apple barrel taking over 1/2 way through, well into the long finish.  It would take a while to sip on even half this bottle, so as with most beers, best shared with friends!  This one lives up to the hype. 371 charactersIowaBiertrinker, Apr 28, 2015

4.47/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big ups to Sanderson for providing this bottle; I’ve been looking forward to it like a Friday night in Venice. 750ML bomber with some awesome bottle art & a bizarre, stream-of-consciousness poem on the back that I felt compelled to read out loud. Plus points already. 
The pour is low carbonation & looks like it could be solidified slightly & worked into a clay animation video. The smell is more akin to a fine liqueur one might sip looking out over the pier in Lisbon. Cognac, caramel, love. This just smells like it’s going to kick ass. 
A Deal With the Devil makes me stop & smell the roses; I’m going to savor this like a twelve minute lap dance. The cognac here is not subtle but smoother than a Cano swing, without a hint of alcohol or harshness. The malts are secondary: toffee, caramel, roundhouse of sweetness, candied sugar, brown sugar…this should have a vial of insulin taped to the bottle. Vanilla, honey emerge as it warms. Alcohol finally emerges as a nuclear chain reaction in my gut, spreading warmth in every direction. Too many subtleties for my B- brain to comprehend. Sticky, thick, & sticky; I’d like this to be made into a syrup I could pour on my Belgian waffles. Drinkable? Shit. I could have drunk the entire bomber, gone & cracked another, & only been regretful tomorrow when I woke up & left several ounces undrunk, slipped out of my hand & spilled on the (wonderfully smelling) carpet. 
This is better than Jurassic Park. Let me clarify, this is better than East of Eden, though doesn’t reach the level of Dune (though really, what does?). Anybody who’s looking for complexity, or an expensive drunk, or a kick-ass barleywine, should really just give their bottle to me. Excellent beer that’s only a chip shot from the elite. 1,775 charactersmaximum12, Apr 26, 2015

L: Hazy caramel. Would be perfect with some head, but at nearly 18% it's understandable.
S: Cognac and caramel. It sounds simple, but it's quite heavenly.
T: That's basically as good as it gets. So incredibly rich. The cognac is so smooth, rich caramel and malt just coat your tongue. 
F: I don't know how they do it here. 17.3% and not a sign of alcohol. It's ridiculous. I think I may have gotten just an ever so slight hint as it warmed for 30 minutes, but it was still barely noticeable. 
O: My second favorite barleywine to date, right behind Aaron. For the price and availability though, I'd go with this every time. 675 characterscultclassic89, Apr 20, 2015

As this beer falls into my glass I marvel at the visually noticeable viscosity. A Deal pours a dark copper color. Body is turbid and deep. As I agitate the glass, I can only gather a thin slice of tan, creamy foam. Spots and dots of lacing with legs like wine. Poured cold and allowed to warm. At its coldest, I get a cognac richness that is new to my senses. With warmth, the flavors don't necessarily change, they just become richer. Incredibly sweet smelling. Booze infused apples and dark fruits. Caramel and brown sugar by the gallon. Dry wood. Some wet, sugar-dipped tropical hops. One of the richest, sweetest aromas. The flavor is just as sweet as the nose suggested. Cognac really expresses itself. Lots of apple flavor. Caramel-coated figs, plums and raisins. A boozy woodiness. As it warms, it reminds me more and more of port wine. The Galaxy hops even raise a tentative hand here. Finishes with a ridiculous sweetness. Like drinking maple syrup. Softer carbonation. This beer's sweetness is so aggressive that I can't even taste the huge amount of booze hidden here. The flavor coats my palate and never leaves. A Deal With The Devil is incredibly ambitious. Cognac and probably 700 grams of sugar. I'm happy I went for it...just kidding, this beer was very overpriced. 1,366 charactersVelvetExtract, Apr 18, 2015

S- Caramel and toffee bomb. As it warms up, you get a bit more of that dry cognac aroma, but make no mistake, there is a lot of molasses-like sweetness in this beer accompanied by a bit of damp oak. As it warms up, I get a bit more of a menthol-like mint aroma that is nice and dry.
F- Incredibly balanced sweet caramel with a good toffee complement and even a bit of sweet tropical fruit. Plenty of molasses. No menthol or mint, but there is a hint of that excessive syrupy brandy sweetness that makes it particularly appealing compared to other barleywines. A bit of dark fruit and raisins as well.
M- Thick bodied, lower carbonation, syrupy but without being cloying. Finish is more of a mild tropical fruit subdued by a ton of sweet molasses and sugar.
O- Phenomenal barleywine. It's much different than King Henry or The K13 which remain my favourite barleywines, but it's almost as good as these are in its own way. Highly recommend. 1,074 charactersStevedore, Mar 31, 2015

A: Pours an opaque, dark amber color tending toward brown, with a few cm of sloppy, fine sand-colored head. Pretty good retention and some dots of lacing. 
S: Red and dark dried fruits (plum, raisin, black cherry), rich oak and cognac character, mild toffee, red fruit roll-up, orange vanilla frosting.  The fruit comes through nicely and prominently with the oak lending structure. 
T: Rich fruit melds with prominent oak and malt, moderate gripping tannins impart an abrupt and almost off flavor. Moderate sweetness. 
M: Full bodied, bordering on syrupy, with very light carbonation.  Hides the massive ABV well. 
O: Very fruit forward barleywine, with the cognac treatment only increasing this rather than providing some vanilla/oak, which is notably absent, to cut the fruitiness.  This is decidedly a step down from Sucaba or Bourbon Abominable. 879 characterspmarlowe, Mar 22, 2015

Pours a hazy deep mahogany w/ a minimal beige head, as would be expected of a 17% barleywine. Leaves a gorgeous fine viscous coat of liquid on the side of the glass when swirled or tipped, and maintains a beautiful layer of carbonation throughout.
Aroma is huge sweet dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, cognac, toffee, leather, tobacco, and just about any other rich decadent superlative you can throw at it. Yet as bold as it is, the aroma is also refined and subtle. This isn't just a big ridiculous beer for the sake of extremes. This is exquisite. Can't wait to taste any longer.
First sip. Oh, so smooth and rich, velvety. The figs/dates, the toffee, the caramel, the vanilla, the cognac, the alcohol all blend and swirl together effortlessly. There's little to no boozy harshness here, this is not a big beer that I need to choke down. This beer is complex, deceptive, seductive ... in a word, devilish. About as close to a true 5 as I'm likely to get... but I want to hold out for a truly perfect beer.
Mouthfeel is thick, velvety, smooth. Coats the palate and holds on. Here's where that fine layer of carbonation sets this beer apart. I've had extra strong beers before that get syrupy and heavy on the palate, that become a chore to drink. This one might do that too, but there's no early indication of it.
Overall, hands down one of the best strong beers I've ever had, and also one of the best beers period. 750mL is obviously a sharing size for this, and unfortunately I have no one to share it with tonight. So I hope by opening it before 5 p.m. I've given myself enough time to savor this one throughout the evening. It really is that good. 1,699 charactersdraheim, Mar 22, 2015

On the sweeter side of the style, but wonderfully complex. 299 charactersdar482, Mar 16, 2015

Sure we get them in Texas but the experience is totally different. Barleywines are typically a cold weather type of thing so it's not surprising that when reading reviews from people in Austin, TX or Tampa, FL There is a lack of knowledge regarding Barleywines and the low ratings. There is a reason BA gives Deal with the Devil a 100 score and something folks in the before mentioned places do not understand. 
This is a must have for anyone that enjoys Barleywine. Sweet and strong and better as it warms. Time only makes Deal with the Devil better so if you can get a bottle hold on to it a couple of years letting it age. Also this is a sipping brew to be shared with friends. A bottle can easily be shared between four or five people. 
If you know what good Barleywine is you will appreciate Deal with the Devil. Get it if you get a chance! 915 charactersMickeyp2814, Mar 15, 2015

Shared by a friend at a bottle share. Thanks, Collins!
Reviewed live at low altitude in Austin, TX. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.
Vintage: December 2014. Batch #2.
ABV: None listed.
Style: Cognac barrel aged barleywine.
Serving temp: Chilled. Allowed to warm over the course of consumption.
Serving vessel: Goblet.
Expectations: Sky-high given its current perfect 100 rating and #82 ranking in the Top 250.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: None. No lacing.
BODY: Dark red with brown hues. No yeast particles or hop sediment is visible.
AROMA: Cognac punches through, absolutely. Caramel. Caramalts. A kiss of marshmallow. Treacle. Hints of apple. Toffee. Loads of malt sweetness. A kiss of cherry. Some vague fruit.
Aromatic intensity: average.
Suggests a boozy imbalanced beer.
TASTE: Too sweet, but its candied vibe works. Caramel, marshmallow, treacle/unrefined sugars, hints of toffee, caramalt, amber malts, brown malts, and cognac. The cognac barrel is nice and interesting, and the marshmallow works, but overall its imbalanced, with the unrefined sugars lending a rough-around-the-edges sweetness that hides the booze but betrays the lack of adequately attenuated yeast. Green apple and vague fruit round out the wanting flavour profile.
Depth of flavour: Average.
Flavour duration: Average.
Flavour intensity: Average.
Flavour amplitude: Average.
For a barrel aged brew, it's surprisingly simplistic, lacking intricacy - in terms of both the base and the barrel. This build is cohesive, but the beer as a whole is far from gestalt. No hop profile, yeast character, of off-notes come through.
TEXTURE: Not as syrupy or sticky as I anticipated. Certainly, there's some boozy warmth, but it's not off-putting. Full-bodied, smooth, and wet. Adequately carbonated.
Not oily, gushed, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.
This texture fails to elevate the beer and doesn't accentuate the taste particularly well.
OVERALL: Huge thanks to Collins for the bottle share, but I wouldn't seek this out again, and I'm a bit taken aback it's this high on the Top 250 list (and that it's present at all); this emperor has no clothes. Maybe those spending the $38.00 USD a bottle just convince themselves it's great, but as drinkable as it is for the high ABV the flavour just isn't there. Way too sweet. Needs intricacy and subtlety.
As it warms, the cognac emerges more, making it more interesting - but there's still not a harmony of barrel to base. An above average barleywine, sure. Definitely a sipper.

I was worried this one would be too sweet, but the barrels really mellow it out. The cognac addition is wonderful. With the weight, it drinks more like a stout than a barleywine. Overall, an exceptional beer. This is neck and neck with Bourbon county for the best barleywine I've ever had. 404 charactersIckyT2012, Mar 12, 2015

Oak, coconut, and a heavy dose of vanilla. Sweet, but smooth. Raisins and brown sugar. Caramel The cognac is hard to find unless you let it warm and look for it in the finish. Reminds me of Remy Martin or Hennessy,. The abv is well hidden and no where to be found.
This drinks so easy and is incredibly smooth. Such a complex beer. I wish I had lots of bottles of this one. 387 charactersmothman, Mar 07, 2015

Pours a half finger of head that settles into beautiful swirls of lacing that dont go away, leaves nice lacing on the glass as well. Also has the coolest looking label i've ever seen.
Smell- grapes, plums, cherries, toffee, vanilla, oak.
Taste-just like the smell, a wonderful,  rich blend of candy-like sweet fruitiness blended with the sweet malt characters found in the finest english barleywines. Grapes,  plums, cherries, apples, toffee, caramel, honey, vanilla. Zero hint of alcohol. 
Feel-full bodied, rich and syrupy, but not oily. Almost no carbonation. Finishes with lip smacking stickiness.
Overall-this beer is unlike I have ever had or could ever have imagines. If you get the chance get it, dont even think just get it! 781 charactersSteveB24, Mar 01, 2015

A:  Pours a syrupy murky reddish dark brown that turns up a bit of light tan head that quickly recedes.  I'm wishing I had a plate of pancakes in front of me.
S: Caramel soaked marshmallows swimming in molten toffee.  Some dark raisiny/date aromas.  I thought this was 17% abv?  No burn at all--the booze is very well hidden.  
T:  Malty caramel sticky toffee pudding.  Woody Brandy/cognac pleasantly surfaces.  
F:  Creamy, full-bodied feel that coats and lingers long after the sip.  
O:  Possibly the best Barleywine I've ever had.  Hits on all cylinders.  Sweet without being cloying and ridiculously drinkable for such a high abv.  I'm already seeking this out again and crossing my fingers that batch 2 turned out just as well. 805 charactersTampaRainman, Feb 15, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a dark brown/black and looks totally viscous and flat until a few seconds after pouring when a fleet of tiny bubbles escape towards the beer's surface and briefly hold a centimeter of tan head. I've never seen this phenomenon with a beer before. The nose is super sweet and fruity (mainly grape notes), with toffee, a hint of tobacco, and almost no alcohol. The taste is incredibly decadent with its rich malt backbone, followed by some oak and a slight bitterness in the finish. This may be the most viscous beer I've had to date, it sits like a cement truck of barrel and malt on the palate, and has minimal carbonation, bitterness, or alcohol. I'm very impressed by this beer - it very well may be my favorite BA barleywine - and is totally worth the money. 775 charactersThePorterSorter, Feb 15, 2015

Smell: strong rubbing alcohol scent. cognac, raisins, toffee, some dark fruits.
Taste: opens with a maltiness that is closest to special b. rum and cognac along with other spirits and alcohol. more maltiness comes through with raisins, caramel, toffee and dark fruits, closest to prunes. some nuttiness. 
Mouthfeel: thick and syrupy, low carbonation, some alcohol heat but nothing like what is in the taste or smell. 
Overall: a good strong and powerful beer but does nothing to keep its booziness down flavors are good but just short of cloying. maybe this one need some time to mellow but as of now, I would give it a pass at this age. 813 charactersSportsandJorts, Feb 13, 2015

Batch # 2. Bottled December 2014.
Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of caramel, toffee, fruit, cognac, wood, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, and cognac flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great aromas and super sweet but tasty flavors.

Comes out of the bottle an interesting dark copper orange, then fills with a murky sense of dark rust red and brown, with maybe a bit of mahogany and chestnut colors.  No head creation at all on this thing, barely a pencil thin collar around the edges and faint tan.  There's hardly even a top to this beer at all either.  Sort of looks a little lifeless on arrival.
Aroma really reminds me of King Henry but better.  A sense of fruit cake like action, but more citrus and zesty in character.  Hints of thick orange, nice warmth but not overly boozy or even hot, mixed in with apricot and nectarine and maybe even a touch of peach in there also.  It's big and powerful, but it's also masking much of any other character, and there's virtually no barrel like notes going on here either.  It is however, very stunning.
Palate on first sip is very sweet rush of fruit, with an unbelievably thick body.  Huge thick rushing oils that feel cold and stuck in your palate.  Mid palate fills with much fruit cherry, grape, and then citrus warmth, with huge jammy quality.  Mild sensing action of zest and concentrate cherry like brandy.  Warmth brings out more hop bitterness just barely, but the sugary aspect gets into lots of brandy sweetness that really starts to mellow out with some warmth.  Coats all over incredibly, like a marmalade sweetness on your lips, maybe even some grapefruit hiding in there.
This beer is very hard to put into words.  A pretty impressive creation.  If the sweetness was just toned down this thing would just be out of this world. 1,621 characterssmakawhat, Feb 08, 2015

Upon hearing about this beer it was hard to imagine it would be able to come together without being a boozy mess.  Somehow Anchorage has done it - it is an incredibly clean, complex and balanced barleywine.  Tons of sweet cognac, boozy brandy fruits, very sweet oak with a light dry tannic woodiness, and the fresh crisp galaxy hops round it out very well.  On the palate it is incredibly smooth, rich, full and not overly boozy by any means.  The flavors do not compete or trample one another, all come together very well.  The more it opens up the aroma smells like freshly brandy-finished wood, sweet and very inviting, accompanied by dark chewy caramel, vanilla, and chocolate.  On top of everything it is a great looking beer - no head, very very soft carbonation, but looks like a glass of dark cognac. 
It's name and wild recipe make it sound like an overly aggressive beer that would punch you in the gut,  but it is quite the opposite.  Very well crafted and full of interesting and delicious flavor nuances.
Batch 1 cork and caged enjoyed solo 01/03/2016
Very similar to fresh batch 2 with slight oxidation, but pleasant.  Tons of refined cognac varnished wood and that brown sugar that comes from a nice subtle cognac-style brandy.  Very sweet but for barleywine palates it is very balanced.  Tons of sweet dried fruits.   Incredible depth of flavor. 1,403 characterstimc100, Feb 01, 2015

A: Pours a dark mahogany color with a slowly rising head that is very tiny and eventually goes to the outer ring of the glass
S: Very malty with notes of oak, vanilla, tannins, dark fruit, cognac, and a very light vinous note, also from the cognac. The booze is absolutely buried under complexity. Extremely close to perfection
T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a huge rush of sweet maltiness and then comes the complexity of flavor. Everything found in the nose is present and then some. Oak, vanilla, toffee, light tannins and vinous quality, hints of cognac, and dark fruits like raisins and figs all shine through. Booze is again nearly completely buried under amazing complexity and sheer maltiness. Finishes with lingering maltiness and pleasant sweet booziness
M: Full bodied with low carbonation. This is thick, with very low carbonation which makes for a very smooth and decadent brew
O: Wow. This is a beast of a beer, and one that delivers in every category. The barrel really adds some nice nuances, but surprisingly isn't the star of the show. That honor goes to the maltiness and flat out high gravity/plato of the brew. Very much worth the $30+ that was begrudgingly (at the time, not so much now) spent.

An opaque, deep crimson burgandy nectar fills the glass. A finger and a half sandy butter hued froth rests on top for a couple minutes before disappearing entirely. Once the initial foam is gone there is no head and zero lacing. 
Sweet, enticing aromas of apple, raisin, cherry, oak, cognac, toffee, some vague pine and just a hint of vanilla. This smells incredible and I keep coming back to enjoy it more. 
Oh goodness! That nose wasn't lying about the majesty it foretold. Rich, bold flavors of apple, cherry, cranberry, raisin, candy sugar, oak, caramel, toffee, maple syrup, semi earthy and a floral bitterness all wrapped up in a thick, comforting blanket of booze. It gets even better as it reaches room temperature. Despite the not insignificant alcohol heft, this goes down with an ease that belies the 17% abv tag. Absolutely delicious. 
Fantastic thick, syrupy, coating body with delightfully soft carbonation. With my mouth almost completely coated those flavors of cognac, toffee, caramel and a slight herbal bitterness linger a very long time. Outstanding 
A Deal With The Devil is a truly special brew. Of the myriad barrel aged English barleywines I've tried this is certainly one of the top two or three. It's worth the money, more than worth any hype and a truly hunt-worthy brew. I really hope that I can score some more at some point but a heartfelt thanks to @itracy63 for the surprise mail bomb from Alaska to Georgia! 1,545 charactersThickNStout, Jan 28, 2015

Appearance : Pours with a syrup-like consistency and practically zero head. Has a deep/rich dark amber color.
Aroma : Despite the enormous ABV (17.3%!), there are very little boozy or fusel alcohol characteristics. Instead it has a rich maple syrup and dark caramel aroma. 
Taste : Again, maple syrup. Think incredibly sweet dark caramelized sugar coating a brick of toffee with reduced vanilla coke drizzled on top.
Mouthfeel: Thick. I can see how the incredibly viscous nature of the beer may be off-putting for some, but I really dug it.
Overall: Definitely a sipper. Quite the extreme beer experience and truly worth the high price tag. Easily busts into the upper echelon of BA Barleywines. 710 characterstommykimchi, Jan 20, 2015

Pours like a thick, syrupy pile of mud. Like seriously, this stuff just crawled out of the bottle- it looks unbelievably thick. There's a thin layer of something that looks like molasses or maple syrup on the top of the beer. There's a very small layer of foam of bubbles that could pass as a head, I suppose, with a very small amount of lacing.
Smells quite sweet, with caramelized sugar, sweet caramel, cognac, vanilla, oak, toffee, and dark fruits.
The only drawback here is the intense sweetness- it's not off-putting, but it does keep it from being the absolutely god-tier barleywine I'd thought it would be. Beyond the sweet, intense caramelized sugar factor here, there's a good amount of niceties to be found underneath- molasses, maple syrup, dark fruits, a herbal character that honestly reminds me of aquavit, caramel, toffee, raisins, plums, blackberries, port, bourbon and sweet cognac. It's got a bit of sherry character that sort of suggests oxidation, but I know it can't be at this point.
If I was given this blind, I honestly wouldn't have been able to pick out the specific barrel it was in, because I got notes of cognac, sherry, bourbon, and port at different points.
This is probably the thickest beer I've ever had, it literally drinks like syrup. The mouthfeel is so sticky, so gloopy, so thick and delicious. I feel like I took a bath in maple syrup after drinking this. There's a very low level of carbonation. Despite the hefty ABV (which isn't noticeable, at all), and the intense flavors, it's very drinkable. It was not hard to split the bottle with a friend, and finish my half.
This is a really awesome achievement in brewing. If the sweetness was toned down a bit, and some of the residual sugars fermented out, this would be basically perfect. As it is, it's near perfect, though. 1,869 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 15, 2015

Bottle to Anchorage Teku
750 Ml Capped
Batch 2 - December 2014
App- Out of the bottle this was so confusing to me. A couple bubbles and I am thinking its a flat BA Barleywine then BAM! Its a reverse Guiness. All the bubbles come flowing out like a cascading river. Comes to a head with 2 fingers of tan bubbles. Rich, creamy and smooth. Very frothy and looks amazing.
Smell- Smells like a loaf of bread to me with with lots of dark fruits baked in it. Plums, raisins and of course the smells from the barrels come next. Vanilla and Oak. The next thing is the bitter hops on the nose. Quite an interesting mix on this one. I get a bunch of citrus on this one as well.
Taste- Well its a bit more than I thought and a bit more let down as well. Its a big beer to say the least. A ton of flavor from the actual beer itself and the barrel aging process. The flavor of the beer is much like Dr. pepper. A lot of fruits and some other flavors you cant place but its tasty. A very thick drinking beer. A lot of esters from the alcohol, a little middle flavor comes in from the hops and then a bit of the oak. Just large and in charge but needed a bit of calming. Maybe after sitting the flavors will meld. I just couldnt wait.
Mouth- A very large beer. A good solid thick body with a very thick and creamy carbonation. Like drinking an espresso or a latte with the residual foam creeping up on you. The residual flavors are the dark fruits and the flavors of the cognac aging.
Drink- This was a good beer. Bordered on great with time I think. Its a bit thick and chewy with a bunch going on. I saw signs of greatness in it. I will admit. This kicked my ass. I can drink some big beers but I needed a nap. Well done Gabe. 1,738 charactersFosterJM, Jan 10, 2015

One of the most intriguing pours ever... dark brown and opaque, looked almost flat at first... a nice sticky one finger head eventually developed and only subsided a bit
The nose is huge with grape and cognac, some toffee and burnt sugar
Flavor starts with toffee and grape and runs a gamut of  vanilla, oak, fig, buttered popcorn, prune, and cherry after that
Mouthfeel is think, intimidating, almost chewy... nice!
Price point seemed a bit expensive, but I grabbed it anyway. I'm glad I did. If not the best barley wine I've ever tried, it is certainly the best I've have recently. Cognac aging lends layers other barrels just don't, totally right for this brew. 697 charactersryannosaurus, Dec 28, 2014

4.83/5  rDev +7.6%I decanted A Deal With the Devil into my snifter at cellar temperature. This should be fun.
It pours languidly as if thick and weighty, a sheet of tan foam fizzling up gradually and then dying away. The color is intense, murky blood red. Probably as close to looking like blood as any ale I've seen. Bonus!
Potent vanilla, oak, leather, and butterscotch fume up from this stuff in excess, along with a mix of fruits that aren't only sweet-smelling, but a little tart, too! Like raisins, dates, and prunes accented with a fair amount of lemon zest. Maybe a little maple or molasses in there? And I swear I can detect the essence of hops to an extent., kind of as part of that lemon zest quality. A fascinating and tantalizing aroma.
I just took my first sip. Jeepers. This is no mere beer. This an atomic bomb of cognac, vanilla, and oak followed up with a raiding assault by a merciless menagerie of various fruits. A battalion of dark fruits leads the attack, with a smaller regiment of brighter citrusy fruits (along with some peach or nectarine) providing support. AND YET... I'm pretty okay with being visiously attacked by these intense flavors, because they carry out their brutality in a pretty well integrated, orderly and balanced fashion. I even get fine touches of earth, yeast, and nuttiness in the finish. A little bit of noble hops as well. Overall, it's very much like a boozed-up dark fruitcake. And the booze is cleverly concealed, by the way.
The body is massive and thick and sticky, and just... over the top. Nice.
This here is a special little barleywine. It's got insane intensity of flavors, and incredibly, all the complexity and balance necessary to harness that intensity. Not only sweet, but kinda tangy, and with that leathery, slightly bitter swagger that always makes an ale like this interesting. It's got character to spare. 1,861 charactersKuaff, Nov 30, 2014

A. Pours moderately thick with a deep mahogany color with amber hints. Fine bubble head. Moderate to high viscosity. 
S. The nose is caramel, booze, boozy oak, dark chocolate, and toffee. The cognac is present. 
T. The taste follows the nose consistently with major notes of cognac, toffee, vanilla, marshmallows, hazelnuts, figs, and bread pudding. Certainly boozy but not unpleasant - I mean this is a beast. There is sweetness but it comes through to balance the flavors and blends to the flavors. 
M. Smooth for the abv, moderate carbonation, and FULL body. Sticky. 
O. This is an excellent treat. Very big beer. Bold flavors makes this one worth the acclaim. I'm happy I was able to try this so I do not need to search it out. Anchorage brought their A game. 808 charactersmacher0, Sep 21, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +4.7%Not meant for the faint of heart- this massive taste of ale is a high testiment to what ale can be and not of what it should be. With its high succulent charm and slow-sipping rewards, patience is rewarded in such high culinary delight.
A Deal With The Devil shows a highly viscous weight with its decant. Layering upon the glass with such sugary weight, it seems to crawl into the glass all by itself. Its tawny mahogany color gives way to a breadth of aromas that stimulate the senses with brown sugar, toffee, molasses and sweet fruity booze. Those cognac tendencies show full force as the flavors favor grape, caramel, umami and black-strap molasses.
As the middle unfolds, the booze-soaken fruits of apples, dates, figs, raisons, plumb, cherry and peach are all represented, but done so in a dried and pleasantly oxidized kind of way. With such tang, heat and sweetness, that session easily gravitates to a sipping session rather than a drinking one.
And as the most subtle of sips latch onto the taste buds, its finish is long-lasting, deeply saturating and luxurious on the palate as each decadent sip reaches deeper and deeper into the taste buds for a lasting dessert-like slumber. 1,193 charactersBEERchitect, Aug 30, 2014

Pours a mahogany brown color with some purple--and it pours very viscous looking-and a big light brownish yellow head. The aroma is magnificent coming off this thing and you can smell it across the room. Big dark fruits, figs, oak, molasses, brown sugar, coconut, maybe some vanilla, yum. Flavor is huge sweet brown sugar, figs, cognac, lots of chewey oak, leather, more brown sugar. Good lord it is sweet and intense. Incredibly smooth for the ABV and very little boozy alcohol heat presence. Cheery and thick mouthfeel with low but still present carbonation. What a treat this is. Worth every bit of hype and one of the best Barleywines I have ever had.
Batch 2 bottle not quite as rich and viscous but still darn good. This years seemed a bit more one note than before, with less coconut and brown sugar, and more molasses. 902 charactersBMMillsy, Jul 13, 2014

Batch #1
December 2013
37 degrees Plato
IBU 60 
Galaxy hops
Barleywine aged in cognac barrels for 11 months
APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, medium-thicker looking, light tan head with great retention. Dark maroon red or brown body with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a ring leaving some dots of lacing down the glass. Beauty. 
SMELL: Cognac, oak, vanilla, coconut, red fruits and lots of toffee on the nose. Bold for sure. Some caramel and butterscotch accompany the cognac and oak as well. Alcohol for sure, and some spicy aromas. Very bold and candy-like. Excellent. 
TASTE: Cognac, oak, toffee and butterscotch up front. Very sweet and flavorful. Lots of barleywine and alcohol as well. Big finish of toffee, caramel and butterscotch sweetness, some spicy alcohol, with oak, vanilla and sweet cognac from the barrels. Excellent. Bold and lingering aftertaste is mostly sweet with a touch of bitter hops under all the sweet caramel, toffee and cognac barrel flavors. Perhaps a touch more bitterness is necessary to balance out all the sweetness, but this is plenty interesting, complex and enjoyable. 
PALATE: Medium-full body with medium levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down silky smooth and finishes sticky. A good amount of heat lingers. Excellent feel for the style. Big, silky, sticky enough and some well measured heat. You'd never guess this was 17%, and it's much fuller, creamier, and less abrasive than the competition. Class. 
OVERALL: This was really, really good. It's definitely a sweet beer, but it's big, full bodied, thick, flavorful, and very complex in the flavor profile. A touch more bitterness might help push this into the next stratosphere, but as it is, it's a beauty of a beer and well worth checking out if you can. Would love to see a bottle of this with 5 years on it, and am very much looking forward to the next batch. Awesome beer night Dooper. Cheers! 2,016 charactersJeffo, Jul 09, 2014

A: Pours a ruddy deep brown with a bubbly and thin light brown head that faded into a faint light brown collar. 
S: The cognac barrel definitely dominates with scents of boozy raisins, brandy and red grapes. It's also very musty and earthy smelling. Definitely some damp basement. There's a note of mild chocolate as well.
T: I get some warming booze and very smooth barrel flavors, rich notes of leather, dark chocolate, and earthy subtle hops, very mild leaf tobacco,barrel spices, brown sugar, caramel and some toffee. Woody barrel finish, with dark fruits, brandy, and rich chocolate fudge lingering in aftertaste along with bitter earthy herbal hops. Booze soaked raisins and dark chocolate dominate overall.
M: Extremely velvety carbonation, rich mouthfeel, smooth with warming booze but not hot at all. Drinks like a beer with much lower alcohol. Very rich and full, but super soft and airy at the same time. Extremely impressive could sip all day.
O: Take any other 17% beer fresh and it's hot, but this tastes like its been cellared five years in the bottle. One of the better barleywines I've ever had, and definitely the best one I've had fresh. Really delicious and amazing mouthfeel, and really impressive all-around. 1,285 charactersscottfrie, Jul 02, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a wine glass at a Shelton Brothers tasting at the Wine and Cheese Place.
A: Pours a murky reddish brown with a small amount of tan foam, head dissipates fairly quickly, leaves a nice trail of suds on the glass as you sift it.
S: Very aromatic, toffee, caramel, biscuit comes out as it warms up, boozey fumes if you get close enough.
T: Sweet molasses, roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, toffee, booze; all of the flavors which were out on the nose come together for a big party. There's so much going on from start to finish you keep discovering new flavors after numerous pulls.
M: Full bodied, one of the thickest beers I have ever had, very chewy, a dessert in a glass.
O: This is one of the finest barleywines I have ever had the pleasure to drink. I couldn't quite pull out any traces of the cognac barrels but I am sure it is probably hiding in there somewhere waiting for a more experienced palate. Be careful with this one, it will sneak up on you given how smooth it is! 995 charactersGet_Lowell, Jun 20, 2014
4.86/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Tasting at The Wine and Cheese Place. There were 4 bottle of this and I got two pours + another half pour. Poured into a wine glass after having a few collaborations between Anchorage and various breweries.
A - Pours nicely into a wine glass with a murky syrupy light carmel color with minimal head and minimal carb. This one coats the glass nicely and looks thick and chewy
S - Smell is loads of carmel, sugar, maple syrup, with hints of booze
T - Taste follows the nose here. Maple Syrup followed by carmel and hints of dark fruits that blend together to form an amazing taste. I thought this taste better than King Henry and I am basing this review off what I thought of King Henry a couple weeks ago. This one is so smooth and it hides the 17%+ very well. There is only a faint hint of booziness in this but nothing on the finish or anything that lingers. Carmel, Maple Syrup, Cognac, then dark fruits and hints of molasses
M - This is a very thick chewy viscous barley wine. Definitely a full bodied beer with minimal carbonation. 
O - This is the best barley wine that I have had so far. Some people may not agree, but I love the sweetness to this beer and I think it is perfect for masking the 17% beast. I may have to seek this one out. 1,249 charactersdrmcleod10, Jun 19, 2014

Appearance - Has the color of black strap molasses, and looks about as close to the consistency as a beer could look, with a very viscous feel and legs that really linger when I tip the glass to see the liquid wash over the side. There is only about a half finger of dark tan foam and it dissipates fairly quickly, leaving the slimmest of ringlets around the edge of the glass and zero lacing.
Smell - Rich, sweet aromas waft out of the glass, with flavors of dark salted caramel, molasses, maple syrup and buckwheat honey. There are hints at woody tannins, but I think most of the flavor profiles imparted by the barrel aging are more in the vein of port wine and rich, passionfruit syrup/jam, which I would guess comes from the Galaxy hops. I don't get any citrus or bitterness whatsoever.
Taste -The immediate impression that comes to mind is sorghum and syrup, almost like if you were to take whole grain pancakes and syrup, then infuse them into a beverage. It's not sweet enough to be straight up syrup, and the grain base definitely plows through to give this one a great flavor profile. Again, the notes of molasses and buckwheat honey are present, with the caramel being less noticeable than in the smell. There is also a hint of french vanilla and notes of candied figs and dates--again similar to port. I'm stunned at how well the booze is hidden. Not that it's unnoticeable, but that it's a bit of a surprise that we're in 17% range.
Mouthfeel - Full bodied--about as full bodied as any beer I've ever had--and low carbonation, which ultimately plays into the syrupy impression the beer gives. Very viscous and lingers on the palate long after the liquid has been swallowed, which is nice because you can sit and appreciate the flavors and give yourself some time to absorb the high levels of alcohol.
Overall, just an otherworldly beer. Even though this beer is listed as an American Barleywine, the barrel-aging has definitely taken over in the primary characteristics and gives it a very English feel with big sweetness and lots of grain. I wish I had a full bottle of my own, because I would love to pour this into a brandy snifter and sip on it over the course of an hour or two. And with the low carbonation, I can imagine it would hold up pretty well over a couple days--you could possibly even decant it without severely impacting the overall profile of the beer. I hope against hope that Anchorage produces this beer again and that I can actually procure some for myself. 2,652 charactersLambicPentameter, Jun 12, 2014

Appearance - Wow. It pours like fake milk in a cereal commercial. Murky reddish brown. Small khaki head. Thin collar.
Smell - Cognac. Dark caramel. Oak. Lots of brown sugar.
Taste - Viscous caramel. Cognac. Sharp fruitiness. Apples. Grape. Then brown sugar. Oaky finish. Thick syrupy sweetness. It's even a little hoppy.
Mouthfeel - This is thicker than any beer I've ever had. Medium low carbonation. Not very boozy, though.
Overall - This is serious. Good, but really sweet. 543 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 11, 2014

A - Pours a hazy brown, light yellow foam on the head, settled nicely (poured by a sommelier)
S - earthy and sweet, classic BW profile and a standard for all BW's
T - Impossible to describe it's complexity - subtle booziness almost caramel winey sweetness
M - Incredible, similar to a great wine, soft on the palate

Cola-dark and impenetrable. No head. 
Smells like 17%. Blast of fruity booze. Flat and sweet. 
Not nearly as strong or sweet as anticipated. Really rich, deep, and full. Mouth-coating and marvelous. Dark fruits, hints of spice. Stewed and delicious. Carmelized brown sugar. Lingering, tobacco-esque finish. Big and bizarre and rewarding. 
This is a sipper and a sharer, but this beer is very nice. Highly recommended. Would love to encounter again. 481 charactersAgentMunky, May 08, 2014

Pours a muddy maple syrup with no lace and no head. Huge, thick, oily legs really coat the glass though. 
Nose is boozy. Maple, brown sugar, caramel and dark fruit. Rich and very robust.
Opens maple, brown sugar and caramel. Boozy in the middle with some nuttiness and dark fruit. End is sweet and sticky molasses. Some woodiness and leather too. Aftertaste of maple with just a very light tartness. Delicious! 
Full bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and rich in the mouth and goes down heavy and viscous. Messy finish with a lingering, sticky aftertaste. Just right!
This isn't quite Perfect Storm or even King Henry but it certainly belongs in the conversation of top barleywines. Great complexity with an excellent feel to tie things together. 841 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 06, 2014

4.55/5  rDev +1.3%look: 2 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle from Churchkey in D.C. Split with a few buddies.
The beer looks like a muddy cola. Brownish gray and murky with an inch of thick, khaki hued cap. Not a very nice looking beer. However, every other aspect of the beer (all of the important attributes) is fantastic.
The aroma brings the cognac front and center. Additional notes of toffee, oak, booze, leather, brown sugar. Fabulous flavor, carrying every delectable whiff of the aroma into the taste. Rich and smooth. Delicate on the palate with a gentle, silky finish. 17.3% abv?!? Dangerously drinkable. Teeming with flavor, this is a beer to sip and savor. A top notch example of the style. I'd love to have this again sometime. 689 charactersHuhzubendah, May 05, 2014
4.52/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle into chalice.
Pours dark brown, small tan head, little lacing.
Aroma is huge dark fruit, fig, date, spiced plum, vanilla, oak, subtle Brandy, and a slight mintiness.
Taste brings fig, date, vanilla, oak, definite Brandy/cognac character. Also a slight bitterness I'm assuming from the hops which helps to balance out the beer and keep it from becoming cloying. Very nice.
Mouthfeel is pretty on par with English barleywines. Medium with soft carbonation. Sweet finish.
Overall, yes it's great. It's fantastic, but the best of the best? Probably not. Would love to have some to age. Would pull out port qualities that would make it even more interesting. Boozy for sure, but I find it hides it better than most Bruery booze bombs. 741 charactersMarcWP, Apr 30, 2014

4.49/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Heard that Bier Stein got in a case, and that they were going to do 4 ounce pours for "only" $6 a pop. So I hustled right on down to get my fair share of abuse.
The beer pours an impressive tawny brown color with very good head retention and good lacing. The beer is every bit as impressive on the nose, as I picked up considerable milk chocolate, cherry prune, vanilla and toffee. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this decadently rich beer. The beer is almost viscuous on the palate, and mouthfeel is soft,creamy and very full. The finish is also quite long in this sweet, rich beer, and I'm amazed by how well the alcohol is integrated into the flavor profile. Yes, you can tell it's a big beer, but there's no heat or heaviness on the palate from the 17% abv. 
A very impressive beer, and while enjoyable, the beer was so rich, 4 ounces was more than enough. Nevertheless, this is one of the better barleywines I've had in quite some time.
One of the more amusing comments I heard from the manager at Bier Stein (Dave) pertained to the beer's drinkability. He noted that you really couldn't tell this was a 17% abv. beer, that it really drank like a beer with only 12% abv. I suppose that's true, but 12% or 17%, this is a sizeable BW with some serious alcohol to it. 1,297 charactersJohn_M, Apr 07, 2014
4.48/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance- Received with a tiny bit of head. The head is a creamy light beige with hints of tan and light burnt umber while the body is a deep chestnut brown that shows hints of beige and khaki in the light. 
Nose- This is absolutely delicious. This hits all the notes you want a barleywine to hit and I'm surprised that this is described as an American barleywine because it doesn't smell like one. Huge notes of toffee, caramel, coconut, and vanilla. Light notes of chocolate and cocoa. Even minor butterscotch. I really enjoy smelling this beer so much that it's almost a shame to drink it. 
Taste- Dominated by leather on the front and this leather continues to permeate through the flavor profile. Some tobacco. The intense malt notes of the aroma sit in the middle and while they are all there they don't seem to have the presence that they had on the aroma. Definite vanilla, toffee, and caramel. Slight butterscotch- minimal notes of chocolate and cocoa. The hops that seem to characterize this as an American barleywine come through stronger than they did on the noes. Slight woodiness with citrus notes that build to candied fruits on the finish. This is definitely a great beer but I think that I prefer Abacus. It's been sometime since I've had Abacus so I'm comparing from memory. I could compare side by side but the 5.50 for a 4 oz pour is too much in my opinion. This does hide the alcohol quite well but it is there. It seems more like a 12% than a 17%. Slight burnt caramel that tends toward popcorn. Definitely the best American barleywine out there and without a doubt, a great beer. I think the slight hop presence mars what could be a brilliant beer but that's mostly my preference for English barleywines. 
Mouthfeel- Between medium bodied and heavy bodied with some carbonation and tons of syrup to the texture. This makes it seem thicker than it is.
Drinkability- This is a very dangerous beer. There is an alcohol presence but not 17%. I don't know if I would spend 30 on a bottle for myself but if I did, it would go down too quick. Great deal as a part of the Upper Lip flight.
Overall- Definitely a great beer but I don't think I can rank it as high as most have. This is partially a result of style but I do truly think that it isn't as good as Abacus. A must try, especially if you can get a small pour. 2,340 charactersartoolemomo, Apr 06, 2014

A: Dark brown with a good amount of carbonation and a thin tan head
S: Heaven. Such deep and rich notes of caramel, oak, vanilla, molasses and maple. 
T: A very small sip is all you need for an absolutely explosion of flavor. Rich caramel, molasses, oak and lots of maple syrup. The alcohol is ridiculously well hidden, and although you don't taste the burn of it, you do get a very pleasant mouth numbing sensation from this beer. It really takes over every part of your mouth.
M: So thick and luxurious, but the carbonation is still very present which makes the mouthfeel on this beer amazing and special.
O: When I walked out the door to go to the bar and try this beer, I had a feeling that this might unseat my previously favorite beer or at least match it. Most of the time, those types of feelings are inaccurate, but in this case it was dead on. This beer meets the hype. Holy shit. Its amazing! 931 charactersanteater, Apr 03, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow, only one full review of the amazing beer since October? A month ago I saw a whole pallet of it, wrapped in plastic and ready to be shipped south, in the Anchorage Brewing Company's facility. And some other pallets had already moved in that direction. I couldn't find a bottle of it for sale in Anchorage, though I had only missed the release by having been a week late getting home and not arranging for a proxy buyer. 
The narrative of the scoring review is from notes in a dimly lit bar. Humpy's. While having a conversation with a friendly feller whose name I don't remember and who dropped $10 for an 8oz pour of this 2013 DWTD after I told him what I was drinking, and offered him a sip. ..
Continue reading after the scoring sections for a good story that beer geeks should enjoy….
In low light it is unclear whether or not it is murky. In retrospect, i doubt it. It appears to be mahogany in color and has little head or visible activity. Still, it's quite attractive. 
I first notice plentiful boozy esters, but the often associated boozy heat is minimal. Earlier I find the aroma vaguely fruity, citrus and with the caramel elusive but detectable. Later the caramel becomes more prominent and cherry fruitiness emerges too. 
It tastes surprisingly hoppy up front, thru the middle and even into the finish. That hoppiness includes some citrusy hop flavor as well as some mild bitterness. Other elements include cherry/fruity tartness, and the rich caramel sweetness that balances perfectly.
Perfect carbonation, high viscosity, rich and with a full body. Wicked smooth.
This is an extraordinary beer from an extraordinary brewer.
So I’m on my way home to Alaska. My buddy in Iowa has some of this beer he made over a year ago that is pretty flipping good. Though he has never had M, he modeled it after M based on things he had read. It kinda reminds me of Hebrew Jubilation 16. It weighed in at around 14.5%. So he put some in a bottle for me, with the plan that I would go see Gabe at Anchorage Brewing, share the homebrew with him, and maybe get some feedback and tips on the brew. That all came to pass. Gabe liked it, said “I dig it.” Then came the feedback. The oak and bourbon were a little overdone. Then the advice. Next time oak/bourbon part of the batch and not the other part. Then blend it together. Even play with different proportions in a glass before blending the whole batch, and use that experience to guide future decisions. It’s pretty cool that Gabe took the time to do this, and show me around. Again. He’d gotten a whole bunch more huge oak fermenters since the last time I was in there. He showed me the last pallet of DWTD that was about to be shipped to the states. I mentioned that I missed the release and had a nice vertical of Bourbon County with me (08, 09, 10, 12) that I’d be willing to trade if he knew anyone that had any. He found me a bottle and we commenced the deal. Then he told me that last years was on tap at Humpy’s and he’d had a glass with his lunch. I made a bee line over there to try it. The bottle I traded for will go back to Iowa and be shared with my friend who sent the homebrew attempt at M. Good story? … And the good news is that he is making exponentially more DWTD next year. I forget how much, but orders of magnitude more. He had to rent another building to hold all the barrels. 3,382 characterssprucetip, Mar 25, 2014

Two 5 oz pours
Smell is of dark liquor, dark furits, figs, bourbon, cognac, maple syrup, carmel, and just thickness
had a slight head that goes away fairly quick. off white
mouthfeel is thick and slightly carbonated. coats the mouth and throat for a few minutes after swallowing..
taste/overall - this is a new standard for barley wines and barrel aged beer in general for me. over 17% and I feel I could drink it for hours (unless my liver quit working). so smooth and luxurious with a depth of flavors that is remarkable. Had not even heard of this beer 3 days ago and heard about this tasting. after reading about it I knew I had to try it and I am very glad I did. sounds like this stuff never comes around. higher alcohol and even better balanced that Sucaba which is damn impressive. they balanced the booze and the cognac barrel flavor so well with this beer and in the end all you taste is a cornocopia of flavors from dates, carmel, figs, bourbon/cognac, maple syrup, etc.. I really hope they put more of these out for sale some day as I will not forget this beer.
As a side note: the only bummer was the extreme price gauging done by Belmont Station with this tasting. I know this beer is expensive, but $10 for a 4-5oz pour??? that sucked, but oh well. 1,303 charactersderftron, Mar 19, 2014

It's a punishment for such a good beer to pack SUCH a whallop. Let me make this very clear, a 12 oz serving of this beer is a good buzz for an average sized adult male. 2 and you're in for a wild night.
Admitted this was the last beer of the show, but it should have been the first! This hands down is the best barely wine I have ever had. Beautiful dark plum flavor balanced by richness of the alcohol makes an amazing pairing. It's like being a kid again and looking up at the starry sky on an ink black night and relaizing how incredibly complex the universe is. You don't drink this beer, you embrace it in the deepest hug you can and hold on for the ride. 847 charactersVincent_bros, Oct 12, 2013

S: Big esidual sweetness on the nose; candy, caramel, cognac with some chocolate covered raisins and figs. A nice, pronounced Earthiness lends a hand on the nose as does some tame vanilla
T: Big sweetness meets big booze upfront, the flavor rumble royal picks up and body slams the palate with dark fruits in the way of figs, dates, raisins, some dark cherries, caramel, toffee. The booze is very well disguised and is it ever so dangerous! Layers upon layers of decadence, flavor and sweetness. The finish is a little hot and sweet from cognac but nice, warming and coating on the way down. A true dessert beer.
M: Big ol body on this mofo but it seems to get a little hotter on the back end, the longer it sits on the palate which gives a thin appearance at times. This beer was still all heart though!
O: Fantastic. I would love to have more of this in a bigger serving to accurately judge because 3oz was just not enough! 1,092 charactersbarleywinefiend, Mar 26, 2013

The name is fitting. I have no reservations saying that this is the best barley wine I have ever had, hands down, bar none, not even close. This beer needs to be bottled! I can't even explain in words how indulgent this beer is. Mouthfeel is smooth as butter. As smooth as any oatmeal stout but thicker and a little chewy. It's got that dark ripe ripe fruit and malty taste of a barely wine but just more dank. The flavors are so balanced it is ridiculous. It also tastes of rich toffee, caramel, malt, and wood. A little more boozy as it warms but barely. My mouth and lips are numb from all the alcohol. A real treat. 735 charactersReeseMax3, Feb 10, 2013
4.9/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 32oz growler into a snifter. Appearance is dark brown with ruby highlights around the edges. A thin white ring of bubbles form around the edges of the glass.
Smelling this beer is addicting. Smells of vanilla, oak, cognac, toffee and raisins. Wow
Taste follows the nose. Starts with vanilla and oak, then the sweet flavors of cognac toffee and dark fruits. Very complex and very balanced. Absolutely no hint of the 17.3% alcohol. 
Mouthfeel is sticky. very light carbonation. 
I didn't get to try this at the Alaska beer and Barleywine fest but I was very excited when I saw it at my local beer warehouse. I will definitely be first in line for this next year at the GABBF. Thanks for making this amazing beer Gabe, please put this in bottles 760 charactersTheBrewViking, Feb 06, 2013
4.93/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This monster of a beer had an Original Gravity of 1152, resulting in an ABV of 17.3%, making it easily the strongest beer ever brewed in Alaska. It took over 4000 pounds of malt to brew this beer, and four separate 3.5 hours boils to fill just two 110 gallon used cognac barrels. Gabe Fletcher brewed it back in February and then let it age in the wood for over 8 months. What's even more amazing is that this is a single malt, single hop beer, quite unusual for a barley wine. So how does it taste?
In a word: Amazing! No, make that two words: Freakin' Amazing! First off, tasting it, you would never believe that it is north of 17% alcohol. It is so smooth and deep that I would have guess more like 12% tops. It is incredibly complex, with a balance and depth of flavor profile that has to be experienced to be believed. I first tasted it the day before the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Festival and I immediately knew it would win first place; it was just that good. Once again Gabe Fletcher has pulled off a brewing masterpiece. A Deal with the Devil indeed. I'm starting to wonder if he didn't meet a certain gentleman at the crossroads late one night and make a deal for the power to brew these sort of beers. After all, if Robert Johnson could do it to learn how to play the guitar, why not a brewer? 1,312 charactersReswald, Feb 04, 2013

Barleywine aged in French Cognac barrels from the 1960s. 
A - Served a murky Carmel brown with ruby streaks. A light tan head forms and move to the edges, but never fully fades. 
S - Red wine, oak, Carmel, toffee, raisins, cherry. Lots going on already. 
T - It starts with lots of red wine and dark fruits, the the wood and Carmel flavors come in, then warm vanilla sweeps in at the end. Very layered an good. 
D - Silky smooth and the alcohol is so well hidden. Light carbonation and a medium to heavy body as expected. 
O - I first heard about this beer from Gabe last summer. It was brewed for the AK Barleywine fest, which I missed. I was very happy to hear that this was still on. Very good and I am thankful that I got a shot to try this. 783 charactersHuskyinPDX, Jan 29, 2013
