4.83/5  rDev +9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Enjoyed a 2013 last night with my old man. 
Everything about this beer just defined the word smooth, from the pour itself through to the finish. Nothing jumped out about any particular flavors, just tremendous balance throughout. The 3+ years of age (plus 12 year-old Elijah) have done this brew wonders, as the barrel has been tamed down to a wonderful subtleness. It shows itself just enough so you know you're drinking something barrel-aged, but that's all - something not often said about a big stout, such as this. In fact, considering the rather muted barrel and lighter, smoother viscosity, I could have probably drunk the entire bottle, which I normally can never do with any bomber. Curious how this tastes "fresh," but with the $30 price point, that's likely to only happen with trade.
Cheers! 805 charactersKBlodorn, Mar 05, 2017

4.39/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A: The beer is jet black in color.  It poured with a quarter finger high dark tan head that died down, leaving a thin webbing of bubbles covering the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of bourbon are present in the nose along with hints of honey.
T: The taste has lots of flavors of vanilla from the bourbon barrel aging—once it stats to warm up the bourbon also becomes prominent as well. Notes of honey are present in the finish.
M: It feels full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This imperial stout is big and bold.  It tastes strong, but does a good job at masking most of the alcohol from the taste.

3.52/5  rDev -20.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.5For the record, Elijah Craig 12 Year is my go to bourbon, so there might be a bias. The aroma is nicely nuanced with the bourbon all the same. Notes of coconut, vanilla, and oak barrel show up, but conceal the base stout somewhat. Flavors of vanilla opens it, closes it, and do everything else in between. There are gentle touches of smoke and roast also near the back end, but otherwise the simplistic nature of the base beer really lets things down. At least the bourbon presence rocks (duh!) I also like how easygoing it is for 11%, however - the honey creates a dry finish that counteracts the sweetness some. Oak tannins also keeps the mouthfeel dry (but slightly astringent). This one is a decent barrel-aged stout that showcases one of my favorite bourbons nicely, but is a letdown in most other aspects. At $30 a bottle, I don't need to have it again.
3.52/5: Good, but at $30 I may as well just buy regular Elijah Craig bourbon 937 charactersThisWangsChung, Jan 18, 2017

L - Very dark with mahogany edges. A finger of brown head that dissipates to a ring on the edge with decent amount of lacing.
S - Bourbon and oak, not a lot of sweetness. Drier than a lot of other BA stouts I've had initially but some caramel roast as it warms. 
T - I get a lot of bourbon and black pepper. Gets a little sweeter as it approaches room temp. Surprisingly clean taste as flavors don't linger on the palate which is unexpected from something as heavy and slick. Lacks the usual roasty chocolate and coffee notes experienced with other BA stouts. Flavor is definitely not what I had expected. Not in a bad way, but different than other BA imp stouts. The bourbon/alcohol here is also different than I've experienced from other BA stouts. There's a certain astringency present that one would get from a neat bourbon. A lot of very subtle and mellow flavors going on. Interesting. 
Side note: I'm getting a very intriguing, very slight and fleeting, taste of lavender. Could be attributed to the honey..? Maybe I'm just making it up....  who knows. 
F - Beautiful mouth-feel. Not as thick as other imp stouts but it's not a bad thing here. SG and viscosity work perfectly with the carbonation. Pretty awesome, really.
O - Very interesting flavor profile. Really enjoyable as it's unexpectedly different from any BA stout I've had to date. Highly enjoyable, but hard to justify the price tag. 1,445 charactersbob_roberts, Jan 02, 2017

aromas of woody oak, vanilla, leather, subtle bourbon & chocolate, caramel. not overly pungent but quite nice. 
taste follows nicely, molasses, chocolate, bourbon, caramel, honey, vanilla, roast, touch of booze on the fish. medium bodied with a nice creamy texture, gives hint of marshmellowy sweetness. 
overall definitely a class BA stout, but its still hard to justify the over the top price. 446 charactersHyptochrons, Jan 01, 2017

Tastes of black liquorice, coffee, vanilla, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, and hints of scotch.  There's a light sweetness to this one.  The wood notes from the barrel age come through more as I sip it.
Thick and slightly oily body, with a moderate amount of foamy, dry carbonation.  Quite smooth for the style.

The smell is very sweet. Vanilla, almond, roasted pecans, coffee, and dark chocolate. The taste is even better! The bourbon and honey comes through right away along with brown sugar, more roasted nuts, and chocolate. Also a lingering vanilla flavor makes this one quite sweet which is just fine by me. It is an incredibly smooth beer and has one of the best feels, easily up there with the other world class barrel aged stouts that I've had. Overall it's a special beer and is definitely not worth 30 dollars but for a special occasion this fits the bill perfectly. 699 charactersaoampm, Aug 07, 2016

Pours nearly black with faint ruby highlights and 1.5 fingers of brown head that leaves a solid sheet of melting ice cream lace as it recedes.
Smells of dark fudge, toasted brown sugar, coffee grounds, dried dark fruit, maple syrup, vanilla, bourbon, and fireplace smoke.
Tastes of more rich fudge and strong coffee, candied dried cherry, plum and raisin, melted brown sugar, boozy bourbon barrel, charred wood, dried vanilla and faint bitter hops.
Feels big and strong. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Finishes dry.

Look: Half inch of dense foam. A little bit of lacing. It fizzes up a bit when you tilt it side to side. Nice-looking stout, but it doesn't have the typical BA stout look to it. 4.0
Smell: Tons of bourbon and cocoa powder and an oaky spiciness to it with a bit of dark fruit in the background. Subtle and layered. 4.25
Taste: Follows through with the bourbon and cocoa, and the oak barrel is still assertive. Some bitter hops on the finish balance it out. 4.0
Mouthfeel: Nice stickiness but not the fullest body. 3.75
Overall: A great BA stout. 4.0 576 charactersccg, Jun 24, 2016

Look - dark, dark brown.  Not quite black motor oil.  Good bit of foam head upon pour which dissipates over time.
Smell - typical imperial stout.  Some cocoa, but not getting much bourbon on the nose... at least not as much as I expected based on smell from other Elijah Craig 12-year BA beers.
Taste - cocoa and coffee are the two that really come up big.  But nice roasted malts, descent carbonation on the taste.
Feel - Smooth.  Really nice.  Not much heat but the bourbon taste is still present.  Cannot stress enough: smooth.  On a scale of 1 to 10 on mouth feel, I would give this a 7.  Little bit thinner than I expected but by no means thin.
Overall - very good beer.  I enjoyed this very much and it's actually a 22oz bottle one can enjoy by themselves (but don't drive afterwards).  Would enjoy this again, but unfortunately the price tag sometimes prevents that.  In the end, no one the enjoys BA imperial stouts will be disappointed. 969 characterseifster82, May 14, 2016

Medium to heavy mouthfeel that coats the mouth. Minimal bitterness.
Glad I didn't miss the opportunity to have this 2012 in a trade. Due to the $30 price tag, I can only see myself enjoying this every couple of years. Decadent treat! 420 charactersSaulFox, May 09, 2016

taste: Perfect companion to the nose. All those flavors in a wonderful blend. My favorite variant so far. 379 characterscindyjeffsmith, Apr 10, 2016

Nose is a delicious blend of caramel, roasty attributes,  and whiskey.   Taste is an even better blend of the nose attributes.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly a bit thin for the ABV, carbonation good,  and the finish sweet and bitter that doesn't linger.  Good, very much so. Worth the price,  debatable. 403 charactersjakecattleco, Mar 21, 2016

4.73/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52015 Vintage, Bottle Run 2: into a snifter, it pours blood red color as it's leaving the bottle but looks black in the glass with a 1 finger foamy tan/brown head that was full of tiny bubbles, dissipating very slowly and leaving good spotty lacing that slides down on the side I drank from and foamy rings on the other side. 
Smells of chocolate, bourbon, oak barrels, peat moss, coffee grinds, cocoa powder, espresso, vanilla, smoked grains, charred wood, hot fudge or brownies, earthy notes and some faint piney hops. The bourbon is very present but not dominating, letting the smoked malts and chocolate malts swirl into a complex and wonderful aroma. Like the other FiftyFifty Eclipse variants I've had, this aroma was excellent and what I expected.
Tastes similar to the nose with rich chocolate, bourbon, oak barrels, peat moss, coffee grinds, Hershey's chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, espresso, vanilla, and then some fruity notes like raisin, dates and plums, wet tobacco, brown sugar, molasses, candied sugar or Belgian yeast, and then more vanilla and coffee. The Elijah Craig bourbon whiskey taste is distinct and meshes so well with the roasted malts, barrel notes and hop accents that it leans towards the spirit flavors slightly over the beer base. After each swallow the vanilla shows up again along with toasted coconut, maple syrup, brown sugar and smoked grains. The longer it sits the better it gets, and the hops come out more with some piney notes, lemon zest, tea leaf and peppery spices. The ABV is masked completely and this is a slow sipper that I wanted to somehow drink at a pace below slow so more dynamic flavors could come out an hour later. That didn't work out (slowing it down), but this was a great brew which I thoroughly enjoyed.
Mouthfeel is creamy and buttery smooth to the point of being slick as it slides down with mild carbonation, a light alcohol burn and a thick, chewy feel that makes the body seem heavy even though it's only medium to heavy. There is a slight bitterness that's coffee-esque, with a finish that trails off on the sweet side and has a nice mix of cocoa, brown sugar, piney hops, toffee, bourbon, smoked wood and vanilla. It fades like a Frappuccino with a shot of bourbon in it and a sprinkle of dry citrus hops and roasted chocolate malts. It really was a pleasure to dink and a beer I highly recommend and will seek out again. 2,392 charactersCHickman, Mar 12, 2016

Pitch black, no head to speak of.

Tons of caramel and vanilla in the nose with heavy roasted malt and chocolate. The taste doesn't have the sickly soy sauce like sweetness that can bury these beers for me. Thick, viscous feel without leaving too much sweetness in the finish. 357 charactersPhigg1102, Jan 30, 2016

Will buy and drink this again. 330 charactersKratman, Jan 25, 2016

L - Pitch black on all fronts. A finger of brown head with no lacing.
S - Bourbon is so huge even after one year. A tinge of alcohol. Milk chocolate, cherries, and oak.
T - Bourbon and a pure alcohol taste clash, but it isn't exactly "hot". Lacks the usual chocolate, coffee, and overall roasty notes from stouts. Bourbon does lend a subtle sweetness and there is some oak to be had, but overall this is falling flat.
F - Thick enough I guess, but a far cry from what you'd expect from a massive 11% barrel-aged imperial stout. some touches of alcohol, but they don't burn. It actually might be too clean on the finish.
O - It's an ok BA stout, but not worthy the money. Many, MANY other Ba stouts are more readily available and are better in overall quality. Seriously, if I find out you spent $30+ on this I will come to your home and slap you. 864 charactersThrewRedButter, Jan 01, 2016

Let's get it under way, I've got the Purple Waxed Fifty/Fifity. I might have to review this brew every season. For this year's tasting let's describe it for the masses. First things first, how did she pour? This year she poured just as exceptional as every year. Nice Dark Black sexy body with a deep Mocha Wig. She is looking Beautiful tonight! 
How does she smell? First waves of subtle dark fruits..(light oxidation). Second waves of chocolate covered Almonds. It's deep with the fragrance, yet not holding attention. Light char with notes of malt sweetness. She's aight to the nose! 
Ahh! The flavor! This thing hits you harder than some MTX 1200 Watt Subwoofers in a GMC Sonoma playing Frank Sinatra. She hits hard but in a classy way. The first initial flavor is, of course, Honey Sweetness that anchors notes of Chocolate. Second flavor brings that Almond aroma to life. It's that rich toasted almond flavor that I dig in Elijah Craig Bourbon. Third wave of flavors come in with toasted grains and slight Barrel Char. This finishes Sweet, Dry and Boozy with bitterness hitting the palate at full force. The aftertaste though is Banging! Sweet Chocolate covered Almonds with a tight Char note. It's a great aftertaste. The feel is upper tier but not saying anything to add to the brew's greatness. It's feel is Medium-light with so-so carbonation. 
Overall: I keep it humble, IMO this brew is worth the coin. It is classy with the right amounts of Roasted Malts, sweetness and Barrel Notes that are not so agressive that you feel like you just got Bourbon Raped! The flavors on point and are to my liking. The only thing I cannot dig is its Boozy finish and its mouthfeel. Even though it's not offensive, it is just not adding dimension to the brew. This brew would be on "OMG" status if it had more heft in its Mouthfeel and a smoother finish. The brew is Outstanding and I will drink again. This Brew is Recommended! 1,963 charactersShroud0fdoom, Dec 27, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Having had a handful of Eclipse stouts, I can say that this is a good one. Aged in whiskey barrels and brewed with honey, it had a thick body and rich aromas off the pour - chocolates, vanilla and coffee, something vaguely tannic... The feel is smooth and dense, with honey's sweetness melding into a caramel/molasses complex that builds on the warm rich roasted malts. Sweet and decadent, augmented nicely with booziness. The only detractor, if you didn't know, is the price-point - these bombers run about $32 around here. Worth it, but tough to make repeat buys. 565 charactersGreywulfken, Dec 26, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Serving Type: Bottle (2013)
Consumed: 12.19.15
A: 4.5 Pours nearly black with a bit of reddish-brown around the edges. Small, light tan head that dissipates rather quickly, but leaves a bit of lace in the glass.
S: 4.5 Lots of dark and milk chocolate on the nose with a pretty strong oak presence, bringing bourbon, vanilla, and caramel. Roasted malt aromas and molasses are pretty mild by comparison, but it’s still there. Some raisin and toffee come through as the beer warms.
T: 4.5 Flavors start off sweet with marshmallow, vanilla, caramel, and strong bourbon. Roasted malt and coffee build and seamlessly start to take over the experience from the sweeter flavors. Blackberries, molasses, and a tiny bit of oxidation work in before a light lingering bitterness and coffee finish things off.
M: 4.5 Good body and really nice carb. Not the thickest imperial stout, but not too thin either.
O: 4.5 Definitely an exceptional BA stout. Lots of really great flavors, but also nothing too unique, which is kind of this beer’s downfall. For the price, you would hope it would be substantially different from BA stouts that are half the price, but it’s not. Definitely worth trying, but not something to stock up on. 1,224 charactersTele, Dec 22, 2015

Taste boozy with an underlying bitterness I think is common to their stouts - Cognac Masterpiece had the same flavor. Good mouthfeel - thick, although not chewy, but still thicker than many stouts. Overall very good, but short of great. For my tastes, I wish the beer were a tad (just a tad) sweeter. Two, as other have mentioned, the price point really makes you more critical. Still glad I tried it though. 476 characters_RL_, Nov 04, 2015

A: pours a dark brown, practically black. head is light cappuccino hued and remains throughout the drink. good looking brew, not much to complain about. 
S: bourbon oaky aroma greats. chocolate and vanilla. smells sweet and from what I understand you cant smell sweetness. okay fine, sweet chocolate aroma. not much roast, smoke, or coffee notes in my opinion. 
T: first sip is loaded with roasted coffee notes and sweet, sweet chocolate. milk chocolate. there is the mildest amount of boozy heat, but it is basically a nonfactor as this beer should have a little bit of bite. a little bit of roasted bitterness in the finish as well. but balanced by the sweetness it is not ridiculously acrid. 
M: really smooth carb on a full bodied brew for sure.
D: not sure if this is super hot or even remotely hot fresh, but it has aged gracefully and I have no complaints. the booze is faint and fitting. the bourbon has diminished over time, but it's not like it is non-existent at this point. really exceptional stuff and worth checking out. the price tag was one of the heftiest I have spent at $30 for the bomber. not sure if I will be doing that again until I start making more money. 1,279 charactersJimmys, Sep 11, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow! You expect a lot at such a high price tag. Paid $27.99 at Beverage Warehouse in Winooski, VT.
Eclipse did NOT disappoint.
L: Deep dark black. In a pint glass with a direct beam of setting sun on the other side of it, I could just barely see a hint of ruby in one tiny spot of the glass. The rest was pitch black. Lacy half inch of head.
S: Sweet, alcohol, chocolate. Intense.
T: Holy wow. Like an entire bar of the best Belgian dark chocolate dipped in Bourbon. A tiny hint of the espresso and mocha. Others have mentioned Vanilla, but I couldn't detect it. Mostly sweet chocolate and alcohol. But no bitter, biting after taste. Very smooth and clean.
F: Smooth and full, lingers slightly on the tongue, then gone. Very sweet. Very delicious.
O: I'm seriously impressed. The inflated price tag demands a stringent assessment, but Eclipse (or at least this Elijah Craig 12-Year variety of it) lives up to the expectations. Not the sort of thing you could drink every day, but certainly something stout lovers should sample at least once. 1,046 charactersKGilmour, Sep 05, 2015

Medium bodied and a bit sticky with a moderate carbonation. 371 charactersMonkeyknife, Aug 20, 2015

A:  Deep black with a lovely creamy medium brown head.

T:  Superb.  Slightly sweet with well integrated alcohol.  the chocolate malt is present as is caramel and toffee.  Slight pleasant bitterness on the finish.  
F:  Appropriately full, with a creamy smoothness that finishes a little thinner than expected.

4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Solid dark brew, topped by a good size lighter brown head. Very good retention, and wide fields of lacing.
Nutty, boozy aroma. Honey, roasted malts, nuts, caramel, coffee, alcohol, oak, bourbon coming through relatively mild, but building with warmth.
Very smooth flavor. Sweet, but not overmuch. Roasty, but not exceptionally bitter. Strong bourbon notes, but not overpowering or too sickly-sweet.
Chocolate and coffee from the malt; vanilla, oak, and bourbon from the barrel; nuts, honey, and toffee.
Unbelievably smooth mouthfeel; 11.9% and you'd never know it. Silk. Could be a touch thicker, but it's far from thin (think: cheaper, thinner egg-nog, whereas Ten-FIDY is the good stuff).
I guess if I have a complaint, it's that the brew comes across very, very smooth, but not particularly deep or complex. I would love a slightly stronger stout base for the brew; the barrel character in this one is very well integrated, but I don't get as nuanced or complex a flavor profile as I do in FW brews or BCBS. 1,015 charactersRoguer, Mar 08, 2015

4.39/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Bottle shared by Curran tonight.
Pours a pretty dark black, with a small fizzy mocha head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells really quite delicious- like bourbon soaked brownies, hazelnuts, vanilla, and roasted malt.
The aroma's a bit better than the taste on this one. It does taste a bit like a bourbon-soaked brownie sundae- so much chocolate, bready malt, roasted malt, vanilla, cream, and sweet, out-front bourbon. It's not quite as punchy as other Eclipses I've had, but it's certainly really tasty anyway.
This could be a bit thicker, but as it is, it's still substantial. The body can't quite live up to other barrel-aged stouts of similar caliber, though. This is really creamy and silky, almost like it's on nitro.
Not the best Eclipse variant I've ever had, but it's still a really well done barrel aged stout. 827 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 21, 2015

Nice creamed coffee color head that stays around for a good while before dissipating to a nice sticky lace. Initial smell and you can really pick up the aromas that the quality of the Elijah Craig barrel gives. At first glance it appears as it would be thicker on the mouthful than it is but that said, the non-syrupy feel actually works perfectly with the quality of the bourbon as it allows the flavors to come through without the viscosity getting in the way. There's a great balance between the slight sweetness of a barrel aged stout and the dark, toasty flavors of dark chocolate, coffee and oak tannins from the barrel.  Very smooth. Overall this is very well done and worthy of the praise they receive. Definitely worth the price to try at least once. 776 charactersmj81, Dec 25, 2014

nose: bourbon, oak, vanilla
taste: initial sweetness, bourbon, vanilla, hint of berries, fading into chocolate which remains in a mild bitter finish.
I like this beer, but I can't say it lives up to its price point. 284 charactersjohn0721, Dec 25, 2014

A - Dark, dark brown, almost black with small reddish hue.  Hardly and lace or head.
S - Booze and coffee.  Yep, soy sauce is there too.
T - Delicious.  Big bold flavors.
M - Just enough carbonation, just enough bitter to quell the sweet.  Finish is boozy but surprisingly clean.

A - Black with a moderate tan head that fades quickly leaving only a nice dusting.
S - Greta bourbon and vanilla without overpowering the other notes of cocoa, dark chocolate and brown sugar.
T - Much like the aroma. Such strong flavors yet so balanced and coordinated. A slight a sweetness which helps it stand up to those strong flavors. The medley of flavors lingers nicely.
M - Thick and chewy with a low carbonation.
O - Fantastic! I love this beer!!! 489 charactersGJ40, Jul 11, 2014

3.93/5  rDev -11.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Let's start with- this is an extremely well made beer. That said, it didn't blow me away like some other bourbon barrel beers have, especially for the price. I actually preferred the four roses to this one. My problem is that it just has way too much of a caramel note to it from the whiskey barrel. Too sweet, and to cloying- like caramel corn. That just makes the beer too heavy and one dimensional for me. I'm still enjoying it, but I wouldn't buy it again. 460 charactersGeorgiabeer, Jun 24, 2014

Thanks to mdfb79 for this - Split into 2 hotel tumblers 
What better way to cap a great day of beer drinking
A: Pours a dark brown body with a real murky look. Nears black at the core and starts to thin out towards the edges. A small film of oatmeal colored fizz forms over and dispels quickly down to a swirl within the glass. Leaves behind only a few mild dots of stick. Has more alcohol legs to it than anything. 
S: Smells of bourbon, brown sugar/molasses, chocolate malts and earthy oak up front with lots of dark roasted grains/oats present throughout. Definitely has a sweetness to the nose. I get a touch of soy umami going on and the honey is in fact pronounced in the aroma. Finishes off with a flash of boozy alcohol but it is not stingingly so. Smells very nice with lots of roast grain character.
T: Taste is sweet as well but with a mouth puckering bitterness and astringently dry finish to it that cuts through all the malt syrup. Loads of toasted caramels, dark grains, oats, and a touch of vanilla crème with just a whisper of smokiness to it. The Bourbon is really subdued here but very nice how well it gets incorporated with all the other components. Big molasses presence, a touch of soy, some dark fruit notes like plum and again I find the honey manifests in the flavors as well. Has a wetted wood and charcoal likeness with just a smidge of licorice there. Alcohol is obvious but manageable which is nice. A damn fine brew.
M: Full bodied with a thick and syrupy feel at first. Then comes in an upper amount of constricting bitterness combined with some slightly astringent tannins that pucker and dry the mouth out. Alcohol warmth well noted. Pretty sleek otherwise with a smooth coat feeling in the finish.
D: Not my fav BA stout and it comes with a bit of sticker shock but still a very good one at that and worth checking out for sure. Starts off big and thick with a saving grace of hop bitterness to it. I would say the barrel notes seem pretty mellow here and I am not certain I could differentiate between the other variants without a proper side by side. I am up for the challenge however. 2,170 charactersNugganooch, May 02, 2014

Pours dark black with a one finger tan head, which fades quickly to a small disk of foam. The aroma has bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt, toffee, dark fruit, toffee, and coconut.Smells incredible.
Tastes incredible. Sweet, without being cloying. There's bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, roasted malt, toffee, dark fruit, toffee, caramel, and coconut. Even though I can taste and smell the bourbon with ease, this is not a hot or boozy beer. Very well made.
Medium bodied with low carbonation. Silky, creamy, and very easy to drink. Well worth trying if you get the chance. 598 charactershardy008, Apr 15, 2014

Pours pitch black with a finger of brown foam. No transparency when held to the light, great lacing and retention. No visible carbonation, all around great looking beer 
Smells of strong oak, bourbon, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar and molasses, figs, currant, and alcohol. Everything blends together wonderfully, this is a lot of fun to smell 
Taste mixes and matches with the smell. Upfront lots of oak and bourbon, but also strong fruit notes- lots of currant and fig. Chocolate and coffee malts follow soon after, finishing with notes of vanilla and molasses. Finally a bit of booze on the finish
Feel is thick and heavy, alcohol drinks pretty warm
Overall good, still very strong with the booze and fruits which I figured would have been long gone sixteen months later 852 characterslordofstarside, Apr 15, 2014

A - Bonfire-log black. Thin, fleeting ochre head.
S - Vanilla ice cream. Sweet, sweet bourbon. Caramel. Soft bourbon notes reward inquisitive sniffing. Coconut candy.
T - Reprising the nose, with a chorus of sweet and mellow bourbon. Velvety cocoa powder. No smoke, no char, no peat. Lightly toasted malt, but not particuarly toasty otherwise. I would have liked a little more of these classic stout flavours to go along with those already offered, but its delicious nonetheless.
M - This beer is a slender dancer albeit with great balance. 
O - What this beer lacks in depth and layering it makes up for due to its remarkable poise. It hides its abv. wonderfully; I have never had such a strong beer with so little heat. Put simply this is a beer with sweet, mellow-bourbon flavours in which all the elements are beautifully harmonized. Perhaps the first beer I've head where the overall score is higher than any of the constituent scores. Very,very good. 984 charactersabeeronthebeach, Apr 06, 2014

4.54/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours with a light to medium thickness on the body, dark brown head with moderate sized bubbles, and a finger worth head. Head settles in and is lightly present only in the edges of the glass. Carbonation is low in glass but present. 
Smell: Bourbon forward. The bourbon brings rich tones of vanilla, toffee, and cherries, oak. Slight burn from the alcohol which is not offensive, instead with brings a welcome layer of depth. Milk chocolate tones and lightly roasted coffee grounds. The big barrel character wins out in the end but lets so many other characteristics make an appearance.
Taste: The bourbon seems to have settled a little better on the taste but is still a robust presence. The palate is greeted by a menacing vanilla, milk chocolate, and lingering oak. The body is a slightly alcohol burn, cherries, and some medium to dark chocolate. The finish is some lingering alcohol, easy vanilla, and dry chocolate. 
Mouthfeel: This brew doesn't have the huge, rich, creamy body that so many other elite imperial stouts do but all the traditional stout flavors and barrel character still come through so well. For what it lacks in rich heavy body, it makes up for in elite drinkability.
Overall: I would definitely but this in the world class BA stout category. The lighter body give it a very different drinkability but in no way is a negative in the long run. The barrel character is absolutely top notch. I bought a bottle of Elijah Craig 12yr bourbon at the same time as this bottle and I hope it packs this type of punch as well. 1,557 charactersKFBR392, Mar 15, 2014

Aroma of bourbon and rich black chocolates is very soothing. Taste is also dominated rich black chocolate notes with some medium bourbon notes with really rounds off the rough or bitter edge of the base stout.

4.18/5  rDev -5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Let me start out by saying this beer isn't worth the money.
A - It's a nice looking imperial stout. It has an impressive head for a BA stout. Nothing to detract from appearance.
S - Bourbon dominates. Fairly smooth. I think I get a bit of the honey.
T - Too much booze. It's 9.5%. Come on. The honey finish is nice, but the overall beer isn't very impressive.
M - Too thin, too boozy. It's smooth, but it's not a world class stout mouthfeel.
O - How this sells is beyond me. Such a ripoff. I was hoping this highly rated version would be good. Incorrect. BCBS destroys this on every level at half the cost (if your store marks it up) or 1/3 the cost at reasonable prices. Drinking this makes no sense. It's a decent tick, but that's it. Don't recommend buying any of the eclipse beers. 790 charactersnrs207, Feb 13, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A - 5.0 - This is an amazing looking beer. Brown/black opaque beer with a nice mocha head that is very fine and sticks around. 
S - 4.75 - Tons of bourbon, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, sweet cream. It smells very sweet and a little boozy. 
T - 4.75 - At first you get a lot of bourbon and booze, but then it gives way to chocolate, cocoa, woody and smokey characteristics. Caramel and vanilla are in there but very faint. You can definitely tell this is barrel aged as it's very smooth despite the ABV. 
M - 4.75 - Thick, chocolate milkshake type mouthfeel. Little bit boozy, but at 11.9% ABV it's reasonable. The aftertaste is a nice roasty, chocolate/coffee. 
O - 4.75 - I went back and forth on the idea of buying this for a while. It's very readily available but so expensive. 
There's two ways to look at this. 
FIRST - A lot of people wouldn't think twice about spending this much on a bottle of wine or hard liqour. In addition to that, it's barrel aged for at least 3 months, and then most of the bottles on the shelf are early 2012 or 2013 (they probably sit because they're expensive) so they're already aged for basically another year or two. This could be aged for a long time and would probably only get better. So looking at it like that, it's reasonable. 
SECOND - For the price of this beer (28.99 + tax), you could easily make a good batch of homebrew, or buy multiple 22 ounce bombers or six packs of something else. It's really expensive. 
IN CONCLUSION - I'd say it's worth it if you really care about trying different kinds of beer. Maybe it's just the mystery of what a 30 dollar beer really tastes like, but I had to get this out of my system to be satisfied. And in addition, I could probably never get an elijah craig barrel to age an imperial stout in, and that's assuming I could make an imperial stout this good in the first place, which I haven't had the patience to do yet. I wouldn't buy it again, but I'm glad I got it to try just once. 1,979 charactersISmith87, Feb 10, 2014

Bottle No.: BR/2 2012
Served in a snifter
The beer poured dark brown/black and slightly thin for the style. A super tight and creamy, inch-tall crown of mocha colored foam topped the liquid. Patchy streaks of lacing trickled down the glass. The head eventually faded to a thin, lasting ring.
Bourbon dominated the aroma initially. There was a slight chalky yeast presence as well. Intense vanilla bean and sweet cream notes. Loads of coconut. As the beer sat, the bourbon faded a bit and more subtle nuances came forth. Some molasses and powdered cocoa were noticeable.
The flavor profile was a bit more punchy and complex than the nose. Dark fruits came through super strong. Plums and raisins were most apparent. Loads of brown sugar, vanilla and sweet cream. Mild roasty notes. Touch of anise. Good dose of semisweet chocolate. The finish contained some oaky, woody, slightly tannic notes, along with subtle hints of earthy hops. As the beer warmed, the chocolate flavor intensified and took on a fudge-like presence.
The mouthfeel seemed slightly thin for the style initially, but it somehow turned thicker and richer later in the session. Amazingly creamy and slick on the palate.
Elijah Craig (12 Year) from the FiftyFifty Brewing Co. was the first of the Eclipse series I have sampled to date. Although this beer was quite interesting and surprisingly drinkable, I was anticipating something a bit more remarkable for my $30. 1,517 charactersDamian, Feb 06, 2014

Pours a very dark black color with no light getting through the edges. An abyss of color. There is a nice dense half inch creamy tan head that forms then recedes down to a nice thing ring around the glass.
Aromas starts off with barrel sweetness. Notes of molasses and caramel are present with some nice notes of vanilla. Then there is some nice chocolatey fudge in the nose along with some great slight roasted coffee notes. Bakers chocolate sweetness can be perceived in the nose as well. 
The flavor is exquisite. Notes of chocolatey fudgy syrup with some nice caramel and molasses barrel notes. Slight vanilla spice, mixed in with the cocoa notes. The beer is very rich and complex with delicious mix of chocolate, both dark and milk, and some nice roasted notes complimented by delicious barrel sweentess. Mouthfeel is nice and thick with some mild carbonation to keep it in balance. 950 charactersJoEBoBpr, Feb 06, 2014

A: Pours pitch black with smallish one finger mocha colored head. Some decent retention and some spotty lacing.
S: Bourbon was apparent the second I popped the cap on this one. Very nice bourbon aroma in your face, some vanilla, bitter chocolate, a bit of oak.
T: Following the nose, there is lots of bourbon flavor. A nice alcohol heat mixed with chocolate, vanilla, and some earthy oak goodness.
M: Thick and creamy coating the tongue nicely. A bit of burn from the alcohol. 
O: Very nice BA stout. Combines some of my favorite characteristics of a big stout and a nice bourbon. Other than the price point, this brew is a home run. 705 charactersrichj1970, Feb 02, 2014

Extremely creamy and frothy head 2 inches tall and then settling in nicely. Leaves tremendous lacing after each sip. Nose is subtle at first but then breathe in once more and oh my! Chocolate and the slightest back hints of bourbon. Other stouty flavors abound as well. Nice! Taste is superb. Not heavy chocolate in the finish but just thin malty sweet goodness that lasts on the tongue. The bourbon flavor creeps in the back end quite nicely as well. You want more after each sip. At this point it's aged well so dare I say I want to session this?! 638 characterscoriswrasse, Feb 02, 2014

A- Pitch black pour to seven glasses for all of the great attendees of our annual StoutFest. On top of the black beer there is a small light tan cap to about a finger with decent retention. Falls to a small-ish foamy ring leaving spotty lace and some nice blankets too.
S- Seems a bit deeper than the previous offerings of Eclipse and lacks the huge dark fruity dominance. Whiskey is deep with fresh oak, vanilla and general Bourbon notes. Cocoa, caramel and some sweets in the backdrop.
T- As an Elijah Craig 12 drinker, I can appreciate this. The whiskey feel just reminds me of the greatness that EC12 is for a $30 bottle. Strong, in your face fresh toast oak and peppery Bourbon whiskey with a nice sweet vanilla finish. Base is still a bit weak IMO and that is true in all the Eclipses we had. Cocoa, caramel and some toasted nutty malts.
MF- Medium thick body with moderately high carbonation. Semi-creamy but lacking texture for a, basically, 12% stout. Finishes with some peppery Bourbon heat and faint roasty bitterness.
Probably my favorite Eclipse of the night because I truly recognize the EC12 feel. I love that "in your face" Bourbon character of Elijah Craig and the dilution into this stout works out pretty well. Still wish the base stout had more character but I can appreciate this. 1,367 characterscbutova, Feb 01, 2014

Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for sharing this
2013 bottle
Appearance: Dark, dark brown, black at its core - pours with a medium tan head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves some nice streaks of lacing
Smell: Big malts and big whiskey - rich malts, with a load of roast, burnt, and chocolate - tons of rich caramel, molasses, and burnt sugar - dark chocolate, with a touch of semisweet chocolate, and some fudge - the bourbon aroma is big, but it's nice - the Elijah Craig is nice, with some nice woody and vanilla notes - sweet, but it works with the overall complexity
Taste: Chocolate, caramel, and bourbon - burnt chocolate malts, dark chocolate, semisweet chocolate chips - very solid, nice stout base (not surprising, as the other Eclipse stouts are great) - burnt, roasty notes, with some coffee - big, cooked caramel, and molasses - the bourbon flavor is quite potent, but it's nice - bourbon, vanilla, wood, and some booze
Mouthfeel: Borderline full body, nice carbonation, smooth, finishes mostly dry with some booze
Overall: Another color of wax, another win
I'm not sure if this is better than the Heaven Hill Rittenhouse Rye, but it's approximately as good. The stout base is great, with a ton of chocolate, and the bourbon is nice. This is definitely a nice sipper. 1,294 charactersangrybabboon, Jan 16, 2014
4.11/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Straight black. A touch of dark brown. Small creamy tan head. Drops to a small, almost nonexistent cap and slightly larger collar. Minimal carbonation on the pour. 
Smell: Coconut, caramel, toffee, vanilla, and a solid roasted malt. A touch fudgy with a solid brownie batter and chocolate push. An touch of alcohol as well. The barrel influence is heavy, dropping all sorts of bourbon. Butterscotch. A touch of cocoa.
Taste: Rich roasted malts. Loaded with chocolate, both sweeter milk and slightly darker cocoa. Bourbon is assertive and makes everything a bit boozy. Layers of vanilla, coconut, butterscotch, a touch of oak. Fudge and some brownie. The bourbon is actually really mellow and adds a nice dimension to the base stout. A touch of cola syrup thrown in the mix. 
Mouthfeel: Slick with a full but not syrupy body. Minimal to moderate carbonation. Surprisingly clean. 
Overall: Light urple.
 The Rittenhouse Rye managed to blend better, but the whiskey here is stupid smooth and easy going. 1,017 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 16, 2014

appearance: ebony black with a cappucino head, decent lacing.
aroma: bourbon seems hidden. Smells like malted milk balls, vanilla and honey a little caramel corn and finally some alcohol esters.
taste: molasses leads the way and in a big way followed by coffee and chocolate. Whiskey finally comes out of hiding with an immediate warming sensation
mouthfeel: supple and smooth
overall: expensive but worth it, this is an unbelievably tasty beer. Definitely belongs in the top tier of Bourbon Barrel Aged Stouts. I have another of these celaring and am debating going back to the store to see if any is left. 736 charactersfx20736, Jan 12, 2014

A - Pitch black with a half finger head that holds magnificently long. Huge amounts of lace that stay on the glass throughout. Perfect!
S - Bourbon, chocolate, honey, graham cracker, vanilla, toffee. This has such a good and balanced aroma. I can detect so many smells that all blend together. Perfect!
T - Follows the nose completely with some toasted marshmallow. Fn amazing how the bourbon just comes together with the chocolate notes. You can taste the 12yr Elijah Craig greatness in every sip
M - Silky, frothy type smoothness with no burn at all. The mouthfeel I've always looked for in a big bourbon barrel stout
O - Well, I did it. Perfect 5s. I've never had the pleasure of having this fresh but the year and half put on this has put it in a class of its own. This is truly sublime and a masterpiece. The price point is pretty insane but after tasting this I can almost justify it. Just perfect! 954 charactersrjp217, Jan 11, 2014

4.34/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Looks almost a cola-like consistency as opposed to the motor oil look that a lot of BA stouts have. Slight head and pretty strong lacing. Looks enough to style.
Smell is sweetness, vanilla, bourbon, and chocolate. No real hop presence. A nice smell.
Taste is very bourbon-y upfront and finishes with a nice sweetness. Oak, vanilla, and chocolate all show up an meld together quite nicely. You taste the EC barrel here for sure. Maybe a slight char taste but no real bitterness.
Mouthfeel is a touch light, but still very smooth. I prefer my BA stouts generally to be a little chewier, but I can't really complain about this one.
Overall this is an interesting experience. You taste the bourbon in this one more than most in the style, I appreciate that a lot. As a whole, this makes me think of a more bourbon-forward Event Horizon. The only problem that that is that EH is less than half the price of this. If you are really into bourbon I can certainly see having a high appreciation for this series. In the end though, I would have a hard time justifying a repeat purchase given the price tag. 1,100 charactersmechamifune, Dec 31, 2013
4.11/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.2522oz bottle, purple wax sealed, and 11.9% ABV for bottle run numero 2 of 2013. Is there an online instruction manual, or something, that describes how to open this sort of enclosure, without picking away at the wax with a knife?
This beer pours a fairly deep dark black abyss, yet with prominent basal cola highlights, and two chubby fingers of densely foamy, weakly puffy, and broadly bubbly chocolate milk brown head, which leaves some nice low-pressure system lace around the glass as it slowly abates.
It smells of mildly astringent rye whisky barrel wood, the titular booze, dry vanilla, crusty caramel, bittersweet chocolate, the hint of the earthy floral honey quietly noted on the label, and some surprisingly prominent herbal, leafy hops. The taste is more woody, boozy barrel notes right up front, some dry, earthy black licorice, a touch of cold java, lightly toasted, but not inherently light caramel malt, a grainy besotted breadiness, a weirdly evolving semi-sour milkiness, and subtle earthy, musty hops.
The bubbles are pretty sublimely restrained, the body a solid medium-heavy weight, and quite equitably smooth, with a pleasant stab at everyman creaminess. It finishes still almost cripplingly sweet, the caramel, vanilla, alcohol, anise, honey all equally culpable. But recall, I said 'almost'.
I am not at all versed in the spirituous offerings of one Elijah Craig, so all I can discern from this offering is that it is one pleasantly understated example of a Bourbon County staple, based on the thorough, yet inoffensive effects rendered herein. The base RIS is only mildly altered, I presume, and the overall experience is quite agreeable enough - tasty, full, and sweet to a point that dessert pairing is hardly out of the question. 1,760 charactersbiboergosum, Dec 31, 2013

A black liquid with a deep cola edge, lots of tiny bubbles going up the side and feeding a big three finger mocha foam that quickly cuts in half but then sticks around with a slight island, several rings of lace followed by random patches, looks great 
S lots of chocolate fudge, vanilla, some sweet soft caramel and I'm getting some of the honey I didn't notice in the other variants, not too heavy on the barrel but has nice mellow bourbon and wood thing going on, booze is there but quite well concealed 
T more booze then the nose with some burnt coffee and char, whats on the nose is still there but doesn't mesh together quite as well, still solid don't get me wrong but doesn't quite match the nose 
M not very heavy for the color but the tiny bubbles cream it up and like the other 2013's I've had I'd plain and simply be amazed if this clocks in at nearly 12%
O another great beer from the series but I don't think its my favorite, the taste doesn't quite keep up to the nose but still great all-around 
everything I've had from the Eclipse series has been great and perhaps the number of reviews has gotten this one in particular on to the top 250 but I don't think its my personal favorite even though its awesome. 1,314 characterswordemupg, Dec 25, 2013

4.48/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52012 vintage poured into my Darkness tulip. For $30/bomber, expecting this to be really, really good.
Appearance: Dark brown pour with a voluminous creamy tan head with great retention and lacing. Expected this to be a darker pour given the reviews, but it really isn't that dark.
Smell: Big barrel character in the nose with bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and oak. Some charred wood and a bit of roast on the nose as well.
Taste: Barrel character shines with a nicely palatable bourbon taste, sweet vanilla and caramel, with a balancing backbone of roasty malt, chocolate, and coffee. Mild bitterness. A little bit of anise on the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth with low carbonation, medium body, mildly sticky, but wish the body was bigger.
Overall, I'd say I went into this with high expectations. They were met, but just barely. This could have been better for being 99/100 and 100/100. I'd give it more of a 95/100. Extremely balanced, very drinkable, well-rounded overall. Just doesn't give that extra flavor-punch to push it over the edge. For $30/bottle I might not get this again, but certainly enjoyed the bottle, and it would be a staple if it were more around $18 or so. 1,183 charactersMCain04, Dec 24, 2013

4.06/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance- Pours up a little more than a finger's worth of head which has a little retention. The head is a medium beige while the body is a opaque, dark chocolate black. Some lacing is left behind. 
Nose- Not as much presence as I've come to expect from barrel aged imperial stouts. Some chocolate, a bit of coffee. Some heat. A bitterness (mostly oaky) that is a little bit astringent, almost like formic acid. Later, some cream and milk shows. Some graham cracker, a little bit of honey. Suggestions of caramel and toffee. Swirling shows a slight sweetness- maybe cherries or raisins. 
Taste- Starts off with a good amount of chocolate (some cocoa) that has bourbon notes playing off it. Good amount of oak which builds to the finish but is surprisingly rounded. I generally don't enjoy massive oak notes but it's working so far. A little bit of heat which interacts well with the oak. The chocolate is very deep and dark and suggests notes of raisins. Light hints of coconut and vanilla start to emerge. Seems a little subdued but there is the notion that this beer will have a lot more complexity as it opens up. Unfortunately, this notion does not seem to be playing out as the beer seems to be restrained. Very approachable with a lot of balance and integration but lacks the complexity that I desire- I will suffer a bit of messiness for a more interesting flavor profile. Good to really good beer though, most leaning toward really good. Doesn't fare well in comparison to the BCBS I had last night but little does. Some ashiness and small suggestion of tobacco. Could use some sweeter notes. 
Mouthfeel- Between medium bodied and heavy bodied with light carbonation. A little chalky on the finish. 
Drinkability- Very mellow for a 12% barrel aged beer- perhaps, a little too mellow. The price is certainly steep- I won't be buying another to age. Aging this seems pointless anyway. 
Overall- Good to really good beer, mostly good. Definitely worth a try but if the 28 dollar price tag makes you pause, you are correct in your concern. I will not be buying it again. 2,081 charactersartoolemomo, Dec 22, 2013

Dark cola brown, not as black as some imperial stouts, nice dark mocha head, really thin, recedes quickly to small layer of film, ringing the glass. Opaque. 
Smells hot at first, very bourbon forward, but that mellows out. After a few minutes the aroma is incredibly balanced with chocolate, coffee and vanilla, with obvious bourbon notes as well. It's less sweet than boozy.
Taste is similar, and fantastic. It really changes after a few minutes; I was alarmed by my first sip, but things evolved so quickly. Wonderfully balanced, not cloying at all. Perhaps not quit sweet enough.
Feel is smooth and pleasant. Somewhat dry, but really easy to drink. Below average carbonation.
Overall drinkable at 9.5, my advice is to age, but what do I know. Cheers. 801 charactersrodlavers, Dec 20, 2013

Reviewed live. Expectations are sky high given the price point and the brewery's reputation. 
Served cold - straight from the fridge - and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. 
Pours a two finger wide head of khaki colour. Nice creaminess and thickness. Retention is good - about 5 minutes. Even lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. 
Body colour is a predictable opaque solid black. Nontranslucent/nontransparent. No yeast particles are visible.
Overall, it's a good appearance for an imperial stout, but isn't unique or special. No egregious flaws. I'm looking forward to trying it. 
Sm: Chocolate, vanilla, dark malts, chocolate malts, and cream. No real oak barrel character comes through unfortunately - no refined or rich character. No hop or yeast character is detectable. There is some alcohol presence. A mild to moderate clean aroma of well above average strength.
T: Dark malts, chocolate malts, cream, faint marshmallow, light chocolate, faint vanilla, and very light oak. Decently balanced and cohesive, but not gestalt. I do like it. Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour. Not particularly intricate or nuanced. 
Decent complexity and subtle. Little intricacy/nuance. I've had far deeper and more complex beers, 
Mf: Smooth, wet, unrefreshing, medium-bodied, and nicely thick. A biteen sticky. Suits the flavour profile pretty well. Suits the flavour profile generally well, but doesn't feel custom-tailored to it. 
Not astringent, oily, harsh, gushed, boozy, or hot. 
No real roasted barley, coffee, spices, or yeast. Has some alcohol presence. 
Dr: Drinkable and enjoyable, but noticeably boozy. I wouldn't buy it again at this price point. Good but not great. My companion and I will easily kill this bottle, but it's far from exemplary. I wouldn't recommend it to friends, but it's likeable enough. Not worth it.

I reviewed the Four Roses here http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/14936/64055, as good as it was I think I underrated it. Also, at the time I hadn't had as many BA stouts, the ones I had weren't all that impressive. Now I think they're possibly the world's finest beverage, making this one of the best of the best. 
As far as how the Elijah Craig is different, it's smoother, more singular on the palate (likely from age), as the licorice notes have made room for vanilla and cocoa. 542 charactersrand, Nov 30, 2013

Review #298.
Pours a nice viscous dark brown/black body, minimal mocha head with minimal retention. Lacing is spotty. Standard bourbon barrel stout here.
Smells incredible. There's that customary bourbon barrel scent- oaky, almost on the verge of fungal, but overwhelmed by a delicious smelling chocolate brownie scent. Very rich. Phenomenal nose here.
Flavour is a notch below the nose; however I get a lot of that bourbon barrel ala Bourbon County. There's a lot of similarities to BCBS, although this tastes a little more like chocolate fudge brownies than anything else. Quite decadent.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, just the right amount of carbonation. A decent bit of heat accompanies the beer, but otherwise very smooth and complex.
Thanks for bringing this one, Shaun. This is the first 50/50 Eclipse beer I've ever had, and after this one I kind of want to see what else is out there from that same brewer. Well-done, very well-constructed and nicely chocolatey with a good mix of bourbon. 1,122 charactersStevedore, Nov 27, 2013

2009 - Bottle 78
Pours a wicked dark brown almost black color, not much of a head though and pours almost flat, no light penetration even around the edges, no lacing on the glass.
Smell has a huge bourbon molasses aroma, subtle hints of dark fruit, rich toasty malt backing that makes all the other characteristics blended so not to overwhelm the nose.
Taste starts out with a thick roasted/burnt malt flavor with a bit of a char aspect, the bourbon kicks in but after four years of age the burn has mellowed, molasses and dark fruit in the aftertaste, big thick chewy body that is hampered by a very low almost flat carbonation, not quite Lost Abbey bad but enough to hurt it from being excellent on all fronts. 764 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Nov 16, 2013

The smell is very roasted and boozy with hints of black licorice before getting solvent. A little bit of vanilla and caramel. As it warms up, it gets a sweet almost candy-like vanilla scent that is deceptive smelling.
The taste is like burnt molasses with an oaked taste that blends into caramel and toffee with chocolate covered raisons and anise. Quite boozy with a hint of bourbon tang across the finish mixed with oak, roast and earth.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest to low level of carbonarion. It is earthen and very boozy but still shows the alcohol vibrantly with a little barrel presence. It is quite good and 4 years in the bottle has hardly mellowed this out but it has a soft amount of oxidation present. 929 charactersstakem, Oct 21, 2013

The scent had nice barrel aged qualities with a lot of coconut, vanilla and wood. Very light chocolate notes and a touch of caramel are also in the nose.
The flavors are strong in the bourbon and barrel, tending to brash at times. There's then a goodly amount of coconut that can be found. Some light chocolate malt flavor is hidden near the end.
The feel is so incredibly creamy and thick, it's truly beautiful.
Overall, this may have been a touch too heavy in the bourbon. Then the coconut came on strong without a balance of vanilla. As always though, it's more a matter of personal taste. 652 charactersKYGunner, Oct 16, 2013

A: Pours redish/brown and opaque with a foamy dark tan head that sticks around.
S: Big caramel, vanilla, chocolate, alcohol is pretty muted. Really nice, rich, decadent whiskey. Hints of honey as well? The bourbon is really nice without making the nose too hot.
T: More chocolate on the palate, melding with notes of coffee for a mocha finish. Caramel and vanilla big time, some marshmallow too making this a well-rounded dessert sipper. Alcohol bitterness is detectable but there is very little heat; apparently I found a good age for this beer!
MF: Creamy smooth full body with lower carbonation.
O: The sum of all its parts make this beer excellent. Great bourbon character, rich dessert notes of chocolate, caramel, vanilla and marshmallow (mocha as well), and a silky smooth and creamy body without much alcohol burn make this one really nice. 1,005 charactersScotchboy, Oct 15, 2013

5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I honestly didn't think this was going to be as good as it was. Picked up the 2012 version so it has about a year's worth of age on it, poured into a makeshift tulip (my best glassware is not here). So a few thoughts:
A - Even holding this up to the light there is virtually no color, just black, they don't call it Eclipse for nothing, outstanding.
S - Smells like that Elijah Craig 12 year whiskey, you can definitely get the boozy aromas with a bit of the honey, a little coffee as well, just an overall wonderful smell.
T - For a beer that's 9.5% this is very noticeably boozy which might be a turnoff for some but is everything I love about a good barrel-aged imperial stout. Incredibly smooth but with a noticeable bourbon taste to it.
M - This just coats your palette like a good beer should, decent amount of carbonation to for a beer of this kind.
O - I initially balked at the retail price of this beer (as well as the rest of the Eclipse series) but good god this was sooo worth it. This is the first thing I've ever tried from FiftyFifty and they have a new #1 fan. Extraordinary beer.
There I'll stop kissing this beer's ass now, but if you see it, buy it, so good. 1,184 characterswpqx, Sep 25, 2013

Appearance: Pours dark brown with less than a finger of a creamy tan head. Once in the glass the body is opaque black. Nice retention and lacing.
Smell: Bourbon, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, hint of dark fruit, and butterscotch.
Taste: Follows the aroma. Bourbon, fudge, toffee, roasted malt, and a bit of oak presence. Sweetness is perhaps a tad high, bordering on cloying.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, thick chewy mouthfeel. Carbonation is on the lower end of medium. Medium alcohol warmth after the finish.
Overall: Really good bourbon barrel aged stout. Probably overpriced, but still really enjoyable. 654 charactersJonada, Sep 12, 2013

I thought I was spoiled....
strong, pleasant, sweet mix of bourbon/whiskey with some coffee, dark fruits and vanilla(?). like a really good whiskey, I could go on sniffing this until it warms... I am expecting very much from this one; this is my 4th Eclipse in the last month. i'd never heard of it, nor known of it before. what a find! what a heavenly aroma! without grossing you out, I could probably orgasm with a constant stream of this smell into my nostrils... and I haven't even taken my first sip... raisin? plum? alcohol!
first sip.... nicely darkened fruit. nice malty, sticky syrup on the finish. a little bit of coffee. I've never wanted to nurse and embrace a beer like I have this one. I've never wanted to take my time with a beer like I have this one. I've never been so giddy knowing there's still half a bottle of beer in the frig to finish off as this one. I've never wanted to be so ALONE with a beer as I have with this one. still relishing the wonderful fragrance, another long smooth draw is utterly satisfying to the palate. my girlfriend would never understand and I hope she doesn't come home anytime soon. she's already threatened to put me in to Jenny Craig.... or was that 
Betty Ford? I get the two mixed up. maybe because it's that I know this is my last one and I don't know where to find another one until December, but I am utterly ravished with this nectar. the pliny before this cant hold a candle to it. i'm sorry. if every beer were like this, I wouldn't feel the need to rush through beer after beer to get to the next one in hopes of finding the next "god-sent" product. as I stare lustily at my STILL-half-filled glass, my ability to restrain myself surpasses ALL my expectations and I can only imagine the jealousy my girlfriend would experience if she only knew I could hold on this long for such a beautiful endeavor. another privileged mouth full of heaven and I can feel the smooth rush of bourbon-tinted wonderfulness teasing and exciting every last taste bud on my tongue- even the lethargic ones left over from my pot-smoking days are energized into a frenzy and clamoring for more. I am utterly entranced. these people who make this beer are my heroes. they have made me forget about Russian River completely. I am completely and utterly enamored with this brew. I cant hold off any longer. my youth and inexperience are coming back and I feel like a teen-ager again. I don't know how much longer I can hold back- I just wanna GULP in this last bit of my glass... must, hold, back...
okay. i'm back. I can honestly say I've never taken this long to write a BA review for any beer before. 2nd pour is just as beautiful as the first, maybe a little more head. but that dissipated rather quickly. I don't know why but I felt this internal, inherent desire to CHEW away the remaining grape-colored wax dripping off the side in suspension... I AM heterosexual... 
I don't know what else to say. this is rapture, losing-your-virginity and a firm-pat-on-your-dog's-head kind of ecstasy all rolled into one. my only desire is to relax and finish this one out in privacy. if anybody within my close personal circles is reading this, a case of this is my ultimate Christmas present and birthday present all rolled into one. hell, i'll even give you a pass for the rest of my life.
if St. Bernardus is a 5, this is a 6. I will renounce all my beliefs in modern-day science and call the earth flat for a case of this beer. umm, in case you're wondering, this is my 5.... on top of all other 5's.... 3,835 characterspkalix, Aug 26, 2013

Cheers to Rockstein for splitting this bomber with me! 50/50 is a black hole of a beer, the room darkens and my smile widens with the pour. The milk chocolate head rises super late from the black body to a cap of foam after the pour. After a few minutes in the snifter the head settles to a thin ring and leaves little chunky lacing behind with each small swirl of the glass. The looks alone tell me this is a stout to be reckoned with.
It would be tough for more complexity to be jammed into the nose of this stout. The bourbon barrel qualities pop through first with sweet, lightly spiced bourbon, handfuls of toasted coconut, and vanilla galore. Soon after come the hugely complex stout characteristics. Butterscotch and a plethora of dark fruits make up for the main body with a somewhat sweet, somewhat spicy bourbon finish. 
The flavor profile somehow manages to trump the incredibly rich nose. The barrel characteristics I mentioned in the nose go expertly hand in hand with the huge stout body. Butterscotch works from front to back but isn't overly sweet like in most other stouts that bring butterscotch. The dark fruits roll through mid palate after the barrel aging characteristics start to fade and integrate into the overall flavor. There is a crazy cotton candy like airy sweet finish that wraps this beer up beautifully. A touch of spiciness from the bourbon lasts for a few seconds after each swallow. The complexity of this beer comes together amazingly well. There is no part that dominates the others.
Just like the other aspects of this beer the mouthfeel has been nailed. The body is thick, rich and coating but fades a few seconds after each sip. A lot of these big stouts are sticky sweet but this one walks the line perfectly. A touch of warmth on the swallow cuts what sweetness is present and makes for a luxurious mouthfeel.
I could easily sip the night away with this 50/50. The balance between sweet and heat & barrel and stout make a great compliment to one another. It's rare that you run across a stout that's this big, robust, and complex that's so easy to drink.
50/50 Elijah Craig is one of the best stouts I've had in recent memory. I could easily live with a few more of these floating in my fridge. This is a stout worth seeking out without a doubt. Thanks again for the pour, Dave!

A: Pitch black with some head that dissipated. Typical stout appearance.

T: Follows the nose exactly. Lots of bourbon up front (which I love), chocolate and vanilla.
M: Nice and smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.

Right away pours that inkly black you can only find inside an Elijah Craig bourbon barrel. Smells like I dumped a few drops of that sweet sticky inside my morning joe. BIG roasty, vanilla, cacao. the bourbon notes are so delicate and subtle but right there. Soooo smooth and layered. The oh so mild sweetness lingers on the tongue forever.

Pours a clear amber that coalesces to become dead black. One finger of thick, sticky sandy brown grips the glass in full walls.
Maple syrup, molasses, vanilla, oak, a touch of toasted coconut. Sweet, rich. 
A bit of alcohol heat in the nose. Booze is just a bit more intense than the underlying stout. Sweet bourbon, vanilla, oak, brown sugar, maple syrup. A little more stout flavor would be good here, but the bourbon is nice. Not too harsh. 
Silky medium body. Creamy. Soft carbonation, a mild massage. 
Good flavor. Not the best variation ever. 577 charactersPhelps, Jul 11, 2013

A - Pitch black pour, foamy brown one inch head
S - Raisins, chocolate, cocoa, leather, oak, vanilla, bourbon and licorice
T - Lots of bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla and charred oak barrels. Alcohol is well masked for the strength; a great sipper.
M - Mouth is silky smooth, carbonation in the low to medium range with a dry cocoa powder finish. 
O - My first Eclipse and I can't wait to try more! This beer reminded of me of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout, which is to say damn good! A strong beer but the alcohol is relatively well hidden. I really like the chocolate and relative lack of alcohol. It's there but not over the top. Cheers! 683 charactersHatzilla, Jul 07, 2013

Bourbon, tobacco and cocoa come through on the nose. Obviously, age has mellowed the bourbon presence.
Cocoa, tobacco and dark fruits dominate the taste upfront with a faded bourbon note. Again, very mellow, almost too mellow for me. I find myself searching for more flavors but can't seem to find anything else. 
Mouthfeel gets creamy towards the back with a lingering cocoa presence. A bit of searching brings up the tobacco/dark fruit flavors. Clean, creamy finish. 
A marvelous imperial stout. Was it worth $26.99? Honestly, I've had better examples for half that price or even less. Still, if you're into aging imperial stouts for a very long time, this is a good investment. I bought this bottle back in December of 2012 and it's been in the fridge since. I do want to try the other varieties available. If you're a fan of imperial stouts and want something different, check this out. 1,021 charactersBrad007, Jun 08, 2013

A: Pours a pitch black with a large, dense medium brown head. Head fades slowly, leaving nice solid walls of lacing behind. Great head retention too.
S: Wonderful sweet bourbon aroma with lots of caramel, brown sugar and vanilla. Toasted sugar too. Chocolate from the roasted malt melds in nicely. Maybe even hints of coconut from the barrels? Sweet and rich smelling. Wonderful.
T: Oh yeah, really nice bourbon up front. Sweet and heavy caramel and toffee and even some molasses it seems. Lots of charred oak in there too. Heavy on the dark chocolate, kinda fudgy in a way. Chocolate turns a bit bitter in the finish with some oak from the barrels and a little burnt sugars to boot. Lingering oak in the aftertaste with just a little alcohol burn between sips.
M: Nice medium-heavy bodied. Smooth and thick.
O: One of the nicer Eclipse variants. This one is a bit heavy on the wood with lots of charred oak. I'll have to try this one fresh sometime, I wonder if the bourbon has faded a bit - this is definitely the oldest eclipse I've had (at least 18 months old now I'm guessing). Strong in the aroma but not as strong as some of the fresher variants I've had. Hard to say. Still quite good, don't get me wrong but it makes me wonder. 1,272 charactersDope, Jun 04, 2013

A: Black, looks a tad bit thin from the way it swirls, half a finger head, mocha head that retains for a few minutes. It's aight
S: Vanilla and coconut forward (very nice!), I also get quite a bit of alcohol, roasted malt... that's about it. 
T: Alcohol is a bit too much for me but it really follows the nose. I am a bit surprised though that after a year and a half, it's still this hot (and it's only 9.5%). I also taste honey towards the middle/end. It's delicious, but slightly disappointed? I think EC18 was better.
M: It's chewy alright, but a bit on the thinner side. Alcohol burn is felt for sure. 
O: It's a very very good barrel aged stout, but not among the best I've had. I am glad I got to try it though! (I will be sticking to Parabola, which is cheaper and easier to obtain for me) 901 characterssukwonee, May 31, 2013

A big thanks to fatbeats18 for sending this one over in a trade. 
A: Pours black with some browning on the edges. 1.5 finders width of light mocha colored head dissipates down at a moderate rate to a thin film. That film remains throughout the majority of the drink though, and leaves a fair amount of lacing. 
S: Dark fruits, cocoa, roasted malt, booze, chocolate fudge, cinnamon. Barrel notes are presents with oak, vanilla, and bourbon but not nearly as strong as I remembered the EC 18 year being. Still very nice though, and only improves as it warms. 
T: Lots of sweetness up front. There is a honey sweetness, then a rich chocolate fudge character. This is followed by oak and roasted malts on the finish. I get bourbon next, bitter black coffee, and vanilla. There is an aftertaste of oaky-vanilla that lingers forever after each sip. 
M/D: Nice and smooth, thicker than it looks during the pour, and fairly chewy. Carbonation on the higher end of the spectrum for the style. ABV well masked. Drinkability is good. 
O: This is an excellent beer, but its not as good as the 2011 FiftyFifty EC 18yr I had a little while back. That being said the EC 18 was one of the best beers Ive ever had. This one, although still great, had noticeably less barrel notes, and less of the chocolate fudge/cake batter sweetness that I got in the 2011 EC 18 (same base beer I believe so not sure what the difference was, different vintage, different batch, more time?). That being said, still a hell of a beer. Glad I got to try this one. Thanks again fatbeats for sending it my way! 1,637 characterszac16125, May 27, 2013

4/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Even though it was against my better judgement I acquired a bottle of this. I heard the EC 12 year was one of the best eclipses so I dropped an unseemly amount of money for a bomber ($24). I had this feeling all along it wasn't going to be worth the money since Parabola is only $15 and I was proven right. Dark black beer, super healthy head. Aroma is mild bourbon, and then I get notes of honey, not bad. Flavor was mostly bourbon, wood, more booze, touch of honey. I was really hoping for some chocolate or vanilla or coconut flavors but I got none. I suspected this beer was overpriced and now I feel vindicated. Caveat emptor. I sort of wish I had just bought two bottles of older viscosity instead. :( 707 charactersArrogantB, May 22, 2013

A- Kinda transparent for a BA Stout. Thank You Mr. Minor lacing.

T- I get a harsh rye bite out of this one. Not as smooth as I like it. Barrel character is present, some charred dark fruit and molasses is present.

A nice dark mahogany brew with a slight foamy tan head.
Awesome sweet caramelized sugar with notes of bourbon and vanilla, slight alcohol in the nose. The nose is all about the bourbon.
Taste is of the amazing base stout and the sweet bourbon and vanilla. The big malt flavours typical of an imperial stout are slightly subdued. Great mouthfeel. 
Overall a very easy drinking bourbon barrel aged beer. The bourbon barrel aging is perfectly combined with the base stout. 542 charactersalpineclimber, Apr 23, 2013

A - Poured into my Duvel glass a a nice dark brown with a rich almost two finger dark chocolate hued head that slumped down to leave a nice quarter inch head that left some light side lacing. 
S - Very nice chocolate notes here, no sweet malts. The rich bourbon is noteable from a slight distance. Smooth, rich, well rounded with light typical bourbon sweetness, faint vanilla and barrel notes as well. No alcohol on the nose either. 
T - Taste is just delicious. Would like more chocolate as there is quite a bit of bourbon. Its tasty, sure, but a bit too bourbon heavy. Would like to see more notes of chocolate like say, cocoa powder, bakers, that sort of thing. Again, its there but its all rather overpowered by the bourbon.
M - Mouthfeel is awesome though, super creamy with just a little bit of carbonation. Light bourbon alcohol as well.
O - Overall its a darn tasty beer, but, for the money or going trade rate there are other damn good bourbon aged stouts for a fraction of the cost of one of these. Glad I got to try it. 1,120 charactersrudzud, Apr 08, 2013

Appearance - Murky black with transparent edges. Not much of a head. Wispy surface.
Smell - Slightly sharp bourbon character, not quite as harsh as others. Very sweet smelling. Chocolate. Vanilla.
Taste - Lots of sugar, very sweet. Sweeter than other variants, which I don't understand. Maybe the EC barrels add sugar, but I don't understand why that would happen. Bourbon flavor is nice, rounded out by the sugars. Chocolate and vanilla.
Mouthfeel - Slick and creamier than the base beer. Medium carbonation. Sweet and barrel booze finish.
Overall - Similar to the Elijah Craig 20, without quite that great barrel character. 703 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 07, 2013

Pitch black pour with a creamy, frothed brownie colored head resting on top. Creamy retention, spotty lacing and wispy film swirl around in the brew while drinking. 
Stiff Elijah Craig bourbon scents with toasted oak, vanilla, tobacco and chocolate. Sweet and boozy, roasted dark malts, smoke and a boatload of barrel. Bullseye. 
A heavy-handed helping of bourbon right up front with sweet barrel character and oaky tannins. Chocolate, molasses and vanilla lead into the robust backbone with roasted dark malts. Boozy chocolate cake, brownies, tobacco and a dash of smoke. Finishes boozy and warm with lingering vanilla. 
Full bodied, milder carbonation, creamy, sticky and smooth on the tongue. It's a toss up between this and the EC 20 year for my favorite Eclipse treatments, both of which have a substantial leg up on the others I've tried. These probably aren't worth the $30 tag they fetch in Philly, but I still seem to keep buying them. 1,016 charactersxnicknj, Mar 24, 2013

The beer pours a very dark brown/almost black color. There isn't much head to speak of. The smell of the 2009 was very different from the newer versions. There was hardly any alcohol, but I was getting lots of dark fruit and some mild roast. I thought there was a strong raisin presence in the nose. The taste is very smooth. You can tell this beer has some age on it, but it hasn't fallen apart too much. There is a roasted malt sweetness with the bourbon mainly showing up in the finish. I'm also getting some dark fruit and mild caramel/vanilla notes. I thought there was a mild peppery note as well. The body wasn't particularly thick and there was only a little carbonation.
I liked the 2012 version of this beer more than the 2011 even though it was hotter. I thought the depth of flavor was better in the 2009 version. 1,011 charactersoline73, Mar 10, 2013

A - Appears very dark, with a residual tan head. Very dark brown with little or no ruby highlights.
S - Smells like bourbon with a good dark, roasty smell, some char, some chocolate, vanilla, cherries, leafy tobacco and some licorice. It has a definite bourbon barrel smell nicely balanced with roasted malts.
T - Taste has a deep bourbon flavor and some heat, vanilla, toffee, char, and roasted malts. S
M - Big bold and yet smooth at the same time.
O- Overall a massive brew to tackle with lots of flavors going on at once. Extremely complex and has a fuller bourbon flavor than some of the others which makes sense given the amount of time the liquor has spent in that barrel. 693 charactersStar80, Mar 09, 2013

I don't remember the 20-year being this boozy...but delicious nonetheless. Sweet bourbon booze with vanilla and toffee flavors. A bit of coconut as well. Some plum and raisin flavors with a ton of oak and chocolate...dark chocolate. Even though this is one of the "hotter" variants, it is up there for most complex of the Eclipses. Great flavors in this one. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and warming. Drinkability is surprisingly high. Overall, I love this beer. I need to drink my other 20-year bottle and review it to see which one I enjoy more. This one is pretty damn good. 910 charactersDovaliHops, Mar 03, 2013

Tired Hands glass
A: Pours really deep brown almost black. Reddish hues towards corners. Head is a light tan color. This is more head then other variations, and makes for a prettier appearance in the glass. Some lacing sheeting. Alcohol feet on the swirl.
S: I get the barrel immediately. Big vanilla and oak character coming through. Dark chocolate. Medium roast. Some blueberry underneath, like I have gotten from other ones. Some caramel flavors too.
T: Dark chocolate. Malt sweetness. Some barrel is there too. Vanilla is really nice. Blends well with base. Some bitterness in back end, but it's like a chocolate bitterness not hoppy. The mixture of base and barrel and roast and sweet is really pleasant on this brew. 
M: It's full but not epically big. 773 charactersinlimbo77, Feb 22, 2013

A- jet black, I think the negatives I've heard about the series are getting to me, but I swear this "looks light for a stout"....
S- Awesome. Everything I want in my BA stouts. Loads of oaky vanilla goodness, with some slight roastiness, but definitely oak vanilla dominant
T- more of the same, the roasted character comes through a bit more in the taste, I actually enjoy how the lightness of the body seems to lend to an urge or sense of need to drink more to coat more of the mouth to understand more of the taste...want..more...
M- Yes, the body is light. to style, not good...but know what? 50/50 makes it work, I enjoyed this part of the beer more than anticipated
O- This is my favorite so far out of the three I've had and would buy more if they weren't soo damn expensive 797 charactersGonzoHomebrewer, Feb 16, 2013

It pours a little weak looking for a stout of this level of aroma and taste. Dark brown with some lighter brown highlights, decent lacing. 
The smell is nice with molasses, smoke, subtle in a good way bourbon, cereal malt, ice cream vanilla oak. Very nice.
The taste really pops with flavor, it strikes all the right notes of a barrel aged stout: a great balance of the barrel, stout and bourbon from the barrel, it really has a perfect balance and is not hot at all. Also has some nice salt water taffy and fudge flavors on top of everything else. 
Feel is a little above good but not great, wish it was thicker but it has a nice roast and carbonation level for a beer like that. 
I can see why this is rated so high. Great stuff. 806 charactersDreadnaught33, Feb 15, 2013

A- Pours an opaque black body with amber highlights. A thin mocha-colored head rises and reduces quickly to leave a khaki ring. Leaves spotty lacing.
S- I'm straining to get a good sense of the aroma, but it's taking a lot of effort. After a bit of swirling, I get whiskey, dark fruits, vanilla, and some pretty noticeable booze (which is odd considering the 9.5% abv - I get less from bcbs @ 15.00%)
T- Sweet milk chocolate, raisons, dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla upfront, on the finish is freshly roasted grain and toasty black coffee. There's a hugely noticeable hop bite on the finish. 
M- Medium-heavy body, very low carbonation.
I was expecting big things from this brew, and I got what I was expecting - but nothing more. Didn't blow me away. It was indeed rich and complex and very enjoyable to drink. I'm definitely going to age my second bottle, maybe that will mellow out the booze which I think is the downfall of this brew. 1,053 charactersgcamparone, Feb 14, 2013

A: Pours pitch black with about a finger of tan head and a good amount of foamy lacing. 
S: Everything you would expect from a BA stout. Strong suggestions of vanilla and coconut immediately meet your nose. Look past those and you find milk chocolate, coco powder, burnt coffee, and perhaps a touch of soy sauce. Inhale deeply and you may also find a hint of tobacco smoke and a tingle of intense alcohol. 
T/M: Upon sipping, my immediate reaction is to how incredibly smooth this brew is for 9.5%—it goes down dangerously easy. Lots of chocolate and molasses character up front transitions to a roasty and slightly burnt-tasting finish. Not as much bourbon character as you would expect, but notes of vanilla and oak are certainly detectable throughout. This could use a little more body, IMO. I would characterize this as barely full bodied. Not quite as thick as I want my BA stouts to be.
O: Overall a fine BA stout. A great nose and incredibly well balanced and drinkable for a 9.5% beer aged in whiskey barrels. It could use just a little more body. More body would also help enhance what is already an impressive flavor experience. Worth the $30? Maybe for the one-time experience, but I will not be running back to the store to drop $30 more. 1,328 charactersMrDanno96, Feb 11, 2013

Head dies off to nearly nothing. Small, dark lacing freckles along the glass. The body doesn't look very viscous during the pour (understandable at its ABV).
S-Bourbon is more intricate than intense. Oak and vanilla with dancing spice. Tobacco too. Charred and chocolate but predominantly java-ish. Roasted espresso beans. Warm dark chocolate and baker's chocolate powder.
T-Flavor is very delectable. Much more complex than most Bourbon Stouts but less intense than many as well. The bourbon is again very multifaceted in its flavor offerings. Vanilla and tobacco all over the place. I don't really pick up much honey (noted as an ingredient on the label). The espresso is the heaviest flavor. The various depictions of chocolate don't slouch either.
M-Lighter for the style. Subtle, massaging carbonation. Hints of alcohol. Not overly viscous. The flavor lasts (more coffee than bourbon).
O/D-One hell of a drink. Of course, the $28 price-tag is an absolute killer. Definitely too pricey. I had to grab it when I saw it though. I really loved what the barrel brought to the flavor equation. Flavors are more toned than bulky. When I think of this compared to a $12 bomber of Bourbon County Coffee Brand Stout, this variety of Eclipse just doesn't stand up in both the flavor and price department. Worth a shot one time...unless you got plenty of cash to burn. 1,465 charactersVelvetExtract, Feb 04, 2013

A - Opaque dark brown with a 3-finger head that leaves medium lacing.
S - Sweet aromas of bourbon, coconut, vanilla, medium roasted grain and chocolate malt. . Very appealing. 
T - Bold and delicious. Sweet dark roasted grain, bourbon oak, vanilla, chocolate and very dark/dried cherry, The welcome alcohol sweetness and bite compliments the bourbon flavor. It's not too sweet though and is well-balanced with some char, light smoke and peat. Finishes with some lingering peaty/chocolate malt and roasted bitterness.
M - Medium body and light-medium carbonation. Creamy and smooth.
O - Had this served at 60 degrees and it warmed some from there. Gotta say that I like this more than Founders KBS. It is quite expensive and I can't/won't make a habit of having this on a regular basis but I sure am glad I've got another bottle tucked away for a special occasion. 923 charactersTucquan, Feb 01, 2013

Poured very black with garnet/mahogany hues in the light. Adorned by a big beige cap that left ample trails of lace. This is a very roasty and toasty imperial stout. Lots of burnt notes here, maybe even toasted marshmallow. Biscuit and caramel leading into lots of vanilla and oak. It's like someone took Blackout Stout and tossed in a spoonful of bourbon. Medium bodied and spritzy carbonation. Quite a delicious beer and always welcome in any tasting I attend! 533 charactersDmanGTR, Jan 27, 2013

A: Poured from the 22 oz bottle - after cutting through the purple wax seal - into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is black. No light is penetrating, not even at the edges. Smallish (maybe a half-finger) light-brown head on top settles pretty quickly to leave a little ring of lace behind. Good splotches of lace on the way down. 
S: Bourbon. But not in an over-the-top, in-your-face sort of way. It's integrated nicely, with strong scents of vanilla and a woody, tannic hint as well. 
T: Oooooh that's good. First impression is the bourbon. Alcohol heat is definitely felt on the palate and especially on the way down. After a couple sips and a bit of a palate adjustment period, however, I get a good amount of chocolate malt underneath the booze. Don't get me wrong, this is still a big, boozy beer and a sipper rather than a roasty or chocolatey quaffer; but there's more to it than the bourbon. There's a touch of molasses as well, but a nice, tannic bitterness at the finish provides a surprising amount of balance. 
M: This is a heavyweight. Carbonation is modest; a slightly slick sipper.
O: This is really good stuff. 1,217 charactersKendo, Jan 26, 2013
4.45/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5this was an awesome, although brutally expensive, bottle of brew. the pour is a nice rich dark brown, black chocolate color, with an inch of mocha colored lace that doesnt last long at all. the nose is my favorite part. you can really smell the bourbon in this, vanilla, charcoal, oak, and alcohol, along with honey and burnt malt. not used to honey in my stouts, but i think it adds a whole new element here that just jives perfectly with the barrel notes. flavor is just as complex as the nose. surprisingly, the alcohol isnt really present, even at room temperature. amazingly well disguised. the malt profile is huge, brown sugar, burnt oats, tobacco, and spiced rum all seem to come in waves here, flashing about. i enjoyed trying to pick out more and more flavors, i got to the point where i could pick up toasted coconut, as well as smoke. this is a beer of unrivaled depth of flavor. very very impressive stuff. a little more runny than i thought itd be in terms of feel. could maybe use a touch more oomph on the body, but then again maybe not, it seems to be complete enough as it is. decent carbonation, and a finish that is sort of bitter, sort of sweet, and sort of neither. it is quicker than the style usually allows, and i think this is chemically perfect in that regard. overall a splendid beer, makes me want to try some of the other colored wax tops, but man this stuff is pricey!
edit: i just had a bottle from last year, and it honestly drinks quite a bit better fresh. it seemed thinner, less dynamic, and no more easy on the booze front. if youve got one, break it out of the cellar and drink it now, its time. 1,634 charactersStonedTrippin, Jan 25, 2013

A: Pours motor oil with a nice dark brown khaki 1.5 finger head. 
S: Barrel characteristics really come through on this one. Surprisingly, no coffee or chocolate notes on the aroma which is usually a staple on Imperial Stouts. Some vanilla is present. 
T: Taste for me was smooth, barrel taste. Some brown sugar and molasses creamy-ness. Really surprised by the lack of chocolate or coffee taste. 
M: Smooth, medium to fuller bodied but not overly thick. First few sips left my mouth with a strong whiskey taste, as if I had taken a shot of whiskey and not beer. This dissipated as I drank more. 
O: A fantastic and unique brew. We had a discussion that as we drank it, we weren't focused on the beer, but rather on table talk. We were surprised by this and decided this is a sessionable beer. This beer is all about showcasing the barrel characteristics and not the characteristics of Imperial Stouts. Really unique and I would recommend trying a bottle. 1,024 charactersCommanderOfAwesome, Jan 24, 2013
4.28/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Consumed today but reviewed from notes later. Split two ways. Cellar temp bottle poured into my CBS snifter.
Appearance- Poured black with a tan, surprisingly fluffy head. Head fades fairly quickly but leaves a nice persistent ring. Thick lacing coats the glass. Looks like a bourbon barrel-aged stout should.
Smell- Notes of chocolate, alcohol, and molasses dominate. Moderate fragrance level.
Taste- Chocolate again, surprisingly some nuts. Bourbon lends alcohol heat and vanilla. Decent amount of oak and roasted coffee bitterness on the back-end that was missing from the aroma. Very solid, but doesn't blow me away.
Mouthfeel- Very soft carbonation, and not dry at all. Definitely a viscous component. This beer is somehow both thin and chewy, but I like it.
Overall- The alcohol was well hidden in this (I'm told its higher than listed 9.5% abv), and the flavors were good, if not mind-blowing. A nice interplay of chocolate and vanilla. Pretty drinkable. Probably not worth the $, but splitting it made it worth it. 1,027 charactersAuror, Jan 24, 2013

The aroma coming out of my glass is roasty, chocolate, caramel and coffee wrapped in a subtle but evident barrel treatment of vanilla, and sweet bourbon whiskey. The flavor starts off sweet and malty with lots of roast, brown sugar, and chocolate. The barrel notes rush in with vanilla, whiskey, light wood to remind us that this is no ordinary stout. Lingering roasty whiskey with a touch of ethanol burn lasts long after every sip. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy creamy mouthfeel. Nice stout, the bourbon adds a nice sweetness that really compliments this version. 693 charactersjohnnnniee, Jan 21, 2013

Three years of sitting? Time to take her down.
Pours an extremely dark brown...or black. Either way, it's dark. No head to view except a few bubbles. Worried about it being flat but was a false alarm. Read on. 
The smell is molasses, brown sugar, leather, apple, dark chocolate, bakers chocolate and toffee. Great smelling even after sitting for a number of years. Light booze as well but its masked rather well.
The taste is still banging. Milk chocolate, light coffee, burnt toast, booze, medicine, smoke and dark fruit. It all still hear. Slight alcohol burn on the swallow. Somewhat hoppy.
The only negative....the mouthfeel is way thin. Wish that could somehow be remedied and knock this beer outta the stratosphere.
Overall this is a great blend. The barrel does wonders to this and if you cellar it right, you can get an amazing experience out of the session. This could have probably sat for awhile longer, but imo now is the time. Great stuff. 983 characterskaseydad, Jan 20, 2013

A real straightforward textbook looking large stout. Black walnut bodied in color, with a simple microscopic bubbled creamy head that forms. The head color manages a light mocha, light tan brown, and has a good amount of presence. A little tilt and you can see a little bit through it on the edges, and a good swish brings some leopard spotty lacing.
The nose hits with a large amount of fruit. It feels black berry, currant, creme de cassis, or some other dark black fruit, a light honey sweetness matching nicely in the background, I can't even tell this came from bourbon it's so fruity, it smells incredible. A little bit of char hides in the back. It smells incredibly creamy.
The palate feels so incredibly wonderful. The sweetness angle on this beer is just "perfect". High quality milk silky chocolate on the finish. The mid palate brings all that black fruit with a honey kiss of sweetness. There's some playful carbonation on the tip of the tongue at first, but alows the silky character to just come through. There is a wonderful sooty smoke component to this also, like you could blow black ash right out of your mouth.
Overall this drinks so easily, and is one of the most perfect sweet balanced big stouts I've ever had. Finished this bottle in nothing flat. Just a great beer. 1,359 characterssmakawhat, Jan 11, 2013

4.53/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75APPEARANCE: This is about as dark as it gets without being straight up black. Only a tiny bit of dark brown light got through the very top of the glass when held up to the light. No flashes of ruby, no transparency, just the smallest touch of dark brown. A quarter-inch of coffee colored head tops the glass for a few minutes before becoming a patch-work of bubbles and wisps on top of the black sea of beer. A few bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass as well, but cannot be seen until reaching the surface. There is no lacing to speak of.
SMELL: Smells like bourbon with a heavier than usual emphasis on the vanilla. Of course some wood comes through as well and a little chocolate backs it all up. The only surprises here are the hints of raisin and the lack of a more boozy smell.
TASTE: My first sip is too cold and more of the booziness comes through in the form of a more oaky bourbon flavor. Following the bourbon is a closing wave of bitter, roasted, coffee-like malt flavor. I know this will change drastically in a few minutes though. As it warms the sweeter side becomes apparent. A slightly bitter, dark-chocolate beats out the vanilla of the nose, but vanilla is still there and the chocolate gets sweeter as it warms. The hint of raisin is still present, but only at the very tail end of the sip and in the aftertaste.
MOUTHFEEL: A decent amount of carbonation provides an appropriate amount of tickle to the tongue for this big, full-bodied beer. Like many other big stouts, this has a mouthcoating, but not too sticky feel as well – it is silky smooth. 
OVERALL: This was one of the biggest and best beer surprises I have had in a while. I expected it to be good, but it instantly became a new favorite of mine when I tried it on tap for the first time last week. I instantly knew I had to go grab a bottle…plus another to age. I don’t know how I’ll hold off, but I have a feeling it will be worth the wait. 
Anyhow, while my first few, too chilly sips were good, this is a beer that needs to warm up a few degrees. Let it sit for 15 minutes before diving in. 2,093 charactersStoneTSR, Jan 10, 2013

A - A bit thicker-pouring than the old 2010's, though it's still not as dark as I'd like. Soft light tan head. Quick reduction. Sticky lacing. Gets a bump up in score for this year. 
S - Sharp whiskey barrel. Dark chocolate, honey cake and apple. The very lightest twinge of pecan pie and alcohol solvency.
T - Woody barrel front. Light espresso, more dark chocolate bitterness. Caramel popcorn and a sweeter bourbon note balance the drink through the rear palate.
M - Smoother than expected, delightfully velvety. Medium body, semi-dry finish with an oak aftertaste.
D - Completely accessible and enjoyable. Not as tannic and overtly barrel-heavy as 2011's EC20, but definitely easier to work through. Easy recommendation here and arguably my favorite Eclipse thus far. 841 charactersAuracom, Jan 07, 2013
4/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Poured jet black with big brown bubbles, nice head retention which surrenders some spotty lacing
S: Big bourbon on the nose, booze stings the nostrils, dark rich chocolates and dark dark fruits come to mind. Whiffs of tobacco and leather are noticed.
T: Some initial heat gives way to bourbon, oak, coconut, vanilla, a one-modest two punch of tobacco and leather with a long drawn out dark fruit presence. A little hint of sourness is noted as is some charcoal
M: Well carbonated, full body, a nice creaminess exists on this but not silky like creamy decadence that I enjoy from an Old Rapsy Anny.
O: Good, but no way is this worth the price point! 655 charactersbarleywinefiend, Jan 07, 2013

Pours black, small amount of light around the edges. Maybe two fingers of tan head and very little lacing. Nice looking overall. 
Smells of sweet bourbon dominates. Maybe a bit of the barrelwood. Some vanilla. I am not as blown away by the smell as I was expecting.
Taste, bourbon, light chocolate. Barrel notes. Some licorice flavor.
Full mouthfeel with good carb.
Overall this is a nice, well done beer. But for the price, there are many stouts at least this good. Really thought this was going to be at least 4.5s across the board so really a bit of a disappointment. 589 charactersPowderhornphil, Jan 06, 2013

A: Perfectly bitch black as night with a 1 inch tan head that fades at a decent pace. Very good.
S: I get some creamy roastiness on first sniff followed by some minor honey / dark fruit scents. Some nice vanilla / charred oak notes take up the backend. Good.
T: A thick easy drinking creaminess upfront with some great balanced vanilla and dark fruit. A minor hop bite dances on the back of your palate and the end finishes with a thick creaminess. Can't even tell this is alcohol! Very good.
M: Full body with a great carbonation. A creamy thick finish. Good.
O: All in all, I can definitely see the hype behind this brew. It is so easy to drink. While this is a great beer, I still think there are better brews. If you like thick stouts, give this one a try. 841 characterssteve8robin, Jan 05, 2013

Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with a modest beige head that slowly faded. The head appeared to stick around longer than that on my 2012 Evan Williams (same tulip glass).
Smell: Mild Bourbon (less than that in my 2012 Evan Williams), coffee/roasted malt aromas, brown sugar and some vanilla notes.
Taste: Bourbon, roast malts, vanilla, caramel/brown sugar and oak notes. The finish is fairly dry with Bourbon, roast malts notes and mild hop notes. To my tastes, The Elijah Craig had a more restrained Bourbon presence than that of my 2012 Evan Williams.
Mouth-feel: Medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation.
Overall: Good beer. It really is interesting to see the impact the different barrels have on the Eclipse series. 764 charactersIKR, Dec 24, 2012

Aroma is muted however what is there is chocolate, vanilla, charcoal and well perhaps a bit of honey. On the palate is where this beer shines! Milk chocolate, vanilla, oh my mint I can actually detect mint. Charcoal is big and I also get some nice bourbon soaked woody oak. Had you never had a beer with honey as an ingredient you wouldn't know, but if you have then it is clear honey is present here and a truly brilliant addition to a stout. A very rich beer it is, thick, slick and chewy. Must say this beer would be a 5 overall, but it is a tad bit too sweet. 628 characterspmlondrigan, Dec 23, 2012

Finally getting around to trying this beer. I've been excited about this one for some time. Shared with the group during a FiftyFifty themed tasting.
The beer appears near black with a thin beige head. The aroma is vanilla, perhaps some toasted coconut, roast, chocolate, oak. Lovely. The taste follows suit. Simply delicious. A standout among the FiftyFifty Eclipse series. 
It was interesting sipping this side by side with the Elijah Craig 18 Eclipse. I think both are fabulous beers, each offering a myriad of flavors. Highly recommended. 586 charactersHuhzubendah, Nov 18, 2012

The beer pours a deep jet black, hues of dark cola brown come through when held to the light, intensely opaque. A thin mocha head appears but dissipates very quickly, leaving behind a trace of film atop the beer and no real lacing. The aroma is of charred wood, rich chocolate, sweet vanilla, bourbon and faint coffee, well rounded, extremely inviting and pleasing. The flavors are wonderfully complex, strong bourbon, rich chocolate, smooth vanilla, roasted coffee and charred wood, just as the nose lead on, a bit of molasses and pitted fruit does come to the tongue as the beer warms that gives on a touch of added complexity. The body is good, a tad thinner than other barrel aged stouts, not as creamy or motor oily as others, but still works well for the beer, the carbonation is spot on, a bit lively and zesty as it goes down with a great smooth finish.
Verdict: Another incredible rendition of Eclipse. This beer never ceases to amaze in it's depth of flavor and general palatability and each barrel variant brings out something unique and different than the others, a joy to drink. 1,141 characterskevanb, Nov 11, 2012

A: dark brown to black, not very viscous, very nice tan head with excellent retention creating a froth on top. Same as the EC 18 but with a more foamy head. 
S: bourbon and oak are slight in smell along with some vanilla. 
T: dark fruits are heavy, but this has quite a bourbon and wood flavor along with some vanilla. 
M: missing some body, but overall very good. Well carbonated with fine bubbles. Very creamy. 
O: excellent beer. When I first opened it, I didn't think it would be very good. Wrong. Hope they make it again, and make it at a less steep price ($30/22 ounce bottle). Not quite as enjoyable as the EC 18, but really close. 689 charactersHolland, Nov 01, 2012

(Aged for 1 year)
Very dark brown, nearly black in color, without a lot of visible carbonation and not much head. This does leave sticky spots of lacing down the glass. Not a particularly heavy or substantial looking stout.
Lovely aroma, especially as the beer inches closer and closer to room temperature. The familiar coconut, bourbon, chocolate, wood, roast, and coffee elements combine here for something quite lovely.
The flavor follows similarly with chocolate, bourbon, and earthy vanilla flavors combining. There is hardly any trace of alcohol harshness. This is incredibly drinkable.
Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. I think I would prefer it be a touch thicker.
Fantastic. This is perhaps the best of the 2011 bottlings. 791 charactersehammond1, Aug 31, 2012

Aromas of sweet bourbon, oak, roasted malts and dark chocolate. As it warms you get some toffee, bitter espresso and light caramel maltiness. A much more dry, bitter dark chocolate aroma than the other Eclipse series that I have sampled.
The tastes follow the nose and begin with sweet bourbon, oak, roasted malts and dark chocolate. The roasty/smoky elements continue to build as it warms into a full Bourbon character by leaving some rough boozy edges.
The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Finish is dry and biting due to the emerging Bourbon presence.
Overall this is my least favorite of the 5 variations I have sampled to date. Too smoky and acridly bitter with too much emerging straight bourbon flavor overpowering the base beer elements. 885 charactersclaspada, Aug 22, 2012

A- Pours a pitch black with a small mocha head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing.

T- Again lots of bourbon with oak, subtle vanilla bean, dark chocolate, roasted malt and burnt caramel. 
M- Medium carbonation with a thin body, especially for a stout. Has some heat the finish. Could use a bit more body. 
O- After having several Eclipses, I'm ready to say that I'm not willing to throw another $30 for any of the variations. Not a bad beer, but nothing really memorable and a middle of the road BA stout IMO. 738 charactersiadler, Aug 14, 2012

Pours a near pitch black... maintaining a slight bit of dark copper clarity. A thin half-finger of light brown head fades out to a neat collar. Great, oily lacing. Nice looking beer.
Tons of lush honeycomb and caramel cake on the nose... super refined, just a suggestion of booze comes with a big snort. Rich bourbon without the heat.
Holy hell... fantastic. It's nice that this is 9.5% because it allows for a smooth bourbon character that isn't accompanied by too much alcohol which sometimes can trick your mind into tasting heat from the bourbon itself. Honey and caramel play key roles. Exceptionally drinkable for a BA imperial stout. 
One of the most unique and delicious beers I've ever had.

4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer poured out as a nice looking semi-thick black beer. The head on top was a dark shade of tan with some lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was full of roasted malts, chocolate notes, bourbon and wooden aromas. The taste of this beer was very good, the flavors of some chocolate and vanilla with the warmth of the bourbon. The sweetness of the honey and the roasted malts balance out nicely along with the bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side but still not as heavy as some imperial stouts. There is a subtle creaminess to the beer also which is really nice. The carbonation is low but has just enough to liven up the brew. Overall it's a killer beer, I've enjoyed each one that I've had from this series... Wishing I could afford more but I'm happy with the three types I picked up. 824 charactersKnapp85, Jul 24, 2012

A - Pours a slightly bubbly tan/khaki colored head that retreats into the blackness of the body.
S - Lots of bourbon. Oak. Some chocolate. Cherries and other dark fruit as it warms up. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering.
T - Flavor is phenomenal and extremely well balanced. Deep, robust and not overly rich. Nice chocolate notes. Mild bourbon and vanilla.
M - Mouth is just under full bodied. Silky with light creamy carbonation. Spot on for how I like in Barrel Aged Stouts.
O - Amazing brew. Can't tell if I like this or the 18 year more. The only knock I have is that I wish the ABV was a little higher but other then that this is an almost flawless Barrel Aged Stout. 713 charactersSkiBum22, Jul 15, 2012

Bottle 559 from 2011
The tan head sits like a coffee milkshake. Deep shiny dark brown, not quite black. A surprising amount of frothy thick lace.
Aroma is thick, sweet chocolate, coconut with a smidge of alcohol/bourbon.
More bourbon in the flavor and some more coconut. A lovely chocolate dark malt flavor. The aftertaste is almost the highlight here. Stays with you and is wonderful. The more I play with this glass, the more I enjoy the bourbon flavors here.
Fairly bold body and quite slick. Slippery and oily, but nice. Rounded edges.
Very good beer. 625 charactersReagan1984, Jul 13, 2012

Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a dark reddish brown with a half finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, wood, sweet alcohol, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, wood, vanilla, caramel, and sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. After having the 18 year old version right before this one it was quite easy to pick out the differences. This one had a caramel note hinting around in it which was nice but not awesome. It did have quite an excellent smell going on with it that was rather inviting. Whether you are trying the 12 or the 18, you really can’t go wrong. 929 charactersthagr81us, Jul 10, 2012

O: The best of the 2011 variants (that I've had so far). The barrel was nicely integrated and melded well with the base beer. 798 charactersTreebs, Jul 08, 2012

2011 Vintage, Elijah Craig 12 year barrel, purple wax
Bottle #3147
Sampled 04JUL12
$30 for the single
[A] One half finger of medium dark brown head, bubbly-foamy, with below average retention. A thick bubbly collar remains for quite a while, with a thin whispy cloud of film grazing the surface. The body is a shade lighter than pitch black with transparency only along the edges when the glass is tilted. Gnarled branches of lace cling to the glass and hold on better than expected.
[S] Earthy yet sweet and spicy bourbon upfront. The honey component is prevalent throughout. A deep layer of caramel mixes with a dusting of cocoa. Buttery French toast. Light alcohol. Mild char, earthy and soily.
[T] Incredibly smooth bourbon and barrel up front. Honey and dark caramelized sugars follow suit. Deftly sweet notes linger long into the finish. Alcohol is extremely well concealed. The sweetness is not overwhelming – but possibly overdone a bit. Additional bitterness and/or roast would have worked well on the palate.
[M] Semi thick and creamy at first with fine, persistently tingling carbonation from mid-palate on. Very sticky throughout. The flavor and aroma are my favorite aspects of the brew.
[O] Of the Eclipses I’ve had thus far, the bourbon character in the Elijah Craig 12 Year seems to be the most refined and well integrated. But the sweetness is a little high, so the long term drinkability is limited for me. 1,454 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Jul 05, 2012

Did it really need more wax??
A-- Pours a dark cola color and settled a dark reddish black color. All sorts of ruby hues with this. Nearly clear when shown to the light. Half finger of light brown head that quickly fades to a thick film that eventually breaks up into a splotchy film. Lots of carbonation bubbles in the head. Nice spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. 
S-- Dark milk chocolate, honey, coconut, toasted marshmallow, and slight oak. Once opened up it shows signs of bourbon and alcohol, yet it mellows again to the original nose. Well balanced and not as sweet as the other variations have been.
T-- A little bourbon forward. Bourbon at first, followed by milk chocolate, carmel, honey, and toasted coconut. Flashes of alcohol but quite restrained. rather smooth really. 
M-- Slick and oily. Alcohol is more obvious in the mouth as there is more heat in the mid and back of the palate. Bit of a milk chocolate, honeycomb, and marshmallow finish to this. There are thin parts to this but the barrel notes do a good job in covering it well. 
O-- Brandy or bourbon? Something that needs to be sipped and savored. Enough notes of the base beer and enough of the barrel to make this really nice. Well done in the balance and in the softer touches of the barrel notes. Not something that hits you over the head with a hammer. 1,387 charactersmulder1010, Jul 05, 2012
4.92/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This review is of the 09' vintage as i did a side by side of this one and the 11' this past weekend
Look: Very dark brown almost black in color with a 1/4 inch tan head and ok retention and when you drink it down it leaves a film on the side of the glass
Smell: The nose is loaded with copious amounts of chocolate, oak, marshmallow, coconut, and bourbon
Taste: The flavor is just as good if not better than the nose. It starts out with a wonder chocolate and coconut flavor and the coconut is just wonderful. The beer then finishes with a nice amount of oak and elijah bourbon. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden where as the 11' the alcohol still shows its face
Mouthfeel: Medium body and mild carbonation with absolutely no alcohol burn which the 11' still had
Overall: The 09' is drinking incredible well at this point and I honestly don't see it getting any better where I believe the 11 could use some time in the bottle but is still great in its own right 970 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jul 03, 2012

2011 Purple Wax
App- So I am really suprised at the black richness of this compared to the 18 year. Much more inky black with a better two finer head with a great line of cling and a swirl on the top.
Smell- This is a great smelling stout. Its a bit of a bourbon, creme, vanilla, chocolate mousse type of thing. No burn at all on the nostrils and just can sit and smell for days. The booze is there on a large pull but its completely hidden within the confines of a small smell.
Taste- I can understand why this one is the best of the bunch. Has a ton of flavor behind it without being cloying or abrasive. The booze is super hidden and the bourbon adds just layers of super creamy flavors. Its a bit oaky and vanilla and a bit of a whip creme like note. Just a wonderful stout. To me its almost a baby BT. Just cut in 1/2.
Mouth- A full medium body with a low medium carbonation. Super creamy with a lush feel to it. Just a smidge too thin. I am just being nitpicky I think. Amazing residual creme, vanilla and oaky booze.
Drink- There is no doubt in my mind why this is so highly rated. I know why I wasnt a fan of the 18. This kicked its ass and now I am kicking my ass for not drinking this sooner and ordering more of it...DAMN!! 1,287 charactersFosterJM, Jun 17, 2012

Wood, coconut, and chocolate syrup were noted in the aromas. Heavy viscous, creamy mouthfeel that becomes a little astringent at the finish. Chocolate syrup forward with some coconut and ample bourbon. A very, very good imperial stout.

A: Pours a thick black with a small tan head on top. Decent retention and minimal lacing. 
S: Wow, a good amount of bourbon going on mixed with some chocolate and a hint of vanilla. The chocolate has both cocoa notes and milk chocolate. There is a little bit of dark fruit, light roast, and oak as well. 
T: A nice follow up from the aroma with a nice combination of chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. There is a little bit more roasty malt and some caramel. The dark fruit on the aroma didn't really show up. 
M: Medium to full bodied, very creamy and smooth. Very easy drinking. 
O: Very impressed. Liked this beer a lot, so easy to drink with a lot of flavor. While hard to differentiate with the 18 year, I did like this one a bit more, but would have no problem drinking either one again. 904 charactersmdaschaf, Jun 04, 2012

Pours an ink black with some tan bubbles around the rim of the glass, no discernable lacing. This is a viscous beer; coats the inside of the glass with a thin oily film when swirled.
On the nose, holy shit. Loads of whiskey and booze. Molasess, butterscotch, raisins, Belgian dark chocolate, oak...extremely rich and robust. Blows the nostrils away.
Molasess, butterscotch, bourbon, dark chocolate, raisins, dry oak, rolled oats, figs....just straight up bourbon barrel goodness. Huge, robust notes with a relentless finish.
Full-bodied, smooth, lush, creamy. Low carbonation, large amounts of ethanol. This guy is big and bad.
Huge, robust stout with heavy bourbon influence. Utterly delicious. 725 charactersColForbinBC, Jun 04, 2012

Looks thin and not as syrupy as some others of its creed. Initially chocolaty with mellow roast and some vanilla; the barrels seem to be only in supporting role at first but the beer opens up with warmth. Creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Would have been more enjoyable had it not been somewhat offputtingly tart.

bottle # 2984 (purple wax)
a - brew poured a watery black that settled into the glass as a deep dark hole with a generous 2 fingers of mocha colored head. the head was gone within minutes leaving some scattered islands of mocha colored bubbles and small splashes of lacing proving that a head was there at one point in time.
s - YUM. BIG chocolate notes with a really nice glazing of bourbon. some vanilla to balance things out. REALLY well balanced.
t - rich and creamy with nice chocolate notes and a smooth bourbon glaze. great roastiness. great wood presence. really and truly a fantastic beer. just as good as the 18 yr.
m - rich and creamy. smooth. easy drinker. great body.
o - overall, the entire series is a hit and this is definitely one of the highlights. really LOVED it...and it totally hit the spot for what i was looking for in a BA Stout tonight.

bottle # BR 3 2012
poured similar to previous years, but the head was more bubbly than i remembered. smell and flavor though, is spot on. nice peatiness and wood in the flavor. these beers...they are pricey, no doubt, but worth it in my opinion (esp if you get in on the futures) the whole series is consistently the top balanced barrel aged beers available. i might even give the taste more of a 4.75 since it is so tasty. 1,626 characterscosmicevan, May 14, 2012

A: Pitch black with no head whatsoever. A touch intimidating. 
S: The smell's pretty incredible, with a rich aroma of bourbon, vanilla, toffee and raisin. Really great smell.
T: The bourbon isn't in the forefront as the smell would suggest, which is actually kind of nice. Instead, it lingered behind notes of chocolate covered raisin and salted caramel with a touch of dryness from the bourbon on the finish. Hints of wood, char and roasted malt. Really complex and very tasty, though I liked the 18 year better. 548 charactersnotchucknorris, May 08, 2012

A bit flat by the time I got to this one, but anyway. I have a FiftyFifty glass somewhere, but a Chimay chalice was handy, so into it I poured this thick, opaque liquid that was dark brown-black, with ruby-brown tints around the edges. The recapped bottle sat in the fridge overnight, but I still got a decent wispy mocha head from an aggressive pour. Nose of bourbon, cherry vanilla ice cream, and rich chocolate. Taste confirmed that this beer was still fine even after being open for hours. Dark roasty malts, big taste of barrel wood, boozy bourbon kick, notes of mingling vanilla and chocolate coming in mid-palate, roasty bitterness in the finish. Any dark fruit notes that may exist are distant and overpowered by the bourbon. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, smooth, full body, some alcohol heat, if there was much carbonation, at least it mellowed out by the time I drank it. Very nice overall. My second bottle will sit for a few years before I open it. 1,105 charactersRifugium, May 08, 2012

bottle numbered 3748 vintage 2011 poured into snifter glass.
reviewed from notes taken on 5/4/12.
Appearance: black bodied beer with 2 finger of dark khaki head. The head stays around for a decent amount of time considering this is a BA stout. Spotty lace on glass.
Smell: mild roast. nice whiskey and oak notes. Hints of vanilla and raisins. 
Taste: This beer is actually less flavorful than I expected. Its whiskey notes seems to be prominent and I only get a little bit of chocolate and vanilla from the stout. But with that said the whiskey notes are quite nice in this stout. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation for a BA Imperial Stout. Smooth and silky. Hides the ABV very well. Could have been a bit thicker too.
Overall: Solid flavors in this beer, just nothing unique in a craft beer scene loaded with BA Imperial Stouts. 909 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, May 07, 2012

Poured from a 22oz bottle into a brandy snifter. Bottle #2531, 2011.
A: Pours a rich black with a nice, lively chocolate-colored head. Retains pretty well and leaves a bit of lacing.
S: Big vanilla, oak, and smooth corny bourbon hits the nose. Raisins, vanilla bean, milk chocolate. Smooth as all hell, not a hint of alcohol.
T: Like the nose, sweet smooth bourbon is fantastically prominent, melding with subtle notes of milk chocolate, bitter cocoa, a bit of roast, some delicious dark fruits. Lots of vanilla and subtle oak character underlies everything. Only the tiniest hint of sweet alcohol.
M: Tiny, pervasive carbonation makes for a velvety mouthfeel. Could be a tiny bit thicker.
O: This is delicious. A bit of a thicker mouthfeel would make this even better. 788 charactersEtan, May 05, 2012

Pours with a nice blackness, and a mocha head, slight but adorns nicely. The aroma is very complex...oak, bourbon, vanilla, toasted nuts, chocolate creme, mild coffee and roasted malts. Balanced wonderfully. On the taste, the bourbon and oak hit you first, but don't overwhelm. Chocolate sweetness and toasted wood, vanilla and roasted malts/coffee balance things out. Full bodied, creamy, chewy and thick. You can't really taste the alcohol, and this is incredibly smooth and drinkable.

The aroma shows some very nice chocolate and bourbon flavors to it, but a good amount of alcohol heat is also there. Some notes of brown sugar and vanilla come out in it as well. Very good overall, but a little too much boozy alcohol to be great.
The bourbon barrel flavors really stand out in the taste. I get some great brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla and oak flavors coming out of it. It works very well with the chocolaty, slightly roasty flavors of the base beer. The bourbon seems to steal the show a little, but it's good enough that I can't really complain. The alcohol that seemed so evident in the aroma is also completely hidden making it very smooth and drinkable. 
The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low. It feels a little heavier than the other Eclipse I've had, which I like. 
Overall, I thought it was a great beer. The bourbon steals the show a little, but it's also adds some pretty awesome flavors. The flavors come together extremely well in it. Great beer overall, I'd definitely put it up there with an elite group of barrel aged beers. 1,247 charactersbillab914, Apr 22, 2012

Appearance: careful pour yields a slightly bubbly tan/khaki colored head that retreats into the blackness of the body.
Smell: oh yeah, this one is definitely bourbon barrel aged.. the bourbon wafts upwards, dominating the aroma.
Taste: again, the Elijah Craig bourbon takes center stage. This beer utilizes the barrel as much as any other beer I've had (perhaps minus Goose Island). I mean, it cuts through the flavor quite dramatically.. possibly overpowering the other components of the stout.
Mouthfeel: not as full bodied as I'd like, but still more than adequate.
Overall: In all honesty, this one exceeded my expectations. I should probably seek out some of the other Eclipse varieties. 870 charactersBlastBeats, Apr 15, 2012

This 2011 EC12 was more raw and bold than any of the others last night. Its stout character came through well, but the bourbon treatment simply wasn't on par with EC18, Buffalo Trace, or '10 HH. A decent stout overall, but a poor value at $25.
Overall, the '11 EC18 was our group's consensus favorite. But honestly, I was unimpressed across the board with most of these beers. Bourbon County Stout is far superior to all of them except EC18.

4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5a lucky and expensive run in. having been extensively in 'bourbon country'... or as one would put it in the american beer realm, the midwest. i think i've had enough of this style. most blend to make something that is intense and a sip at best. and granted. there is a time for this... but i'm going to go with my gut on the fact many breweries find it in there best interest to makes this a coined methodology and a heavy handed way of getting a flavor across. few get it right. 
this bourbon barrel aging is really something though. not a big head at all. light carbonation. but when agitated bubbles keep coming up. nose is a distinct and pungent bourbon oder at first. one that would make you think this is going to be a slow drink. extremely drinkable. and i would all caps that. nice vanilla that is hinted with a velvety feel. a wonderful balance and a bottle that was gone in about a half an hour. 
i recommend at about 50 degrees is best. 949 charactersrtepiak, Mar 02, 2012

Beer is brown on the pour, not much of a head... maybe 1cm. Good staying power, though. Nice oatmeal cookie batter color.
The nose on this is simply fantastic... I am adrift on a sea of bourbon. I already know I am going to like this one. 
The bourbon is here and it's front and center. It's not that hot, though. Really nutty and a lot of toasted oak. Brewed with honey? I don't taste it. Oh well, I'll just have to sit here and enjoy this fantastic bourbon flavor.
I remember reading that the base beer was being beefed up this year. I had EW, not EC last year, but I think I appriciate this one. It's still fairly light in the broader spectrum but it works well with the bourbon. Actually, I'm quite pleased at the body on this.
This beer is great. I'm jazzed to be sitting on the 18/20 yr. bottle... now I just need to find an excuse to open it! 
Thanks, Arbi. I really enjoyed this beer. 943 charactersShogoKawada, Mar 01, 2012

Smells of bourbon, vanilla, and a tad bit of wintergreen mint. Booze is slightly detectable.
Vanilla is more vivid than the bourbon on the palate, with a slight spearmint aftertaste. 
You can tell that it's lighter in body than bourbon county stout, but still has a great feel. 
This beer is not hot at all, one of it's best qualities. Ready to drink now but would do quite well if cellared. 520 characterszep9865, Feb 29, 2012

This beer pours a medium bodied chocolate brown in color wth a light and soapy beige lacing around the glass. The nose is a vanilla and and toffee masterpiece. There is smooth chocolate, smooth vanilla, tofee, cake, and light barrel. Wow, infinitely smooth and refined. This is exceptionally more balanced than the Grand Cru. The bourbon is exceptionally well meshed with the base beer and very approachable even for the style. This beer is ridiculous, and I don't say that often. the bourbon is so well I integrated that comparing it is tough. Wow, overall this is fantastic and I don't like to gush. This is one of the better barrel aged stouts I've had thus far. I will seek this out again. This is a top performance for a highly rated brewery. I applaud this effort. 848 charactersaasher, Feb 29, 2012

2011 Vintage Bottle #2759. $25 for a 22oz bottle.
A: All of them pretty much poured the same. Finger or two of brown to light brown head. The color is black with noticeable bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.
S: The aroma here is very interesting. This was the first variation I delved into, so the aroma hit me big time. Crazy sweet with chocolate, honey, and bourbon taking the cake. Light roast and some vanilla in there as well. Really nicely balanced, too.
T: Compared to some of the others, the taste here isn't that big. Chocolate body with bourbon, honey, and vanilla being the main flavors. Oak, Chocolate, and Boozy finish, the alcohol is tasted throughout the entirety of the beer.
MF: Lighter body overall than I expected, and lower than average carbonation. Big booziness on all of them, with a warming alcohol feeling to finish. The dryness on the palate varies with the different bourbons. This was specifically was lighter in body than the Elijah Craig 18 year.
O: This was good, it just didn't hold up to the other Bourbons. Just not as well balanced. I chose it as the 4th best. 1,269 charactersrusswbeck, Feb 26, 2012

22oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Bottle #2251. Vintage 2011.
(A)- Pours a nice pitch black color. Subtle tan froth and lace.
(S)- A nice bourbon barrel and dry oak bit up front. Some nice caramel, raisin, and more oak. Very subtle cocoa and vanilla. Just a great bourbon character to the nose on this.
(T)- Similar to the smell. Just great bourbon oak characters throughout the taste; both in the background and foreground. Some great raisin, caramel, and cocoa. Just a great barrel notes that blend together well with the stout profile.
(M)- A nice carbonation level and a great balance. The beer makes it very obvious that this is bourbon barrel aged, but its not overly boozy, solvent-like or hot in any way. Extremely well integrated together to create a harmonious barrel aged stout.
(D)- Overall, an excellent stout. A pronounced bourbon barrel profile, but it pulls it off very well into the stout that was put in it. Might be my favorite of the variants. 984 characterssweemzander, Feb 26, 2012

Its pours pitch black, with a deep dark mocha colored head it leaves only a finger width head that dissipates quickly and leaves a ring of lacing. The bourbon is up front but it isn't over powering as other 50/50's I also get some chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and a good oak aroma. The taste is absolutely amazing with most other BA stouts the barrel aging overpowers the other flavors of the stout with this beer the other flavors from the base stout like chocolate, vanilla, and roasted flavor come through and complement the barrel aging. The mouthfeel is good a little viscous but not out of line for the style a little more carbonation could have made this better. Overall this is one of the best aged stouts that I have ever had. 771 charactersphisigben, Feb 14, 2012

From a bomber into a snifter
Vintage: 2009 
Bottle: 986
Wax: Purple 
APPEARANCE: Similar to all the 2010 bottles, but with a bubblier head. Thin, transparent pour yields a small, bubbly looking, tan head with decent retention. Head quickly recedes to a faint wisp and bubbly ring. Black body, quite transparent, with no carbonation evident. A bubbly ring remains until the end leaving no lacing. Just too light and transparent for the style, unfortunately, and the head is just too bubbly on this one. 
SMELL: Huge nose on this one. Perhaps the biggest and boldest nose of the series. Lots of bourbon aromas and plenty of barrel, such as oak, vanilla and milk chocolate. Some nice dark chocolate and licorice notes accompany a hint of roasted notes from the base beer. Lots of barrel and quite impressive. Favorite nose of the series.
TASTE: Big bourbon barrel up front, then a very nice balance between barrel and base beer through the middle into the finish. Bourbon, oak, vanilla and some milk chocolate up front eventually allow room for some dark chocolate and slight roasted notes from the base beer to show through at the swallow. A big and persistent aftertaste of barrel flavors, dark chocolate and licorice linger nicely on the palate. No heat and very, very flavorful stuff. This one probably had the best profile of the series. A bold and enjoyable flavor profile, and the barrel accompanied the base beer very well. 
PALATE: Medium body and lower levels of carbonation. Smooth and silky on the palate, goes down fine and finishes slightly mouth-coating. A little watery perhaps, but very silky and smooth with enough body as well. 
OVERALL: I hate to say it, but believe the hype. Easily my favorite of the ’08 – ’10 series. The look on this one was even more lack-luster than the rest of the series, which is an accomplishment in itself, but the nose and flavor profile were the most impressive, interesting, complex and well balanced of the series. Lots of barrel flavors and a good showing by the base beer lead to a very tasty brew in the end. I look forward to drinking some of the 2011 vintage of this beer, and would love to track down another ’09 as a comparison. Time will tell. This one was worth the hunt. Highly recommended! 2,506 charactersJeffo, Feb 07, 2012

A - Black with one finger of bubbly espresso coloured head. 
S - Bourbon, oak and vanilla up front. Roasted malt and some chocolate aromas in the background. The barrel aging qualities are predominant but don't completely drown out the base beer. 
T - A great mix of bourbon barrel aging characteristics up front - vanilla, bourbon and oak. The base beer also contributes a lot to the palate with roasted malts, coffee, some dark fruit and a hint of licorice. A slight bitterness is present in the finish. The ABV is very well hidden. Remarkable easy drinking for 9.5% ABV.

A vigorous pour gave me a pitch black body topped by a finger and a half of dark tan foam. Most of it dissipates but plenty of chunky bubbles cling around the edge. Only hints of lacing left in glass.
Aroma has an immediate hit of dry dusty barrel. Rich sweet chocolate malt quickly follows. Vanilla and woody oak are big in this one. Also get a nice sting of boozy bourbon.
Wow, bourbon flavor really dominates in this version. Sits on top of the malt through the entire flavor. The expected sweet malt is certainly present though, and supports the bourbon flavor. Semi-sweet dusty bakers chocolate notes. Roasty char is present as well. Finishes with a long lingering whiskey note. Big and boozy, but tasty.
Body is full but carbonation is low, so the overall feel is quite oily slick. Goes down quicker than is good for me.
From a personal preference, this isn't my favorite Eclipse, but it is damn good and really shows off what a bourbon barrel can do to a beer. Got another one of these in the cellar and will let it sit longer than the others given the overall aggressive strength. 1,153 charactersbrotherloco, Feb 05, 2012

A: Black with one finger head that descends into a thin frothy lacing - great carbonation considering the age.
S: Vanilla, bourbon , roasted malt, chocolate.
T: A very smooth and mellow flavorful version of the 12 , The heat had mellowed considerably over the 2011, nothing I can think of that is out of place in this one.

purple wax bottle into Duvel tulip.
Imperial Eclipse Stout, Elijah Craig (12 Year) from FiftyFifty Brewing Co is a black stout with a dark tan bordering on brown cap that left some splotches on the glass.
Smell is what you would expect from the style, dark chocolate with slight vanilla notes and oak toppled by the blend of bourbon BA'ing resulting in bourbon and stout. Some dark fruit pops out. I May have smelled the honey used, but that could be my mind.
This is nice, not as large than I was expecting in body, yet tons of flavor from the barrel without losing the base beer. Nice hits of oak, vanilla, booze, chocolate, cocco, and some roasted malt.
Feel is a little thin for the style. I kind of like that as it makes it easier for me to drink, and Im sure it helps to pick up more of the barrel in a thinner stout. The carb was a bit lacking, yet not dead. Over time, it dwindled.
Great beer, but let's be real, at 30 dollars per bottle it's insanely expensive, a bit insulting actually. In the end it's another big stout with bourbon. 1,099 charactersBARFLYB, Feb 02, 2012

Pours a black that is cola brown at the edges when help up to the light. A small tan head has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is soft oak, some bourbon, marshmallow, vanilla, honey, caramel, some cherry, and some light alcohol. Initial taste has some sweetness with marshmallow, oak, bourbon, and some light roast. Then some hints of plum and cherry. Finish has a light bitterness and leaves a bit of lingering bourbon flavor. Quite smooth overall.

A- Pours black with some very dark red tint towards the top of the glass. A nice caramel color head subsides a bit yet sticks around for awhile. Some nice lacing is seen on the sides of the glass also.
S- Really the strongest smell is the alcohol. Through the alcohol I get hints of chocolate, coffee, malts and maybe some vanilla. The alcohol is very overpowering in the smell though. 
T- Starts out nice and smooth followed by the slight warming from the alcohol. It isn't as hot as I would have thought based on the smell. Also gives a nice roasty taste, accompanied by chocolates, coffee, and dark fruits.
M- Heavy yet smooth. Carbonation amount is perfect. A great sipper. Nice alcohol warming.
This is an awesome beer. Not sure any beer is worth a $30 price tag, but an interesting and rare treat. 901 charactersvic21234, Jan 30, 2012

S - Chocolate, quite a bit of vanilla, some dark fruits, some oak, including a small amount of char, and some noticeable alcohol.
T - Chocolate and vanilla lead the way, with some oak notes and roasted malts. Chocolate is semi-sweet. Dark fruits become noticeable midway through, with some char and bitter chocolate on the finish. Subtle bourbon burn, works very well.
M - Medium mouthfeel with a very nice creaminess. Finish becomes more earthy and bitter.
O - This is the first of of the Eclipse beers I have had, and I was impressed. Not too heavy of a mouthfeel, but still a very nice creaminess. Bourbon is prominent but not in your face, and the fruit notes are nice. 839 characterswarnerry, Jan 29, 2012

A- Pours pretty damn near black, mahogany highlights at the edges when held to light. Capped with a thin creamy tan head that eventually settles to a thin collar. Good lacing.
S- First thing is bourbon, a bit smoky, behind it is some fruit, molasses, and thick roasted malts with coffee and a bit of dark chocolate. 
T- Malt and bourbon flavors are competing from the get go. The first thing I'm tasting is chewy, cake-like roasted malts with a lot of chocolate and a bit of coffee, wrestling with a smoky bourbon with vanilla and oak. The bourbon on this beer is perfect, it provides just a bit of alcohol burn towards the finish but doesn't overpower the other flavors, it's really spot-on. Underneath this there's a fruity layer, with raisins, figs and dates. 
M- Full-bodied, thick and chewy, smooth feel, carbonation is on the lower side but is perfect for this beer. Alcohol isn't intrusive on the flavor and provides a nice warmth as you drink.
O- I can't remember the last time I had an Imperial Stout like this, take this as a benchmark of what the style should be and how to barrel age a beer. Totally delicious. 1,196 charactersWillCarrera, Jan 25, 2012

A - Pours jet black with a nice one finger tall off-white head leaving light lace down the glass.
S - Smells of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and oak. The alcohol is fairly prevalent initially but it mellows out and some of the other aromas come out. It will be interesting to see how this develops in the bottle.
T - Starts off with a quick jolt of vanilla and chocolatey sweetness that quickly gets enveloped by the warming bourbon. Once the booze dies down it leave the pallet dry with oak tannins, lingering on the pallet for some time. This one is a joy to drink, altho I think it may even get better in the bottle.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderately low carbonation. Smooth, silky feel that clings to the pallet. Alcohol is present but doesn't really get in the way.
O - One of the best Eclipses' I have had to date. The balance of base to barrel was nearly flawless and the booze never got to the point of being overpowering. Glad I finally got to try this one as it really lived up to my expectations. 1,155 charactersorangesol, Jan 25, 2012

S: Fresh bourbon, roasted cocoa, coffee and roasted malts.
T: Well, the taste completely makes up for any thing lacking in the appearance. The flavors are extremely well rounded Elijah Craig bourbon notes with American oak barrel and sweet malt flavors. There is a great amount of depth of flavor in here for a 9.5 Imperial stout. There is close to no booze presence and extremely well rounded overall. 
M: Light mouthfeel for a stout. Light carbonation which is right for the style. 
O: Very impressed with my first 50/50 Eclipse stout. The subtle nuances of the bourbon barrel are really felt and enjoyable. I do not think I have had a bourbon barrel aged stout that had quite this much bourbon flavor without being boozy and I could definitely appreciate this again. 956 charactersalpinebryant, Jan 25, 2012

Poured at cellar-to-room temp into snifter. Short tan head over a deep brown cola body (when held to the light). Spotty lacing. 
Aromas are full of deep red wine, with some dark chocolate, and oak barrel. Pretty sure that if you didn't look at this, you'd swear it was a wine. 
Amazingly smooth on the palate. Flavors are much sweeter than the nose, with dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, wood, floral hops, and then mocha in the finish. The bourbon really only comes through in the "glow" / aromas that accompany the swallow. Freaking creamy and smooth for a BBA Impy Stout...only a hint of carbonation. But zero harsh. 
Honestly, if this were on draft I'd have to be cut off for the first time in my life. This is a remarkably smooth and tasty beer. 778 charactersBeerImmediately, Jan 22, 2012

T. Tastes of chocolate, port wine flavors coming through and some mild and well blended whiskey.
M. Medium-heavy body, tingle and a wine-style dryness, with high carbonation.

Charred oak, sweet bourbon, chocolate with a notable alcohol burn in the finish. Definitely didn't get much burn once it warmed up to room temperature. I really like the bourbon presence in the beer. Yeah, it tastes somewhat like a half shot of bourbon dumped into a good chocolate stout but slightly more complex. But I really like it!

3.51/5  rDev -20.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Poured into a snifter. 2011 vintage, bottle #3609. Purple wax, so I have the right listing.
4.5 A: Black color. Two fingers of creamy tan head. Retention is good and glass covering lacing is left behind.
3.5 S: Compared to the BT blend, this is surprisingly mellow. There's less of everything. Less chocolate from the base beer, less bourbon, less intensity overall. Like the BT, the barrel aging is very good. No hints of astringency or off-flavors. Also, the booze is incredibly well hidden. The bourbon itself is leathery, lightly earthy, and superbly smooth. Less vanilla and oak in this one. Overall this is about as well put together as it can get, but it's lacking any sort of intensity or complexity.
3.5 T: The taste follows the nose in that this is super mellow, but not as impressive as it could be. There isn't much going on from the base beer except for a light chocolate and roastiness. Rather, this is just a showcase for the bourbon. Unfortunately, the bourbon isn't strong enough for this to be much of a success. Leathery with melon fruitiness, a light earthiness, and a mild booze. A lot more well rounded that the BT blend, but also not as potent. Thus, it ends up with the same score.
3.0 M: Medium body. Maybe a touch heavier than the BT blend. This could use a touch more carbonation, but it's within the acceptable range. Also lacking with creaminess.
3.5 D: This beer (and I assume the rest of what I'll drink) suffers from the same problems as the previous variants I've had. Great barrel aging, but they started with a less than impressive stout. Put a little more effort in there, and this would be a gangbusters horizontal. As an aside, EC must be some good stuff since it came off so mellow, well rounded, and complete in this beer. I might have to pick up a bottle. 1,801 charactersDavoleBomb, Jan 21, 2012

Big thanks to my boy Ryan for sharing this bottle with me!
Bottle #2508. My second Eclipse variant, and hopefully not my last. It pours a straight obsidian topped by a small bit of dark tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, chocolate powder, roasted malts, bourbon, vanilla bean, oak, and molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, though with a touch more vanilla, a good amount of bourbon, and a tiny touch of char in the background. The body is a lithe medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a pretty damn smooth feel. Overall, a very nice stout, one that suffers only from its relative thinness (though this doesn't hold it back too much, if you ask me). Good times. 731 charactersTMoney2591, Jan 20, 2012

a - Pours a pitch black color with two inches of a medium tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks like an awesome, thick RIS. 4.5
s - Smells of bourbon, oak, roasted malts, rich milk chocolate, bakers chocolate, burnt malts, and toasted malts. A very nice nose. Whiskey is up front, but it isn't overly strong, and there is a ton of roasted notes and chocolate. 4
t - Tastes of bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malts, sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, toasted malts, and light caramel malts. More whiskey here, and some nice vanilla. Awesome taste, better than the nose. Think I know what beer this is. 4.5
m - Medium to full body and low to moderate carbonation. Thick and creamy, a great mouthfeel for a big stout. 4.5
o - Overall I thought this was an awesome RIS. Looks great and has a great taste and mouthfeel. Ton of bourbon and vanilla in the taste; a fantastic stout. I figured this was the 12 year Elijah Craig Eclipse based on the wax and was sure of it once I tasted it; definitely lived up to it for me and a huge Want.
And the reveal is Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year). Awesome, awesome beer, thanks Kyle! 1,273 charactersmdfb79, Jan 18, 2012
4.29/5  rDev -3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle 128 of the 2011 release
Appearance: Pours a pitch black color with a very modest head that leaves a trail of dots behind
Smell: Roasty and slightly smoky, with chocolate fudge, bourbon and vanilla elements
Taste: Chocolate fudge, up front, with the roasty/smoky elements building into a full Bourbon character by mid-palate; after the swallow, the vanilla builds to smooth out some of the harshness of the beer's relative youth though the finish still has some rough edges
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with low to moderate carbonation; slightly creamy but also slightly thin; warmth in the gullet from the abv
Overall: A very nicely balanced bourbon-barrel aged IS; other than the appearance and slightly thin mouthfeel, this is really a top drawer example of the style 783 charactersbrentk56, Jan 17, 2012

What a beautiful bourbon smell. Tons of vanilla and oak. There's coffee, soy, cocoa, and even a little artificial grape smell hiding in there. 
Big, robust favors pop all over. The bourbon takes over, but remains smooth. The vanilla really softens it from being boozy. It is hot, but intentionally. The taste even adds a dimension of raisins and dates. 
Mouthfeel is smooth and low carbonation. It could use a little more body, but I'm really stretching to find any flaw.
This is a great beer. It's pricey, but I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. 679 charactersVonerichs, Jan 12, 2012

S: Wow, this smells like I am about to drink a glass of Bourbon. There are some roasted malt and alcohol on the nose, but really the bourbon smell is way too over-powering. 
T: At first its just like a glass of bourbon.... but then the beer lingers and lingers and lingers. After the beer moves past the bourbon, it starts to get a nice vanilla taste to it... Then after that I get some roasted malt and then after that, I start to get a sweet caramel. It is such an amazing taste.
M: For as strong and as much alcohol as this beer has, it is beyond smooth. It has hardly any burn to it and leaves a slight dry feeling in my mouth. A perfect mouthfeel for this style of beer.
O: I was very shocked at how awesome this is. The smell really turned me off at first, but once you drink it and then smell it, it compliments the beer. This for sure belongs in the top 100 beers. 1,095 charactersgtermi, Jan 09, 2012

Served in a 6 oz snifter.
I previously had the 18 year Elijah Craig at Bluepalms as well, so I hope I can have as close to a vertical tasting comparison as possible. I probably should have had both the 18 year and 12 year, but I couldn't resist the Abyss. Enough yapping..
A: Dark as night, with subtle lacing and tiny carbonation presence. Similar to the 18 year in these traits. 
S: Bourbon all the way through. Not as much of a french vanilla presence in this as the 18 yr. Maybe the older cognac barrels add more complex notes in the nose. This has a much more alcohol presence in the smell. Some cocoa hints at the end.
T: Like a fine cognac. Buttery notes at the front of the tongue, but they quickly disappear and the bourbon notes take over. Charred wood bark and hints of toffee at the end are very subtle. More boozy than the 18 year old blend in my opinion. 
M: Silky mouthfeel. Similar to the 18 year old blend.
O: I must say that i liked the 18 year blend a little better due to the added sweet notes from the older barrels. This 12 year blend is no slouch though. Sipping on this on a cold night is what the doctor ordered. This blend reminds you that it's a 10-11% beer that must be RESPECTED for full enjoyment. A treat.

4.01/5  rDev -9.5%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Bottle #2898 of 2011's batch. Purple wax.
A: Bottle poured into a large snifter. The head is/was tan, gone in seconds to just a ring of tight bubbles around the glass. Swirling leaves some lacing that falls quickly back into the beer. Wouldn't say pitch black here, some dark brown is noticeable when held up to light. Not really impressive looking.
S: The whiffs of this I was getting while checking out the appearance of the beer were stunning...and I'm about 3 feet away from it. Spicy and strong, smoky and woody. Sweet notes of vanilla and molasses. A bit of rye. Plenty going on here, and the base beer holds up well with all this on top of it. If you really get your nose in there it gets a bit boozy, but all the overriding sweet tones cancel this out very well. Quite nice.
T: Incredibly smooth, no alcohol burn whatsoever which I've encountered in other bourbon barrel stouts. All of the sweet notes of the bourbon come out, complimented by deep chocolate and coffee flavors. The wood adds nice tobacco and leafy characteristics. Only complaint is that it seems the base beer itself doesn't really stand out enough.
M: A bit thin for a big stout, carbonation is low. Finishes a bit strong and lasting on the back of the tongue and throat, but not much lingers otherwise. 
O: Well balanced flavors and great contribution from the barrel. Found the beer thin for the style, but it is really covered by amazing compound flavors. 1,440 characterskiddynamite920, Jan 04, 2012

Beer poured into over-sized snifter with no head whatsoever. Smell is primarily a very pleasant bourbon smell though it sort of hits the back of my nostrils making me pull back if I whiff too strongly.
The taste is unlike most bourbon barrel beers I've had. The bourbon is almost a footnote with the flavor of the beer taking center stage. Definitely more complex flavor bourbon stouts, slight hint of smoke, vanilla and oak. This goes down smooth. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 in flavor is a weird aftertaste that I can leave with but would appreciate more if it wasn't there. 
Mouthfeel is a bit light, but not by too much to detract me from loving this beer. 
This is a tremendous brew, incredible in a lot of ways. I appreciate the way the bourbon lays in the background and the beer shines through. The complexity of flavor here is impressive. Can't wait to try the other variations. 940 charactersBlanco, Dec 29, 2011

Appearance: Pours black with a 1 finger khaki crown that shows little retention and moderate lace.
Smell: Bourbon, rich caramel, some roast, a dash of soy sauce, a pinch of stale hops, and a whisper of oxidation.
Taste: Same as the nose with a fairly strong alcohol note and warmth. This is a fairly beautiful barleywine like stout in the sense that it really has a nice caramel malt profile despite the roast quality and dark color. Intriguing. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied (a touch thin for my liking for this style) with medium carbonation.
Drinkability: Goes down well despite the big bold flavors. The mouthfeel makes it more drinkable although slightly less enjoyable. 762 characterskoopa, Dec 24, 2011

4.54/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Significantly better than the four roses version.
Pours black with a dark brown border. All of these beers surprise me with their aggressive bubbling/head and lighter than expected consistency.
Smells like delicious vanilla laced bourbon, just a bit of dark chocolate, much stronger sweet milk chocolate, and more bourbon. Surprising notes of wood, smoke, and leather. Smells great. 
Taste is wonderfully complex, with balancing dark roasted malts that provide just a slight dash of bittering espresso with a big heaping of bourbon, alcohol laced vanilla, and a surprisingly rich and deep lingering aftertaste of smoked bourbon laced leathery sun dried plums. Only off-note is a kind of strange burnt raisin acridness ... not sure what that is, but barely noticeable.
Just a fine, wondrous beer with rich, perfectly blended flavors that does not try to do too much. I'm starting to think brewers are just going overboard with putting too much random shit into beers. It's nice to see someone take a straightforward recipe, age it the perfect length of time, and produce something truly remarkable.
*like all the beers in this series, could use a touch more body.

2011 vintage.
Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that fades to an oily film. Thin streaks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, wood, and a strong bourbon aroma. Taste is pretty much the same. The bourbon from the 12 year Elijah Craig is very nice and still packs a punch. There is a slight roasty bitterness and a somewhat strong alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barrel aged stout with a more in your face bourbon presence versus the 18 year Elijah Craig version. On of my favorites for the night. 788 charactersUCLABrewN84, Dec 18, 2011

This was taster number 2. The appearance is nothing special, dark black, no head to speak of, but looks a bit syrupy. The smell really jumps out at you. It smells very sweet, boozy, bourbon and vanilla. The smell is great but it did make me a bit concerned that the beer would be oversweet. Not a problem though. The beer is sweet, but not overly so, and a lot of the booze in the nose is gone in the taste. Vanilla, coffee, bourbon and chocolate dominate the flavor. Very little roastyness, which I really like in a stout. The feel is outstanding. Low carbonation, and very smooth and syrupy. Coats the mouth and the flavor lasts. Finish lingers but is not dry. Although it's a sipper, the glass was gone before I even realized it. And the alcohol is surprisingly low considering the flavor...this is practically sessionable as imperial stouts go. Really really good stuff, by far the best of the four Eclipses I had last night. 1,000 charactersrxdrewthejew, Dec 18, 2011

Poured a dark black with a thin khaki-colored haze and slight ring. Big, sweet aromas of dark roasted malt, brownie batter, and caramel, vanilla, and oak from the Bourbon barrels. Taste is similar to the nose, tons of dark chocolate, malt, and high-quality Bourbon character. Incredibly smooth and drinkable, the Bourbon has none of that "fiery" quality and is so nicely integrated into the beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium mouthfeel (a bit thinner then I hoped/expected) and lowish carbonation. Overall an amazing barrel-aged Stout, glad to be able to crack it with good friends! 611 charactersjsanford, Dec 12, 2011

Pour: Pitch black with a dark espresso head and moderate carbonation.

Taste: Pretty similar to the nose, the bourbon is so well integrated that it blew my mind. People liked this better than the PvW version.

4.61/5  rDev +4.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5Bottle 766 from 2009 release shared and poured into a snifter glass. Beer pours a very dark brown, bordering on black, with some lighter browns at the edges of the glass when held up to the light. No head formation at all, but a bit of alcohol feet after swirling. Not much carbonation visible either. 
The bottle was stored cold but even poured cooler than is ideal, the aroma is very nice and strong. Big bourbon influences with vanilla, toasted oak and coconut, dark chocolate, medium roasted fruity coffee, dried dark fruits like prunes and cherry. As it warmed a little, a little more sweetness comes through, dark caramel bordering on burnt sugar, toffee, and molasses. 
Taste doesn't disappoint, more of the dark fruit flavor comes through initially with some prune, raisin and cherry upfront, then a good amount of dark chocolate and coffee flavors. As the beer sits on your tongue and warms, the vanilla, toasted and charred oak comes through, roasted malt. Finish is long, with toasted coconut, vanilla and dark chocolate sticking around on your tongue for a long time. Very complex and balanced flavor. 
Barely medium body with minimal carbonation, a thinner body that I would expect from a fairly big beer. The alcohol is very well hidden, no heat in the taste or in the back of the throat. Balanced and smooth beer, fantastic aromas and flavor. Well worth the cost of the bottle. 1,395 charactersnataku00, Dec 04, 2011

4.29/5  rDev -3.2%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Mike/Mihir for sending this my way.Poured into a Founders snifter at around 60 degrees. 2009 bottle.
A - Pours fairly black. Light head turns quickly into lacing. Sticks surprisingly well to the side of the glass. The bubbles that appear solely due to the pour ending in the middle of the glass are considered in the score here, as they don't make it look better. Looked the same on both pours.
S - I could smell it with the hiss of the cap. Sweet, smooth bourbon. Not as potent as I'd initially thought from the opening of the bottle. Slightest hints of toffee and chocolate.
T - Smooth, fairly balanced amount of a caramel/toffee, dark malts, slight sweetness and then a nice charred oak finish. Quite enjoyable. I find some dark fruits throughout as well. There is a little bit of hotness still going on, but nothing to deter me at all. The balance that the taste provides, while still being complex, is by far my favorite thing about this beer.
M - Moderate thickness and silky. Has almost a bit of flatness to it though and I find that a little bit off-putting. The mouthfeel grew on me as ounces disappeared. It is like carbonation was sacrificed for a better feeling of thickness. I guess I actually like that. 
O - Pretty good one here. It lacks here and there, but I could drink this all day. Due to the carbonation and current balance, I really don't see this getting much better. That won't stop me from waiting another year to open my next bottle. 1,474 charactersclaaark13, Nov 16, 2011

4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A big thanks to waltonc for this great beer. Shared with fellow BA’s at the CBS release. Taken from notes. Bottle #1142, 2009 version.
Appearance – Pours as one would expect a vicious black into a tulip. About a half finger of dark chocolate head is achieved with a sloppy pour which dissipates somewhat quickly leaving slight brown lacing.
Smell – A luscious chocolaty vanilla aroma up front. The bourbon is there ever so slightly, though through the entire sniff. Oak, char, roasted malts, sweet fruits.
Taste – As with the nose, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, and oak. The smooth Pappy comes in midway and refuses to be told what to do, and thus stays till the end of the sip. A wonderful char and roasted malt character toward the finish, and ends with a slight dryness. As the beer warms more dark fruits can be tasted, though they are not the focal point whatsoever. So smooth.
Mouthfeel – Thick, though not enough to take away from the beer. Lower carbonation; creamy.
Overall – I really wish I could have had this side by side with the Pappy version I had at Zwanze day. A fantastic beer, and right up there with the Pappy. Sadly, I feel this may be right there WITH the Pappy but I was so damn cold from standing outside for CBS that I did not get to properly enjoy this as I was able to with the Pappy. I would love to try this version again. 1,370 charactersSpdKilz, Nov 06, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours completely black, letting almost no light through at all. A small mocha-colored head sits atop, and slowly recedes, leaving minimal lacing left behind. 
S: Dark chocolate and bourbon dominate, with subtler vanilla, toffee, and roasted barley. Just a slight hint of oak in the background too. 
T: Lots of chocolate (almost fudgy) up front with roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and oak all crammed in one sip, yet subtle in comparison. This really has a lot going on, yet the transition and balance are very impressive. Booze is almost completely hidden, with JUST a touch of heat in the throat. Finishes slightly sweet and with delicious lingering barrel characteristics. 
M: Nice viscosity, yet smooth and slightly chewy. Lightly carbonated, but still provides a tingle on the tongue. Almost no heat at all, and only a tad drying at the finish. Very well done in my opinion. 
D: This one went down almost too easy. Alcohol hidden well, extremely tasty, well balanced, and nice mouthfeel made it a stout to remember. I'd love to get my hands on another bottle of this, for sure. 1,098 charactersMississipping, Jul 26, 2011

A: pours a dark chocolate color with a thin mocha colored layer of foam. No retention and almost no lacing
S: amazing. Cocoa, vanilla, honey, molasses, and booze. Can make out the oak too
T: almost but not quite as amazing as the nose. All of the above flavors are present, though slightly muted 
M: velvety and smooth. Chocolate flavor lingers nicely
O: an awesome brew. I need to try the other versions 531 charactersroodie, Jul 25, 2011

From notes
A - Dark body, hint of red light in the edges, small ring of tan head

The nose on this is incredible. Tastes of dark chocolate and vanilla. Overall the flavour is really solid but there is a harsh booziness that hits a bit hard. I like the beer quite a bit but it feels hotter than it should. 339 charactersUrbancaver, Jul 01, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle graciously shared by Dyan last month in DC, very appreciative for the chance to try this. One of these days I'm gonna set up a tasting with a bunch of FiftyFifty Eclipse beers side-by-side, it would be cool to check out the differences from the barrels. By itself this one seemed kind of special to me, my second favorite to PVW. 
It pours dark brown with a tan foam, same as the other Eclipse beers I suppose. The nose is very nice, big hits of Elijah Craig along with the sweet malty aromas of the base beer. Some cocoa and oak, but mainly the bourbon.
It tasted really good, large barrel character along with cocoa and dark fruits. Viscous and sticky feeling, the flavors lasted long after my glass was empty. Excellent, I'd be very happy to try this one again any time. I owe you Dyan. 798 charactersTurdFurgison, Jun 21, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Healthy pour from a 22oz bottle with purple wax into my snifter at our awesome pre-Dark Lord Day tasting. Not sure who brought this out, but it made a wonderful addition to a star-studded night (and there were good beers there too!).
Guess what? This American Double/Imperial Stout is black. Surprised? You shouldn't be - 50/50 does a good job with the base beer here, and this version hasn't lost any of the solid black color. Thick, oily and viscous looking, the beer lacks any real head except for an initial brown cap, and there's no lace. Still an appealing looking beer.
The smell is the first real indication that this will be a treat to remember. There's a luscious vanilla and cocoa powder thing going on that just draws me in. The roast isn't heavy, but gives nice chocolate and coffee notes with just a touch of sweet caramel underneath. The barrel really shines here, and the resulting bourbon, oak and vanilla notes are really smooth, expressive and alluring.
This beer tastes fantastic. If it wasn't for my experience with some of the top, top, top tier bourbon aged stouts, I'd say this was perfect. That's not a put-down - this beer is damn close to liquidized idealism. Things start off with great roasted malts - there's a nice chocolate note reminiscent of fudge and some touches of toffee, molasses and sugary bread dough. The barrel aging really shines - there's tons of bourbon and oak, lending some great booze and vanilla. I'd have to say this is extreme and balanced at the same time - the mastery in barrel aged artistry is on display. Some dry bourbon in the finish with a touch of lingering vanilla and sweet malt. Amazing!
The mouthfeel is medium plus body with low, creamy carb. The beer is never syrupy and dances along on it's journey to my belly. The booze is well concealed except for the bourbon which totally makes this the winner it is. Overall, this beer kicks total ass. Something I'm permanantly ISO. Nice one, fidy fidy! 1,965 charactersjampics2, May 25, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle shared by dyan recently. Thanks! Working my way down the top 100, very slowly for the last 10 or so.
Beer is black / dark brown, appears thick. Thin head, diffuse, breaks, pulls toward the glass. No lacing.
Aroma is sweet and big, mild barrel flavor, mild bourbon, very sweet, molasses, darkness.
Beer is medium to thick in body. Sweet at the lead off, the midpalate is molasses and bourbon, not hot, heavy finish, thick overall. Decent beer, very good. I'd have it again, looking forward to this year's Elijah Craig bottles. 535 charactersdrabmuh, May 16, 2011
4.43/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black with a tan head. Looks the part. The smell is nothing too exciting - small hints of the barrel combine with that honey sweetness and cocoa / chocolate. The taste of this beer, however, is a huge winner. Honey, cocoa, chocolate, fudge, roast, bourbon, vanilla, oak, char all combine seemlessly to provide a decadent and yet somehow light and easy drinking (for the style), perfectly balanced barrel aged imperial stout. Once again, the base beer is a ridiculous palette to paint barrel aging on and this is the best one that I have had to date (have not had PvW yet). Mouthfeel is very good - reasonable carbonation and a good body, especially considering the low ABV. This is just fantastic and worth seeking out. The only ding for me is a less than spectacular nose. 779 charactersseeswo, May 15, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sampled this at Creekside Brewing Company during a central coast BA gathering last night. bulletrain76 shared this one. Thanks Sam!
Poured into a 4oz. tasting glass.
Appearance: Black body with brown edges. A tight, filmy head sits atop for the duration of the tasting. Nice lacing. I wish it was a bit darker, but no real complaints here.
Smell: Sweet caramel and floral bourbon, dark chocolate, and cocoa powder. No fusel notes; alcohol is hidden very well. Smooth and pleasant, but not that complex.
Taste: Dark chocolate, chocolate syrup, caramel, booze, and vanilla. Very little hop character. Rich and very smooth, with gentle sweetness and warmth in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Full, a touch syrupy, warm, semi-dry, and lightly carbonated. Very smooth for a bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout.
Overall: Hits all the marks you're looking for in a barrel-aged imperial stout. Smooth and complex without being too dry or hot. Delicious! 941 charactersThreeWiseMen, May 15, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Alex for generously sharing fifty million things, including this.
A - It pours a shiny brown-black, and is capped with a thin layer of khaki froth, eaving spotty lacing upon the glass.
S - The nose is subtle and sublime; notes of chocolate, sweet buttercream, vanilla-oak and dark fruit make for a smooth and understated nose. Heavy roast, coffee, char, brutality; none of it is apparent in the nose.
T - The taste is so smooth, that I actually think it is crosses the line into being too smooth; it has no edginess to speak of. There are delicate nuances of milk chocolate, vanilla fudge, buttery oak, and hazelnut; whisky barrel character is quite subdued, I'd honestly prefer to see more of it. As it airs out, the booze is slightly more apparent, but still, this Elijah Craig stuff is just too damn smooth.
M - The feel is very nice; as silky as I recall a brew being.
O - This beer, though quite nice, is over-hyped. It is not mind-blowing, it is just very very good. The barrel is too subdued, and the base beer is not dynamic enough to push it to the highest level. 1,091 charactersktrillionaire, May 13, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Vintage 2009.
A-Pitch black with a thin, coffee colored head. No lacing.
S-Bourbon oak, vanilla, espresso bean, raspberry, bittersweet chocolate.
T/M-Just gorgeous. Thin on the tongue, but lush and silky on the back of the throat. Strong coffee bean/bourbon flavors, complemented by a touch of vanilla and honey. There is an off flavor of charred wood/chalkiness that gets distracting after awhile. Full bodied with low carbonation.
O-A great beer, but WAY too expensive. Loses some points for the ludicrous price. 518 charactersDaveHS, May 07, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Nanoslug for sending me this a while back. Finally got around to opening it - shared at the WLV/de Struise event. Served in a wine glass.
A - Late-rising half-finger of tan foam that settles to a wispy partial cap, leaving behind spotty lace. Near-black body that is raisin brown at the fringes.
S - Big raisin and dark fruits, milk chocolate, fudge, and vanilla. It's on the sweet side of things, with only light roast and oak character.
T - Taste is heavier in oak, with some elements of cocoa and anise bitterness in the finish. Seems a bit empty mid-palate, although it improves substantially as it warms up. It's closer to a 4.0 when it starts, but gets closer to 4.5 by the time I was wrapping up my pour.
M - Smooth, sticky, and chewy body. Plenty sufficient in heft for the listed 9.5%, although I think that's actually for the base beer. No obvious alcohol warmth.
D - This is very good, but I can't get past the nagging feeling that it was probably better about six months ago. A very enjoyable barrel-aged stout that isn't quite up to the level of the top percentile. Still - highly recommended. 1,121 charactersMasterSki, May 05, 2011

A: Deep black brown body with just a thin khaki head.
S: Assertive, but refined bourbon notes of vanilla, oak and booze.
T: Like the nose this had assertive, but balance and refined bourbon. As a result you really could explore the bourbon notes that augmented the solid malty base of caramel, roast, and a little chocolate.
M: Nice carbonation provides a little tingle on the tongue when combined with just a smidgen of bourbon heat.
O: A very nice bourbon barrel stout that hangs with all the big boys. It was a toss up for me between this and PPW for best of show. The other tasters put this a clear consensus #2. 689 characterscallmemickey, Apr 30, 2011

WOW, A Perfect Barrel Aged Beer? Maybe not perfect, but this is DAMN CLOSE.
Tons of chocolate with hints of bourbon all though the taste. The mouth feel is fantastic, even with little-to-no carbonation. I would like just a hint of more body, but honestly this is one of the best barrel aged beers I have ever had.

Smooth integrated bourbon is first noticeable in the aroma. Glazed raisins, big vanilla wafting into the air. Slightly stronger alcohol smell next to the '09 JD and HH.
Taste is a chocolate fudge bomb with a beautiful bourbon aftertaste. Sharp notes of charred oak and vanilla. A real easy drinking BA stout. It's just so smooth and chocolatey. 384 charactersBearsOnAcid, Apr 15, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Oil slick black, minimal head on most of the Eclipse beers. Aroma was heavy on the bourbon, as to be expected. Played up the vanilla more than any of the other Eclipses I can recall. 
Taste, again, wood, bourbon, vanilla. Dwarves the totality base stout in here. Good charred qualities. Not super viscous, went for subtlety vs. trying to make the biggest stout in the world. 
Low carbonation allows the quaint amount of chocolate to come out as it warms. Warming. Had on tap at the 1st annual pre release party Dec. 1, 2010. Chewy, without being over the top in any one area, everything played real nice with each other. Possibly my favorite bourbon version of Eclipse.
EDIT: Damn, the 2011 version was pretty damn nice too. 727 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Apr 09, 2011

Black pour, thin tan head. Aroma is of roasted malts, burnt wood, caramel/chocolate sweetness. Flavor follows the nose. Very well balanced whiskey barrel stout. Bitter-sweet chocolate, vanilla, wood, roasted malts, grain. Some fruity/apple characteristics as well. Big chewy, well carbonated mouthfeel. Excellent brew. 412 charactersmuttyd, Apr 04, 2011

4.69/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I drank this originally from a tasting glass at NotB then re-reviewed and scored off a bottle from Nate on 3/20/2011... The beer pours a super dark black, hardly any head though. Poor lacing... The aroma is great, chocolate brownies, vanilla, bourbon finish. Not decadent or overstated, very restrained. Outstanding... The taste is superbly balanced, tastes great, and easily crushable. Fudge brownies, vanilla, light bourbon, a nice warm alcohol sensation in the middle, and the finish has some nice roasted coffee notes. The full spectrum is displayed and perfectly integrated. I had the PVW last weekend I think I almost prefer this, would love to do a side-by-side comparison. 
I originally rated this a 4.6, this time its deservedly higher. 746 charactersjrallen34, Mar 20, 2011

S - Great smelling of chocolate and bourbon with vanilla notes. Nice and roasted with just the right amount of wood.
T - A lot like a chocolate brownie with great bourbon notes and barel wood. The vanilla is present along with roast and slightly charred malts. Tiny bit of molasses and dark fruit.

4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Purple wax 22 oz bottle, sampled with the 09 and 10 HH with Jeff and Adam.
Pours a viscous near black, opaque and foreboding with a quickly fading tan head and no lacing. 
Aroma is rich and sweet, thick with bourbon, vanilla, oak, char, roast and smoke. A little too mild to be a 5, but perfectly balanced. As with all the Eclipses, balance between the beer and barrel is superb, with the EC bourbon dominating the flavor, a little more vanilla than the chocolate that dominated the EW and a more prominent oak and roast finish than the others. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with subtle carbonation. Overall effect is like other Eclipses, a little thin compared to other beers of this style, but not detrimentally so.
As this warms the finish and oak separate this from the HH and make this beer a little more interesting in my opinion. Extremely smooth and balanced, it's a tossup which Eclipse I prefer. 910 charactersyourefragile, Mar 03, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pitch black with minimal head, which is to be expected, but a swirl reveals some excellent legs.
Aroma is sweet vanilla and oak with hints of dark fruits and some bits of smoke. As it warms the smoke becomes more prevalent. I'm no bourbon expert, but it really reminds me of the Elijah Craig 12-yr I have in the bar.
Taste has lots of the dark fruits that become less noriceable as it warms. Oak is most apparent in the finish with some bits of vanilla and bourbon in the middle.
Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth with mild carbonation. It's a little thinner than expected but it works well. This one goes down smooth and easy, definitely one of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. 690 characters321jeff, Feb 24, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tasting glass.
Appearance: This pours a dark brown with walnut edges. A small brown head forms initially but fades rather quickly and leaves no lace. 
Smell: The delicious aroma of Elijah Craig hits me first, with molasses, vanilla, and oak coming next. Chocolate and a bit of coffee add to the wonderful aroma.
Taste: The EC takes a minute to really hit my taste buds. Dark roasted malt blends well with a decadent dark chocolate and a bit of coffee flavor. Then a vanilla and molasses sweetness introduce the bourbon flavor. A bit of woody oak, a touch of smoke, and then the finish is lightly sweet and more bourbon. Delicious.
Mouthfeel: This is full bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. Somewhat creamy, but also a bit dry. Bourbon has the typical warming effect.
Drinkability: Getting to try this was a treat. The beer performed as well, meeting my expectations. Another success for barrel aged stouts. 960 charactersKickInTheChalice, Feb 23, 2011

A: The pour is viscous and black with a finger of tan colored head forming.
S: Smells like bourbon--delicious, delicious, bourbon. Lots of vanilla and chocolate making the nose a thing of decadence. Smooth roasted malts along with a nice oak aroma. Some toffee and caramel provide additional sweetness.
T: Intense vanilla, bourbon, and chocolate on the tongue provides an excellent drinking experience. Great roasted malts along with a really creamy caramel flavor.
M: The body is medium to full and is silky on the tongue. The carbonation is there but stays out of the way, providing a really smooth mouthfeel.
D: As much as I don't want to hype these beers up, they are just so damn good. Probably my favorite series of imperial stouts. I will definitely be doing my utmost to go to the next release party. 934 characterswomencantsail, Jan 13, 2011

Huge thanks to Jeff (ipa247) for this one. 2009 vintage. Poured from a 22oz. bottle (#175) into a Darkness snifter. 
A: Gentle pour yields a slowly forming .5 finger light mocha head with poor retention. Beer is opaque black with the slightest hint of light peaking through at the top. Lacing is stringy with decent stick. 
S: Nose is subtle. Bourbon, sweet soy sauce, dark chocolate, and liquified prunes. Cocoa and liquorice linger in the background. Flavors are very appropriate but I really have to breathe deep for this one. 
T: Opens chocolate, prune, plum, and sweet soy sauce. Bourbon presence is prominent but not overwhelming. A good compliment to the base flavors. Roasted malt, honey, and cocoa powder towards the middle. Heat increases a bit. Finish is milk chocolate and sweet, dark fruit. Aftertaste is the same with bourbon added. 
M: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth, oily, and filmy in the mouth. Slight heat and coarseness around the edges. Goes down smooth and coats the palate. Finish is messy with a pleasant, lingering aftertaste. 
D: Clearly one of the better -bal aged brews due to its overall subtlety. Feel is not super heavy and spirits are not overwhelming here. The barrel complements the beer here. Not the other way around. Definitely worth seeking out. 1,359 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 12, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From the 2010 release party bottling. Shared with Habmike, Kkipple, SpencerDB, RobOrb and Advent. Many thanks to a kind mule.
Appearance: Looks basically like the rest of the 50/50 barrel aged lineup; small head, some lacing, dark pour with some mahogany brown edges.
Smell: I hate saying each of these smells like bourbon but they truly do smell like the brands of bourbon they used for the barrels. If you have not had each of the bourbons several times (enough times to pick them out of a 7 bourbon lineup) you won't have the fun wow factor of smelling and tasting each of them. After the bourbon I got a good bit of vanilla, caramel, fudge brownie chocolate and oak.
Taste: Again, the Elija Craig dominates - I can't imagine there is much character to the base beer itself besides a nice sweetness as the barrels really dominate the beer. After that there is an enjoyable fudge, vanilla toffee flavor to it.
Mouthfeel: Like to rest of the lineup, mouthfeel is the only slightly disappointing aspect. carbonation was perhaps a bit light.
Drinkability: Drinkable and enjoyable. It is funny we powered through 6 of these with no problem but were ready to cut our tongues out with a FW10-13 tasting.
We did a big side-by-side and I would rate them in this order: Pappy 50/50; Evan Williams 50/50; Elijah Craig 50/50; 4 Roses 50/50; Heaven Hill 50/50 (noticeably worse than the rest); Brandy 50/50 (Brandy being a drain pour). It was fun to try them side-by-side, each is incredibly distinct and there are certainly some winners and some losers. 1,550 characterscraytonic, Jan 10, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I'm a big fan of Elijah Craig bourbon so it's great to have a chance to try a stout aged in EC barrels. 
A: Pours non-opaque dark brown without a great deal of head. Some lacing lingers after the pour.
S: lots of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and oak. 
T: One of the better-tasting barrel-aged stouts I have had. Heavy bourbon in this, but it works. Fairly sweet, with plenty of vanilla, toffee, and chocolate character. No heat, and not particularly boozy. Little hop presence. So right up my alley, as I don't care for hoppy stouts (e.g., some Abyss vintages), and get annoyed when crazy high ABV beers are bottled in bombers or 750s. 
M: As with all Eclipses, this is medium-bodied and will slightly disappoint those who think a barrel aged stout is required to be thick. Great in my opinion, though. Carbonation is light to moderate.
D: Overall, one of the best bourbon barrel-aged stouts I have had. Love all the different barrel treatments Fifty Fifty is doing with this. 980 characterswaltonc, Jan 09, 2011
3.95/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4'09 Elijah Craig - 1yr old. jet black, thin large-bubbled head is coaxed with a vigorous pour but remains. Nose at first shows a dusty, oxidized malt, some unsweet bourbon, and a light soy. Reminds of aged 7000 without as much of the robust malt. Flavor is hotter up front, a thin but delicate body reminds of a nice rum-candy with warmth on the mid-palate, with some wood and cocoa through the lengthy finish, dry finish. Body and malt profile are a bit washed out but also chewy and overly sweet, some unfermented sugars remaining amidst near-balance. Still, I personally find the light body and lack of strong malt to be a trend growing too common from stout experimenters like CCB, Bruery, and now 50-50. And yet there is a ton of bourbon in this, which I've hardly mentioned, and I think this is because the bourbon blends so well with the base beer flavors. 863 charactersMrChopin, Dec 28, 2010
4.21/5  rDev -5%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Rec'd this bottle (#1105 from 2009) from jhenry04 in a killer trade. Thanks for giving me a chance to try this. 
Appearance is lacking...really no head to speak of. Super thin ring of light colored foam aroud the edges and some neat looking spotting at the top of the liquid. Not inky black but close. 
Smell is amazing! Bourbon, chocolate and hefty malt come through in a sweet and decadent scent that is exactly what I want out of a barrel aged beer.
Taste is dynamic. Flavors start with bitter chocolate, sweet chocolate, scotch then coffee. Finish is bourbon with a tad too much heat and bitterness for me. Still, I can see where most would think this great. I guess while I get a lot of flavor out of this, it doesn't have as much integration as I'd like.
Mouthfeel is solid - medium carnonation and perfect amount of heft on the tongue. 
Drinkability is hurt by the heat and bitterness. I really want to like this beer but I can't get myself to enjoy this one as much as I want to. That being said, I want to try the other versions and compare. 1,055 charactersGoGriz, Dec 19, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to cloudskipper for this bottle of '09 Elijah Craig. Just rec'd bottles of the current batch from the excellent folks at FiftyFifty, so I figured we'd celebrate by kicking the last one from '09. Split with my wife. As a side note, after the kick-ass Heaven Hill bottle, she insisted on auditing the pours to assure that I hadn't jacked her out of 1/5 of an ounce. Turn a girl on to big stouts & see what happens? Bottle #596. 
Pours black, with a surprising twinkle of red around the edges. Smell is subdued, barrel, malts, good but not over-the-top. 
The Elijah Craig version brings on inevitable comparisons to the Heaven Hill, which isn't quite fair (comparing anything to that near perfection). The whiskey is obviously different, rougher, giving off John Wayne vibes vs. the Ivy League tumbler of the 'Hill. The roughness bleeds through the taste. The malts seem unsettled, a bit at war with the stapled chocolates, long pull of nuttiness, chocolate, arsenic (OK, I haven't actually tasted arsenic, but I bet it's like this). Lots of minor chords, but the slash-and-burn whiskey rides roughshod over the subtleties. 
Excellent beer. If it weren't fairly rare & expensive, this would be a great beer to crack open around a campfire deep in the wilderness after shedding my chaps for the day. Looking forward to trying more varieties of Eclipse. 1,358 charactersmaximum12, Dec 18, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My first review and it is a winner.
Pours into a tulip glass a deep dark black with a faint line of tan foam.
A wonderful aroma of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, Bourbon and oaks.
The first taste matches the aroma, sweet vanilla and chocolate melded with a smooth bourbon taste. Nothing overwhelms other flavors in this complex beer.
A rich fairly full profile, sweet but enough bourbon to not be too sticky.
Very drinkable especially for a beer with this level of bourbon.
I liked this beer more as it came up to temperature, the aromas and the flavors just kept improving. 578 charactersYnot2, Dec 10, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5When this beer first came out I thought that the Heaven Hill Rye was better. As time went on the reviews kept favoring the Elijah Craig version. Well last Wednesday the year old Elijah Craig was on tap and it was perfection. I was absolutely floored by how good this had aged in the keg.
The appearance on this is dark black with lighter mohagony edges. It is poured with a nice one finger head that develops into a film over the entire beer. Nice alcoholic legs that are now a standard with these Eclipse releases. 
I could not keep my nose out of my snifter. Absolutely perfect. Vanilla, caramel, chocolate, toffee, coffee, sweet whisky sugars, a little bit of marshmelow. 
It kept getting better and better every time I took a sip of this magnificant brew. Everything that I could smell was beautifully integrated in the beer. The notes of strong chocolate were being muted by vanilla and caramel, slight hints of coffee were accompanied by the roasted grains and strong sense of barrel. The whisky was not overly powering but integrated perfectly with other flavors. I mention in a few of my reviews how barrels push flavors to the brink. I do say that the flavors on this beer are not overpowering in any way. Overall incredibly impressed with the age on this one. 
Outstanding.

4.49/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009 - Purple Wax - Bottle# 850
Pours into my glass a deep brooding black with a small dark tan head that quickly fades. Bit under carbonated. No light getting through this brew. Aromas start off with smooth dark roasted malts, chocolate and honey. Vanilla and sweet bright bourbon alongside an oak barrel character. Bourbon is really well integrated and draws you in.
First sip brings smooth dark malts, chocolate truffle upfront with honey sweet accents. Bourbon rolls in with caramel and vanilla flavors. Woody oak barrel as it flows down with a touch of spiciness. Smooth and well balanced, the bourbon is perfectly integrated here. Wonderful.
Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. A bit slick with mellow carbonation. I enjoy the fact that this is not overly heavy. Overall, this is a great bourbon aged stout with well integrated flavors that all hit the right marks. Really happy to have been able to sample this and looking forward to the 2010 versions. 965 charactersorbitalr0x, Nov 20, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz purple waxed bottle shared with the usual suspects at the Brick Store.
Pours almost completely black with hints of light showing through the mahogany edges. Head recedes fairly quickly leaving some spotty lacing.
The aroma has more whiskey presence than the Pappy and Heaven Hill. It's got whiskey, vanilla and lots of chocolate on top of the heavily roasted black malts. Some hints of leather and tobacco.
Again, the bourbon really comes out in the taste up front. Vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts and maybe even some dark fruits hiding underneath. The finish is boozy and a bit dry, certainly compared to the other treatments I've had.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied and almost slick with some soft carbonation and definitely influenced by the bourbon.
As usual for Fifty Fifty, this is barrel aging at it's very best. I think I like the more nuanced character of the Heaven Hill but, hey, that's a seriously high bar. Outstanding. 944 charactersgford217, Nov 09, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Tasted in a Spiegelau tulip during a RIS tasting (with plain crackers and water for palate cleansing between tastings).
A thin, brown, lightly opaque pour with a thin, short lasting head. 
On the nose this is boozy and rich, chocolate and more chocolate with some fruity esters.
And if you'd stopped me here I'd have said I was fully expecting to be disappointed... but then it hit my palate.
Great, great, great barrel character. Toffee and brown sugar sweetness with that intense cocoa and roast hinted at by the chocolate on the nose. Rich, decadent, but balanced and enormously complex.
Medium-full body with a rich viscosity, this nevertheless doesn't quite have the truly full, silky body of the very best (in mouthfeel) beers in this style, but all faults are overwhelmed by that sublime flavor. 807 characterserrantnight, Oct 16, 2010

A: Black body with a thin dark tan head of rich foam. Looks good, but not quite great.
S: Sweet, oaky, vanilla, caramel goodness. Amazingly well-integrated barrel notes, with the bourbon only noticeable in a subdued, nuanced way. I can't really imagine a better-smelling stout.
T: Bourbon takes over more here, but not to an irredeemable point. Impressive, but not quite as splendid as the nose.
M: Very sweet, sticky, and rich. I'm loving it.
D: Intense bourbon flavor isn't necessarily the most drinkable aspect a beer can have, but this one is drinkable nonetheless.
Notes: Gigantic thanks to Tony for being so generous as to share this rare and delicious -bal aged awesomeness. I don't know what else to say about this one - it's great. I wish I had the ammo to put together a horizontal tasting of all the Eclipse beers, as that would be the definition of epicness.

Nose is a lot of that really round, big malt, bourbon, wood, vanilla. Quite smooth and rich. Mouth is a lot of oak and vanilla up front segueing into a rich, fairly boozy bourbon finish. Spicy and showcasing a lot of vanilla. Mouth is thin. This is quite, quite good, not as hefty as I though it might be but just impressive flavor profile. 421 charactersJAXSON, Oct 04, 2010
4.64/5  rDev +4.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle into Delirium Noël glass. Bottle #49. Bottled 2009. This is apparently my 200th review, although I did not plan it. It turns out this is a very fitting (amazing) beer to mark this occasion. 
A: Pours a deep black with dark brown highlights. Hardly any head or lace. After a moment this beer is flat looking with just a slight bubbly collar around the glass.
S: Big notes of bourbon, vanilla and oak. Amazing smelling. Also picking up powdered cocoa and maybe the slightest hint of dark cherries and sweet honey. 
T: The barrel really came out in this one with dominant flavors of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. There is an overall honey sweetness and buttery richness to this brew. Aftertaste is full of honey that seems to coat your mouth. Light coffee and chocolate syrup throughout. 
M: Fairly thick and sticky. Very viscous but damn near flat with a touch of rough tannins to round out the finish. Alcohol is warm but incredibly smooth. Low carbonation. 
D: This one took imperial stout to a new level for me. What an amazingly rich and flavorful yet smooth and drinkable beer. I could easily finish off a bottle of this by myself. What a wonderful beer. 1,168 charactersscottfrie, Sep 26, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared by Grant, compared to the Heaven Hill he brought last week - many thanks!
Pours black with a half-finger light brown head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving solid lacing.
Smells of smooth roasted malts with large amounts of vanilla from the barrels. Also present are hints of dark chocolate and traces of alcohol.
Tastes very similar to how it smells. Robust roasted malt flavors kick things off and are quickly joined by well-integrated dark chooclate and vanilla flavors. Midway through the sip the vanilla flavors take over a bit before fading out into a mildly bitter ending.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a smooth thickness with grainy carbonation.
Drinkability is also very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall this beer was much more of a bourbon bomb than the HH version. Still a very nice beer but the complexity and nuance of the HH version was lost on this one. Very much worth a shot but thus far my second favorite of the series. 1,021 charactersglid02, Sep 10, 2010

Bottle #1152, I have only previously had the Pappy version which was outstanding. But this was a whole new level. Served damn near room temperature for most of the session, this one was
consumed on 07/11/2010.
Pours dark as night, abyss like with no color coming through and the viscosity of oil. Small head of tan peaks up fro just a moment before settling back down to earth and leaving a mostly bare top that had some decent lacing down the glass, 
but never really did recover.
Aroma is deep vanilla and boozy notes. Hits you like a ton of bricks right from the start. Amazing depth here, dark chocolate goo, rich roasted coffee that provides a touch of bitterness to the back end. Toffee, wood notes and as it really hit its peak a dark fruit that almost came across kind of smoky. Rich, thick profile, really like chewing on it as it goes down and you feel every drop of this one. Vanilla leads that charge with a soaking dose of whiskey and cocoa. Extremely mean flavor as each sip wanted to destroy my body on me, really un cool, but I wanted it. Final taste was a long boozy vanilla that mixed well with a light coffee bitterness to seal the deal.
Overall really just a great, great beer. I am not sure what more you could ask for in a BA RIS, other then a bit bigger of a look. But damn, this one laid me out. 1,438 charactersmikesgroove, Jul 12, 2010

M: Beautifully boozy with plenty of bourbon; just the right territory for an imperial stout.

4.82/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a very deep brown. Not quite black as it's not entirely opaque, especially in front of light. No real carbonation or lacing to speak of.
S - Smell is complex and incredibly well balanced. A little heat at first from the barrel, with notes of coffee, licorice, and brown sugar.
T - Taste is as delicious as the smell. With every sip I swirl it on my tongue for a bit before swallowing to get the full body. Not quite as good as the Heaven Hill was in my opinion but the difference doesn't change the 5 rating
M - The low carbonation gives it a smooth taste, caramelizing in the mouth before being swallowed. Not too sticky, but the highlights of the taste complexities stick around after the liquid is gone.
D - Though I love Imperial Stouts, 1 bottle usually pretty much does me in for a night. However, this one somehow packs a backdoor drinkability. Along with its incredibly complex flavors, I find myself just wanting more and more of it. 
Unfortunately this is my last of my bottles that isn't for trading with the exception of my 1 EC and 1 HH I have aging, but those are for another time. Can't wait to try these two again with some settling time. 1,169 charactersshortysdude285, May 12, 2010

A- very good, dark, thick, with a nice tan head. Almost no light get through look similar to the JD version.
S & T - i really liked this one, i could taste the bourbon and the beer which worked very well together unlike the Heaven hill version which destroyed my tastes.
M & D - good thick body just like the JD but not as thick and coating as the HH version. This one was easy to enjoy the full bomber over a couple of hours to enjoy the nice flavor changes as the tempature rises.
End of the day i would probably rank the Eclipse series a little different than most, i would put it in this order
1. Elijah Craig
2. Jack Daniels 
3. Heaven Hill (best mouthfeel by far!!) 716 charactersJWD, May 01, 2010
4.64/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4100th review! 22oz bomber into a snifter. Bottle number 1127. 2009 Vintage.
A: Pours a deep/pitch black with a tiny dark brown head that barely rose up after pouring it pretty vigoursly. It disappeared faster than it took to rise up and leave a small bit of lacing.
S: The nose is very similar to GI BCS with tons of vanilla, chocolate, and molasses. I've yet to find a beer close to the intensity of the BCS but I think I found it here.
T: The taste is similar too but it has a buttery element that I've never experienced before. Lots of roasty cocoa and vanilla with a molasses backbone. This is good stuff.
M: This is the surprising characteristic that I wasn't expecting...it's pretty thin. I wouldn't say it detracts from the beer but I'd like to see it a bit thicker. Still I think it sets this one apart from BCS.
D: This is a damn good barrel aged stout and one I would love to drink on a regular basis if it wasn't so expensive and limited. ABV is a bit high as well but I don't see that being a problem.
Great beer and I'm glad I chose this one for my 100th. I'd love to try this in a year or so. 1,112 charactersGregSVT, Apr 17, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Lightly chilled bottle into a glass. 
My first impression, after having this on tap, was that this is the weakest of the 3 2009 versions. My second impression, upon having the bottled form side-by-side with the Heaven Hill, is Oh My Lord God Thank You For This Bounty. 
A: Pours a dark brown, translucent at the edges. It's not really black. The head is short-lived, very thin, a light tan cap. It's easily the weakest part of the beer. 
S: Buttery, toasted oak. Caramelly bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, raisins, molasses, and some booze. 
T: A bourbon bomb, but it doesn't overwhelm the other flavors. Bourbon, caramel, buttery oak, nuts, vanilla, chocolate, molasses. A hint of anise and dark fruit near the finish. I'm going to guess French oak on the barrels, seeing as how the flavor is softly tannic and nutty in the finish. 
M: It's very low on carbonation. Creamy, smooth. Hard to beat, really. Not a thick, chewy stout: it's pretty lacking in viscosity, in fact. Well-attenuated. But it's very full in flavor, and that makes all the difference for me. 
D: It's very easy to finish a full bottle of this beer, which isn't something I can say often about a barrel-aged imperial stout. It's $20-$22 a bottle, which is pricey... But this is one of the few beers I've had that is truly worth it. Amazing? You're damn right. On tap, I felt this was inferior to the Heaven Hill version. Out of the bottles, no question: I think this is easily the best of the 3. Where have you been all my life?!??
My only complaint is that they supposedly didn't blend the barrels, so you could potentially have massive bottle variation in this beer. That's very disappointing to hear. However, I've had 6 bottles of this so far, and each one has been amazing (yet slightly different)... 1,778 charactersArbitrator, Apr 07, 2010

It smelled pretty similar to the Heaven Hill Rye with a little bit more roasted flavors and a light bourbon nose. It tasted a bit more roasted, more bitter with espresso & toffee notes.

Bottle #65 of the 2009 vintage poured into my Bruery snifter. Dark brown tinged deep crimson with a one finger light brown head lingers for a minute and leaves a little lacing when it recedes.
Prominent bourbon accompanies rich chocolate and illustrious caramel notes. As the beer warms to room temperature, vanilla and oak are more apparent. Alcohol vapor is quite mellow in the nose, and there's just a shadow of coffee behind the bourbon, chocolate, and caramel. 
The flavor opens up with a touch of alcohol that's quickly eclipsed by bourbonic caramel and chocolate. There's something about the flavor of this beer that reminds me a lot of Firestone 13. Perhaps it's the interplay between the caramel and bourbon. Regardless, it's a good thing. The restrained presence of roasted malt and even lighter presence of coffee make this a smooth and mellow bourbon Imperial Stout. The heat is at an ideal level for me, neither too mellow nor stinging. The beer is lightly sweet, but it dries out in the lightly astringent, warming, and caramel bourbon finish. 
The mouthfeel is silky and creamy, with a really nice upper low level of carbonation. There's a little astringency and there's a drying woody quality. Overall, this is a top notch bourbon Imperial Stout. 1,276 charactersHopHead84, Mar 23, 2010

The pour is a gorgeous black with reddish brown highlights. A Dense brown head caps this beer with great retention and some lace. A fine looking beer, this.
The nose is excellent.Creamy with some caramel and a beautiful boozy character, there's bourbon and oaky vanilla. Moderate coffee, chocolate syrup. However, this really is dominated by the barrel without being hot or tannic. 
The palate opens with just a beautiful bourbon barrel character; there's caramel, vanilla and of course, a moderately boozy bourbon bite. Behind this is milk chocolate, a moderate coffee character and a very pleasant roast character. A little licorice is appears before the finish that's an excellent balance of roasty bitterness, sweet caramel and vanilla and booze. The mouthfeel is quite mindblowing, medium to full in body with a soft and gentle carbonation, and the finish is just exceptional.The balance between the barrel sweetness and the roasted bitterness character of the base beer makes this one of the better imperial stouts I've had in recent memory, this is immensely drinkable. 1,255 charactersDefenCorps, Mar 21, 2010

Wow, the aroma is strong and wonderful! Tons of bourbon and roasted coffee. The booze is very prominent. If you like stouts, you'll be in love with the aroma of this beer...sweet and inviting...mouth watering if you will!
What an awesome beer! The bourbon just adds complexity and warmth to a great backbone. Tons of malty sweetness, chocolate, roasted barley...just totally sweet, but not overkill or overwhelming. Full body, creamy, and semi-thick, yet excelent drinkability. Carbonation is perfect for this beer. Overall...and again, what an awesome beer! 816 charactersShadesOfGray, Mar 14, 2010

It has a very nice Imperial stout aroma; warm, bitter black malts, soft chocolate character, excellent oak contribution. It seems pretty earthy up front with loads of oak. I can't get enough of this aroma; quite intoxicating. The taste is great as well. It has a very smooth chocolate malt flavor with a mild black malt earthiness and oak character. The aroma indicated otherwise, but this is a nice surprise. It goes down sweet with a very nice chocolate character and finishes with some subtle black malt notes and a mild oak feel. It's not overly oaky. In fact, it's noticeable, but it's just another element in a very complex and highly drinkable beer . The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a killer IS. I'd like to kick back and sip on this one for a while, but I guess I'll just enjoy the four ounce pour in my glass. 967 charactersWesWes, Mar 04, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Opened this in the garage, and it was a bit of a struggle to get through the wax with my random tools; the point of this story was that from the second my screwdriver popped the seal (a minute or so before the crown actually finagled off) the garage smelled like booze...sweet, refined, woody, malty whiskey. Good God! Almost Parabola-like amount of sticky sweet bourbon dominate the nose, simply taking over the aroma albeit for a tiny bit of roasted grains. 
Poured in a Stone RIS goblet. Lively carbonation but the foam does not persist. Looks like Sweet Stout from Lost Abbey the way it randomly has brown suger cling-ins around the glass.
It's one of those beers, if it's your first beer of the night it may seem a bit overkill with bourbon notes. But if you sample it at a festival, it will stand out as one of the most memorable beers. 
Sweet, sticky, malty bourbon, fumes, chocolate malt and roasted barley, really delicious like dessert, and extremely drinkable. 22oz was no problem to drink and required much restraint; Abyss is one of my all time favorites but it's still a challenge to drink a whole bomber. Abyss gets me extremely wasted, but after 22oz of this I am feeling great and refreshed (we'll see about tomorrow morning). Drinkability is a perfect 5.
Creamy mouthfeel. Not the absolute perfect beer, but the more you think about it, the more you can't find anything you'd want to change. Absolutely great!

Seriously pitch black, I can see my reflection in the glass. Half finger bubbly khaki head. Good retention. Head resides to covering half the surface of the beer and good head around the edge of the brew that is touching glass.
Lots of fragrance as soon as the bottle is opened. Smells like dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut, and pistachio. Also, sweet chocolate malts and alcohol.
Tastes like vanilla, chocolate, coconut, bourbon, nut oil (almond, peanut, pistachio).
This beer is quite heavy. Fairly well carbonated, and medium dry.
Good drinkability. Especially for the abv. 681 charactersbillshmeinke, Feb 10, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 batch.
Dark and opaque chocolate brown in color, topped by a tiny 1/4 inch head that quickly settles to the thinnest of rings. There's faint translucency around the edges.
The Elijah Craig bourbon barrel imparted a huge mark on this beer - it absolutely reeks of sweet caramel, vanilla and oak. While the Heaven Hill Rye and Jack Daniels versions of this beer have well-integrated and somewhat balanced barrel characters, this one is dominated by bourbon. The chocolatey, roasty, bready base beer is still present, but it's more of a foundation for the incredible aromas the barrel has imparted.
It's equally bourbon-forward on the tongue, opening with flavors of maple syrup, dark fruit, vanilla and honey. The mid-palate brings out a balancing roastiness, hints of licorice and burnt toast. The body is medium-full and creamy, though not especially viscous or oily. The finish is bittersweet and hot, like a liqueur-filled chocolate. 943 characterslargadeer, Jan 26, 2010

A: dark and opaque; the barely-there head is kinda filmy
S: faint syrup, this thing promises to be sweet, although there are cocoa flavors that hopefully balances it
T: yum, it IS sweet, although it's more like chocolate
M: really nice, stays on the tongue a bit
D: highly quaffable for something that seems (IS!) so dangerous 359 charactersChambic, Jan 25, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Oh wow, look how awesome I am, I'm reviewing this super-rarity again. "Jersey Shore," you will rue the day you rejected me from your show, mark my words! Bottle this time, provided at a cigar tasting by Sandstone. Thanks, Roger. This beer was excellent.
Pours jet black with a nicely formed small tan head and a little lacing. Looks a bit better than the tap version.
Aroma is really great, with vanilla, whiskey, sweet rich chocolate, and roastiness.
Flavor is also excellent. You have your typical imperial stout flavors - roast, chocolate, and mild coffee - all really intense and in your face, then you've got your -bal aged flavors - vanilla, oak, and whiskey. Mild hop bitterness as well that I didn't get as much of on tap. All this melds really well together, with just some mild tannins to keep it from a perfect 5.
Fairly full and smooth on the palate with low carbonation and just a slight hint of booziness.
Drinkability is pretty good, and overall, this is really a great beer. Get it if you can. I recommend sending me a bottle of Midnight Sun M in exchange for this. 1,086 charactersnickd717, Jan 25, 2010
4.09/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to my buddy Jmoore50 for picking this up and letting me have a glass. As a disclaimer, I will say that the rating I've given it reflects what I believe it deserves, but not what I think of the beer. What I mean is that this beer has HUGE potential (A+ for sure), but is a little rough around the edges.
The appearance is a little lighter than I like my imperial stouts and the body looks thin. There is little to head to speak of, but some milk-chocolate colored bubbles do break the surface. The smell is the best part of the beer. The barrel aging has done wonders for this beer. Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, sweet dark fruits (chocolate covered cherries), among other things.
The flavors follows the smell closely, and I'm torn between a 4.5 and 4 rating (can I give it a 4.25?). It's pretty hot and the whiskey profile gives makes me think of it as the little brother of BCS. Lots of chocolate throughout, and a nice (almost coffee) roast in the finish. Hints of vanilla and hazel-nut (which I absolute love in imperial stouts), with an imposing sweetness up front that levels out the bitter roastiness in the finish. It has its fair share of alcohol throughout, but especially on the back of the palate and in the esophagus. It almost tastes a little watered down. Good beer that could be seriously great.
The moutfeel is that of a porter (much too thin for an imperial stout) and is the biggest disappointment of the beer. However, this adds to drinkability as this one goes down VERY easily.
Looking forward to (hopefully) trying the other versions, and to seeing how the brewing of this beer evolves over the next few years. 1,643 charactersjdklks, Jan 15, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Just got back form snowboarding at North Star, stopped by FiftyFifty on the way home to give the RIS a try. When I sat with my brother I noticed 4 barrels of the RIS aging next to the hostess stand with Jack Daniels brazed on to the face of the barrel. 
A - Came in a rather tasty looking package of an 8 OZ tulip glass, the head was a nice mocha brown and the body of the beer was a thick viscus black. As I drank it down the Stout coated the walls of the glass with a thick brown residue and lased fairly well. 
S - There was a good amount of roasted barley with Bourbon coming through. Slight Notes of Honey and Vanilla.
T - Wonderful RIS. The Strong Chocolate and toffee notes play strong against the Bourbon. The beer is pleasantly sweet while not being too cloying. Lots of Roasted Barley and dark malts come through. There seems to be a hint of dark fruit that lingers towards the giving a complex profile. 
M - Perfection here. The right amount of carbonation and thickness of the beer make it feel so creamy. Just the right aftertaste is left behind.
O - This beer is wonderful, its very complex yet so very drinkable. Cant wait to try some more. 1,160 charactersDwnTwnBwn, Jan 06, 2010
