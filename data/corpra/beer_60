This was on the top of my list to try at the festival and was actually my first Fremont beer ever. It definitely lives up to the hype - it is technically an American strong ale, but it drinks like an imperial stout. The coffee and cinnamon are perfectly balanced - neither overwhelms. 335 charactersArkyVaughan, Feb 14, 2017

Aroma: Rich aroma of coffee and vanilla. The bourbon really comes through. Roasted chocolate and biscuit from the malts. Just a hint of alcohol.Earthy hops.
Appearance: Beer pours midnight brown with head the color of coffee and milk. Delicate bubbles form the modest head, which subsides relatively quickly.
Taste: Dark chocolate and burnt coconut on the front. Chocolate, black, and biscuit malts.Clean fermentation with no DMS or fusel alcohols and small amounts of diacytel and esters.Enough sweetness to balance the alcohol without being cloying.
Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy mouthfeel with alcoholic warmth. Tingly sensation in the aftertaste from the cinnamon.
Overall impression: Delightful, well-balanced beer and eminently drinkable. Rich chocolate and coffee with just a hint of cinnamon to keep things interesting. 841 charactersO_Cervejeiro, Jan 15, 2017

appearance: very dark brown/ black in the glass. Not much foam but nice alcohol legs. Looks like a stout. 
aroma: initially cinnamon, oak, and booze. 
taste: big cinnamon and vanilla up front. Coffee mingles mid palate with oak, tobacco, dark fruits, smoke, etc. Lots going on here, wow. 
mouthfeel: medium body, not very viscous, some decent carbonation. Doesn't quite make the beer any better.
Overall, a very cinnamon forward strong ale that I very much enjoyed. However, I feel the spices and coffee overwhelm the already complex beer underneath. These spices would go much better with a more basic tasting beer, such as some Prairie offerings. 727 charactersraynmoon, Dec 15, 2016

Thick and dark, dark caramel-like appearance. Creamy looking. Thin tan head
Smell and taste follow each other. Cinnamon and coffee are very mellow. Nicely balanced with the malts due to the barrel aging. Not getting a ton of the bourbon but the oak really fits in nicely with these flavors. Caramel and toffee heavy
Creamy and not boozy at all. 
Overall a nice enjoyable winter ale. Fremont barreling is very impressive and very underrated. This may have been a tad overhyped but it was an excellent beer. Glad I am able to have had this 587 charactersrabbott2, Oct 16, 2016

A: Pours jet black with a few cm of dense, espresso-like head.  Very good retention for the ring of head that’s there, and a few dots of lacing.  
S: Nose is cinnamon and soft dark roast coffee, which I suspect has mostly faded by this point, along with light roast character and dried dark fruit (grape, blackcurrant).  
T: Taste is cinnamon (very prominent but not overpowering), soft dark roast coffee, licorice, giving way to a subtle dark dried fruit and roast on a lengthy finish.
M: Round, full body with light carbonation gives this a decadent feeling.  Medium-light alcohol warmth. 
O: Overall, this is an elegant and tasty beer, almost completely different from the BA Abominable.  This is more coffee stout-ish and less like a BA old ale, though a bit of dried fruit does come through.  The cinnamon really adds an interesting dimension and appears at a perfect level. 913 characterspmarlowe, May 23, 2016

O: This may be the best beer ive ever experienced. Tried both 2014 and 2015, both were fantastic. The 2015 is a higher % but doesnt sacrifice on the taste at all. 487 charactersStardusthotel83, May 02, 2016

This pours nearly black, very dark brown- looks like a stout to me. There's a very small head, and basically no lacing.
Smells wonderful, silky and creamy coffee, sweet cinnamon, oak, vanilla, and coconut.
The barrel-aging here is magnificent, you get oak, vanilla and coconut from it, with just a bit of bourbon. It all melds well with the sweet coffee and cinnamon character, with some cocoa powder and toffee. This is friggin' decadent, and so, so tasty. I could drink this all day.
This has a really wonderful creamy and silky mouthfeel, with a normal level of carbonation for the style.
This was absolutely superb. Cheers Fremont. 691 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 11, 2016

4.37/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 42014 vintage. Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Fremont "can" glass. Acquired as an extra in a trade. Note that ABV on label is stated as 11%, not 14% as is currently listed on BeerAdvocate.
Pours a brown, nearly black, stout-like body with a mocha colored head that reduces at a moderate rate to leave a ring of brown foam, a little lacing but not much.
Right off the bat you can smell heavy bourbon aromas, specifically vanilla and sweet caramel, toffee, sweet molasses, milk chocolate, maybe a hint of coffee but not much really. Cinnamon is non-existent in the aromas. 
On the tongue are smooth, rich notes of sweet caramel, bourbon, sweet milk chocolate, vanilla, followed by the adjunct ingredients - first light cinnamon, then a nice roasty, toasted flavor presumably from the coffee.
I do love the mouthfeel of this brew - it may be the best attribute. Extremely rich and creamy, easy to drink, thick, velvety with low carbonation. 
A very nice brew. Reminds me more of a stout than a strong ale. Had to take -0.5 off the final rating because there simply wasn't enough cinnamon or coffee in both the flavor and aroma. Overall world class though. 1,158 charactersgcamparone, Apr 04, 2016

4.25 A:  Murky black color.  About one finger of creamy beige head forms and lasts a brief while before falling back into a short ring.  About as good as it gets for a beer this big.
4.5 S:  Great nose on this!  Great interplay between the barrel, coffee, and cinnamon.  The coffee in particular comes off as rich and creamy, like a well frothed cappuccino.  Lots of oak, vanilla, leathery bourbon.  The base is strong with caramel and milk chocolate.  Supple roastiness, toffee, with fruits a plenty - plum and fig dominate with currants and raisins.
4.5 T:  Again this is great.  I drank half the bottle before I re-realized that this is 14%.  It seems impossible that such a number is correct.  The booze isn't found in the nose or the taste.  The coffee and barrel lead the flavors.  The cinnamon is much harder to find.  Leather, oak, and tons of vanilla.  Light roast with layers of caramel, hints of toffee and molasses.  Fruits per above.  Chocolate to round things off.
5.0 M:  This is where this already great beer hits the next level.  It's silky smooth and velvety as if it were on nitro.  Perfect creamy carbonation.  Heavier medium body.  Again, the booze doesn't even register.  It doesn't even warm on finish.
4.5 D:  Damn good beer.  Great nose, taste, and a killer mouthfeel.  Can't wait to get into the other Fremont beer I just got. 1,395 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 21, 2016

It looks like an imperial stout except it had a very large head for such a strong beer. Aroma is the mildest cinnamon, almost pepper-like, hints of coffee and strong bourbon barrels. Flavor is a really nice bourbon barrel strong ale with notes of coffee and almost no cinnamon. This is a high quality beer. 400 charactersArrogantB, Mar 06, 2016

Thick and dark brownie batter spiked with chocolate covered espresso beans and a sweet spicy cinnamon blanket that ties everything together... Very warm from front to back with the EtOH and the spicy bark... Very proper... I don't normally care for cinnamon in beers, but it definitely works with this setting.

Tan head. Dark brown color.
This beer has it going on. Perfect bourbon and oak. Awesome vanilla, coffee, and cinnamon. The right amount of spice. Chocolate and caramel. Toffee. Everything in the flavor is so well done.
Full bodied. Nice amount of heat. Warmin. Smooth. I can't get over this. Well done. 318 charactersmothman, Feb 20, 2016

As I linger over the glass, perhaps a hint of tobacco or leather. The taste is much like the smell. Dark chocolate dominates, with a hint of cinnamon and coffee. I don't get a lot of bourbon, but that's ok. This is a great beer, maybe a bit sweeter than I prefer, but outstanding. Certainly in the top handful of beers I've had.
I cellared one for next Christmas. We'll see how it compares. 507 charactersrarigney, Feb 16, 2016

Pours a deep black coffee colour with bit foamy dark tan head which slowly settles to a thin layer. Gorgeous look in the glass. 
Big upfront notes of bourbon with background notes of cold pressed coffee followed by spicy cinnamon. Reminds me of a chocolate cinnamon cake. 
Tons of bourbon in the flavour, wet wood, sweet coffee and cinnamon. Sweet malts, toffee and caramel together with hints of dark chocolate in the middle. Finishes with a slight bourbon heat and an aftertaste of cinnamon oil.
Mouthfeel is slick, smooth and coating.  
This is another incredible barrel aged beer from Fremont that is definitely worth seeking out. 652 charactersFondueVoodoo, Feb 14, 2016

The coffee is still present but subdued as is the cinnamon...  They are there both in the aromas and flavors but do nothing to detract from the base beer...  Smooth and creamy and delicious, this is extremely dangerous as the 14% is non existent..  Brilliant...  Fremont is killing it...  I love everything that they put out up there...  I've had this for quite some time and wish that I had opened it on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day...  This is just... special...  Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, coffee....  Not even going to try to describe the complexity exhibited here...  Just know that this is world class all around...  I will do my best to acquire this beer every year moving forward...  I've had the base beer on several different occasions and it is a world class beer in its own right.  However, the addition of the coffee and cinnamon send this into a class of its own...  Big thanks to Mark for sending this down to me.. 1,051 charactersTilley4, Feb 07, 2016

I got a good hit of cinnamon in the aroma but was subtle in the taste overall. Very, very smooth as I mentioned. Seemed to have aged well and finishes easy and not overly coffee or cinnamon ladened. Both are subtle and tasty to me that I very much enjoyed throughout. - 4.29
Update: 2015 version on 7/16/16
Found this new version even better. The C/C were obviously more prominent but I rather liked it that way. Still smoother than you may think it will be. - 4.5 536 charactersSound_Explorer, Feb 04, 2016

A-The beer pours with a tall, tan head. The foam is dense and retention is pretty good. The beer leaves no lacing, which is not unexpected from a 14.0% monster. Color is very, very dark brown...almost black.
S-The aroma is heavy on the cinnamon, but I don't feel like I'm sniffing a pumpkin beer or some other spice bomb. It works well with the brewed coffee, caramel, and sweet vanilla flavors from the barrel. I also sniff some chocolate and molasses. The beer is a mess in the traditional sense, but I like it.
T-The taste is much like the smell. Heavy cinnamon, dark chocolate, brewed coffee, caramel, brown sugar, and a good dose of bourbon tinged alcohol heat. The bitterness is muted and this beer is pretty sweet, but if that is what you are after, you won't find many better examples. A perfect dessert beer.
M-The body is medium to heavy with a fine carbonation that isn't overly intrusive, but gives just enough levity to the beer to keep it from becoming cloying.
O-Wow. This beer ranks up there among my favorites all time. It is a bit of a mess, but it is the best kind of mess with lots of flavors, really good balance, nice layering, and a good look and feel. This is a monster with a lot of sweetness, but for a once-a-year treat, this beer is damn near perfect. 1,332 charactersspoony, Jan 18, 2016

This one is no different. Wow.
Look: Exactly what a coffee cinnamon beer should look like. Not exactly black, but just dark brown enough, to make it look like there's some cinnamon in there. 
Smell: Says it in the name. A coffee/cinnamon bomb. 
Taste: Same as the aroma, where the coffee/cinnamon comes immediately. Bourbon is there, but not too strong at all. Very smooth.
Feel: Seriously smooth, + syrupy feel. Lingers for a bit, in a great way. 
Overall: Immediately, this became a favorite. Everything this beer advertises in its name, is prominent with every sip. What else can you ask for? A+ 749 charactersHarryS, Jan 13, 2016

Poured into a tulip glass and had a small khaki head.Beer is very coffee forward on the aroma and then you get the cinnamon, other spices and dark fruits. Very faint bourbon on the nose of this beer very very coffee heavy. All the flavors from the nose come together in the taste. Also has a nice chocolate/mocha taste that complements the coffee and cinnamon. The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer. Only complain I can have on this beer is I wish it had a little more barrel and bourbon taste to it but a great beer non the less. 605 charactersvicinandp, Jan 12, 2016

Color is deep dark brown with a decent sized mocha head.  The aroma ... Holy Starbucks Batman!  it's a coffee bomb!  Wow, the coffee is so strong on the nose that it's hard to pick up other notes - but there is a bit of bourbon and some spices.  Flavor is definitely coffee up front, followed by some dark roasted malt and bourbon with the cinnamon much more noticeable in the finish.  It has good complexity, but the coffee is so overpowering it takes some work to discern the additional flavors.  Mouthfeel is nice - very creamy with a bit of bit from the booze.  Overall, a very good beer, but the coffee could use some time to mellow.  I'm looking forward to tasting this with a little more age. 758 charactersmr-jj, Dec 27, 2015

In addition to the coffee, cinnamon, and bourbon, I get a little coconut in the aroma and the taste.  Unlike most BBA beers, the bourbon here is in the background, not dominating the taste.  I like the balance of flavors in this beer ... so much to taste, but nothing really outshouts the rest of the beer.
On tap at Beer Junction a couple of weeks ago, and reviewed now from notes. 435 charactersVashonGuy, Dec 24, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was a bit skeptical of the combination of bourbon, coffee and cinnamon , but this beer exhibited a beautiful, harmonious and seamless melding of those three components. The body is just perfect, creamy and full, without being the least bit heavy.  The flavor is very big and, paradoxically aggressive, and yet, smooth. The finish is extremely long and satisfying, and the drinkability is surprisingly high, despite the huge flavor. Overall, this was an absolute delight, and was the perfect complement to the season. 518 charactersMeow49, Dec 22, 2015

Love Fremont and their barrel program with normal b-bomb my favorite beer,  but this came up bit short. The coffee is currently too sharp for my taste.

4.26/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.2522oz bomber of the 2014 release purchased at Pilgrim’s in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, last summer. I think it was $17.99. I sent one bottle off to my NBS BIF #2 target and have been sitting on the other one I bought until now.
After letting it warm up for about 10 minutes after opening it, I poured it into a St. Bernardus goblet. It poured a syrupy, viscousy dark brown, with a black-like appearance in the glass and a half-inch or so of mocha colored foam that didn’t hang around for more than a couple of minutes. 
At first the nose was mostly of bourbon barrel “woodsiness” and dark malts. There was a little bit of heat and spice in the background. Oddly, I thought I could get a tiny whiff of something like chili peppers, though I don’t think any were involved in this B-Bomb variation. One thing I didn’t get much of in the nose was coffee.
This tastes like a richer version of the “standard” bba Abominable. Sweet and boozy, it drinks like a dessert, with some spiciness and alcohol heat in the background that stands out a little bit more as things warm.
Thick, creamy and velvety mouthfeel
While I like this (a lot!), it’s clear that much of the coffee and cinnamon have been mellowed out of the taste in the year or so this has been sitting. I’ll have to try a fresh version of this when (if) they become available in Spokane. 1,360 characterswoemad, Dec 01, 2015

Thanks Mike!
Poured a pitch black color with 1-to-2 fingers of fizzy, tan head. Average amount of spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Above average retention. (Sight - 4.00)
Smelled dark cocoa nibs, dark chocolate, boozy, bourbon, chocolate syrup, oaky wood, toffee, crayon, bitter coffee malts, caramel, almost Rolos candy, chocolate raisins, coconut (so maybe Mounds candy) and faint unknown wintry spice late. Just awesome. (Smell - 4.75)
Taste followed the nose nicely. Got dark cocoa, dark chocolate, oaky wood, bourbon, Rolos, coconut, Mounds, Raisinets, coffee malts, milk chocolate, Mexican chocolate and light cinnamon stick. Amazing. (Taste - 4.50)
Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)
This was one of the best beers I’ve ever had. Wow. Just amazing. (Overall - 4.75)

Smell is of fresh roasted coffee, cinnamon, and baker's chocolate. Fairly straightforward, but welcoming. Booze is present in the nose but not overpowering.
Taste is bourbon forward with a kick of espresso. Nice and viscous with a slight burn on the way down. Chocolate notes support the backbone and provide a station for the cinnamon and coffee to jump out from. Very nice.
Mouthfeel has a nice viscosity to it. On the heavier side but nice for the style. The barrel definitely didn't thin this beer out. 632 charactersBigRedDog, Oct 05, 2015

Drunk at room temperature.
Pours a dark brown ale with a decent sized beige head that lowers to a film and ring around the glass.  Just a touch of lacing.
The aroma is cinnamon, coffee, caramel, roasted malts, whiskey and honey.  Nice whiffs.
The taste is great!  First sip gave an instant alcohol/cinnamon burn which lasted quite awhile.  Some really great chocolate flavors, some roastiness but the star here is the cinnamon and whiskey.  Each sip creates a tolerable burn that lingers.  The whiskey is definitely present but I can definitely taste the cinnamon which is a nice, new touch….for me.  
The feel is perfect.  For such a big beer, this is a creamy and full bodied masterpiece.  Pure excellence.
Overall this was an awesome session that I didn’t want to end. All that’s advertised on the bottle shines through loud and clear and makes this a top notch beer to seek out. 929 characterskaseydad, Sep 05, 2015

4.37/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Dark and sudsy in the tall Timmermans goblet. The foam is really a brown color. Delirious aroma of Yukon Jack with Mexican chocolate. Boozy and alcoholic nose. Smooth and silky on the tongue. 
My wife says it tastes like the four "Cs"— chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, and coconut. Wow, so spicy. The barrel flavors are really rich. Lots of sugar, again like the Mexican chocolate. I like that this is not the usual flavored imperial stout— this seems to have more complexity and less sugar than the RIS varieties. 
The cinnamon gets a little close to cloying, but this is just so strong and so full of interesting flavors. A tremendous and deeply flavored brew to sip. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Railroad Market in Burlington. 737 charactersmactrail, Aug 29, 2015

Within 5 minutes though, flavors blended and the barrel aged ale flavors came out. Very good offering from Fremont. I personally enjoyed the regular BA Abominable more, however I think this is more a personal preference. I just prefered it without cinnamon more, though both are great offerings. 349 charactersKevinpitts, Aug 22, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -5.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Excited about this one for sure.  Let's check it out!
A - Dark like a stout.  A little bit of deep ruby or burnt orange around the edges when held up to the light.  The mocha head dissipates very quickly, but leaves a nice film around rim.  Nice lacing.  It almost looks like little bits of cinnamon powder are sitting on top of the beer.
N - This has aroma until next Tuesday.  A metric gigaton of bourbon dominates and I get some subtle coffee, which is the perfect amount, as far as I'm concerned.  I firmly believe that coffee should be a complementary piece, not the focus, and this beer nails it.  One of the best and most complex aromas I've ever experienced.  My mouth is figuratively watering.  Figuratively.
T - Verrry interesting.  Lots of layers, like an onion, or an ogre.  I get a bourbon edge around the entirety of the flavor.  But up front I get a little more coffee than on the aroma, complementing that strong ale/barleywine type maltiness.  The finish is entirely cinnamon, but not too much.  This is a perfectly made beer.  Do I love all the flavors?  No.  But this is a superbly crafted brew.
M - It's almost hard to tell if it's carbonation or cinnamon on the tongue.  I'm gonna have to go mostly cinnamon.  Otherwise, the beer is decadently thick, although I don't get too much coating or frothiness as I would have expected.  Still terrific.
O - A real winner here.  They should make this variant again, for sure.  I enjoyed it at least as much as the original. 1,491 charactersCraftFan5, Aug 11, 2015

S - dark fruits, fruitcake, toffee, caramel, slight cinnamon, cheery, wood, and vanilla
T - Sticky bourbon and dark fruits with rum-like spiciness , bourbon, oak and faint chocolate.
F - Thick and full-bodied. No cloying sweetness and no alcohol presence.
O - Great winter warmer/strong ale, but pretty much no coffee. 375 charactersThrewRedButter, Aug 10, 2015

A bit of cloy from thr bourbon but it works here. 341 charactersHootie159, Aug 03, 2015

Rich malty chocolate, coffee, cinnamon flavor. Cinnamon intensifies as it drinks down but in a very reasonable fashion. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and oily, this is what you want a stout to feel like. Overall an incredible beer that I will be seeking out as well as other variations of this stout. 422 characterscostanzo_mike, Aug 03, 2015

4.99/5  rDev +9.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was, quite simply, the best beer I've ever had.  The base beer, B-Bomb, is truly outstanding on its own, because it combines some of the best notes and qualities of a stout with those of a barley-wine, and then complements them with excellent barrel character.  The coffee and cinnamon in this variant, so expertly proportioned and integrated, deepen and amplify all these gustatory virtues.  They are probably the perfect adjuncts for enhancing the base, unless Fremont decides to add some maple syrup to the equation one day.  One can hope, anyway... 557 charactersEdwardAbbey, Jul 16, 2015

From a bomber into a snifter
Vintage: 2014
Pale, chocolate, roasted, carafa, munich and dark crystal malts
Columbus, willamet and EKG hops
APPEARANCE: A dark pour yields a small, one finger, tan head with decent retention. Fades quickly to a full foam cap. Bistre brown body and no carbonation evident. A swirly wisp and ring remain leaving some falling dots of lacing down the glass. Good looking and rather dark for the style. 
SMELL: Lots of adjuncts here. Piles of cinnamon, coffee, sweet cream, and some barrel notes of bourbon, vanilla, sweet milk chocolate and a bit of roasted notes. Really aromatic and nice stuff. 
TASTE: Cinnamon, coffee and bourbon up front. Lots of flavor, and the adjuncts don't completely overpower the barrel aged base beer. Big finish of barrel, vanilla, milk chocolate, cinnamon, bitter coffee and some oak and roasted flavors. Great stuff.  
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down smooth with a bit of a scratch and finishes mouth-coating. Some good heat and spice lingers. 
OVERALL: This is excellent. Fremont never ceases to impress and this one is certainly impressive to say the least. The base 2014 was great while the addition of a few well-chosen adjuncts just adds another layer of fun. Quality stuff and I'd be thrilled to drink any of the Bourbon Abominable variants at any time. Thanks again for sharing Doops. This was awesome. 1,511 charactersJeffo, Jul 04, 2015

S: Lovely. Dark chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, caramel, maple, bourbon, vanilla, raisin...I could go on and on. Rich, decadent, complex, and endlessly enticing.
T: Even better than the nose, which I didn't think was possible. The interplay of sweetness, spice, and richness is unparalleled. Vanilla and cinnamon are just enormous, but with enough coffee and bourbon to keep things from being overly sweet. The finish is candied whiskey perfection, and lasts seemingly forever. This is one of the most singularly delicious beers I've ever had.
M: Not quite as luxuriously full-bodied as the flavor deserves, but a solid and well-carbonated mouthfeel all the same.
O: Wow.
Cheers! 763 characterswoosterbill, Jun 30, 2015

4.51/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance:  Pours fudge brown, with a modest mocha head that fades quickly to a ringlet; quite a few dots and dashes of lace
Smell:  The coffee and cinnamon both come through in the aroma, with Bourbon, caramel, vanilla, coconut, milk chocolate and leather; German chocolate cake and Samoas come to mind
Taste:  Cinnamon, caramel, vanilla and Bourbon with brown sugar and coconut tones developing; in the middle, the milk chocolate and coffee start to add depth, with leather and oak tones adding complexity; some booziness in the finish and the cinnamon adds some heat to the aftertaste
Mouthfeel:  Full bodied with low to moderate carbonation
Overall:  I don't often get to taste Fremont beers so I was excited to give this a try; while I found the 2013 version of the base beer a bit too boozy and sweet (though I had it in Feb 2014 so perhaps it didn't have time to coalesce), this is incredible, with the Bourbon adding just the right amount of flavor; the cinnamon and coffee add a lot, as well; (thanks to BA draheim for the Samoas reference - that's my favorite Girl Scout cookie and I get those flavors in this beer)

4.87/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours  a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass; could be a stout from the appearance. Fine half finger light brown head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon and coffee, mouth watering. Flavor follows, a nicely integrated combination of dark malt, molasses, oaky vanilla, bourbon and black coffee. Finishes with spicy vanilla coffee infused sweet dark malt. Medium to heavy bodied with creamy mouth feel. I'm impressed by the balance in this ale. The bourbon is forward, but not overpowering, and the coffee, spices and oak infuences are also nicely balanced. Surprisingly clear vanilla notes that might have been too strong, except they meld with the bourbon very nicely. I really loved the regular barrel aged abominable and the coffee adds nice, interesting new flavor notes. 905 charactersLiquidAmber, Jun 02, 2015

The base beer is perfectly highlighted by the barrel.  Flavors are balanced.  Not overly sweet.  The mouthfeel is perfect for a big winter warmer bordering on english barleywine.  The cinnamon really shines and toes the line of spicy.  Hints of coffee accentuate the base beer and highlight the brightness in the cinnamon.  Really complex and really outstanding. 437 charactersPHBoiler, Apr 23, 2015

This thing is a damn near perfect balance of spice, coffee, bourbon, cinnamon, and malt.  I love the amount of balance taking place.  From the nose to the palate, everything just seems to blend so well.  Adjuncts can be tricky to work with and overpowering at times, but Fremont makes it look flawless here.  The body comes off as a little thin at times, but I have to remind myself that this isn't an imperial stout.  Goes down so easy.  Masterfully done.  Probably should have tried the reg B-Bomb first, but I just couldn't wait on this one.  Looking forward to more Fremont. 595 charactersBosoxfan20, Apr 12, 2015

4.55/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from 22oz waxed bomber into my Fremont globe.  This is the 2014 edition.
Appearance:  totally black with a finger of rich light-brown foam atop.  Quite amazing.
Smell:  richly malty aroma with a big dose of coffee which is still very balanced; the cinnamon floats along on top and adds a layer of complexity which is surprising and welcome.  I would think the coffee and cinnamon would fight each other, but no -- the confluence is amazing.
Taste:  coffee right up front, which is just a little surprising.  This slowly gives way to rich strong-ale maltiness, followed by a little sweet booziness and just a dash of cinnamon that is, again, entirely bizarre but welcome.  A-frickin'-mazing.
Mouthfeel:  rich body with a good carbonation.  It's not exactly creamy, because the bubbles are so small that a very silky smoothness is engendered instead.  Wonderful.
Overall:  I believe this beer deserves all the accolades it gets.  It is a little bourboney/boozy, but this is balanced by the amazingly deft yet unsubtle hand of the coffee and cinnamon.  Yumyumyum. 1,072 charactersflagmantho, Apr 10, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25From a bomber into an oversized snifter.
Great fluffy, mocha or dark khaki-colored head with that chewy look, extensive lacing and good persistence. Pitch black body as I would have expected. Seeing the lace develop and the head remain has a certain visual appeal. Great looking beer. 5
Strong bourbon aroma and light cinnamon and the accompanying woodiness. Light notes of chocolate and vanilla. It all smells nice but it seems the boozy bourbon notes kind of stifle everything else. 4
Cinnamon and dated coffee (to be expected given the number of months since this was released) blend with bourbon spice and notes of oak and vanilla. The cinnamon becomes more pronounced with some warmth so drinking a bomber here is warranted (as it always is, playa!). 4.25
Even with a few months, this beer is a bit, maybe not hot, but solvent-like. Due to this, the mouthfeel is a bit lighter than medium as it takes on a hard alcohol feel. It's not thin either, just somewhere in between light like heavy booze and a medium-bodied stout. 
4
Great cinnamon and coffee flavor emerges but I think far too many folks love the big bourbon flavors in these beers where I find them overpowering and overshadowing the other elements. Some of y'all might need just take up bourbon. Having said that, this beer is very enjoyable, let me make that clear. 1,338 charactersONovoMexicano, Apr 08, 2015

A- Dark brown body, opaque. Looks like black coffee, half finger white head, good retention time, no lacing or film left over.
S- Straight up coffee. There is a bit of milk chocolate, oak and bourbon, but make no mistake this has a strong coffee aroma. Minimal cinnamon, but...
F- This beer has so much cinnamon, it's ridiculous. Milk chocolate, cocoa, molasses, oak, espresso. Very nice and complex despite being dominated by the cinnamon.
M- Medium-thick bodied, easy to drink, none of the 11% ABV heat. Finish is plenty of cinnamon mixed in with a bit of molasses sweetness.
O- Outstanding beer that displays completely different profiles on the smell versus the taste. Intense in two different ways. Definitely recommend. 781 charactersStevedore, Mar 31, 2015

A – Pours a nice, dark brown. Head is cappuccino colored and thin, but does leave behind spotty, clinging lacing.
S – Extremely sweet notes of cinnamon, sugar, candied caramel corn, very light coffee notes.
T – Sugary, syrupy, cloying sweetness. Strong notes of sweetened caramel coffee. Notes of toasted coconut here as well.
M – Clingy and sweet, long, lingering finish of sweet sugars and coconuts.
O – Not what I had expected, this was almost artificially sweet, with very limited "spice" notes, big brown sugar and toasted coconut and chocolate notes here. 591 charactersMoose90, Mar 26, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.75650ml bottle poured into a Fremont Brewing snifter glass.
The beer pours a nearly jet black color, cola brown edges, light beige head about a finger or two high, moderate retention yielding a few spots of soapy lace. The aroma is lovely, plenty of barrel, bourbon, oak, toffee, leather, lightly roasted coffee, sweet and zesty cinnamon, stone fruits with chocolate that lingers well, super complex and delicate, so inviting and intriguing. The flavors are wonderful, huge cinnamon burst leads the way, mild coffee, light roast and charred profile with some fruit that plays well with the stone fruit character, loads of chocolate, chewy oak barrel, smooth bourbon and toffee, leather, tobacco, spice, heavy grain at the finish. The balance is superb and the complexity is fantastic but what I really appreciate is how much of the base beer I can still pick up, the adjuncts really shine, but don't define this. The mouthfeel is nice, lively body, smooth texture, coats the mouth well, more carbonation than I expected that finishes easily with a lightly warming sensation. 
Verdict: A really spectacular beer from Fremont, so explosive and flavorful. The cinnamon really does the trick here, but the coffee isn't to be forgotten, it might not be as prolific on the tongue, but it helps to bind the beer together really well. This was truly a masterful beer one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying, cheers Fremont. 1,431 characterskevanb, Mar 03, 2015

Appearance - Big khaki head.  Good retention.  Thick chunky collar.
Smell - Cinnamon and bourbon.  Some coffee, but not too strong. Mostly cinnamon.
Taste - Lots of cinnamon again.  Coffee.  Caramel and some chocolate.  Then more cinnamon.  Sweet finish.
Mouthfeel - Well carbonated.  Medium body.  Kinda boozy.
Overall - This is good, but I'm not buying the hype.  The cinnamon masks a lot of the qualities of the base beer. 467 charactersAlieniloquium, Mar 03, 2015

Smells of heavy cinnamon and touch of coffee, notes of brown sugar and oak as it warms.  Taste was quite complex with a burst of cinnamon followed by molasses, vanilla, raisins, chocolate covered cherries, and hint of roast coffee.  Good weight in the mouth, really coating the tongue.   I really enjoyed this beer.  The cinnamon starts off overpowering, but fades and integrates better as it warms.  I think this is an outstanding beer, but I enjoyed the standard B-Bomb a bit more. 565 charactersOneEye78, Feb 28, 2015

The beer hits of wonderful bourbon quality, sweet toffee and caramel, dark fruit, but also even a stout quality. The cinnamon hits in the front, as coffee checks in on the back.
The cinnamon is slightly intense, but the base beer does not fail. 298 charactersdar482, Feb 24, 2015

Aroma is big chocolate, coffee and spice. Earthy, nutty, roasty. Caramel, bourbon, rich pipe tobacco, leather.
Taste follows nose. Rich and complex. Chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, dark fruit, bourbon. A hint of toasted coconut, like those Samoas cookies. Both sweet and bitter, even savory. Tons of complexity here, while staying perfectly balanced.
Mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Not at all thick or chewy, just right. Really outstanding.
Overall just really a great beer in every way. One of my favorite Fremont beers ever, and perhaps also one of the best beers I've ever had. 658 charactersdraheim, Feb 11, 2015

4.61/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Right off the bat we get a beautiful black body. The medium brown head starts off decently large before settling into a much finer dusting across the top. 
As soon as you start pouring, that bourbon soaked goodness escapes and wends its way through your nostrils. Sweet and roasted dark notes step forth as well, and the coffee bitter is present as well. Though I didn't pick it up initially, I do definitely catch a faint whiff of hot sweet cinnamon at times as well. Pretty damn excited for this guy.
...And it does not disappoint. Starts out with a round sweet note. Alcohol is present from the git go. Bourbon soaked cocoa nibs and coconut. The coconut is actually pretty prevalent and surprises me a little bit for some reason. It's good though. Roasty and the coconut meets some chocolate and some coffee (but not that super-acrid mechanics-lobby coffee that seems to be de rigeur in brewing [to add bitterness. I get it, and for the most part love it], this is definitely a softer and more fully realized coffee: like that expensive-ass hand roasted stuff that talks about 'notes of hazelnut and blackberry, blah blah blah [yes I get the irony of teasing coffee *ahem* advocates]) and molasses. Vanilla. Lots of things that are mainly all pretty great. I love baking (I may have mentioned this before), and while this doesn't have the full on bakers-delight I've seen in other brews, there's enough subtle nods in that direction to evoke the imagery. The cinnamon contributes to this. as does the molasses. Though that descriptor makes it sound like they dominate. This brew is just an incredibly complex, amazingly delicious and impressively balanced concoction. .
The pour made this appear thick as thick does, but, while not thin by any means, it tends towards the medium side of medium rare, if you catch my drift. Goes the route of the tiny bubbly carbonation, and it helps deflect from the booziness a bit. This isn't a fireball-type, but I'm not exactly surprised to look at the label and see the numbering: 11%. 
Bottom line: This is a fantastic beer. One I'm proud to know comes from my city. I haven't had the base B-Bomb in a hot minute, so I can't really offer meaningful insights to compare and contrast it to the cinnamon/coffee variation (no, I'm not cracking into the bottles I've got stored away for a beautiful rainy day some years from now just for comparisons sake. At least not today!). If you've ever got the opportunity to drink this (or any of the variants, or the base bomb, or even the base Abominable, really for that matter) do it. Do not think twice. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200 (wait, no, if you have the opportunity to snag a couple hundo on the way to drinking this, definitely do that. And then use it to buy more of this!). 2,774 characterskemoarps, Feb 01, 2015

4.65/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75For me, the original version has always been too sweet.  This version has a better balance and gives you a good hit of cinnamon and coffee.  The beer looks great, super dark brown.  Dense mocha head.  The aromas are of cinnamon, deep roasted malts, barrel, and coffee.  The taste is, of course, a nice mix of cinnamon, vanilla, stout, barrel, then coffee.  In that order.  The feel fits well and rounds everything out, into a world-class offering.
Overall, this is a couple of steps above the original version.  I really enjoy the unique cinnamon flavor.  This is highly recommended. 584 charactersmabermud, Jan 22, 2015
4.75/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a very opaque dark brown. Nearly black. Half a finger of light brown head. Sticks to the glass some. Smell initially was straight used coffee grounds. That subsided to make room for some roasted malt, faint cinnamon/nutmeg, a touch of alcohol. Mild oak tannins and some baker's chocolate, too. Flavor is sweet chocolate, some mild roast/coffee, hint of some sweet fruit (cherry?), and a tinge of alcohol. Really nice beer. Mouthfeel is a nice medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. One of the better "winter" beers out there. 531 charactersjbwimer, Jan 22, 2015

Aged beer. The coffee and cinnamon are gentle enough to add flavor but does not take away from the barrel and the base stout which are both delicious. A little boozy, but this is the newest batch. Wow this is delicious, trade for this. 258 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 19, 2015

This is actually a trend I can live with ...hopefully making everyone forget about all those god forsaken session beers. High hopes as I crack that fancy gold wax.
Appearance. Pours a deep dark brown that's not quite black in the glass, but pretty darn close. Topped with close to half a finger of  light brown head that fades to a collar pretty quick.
Smell. Toffee, toasted oak, cinnamon, some coffee, and a little molasses and coconut. There's some subtle phenolic fruitiness as well.  Fairly sweet smelling with quite a bit going on. 
Taste. Toffee and woody cinnamon, coffee, vanilla and sweet, smooth woody bourbon, chocolate, a touch of molasses, a touch of dark fruit. Again, lots going on. Fairly sweet but not over the top.
Mouthfeel. Full body, just a touch sticky on the lips. Low+ carbonation.
Overall. Very good, a nice twist on b-bomb. I would probably take this over regular b-bomb but it's only because I'm so hip with the trends. 1,055 charactersRutager, Jan 10, 2015

Damn, this was a fine, tasty beer.  The coffee flavor is intense, and tended to dominate the flavor profile.  The cinnamon chimed in as well and added a nice flavor element as well, with the bourbon barrel flavor seeming  to keep everything together and in harmony.
As is typical, there were a lot of fantastic beers at the share, but this beer more than held its own.  Impressive. (very happy to find a couple more bottles during a recent trip to Tacoma, as this beer, and the regular version, are the real deal).
Edit from 12/28/14.  Had this beer on tap at the Red Hot, and immediately realized I needed to increase my original score.  On tap at the RH, and with some time to sit and contemplate this beer, it was apparent just what a great beer this is.  The coffee and cinnamon seemed to blend in seamlessly with the base beer and the bourbon, giving the beer a wonderful coffee caramel, toffee nougat and milk dud flavor profile.  To no great surprise, this beer was incredibly popular at the Red Hot.  Even at $10 for an 11.5 ounce pour, they blew through their keg in less than a day.  This is just delicious stuff. 1,206 charactersJohn_M, Dec 14, 2014
