4.16/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a quickly dissipating finger’s worth of white foamy head that left some sly sticky lacing. The aroma starts off with sweet to bitter danky hop oils moving slowly over some grape juice (sharp yet sweet, sly bitter). Danky sweet onion, super subtle pine. Tropical fruity juice. The flavor leans to the sweet danky onion side allowing the hop oils to create a slick sweet free flowing juicy to hop oily aftertaste riding on into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a nice sipping quality about it. Moderate carbonation with a sly stickiness about it nuanced by some sharp to semi-oily yet slick feel, now that’s quite different for a DIPA. I’m guessing the sauvignon blanc grape juice flowing all about, is that what is doing it? Me, I’m not sure. Overall, a fabulous DIPA that really "dials in" well in the aroma and flavor with a different sort of feel enacting itself on my tongue. Of course, I would have this again, and can understand why a fair amount of people aren’t going to like this. Those grapes change up the "feel" on the tongue, so be ready for it. 1,186 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 05, 2017

4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.516 oz can poured into a teku glass. Canned on 3/5/2017. Dialed In is a rotating series of double IPAs that have wine grape juice added while the beer is in mid-fermentation. This one features the sauvignon blanc grape, a white varietal that is known for being bone dry with earthy or grassy notes and is a very popular varietal from the Marlborough region of New Zealand. The folks at Trillium thankfully dry-hopped Dialed In with the New Zealand hop Nelson Sauvin to complement the earthy but crisp fruit notes of sauvignon blanc. Other ingredients include Pilsner malts, flaked wheat, and Galaxy hops.
L - hazy amber color, cloudy hue, low carbonation, barely a finger of head, no lacing
S - Nelson Sauvin heaven. The aroma sitting still is all hops but when swished around you can get this mineral character from the grapes. 
T - Peach, mango, pineapple, pine resin on the finish. Very much beer and not wine. 
F - This is pretty crazy stuff. The flaked wheat and dextrine already bumps up the mouthfeel along with the acidity of the grapes. Definitely some hop resin and dry mineral on the finish
O - This is a very good beer with everything that is going on. Personaly, I think they could do without the dextrin malt to ease up on the mouthfeel and allow the grapes to come through a bit more. Overaly an awesome creation and consider yourself lucky if you get your hands on this. Cheers! 1,398 charactersctylinebeer, May 24, 2017

A: Hazy yellow, with just a bit of visible carbonation and a half-finger's worth of white head.
S: Dank and melon and tropical fruits. A citrus whip with wheat and cracker malts. Some apricot and cantaloupe, dank and grassy. No "grape juice" on the nose...but this smells really good.
T:  Melon, dank, and juicy tangerines. More apricot and tropical fruits – mango and papaya. Light malts, again with a touch of wheat grist, but not in a negative husky way. Then some dry, white vinous aspect – it’s not huge but it’s there. It finishes with more juicy melon and citrus that are only moderately bitter, and some dryness from the “white wine” flavors.
M: An average body compared to the other few "New England" IPAs that I’ve had. Good carbonation sensation, and the alcohol flavors are nicely integrated.
O: Really tasty, as have been the rest of Trillium's beers I’ve had. A really good DIPA – juicy, fruity, and the dry vinous is a nice touch. 1,116 charactersmacrosmatic, May 20, 2017

4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75It's been a long time since I've bothered to review a beer but this one was worth it. Just phenomenal. Drank six cans over the course of a couple months since its release and the evolution over that time has been fascinating. From its early days as an ultra dank and bitter, highly aromatic fruit bomb to its current state that has lost some of its crazy hop freshness for a deeply integrated grape character. The complexity is stunning. Fresh stone fruit characters and melon are in play with a touch of mustiness. 
That doesn't really do this beer justice, it dances successfully on that precipice of gimmick, and comes out utterly unique. I've had a few outstanding wine/beer hybrids but this is the first in the IPA style and easily one of my favorite new beers in years. 776 characterserrantnight, May 05, 2017

Imperial in its status, the hops of Nelson Sauvin for a tangy, wine-like zing and then layered with grape juice for a taste to appease both sides of the drinking aisle.
Pouring with the haze of tapioca, the tannish sepia stain takes on the look of straight up vegemite. But its scent tingles the nose with tropical, vinous and citrus fruits swirling with fresh herbs and a kiss of cannabis. Honey, fresh kilned grain and light poundcake splash the tongue with mild malt sweetness.
But on the middle palate, the sweetness begins to dissolve and the hops and grape charge in. Tangy lime, orange and lemon peel, mango, passionfruit and kiwi come from the tropical side while white wine, green apple, tart spiciness stem from its wine influence. But trailing with fresh grass clippings, geranium and another swirl of hemp and the bitter stage is all set.
Medium bodied but seeming fuller up front and drier to trail, the beer's tart and bitter interplay is something of a herbaceous creamsicle along with a grassy astringency that plays nicey behind the grape juicy and hops. A long and bitter aftertaste leaves lasting impressions of citrus peel and tart wine. 1,284 charactersBEERchitect, Apr 07, 2017

Head formation is slim, only foaming up to a finger in height, and recedes into the beer almost as quickly as it forms. No lacing left behind. Aroma is loaded with citrus notes - orange, tangerine, and mango - right from the start. There is an underlying note of grapes as well. Flavor profile is teeming with citrus notes: orange, tangerine, mango, lemon zest, and papaya. Biscuit malts and raw grain provide a tether for the hops to balance them out. Grapes mingle around the citrus and malts to add another layer to the flavor dynamics. Mouth feel is very much juice-like, with a consistency something like a regular grape juice. That is to say: smooth, and medium-thin with just a touch of grain. Overall, a flavorful DIPA that has quite a lot going on. The hops are plentiful and flavorful, and refrain from any bitterness.

A: Creamy light orange color, quite hazy with no light getting through except around the edges, with a finger of off white head.  Decent enough retention but minimal lacing.
S: Orange and vanilla, tropical notes a la a Sauvignon Blanc (smells like they blended in the wine, which I guess they basically did), a bit of lemon and hay.
T: Follows the nose closely with orange creamsicle, tropical fruit, lightly floral, finishing with a mild to moderate, slightly harsh and lingering bitterness.  
M: Medium-full bodied, round, creamy, a bit “gritty”, with medium carbonation.
O: Lots of flavor with bitterness on the somewhat milder side makes this pretty drinkable and, at 8.5%, pretty dangerous.  The bitterness is a bit harsh, though.  The grape juice addition is big enough to be noticeable and complements the base fairly well. 881 characterspmarlowe, Mar 21, 2017

4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Canned 03/09/17, it pours cloudy gold color with the typical New England DIPA looks, which leads up to a 1 finger foamy white head that stuck around for almost a minute and then just went down and dissipated quickly, leaving good spotty lacing. Looks like fruit juice in the best way possible.
Smells like just cutting open a red grapefruit or an orange, then getting a blast of lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, white grapes, melon, passion fruit, piney hops and then biscuit, white wine, peppery spices and earthy notes. Really complex with just enough malt to balance it yet let the juicy citrus hops and sauvignon blanc juice really shine. A unique twist on an great base DIPA
Taste like the nose starts off like grapefruit and orange juice mixed together, starting bitter and full of citrus notes. It then shifts to some caramel, graham cracker and biscuit before the rest of the citrus kicks in with lemon zest, tangerine,  white grapes, pineapple and tropical fruit. The third act includes dank piney hops, white wine, peppery spices and earthy notes. The sauvignon blanc lingers with the citrus hop bitterness and changes the dynamic from typical IPA to almost a sour style quality. It's a lot to take in all at once, but I like the way everything works together. Very tasty indeed.
Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body that leans towards thick, nice texture, sharp bitterness and light carbonation that trails off with a lot of citrus and tropical fruit. The flavors mask the ABV perfectly and the bitterness adds to the overall experience, letting the hoppy complexities integrate well with the sauvignon blanc juice. Really well done and I'm happy this can is so fresh at only a week old, it was damn enjoyable. 1,727 charactersCHickman, Mar 19, 2017

Pours a vibrant gold-orange color that is very opaque.  Stupendous color IMO, and I don't find myself saying that often.  Very thin head - just a film really but nice retention on the glass for what it has.  So it is a tiny knock off an otherwise perfect look.  I hold it up as proudly as I did my son when he was born  :)
Smells of tropical fruit behind a bright citrus and grape up-front aroma.  Maybe a bit of grassiness, but this is a very fresh batch so I'm unsure if that is common as it ages.
Taste is refreshing - full of hop-forward flavor mixed with a slight white wine tinge.  It does work well I have to say, speaking as an initial doubter.  Unlike so many of their other street series, this flavor is really not tropical/sweet.  It has a more lemony citrus freshness to it - I think that can be attributed more to the Nelson hops.  Bitterness is moderate - possibly added to by the grape juice - and there is no sweet backbone you typically find with NE IPAs...  well, maybe a hint but that's all. 
In contrast to other commentators I do NOT find this to be a boozy DIPA at all.  It is really refreshing like lemonade in the summer heat.
Feel is a tad creamy and clean in the mouth with little stickiness.  Effervescence is strong in this one - each sip is like a mild seltzer in the background.  I happen to think that is a good thing here.
overall this is a departure from the sweeter IPAs from Trillium, and done well.  The grape juice is subtle enough to blend graciously with the hop flavors.  Perhaps not ironically the term "dialed in" comes to mind because they appear to have fine tuned the ratios well.  It may not be the first beer from Trillium I reach for but damn, they did this well for the style! 1,769 charactersdigboy, Mar 17, 2017

3.81/5  rDev -15%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.7516oz can, purchased from from the brewery, poured into a Trillium Congress Street becher pint glass. Enjoyed on 12.27.2016, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a cloudy and hazy golden peach color, orange hues with a thin finger of foamy white head, hardly any retention nor lace. The aroma is nice, lots of citrus, white wine grape, very floral and bright, tropical fruit and plenty of sweetness, yeasty and malty. The flavors are good, really juicy and tropical, lots and lots of hops, white wine grape at the start with a strong herbal and floral, definitely a lot of Nelson hop presence, citrusy and fruity with some bready malts, sweet and yeasty with some mineral water. The mouthfeel is okay, very active texture, bubbly and lively, coating with a medium body and a lightly boozy finish that is quite dry.
Verdict: A nice DIPA from Trillium, very herbal and earthy but with some nice tropical notes. Definitely a bit boozy at the finish and for my tastes, has that herbal/green overhopped flavor that is so common in Trillium beer. That being said, it's very easy to enjoy a can of this beer. 1,111 characterskevanb, Jan 23, 2017

Smell:  Citrusy grapefruit aromas dominate with  grassy, herbal notes underneath;  white wine, pineapple and mango in the mix, as well 
Taste:  Opens with tropical fruit and citrus tones; white wine grape flavors develop, through the middle; after the swallow, herbal, earthy, floral notes arrive, bringing a moderately bitter finish
Mouthfeel:  Medium body with moderate carbonation. 
Overall:  A really interesting experiment that works well and is impressive in its unusual character;  nicely balanced between the wine / hop elements 671 charactersbrentk56, Jan 15, 2017

Appear: pours a beautiful light golden haze with about a fingers worth of head nice varied size bubbles.  lasted about 60-90 seconds.  
Smell: HOLY white wine grape juice.  like minerally Sauv Blanc notes alot of grassy notes.  bright lemon and lime citrus (and thats just on first pour).  I keep interrupting my appear writing to come back to this nose.  Unbelievable.  the bright notes. on deeper whiff you definitely get more of the mineral like granite notes from the wine grapes.  There's definitely some tannic notes very much like a Sauv Blanc.  This is easily one of the best smelling beers Ive ever had.  It's literally perfect. 
Taste: just an absolute Juice bomb.   Flavor follows the nose. getting the bright lemon lime citrus notes. also a nice herbal dankness in there.  The mineral notes I was getting on the nose aren't present on taste but there is still some tannic notes coming through. Fantastic. 
Mouth:  creamy nice medium body.  THe carbonation is nice.  THe 8.5% is well balanced.  very smooth
Over:  Incredible brew.  I really don't know what to say.  I'm just sad I only got one in a recent trade.  Do what you must to try this beer. 1,237 charactersGumbo_gravy, Jan 04, 2017

Pours cloudy light gold with a short-lived head and minor lacing. Aromatics lead off with tropical fruit and grape must. Mango, pineapple, grape jam, and orange marmalade. Medium bodied with a tacky, resinous mouthfeel. Ripe citrus on the palate with underlying grape notes. Candied grapefruit, fruit cocktail syrup, and a mildly funky vinous hint. Finishes a bit sweet with zero malt, low bitterness and some lingering honey. 
Quite a beer. The Sauvignon Blanc Juice adds quite a depth of flavor but also a bit of sweetness. 551 charactersbrewandbbq, Dec 22, 2016

Palate Contaminants: other beer
Back to Trillium to see what else they have.
Appearance is hazy and straw colored. Hardly any head.
The smell is pineapple, grape leaf, and pine needles. Judging by the scent, it might go fairly well with salty cheese or Italian food. But what matters is...
It's basically the same for the taste, but there's some savoriness that really comes out. It's slightly buttery, as well. And flint. I'm having to resort to my wine vocabulary for this one, but it's certainly a beer. You know what? While I'm at it, I'll give credit for dried peat, too. Presumably, the acidity is lower than for the wine, but it is discernible. I think it would probably go well with any Mediterranean food, not just Italian.
It has a light medium feel with fine-medium carbonation. The aftertaste evokes grape leaves and salty cheese, even though it's not a salty beverage. 904 charactersZythophile, Dec 17, 2016

Aroma is Nelson, grape juice, wine with light biscuit in background. 
Taste is a beer/wine blend.  Nelson hops shine through,  get a little oaky taste on back end.  Finished very dry like s wine. 
Mouthfeel-  solid and appropriate for style 
Overall-while I enjoyed this beer as a nice change, this is not a bad I consume mass quantities of.  I prefer my iPas more sweet, dank, fruity and piney.  Very glad I tried it but prefer the other trillium offerings I have had 550 charactersjcflorian, Dec 16, 2016

4.81/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The Dialed In series is amazing.  Pours hazy, caution light yellow in color with one inch head.  Taste is peach, light tangerine, and big Sauvignon Blanc grape.  Light bodied, slightly bitter and high carbonation.  So incredibly smooth.  Love the way Trillium integrates wine with ipas.  Trillium does a lot of amazing things, but this may be the thing they do the best.  If you like wine or not, this is an amazing beer.  Seek this out. 437 characterstigg924, Dec 11, 2016

Smelll: peach, Margo, tropical hops
Taste: Starts tropical hop sweet, then resiny and bitter, and finally finishes with a strange alcohol sweetness
Feel: nice full soft mouthfeel
Overall: Tastes very tropical, not complex, and I do not like the sweet alcohol finish. 343 characterslic217, Nov 22, 2016

For those of you who don't know the neighborhood, Trillium's neighbors are one of the best oyster producers and seafood restaurants in Boston (Row 34), and I expect the motivation for this beer came from seafood pairing.
Cloudy liquid, soapy head, glorious mouth feel and tight sweet tangy finish. 354 charactersryanbhale, Oct 01, 2016

Look: Cloudy, light golden orange color.  Thick and foamy big bubbled head.  Lacing sticks on side of the glass.
Smell: Smells juicy, I hate using that word, but it does.  The juice is citrus and white grape.  Can definitely tell there is a sauvignon blanc juice addition .
Taste: Very tasty, the grape juice is a great addition, adds to the hop profile, stays clean, crisp and refreshing.
Feel: Moderate level of carbonation, medium body. Crisp, clean, not cloying or syrupy.
Overall: A really good brew.  Nice change of pace with the added wine grape juice, very balanced and clean. 624 charactersjhavs, Apr 20, 2016

Color is the typical orangish yellow you;d come to expect from ta Trillium IPA. Smell coming off of it gives me mango and other tropical fruits with a little hint of the Sauvignon Blanc grapes coming through a bit. Taste is excellent, not the same juice bomb I'm used to with other Trillum brews, but the Sauvignon Blanc juice really comes through and the mouth feel is wonderful. Really glad I was able to try this one. 465 charactersmanbearpack, Apr 16, 2016

S - Bright tropical fruit aroma up front with a light grape presence and a slight honey malt sweetness.
T - Huge tropical fruit flavours of mango, pineapple and tangerine up front.  The sav blac juice enters mid-palate adding a big grape presence and the advertised wine-like character, which lingers in the finish.  A touch of honey malt sweetness is complimented by the sweetness from the grapes.
M - Medium body, oily.  Light carbonation. 548 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Apr 15, 2016

4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Trillium snifter. Thanks Steve for picking this up for me. Bottle date is 3/16/16, first batch. 
Pours a characteristically hazy body but is a little lighter from the typical Trillium IPA, golden straw yellow with a one finger white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave very little lacing and a ring of retention.
Aromas of citrus and grapefruit dominate with some grassy, herbal notes in there as well. Tropical fruits mingled into the aroma, pineapple and mango, with white wine in the distance. 
Taste starts with light tropical fruit, followed by some citrus mixed in with a unique grapey, dry white wine flavor. The follow through is lightly boozy with herbal, earthy, floral notes and a moderately bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium and pretty easy to drink with medium-high carbonation. 
An interesting, unique choice of ingredients and I commend Trillium for experimenting. They really "dialed-in" the wine / hop balance here. 977 charactersgcamparone, Apr 14, 2016

Pours yellow/gold, hazy with a strong citrus aroma. I'm definitely getting some grape juice flavor, which is balanced nicely by orange/pineapple. A real smooth drinker, not too bitter. Relatively thin mouthfeel, especially when compared to other DIPAs. Man, I'm drinking this fast!
Wasn't sure I would like this due to the presence of Sauvignon Blanc. But it adds to the typical Trillium juicy flavor nicely.
Like every other Trillium brew I've tried, highly recommended! 558 charactersCeltics76, Apr 10, 2016

O: Among Trillium's myriad IPA offerings, Dialed In makes a unique statement. This drinks so smoothly and provides a very distinctive interplay between a tropical IPA and fruity white wine. I can understand why some IPA-purists may not love this one, but I thoroughly enjoyed the creativity and delicious twist afforded by this beer. In my opinion, Dialed-in is an excellent addition to Trillium's deep bench of expertly crafted hoppy brews. 741 charactersFireman_RK, Apr 04, 2016

Look: Very hazy, pineapple color like all other Trillium IPA's; wouldn't want it any other way. The head retention on this beer is a bit better than most of their other beers. A nice lacing is left behind. 
Smell: Dankness up front with a ton of peach, mango, and a bit of orange. Not a whole lot going on in the nose, to be honest. 
Taste: A huge punch of peach and mango up front. The orange and lemon show up shortly after, ending in a slight caramel, vanilla, and residual dankness. 
Feel: Feels odd to me. Part of me could drink this all day and part of me just wants to drink 8 ounces of this. It's thin at moments, and full at others. It's pretty average bodied for a double IPA. It definitely has the signature Trillium mouthfeel to it though. 
Overall: I quite enjoy this one. One I would certainly buy again but not one I would buy multiples of. This is probably my least favorite of the Trillium beers I've bought and had so far. It has nothing on the DDH Fort Point.... 1,038 charactersTHSmusicman, Apr 04, 2016

Coarse egg shell that quickly dissipated - similar to a sour saison (kind of unique). The smell was very juicy. The taste knocked my socks off, I mean wow. Citrusy and juicy and soo smooth. I find most NE hazey hops to be much less smooth, kind of sits on stomach. The grape juice did not necessarily stand out, but melded with the hop profile and provided the world class feel. I was very over impressed. Trilliums game is on POINT!

This one pours a very hazy pineapple juice sort of orange, with a one inch head, and lots of lacing.
Smells like orange, white grape, grapefruit, melon, and a bit of pine, with some slight vinous aromas as well.
This is classic Trillium, one of their usual bangers. The addition of Sauvignon Blanc juice is surprisingly not overwhelming. It's blends in well, and just makes it feel like the Nelson is even more amplified. There's lots of grape, orange, mango, and grapefruit rind, with a light clean bitterness on the finish. This works more than I thought it would.
This is medium bodied, pretty thick and creamy like most Trillium IPAs, with a normal level of carbonation.
This is really the correct name for the beer- Trillium is so dialed in right now and producing the bestest of beers. 839 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 02, 2016

Aroma is pleasant but subdued, white wine notes with a touch of tropical fruit. Taste is subdued as well, there are moderate white wine notes and some juicy tropical fruits, namely mango, but the flavor is quite subdued. Good mouthfeel medium-ish body and moderate carbonation, pretty typical of Trillium beers. Overall, I'm underwhelmed, it's not a bad beer by any stretch but I just found all the flavors very muted.

Served in a snifter
Turbid, pale straw yellow appearance. The beer was topped by a finger tall crop of bright white froth that quickly dropped to a thin halo. Minimal lacing.
Absolutely mesmerizing aroma. Nelson hops dominated. The winey, grapeyness was off the charts. Loads of grape must. Sauvignon Blanc notes came through big time. Crisp and fruity. Slightly lemony. Tropical fruits were also noticeable. Passionfruit was most apparent. Hint of mango too.
The flavor profile was impressive but definitely more crisp and dry than the nose. While the nose was all Nelson hops, the flavor definitely had more Galaxy hop character. Loads of white grapefruit. Quite lemony and tart as well. Fairly pithy and dry. Very crisp and white wine-like. Some mango was noticeable. Grapefruit rind came through strong on the back end and in the finish. More dryness and just a touch of bitterness.
The mouthfeel was soft and lighter bodied. Somewhat thin considering the ABV. The liquid contained a crisp, bubbly, sprightly effervescence that frothed up nicely on the palate.
Trillium's third anniversary release is yet another amazing hoppy beer from Boston's hoppy beer gurus. Southern Hemisphere hops are becoming more and more popular, and Dialed In showcases these varietals better than perhaps anything I have ever tried. If you like super crisp, winey, Nelson and Galaxy hop forward beers, then you will love this one. 1,518 charactersDamian, Apr 02, 2016

I recall being floored by the nose as the smell of grapes, tropical fruit waft across the pizzeria patio. Having the standard dirty hazy look that all of NE falls over trying to do, the feel of the brew was of low carb, however, the taste shined forth as the addition of the juice mid fermentation gave it the taste of a vinous IPA. 351 charactersAbbbp, Apr 01, 2016

Pours a hazy medium creamy straw yellow body, two finger white head, appropriate retention and plenty of lacing. As expected for a Trillium beer. Smells of grape must, grapefruit, citrus, some zest, a little bit of spice, a bit sweeter than other Trillium due to the grape juice. It's really quite nice, a bit heavier and sweeter than typical. Flavour is a heavy grapefruit presence, a fair bit of grape sweetness that nicely complements the grapefruit, a bit of lemon, spices, floral notes. Zesty bitterness follows through. Very nice, and tastes better than it smells. I think the white grapes are the main cause of that. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy but slightly drier than the other Trillium offerings, good carbonation, mild-moderate zesty bitterness. Overall, a nice twist on a DIPA, very tasty and as usual, really well-done. 880 charactersStevedore, Apr 01, 2016

A: A super murky, dense and beautiful grapefruit juice color with a thin white head this disappears quickly. 
S: Another absolute juice bomb. Tons of mango, pineapple, grapefruit juice and lemon. A bit of dusty malt, hop resin and white grape in the background.
T: Layers and layers of flavor here. Opens with some kiwi and white grape, throws a ton of pink grapefruit at you and then closes on a hoppy citrus pith and smooth white wine note. Integrates the Sauvignon Blanc grapes into the Galaxy hops seamlessly. Wasn't sure this could work, but it's an amazing beer. 579 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 01, 2016
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Interesting concept here, was really excited to try it. First off, great color, very hazy, typical Trillium in that regard. The aroma is very juicy, lots of orange, grapes, very inviting. The taste is where this loses me as I feel like the hops and grape juice play well off each other. Pretty bitter, never really changes as it warms. Overall, nicely done.
Love Trillium going for something out of the box but just doesn't work for me. Hope they keep experimenting though! 474 charactersrjp217, Apr 01, 2016

Pours opaque golden yellow with a bubbly white foam head. Smells like dank pine, white grapes, guava, passionfruit, mango, pear, pineapple, and earthy grass. Tastes like big white grapes, some tropical guava, mango, pear, passionfruit, pineapple, white grapefruit, mild crackery malt, with dank pine and earthy grass. Feels medium bodied, smooth with moderate carbonation. This one breaks the barrier between beer and white wine. Very unique while still maintaining that juicy fruity feel. Overall a great DIPA. 540 charactersStoutElk_92, Mar 30, 2016

Smells of oranges, peppery malts, and sweet sticky citrus.  Taste is a bitter bite, followed into the citrus mixed with the wine.  The wine gives it a light sour flavor.  Cracker-like malts.  If you're used to Trillium IPAs, the Sauvignon Blanc is definitely a noticeable difference from the norm here.  This beer does a lot of things right, the aroma and appearance are great, but in the end I may prefer a little more of their traditional style. 507 charactersanteatr23, Mar 27, 2016

The smell at first threw me off, but as you start drinking it the smell makes more sense. This is very juicy IPA with a good amount of bitterness. What makes it interesting is when you take a sip you just get heavy juiciness. Then as the juiciness fades you get whacked with the bitterness. After drinking it for a bit your teeth feel like you have been chewing pine tar. Very well brewed beer. Keep 'em coming! 514 charactersbrandonld23, Mar 27, 2016

Wow. The flavor is equally as shocking. A fruit puree with Sauvignon Blanc wine poured into it. All of the tropical fruits are there. The Nelson Sauvin is dominant. The Sauv Blanc is dominant, too. This is easily one of their coolest beers. Big flavor and a bit of alcoholic heat with medium bitterness. Nailed it. Nailed it. Nailed it. 645 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 26, 2016

S: Not bursting with hop aromas like most of their beers. When you shove your nose into a snifter of Trillium beer you're usually bombarded with hops. This one is very sweet smelling
T: God damn! Juicy, piney, sour(!?), hoppy as all hell. I really wasn't expecting such a powerful beer. Confounding, almost challenging. Finishes like the dryest white wine I've ever had. As the beer warms up the wine settles and the finish is boozier and pinier. Just awesome.
O: Would not sleep on this one. Reminds of Heady Topper in a spiritual sense. Just a total flavor bully. Right up there with Headroom, upper case, all their special release beers.  Don't get hung up on the grape juice, just roll with it, and you'll be rewarded with an absolutely incredible beer. 928 charactersJonnyJuicebox, Mar 24, 2016

S - Nelson at every turn. White grape, white wine, grapefruit. Then there's orange sherbet and a little bit of lemon.
T - Juice everywhere with no relief in sight. The addition of the Sauvignon Blanc juice makes this lean more towards white wine than a big DIPA. Some moderate bitterness near the end switches to grapefruit acidity on the finish.
F - While full-bodied and creamy, I think it tends to thin out a little on the transition to the finish. I'm not daring to call it watered-down, but other Trillium offerings are more full-bodied. Carbonation also seems to be lacking. Still though, thanks to the abundance of juices, the drinkability is through the roof with no alcohol presence.
O - This isn't the typical hop overload like a lot of other Trillium IPA's as the Nelson and white wine juice have turned this into a tropical fruit drink experience with a dash of hop bitterness on the finish. I would have preferred a little more balance between the two flavor profiles, but this is still a worthy, juice forward DIPA deserving of the Trillium name. 1,122 charactersThrewRedButter, Mar 23, 2016

Lemon peel aroma
The most noticeable flavor is the bready-ness, everything else is standard Trillium world-class hoppy brew

4.64/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 750 bottled less than a week ago (I believe 3/18/16). Lightly carbonated, this pours a glowing hazy orange/yellow with a thin amount of wispy head which all but disappears.  
The nose is like a trampoline, bounces right off from the first drop with hints of grape notes, pine resin, and a beautiful combo of bright hop aromas that give hints of pineapple, lemon, peach and tangerine.  
Dialed in gets me most as it hits my palette with a nice mix of white wine and grapes, and leaves such a nice tropical fruit flavor on the back end. Having had the Speed Dial test batch, I can honestly say they are similar, but I feel that Dialed In achieves a better overall balance and that hazy Trillium juice bomb tradition. 730 charactersSolebird23, Mar 22, 2016
