4.65/5  rDev +4.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 516 oz. can poured into an IPA glass. 4-pack canned 3/1\17. Only available in Vermont. Just one of the many sought-after Vermont Double IPAs like Heady Topper that are unfiltered and have a ton hops added into the boil. Not much is said about the beer on their website, so let's just dive in.
L - amber color, super hazy and cloudy, frothy white foam with medium heavy lacing. Super tiny floaties but that is to be expected. 
S - nice combo of grapefruit and pine, that is something to be said about the hops they chose. Medium high aroma, very aromatic
T - grapefruit peel, spruce/pine, more on the juicy side then leads up to a pine resin finish. Other notes are pineapple, orange peel, mango. Malts are not prevalent and the hops are really the dominant flavor
F - alcohol is medium light, juicy medium body, resinous pine finish. Carbonation medium, overall really smooth
O - My fridge is really spoiled having this in there. Definitely a top shelf Double IPA. Very lucky to have gotten a 4-pack because this is really good stuff. If you are visiting Vermont and strike out on Heady Topper, hopefully you will come across this one and you will go home happy. Cheers! 1,174 charactersctylinebeer, May 21, 2017

Smell:  A bouquet of resin, with pith and piney tones prominent; another whiff brings in orange, pink grapefruit, mango and passion fruit
Taste:  A resiny delight on the taste buds, with the orange, passion fruit and pink grapefruit flavors building; there is mango, underneath, but the swallow brings on the pine; slightly boozy in the finish
Mouthfeel:  Medium to full body with moderate to high carbonation
Overall:  I have been looking for this beer for a while and finally got to try it; more of a West Coast style than the juice bombs coming out of New England (and other places) nowadays but a really good example of that style
Thanks, colby600, for the opportunity 843 charactersbrentk56, May 05, 2017

Look- A dark hazy amber texture with a thick two fingers of foamy head. Lacing down most of the glass.
Smell- A nice citrus hop with some grapefruit thrown in. I think it may be Mosaic hops for this one.
Taste- Very close to the smell with a nice mix of grapefruit and wonderful hops mixed in. The finish is slightly dry but still a fantastic juiciness. Feeling the straight up NE IPA taste kicking in.
Mouthfeel- Moderate to heavy carbonation. A little stronger feel than I expected from the taste.
Overall- Fiddlehead has really figured out how to rock the Mosaic hops. The fruit juiciness is mixed with the hoppy taste to form a fantastic NE style IPA. So lucky to have a couple more of these cooling. 748 charactersKdouble, Apr 30, 2017

Aroma is pine  and grapefruit.   Taste? Like chewing on a grapefruit pine cone dipped into a little sea salt.  Hops are still present after 3 months, though I can imagine how powerful they are closer to canning. Bitterness, check. Tinge of heat...yes.  The mouthfeel is close to full, things get a little sticky as it warms, and the carbonation is medium.  Overall, a highly recomendded IIPA.

Beer is a hazy apricot color with a finger and a half of off-white head that had good retention and spotty lacing. Aroma is stonefruit, oranges, pine, malt and slight alcohol. Taste is a very balanced IIPA with stonefruits, citrus, pine and moderate malty backbone. Mouthfeel is medium and substantially carbonated to the point of prickliness, with a dry alcohol finish. Overall this a world class IIPA that is more West Coast than its Vermont brethren. It is amazingly balanced, and worth picking up if your lucky enough to do so. 639 charactersMJSFS, Apr 27, 2017

The smell is layered well, dank and piney, but with some bright citrus over the top.
The taste is world class. Huge hop punch, plenty of bitterness, piney and citrusy. The taste lingers for ages, and just boasts its alance all the way.
Mouthfeel is soft, with nice carbonation.
Second Fiddle is superb. To me, it's up there with the Tree Houses, Trilliums and Alchemists. A wonder of balance, despite being massive in taste. 467 charactersJamFuel, Apr 19, 2017

Smell is massive Mosaic... very dank with blueberry. Also, I get some spice that I attribute to white peppercorn. Really a nice mixture. Very, very well done.
Taste is resin, white peppercorn, berry sweetness, but balanced. I do not taste any alcohol. Finishes with very little bitterness. A nice aftertaste of spice. Not too sweet either.
Feel is moderate carbonation. I'd say the right amount, but not as soft as some other NE IPAs.
This is the best representation of Mosaic hops I've had to date. I love how the peppery spice plays with Mosaic scents and flavors. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. 728 charactersGabrielEVH, Apr 07, 2017

The nose is dank and juicy. Orangey, piney. 
Taste is more of the nose, with a rind-like bitterness on the back end... said nuggetlover for the first few sips / gulps / quaffs... Gotta say this gets progressively easier drinking- especially dangerous, considering 8.2%. Luckily, I am in my kitchen.

Was lucky enough to get 10 pretty sweet beers sent to me by a college buddy. Had not heard of Fiddlehead until he sent it to me. Excited to give it the old college try.
Poured a medium yellow hazy color with three fingers of rocky white head. Very light bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. World-class layered lacing. Almost perfect retention. (Sight - 4.50)
Smelled Centennial, Amarillo and Mosaic for hops, and most likely Citra as well. Also getting orange blossom, orange creamscicle, tangerine, spoiled citrus fruit, tropical juice and some dankness. (Smell - 4.00)
Taste followed the nose for the most part, arguably better. Got orange blossom, orange cream, tangerine rind, orange marmalade, mango, pineapple, pine, green leaves and some grapefruit. For hops mainly getting Centennial and Citra, but still Mosaic and I think Amarillo. (Taste - 4.00)
Light body. Oily texture. Lively carbonation. Abrupt, citrusy finish. (Feel - 4.25)
This was pretty good for a NE IPA. Not necessarily my favorite style, but this was good. (Overall - 4.00)

It has some tangerine sweetness but also some grapefruit. It's dry and pithy. Kind of has some sticky resin to it. A little bit of that oily citrus fruit peel. It's a really nice beer, but I don't find the hops particularly bright. It certainly plays second fiddle to Mastermind in Fiddlehead's catalog. 369 charactersSheppard, Feb 03, 2017

Head retention is good. Lacing is fair. Aroma is orange zest, mango, and pine hops. There is a rich biscuity, bready malt quality as well. Flavor profile is orange zest, mango, payapya, with some pine and resin hop stick to it. Malts really cut throw the hops, and come in the form of biscuit and bread notes. It has a large presence to it, yet is still balanced. Mouth feel is filling, with a thick DIPA texture to it. It has a little bit of graininess, and fizziness as well. Overall, a sublime DIPA that features plenty of popping hop action. The malt notes are great, and really bolster this beer into a thick, experience of a DIPA.

4.5/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5appearance- Dark orange amber in color and very hazy (almost turbid).  Pours a foamy three inch head.
aroma- Right from the start this seems heavy on mosaic with pine and grapefruit but also a sweeter/fruiter smell of berry and orange citrus.
taste- The sweet orange citrus is very prevalent at first along with a mild bitterness.  It then switches over to less sweet flavors of grapefruit and pine, leaving a resinous finish.  The malt provides a substantial body to this beer, giving it a little bit of chewy texture and helps round out the bitterness.  There's definitely a little caramel sweetness to the malt, but it also has a dry breadiness as well.
feel- Medium/full bodied and low/medium carbonation.  Definitely a fuller bodied dipa with a chewy texture, but overall it drinks easy enough and is clean enough for a dipa.
overall- Didn't know what to expect from this beer going in, but it definitely did not disappoint.  This has a great mix of classic grapefruit/pine hops along with some fruiter "new school" hops that blend really well together.  Really wish more of the NE ipas incorporated NW/west coast hops as they add additional flavor and bitterness.  The malt and texture of this beer are great as well with the malt providing good flavor as well a soft/full feel.  Really good stuff and easily one of the best dipas from Vermont. 1,354 charactersCTbrew32, Jan 10, 2017

Look is a slightly hazy orange to light orange brew, with a finger sized head, but significant lacing that sticks.  
Smell is hops and fruit, but not predominant like most juicy IPAs.  
Taste follows the nose, juice, hops, dank, but balanced.  Really well done done DIPA.
Mouth feel is medium bodied.
Overall a great beer.  I'd like more fiddle head in my life. 387 charactersJay_P22, Jan 01, 2017

extremely strong citrus scent apparently even when pouring. nice
head shrinks quickly but foamy bits remain for awhile.
dark orange and opaque. glows a nice muted orange in light.
not a thick carbonation with good robust carbonation bitterness up front that you really feel on the tongue, but not a high carbonation level, or lasting presence. doesn’t fizz or foam up in your mouth at all; right on entry only
immediate, great citrus fruits and level of bitterness. less “fruity” and “tropical" than a lot of NE DIPAs and a little more bitterness, but lighter body and not aggressive at all. No strong malt. Finishes with some NE DIPA hop flavor.
The light bitterness and perfect thickness mouthfeel accompanied by a nice citrus overtone and wonderful aroma make this a very nice beer. 821 charactersj_d_b, Oct 03, 2016

(APR 2016)
Bready, Grainy, Clean, Toasty
It’s a rarity to see an American brewery take on this style and absolutely nail it. The clean, toasty, nutty malt aroma and the fullish body with a fresh grain flavor throughout is a solid start. The hop bitterness is quite noticeable, but even at its semi-aggressive level it’s simply big enough to achieve balance. Layered malt flavors open up with each sip, and Junkyard Pedigree is by far the most interesting and flavorful malt forward beer I’ve had in a good while. [Jason]

4.43/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5On my trip to Vermont this was one of the best IPA/DIPAs I had. I actually found it better than SoS and Heady. This slightly orange beer had a burst of grapefruit on the nose and even more grapefruit when you taste it. The only aspect of this beer that isn't world class is the mouthfeel. I thought it was a little thin and a bit too much carbonation. It could have gone down a little smoother. I, however, feel very lucky that I was drinking the beer the day it was canned at Fiddlehead. It doesn't get any fresher than that! 526 charactersELS, Jul 30, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Fiddlehead is definitely climbing the ranks of best breweries in Vermont in my opinion. Second Fiddle is up there with the best IIPA's anywhere. Comes in the ever popular 16oz can.
Pours a light orange, almost tangerine color with a fluffy off white head. Fairly hazy. Aroma is huge with this one. Smells of tropical fruits with some dankness explode out of the glass. Taste is a juice bomb. Tropical fruit juice for days. A little of the dankness from the aroma comes through in the taste too. Medium mouthfeel with nice carbonation which helps clear the moderate bitterness. This is a well crafted beer and I consider it right up there with the best in Vermont for sure. 673 charactersdaudelin2000, Jul 17, 2016

A - Pours a very hazy orange gold color with a thick, frothy white lacing ring.
S - Tropical fruit, mango, papaya, and peach.
T - Lots of tropical fruit dankness that starts sweet and ends bitter - papaya, red grapefruit, tangerine, peach and apricot.  Sweet most of the way through but changes to citrus and pine bitterness at the very end.  
M - Coats the mouth with sweet tropical fruit and creates a bit of a cotton cloth texture on the lining of your mouth.  
O - This is a fabulous D-IPA and does not disappoint. 583 charactersjzeilinger, May 30, 2016
4.64/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured 16oz can into snifter. Clear, deep golden orange with a 2 finger white head. Nice retention that leaves a thin cap and webs of lacing. The aroma of hops blast you with a punch of floral and pine, grapefruit, other citrus like tangerine, and a few tropical notes. Some aromas of light sweet malt. A nice flavor of grapefruit, citrus and pine followed by tropical notes of mango and passion fruit. The sweeter malts bring up the middle. Finishes with a nice citrus and bitterness. Seems to be just right and the carbonation really fills it out. Finishes with resin and sticky dryness. Delicious IIPA that reminds me of New Glarus Scream. 642 charactersRi0, May 29, 2016

Poured at 50°F from a pint can (canned on 11Mar16) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 16May16.
LOOK: A fingers worth of white foam is formed after pouring. Honey orange in color with a high amount of cloudiness. There is a large quantity of both medium and small rising bubbles. Lacing is moderate in quantity and both thick and thin.
SMELL: Strong aromas of mango, papaya, peach, and apricot are met by subtle aromas of white bread, piney hops, grapefruit, orange, and tangerine. 
TASTE: Strong piney hop and mild mango, papaya, peach, and apricot flavors first strike the palate. Mild white bread as mango, peach, papaya, and apricot grow slightly stronger. Subtle grapefruit, orange, tangerine and bitter hops finish off.
FEEL: Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated. Goes down somewhat smooth. Finishes with a strong and unpleasant dryness. 871 charactersMyotus, May 17, 2016

L: Beautiful slightly hazy deep golden amber. 2F+ soapy head, pretty good retention, lots of lacing and a ring.
S: Awesome floral, citrus, tropical bouquet. Lots of mango, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel. Piney dankness behind. A bit of light malt to keep it all together.
T: Fruit bomb up front with pineapple, citrus, mango all working great together. Light malt. Piney and slightly bitter on finish. Definitely a juicy character to it.
F: Medium-bodied, light to medium carbonation. Very well constructed, bitterness and alcohol heat well-controlled and finish has right amounts of dry and sticky.
O: Very worth the side-trip and extra expense and definitely lives up to all the hype. 798 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Apr 16, 2016

Smell is definitely sweet pine, and sweet tropical. Very sweet resinous hops that make your mouth water. The taste just brings out how much of a big beer this really is. Pretty malt foward, big hop resin with not that much tropical notes. Maybe some very slight pineapple but that's about it. Overall a big, solid DIPA. Wish the sweet tropical notes in the nose carried on to the taste though. 466 charactersMateo2699, Mar 20, 2016

Appearance:  A two finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a slightly hazy pale yellow orange color with good clarity and vision of tiny bubbles coming up through the glass.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Resiny pine, lemons, citrus, tropical, bready, biscuity, toasted, and pale malts. 
Taste:  The hop flavor is do tasty with nice malt flavors to balance things out.  Light tingly bitterness and chewy notes.  Very smooth, tasty, and no signs of alcohol too.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, light to medium bodied, light tingly bitterness, medium carbonation, delicious, and crushable fir being 8%.
Overall:  Got to admit that this is one of the best DIPA'S I've ever had.  If I could ever get my hands on another can,  I'll enjoy UT as much or possibly more. 856 charactersFlounder57, Mar 08, 2016

4.03/5  rDev -9.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Look: Amber with two fingers of nice white head.
Smell: Piney and resinous. There's some bready malt and a citrus element to it as well. It's just not very explosive or potent smelling...no wow factor like I would expect from such a reputable beer.
Taste: Nice balance between malt and hops with a dank, resinous finish. It's lacking that traditional simcoe taste and has a more palate attacking, piney bitterness, but it's not overwhelming. I'm surprised at the amount of malt to this...it's just heavy on the malt and pine. The finish is a tad bitter for my liking.
Feel: You can tell it's a double,there's definitely some body to it that distinguishes it from  a single. There's moderate carbonation that implies its strength.
Overall: Maybe it's just because this is 5 weeks out at this point, but this didn't blow me away as I had expected to be. Will have to re-review a fresh can. 891 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Feb 20, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This beer pours a very cloudy golden amber color with a huge, fluffy bright white head. Retention is amazing and there are a ton of webbed sheets of lacing. Smell is outstanding. Fruity, piney and dank. All the staples of a great IPA. Taste is the same, but a little more balanced than the smell would lead you to believe. Feel is perfect. Very soft and pillowy with a little bit of bitterness, but still sooo smooth. Overall this beer is top notch. Did a blind tasting with this, Heady, SOS and Lambo Door, and this one actually came out on top. It has that piney dankness that the others lack, but still manages to be so soft on the mouth feel. World class! 659 charactersCNoj012, Feb 17, 2016

S- Rather than the over the top citrus in alot of DIPA's from Vermont, this one is much more Piny and dank.
T- The taste follows the nose in that it is more pine than citrus. Rather than being a hop bomb, this beer is far more balanced and easy drinking despite the 8.2% abv.
F-The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carb. The pine dankness really lingers on the tongue.
O- This beer is one to seek out if you like more balance in your DIPA than Heady or Sip. The dankness is also something that sets it apart from it's compatriots. It's well worth seeking out if you can get it. 683 charactersNotAlcoholicJustAHobby, Feb 14, 2016

Just enough caramel malt backbone.  Medium, very soft mouthfeel.  This is a delish bitter IPA. 374 charactersNolaHopHead, Feb 13, 2016

PINE AND SUBTLE CREAMINESS
Poured darker than expected since I first had it out of the can.. Dark Gold, slight haze. Smell subtle citrus and woody aroma
For an 8.2% beer, you barely taste any alcohol and better yet has amazing mouthfeel. Hugs your entire mouth without being overly assertive. Initial pine and citrus grapefruit notes upfront with a creamy finish in the back, makes this DIPA super friendly and drinkable.
Everyone needs to try this awesome East Coast DIPA! 526 charactersbol3by, Jan 08, 2016

4.64/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75hazy orange in color. couple fingers of head, leaves some lacing. drinking it the day after it was canned so im especially pumped on this one! 
nose on this is really dank - zesty citrus and resinous hops predominate, getting huge orange and grapefruit scents as well as pineapple and grassy notes... also something on the sweeter side, creating a nice tropical scent. the second you crack this beer your gonna be impressed and eager. 
taste begins with citrus that is complimented by a subtle sweetness. finishes with a beautiful spicy bitterness on the tongue. very drinkable and balanced. 
overall I thought this was a really great beer and I'm glad I got a chance to try it right after it was canned as both taste and smell seemed extremely fresh. really pleased that I got a case of this, was definitely worth seeking out! 830 charactersHyptochrons, Jan 01, 2016

This is a good beer but a little over hyped. There is a great aroma coming off this beer but the flavor does not live up to the nose. (My beer was canned 15 days before I drank it). I don't think this beer lives up to the hoppy beers coming out of Tree House, Other Half, Trillium, or the big three Vermont breweries but it is a solid beer. Not worth actively seeking out but  well worth drinking if you come across it. 432 charactersjvillefan, Dec 31, 2015

Drank from the can.  Nice tropical noise with a taste that follows.  Very little sweetness much like all the other VT DIPA/IPAs.  Subtle malt character that lets the hops shine.  Very tasty.  Down the can very quickly and went for another.  Even the burps taste great!  Will def seek out and try and get more of. 335 charactersCraftEyeDoc, Dec 31, 2015

4.57/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a beautiful hazy golden orange color with a big foam head and frothy sticky lace that displays excellent retention. 
The orange and grapefruit zest hits you in the nose immediately. This is followed by lots of tropical fruit.
The taste is very juicy; grapefruit, mango, passion fruit and pear. It is tangy and sweet on the backend. As the drink progresses further, the more piny hops tones make themselves known in a way that is assertive but not overpowering. As this happens, the finish becomes more bitter and dry, yet, the overall fruitiness is not lost. 
The body is medium to light. It is scary how easy to drink this is. The carbonation is soft but tingly. The overall balance is amazing.
This is truly one of the greats! You can only find it in Vermont, which is what I brought home on a recent trip. It is a true testament to the quality of this brew that it can undoubtedly hold its own against other Vermont brews such as Heady Topper and Sip of Sunshine. 972 charactersGajo74, Dec 12, 2015

Never had this before and never heard of Fiddlehead either, as none of their offerings are currently available in this neck of the woods. After enjoying this beer immensely, I can say that I'm the better for having it and at some point, would make the trek to Vermont to get more of this on my way to Hill Farmstead and Lawson's Finest. Amazingly, this beer was on par with those brewed by those big boys!
Wonderful pour to this as the beer had a cloudy, off-gold appearance with a frothy head, and nice aroma. Lots of orange, tangerine, and earthy hops in it, as the citrus pith, rind, and tropical fruits came out in the taste. A slight candied sweetness set in later on as the hop oils were also present but not potent enough to overpower everything else. Nice balance here as the bitterness was not burning and faded away softly at the end, leaving some melon and ruby red grapefruit to blissfully linger into my next sip.
Sure, this was strong but I didn't taste most of the alcohol in this at all. It was noticeable at the end but not to the point where it detracted from the overall enjoyment of this. Although there wasn't a lot of lacing left on the side of my pint glass, this was thick enough to not just slide down and crisp enough to have a minty finish to it. On par with SingleCut's releases, this is further evidence that IIPA's don't have to be overpowering hop bombs to be highly rated. Fabulous stuff that deserves to be more widely distributed! 1,535 charactersJerzDevl2000, Nov 17, 2015

Treating this as a DIPA, this was poured into a tulip for review.
The appearance was a soft hazy burnt orange color with a slight transparency allowing soft carbonation to be seen rising at a moderate pace to fill a one finger white foamy head. This head dissipates at a nice pace leaving some stringy lacing sliding into the beer.
The smell has some tangerine and grapefruit pulp becoming juicy and floral tones soften into light melon and then some pine with a touch of spice to blend nicely.
The taste was sweet to a light spice with a touch of dry earthiness. A dry clean sweet floral aftertaste leads into a refined sweet earthy finish.
The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a sly carbonation to hit underneath and allowing a slight oily slick feel sliding over my tongue.
Overall, in a world filled with fantastic DIPA's, Fiddlehead seems to have staked their claim near the top with this one. 1,090 charactersBack_in_the_Saddle, Nov 16, 2015

The nose is tons of citrus, some mandarin orange and lemon most notable. The first thing I notice on the first sip is just how amazing of a mouth feel this beer has. Up there as one of the best examples of a creamy mouth coating yet silky new england ipa. The taste begins with a blast of citrus, nice blend of orange and tangerines, before a nice wave of grapefruit and pine rush your taste buds for a long finish. The aftertaste leaves orange and grapefruit lingering. Quality beer. 533 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Oct 23, 2015

S: Tropical fruits and citrus dominate the nose. Very pleasant, very Vermont.
T: Follows the smell, although the citrus notes like grapefruit peel really come through in the taste. 
F: The balance is a little strange. It's a little sweet and also a tiny bit too bitter. I really like the smell and the flavor but I was hoping for a better mouth.
O: Despite some nitpicking with the feel, this is another great VT DIPA. I was happy to finally get my hands on some, and was even happier that it was fresh. 599 charactersCayseyW, Oct 13, 2015

Def good, but more hype than anything.  For me, Sip of Sunshine blows this away in that style. 346 charactersdahlen22, Oct 12, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I tried this on tap at Siptemberfest, enjoyed chilled in a glass.
The appearance is a hazy golden amber look like peach nectar with thick white head. The smell is tropical with tons of citrus with a fresh sweet fruit quality and slight herbal dank accent. The feel is full of hop resins the oily smooth moderately biter texture with the perfect amount of carbonation and semi-dry finsish.
The flavor is excellent, load of tropical and dank herbal hop flavors with subtle citrus fruitiness and light malt in the back with not a ton of bitterness but enough to know what you are dealing with -mainly the hops are juicy and taste fresh which is just delicious and makes you want more after each sip. This is up there with some of the best of this style if not one of my all time favorites -must try/world class~! 811 charactersSlatetank, Sep 28, 2015

Aroma is sweet, crisp, biscuity malt with some caramelized tangerines. Nice balance between sticky sweetness and crisp bread notes. On the taste, that sweetness is balanced by garlic and herbal notes. Not very fruity, but I do get grapefruit pith mid palate. More bread and crisp malts. Mouth feel is medium. Sticky in some places. Crisp in others. This is a well crafted beer. I only wish it had more fruit. 471 charactersdanh53, Sep 27, 2015

4.16/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Straight pour from a 16oz can a constricted-top wineglass. This was canned nine days ago, according to the date stamped in black ink on the underside of the can (“9/4/2015  SHIP OF FOOLS”). It’s been kept in good conditions and chilled in the fridge for about 48 hours. 
Appearance (4.75): About three fingers of active, bubbly foam the color of ivory rise off of the pour, capping a moderately hazy, dark orange body with amber tones in its core. The head dies down slowly, leaving a quarter-inch little biscuit of dense foam floating on the surface of the beer, along with a few broken but stubborn collars and a patchwork of splotchy lace all around the glass. As the beer goes on, the lacing and collars merge into one insane mash-up of foamy film and frothy clumps all around. Really, really impressive. 
Smell (4.25): Rich citrus aromas (papaya, a bit of overripe pineapple, maybe a little mandarin) mingle with light floral, earthy bud, and candied orange peel notes. There’s a moderately substantial malt body underneath the hops, from the smell of it, coming out with some pancake batter, honey, and brioche—but all swept under the sweetness of papaya and melon. As it warms, tart lime juice and a resinous, piney character pop up. 
Taste (4.0): In contrast to the nose, fresh-cut grass and mildly herbal bitterness lead the way, backed up by white grapefruit zest and nice floral tones. The malt body is less obvious, offering sugar cookies and a bit of plain white bread, shaded by just a faint papaya sweetness. Some more white grapefruit, and flesh this time as it warms . . . but really, this is dominated by grassy and pithy hops, as well as a piney flavor that creeps up as the beer goes on. No sign of booze, which is impressive for 8.2% ABV. It’s very well-crafted and pleasant, but not as dynamic or juicy as I was expecting. Still—really, really tasty. 
Mouthfeel (4.5): The body is smooth, silky, and feels a medium weight, belying its size; the hop oils offer a drying feeling that only increases, subtly, as the beer moves around; the carbonation is very subdued at first, but then pops up with an assertive tingle wherever the beer’s gone. The silky feel, smooth carbonation, and the dry body and finish make this waaaaaay too easy to drink. No sense of its size or strength. 
Overall (4.0): To be honest, this beer is not what I expected. For some reason I had it in my head that this would be another supremely juicy, dank, opaque New England IPA. Instead, this beer’s characterized by a lighter hop character that’s still assertively bitter but dominated by grass (along with a bit of herbs and citrus zest), a shape-shifting malt body, and an insanely silky, drinkable feel. Not what I expected, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. Is it worth the top-tier Vermont hype? Not in my opinion, but definitely worth at least a four-pack, at least once. 2,902 charactersfmccormi, Sep 14, 2015

S - 5.00 - Wow! So many aromas going on in this beer! Dank, yet floral hops and a STRONG presence of vegetables. Cut grass and a green vege I can't quite put my finger on. Cilantro? Scallions? So herbal. Wildly unique. 
T - 5.00 - Monstrous pine up front. Juicy hops in the middle. Light mango, lots of resin throughout. Green onions. Finishes oh so slightly dry, coating the sides of my tongue with sticky bittersweetness. A lingering bitter sensation from the huge hops and alcohol as I sit here digesting this fantastic beer. 
F - 4.75 - Light and fluffy on the tongue. Melts across your mouth, slinking its way into every crevasse, injecting flavor throughout. The perfect delivery system for this beer. 
O - 4.75 - A damn impressive offering from Fiddlehead. It just dawned on me as I was wrapping up the taste portion of my review why I was getting so many grassy herbal notes. I even bought a shirt at the brewery that says "be a fern believer". I'm ashamed it took me this long! Tree House picked tropical fruits, and these guys picked vegetables. So different and so impressive. I see why this beer is so highly thought of. 1,244 charactersagreenman19, Aug 19, 2015

4.81/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a slightly hazy, light amber color with a whitish-tan head that leaves the slightest bit of lacing around the glass. 
The aroma is filled with notes of citrus and pine. I get strong notes of grapefruit and tangerine, with some big notes of fresh pine needles on the back end. Not too subtle, but not overpowering. Definitely a pleasant smelling beer. 
The taste is a perfect balance of sweet and bitter, with the citrus flavors coming through up front and the bitter resin hitting my tongue on the back. I get lots of grapefruit and mango, as well as what I assume to be melon. There's also plenty of bitter, piney hop resin that I can only compare to fresh grass clippings. The sweet, biscuit malt backbone is also present which gives this beer some pretty good balance. 
The mouthfeel is very creamy and medium-bodied with good carbonation. The alcohol is fairly well-hidden. 
Overall, this is yet another fantastic IPA from Vermont. I wouldn't say it's quite on the level of Heady, but it's a lot closer than I expected it to be. 1,042 charactersScaryEd, Aug 16, 2015

Very good retention with some lacing. The aroma is peaches and grapes with tangerine and pineapple. Lots of sweet fruitiness. Mild pine in the background. Light caramel, pretty mild malt character. Taste follows the aroma. It’s quite low on bitterness for the abv and general hoppiness of the beer. Lots of sweet hop fruitiness. Probably a bit low on bitterness for my taste. Finishes mildly dry.

Balanced bitterness, great mouthfeel  - you can taste the water that makes this beer. Loved it! Would seek it out to try again. 388 charactersandilane, Jul 31, 2015

Poured into an oversized tulip. 
A mighty head on this one, firm, foamy, pale white head. Radiant carbonation that surges upward intensely through an opaque, somewhat cloudy copper body. Lace forms eventually but the head just sits there for ages. 5
Piney and citrusy nose. Resin and grapefruit. Zesty. Orange juice. Each pass of my nose brings a new smell that I love. This is potent. 4.25
The taste retains some of the piney resin from the nose, but it's more subdued. Herbal finish that kinda resembles tea. In between it's dank and... more pineyness. As it warms, a sweeter and more orange and grapefruit-like profile emerges. Grapefruit zest is more pronounced on the finish too. 4.25
Excellent balance to the feel of this beer. Feels medium-bodied and malty but has a spicy, resinous quality and the occasional moments of zestiness. Bitterness is substantial but somehow only noticeable after I've nearly finished a can. Well done. 4.25
I have to like this. It's tasty. But when I drink East Coast beers, I want something less like what our NM brews taste like and this is far too much like everything we get out here. 1,190 charactersONovoMexicano, Jul 23, 2015

S: Sliced mango, apricot, and peach. Pineapple. Pine needles. Leafy and earthy. Hints of dried tobacco. Graham cracker and toast malt aromas. Light whiff of alcohol.
T: Juicy peach, mango, apricot. Zested grapefruit. Passion fruit. Pineapple. Earthy pine, leaves, and tobacco pick up a bit middle to end, but the tropical flavors never leave. Spicy in a sweet onion sort of way (subtly though). Very heady. Firm and stable bitterness. Somewhat doughy. Graham cracker malt. Heady and tropical hop finish.
M: Hefty medium body. Round and silky. Prickling carbonation. Some gripping hop astringency. 
O: An absolute gem. One of the finest of its kind in New England and elsewhere. Seek it. 816 charactersryan1788a5, Jul 23, 2015

Pours a nice orange copper, with a small off white head that leaves pretty good lacing.
Smells strong of dank citrus, was so absurdly fresh when I first got the cans. Has since slightly balanced out, but in a very good way. The tastes matches the aroma, fresh hop taste, one of the freshest I've ever had. 
Absolutely delicious beer. And although its Vermont peers in the IPA game cast a very large shadow, Second Fiddle is worthy of its competitors. 647 charactersJordonHoltzman, Jul 21, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Exceptional beer.  Burnt orange and hazy, this was darker than expected.  However, the citrus hop profile keeps the darker (crystal?) malts in balance.  Smell is awesome - some tropical fruit but I get somewhat bitter citrus, maybe tangelo.  Taste follows and alcohol is well-hidden.  Different from Heady or Sip - I would say it's the most fruit-forward of the top VT DIPAs. 375 charactersPaleCale, Jul 11, 2015

The alcohol is very well hidden in this one as it's quite easy to drink.  For a double not overly hoppy but very well balanced. Sturdy malt backbone to balance out the hops. This is very well conceived. I'd be a regular consumer if this was an option. Very nice. 345 charactersZaximus, Jul 10, 2015

She asked about Heady and was told they were sold out ( no surprise ) but they suggested Second Fiddle.  They were dead on.  Very similar, excellent - excellent flavor that seems to get better with each sip. I did get some Heady recently and while I'd still give Heady the nod its by a hair. A thin hair at that.  This is a fantastic beer.  If you're ever in VT make this a stop. 420 charactersnjcraftguy, Jul 10, 2015

Drank this one in a blind test with Sip and Heady and chose this one by a land slide. Nice golden orange color. Fresh, ripened, fruit- peaches, grapefruit, tangerine in the nose. Has a nice bitterness to it up front until the citrus blast rolls in and dominates. Fantastic brew. The only negative comment I can make is with the packaging. The cans are paper thin aluminum and I have had a couple cans puncture on me. 454 charactersOGFGabv, Jul 10, 2015

Aroma is hop-forward and juicy: tropical fruit, pepper, grapefruit pulp and peel, and a touch of herb. Sweet caramel and pale malts linger in the background.
Flavor is as expected: juicy mango and pineapple, ruby red grapefruit, lemon, and a touch of pepper. Malt base is very much in the background, akin to a single IPA.
Smooth, almost chewy feel, extremely drinkable, lively.
This is an absolutely fantastic DIPA; unquestionably world class. 581 charactersRoguer, Jun 21, 2015

Taste: Follows the nose with pine, grapefruit, orange, and lemon. The finish has a little bitterness but no alcohol notes.
Feel: Light to medium and bready body
Overall: I have had this beer three times now and I have grown to appreciate its taste. It isn't exactly a NE juice bomb but it also isn't fully a west coast style IIPA. It is a great IIPA which is very drinkable and has characteristics of both east and west coast IIPAs. 609 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Jun 19, 2015

4.12/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 416oz can poured into a Fiddlehead stemmed glass, almost a teku but not. Enjoyed on May 14, 2015, reviewed from Tasting Journal. 
The beer pours a hazy and cloudy copper color, orange and apricot hues with a thick, billowy, white head, about 2 fingers high, that has great retention and leaves large swatches of lace behind. The aroma is really nice, floral, earthy, dank, citrusy, has nice pine and grassy expressions, citrus peel, wildflower, a bit of bright stone fruit and fleshy tropical fruits with nice doughy malt, pale and lightly sweet. The flavors echo the nose, lots of pine and grassy bitterness, earthy, dank wildflower and resinous hop spice, transition nicely into juicy fruitiness and bitter citrus peel with assertive malt, chewy and hearty, decently balanced. The mouthfeel is nice, coating, crisp, medium carbonation that has a bit of prickliness to it that finishes fully and very dry.
Verdict: A nice double IPA from Fiddlehead, reminds me a lot of a Half Acre beer as it has that similar dank profile that doesn't lean too much on pine, wildflower or grassiness as it's staple, nicely melds them all together and the fruit profile seals the deal on a great treat for any hop head. 1,205 characterskevanb, Jun 17, 2015

A= Deep amber with a thick off white head.  Has some cloudiness. lacing sticks to glass.
S= Lots of citrus, can smell the malts.  Tropical flavors with some resinous pine.
T= Get the citrus and pine up front, earthy and a little spicy, great balance, some residual sweetness from high malt content, nothing to complain about.
M= Medium body and perfect level of carbonation.
O= Great DIPA, above my expectations, no complaints.  Got on the way home from a failed trip to buy their cans (shipment arrived at 3pm, was sold out when I got there at 5:30 at local Woodstock, VT store.  Seeing it on tap a few minutes later made that less disappointing. 722 charactersjhavs, Jun 12, 2015

Aroma of fresh floral hops notes nice citrusy notes and no bitterness. Taste is also dominated by fresh citrusy hops notes with limited bitterness and light residual sugar notes. Light fruity notes could also be detected. Body is pretty full with good carbonation. Very well brewed but lacking a little something to be placed among the great VT IPA. 454 charactersPhyl21ca, Jun 10, 2015

Big 2+ finger off-white head when poured; dies down slowly leaving an uneven layer of foam on the surface of the beer.  Lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  Near perfect!
Smell:  Rich citrusy, hoppy aroma.  Made me want to take a drink.
Taste:  Citrus start (think grapefruit), slightly grassy middle, tart lemony, mild hoppy finish.  Delicious!    
Feel:  Medium body; slight fizz from the mild carbonation and a mildly dry finish.  Refreshing.  Not too dry from the hops.
Overall:  Awesome Double IPA.  One of the best IPA that I have ever had; might even top Heady Topper! 638 characterssprat1960, Jun 09, 2015

Pours great fluffy airy creamy almost 2 finger head that fades at a need pace with tons of lacing coating, hazy wheat orange color. 
Nose brings bright hops, mild dank resin, but lots of citrus, dank resin, orange rind and grapefruit pith, Clementine, orange cream notes, so much dank resin and mild earthiness and hint of pine. 
Taste brings nice orange cream, juice orange cream hops, little tangy, nice dankness, orange rind and nice grapefruit pith, nice Clementine juicy, little earthy grassy hop, faint chewy spicy notes on the back end. Nice creamy malt, little malty flavor. Finish is drier, big lingering spicy hop with nice big bitterness, nice pith and orange peel lingering nicely. 
Mouth is med bod, nice creamy malt, good carb. 
Overall very enjoyable, booze hidden well, nice hop profile, nice creamy malt, well done. 911 charactersjlindros, May 30, 2015

Served in a cervoise
Hazy, dark amber appearance. Slightly short of cloudy. The beer was capped by an inch tall, tight, creamy, foamy, light tan crown. Multiple rings of thick, drippy lacing coated the top portion of the glass.
The nose was hoppy but a bit generic. Citrusy with a hefty dose of orange zest. Some tangerine as well. Subtle tropical fruit notes. Semisweet. Solid overall, but this could have been punchier and more complex. A slight skunkiness was noticeable as the beer warmed.
The flavor profile was definitely more interesting than the aroma. Loads of citrus. Zesty orange peel was quite apparent. The beer was anchored by a slightly sweet, malty backbone. Tropical fruits were noticeable. Mango was most apparent. Lots of white grapefruit flavor on the back end and in the finish. Pithy, somewhat bitter, rind-like notes lingered.
The mouthfeel was silky smooth. Super soft and creamy. Supple. The beer contained a fine, moderate carbonation that gave the beer an incredibly slick fluffiness on the palate. Very impressive.
Second Fiddle is a solid beer that reminds me more of a West Coast-style double IPA than a dank, tropical fruit-forward Vermont-style DIPA. I would be happy to drink this beer again, but I definitely would not go to great efforts to acquire it. 1,333 charactersDamian, May 27, 2015

Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House snifter.
a: Hazy dark orange with a finger thick white head which receded to even surface foam and dense lacing.
s: Moderate strength citrus and pine resin.
t: Follows the nose but with more presence over a hefty bready malt base, followed by a widespread bitterness and slight throat burn.  
m: Medium plus, great body and lots of carbonation tingle.
o; A mighty weighty DIPA in which considerable malt is balances the considerable hops.  Not as citrus-dominated, "juicy" or "dank" as some, but a good solid taste treat. 609 charactersscotorum, May 22, 2015

4.31/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to angrybabboon for four of these bad boys.
Appearance: Hazy medium to dark orange gold. A touch of clarity comes through as it warms. Head is off-white and creamy. Drops to a small clumpy cap and collar with some streaks and splotches of lacing.
Smell: Dank. Pine sap. Some tangerine and mild hints of generic stonefruit. A touch catty. Malts offer a touch of caramelized sweetness with some mild bready elements. Biscuits. Cooked malts. Juicy and floral with a ton of citrus. Grapefruit, ruby red as well. A touch of raw mint. Not particularly aggressive - more dense than assertive. Some pale malt as well.
Taste: Citrus and pine. Lingering bitterness. A woody pine. Some pine resin. Tangerine and grapefruit round it out with a touch of orange. Malts offer a nice balancing sweetness without going too far. Some pale bready malts with a touch of caramelized sweetness. Lightly tropical and follows the nose with the push of general stone fruit - but peach does jump out after a few sips. Warming pushes the peach/tropical elements through the back. Soft yeast. Mint sprig.
Mouthfeel: Medium slightly creamy body. Moderate carbonation with a slight hint of astringency.
Overall: First Fiddle must be a true legend.
This is a Vermont IPA/DIPA for sure. It's decidedly drinkable and not as aggressive as others in the style. Carries that dank thing I've encountered with other Fiddlehead beer, which is a positive in this case. Well worth trying...and now I need to try the regular IPA. 1,500 charactersGoblinmunkey7, May 15, 2015

Aroma is rich and inviting with fresh catty hops. Almost cheesy with pith and rind-like fruity elements before more of an herbal aspect comes into play.
Taste is all about the layers of hop flavoring without getting all that bitter. Somewhat of a melon or cantaloupe flavor, grass and cheesy to vegetal character. Mild alcohol touch and neutral bready grain rounds out the flavors.
This is medium in body and modestly carbonated. Not bad but not great either. The first time I had this was at a bottle share, it was completely new to me, never heard of it before and it wow'd me. So I sought some out to write a full review. This came to me very fresh and im admittedly a little disappointed in it. Good, just not great. 857 charactersstakem, May 14, 2015

Pours a hazy orange-gold with 2 fingers of sticky off-white head. Just an awesome citrus nose and a touch of toasty pale malts. Taste follows with tangy citrus fruits, a nice easy bitterness, and a bit of those nice pale malts. Really smooth carbonation gives it a creamy feel.

Wow, huge juicy citrus hops blast your nostrils as the glass approaches your face. Smells of fresh oranges split open, red grapefruit, lemon zest, pineapple, mango, tangerine, citrus hops, graham cracker, piney hops/pine cones, biscuit, caramel, mild spices and light floral hops. Enough malt backbone to prop this up and keep it juicy citrus perfection.
Tastes like it smells with fresh wet citrus hops, oranges, grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, mango, tangerine, citrus hops, toffee, lightly roasted grains, graham cracker, piney hops/pine cones, biscuit, caramel, mild spices like pepper, coriander and faint cinnamon, dry floral hops, tea leaf and a few earthy notes. Mild bitterness accompanies the strong citrus fruit flavors which dominate this beer. The malt base is a combo of toasted crackers, wheat bread toast and sweet graham crackers which allow the juicy hops to really shine. Really damn tasty beer, something in the water up in northern Vermont is helping make some outstanding beers.
Mouthfeel is slick, smooth and lightly carbonated for an almost slick feel with a medium body that is on the thicker side, finishing bitter and hoppy with a buttery malty aftertaste. 
Overall a great beer that was just a notch or two below Heady Topper on the DIPA spectrum, but this is a fine example of the style that hides the ABV masterfully and is extremely easy to drink. 1,575 charactersCHickman, May 11, 2015

This was new to me and such a great surprise.  Fantastic DIPA that was hazy, but had such a great florally taste with perfect hoppiness.  I see comments saying it isn't Heady Topper....if that is the required bar, many will fail.  This though was once again fantastic - you folks in VT are killing it. 482 charactersBradMacMullin, May 08, 2015

A: Somewhat hazy, but there is some clarity here - medium to burnt orange with some dark gold and honey - pours with a medium size, bright white head, fades to a nearly solid, wispy cap, leaves some  streaks of lacing
S: Nicely hoppy, but not as explosive as one may expect - lots of citrus and fruit - ripe tangerine, grapefruit, and ruby red grapefruit - fleshy, juicy, and floral - big citrus aromas, but it's a softer aroma than a hoppy blast - tropical fruits, peach, and melon - some spicy and piney aromas - pale, clean malts
T: Citrusy, juicy, and is there some Nelson Sauvin in here? - tangerine, pink and ruby red grapefruit flesh, juice - some light tropical flavors and stone fruit - some lightly spicy, lightly earthy pine - a distinct fruitiness with hints of white wine that lead me to think I'm either losing my mind or this features Nelson hops - pale malts at the base, very clean - minimal sweetness, minimal hint of alcohol
M: Medium body, carbonation on the low side, smooth and almost oily, but mostly dry
O: Waiting for Third Fiddle
After drinking Mastermind, and now this, I think Fiddlehead has potential to brew something that will knock Heady Topper of its throne. But Second Fiddle is not that beer... After three cans, I have to reluctantly state that I think it's great, but not excellent  (and not as good as Mastermind). The hop profile here is lovely, but it seems to pull some punches. However, like Mastermind, this is stupidly easy to drink. This appears to be the strength of Fiddlehead. I look forward to their future efforts. 1,602 charactersangrybabboon, May 07, 2015

Appearance - The body is very cloudy, to the point where nothing can really be seen through the glass. A rocky head fills the last quarter of the glass with a frothy texture that sits lazily atop the liquid.
Aroma - The nose is super dank and filled with pine and floral notes. There's just a hint of citrus, but for the most part this is more earthy hops on display.
Taste - The taste seems a bit off compared to the other big IPAs coming out of Vermont; Second Fiddle is a little more spicy, herbal and earthy, and besides some melon flavors, it isn't exactly fruity. I'm not a huge fan of the finish at all, as it is slightly buttery and spicy.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is nice and full-bodied. I'd like a little a more carbonation, though.
Closing Arguments - I'm not sure if this beer falls off quickly, or if something is wrong with this batch, but I'm not digging this beer at all. It certainly doesn't compete with the heavy hitters in this style or state. Maybe the second can will be better... 1,028 charactersnhindian, May 04, 2015

Feel is slick and smooth, just the right touch of carbonation. Taste is citrusy, piney, grassy and an ever so slight oniony finish. Bitterness doesn't last long and finishes clean. Second Fiddle reminds me more of Surly Abrasive, less of Fat Heads Hop Stalker and maybe a bit similar to Heady minus the oniony finish. Terrific beer. 413 charactersGOBLIN, May 02, 2015

This is a very smooth brew, strong hop presence but not overtly bitter or piney.  Just really tasty, not playing second fiddle to the big boys at all.  Dark copper color, nice creamy, sticky looking head and retains well.  Taste is delicious, finishes very strong. 346 charactersJwburns75, Apr 24, 2015

The nose and taste are both very hop forward with lots of citrus rinds, pine and some tropical fruit notes.  there is a nice malt profile balancing all the hops, but it is in the background allowing the hops to be the star.  The nouthfeel is smooth and round but with enough carbonation it keep it incredibly drinkable.  Just a great example of the style! 457 charactersmtomlins, Apr 08, 2015

3.76/5  rDev -15.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Metallic. That's the word. There's a rogue metallic note that sneaks into both the nose and palate on this one. The nose is still quite good. Mixed with some green hop notes, wafts of pine, and a touch of tropical fruit, the metallic notes don't seem so dischordant, I guess. The palate is where it does the greatest damage. It combines with fairly strong carbonation levels to give a sharp, shrill punch to the brew. The actual flavor is hard to pin down, as it's not so much piney, certainly not tropical, and not quite earthy (though it hints at the latter). It's just too sharp is all I can say. Can't imagine how this one is held aloft with some of the better VT hop bombs. 678 charactersbreadwinner, Apr 06, 2015

S: Lemon, Melon, Mango - tropical fruits and light citrus
T: Hop water.  My taste buds were taken over by and oniony, orangey, mango like liquid (simcoe hops?).  Not my favorite hop profile, but it oozes with flavor.  Exceptionally smooth, I wish it had a bit more of a bite on the back end.
M: Medium bodied.  Lingering fruit finish.  
O: This stuff is like orange juice beer - in a good way. Deserves the hype it gets. 475 charactersGivemebeer, Mar 30, 2015

Piney and resiny. Huge hop taste, but less citrus. May be my new exemplar what for a VT DIPA is.
Let it wear the crown.
LOOK: A little cloudy. Golden amber but leaning rusty in color. Big airy head.
SMELL: Pine resin over floral notes.
TASTE: Very hop-forward. Citrus notes are muted under the pine resiny flavors. Lingers and really opens up if you let it sit in your mouth for a second.
FEEL: Feels thick, almost chewy. Despite the big head, not big on carbonation -- so doesn't have the bright pop that would go along with that. 665 charactersfounddrama, Mar 21, 2015

Fresh, juicy citrus comes through in the nose. Mango and grapefruit mainly. 
Mango and passionfruit come to mind as flavors. Only Hyzer Flip comes close to this profile. 
Clean finish with some burn from the alcohol and lingering citrus flavors. 
Second Fiddle has a character of its' own in comparison to other DIPAs, such as Heady Topper. It's closer to Heady appearance-wise. 486 charactersBrad007, Mar 13, 2015

Appearance: Cloudy golden haze, decent amount of white pillowy head. Lingers on the side of the glass throughout the pour.
Aroma: Nice earthy hop aroma typical of the region. Decent amount of tropical fruit and citrus fruit notes as well. A very pleasant beer.
Taste: Very well balanced beer, not too better and not too malty either. Citrus grapefruit notes meld well with the earthy hop bitterness. Very smooth and clean finishing, especially for a DIPA.
Overall: One of the most balanced and best I have had, reminds me a lot of Mastermind but amps up the flavor profile a bit more. Still for a DIPA not as sweet as it could be and that is what really impresses me. I wish it was available more often and especially around here, it would be in my fridge all the time. I guess a trip to VT is in order! 863 charactershumuloner22, Mar 11, 2015

So smooth and exploding with great citrus hop bombs.  very very balanced, its exploding with flavors yet the bitterness is just right to make it very very drinkable.  Easily one of the better DIPAS i have had lately. 268 charactersberkshire413, Mar 09, 2015

4.33/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25From the can... this beer pours a fairly deep orange amber color with very good retention and considerable sticky lacing all around.  On the nose, there is a lot of sweet tropical fruit, navel orange, and light pine.  There's really a huge presence of sweet tropical fruit on the nose.  The flavor profile isn't as intense, though it's still pretty pronounced.  Also, while the DIPA IS a bit on the sweet side, there's more than enough hoppy bitterness to counter and balance that sweetness.  The beer actually dries out pretty well on the finish, and finish is pretty clean and fairly bitter.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a long, bitter finish.  The beer definitely delivers plenty of flavor.  Alcohol is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile.  It was somewhat noticeable initially, but the beer seemed to open up a bit and smooth out some as it sat in the glass.  
Really nice beer from this new to me brewery. 927 charactersJohn_M, Mar 02, 2015

A: Hazy, bright, leaves a nice lacing down the side of the glass.
S: Citrusy and sweet with some great earthy aromas. This is what a beer should smell like. 
T: Unbelievably fresh and very sweet, in the best way possible. Huge flavors of orange, tropical fruit, and pine, with a good malty backbone. Absolutely great flavors.
F: Sweet and sticky. Almost no feel from the alcohol. Finishes very clean; the bitterness hits you and fades quickly.
O: I really loved this. The freshness, the huge citrus with the malty balance, the great clean feel, all of it make this a top DIPA in my book. 634 charactersbraican, Feb 23, 2015

3.7/5  rDev -16.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75Can poured into a CBC teku. About a week old, so still good and fresh. Nice appearance, medium amber-orange in color, with an inch of healthy white head; good retention and lacing. Good aroma, thick with citrus and pine hops, notes of ethanol and a firm malt base. In the taste, oily hops that didn't quite come through as good as in the aroma, off-balanced by thick toffee malts, and a twinge of neutral alcohol. Not really a malt bomb, the hops were definitely there, but it was just a little too off-balanced, coming off pretty average for the style. Body was medium, mouthfeel was unctuous and a bit stiff with booze at first. Decent overall, but pretty basic stuff...kind of baffling that there's such a hype over this. 724 charactersRifugium, Feb 08, 2015

4.33/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25The date on the bottom of the can says 1/21/15. Consumed on 2/5/15, making this one about 15 days old. That's pretty freaking fresh considering I got it as a surprise from a friend who's not much of a beer drinker who got it from a friend of his. . . .
A: Poured from the pint-sized can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Body is hazy dark golden with a  1-finger foamy whitish head. Nice collar of lace up top.
S: Hot damn, this is like fresh-squeezed hop juice - of the grapefruity, piney variety. I'm going back and forth whether to give this a 4.75 or a full 5.00. The nose is THAT good. Wow. My wife smelled this and said, "It makes me want to kiss it." (She's a keeper. )
T: Modestly let down by the taste; there's just a one-dimensionality to it that keeps an excellent beer from being phenomenally great. It's heavy on the grapefruit juice, with just a touch of tropical fruit and a hint of pine. If I closed my eyes and you gave me a glass of this I'd think it was time for breakfast, as pink grapefruit comes immediately to mind. Big time hop burps bring back some pine to add to the citrusy grapefruit, along with a touch of onion (did they use Simcoe hops at some point?).... Touch of alcohol warmth is felt at the back of the palate, and in the belly. Not much on malt up front, but a thick-feeling sweetness towards the end makes me think of malt. 
M: Medium in heft. A lack of carbonation makes it feel a bit slick and syrupy at times. 
O: A really good lighter (it's only 8.2% ABV) DIPA. Fresh-hoppy goodness, but I think it would be hard to drink more than one or two of these. 1,592 charactersKendo, Feb 06, 2015

3.72/5  rDev -16.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to world-class, bat-shit-crazy Joe_Grizzly for sending me a wicked ton of good beers that hit my step on Tuesday with enough force to crack the concrete. 16 oz. tall-boy can dated 12/10/14 with something green on the label…I was looking for a stringed instrument, but this looks like someone’s acid trip. I like it. 
The pour is orange with plenty of carbonation & only the lightest hazing to interfere with it’s virgin purity. The nose comes out of the can like a high-velocity round & settles in for the duration: tropical. Encapsulated but not captured in a word. Great fruity sweetness. 
Second Fiddle is the feng shui of IIPAs, perfectly balanced. If you know me, that isn’t a high compliment, & almost instantly excludes it from the top tier of hoppy beers. Still, the brightness of the hops manages to fight through the sweet, cracker-sharp malts & deliver a nice double bang of tropical fruits & a decent scrape of bitterness. Lower levels of springtime flowers & pine, while the finish has an almost white-bread, acetone taste to it (yes, I know that makes no sense, maybe it’s soapy?): odd. Oily & slick & oh-so drinkable. 
Lots to like, but the reliance on malts & the faintly rest-stop-soap finish brings this one down a bit for me. Far superior to Mastermind, I’ll be tucking another into the fridge to bring along to poker next Friday night. Good, solid IIPA. 1,395 charactersmaximum12, Feb 05, 2015

A- Hazy, dark copper body, two finger white head with medium-sized bubbles, nice lacing. Average retention time.  Surprisingly dark for pale ales coming out of that part of the country.
S- Nice caramel backbone supplanted by plenty of pine and citrus. Some mango. The pine is a bit stronger than the citrus here which is a bit different than the usual citrus supplemented by pine hops. Let this one warm up as you drink it- the tropical fruits come out in full force when it gets warmer.
F- The money is here! This beer is bursting with tropical fruit, mango, caramel, citrus juiciness and pine bitterness. This is quite fruity and balanced towards the tropical fruit flavours. Good malt backbone. This is very tasty and flavourful with a nice complexity added by the hops.
M- Medium body, crisp and dry on the palate. Nicely carbonated. A hefty pine and citrus rind bitterness on the backend that balances out the fruity hop flavours.
O- Very tasty DIPA, not quite as good as Mastermind but this is very tasty and easily worth the effort to go after. 1,152 charactersStevedore, Feb 04, 2015

First can, 4 oz sample: while this smells nice it's thin, and slighty vegetal, with a black tea astringency and bitterness
Second can, full pour: I'll go a touch higher on this can, but still underwhelming. Mildly vegetal and a weirdly creamy mouthfeel. 269 characterskscaldef, Feb 03, 2015

Originally had this brew at the brewery in May 2014 but lost my notes.  I did rate this fairly high on Untappd, so big expectations.
Slightly hazy, orange-marmalade color elixir, vigorous pour into SA pint glass.  Huge 2- finger head, large fluffy bubbles and plenty of thick lacing.
Oranges, pineapple, subtle dank pine with some bready malt sneaking in.
Starts with some awesome tropical fruit and nice hop bitterness, the malt comes smashing into the party and does tone down the hop profile.
Medium body, well carbonated, refreshing.
If I could, I would give the brew a 4.3 for smell and taste but nostalgia and maybe an almost one month-old can, are at odds. At the time of the initial tasting, we grabbed a growler from the brewery, which is housed alongside a pizza joint, and headed next door for some awesome pie.  The combination of this fine DIPA and the food really create an atmosphere that could lend itself to hyperbole.  But nonetheless, a fine representation of this VT brewery. 1,085 charactersCaptCleveland, Jan 29, 2015

The aroma offers citrus, hops, pine. Plenty of malt backbone to support the hop character. Pine and resinous hops with notes of oranges and a touch of assorted tropical fruits. Also present is a subtle onion / earthy character - not terribly distracting, but sort of lurking there in the background. Medium bodied with a touch of sweetness. Overall, solid, but well behind the stiff VT competition. 495 charactersHuhzubendah, Jan 22, 2015

Pours a clear, saturated amber-orange color, with a decent, froth head.
My room gets filled with tropical smells, while pouring the beer. Has incredibly fruity aromas of lemon, mango, ananas, grapefruit, blood orange and fresh cut grass. Very well put together, with no particular fruit aroma being very dominant on its own, the tropical nose lives from its balance. The malts are quite sweet, biscuity, confirming the sunny, ripe, fruitiness of this beer.
The first thing I note is the supersmooth, almost creamy mouthfeel, together with a prickly note, revealing kiwi qualities among strong developed grapefruit and papaya. No dankness, no pine, just the pure fruit, balanced by the slightly honeyed malts, creating a juicy, fruit overloaded beer. The carbonation is ununsal low, slightly coppery, adding to a slick hop bitterness towards the end, with fruits being still recognizable, while those are developing into a lime direction though, without loosing its tropical character.  It is actuallly a brew, which highlights its sweeter side, despite being a double IPA, due to its well developed maltiness, adding to the sunny, smooth, ripe fruit nature of this beer, with a dry finish to it. 1,243 charactersaleigator, Jan 14, 2015

Mais oui! The date on the bottom reads: "12/31/2014" meaning that it is EXTREMELY fresh and as such, he made me promise to move it to the head of the line, rather than leaving it in the queue. Avec plaisir!
From the CAN: "Pack it in Pack it out".
The Crack! was nice and loud plus I got a squirt across my fingers from another brimful craft CAN. It held a full pint, so an inverted Glug was out of the question. I still got an aggro pour to create three fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention. Lacing was already beginning to form as it slowly fell. Nose smelled like a ground-up Christmas tree! Ohhh. My hops monkey that lurks around my back and on my shoulders began to screech. Color was a hazy Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17). Mouthfeel was dense, thick, like a dollop of DIPA on my tongue. Speaking of my tongue, this immediately went to work, stripping away dead taste buds and worming its way in like muriatic acid. It burns, it burns, but in such a nice way! Life as a hops junkie ain't easy! Having made its way into my stomach, a dull warmth began to spread through my body and the monkey began to settle down. They should make you sign a waiver before drinking one of these things ... Finish was cool, minty, literally breathtaking. I unleashed a belch that allowed me to sense the entirety of my esophageal tract! Phew. More, please. 1,606 characterswoodychandler, Jan 11, 2015

Pours a slightly dark reddish-orange, very hazy and unfiltered looking, with a one inch head, and lots of lacing.
Smells just wonderful, fruity and dank, with grapefruit, tangerine, and a little bit of pine. Smells like this can was absolutely packed with hop goodness.
This tastes just amazing. I've had Mastermind, and was blown away by it, and this also blew me away. It starts up front with a big pine and grapefruit hop bite, with a little bit of bitterness, with a very fruity and sweet tangerine and peach finish. This reminds me of a fruitier and slightly less bitter Heady. 
This medium bodied, with a sweet and crisp mouthfeel, and a medium level of carbonation. It's insanely drinkable, it scares me how quickly I could put down a 4pk if I had it.
Big surprise, another amazing Vermont IPA. 836 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 06, 2015

S-    Piney smell upon opening the can. After pouring in a glass the huge mango smell kicks in and stays there. Also puts off some nice malty notes.
T-   Follows the nose really well. Smooth mango and fruity flavors that just flow over the tongue. Slight malt and cracker taste on the finish. No detectable alcohol taste. 
M-  Feel is slightly heavy, with low carbonation. This beer doesn’t coat the mouth like some other DIPA’s. Just seems to hit the taste buds and go away. 
O-  One of the better beers I have had in a while. It seems on the mark to me. Flavors all meld well and it leaves you craving more after each sip.  Drink ability is high for this one, I will definitely be looking for this when in Vt. 916 charactersMo_fro, Jan 03, 2015

Bit-o-citrus in the nose but not incredibly pungent. The flavor made me smile: a bowl of citrus laced with subtle pine. Perfect. Did not pick up on any dank hop character as I did in the Mastermind and IPAs. Low bitterness on the back end with a light touch of malt.

4.87/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75From the one pint can dated 12/23/2014. So darn fresh on January 1, 2015.
A little cloudy orange pale yellow color with a big white head that lingers and laces. A tad darker and I might have gone with a 5.
The aroma is a 5 with its vibrant floral and citrus hop scents and muted but still noticeable toasted biscuit and pale malts. No booze at 8.2%
Near full body.  A slight acidity but that could be due to the intense hop ingredients.
I said intense and I mean intense. Those floral, grapefruit, and citrus hops explode in the taste and take over everything edging out the toasted malts and finishing bitter and dry. Again, no booze. Perfect taste and aroma and well worth the "world-class" overall rating it has received.  Watch out Heady Topper. 753 characterspuboflyons, Jan 01, 2015

S: Lots of orange in the nose with some hop/pine smell and some malt/caramel in the end.
T: Follows the nose very well. You definitely get some good citrus/hop taste. But from both times i've had this beer there's still too much malt to balance it out on the end, and there's a slight boozy taste.
F: The mouth feel is pretty damn good. Very well carbonated and a great creamy feeling to it. Giving you both refershing and that slight sticky aftertaste. Unfortunately the after taste is more malty/boozy then i prefer.
O: To me fiddlehead is overrated. Both second fiddle and mastermind don't live up to my expectation but both are pretty good beers. 719 charactersGinjaSlice, Dec 25, 2014

A. Pours a beautiful hazy amber with a 2 finger, buttermilk color, foamy/frothy head.  Head sticks around for about 2-3 minutes.  Swirls a full but spotty ring lacing.
S.  I get a citrusy smell at first that brings thoughts of mangoes or peaches and cream followed but some resiny and piney aftertones.
T. Flavor backs up the nose with a citrusy fruit hop highlight balanced by some malt sweetness that brings thoughts of mango or island fruits.  The bitterness is perfect.  Finishes with a bit of a piney and grassy aftertaste.  Loving this beer.
M. Medium bodied but kinda creamy feeling.  Has a nice coat of the mouth.  Perfect carbonation for the style.  Finishes just slightly dry making you want more (but it's not a bad thing with this beer).
O.  A very nice beer.  Got this in a trade with some heady and I prefer this.  Not saying this is better than most people's perception of heady cuz some think it's the best beer in the world.  I'm not there.  Enough about HT.  I love this beer.  Looks beautiful.  Smells delicious. Taste is very well balanced and layered at the same time.  Medium bodied which to me is normal for a DIPA but it has this slightly creamy mouth coating that I just love.  Will be looking to trade for this again! 1,279 charactersIPAGeorge, Dec 23, 2014

The aroma explodes of juicy mangoes, peaches, oranges. Just sweet nectary and fruity.
The flavor follows with sweet orange and grapefruit throughout. Almost towards fruit syrup. A medium sweetness in the middle, with some resinous and grapefruit on the finish. More herbal, pine, resin, tea, on the finish. 
A beer that is dangerously drinkable and addictive, despite its reasonable amount of malt. Impressively clean. Very much a West Coast style, though one of the best in that style. 524 charactersdar482, Dec 18, 2014

Lemme stress that:  A free fucking keg.  Of a somewhat hypey double IPA.  In 2014.  A+ work, guys.
The beer was very good, nearly great.  Heady Topper comparisons are illiterate, however.  Pours thick and hazy.  Smells of dense citrus hops, with loads of grapefruit and pine.  Tastes as it smells, gigantic citrus and pine up front, a lightly boozy middle, and then thick, sweet malt at the back end. 488 charactersmynie, Dec 07, 2014

Appearance - Cloudier than the regular IPA. Slight cream tinge to the head. Decent lacing.
Smell - Better hop aroma, too. Citrusy. Nice orange and some pine in the back. Substantial sweet malt backing.
Taste - Grapefruit. Sweet malt and some caramel. Sweetness masks some of the bitterness, but a hint peeks through.
Mouthfeel - Medium heavy. Slick feeling. Bitterness is muted.
Overall - More enjoyable than their single IPA. Just a hop profile and malt balance. 511 charactersAlieniloquium, Dec 02, 2014

a - brew pours a murky orange with a thin ipa head and some streaky lace.  a bit oily.
s - nose is all about that hop.  a bouquet of deeply ripe tropical fruit...mangoes, tangerines, grapefruit with a hint of lemon.

Pours a medium hazy sunset hue with half a finger of head.
Smells insane.  Incredibly piney and dank.  Full aromas.
Tastes even better as it engages all parts of tongue and palate.

A: 3/3 - golden-amber coloration; low clarity (can't read or see through), initial frothy white head settles into 1/4 finger head with some carbonation lakes and mixed sized bubbles; moderate alcohol legs
S: 12/12 - intense pine and resiny hop aroma (like opening an ounce of Simcoe); with moderate citrus, peach and fruity notes; mild malt character and alcohol; no diacetyl, no DMS
T: 19/20 - moderate bittenerness right up front; followed by huge juicy pine and resin flavors full up the palate; on the back end, there is a mild sweetness and alcohol; some residual sweetness but not-at-all cloying
M: 4/5 - moderate body (with hop oils and alcohol); moderate carbonation; high drinkability
T: 10/10 - damn near perfect DIPA that hits all the high points for me - super juicy, intense pine, citrus and fruity aroma/flavor; mild VT-ish IPA sweetness but still highly drinkable; reminds me of a more juicy DC Brau OTWOA; this is hands-down the best hoppy beer that I have tried in 2014

4.57/5  rDev +2.9%Poured into Tired Hands taster.
Appearance is a deep golden orange with a rocky cream colored head which settles quickly. Decent lacing left on the sides of the glass.
Aroma is huge on pine, grass, citrus (orange peel, lemon pith, lychee), faint wood, nectarine, and sweet hydro weed. 
Taste comes in throwing hard malt blows but quickly turns straight into a hop ringer. This is maltier than heady, slightly more earthy/woodsy, but packing that same citrus punch and subtle pine/tropical fruits. It's quite excellent and has terrific depth of flavor.
Mouthfeel is mediumish bodied with maybe a touch more carbonation than heady topper. Bitterness is pretty aggressive but not overboard. Reminds me of La Cumbre stuff in the bitterness department. Certainly a residual malt sweetness lingers much a la east coast style, but on the restrained end of it. 
A great double IPA for sure. There is an obvious distinction between a good and a great IPA. Here it's obvious this belongs in the latter. Would sub this out for heady any day. But there are still others I'd pick over those two.... Funny, as I keep drinking this I'm staring to get some similarities to Double Sunshine as well. Subtle, but enough to keep me intrigued and continue praising this! 1,262 charactersMarcWP, Aug 31, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +4.7%Bright orange, small head fades fast, laces really well down the glass.  Largely citrus aroma of grapefruit, orange, and citrus pith.  Taste follows through with pleasant grapefruit and citrus dominant flavor.  Touch of doughy malt and caramel keep bitterness in check and bring great balance.  No sign of the ABV.  Medium body, creamy on the palate and a pleasantly dry finish round out a nearly perfect mouthfeel.  Overall a top tier DIPA that brings big citrus flavors and great balance to the hop experience. 514 charactersHopBomb515, Aug 27, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -4.3%i never tire of these vermont ipas, each one always better and fresher than the next. this one is a bright honey color with a tall and lasting head snow white and persistent. the nose here is just great, citra hops and something else in the C family, maybe centennial, it has that woody bitey bitter undertone behind the citrusy fruity hops on top. i like the layering of the hops here, and find the beer beautifully balanced, not with grain but between bittering hops and late kettle and dry hopping characteristics, well scheduled. i also find it scary drinkable at over 8% abv, it drinks more like 6%, with no trace of alcohol in aroma or flavor. the body get just a little sticky for me, a tiny bit filling, but the flavor is so good and fresh it keeps me sipping quickly. i was extremely impressed with everything fiddlehead had going on my recent vermont trip, just blown away how far they have come in a year. 916 charactersStonedTrippin, Aug 18, 2014

Huge resinous dank pine aromas with specks of fruitiness and grains of bread. Damn that smells incredible. Light golden color with a huge fluffy beige head that persists and stickies everything in sight. Big peach tropical pine resinous earthy hop flavors. Faint bready maltiness deep underneath. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation with a resinous bubbly mouthfeel. Wow another great DIPA from Vt what the hell is going up there?

Deep apricot orange with a booming creamy bleach white head.  Good staying power with a two and a half finger head, island Puck and ring like lacing.  Excellent looker.
Hop angle seems to go to an earth and floral sweetness.  Slightly closed a bit too.  Some sticky darkness comes later.
Real basic and real solid palate.  Almost velvet and creamed mouthfeel but sits back a bit.  Mid palate takes no surprises from the nose.  Earth rich hop in the middle a bit of spruce like pine too.  Finishes clean and mouthwash fresh, almost minty but going with a green herb quality.
Pretty solid brew and well controlled IPA.  Also a real nice distinct one for Vermont too 727 characterssmakawhat, Aug 12, 2014

Overall - Awesome beer one of the smoothest IPAs I have ever had. 430 charactersTobes181, Aug 01, 2014

A-Pours a cloudy orange color. Sample too smalle to really comment on the head or lacing.
S-Big, verbose hoppy aroma. Fits right in line with all the other exceptional Vermont born hoppy beers. Juicy tropical fruit with an empaphasis on citrus. Specifically noticed mango and melon.
T-Holds par with the nose. A big bite into a ripe mango slice. Fresh cut grass and oranges. Other intense tropical fruit flavors. Finishes with a sweet, candied citrus flavor.
M-Resiny. Has some nice body to it. Well carbonated. Bitterness lingers.
O-Yeah, Fiddlehead just jumped into the ring at the battle royale of VT hop bombs. Wish I could have gotten my hands on some cans! 696 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 22, 2014

Smell is very tropical mango, tangerine, pine, and grapefruit.
Taste follows the nose perfectly, loads citrus up front, with piney grapefruit finish.
Body is on the large side, perfect amount of carbonation, not really dry, and way to easy drinking.

Golden-amber in appearance. Smells like a hop avalanche is about to smash into my mouth. And it does. Quite bitter, very warm, tasty, and sweet in all the right spots. Smooth despite the hops and alcohol level. 374 charactersLitterbean, Jul 20, 2014

A- Pours a slightly hazy, deep orange hue with about a 1 finger creamy, white head with very little retention. Much more attractive than its other locally canned entity. (4.75)
S- Wow...impressive considering the local competition. Sweet tropical fruit and citrus notes on the nose: mango, pineapple, orange, tangerine, ruby red grapefruit in addition to a subdued pine dankness. (4.75)
T- The malt backbone hits first and helps prepare the palate for the upcoming hop assault. The residual bitterness morphs from citrus rind to pine to an onion/garlic vibe. Well balanced for an unbalanced beer. The 8.2% ABV is very well hidden...actually, undetectable. (4.75)
M- This falls in the category of medium. Creamy carbonation is mild but does the job nicely. (4.75)
O- Definitely another winner for the style. Although comparisons to the local competition will be the norm, I find 2nd Fiddle's aroma and flavor profile to fall much closer to Stone's Enjoy By IPA, another world-class DIPA that people cannot seem to get enough of. That said, hopheads can rejoice with another year-round hop monster being produced in Northern Vermont that has (and will continue) to receive accolades from all that are able to acquire it.

Pours a slightly hazed amber with a thumb of cream colored head. Shhets of lacing , some cloudiness, above average head retention
S: Faint leafy hops, pears, tangerine & breadyness

A- Tallboy can poured to a wide tulip glass for reviewing. Fairly hazy deep orange body with a one finger, frothy white cap. Decent head retention but it falls to a creamy ring with some haze over the middle. Lacing is spotty but some webs also stick to the glass.
S- Dank, tropical fruit and citrus hops jump out of the glass. Notes of melon, mango, tangerine, grapefruit and a slight onion/garlic/earthy hint. Clean overall yeast with just a bit of a malt backing.
T- Citrus and pine hops resonate more here especially with the bitterness present but a solid backing of melons, tangerine, floral and apricot notes are right there with them. Juicy and pulpy with the slightest grain and yeast character to confirm that this is a beer, clean.
MF- Medium bodied brew with a fairly chewy, creamy texture building up on the palate. Carbonation is at a moderate level and does enough to accentuate the hops. Medium bitter finish.
Juicy melons, big citrus and dank. A slightly onion/garlic vibe that is found in many hop bombs but here it is subtle and I even like it personally. Flavorful but doesn't try too hard to assault you with a squeezed nectar of hops. 1,222 characterscbutova, Jun 17, 2014

Appearance - Darkish copper-orange colored pour into a snifter with a finger or so of white head. Good lookin' swirly cap by the end, some decent lace as well.
Smell - Bitter pine, earthy and dank hops stick out most, kind of an onion/veggie vibe, with some grapefruit and pineapple there as well. A light sweet malt presence but mostly hops. 
Taste - A bit more general citrus fruit coming through here, still a big pine and earthy presence as well. A bit more in the way of malts with some caramel and icing sugar, along with bread in the finish. More well-rounded and solid than the scent.
Mouthfeel - Kinda heavy and sticky mouthfeel, good amount of carbonation/foaminess, somewhat high-end bitterness but not overbearing. Hints of alcohol but not much.
Overall - I don't think this is really in the upper echelon of Vermont IPA Greatness, but certainly a good beer all around. 980 charactersChico1985, Jun 01, 2014
4.04/5  rDev -9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 416oz. can courtesy of Ineedabeerhere (thanks Joe!). Served in a tulip nonic. Pours a translucent copper with a tight, quarter inch, bright white head that eventually settles into an oily slick. Some spatters of lacing are present during the tasting. Nose expresses, citrus, piney and flora aromas, with some earthiness towards the back. Taste follows nose; however, the citrus notes are bit less present and the earthy/herbal character is more present in the foreground (I thinking I'm getting Simcoe here). Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Another solid VT DIPA in cans. I tend to gravitate towards the more citrusy end of the spectrum; however, this beer is quite solid. I'd buy this on a regular basis if it was locally available. 788 charactersJwale73, Jun 01, 2014

The most recent I've had from Fiddlehead. Comes out darker than a lot of DIPAs, a dark yellow verging on orange with a small white head. Throws off LOTS of juicy, citrusy hop aromas on the aroma, with a slight letdown on the taste. Not that there's not a ton of hop character on the palate -- because there is -- but I think this one smells hoppier and more bitter than it actually is. Slightly too sweet for my taste, as well. In fairness, I was gifted this growler so I can't comment as to the freshness, and going on the carbonation is may have been sitting in the fridge for a few days.
Overall, a great DIPA. I don't think Fiddlehead is quite up to par with the big names in Vermont DIPAs yet, but if they keep improving the way they have over the past couple of years they could be before long. 818 charactersAlanBeerMan, Apr 30, 2014

4.84/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Served from the tap at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT. To put it simply, this is definitely a top echelon IIPA that deserves to be ranked with the the likes of Double Sunshine and Heady Topper.
A - Pours a dark orange hue with a medium, off-white head. Darker than many DIPA's, especially the local VT competition. Very hazy, definitely an unfiltered beer.
S - Spectacular aromas of citrus, tropical fruits, and pine. Malt smells are very subdued. A spectacular example of what a great DIPA should smell like.
T - Just as the nose would imply, lots of citrus upfront, with hints of other tropical fruits and a resinous pine flavor that lingers on the pallet after your swallow. Like the other big vermont-style DIPA's, this beer is very well balanced and not just another hop bomb. The malts aren't too sweet and compliment the hops well.
M - Medium body, tight carbonation, leaves a somewhat juicy feel on the mouth.
O - Definitely a top echelon beer! This deserves to be ranked up there with the other great Vermont DIPA's. I make trips to VT every few months to grab Hill Farmstead, Lawson's, and Heady Topper. Fiddlehead just earned themselves a spot on the rotation. 1,178 characterstoconn, Mar 17, 2014

A - Pours a dark orange hue, almost a copper in some lights. Somewhat darker than many of the DIPA's that I have tried.
S - WOW. The smell is amazing. A huge bomb of hops on the forefront. I could literally sit here and smell this beer all day, but what fun is that.
T - The taste is unreal. Hops, hops and more hops. A massive burst of citra and simcoe hops. Great citrus flavors with a perfectly balanced bitterness. Amazing.
M - Excellent carbonation and extremely drinkable. Great lacing.
O - An amazing beer from FIddlehead. Definitely one of the best DIPA's that I have ever had. So drinkable, it's not funny. Just an all around incredible beer. Seriously. Try it if you get the chance. 752 charactersRheaume17, Nov 23, 2013
4.6/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This VT crafted DIPA is fantastic and I for one honestly don't see why this underrated on BA. Pours an opaque glowing honey tangerine that just makes me think of a fantastic VT DIPA. My first impression of the smell is straight citra hops with simcoe in the background. Citrusy grapefruit and tangerine jump out and are followed by a nice piney resiny backdrop. Taste is just as the smell would indicate- citrusy grapefruit and tangerine up front (Citra) followed by a piney resinous harmony (Simcoe) that makes this brew sit on my tongue in the most pleasant of ways. I honestly don't pick up on much malt at all which I love and it makes the wonderful hop profile stand out all the more. Even with the lack of a malty backbone this beer is not overpoweringly bitter in the least and I must tip my hat to fiddlehead on this one. Truly a hop forward beer and one that I believe should be getting more praise and by no means plays a second fiddle to any DIPA in the area. Strongly reccomended!!! 994 characters80x2HopHead, Nov 22, 2013
3.85/5  rDev -13.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 2 |  overall: 3.5Let me preface by saying that I was very excited to get a chance to try this at the brewery. I am very much a fan of Fiddlehead and think they are the premier under the radar brewery in Vermont right now. And, being a big fan of their last DIPA, Mastermind, I thought I'd love this as well.
A: Dark orange, clearly filtered.
S: Citrusy hops and malt, pleasant.
T: Good malt and hop balance. Pleasantly bitter. Rather well done.
M: Here's the problem. I'm not sure if I got a bad fill or what, but my growler filled same day was completely flat which, honestly, took away from the taste. It's undoubtedly a well done beer, but I can't seem to get past the fact that I spent $8 for two flat pints. I'd be open to trying it again, but I'd taste it first to ensure that it's carbonated.
O: Well done for sure with one fatal flaw: carbonation. If you get the chance to try it--a rarity for sure--I suggest you do. Just keep in mind this experience. Fiddlehead, despite this, is among my favorite breweries and I will continue to patronize them until they give me a reason not to. This is not that reason, just a speed bump. 1,123 charactersBTVflatlander, Nov 20, 2013

4.69/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Wow!!! This is spectacular stuff. Picked up a 4-pack at the brewery. Packaged on 12/18 so it's only a few days old. Beautiful golden-copper color with a fluffy white head. What really shines with this beer is how pleasantly fruity and slighty sweet the hops are. Incredible flavor lingers on the palate without being cloying. I'm very happy there are three more cans to enjoy. 376 charactersGatch, Jul 22, 2013
