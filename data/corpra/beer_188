Nose takes you down two roads.  Fresh and acidic/preserved cherries and raspberries and ice cream come through.  Alongside, dandelions, hay, Brett, and tart apple.  Fruit is amazing compared to Rose de Gambrinus.  I think this will be my first ever 5 for nose.  Flavor has acidity and intensity of straight raspberry juice paired with funky lemon peel and a fresh herbal greenery that is hard to place.  Almost like an intense mixed drink.   Prickly crisp carbonation.  Funky monkey this is a good beer, even compared to other Cantillon beers.  Honestly, the intensity will make this 750 ml bottle an all afternoon affair. 740 characterscaptaincoffee, Mar 18, 2017

Reluctant to rate because this is such a distinctive beer, at once subtle and strong, and this is the first time I've had anything by Cantillon.  I found it amazing, but also palate challenging.  It's kind of like first time listening to Coltrane.  You're not sure how to describe it or judge it, and you're at once thrilled and in over your head, but you know repetition seems really worth pursuing and will alter your tastes. 456 charactersprofessorchow, Dec 26, 2016

That was EXTREME, could feel the smell from the bottle and the off flavors here were kind of unpleasant in the first 15-20 minutes. The funk was so strong we couldnt have the first sip, and i'm not talking about horsey aromas but some kind of fishey/rotten food/mold and more. After waiting for the beer to get warmer the aromas morphed into something more fruity and the framboise finally came up. Very very sour on the palate, mid carbonation. What an experience this was, scary and amazing! 506 charactersDispyDnb, Dec 10, 2016

Slight earthy funk under huge sweet raspberry - tart notes of cassis and a hint of vanilla. 
Tart and funky, but not very sour; typically balanced between earthy funk and bold fruit. A touch sweet with masses of raspberry crushing all

4.74/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752012 sticker date. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Cantillon stemmed lambic glass. Allowed to warm to just under room temperature over 3 hours. 
Pours a maroon body with a pretty big, 3 finger light pink, fizzy head that dissipates pretty quickly to leave no retention or lacing. 
Wow.. the aromas on this baby are mesmerizing - a huge wave of fresh raspberries fills the air. So much fruit here. Light funk and oak on the aromas but fresh, bright berries dominate. 
On the tongue, it starts with fresh, sour raspberry juice notes.. really delicate but pronounced. This gives way to a good amount of oak, lactic sourness, earthy light funk, finishing crisp, clean, acidic, tannic almost. Ever so slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is fantastic - medium carbonation, and medium light, easy drinking body. 
I can see why the Lou Pepe series is sought after, these beers are true masterpieces. I wouldn't say this beer is overly COMPLEX, being pretty fresh the berries dominate, but that's exactly why it's so great. World class. 1,023 charactersgcamparone, Oct 01, 2016

With Zwanze coming up and me never having had a Cantillon Framboise other than Rose, I decided to pull out this old bottle. I still haven't had the LP fresh, but maybe I'll score one of the latest batch for comparison. Dark mahogany color, with a fluffy off-white head that settled down after a few minutes. Aroma was full of funk and cobwebs, with the fruit present but a bit muted. Yeasty funk up front in the taste, old lambic goodness, with berry skin/seeds. Fruit was perhaps somewhat faded at this point (again, I never had this fresh), but still very present. Tartness/acidity was mellow, no vinegar here at all. Dry and lightly woody. Very good overall. 695 charactersRifugium, Sep 14, 2016

Slightly hazy, red/amber appearance.  This has to be the strangest beer I have ever smelled.  Extremely complex which is difficult to describe.  Raspberry is definitely present on the nose, but there is this funky aroma that is overpowered by all kinds of notes.  Just very strange.  The taste doesn't follow the nose as much.  That funk is still there but raspberry sour, other red fruits, almond, nutmeg, barnyard hay, funky cheese.... it's all somehow blended perfectly.  Oaky for sure!  The aftertaste is smooth with light carbonation/fizzy feel.  Could sip on this beer all day long and enjoy every sip.  But I simply could not stop smelling the beer.  Probably took 2-3 whiffs for every sip. 732 characterseifster82, Aug 14, 2016

Rich, complex, pungent, but never off putting or abrasive. This has every aspect of funk I've tasted in a beer - dank wet hay, barnyard, funky cheese, and much more than my meager palate can take in. The raspberries are still there. They don't get overpowered, but the funk takes center stage. The appearance and mouth feel are on point. This is an amazing beer. 426 charactersdanh53, Jun 24, 2016

It looks amazing. When I think of framboise or raspberry sours, this is how I want them to look. I want them to look like LPF or RdG. That bright pinkish, purple, magenta. LPF has the looks that kill. The looks may be the highlight, though. Lou Pepe Framboise is really acidic. There is very little balance and the raspberries are overwhelmed by the acidity. After a while, my enamel started hurting from drinking this.  I can't say I didn't enjoy this, but man, is it harsh. 511 charactersSheppard, Jun 08, 2016

Lou Pepe Framboise is to a double-pound cheeseburger what Rosé De Gambrinus would be to a quarter-pounder; both delight and amaze in their own right, but one is definitely a richer more intense version of the other. 
An abundance of raspberry on the nose, with the good ol' barnyard funk we've come to expect and love from the magic of the River Senne. Lots of tart, dark berry, and even a little bit of oak emerge from the bottle once the cork comes off; a sour lemon-y residue lingers while the bottle decants.
Sour isn't usually my go-to response with Framboise, but it is in this case. The nose is wonderfully matched on the tongue as well, as funky sour hay flavors quickly follow the tart dark fruit. I'd even dare to say that the berry flavor is closer to cranberry than it is to raspberry; remind me to mix this with vodka if I ever find myself holding an excess supply. 941 charactersamano_h, Jan 04, 2016

Anyways, I ordered a bottle of LPF at the Public Brewing Session. 2012 bottle. Served in a Lambic basket into their stemmed taster glasses. LPF pours a deeper red than Rose de Gambrinus, but lighter than Kriek (I don't know about LPK). It's a deeper pink, compared to a deeper red of Kriek. There was about half an inch of head on my pour, but my buddy got even more on his. Smelled like a wonderful raspberry bomb with the sourness/funk classic of Lambics, so I hear. The taste is wonderful. At the time, I described it as more of everything than Rose de Gambrinus. More raspberry, more carbonation, more enjoyable (not to discredit Rose). The mouthfeel of this is definitely more bubbly, which I loved. Glad I have three of these to take home and enjoy with my family and throw in the cellar. A must taste at some point in one's beer drinking career. 1,030 charactersMatthewWalters, Nov 16, 2015

Nose is straight Cantillon funk with massive raspberries.  Taste is better than I could have ever expected, definitely the funkiest, sourest, and most well balanced Loon I have had.  The raspberry and funk just do not stop.  Mouthfeel is bubbly heaven.  So glad I traded for this older bottle and it knocked '14 Framboos out of the water in side by side tasting. 627 charactersAndyEdgar, Oct 19, 2015

Poured a very nice burgundy color with minimal amount of head. 
Nose was that typical Cantillion funk with a ton of fresh tart raspberries. 
Flavor followed the nose. 
Prickly, tart mouthfeel, but not mouth puckering. 
Enjoyed the LPF a lot more than the LPK. Although the 100% Bio Kriek is equally as good and much easier to obtain. 358 charactersHoppyBastard1, Sep 23, 2015

Pours a very saturated, burgundy red color, with a soon disappating, fizzy head. 
Exhibit a fantastic smelling nose, with a very pronounced raspberry presence, blending perfectly into the tart acidity of the beer, establishing a reminiscence of young berries and young, fermented wine. Barnyard funk mingles together with prickly raspberry stones, tied together by a sweet, fruity undertone, exhibiting a gentle depth to the aromas. 
Has a medium carbonation and a very soft mouthfeel, with raspberry at every stage of drinking.
Tastes of unripe raspberries right from the beginning, wrapped up in leaves, moldy earth and tart funk - wild berries on an abandoned road during rain. This changes, as an earthy sweetness adds to the raspberries spending them a ripe note, including prickly, still sour stones. This fruity sweetness then stays on par with the bitterness on the palate till the finish, with the berries exhibiting a dusty earth note anong ripened, slightly fermented raspberry pulp, leaving behind a slick sourness.
The balance between ripe and young, sour raspberries, finding their quintessence in between, makes this beer noteworthy, featuring a lot of subtle Barnyard nuances. 1,228 charactersaleigator, May 30, 2015

Sour fruit, dirty socks, etc.  More sour and less sweet than Lindemans, for example.
The brewers seem disappointed that most people prefer the more fruit-forward "Lou Pepe" versions, but it makes sense to me -- the Lou Pepe versions will really make you pucker with the sour fruit. 354 characterscfalls, Jan 20, 2015

What a treat. This pours vibrant red with a minimal head but decent effervescence. The nose is a beautiful balance between neutral oak, raspberries, sour yeast, and cherries. The taste is right in line with the nose. Moderate level of tartness. Moderate carbonation, fairly thin, moderate smoothness. 
This is not sweet or syrupy. This has a strong raspberry flavor that is tight in line with the tart level and influence from the barrel. Another home run from Cantillon. 548 charactersmacher0, Jan 02, 2015

4.77/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle purchased at AJ's in Henrietta, NY, and shared last night.
Pours a rich medium red color, with visible active carbonation, a fizzy head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells so richly and strongly of raspberry, it just leaps out of the glass, with some must, funk, vinegar, and oak.
This an absolutely delicious framboise. Huge fresh raspberry character, as I'd expect out of a 2014 bottle. Raspberry flesh, raspberry skin, and raspberry seeds all come to mind when drinking this- I also get lactic acid, a little bit of funk, and a little bit of oak. It's sour, but not overwhelmingly so, keeping it very easy to drink.
This has a medium bodied, slightly thin- not to its detriment, it is a sour after all- with a tart and crisp mouthfeel, and a higher amount of carbonation. Very drinkable, very crushable, even if you don't want to.
As I finally get to try more Cantillon, I seem to understand the allure of sours more and more. This one was so good. 963 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 01, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A fruit beer executed to near perfection. With the taste of raspberry locked intact, the supporting ale celebrates the berry's bright flavor, its zesty acidity, and its crisp and refreshing taste in ideal fashion; and does so without backing down either.
Delightfully mauve-pink in color, the lightly carbonated ale carries a vibrant tawny appearance and simply glistens in the glass. The bright acidity of raspberry, rose wine, cork and burlap offers the nose a racy fruit scent that's contrasted by equal parts earth and rusticity.
As the beer hits the tongue, the palate is taken back by the beer's acute acidity that plays out above the modest lingering sweetness of fructose and wafer-thin malt. Slim on hops, the slight malt starch supports the beer's impressive sourness and its delicate brine without much interference in taste. Without being overly vinegar, or of lime, or of barnyard funk or game, the sourness is potent but elegant and refined.
Its light body is both softened with carbonation but is also given a sprite effervescent that springs from the tongue like brut champagne. Acidity strips the thirst from the palate and ushers in a high rate of refreshment and drinkability that outweighs its intense raspberry sourness. With an afterglow of fruit, wheat, cork and white pepper. 1,302 charactersBEERchitect, Dec 26, 2014

2011 Sticker, poured into a wine stem glass.
Beautiful fresh raspberry smell accompanies a light bodied raspberry colored beer with a 1/4 inch white foam head that recedes back into the glass.
Classic Cantillon funk on the back end of the nose and as it warms a bit.
Taste follows the nose here with tart raspberries that have a very natural taste. Freshly squeezed and pressed raspberries with a tart dry finish.
Mouthfeel is light and perfect for the style. 
This is easier to obtain than other top tier Frams, or Black Raz, Rasp, blackberry wilds/gueuzes/sours.
It holds up with the best of them. Seek this one out with confidence 675 charactersdrmcleod10, Nov 22, 2014

Appearance is deep pinkish ruby red with pencil thin white head. Head dissipates quickly and the aroma of fresh raspberry immediately takes over. Taste is like fresh squeezed raspberry, not overly sweet with nice dry, sour finish . There is also a nice complex funk throughout. Mouthfeel is near perfect with slight carbonation. 
Overall this beer is really remarkable and did not disappoint. I've had a few batches of Atrial, Lolita, Rosé De Gambrinus, Upland, etc which are all great but the complex layers of this beer really shine and push it slightly above the other raspberry sours. Definitely seek this out.

Thanks man! 2010 Sticker on this one pours bright red with a mostly white with a pink hued read on top. Aroma of barnyard funk, yeast, hay, dust, and big juicy raspberries. Flavor follows just the same with lots of dusty barnyard funk and plenty of juicy raspberries. Dry oaky finish. Body is light, pretty dry on the finish, and has medium plus carbonation. Oh yea. This is good. Glad I finally got to try it. 503 charactersBMMillsy, Aug 04, 2014

Pours a bright juicy reddish pink with nice clarity and minimal head. The nose is unbelievable. Full of jammy raspberries, a hint of earth, layers of signature Cantillon funk, a hint of vinegar and oak, but mainly ripe fresh berries. I could smell this all day! The taste lives up to the delightful smell with fresh juicy berries, waves of tartness which are counterbalanced with sweetness. Each flavor pops as this is the tastiest lambic I have ever had the pleasure of trying. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, this beer is fantastic. Definitely the best of the loons I have tried and one that I will have to seek out again. 731 charactershomebrew311, Jul 09, 2014

Just ever so slightly disappointing. Not quite the massive fruit bomb of the best year's I've had, nor aged enough to add funky complexity. Still gorgeous, ruby-maroon with fluffy head that lasts. Deep, bold berry notes on the nose and palate, and sharp, lingering, fierce tartness. Clean, overly so in fact. A round, medium body with a crisp finish.
This particular tasting was a fine bottling I'd love to have easy access to, but not something to write home about. 482 characterserrantnight, Jul 03, 2014

Pours deep red, with a hint of amber highlights. Frothy white head that fizzles away quickly. Not much lacing, but a tiny bit of "legs."
Tons of raspberry in the aroma, earthy, musty, and mushroom follow. Oak with barnyard only in the background. Tea and wood mingle with fresh fruit. Musty aged hops.
Juicy raspberries upfront. Clean lactic sourness follows. Oak and brett mingle in as well, but it's mostly about the fruit and sourness. Very very dry.
Moderately heavy carbonation. Super tannic with sourness lingering on the palate.
A fruity, tart, and complex beer. At this age it has a great balance of fruit and lambic character. 653 characterssjccmd, Jun 09, 2014

poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: translucent mediumred bodied beer with massive 3 fingers of white head. Head has some serious staying power and eventually drops down to a thin cap.
Smell: Apple cider vinegar. Loads of juicy raspberries. Light level of funkiness.
Taste: Tons of raspberries! Hints of green apples and lemons. 6/10 on the sour scale. Light musty funk just like in the nose. Bright tasting fruity sour!
Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with moderate carboantion levels. semidry finish. wouldnt chance a think about the mouthfeel. Supurb!

A: Deep pink/red with a light pink head
S: Some dry tart funk and jammy berries, a little bit of yeast
T: I'm tasting 2 very different and pronounced components of this beer both separately and at once. On one hand, you can taste all the qualities of a delicious Cantillon labmic - funky barnyard, grass, with a pretty heavy sourness. One the other hand you can taste super fresh raspberries, maybe the most natural raspberry flavor I've ever encountered in a beer. Together they are phenomenal.
M: Slightly dry, good carb
O: I was very very impressed by this beer! Really fantastic framboise from Cantillon. 660 charactersanteater, Feb 15, 2014

Appearance: Pours a bright ruby red with hints of purple. Less than a finger of a light pink head dissipates quickly to a collar. Body is somewhat clear with light visible carbonation streaming throughout the glass.
Smell: Huge fresh raspberries, oak, hay, barnyard funk, green apple, vinegar acidity. Light musty character present as well and intensifies as the beer warms, but probably still a little lighter than a typical Cantillon.
Taste: Tart juicy raspberries, basement, oak tannins. Hugely tart, almost mouth puckering, tart finish. 
Mouthfeel: Light bodied, with low/medium levels of spritzy carbonation. Super smooth and drinkable. Nearly perfect.
Overall: Not surprisingly, this is another winner from Cantillon. Huge fresh, jammy raspberry with tartness and funk that are strong enough to add additional complexity without overwhelming the fruit character. Best raspberry lambic, and possibly best fruit lambic of any kind that I've had. Definitely worth seeking out. 1,032 charactersJonada, Jan 28, 2014

A - gorgeous light red with hint of pink in color. Aggressively dissipated carbonation. 
S - that prototypical Cantillon funk comes at you right out of the box. Bright raspberry, currant and cherries. 
T - big raspberry and mild funk. Just a pure and total expression of the style. 
M - nice carbonation. Great interplay of sweetness and acidity. Flawless balance. 
O - without a doubt, the best framboise I've ever had. Rose de Gambrinus is a great beer and this one is just like RDG, but on steroids. 520 charactersEliotRosewater, Dec 30, 2013

Intensely fruity aroma. Massive raspberry and raspberry seed aroma coming out of this 7 year old vintage. Funky too. Complex with fruity, tart and earthy notes. Big.
Massive tart funkiness but not powerfully acidic. Just rounded acidity that plays off the raspberry flavour and aroma. Interesting lemon note. Low barnyard flavours but the fruitiness really makes this a winner.
Medium-light body with moderately-high carbonation. Super.
An excellent beer in the finest Cantillon style. The Lou Pepe range truly is the pinnacle of what they produce. The even rarer stuff is hardly worth the effort compared to this sublime product. 707 charactersdgilks, Dec 29, 2013
4.88/5  rDev +9.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Cantillon Lou Pepe Framboise is perhaps the most classic and refined beer I've ever tried - but it has the colour of a Swedish Berry candy, the glossiness of nail polish, and looks flamboyant enough to be singing a Liza Minnelli tune. Even its head is hot pink.
This has a smell reminiscent of a dank, musty basement - the fruitiest, most perfumed and agreeable wet basement you'll ever come across. There's a strong whiff of oak wood but most of all there's the wild yeasts and trademark bacteria of the Senne Valley. It's a scent unique to Brussels and, more specifically, one that can instantly be traced back to Cantillon.
Jean Van Roy - pick your generation - is a prolific father; others have carried on his sour, wild yeast and barrel-aging lineage, but Lou Pepe Framboise reminds us "who's your daddy". Nothing is this distinctly funky, obviously fermented *and* friendly. The extra dosage of fruit doesn't distract from the sour Lambic but increases the subtle flavour present in the Rosé De Gambrinus. 
One is always kept aware of the old oak barrels in which this beer is aged (minimum of two years in Lou Pepe's case). As is virtually always the case with every Fruit Lambic Cantillon brews, the contents of the wood are as apparent as (or arguably more than) the fruit. This thing has a shot of lemon juice with every mouthful; very sour but also, in a huge way, very refreshing. 
Of all the dozens of Lambics I've reviewed on my home (North American) turf, none have recaptured and recalled the charm, character and cuisine of Belgium - at least those elements that I've always taken away from it - better than Lou Pepe Framboise. Each trip to Brussels is relived with every sip. It is a dazzling beer and easily one of the more memorable ones I've tried. 1,774 charactersbiegaman, Dec 29, 2013

Rose colored head, very small bubbles, you can *hear* the dissipation on this champagne like beer. Interesting raspberry aroma, not a big fruity nose, but rather delicate, masks the funky horseblanket notes from this 2010 vintage. Taste is certainly on the tart not sour side, pronounced yet not heavy berry notes, enough funk to keep your interest, nice balance with the raspberries. Mouthfeel on the light side, delicate, huge effervescent mouthfeel. Wow. Beer of the Gods. The exemplar of the style. 675 charactersjdense, Nov 07, 2013

I felt it was wrong to just "had" this gem, and I didn't have anything to write with at the time since I was just going out for dinner and not expecting something so fantastic to be there. Shared this w/ Skrip and another friend at a random place in VT that had it for on site consumption only. The words may be less descriptive than usual since it's from memory, but I the numbers should be spot on because I have pics for appearance, and remember how great it smelled/tasted/felt overall!
2010 vintage
A- Pours a GORGEOUS raspberry pink/red that just glows in the glass! Very minimal head that recedes quickly, leaving little to no lacing. Good carbonation can be seen.
S- My God, this smells fantastic! Super fruity and tart. Raspberries, sour green apples, very light vinegar/acidic smell. It all just explodes out of the glass, beckoning you to take a sip!
T- The taste follows the nose nearly to a T. The sour/tartness is not overwhelming, but it's right there in your face from the start, and leaves a puckering sour snap in the finish. Perhaps not as much raspberries as I'd like, and a bit more vinegar than preferred, but these are minor complaints. There's plenty of oak/tannic character. Not super complex, but delicious!
M- The feel was well carbonated and quite good for the style as it went down smooth, but again with that smack of sour in the finish. The oak yields a mellow feel as well.
O- Overall this was a pleasure to drink. The aroma was top notch, and the taste could stand up to many of the best sours out there. I'm taking off a little extra just because as it warmed a bit past cellar temp (which is what it was served at) the flavor dropped off slightly and became more vinegary (which I don't necessarily mind much, but it took over the raspberries, which I feel are meant to be featured). 1,891 charactersSadMachine, Sep 28, 2013

Looking like an unblended and certainly not a rich looking as LP Kriek. Aroma of raspberry preserves, bright grapefruit, true Cantillon subtle funk, fresh berry yogurt. Taste is very sour, bitter citrus for balance, lemon yogurt, woody tannins, lots of geuze character more than just raspberry. The base lambic here is center stage. Mouth watering all the way. Lactic sour palate devastation. Super wet mouthfeel. 1/11/2011 8/4/8/5/16=4.1
750mL 2001 ed thanks again to ygtbsm94. Pours a fire amber red with an excellent pink head that is extremely healthy for a sour albeit a little fizzy. Aroma is unreal: so much fresh raspberry, raspberry preserves, and insanely sharp funk. Taste is sharp, ultimate level of lactic acidity, seedy raspberries, rhubarb, sorrel, and starchy earth. Palate is all consuming, zippy, dry, insanely powerful but quick on your body. What a complete devastation of the framboise category. I cannot believe it but Puzzl and others are right- there is some serious aging potential for krieks and framboise. This has become sharper and more fruity heavy with 10 years on it rather than more mellow. 2/12/2011 9/4/8/5/16=4.2 1,240 characterstarheels86, Sep 25, 2013

A: Vibrant, deep pinkish red. Gorgeous pinkish hue on the finger or so of head.
S: Fresh picked raspberries. That wonderful lambic acidity, funk, a bit of mustiness. Sour, funky and tannic.
T: Raspberries are prevalent. Like biting into a slightly overripe berry. I need to check my teeth for seeds. Great balance of acidity, fruit jammy-ness, oak tannin and just the right touch of funk. The freshest, most prevalent fruit character I've ever experienced in a sour beer.
M: Effervescent, smooth and superbly drinkable. Puckering and refreshing all at once.
O: Incredible. I tend to prefer fruited sours and this might be the best one I've ever had. The raspberry character is just incredible. I'm thankful I have another bottle. 786 charactersvonnegut21, Sep 15, 2013

Deep dark red, nearly cherry, but just a touch of pink with a good thick collar that stays of pink bubbles.
The bouquet on the Lou Pepe is the perfect match of sweetness and tartness balanced, with perhaps the light funk and acid edging out just nicely enough. Sweet raspberry with a moderate funk kick. Hints of lemon also seem to burst out as well.
Palate comes with less funk and acid than expected. Fruit forward raspberries with a very light palate. Great mixture of sweet and tartness, but the acid and raspberry sensing sourness is predominant. Light pepper finish, with some hinting sweetness as well.
Overall a great example of a framboise of a different nature. Surprising example of what sweet and sour can accomplish in a beer. 833 characterssmakawhat, Sep 15, 2013

A-Pours a beautiful reddish pink. The color is deep and concentrated. Tiny, pinkish head. Very beautiful.
S-Aroma is excellent. Jammy, ripe raspberry. Also there is an abundance of tart raspberry. Sweet and sour all in one. The raspberry is rich and layered. There is also a pleasant oakiness. Another cool component of the nose is this earthy, pungent 'terroir' like aroma. Great aroma.
T-The flavor does not disappoint. The jammy raspberry is big and rich. The tartness is set perfectly. Raspberry flavor like nothing I have come across before. Sweet and sour perfection. The earthy 'terroir' component really sets this beer apart. Oak seals the deal.
M-Puckering and light bodied with tickling bubbles. Tannic. A bit sticky.
O/D-Easily my favorite Framboise. The depth of flavor is impeccable. I was super excited to try this and it blew me away. A delicious beer. Must try the other Lou Pepe brews. 925 charactersVelvetExtract, Sep 14, 2013

A- Pours a deep cherry-raspberry red, translucent, just a faint off-white pinkish head forms that recedes to a flat top.
S- Lots of fresh raspberries, some slight raspberry purée, some slight underlying funk that's hidden underneath the raspberries. Fruity presence is very nice.
T- Fresh raspberries, a nice acidic bite that isn't too vinegary, finishes with nice funky lambic qualities of some pepper, barnyard funk, and a tiny bit of hay. Awesome balance.
M- Very drinkable, nice acidity level, nice amount of carbonation.
O- Cantillon really knows oohs to make their lambics, I prefer the LP Kriek slightly over this but both are incredible. I'd like to try this with some more age as I think the funk would come out a bit more while still blending nicely with the cherries. Not the easiest bottle to get (at least in e US), but definitely worth trying if you can. 977 charactersjaasen64, Sep 14, 2013

A - Pours raspberry red with a nice one finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving spotty trails of lace down part of the glass.
S - Smells of intense basement must and barnyard funk and not much else. Not a ton of fresh fruit which is a bit surprising with such a fresh bottle but it is still enjoyable.
T - Starts off with the strong must and funk combo that never really fades away. The raspberries come through a little more here but they are still more muted than I was expecting. Finish is still pretty musty with some lingering tartness. Not overly sour like some of the aged bottles I have had, but not as bright with the fruit either.
M - Medium-Light body with moderately high carbonation. The spritzy feel propels the musty, tart flavors across the palate. 
O - My first time having this one fresh and it was interesting. I was expecting a lot more fruit than I got from it, mostly the trademark Cantillon musty funk combo but that is fine as well. Probably my least favorite of the three Lou Pepe's but still a beer worth seeking out. 1,142 charactersorangesol, Aug 28, 2013

Ruby red - bright, with pink hues. The LP Framboise is beyond jammy - its exploding with sweet and tart berry with a seedy finish. Acetic, musty, vinegar, moderate tartness.

Binny's Orland
Lou Pepe Framboise glimmers a brilliant ruby red in my oversized flute. Faded orange highlights the body near the stem of the glass. A pink tinted head snaps to attention at over a finger in height before fizzling down to a skim coat. The collar is rather thick and leaves behind thin sheet lacing. The color of this beer is amazing.
Ahhh...Cantillon! That incredible Cantillon funk is present in all it's glory. Crazy amounts of mustiness cradle every other aspect of the nose and there's a bracing green raspberry and vinegar sourness that instantly makes my mouth water uncontrollably. A mild but interesting floral quality sneaks up along with a touch of Sweet Tart sweetness. I could happily take deep whifs of this beer all night long.
Each drink is cheek puckeringly sour. Green, underripe raspberries get things moving and they're as musty as ever. A Sweet Tart candy like sweetness comes across mid palate while trying to balance out the sourness and falling miserably short. Dusty, funkiness runs throughout this entire beer. Another absolutely delicious Cantillon. The raspberry seems to ripen up as this warms.
A light body combines with the puckering sourness that I get used to halfway through the glass. The carbonation is tiny and somewhat prickly. It does a great job of scrubbing the tongue clean after each drink. 
Drinkability is off the charts. The acidity will bring along the heartburn but it's worth it for a beer of this caliber. The light body and refreshing sourness make this bottle disappear far too quickly.
Lou Pepe Framboise is another gem of a beer coming from Cantillon. Great raspberry flavor and great sourness. I won't be drinking this often because of the price tag but it will be in the rotation from now on.

Appearance: Pours a brilliant, clear, gorgeous, blood red. Generous two-finger foamy head that is a light pink color. No lace in the glass
Smell: Freshly smashed raspberries on a bright summer day. A slight musty basement-like aroma. Hint of lengthy oak aging subtlety blends into the background. Acetic vinegar. Ends with a touch of funk.
Taste: The taste bursts with a cascading waterfall of acetic vinegar. Just the right amount of fresh raspberry sweetness cuts into the vinegar and provides a perfect balance. You'll swear you can taste the musty basement, but not in a bad way. It's very complex and has layers of flavor. There's a lot going on here that is difficult for my palette to discern, but rest assured it's world-class.
Mouthfeel: A low, effervescent carbonation paired with a light-body. It is wet and refreshing as it glides gracefully around the mouth. The finish on this Lou Pepe Framboise is incredible as the flavor just seems to last forever.
Overall: What an incredible drinking experience. This Cantillon is world-class, near-perfection of what a fruited, funky sour should be. I'm thoroughly excited to try my Lou Pepe Kriek's and might even hang onto my 2009 Lou Pepe Gueuze. 1,307 charactersClonies720, Aug 03, 2013

Pour is as described, a big, bubbly pot of light red or purplish soda. Very, very big on the carbonation. Nose is a delightful melange of berries and light tartness. 
Lou Pepe Framboise kicks some butt on tap like I have not experienced out of the old hip flask...or bottle. Lively fresh raspberries are juxtaposed with a lovely dose of smart, sharp tartness that never touches sour. Effervescent enough that I feel the bubbles pressing eagerly all the way up into my long-shattered sinuses. Dry but oh, oh-so drinkable. I'd work in farm fields for a jug of this with dinner.

Poured out of a lambic basket into Cantillon stemmed wine glasses, 7/5/2013. Drank this one after drinking a 2010 Lou Pepe Kriek.
Pours a lovely red-pink body, with a nice fluffy 2cm pink head with good retention. Not a ton of lacing to be seen. The colour on this is very similar to that of the Lou Pepe Kriek. I love how fruity and glowing these beers' colours look.
Smells like straight up fresh raspberries with a ton of that musty Cantillon brewery funk and hay, accompanied by a nice dose of vinegar acidity. Although, like the other beers I'm drinking on premises, I can't promise that its because I'm drinking it at the actual brewery which smells like that. Its a great combination regardless. 
Drinking this beer yields a crapload of raspberry fruit flavour along with a strong, delicious acetic sourness that has some oak barrel components. In the background is some earthy funk, leather and horseblanket. But the raspberries are definitely not missed here, and the acetic sourness is just perfect. Unlike the Rosé de Gambrinus, this big brother version is more complex with more of that earthiness in the background with a more complex acetic sour flavour.
Fizzly, great carbonation, actually a bit thinner bodied compared to Lou Pepe Kriek. So easy to drink, and I was able to down most of this bottle on my own. No hints of alcohol which is no surprise.
I really enjoyed this one. This is beyond better than Rosé, as it is more complex while being more fruity and brings out the other flavours of the brewing process very well. Still, raspberries don't provide as much complexity as the cherries do in the corresponding Krieks. I prefer Lou Pepe Kriek to this, but this is still an absolute delight to drink. 1,822 charactersStevedore, Jul 07, 2013

VIntage 2010
Bottled 3 June 2013
300g per liter
APPEARANCE: Pours a small, off-white, light red head with decent retention. Clear poppy red in color with almost no carbonation evident. Head fades quickly and it looks almost flat in the glass rather quickly. Pretty color, though I wish the head made more of an impression. 
SMELL: Lots of raspberries on the nose, with tart lemons, some funk, and just a hint of acidity. Slightly one dimensional, though the raspberries are quite lovely. 
TASTE: Raspberries up front with tart lemon sourness and oak notes at the swallow. Bold and lingering finish of tart lemon, sweet-sour raspberries, some funky flavors and wood from the barrels. A hint of bitterness finds its way through too. Well balanced between the sour lambic and tart, sweet red fruits. 
PALATE: Medium body and modest carbonation. Creamy and fuller on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes dry and puckering. A touch of acidity lingers. Good feel here. 
OVERALL: This is really nice. Lots of good fruit flavor with a solid lambic as a base, and a full, creamy feel to support the show. Well balanced and very flavorful. The look was a little lack-luster, though we can forgive that for sure. Good stuff and well worth checking out. Recommended. 1,333 charactersJeffo, Jul 06, 2013

Reviewed from notes taken on St. Patrick's Day standing up in a crowded bar, so bear with me. Expectations were sky high given the brewery's reputation and my love for sours. 
A: Pours a one finger head of pnk colour. Fair cream and thickness. Retention is average (~3+ minutes). Body is a vibrant understated rich red. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. 
Sm: Tart raspberry. Acidic fruit skin. Bacteria/wild yeast. A mild strength aroma. Clean and tart, with surprisingly mild sourness. 
T: Tart sourness. Lactic. Fantastic tart raspberry fruit. Clean unobtrusive malt foundation. Crystal malt lends a champagne like note. Balance is perfect. It's a simple sour, but a good one. Contained tart lactic sourness. Not real puckerworthy, but damn tasty. Great subtlety. Really good. 
Mf: Clan, smooth, and wet. Perfect carbonation. Crisp. Near perfect. Feels custom-tailored to the flavour profile. Tart and bubbly/fizzy from the crystal malt. 
Dr: Quite drinkable. Hides ABV well. It's exactly what you want in a sour. Incredibly tasty and enjoyable. Damn good for the style, but I wouldn't trade for it. Best purchased for cheap in Belgium; it's overpriced here. Glad I got to try it for a special occasion; it wouldn't be worth the pricetag elsewise.

Pours a wonderful red color with excellent clarity. A small pink tinted head forms and has pretty nice retention and lacing for a lambic.
A wonderful but intensely funky aroma from the brett. Lots of lactic sourness and of course, a huge raspberry smell. A touch of oak in the background as well (something that adds to the complexity of the Lou Pepe beers)
This is one of the best things that has ever entered my mouth. Lots of complex, funky flavors. Medium high sourness, huge raspberry flavor, a touch of vanilla. Musty, earthy, fruity. Dry but still rich thanks to all the complex flavors. 
As someone who loves raspberries, this is the best Cantillon beer I've tried. Phenomenal. 773 charactersDanny1217, May 12, 2013

4.31/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25On cask at Moeder Lambic on 4/7/2013. Pours a beautiful raspberry hue, slightly hazy in clarity, with a fluffy, cloud-like, light pink head similar to the color of cotton candy. Nose expresses citrus, rind, cork and a wisp of raspberry essence at the back. Taste consistent with nose - no real surprises here. Citric acid is very assertive in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body, puckeringly tart and lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a very good fruit lambic; however, I'd like to have had a little more raspberry flavor. 548 charactersJwale73, Apr 15, 2013

As soon as the cork is pulled, the aroma of raspberries wafts into the room. Poured into a tulip, has a lovely pinkish garnet color, transparent, clear on the first pour, a little cloudy on the second. A half inch head of light foam, quickly dissipates to a ring. Some motile lacing quickly runs down the glass back into the ring of foam and does not stick. 
Nose is fresh raspberry, old wood and spice, a little Cantillon funk, and a mild acetic acid (vinegar) note. Main impression is a glass of macerated raspberries. 
This tastes of fresh raspberries upfront with some raspberry juice sweetness, then the acetic acid hits mid palate and continues to get more acidic towards the finish, which is pretty sour at that point. I love the fresh raspberry flavor, even in this 5 year old version. 
Body is light with some slight carbonation, flat mouthfeel. Has a clean presentation with no stickiness. Unfortunately, the carbonation leaves too quickly. 
This beer preserves the fresh acidity of the raspberry and enhances that some with an extra vinegar sourness--but a little too much. The malt notes are light and the old wood notes, spice, and tannins add some complexity. Definitely a great beer, but the sour level makes me want to have it with food, which it pairs well with. My goal is to try this again as fresh as possible to guage how much of the fruit has left this bottle after cellaring.
Vintage 2008, bottled 29 September, 2010
Update: The following day, I opened the 2008 vintage bottled in 2010. This has a deeper red color and the raspberry flavor is slightly fresher with a much lower acetic acid level that did not produce the wave of acidity I experienced with the 2006 and is better carbonated with a more champagne-like mouthfeel. I could enjoy sipping a whole bottle of this vintage, which is what I am about to do :-). Because the 2008 vintage presents considerably better, I have upgraded my earlier score to an across the board 4.75 (was 4.5 overall). With these beers, one can expect variations by vintage (neither the lambic nor the fruit will be the same) and quality also depends on cellaring time and conditions, but 2008 is delicious now and may be as good as it gets (until I get to try a newer vintage). 2,271 charactersBeerenauslese, Apr 15, 2013

4.43/5  rDev -0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Double imported Cantillon. 2002 Vintage, with a 2004 printed on the cork. Bottled and imported from Belgium first by Belgian Beer Paradise, then bought in Brazil and sent to America in 2012. Now it's ready to drink in 2013. Let's hope the cork works with me. Coming out of a 750 ml bottle, on to the beer:
The cork is a little mushy, but I am able to put the cork opener into it without having it fall apart. Pull out, pour into a glass, get a muddy brownish pink color with no head on the pour. No worries. The aroma gets me in a good way, plenty acidic with some good doses of raspberries which still remain 9 years later. A rustic barnyard note sits behind all that. Somehow, the aromas are balanced very well. 
As one could expect, this one attacks your palate in several ways. It's plenty acidic, which is a given, not just from being a Cantillon, but also the raspberries bring a pleasant acidic that's not so sharp as say, Fou Foune. Yet the raspberries also bring some tart, sour, and sweet flavors which soak into the palate and help this beer going down. It's surprisingly drinkable despite the intense activity and fullness found in the liquid. 
Suffice to say, this is a fun and lovely fruit lambic. At a decade old, there's still plenty of life in this bottle, a bottle which I plan to finish on my own tonight. 1,327 charactersDoubleJ, Mar 13, 2013

Pours a lovely raspberry red color, tones of purple and garnet, slightly hazy with a nice, thick, billowy pink head that has decent retention and leaves a touch of spotted lacing behind. The aroma is of fresh, fleshy, pungent raspberry, funk, light chewy oak and touches of vanilla. The flavors are right in line with the nose. Lots of freshly squeezed raspberry, oak, funk, light acidic vinegar, touches of sweet vanilla at the end. The body is great, it's juicy, thick, almost pulpy with a nice zippy level of carbonation that is very lively on the tongue with a great creamy finish.
Verdict: Spectacular fruited lambic from Cantillon and my personal favorite of the Lou Pepe beers. The raspberry is just so fresh and juicy and doesn't really need any support from other flavors to make this a spectacular beer, a great celebration of raspberry. 915 characterskevanb, Mar 04, 2013

A: Super carbonated bottle with some leakage. Cork started slowly pushing out as soon as the cap was removed and could be pulled out with fingers rather than needing a corkscrew. Raised a significant head filling nearly half the glass before quickly receding. Beautiful, clear red liquid with lots of bubble activity.
S: Lots of funk and raspberry. A little jammy with a hint of parmesan cheese
T: Really sharply tart. Lots of fruit, wood, and acetic acid.
M: Highly carbonated, explodes with foam in your mouth. Long linger.
O: This beer could be great, but the over-carbonation in this bottle is really a problem, making it hard to serve and hard to taste until some extended, vigorous swirling gets most of the carbon dioxide out of solution. The smell is lovely and the taste is also very appealing once you can get to it, but the carbonation is just crazy. 896 characterskscaldef, Feb 20, 2013

Pours a red color with a light pink head that fades quickly. The smell isn't very pleasing, kind of like raspberry farts. The taste is much better. I'm getting fruity vinegar notes with a very nice funk. There is an herbal note behind the fruit. The raspberries are good even after a couple of years. 364 charactersoline73, Feb 19, 2013

Glowing ruby red, wispy pink foam, jewel tone but light haze. Cobweb skim, spotty lace.
Funky barrel aroma, wet oak, seedy fresh raspberries.
Blistering sourness, super puckering. Juicy raspberries make your mouth water before going completely bone dry. Nice and oaky, explodes with fruit. A fuller feel, with a slight spritz of carbonation, balanced acidity and a light hit of sharpness. Stable funk with soiled hay and washed rind farmhouse cheese. Just the right amount of nuance and equal parts sour fruit delivery system. 552 charactersemerge077, Feb 15, 2013

2008 vintage poured into Lost Abbey stemware.
A: Dark red with a slight orangish hue and an inch of pinkish beige froth.
S: The aroma displays an absurd amount of jammy, tart, pungent raspberry seed and flesh. It's extremely aromatic and vibrant, with an almost spicy character due to its concentration. There's a lightly sweet crackery malt foundation beneath the fruit. Oak and leather blend with earthy funk. There's a bit of vinegar in there.
T: Sweet and tart raspberry seed and flesh with jammy notes and a subtle malt presence. The fruit is explosive and abnormally expressive. Face meltingly, devastatingly, depressively fruity. Lactic, leathery, and oaky, with a delicious tartness throughout. Vinegar is light in the flavor and there's a pervasive but subtle acetic acidity throughout. Finishes heavy on the fruit with a refreshing tartness and a firm but gentle lactic presence.
M: Upper light to lower medium body with high carbonation. The mouthfeel is sticky, dry, and tannic.
Overall: By far the best bottle of Lou Pepe Framboise I've tried, though I've only had the beer a few times and mostly from older bottles. This was exceptional with a radical funky fruit presence. Highly recommended. 1,223 charactersHopHead84, Feb 10, 2013

T: Light fruity flavors of raspberries and strawberries. There is a pleasent tart and sour apple running through the entire flavor of this beer.

Pours red/pink with a big pink bubbly head. Low retention although there was some lacing around the edges.
Great funky raspberry aroma. Funky and tart with a little fruity sweetness.
Lots of raspberry flavor in this one. Very sweet up front until some of the funk hits mid-palate. Finishes with some tasty raspberry tartness. Straight up sourness isn't as high in this as some other Cantillons, but it's still funky and the raspberry tartness makes up for it.
Well carbonated and creamy mouthfeel. Spot on for Cantillon.
I normally don't like Framboises too much, but was really surprised by this one (probably the first time I've ever had it on a clean palate). Liked it better than the other LP beers and glad I still have a bottle left in the cellar. 792 charactersjmarsh123, Dec 03, 2012

Bright pinkish red body-- very clear and pretty. Lots of streaming bubbles coming up, though the head was decent, the retention is lacking.
The beer is beautiful raspberry notes with a nice diaper funk.
The flavor is very sweet, very very sweet. Loads of raspberries... The funk is pleasant... The sourness is respectable, but it is clear that it will grow in intensity.
feels perfect. nice tartness pulls gently at the sides of my cheeks. well-carbonated.

Beer is a cloudy pink with a smallish white head. Head dissipates quickly, no lace.
Smell contains raspberry, barnyard funk and grass. Good smell and typical Cantillon.
Taste is quite sour. Raspberry, funk, hay. A marked sweetness accompanies the sour. All good, though not as complex as some of the beers from this brewery.
Light bodied, highly carbonated. Sticky and puckering. The sugar makes it a bit hard to get through.

Massive notes of fresh wood, fresh grass, and far-from-fresh fruit. Tart berry bits. Some herbal qualities are subtle... lavender, sage. Extremely unique.
Equally massive in flavor - sweet raspberry, sour white grape, exceedingly tart. So pungent... reminds me of their kriek blended with crack cocaine and pornography. Super juicy, sour at first, becoming dryer and dryer. 
Pretty damn drinkable but I can't help but to sit and think after each taste. Delicious.

T: Range from 4.0 to 5.0. Plenty of basic moldy, chessy funk in all. Tartness more evident in older bottles. Some lemon present in 06. Intense sourness in 02. Surprise was 01 still fruity.
M: Range from 3.5 to 4.5. Semi-moderate body consistent across all bottles. Carbonation varied from foamy to nearly nothing. Tart to very sour and puckering. Cheesy, musty, dusty, earthy dry finish not so varied but older bottles generally tasted "older".

2008 Vintage. Warning: the cork shot out of the bottle as soon as I took the cap off - it was slightly terrifying.
Beer pours a dark purplish ruby red with a fluffy pinkish-white head. The smell is fantastic - raspberries stand out most, but there's a nice mix of funk, sour and oak in there as well. The flavor is still good, but not quite as impressive as the nose. It's a bit simpler than I expected. The raspberry flavor is great, and it's quite sour, but there's not much funk or anything else happening here. It's not too sweet and comes off much drier than its little sister Rose de Gambrinus. Mouthfeel is thin with heavy carbonation, would've liked a little more body here. Overall, this is another fine beer from Cantillon, but I wouldn't rank this up there with the best of their lambics. I enjoyed it more than Rose de Gambrinus, but of the Lou Pepe beers, it's definitely the simplest. A good fruit lambic, but I don't know if I'd seek this out again given what it costs. 1,034 charactersstarrdogg, Aug 06, 2012

A: Poured a hazy reddish color with no head or lacing at all. A few small bits of cork ended up in the beer, but no big deal. The cap was very rusty and the cork...did not look good. 
S: Very nice raspberry and strawberry aromas. There is a bit of oak and some light funk. For a 7 year old Framboise, it smells fantastic and is incredibly inviting. 
T: Surprisingly still rather tart, again a nice combination of raspberry and strawberry flavors with a sizeable amount of oak and barnyard funk coming through, slightly musty. 
M: Extremely easy drinking, while the flavors are bold the mouthfeel is very mellow and smooth. 
O: Extremely impressed at how well this held up. Saying I want more of this is obvious. 815 charactersmdaschaf, Jul 19, 2012

Thanks for opening this with me, mrbubbler!
Slightly hazed rose and dark pink in color with a moderately sized off-white head that lasts longer than expected, eventually leaving dots of stick down the glass.
A big blast of fresh raspberry leaps from the glass, along with big amounts of stinging sourness, along with a mild, funky, earthy character. Superb.
The flavor is exceptional, with a huge combination of fresh raspberry and big sour notes, along with mild leather and some funk. This is so good it seems simple. All the desired flavors are so big, pronounced, and expressive, it doesn't get much better than this.
Medium bodied with high carbonation. A joy to drink.
Simply phenomenal. 713 charactersehammond1, Jul 04, 2012

Pours a gorgeous, deep reddish pink, with a light pink head. Pours about 2 fingers of head, but it reduces almost immediately, leaving pretty much nothing but the most delicious looking raspberry juice you've ever seen. Lack of visible carbonation beyond the occasional bubble is a bit disappointing, though.
Smell is pretty strong on raspberries upfront. Some earthy funk and sourness comes through too. A bit of oak. This is really nice, good meld of smells, but the raspberry definitely takes center stage.
Oh yeah, that's pretty sour. Not as strong on the raspberry as I was hoping or expecting from the smell. There's some raspberry, some oak, some earthy mustiness. The oak is more prominent than in the nose. Very funky. Not quite as nice as the smell, but it's still very tasty. Maybe a bit of citrus and underripe green apple in there too. More like a 4.25, but I'm feeling generous.
Despite the appearance to the contrary, the mouthfeel is actually really nice. Decent carb, not overwhelming, and a slightly thin body, which seems perfect to me. Very slight creaminess, and a smooth finish.
I'm new to Cantillon, and to sours in general, but I've yet to find a loon I didn't enjoy. Another hit. 1,288 charactersrodkin, Jun 25, 2012

Pours a deep purple-red color with some copper hues. Thin pinkish head dissolves into a few wisps of film. 
Explosive sour and fruity tones in the nose, jam packed with raspberries. Plenty of natural fruit tartness with oak and earth. Funky mustiness and lactic sourness with a touch of acidity. 
Building sourness right up front, matched by a ton of raspberries. Earthy oak adds a nice base with plenty of yeasty funk. Musty and yeasty with some hints of red wine and red grapes. Building lactic sourness towards the finish, which is long, dry and lingering. 
Medium body, decent carbonation, extremely dry and lingering on the tongue. This is a great example of how delicious and unique a Cantillon beer can be. I tried a small taste of a 2007 bottle right before this, and the sourness had definitely become amplified from the extra 2 years of age. 901 charactersxnicknj, Jun 20, 2012

A-Looks like raspberry juice, the pink head quickly breaks down.
S-The characteristic Cantillion aroma is here, can pick this smell out from other locations-something about that Brussels air. Lots of fresh picked raspberry aroma still present.
T-The first drink is upfront puckering with then turns into floral raspberries, which then is overtaken again by sourness.
M-A super quick finish, the end note is sour and a bit astringent. Thin bodied.
D-Too sour for me, the wife drank the bulk of this bottle.

Bottle courtesy of alpineclimber. 2008 version.
Pours a slightly hazy dark pink color with a huge beautiful light pink-hued bubbly head that eventually recedes leaving some minimal lacing.
Aromas initially made me say Holy F#$% out loud! Sweet, ripe raspberries coupled with that musty Brett that all the best Cantillons have. Some more lemon, oak and some acidic notes emerge as it warms. Really funky and fruity.
The tastes follow the nose but are sadly a little less enjoyable. I expected a big burst of sourness or Brett funk or fruity berries, and they are all there don't get me wrong, but they are muted compared to my expectations from the aroma. Definitely more oak and vinous flavors than I perceived in the aromas as well. Acidic lemon/white grape skin emerge as it warms a little more.
The mouthfeel is quite light bodied but expected for the ABV. Carbonation is also in the medium range. The finish is dry but not overly so and sour/tart but not overly so there either. To be honest it felt a little watery on my palate which I have never experienced with any of Cantillon's offerings.
Overall this was good, but not great for me at the level of Saint Lamvinous or Fou Foune to be honest. While it is definitely still top class, I don't have the urge/need to seek this out again in the future. Maybe the reputation, expectations and/or the awesome aroma got me too hyped up here 1,599 charactersclaspada, Jun 15, 2012

Thanks to Brandon and Emily for bringing this out from Paris!
Pours a simply gorgeous razzy red. Really lovely cherry blossom caps this one. Nose carries more funk than I'd anticipated, really the earthy aspect of Cantillon's arsenal. The raspberries come through acidic and sharp with hints of vinous shreds. Flavor carries surprising balance. The tartness and buxelles funk are soo well balanced with generous bounties of raspberries. The whole thing comes together and reminds me of a freshly picked raspberry during the high sun of an August day mixed with the grit of a solid days hike. A little full bodied with reserved carbonation accentuated the generous fruit endowment for the beer. Finish made me want another sip of the beer, and a gulp of ice cold water. Really a step up from the Rose, and I appreciate the attention to detail here. 969 charactersharrymel, Jun 12, 2012

Appearance: Pours a hazy ruby brew with Ambar highlights. Forms a fizzy pink head that holds well. Low perceived carbonation.
Aroma: Medium high intensity on the nose. Intense sourness, raspberry and alot of funk: barnyard, leather.
Taste: High intensity on the mouth. Raspberry, citric flavour, some dark fruit manifestation, leather, horse blanket. Just wonderfully bold, intense and complex.
Mouthfeel: Very tart and acidic. Medium body. Relatively low carbonation. Very dry. Love the challenging yet elegant and balanced palate.
Overall: This is just a fantastic classic lambic, a model to others of the style, a world beater in its category. The only reason it didn't get straight 5's throughout is the due to the ponderance given to personal taste.
Additional notes: Paired great with the Indian food, as the acidity cut through the creamy richness of the food and as the fruit and rustic character dealt great with the spicy, floral character of the food. 1,106 charactersendovelico, May 20, 2012

A - Pours a beautiful clear ruby red with one finger of pink foam. Head quickly settles to a thin cap which is maintained. No lacing.
S - Letting the glass sit for a short time, the aroma is a huge rush of raspberries, both tart and jammy. After swirling the glass a few times, more of the funky side emerges, though the aroma is still dominated by fruit.
T - Nice combination of dry, tart raspberry and moderate funk. Raspberry component has absolutely no sweet jam taste, just a nice solid tartness, but not exceptionally sour, which is to be expected for a younger bottle. Funk plays a supporting role here. I think the aroma was a bit better than the taste, but the taste is still very good.
M - Light, crisp mouthfeel with a tart dry finish.
O - Excellent framboise. Would like to try an aged bottle to see where the tartness and funk end up. 884 characterswarnerry, May 01, 2012

3.5 A: Fairly clear plum colored first pour. Three fingers of fizzy pink head that falls quickly and leaves no lacing.
4.5 S: Raspberry is huge in this. Tart, sweet, and powerful. Like any good Cantillon fruit, this is full of acid, but low on funk. Tons of lactic acid with a mild to moderate acetic component. Underneath there is a light musty basement type funk.
4.0 T: Moderately sour with a good tart pucker factor. Raspberry and tangy lactic acid galore. Surprisingly, there's a good bit of funk in there as well. Musty basement, rotting wood, and a mild cheesiness. Sharp, tart raspberry finish. 
3.0 M: The mouthfeel is kinda dull. Lighter medium body. The carbonation is on the lower end for the style, but good enough. The problem is that it isn't very spritzy. Creaminess is lacking as well. This sits rather dead on the tongue.
4.0 D: Tasty framboise. A bit hard to justify the price, but good for a special occasion, like a Pens playoff game. 1,029 charactersDavoleBomb, Apr 19, 2012

S: Funky and sour with an absolutely huge raspberry aroma as well. Smells like crushed raspberries and oak barrel. Lots of funk and lacto sourness. Trademark Cantillon sour in the nose with a ton of raspberries as well. It does not get better than this, not at all. 
T: Again, massive sourness and a ton of raspberries. Lots of funk and barnyard that follows over nicely from the nose. Intensely sour. Oaky and fruity. Fresh, ripe raspberries contribute to the pucker factor. Absolutely delicious.

Pours a light ruby red with plenty of fizz, yielding nice pink head. Pink foam erupts with the aroma of fresh raspberries and sour fruits. Smells funky, barnyard-y, dry.
Tart fruits and strong funkiness dominate the taste. Raspberry sweetness is there early on, yet it fades to finish clean and dry. High acidity, and extremely sour; this brew defines the term puckering. A polarizing flavor profile to say the least, and I love it!
Arguably the most sour Lou Pepe in the lineup, and hands down the best framboise I've had to date. Can't wait to get my hands on another bottle! 669 charactersbrystmar, Feb 29, 2012

Pours a lovely looking ruby, topped with a ½ finger of pinkish colored foamy head. This retains well, leaving back a rich and frothy cascade of lacing which rides high up the sides of the glass. The aroma smells of ripe raspberries, funk, acidity, and a touch of wood. Those juicy raspberries really pop here but the funkiness of this definitely has its place as well. 
The raspberries are right out there in the taste as well but the overall flavor does get a bit intense from the funk and sourness that is present. It definitely weaves in and out of being acidic but then much more along the lines of a fruity tartness as well. This luckily doesn’t get out of hand, as there is just enough of a very light sugary presence here to helps cut things a bit. There is a little more stand out funk here than what I’m used to with this brewery, which stretches into the finish along with some dry edges. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and spritely feeling in the mouth, with a crisp feel that jumps those flavors around in the mouth and helps with keeping things staying interesting. 
This was nice. It had a bit more of a Lambic funkiness to it than I expected but that fresh raspberry flavor and a lively body really kept this energetic feeling in the taste and feel despite the assertiveness of the flavors at times. This is another Cantillon well worth checking out. 1,502 charactersKegatron, Jan 12, 2012

deep fresh raspberries with some fresh oak mixed in. slight funkiness. very ripe and juicy. a bit toned down from the regular rose de gambrinus but still vibrant.
a strong mix of fresh raspberry and fresh oak. very well blended and complex however these two main flavors seem to really balance each other. more sour than i would have expected up front however after a bit it feels toned down. 
very light and easy with a mild mix of carbonation through out. dryness from the oak.

4.58/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I am very appreciative of Stakem for sharing this 2008 bottled in '10 with Kegatron and me. Enjoyed from a Cantillon tulip to match. My 1000th bottle review
 This is exactly what I conjure up in my mind when I think of a raspberry lambic, just outstanding in color and is beautiful sitting in the glass like a gem in its resplendence with a beautiful rosy glow and tight ring after collapsing from 3 fingers, the bead is tiny with light pink lace. The smell is incredible, just so packed with strong fruity and funky odor w/ light floral notes that are still punchy and fresh. The nose is intensely raspberry with kmild hint of sour yeast odor. I love the feel as much as the aroma with huge lactic acidity which seems to enhance the mild sweet tart edges of the fruitiness. There is a pretty dry finish, but semi-sharp with dry/acidic qualities and extremely high carbonation like champagne.
 This blitzes the palate and mouth with both fruity sweet taste and very intense sour lactic infused flavor. The acidity intensifies as the beer is held in the mouth but there is enough sweetness in the flavor to balance from the full fruity raspberry enhancement. The taste comes off almost as bitter/spicy from the carbonic acid the high carbonation level provides. There is a puckering, mouth drying quality w/ slight woodiness and extra tart raspberry juiciness as it finishes with some residual berry, but the funk and bacteria sour flavors linger into the dry end. Simply a wonderful fruit lambic, not many out there that are this complex and able to be savored in the way I found this to be. Intense yet drinkable a true classic, one of the best I have ever had. 1,664 charactersSlatetank, Nov 25, 2011

4.67/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5750ml bottle "2008 sticker" bottled in 2010. I was a little uneasy with this bottle. It appeared that at some point the pressure must have really build up inside and leaked through both the cork and cap and ran down the side of the label. The cap pried off with a hiss and revealed a layering of beer atop the cork which was riddled with rust. The cork was so saturated that it dissolved/broke as I removed it. Fortunately, the bottom half of the cork formed a solid seal and loudly popped as it came out. Shared with some friends and split into matching Cantillon glasses, this brew pours a fairly dark yet clear ruby red. A pink frothy head retains fairly decent. A light swirl revives a finger of pink froth.
The smell of this brew is surprisingly juicy and fresh with earthy ripe raspberries. It is somewhat pitted and grain or seed-like with a sweet over-ripe raspberry smell that is more rich as sweet smelling than what im use to. It has a light grassy element with a touch of funky/stinky cheese. In the background are notes of oak that are lightly musty. As it warms up, it evolves into almost a floral aspect that is quite appealing.
The taste of this brew is quite sour, the expected acidity of the normal Cantillon offering is augmented with a flavor of unripe raspberry which adds a different dimension of acidity. It is earthy and natural in flavor that is deep and unique that really meshes well with the barrel flavoring that comes across lightly musty. Considering how juicy and sweet smelling this brew was, the level of tartness really shocks the sense which was enjoyable.
This is a light bodied brew with a lively level of high carbonation that is not over-done. For being several years old at this point and in the bottle for more than a year, I found this brew smelling/tasting exceptionally bright and refreshing. I really enjoyed the other Lou Pepe's both on tap and in bottles when I had them, but this came across even more appealing to me. I need more of this brew! 1,996 charactersstakem, Nov 14, 2011

Appearance – Appears a ruddy dark pink color as it pouts into a tulip. Half a finger of light red fizzy head dissipates quickly leaving slight lacing.
Smell – Quite pungent – heavy funk and raspberry tartness, acidity, earthiness, and more funk. My mouth waters in anticipation.
Taste – Holy pucker. I’m not sure why this beer, over the other two Cantillons I enjoyed at CBS, had such a high pucker factor. Despite the age, still a wonderful tart raspberry flavor. Heavy funk, slight earthiness, sour acidity, and hints of woodiness.
Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, sprightly carbonation, finishes extremely dry. 
Overall – Unbelievable. One of the best Cantillon’s I’ve had. I really don’t know what made this beer develop as it did but I now want to go buy a ton of this and sit on them for years to hope they become as they did here. I will admit, despite it only being 5% abv, I don’t know if I could finish a bottle of this myself because it was so tart and acidic. But wow, very impressed with this one. 1,076 charactersSpdKilz, Nov 04, 2011

A- Absolutely gorgeous deep red with a hint of purple. Pours with a nice 1 and half finger pink colored head that quickly dissipates to nothing. This is really unique and interesting looking beer.
S- HUGE bouquet of tart raspberries up front. Strong smell of oak and plenty of funk and acid help add to complexity of the aroma.This thing smells freaking heavenly. 
T- A little less raspberries here than I expected, though I'm not complaining. This one is pretty tart up front followed by plenty of raspberry aroma that almost tricks you into thinking its sweet, though its not at all. Lots of oak and complex flavors from the spontaneous fermentation. 
M- Lots of lively carbonation. 
O- Awesome beer. My first framboise and what a great one! I'll be locating some more asap. 848 characterskungpao, Oct 31, 2011

The smell is a pungent, musty, dusty raspberry. The smell is either really good cheese or really bad meat. Tanic and basement like. The taste is very funky and intense. Acidic, lemon, funk, and fruit. Really glad I got to taste this. The sourness sticks around for a while after your finish your drink. 396 characterskbutler1, Oct 24, 2011

A - pours a reddish orange color (more red than orange) without much of a head on it
S - smells beautiful - lots of raspberries with some citric tones with a layer of funk enveloping everything
T - huge citric tones up front that locks up the mouth. There is also a slight raspberry flavor present in the front as well. The more this one rolls back on the tongue the more the raspberries pop. The more this warmed, the stronger the raspberries were. On the backend I got surprise, surprise, more raspberries mixed with an acidic sourness. There is a slight bit of funk in the back too.
M - medium body, a little watery, with a carbonation burn at the back that leaves a dry finish
D - really solid framboise. Even with age on it the raspberries popped like crazy. I really enjoyed the added level of citric tones and subtle hints of funk thrown behind the raspberries. This makes we want to try the other Lou Pepes that much more. 948 charactersbirchstick, Oct 19, 2011

A - Pours a nice cloudy Pink colour with a nice large Pink head that retains well then laces from a film.
S - Pungent rasberry aromas with a nice vineous aroma and sour. Incredible.
T - Up front some nice delicat Rasberry flavours, with the vineous sourness kicking in afterwards and before it gets too much to handle the rasberyy vapours balnce out and linger to leave you wanting more.
M - Tart, and light body with medium carbonation. Exquisite.

2007 Vintage, Bottled September 2009
When I first breached the cork there was loads of vinegar to be smelt.
Red colour. Not much head but there's ample carbonation.
Smell is field and wild and cooked mushrooms. Very pleasant funk to this one, nothing potentially disagreeable in here. Does remind me a bit of Lindemans sweetened Lambics in the nose profile though. There's lemon and herbs and really savoury vegetables. Ripe/overripe/fermenting fruit. Honeycomb, malt and carob. Cherries and roses. Smell does get a bit more faecal and organic as I get down the bottle.
Taste is more mushrooms and sweet potato. A pleasant sourness with the tiniest sweet touch. Not cloying at all in either direction. Something about this beer makes me think of regional French cooking, in a really good way. It's like there's garlic in the nose and taste. This beer is deeply interesting.
Mouthfeel is nice. Bubbly and tickly.
I was a bit put off initially by the nose profile but lying behind it is a delicious, drinkable and complex beer. I would love to get more of this. 1,130 charactersdanieelol, Oct 09, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +11.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52008 Vintage courtesy of KickInTheChalice.
Pours a deep, dark, beautiful red. Darker than the Kriek. There's a hint of white foam that fades into a ring over time. Perfection. I'll be using that term a lot when discussing this beer.
Smells incredible, like fresh raspberries. There's a tiny hint of lemon tartness, and a touch of funk, but the raspberries dominate the nose. Unbelievable.
Taste is equally perfect. Fresh squeezed raspberries assault the palate. It's tart, but not overwhelmingly so. Funk is negligable.
Feel is delightful, light crisp, well carbonated.
Overall - an outstanding beer. Top notch. 616 charactersreadbaron, Oct 07, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52006 Vintage. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tasting glass.
Appearance: The cloudy color is instantly recognizable as the only color raspberries can be. A nice soft white froth gently recedes to a ring around the edge along with a few wisps of lace.
Smell: The raspberry in the aroma is quite sour. There are some light malt notes, and some good funk in there, but at this point it is mostly sour.
Taste: The raspberry flavor in this beer is just brilliant. With five or so years in the bottle, the flavor has become balanced between tart and funky. 
Mouthfeel: I suspect that over time the body has dried out and lightened up a bit as the beer continued to develop. At this stage the body is on the light side of medium, with medium strength fizzy carbonation. Somewhat acidic, but not overly so. 
Overall: I am a sucker for good raspberry sours, and this is probably my favorite one at this point. Simply fantastic, I would like to always have this in my fridge, and my future beer purchases will probably reflect that desire. 1,037 charactersKickInTheChalice, Sep 26, 2011

 Pours burnt orange-pink with a dirty collar for head. Aroma is massive funk, sulfur, leather and maybe some fruit lurking somewhere. Smells abrasive!
 Tart, dry, pungent. Did I already say dry? I don't think I have ever had a monster comparable to this beer in its dryness and sour character except the Beatification that I don't remember having at Darkness Day 2010 :/
Excellent mouthfeel with loads of crisp carbonation.

2002 label, 2004 cork.
A- Pours a nice looking reddish brown color, cloudy body, yellow hues come out, ½ fingers worth of a light pink head.
S- Very pungent smelling beer, huge funky musty raspberry presence, tart, vinegar really nice, makes my mouth water.
T- WOW….huge tart flavor, the sour presence is so big, really acidic, very puckering, some oak is present, raspberries are there but not upfront, ageing has done wonders to this beer.
M- Light body, moderate to low carbonation, really puckering, dry finish.
O- This beer was pretty impressive, incredibly puckering and tart, really enjoyed my 5 oz pour, would love to try a fresh bottle of this to compare.
Recently had the 2008 Version and i enjoyed the freshness of the beer more so than the aged version. Love the fresh raspberries that come out, really easy drinking, nice tartness and funk. 901 charactersChriscrundwell12, Sep 01, 2011

2001 Vintage
Big thanks to Adam for this one @Woodshop Classix
App- A very light brown with a lot of streaking gold. Not a head, just whispy bubbles in the glass, same thing with a quick swirl.
Smell- Damp and dank apple, small yeast notes and a hefty bit of funk with some tart notes as well.
Taste- The taste follows the nose and this was super acidic with an unmatched, apple like funk. A very superb well done beer. Has aged amazingly well with a nice dry oak and musty notes.
Mouth- Suprisingly light bodied with a medium carbonation level. Spritzy yeast and barnyard notes abound on this one.
Drink- 1 word. Amazing. 681 charactersFosterJM, Aug 29, 2011

Pours a light layer of pink hued white head. Color is a grapefruit ruby red.
Aroma: Huge raspberry! Crazy for being that old. Dusty, musty raspberries. Very funky and fruity. Cobwebs and wet basement. Oak barrels show as well.
Taste: This is one the sourest beers I have ever had... more sour than Riserva '10. Just intense. Mouth puckering. Oak flavors shows. It also has an old, musty flavor. Cobweb and basement. Vinegar. The raspberries don't show as much, but I still taste the fruit. Big acidic kick! So intense.
Mouthfeel: Sour, tart, intense. Lighter bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. Ends pretty clean.
Overall, this was a great beer. It was amazingly sour and tart. So mouth-watering. A very well done beer. Cantilllon has done it again!
Edit: have had some fresher bottles (and older vintages) and the raspberries are always there on this beer. It isn't as sour as I remember it being. It is incredibly juicy and fruity. Such a treat. 1,018 charactersmothman, Aug 27, 2011

A - Pours a pinkish red color, pink fizzy head, thin collar, thin cap.
S - Sharp sour/tartness, raspberries are still there for the most part, lots of barn, very funky, lots of acidity. My nose turns inside out with each sniff.
T - Raspberry purée, lots of sharp sour/tart funkiness, slight oak. Surprised how well the fruit notes have held up after all these years. An utter onslaught of raspberries, sour, and funk.
M - Light, fizzy carbonation, super dry finish.
O - I thought both 2001 and 2002 were pretty close, taste wise. I didn't prefer one over the other, both were excellent. I'll have to open a more recent vintage and compare. A must-try. 822 charactersSean9689, Aug 27, 2011

Smell: Lots of barnyard funk, hint of raspberry. Crazy earthy, mineral smells along with some wood. Powerful smell. Achieves a great balance that elevates the flavor.
Taste: Extremely, lemony sour. Giant funk like the nose with some oak and raspberry in the finish. Hard to describe, but endlessly complex; minerals, fruits, musty wild yeast notes melding with oak notes, with wave after wave of heavy sourness.

A: Pours a dirty brownish-red with a cloudy thin head that fizzed away quit quickly. 
S: The nose is full of tart unripe raspberries mixed with sweet raspberry preserves all blended with a crazy funky blast of sweaty socks. 
T: Tastes like raspberry Warheads candy (malic and ascorbic acids mostly). I get almost no vinegar burn. The raspberry is almost overpowered by the sour, but it’s still sweet and flavorful, and the sweaty funk is there is full force.
M: Ultra dry and chalky with very low carbonation and a medium body.

4.5/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 vintage purchased in Brussels from Bier Tempel.
Had to uncork with a bottle opener, but not due to a lack of pressure—the huge thunk as it opened almost perforated my eardrums.
Looks red, bright and very pleasant. Head foams up at the beginning, but then fizzed itself out so that only a thin ring of fine bubbling remains. Carbonation is gorgeously fine. Looks a great fruit lambic.
Nose is wonderfully and genuinely raspberry fresh. Plenty of tart fruit, a hint of sweetness and lots of genuine lambic acidity to give its basis. The fragrance of the fruit is very true and really lovely.
Taste has that classic Cantillon acidity: raw, cutting and tart, but the sweetness and fragrance of the raspberries gives a truly wonderful counterbalance. Still acidic and with a slightly strained bitterness on the finish, but everything else restrains and leavens it beautifully. Yes. This is a wonderful balance for a fruit lambic. Restrained, truly fragrantly fruity, balanced, but still raw and aggressive.
Yes, lovely. The fruit is just right in this one, and the Cantillon acidity is slightly more restrained. Gorgeous. 1,128 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 21, 2011
3.81/5  rDev -14.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Shared with Klym 750ml vintage 2008
Poured into Lost Abbey Tulip.
A: Fluffy rose pedal bubbles rise like cupcakes over the red valentine body of love. Very pretty looking beer, with a dainty femininity to it. Pinks and reds, like a sappy love letter. I think I'm in love. Really though, this is truly a great looking beer, I didn't know bubbles could be so pink. I could see some high class drinking sessions where everybody is looking dapper in suits while sipping on this cotton candy headed brew. 
S: Some earthy dirt covered raspberries with some dusty leathers. The leathers smell sweet, like a dessert wine was spilled all over them. I take that back, the leather is literally soaked in muscat grape wines. A little bit of tart raspberry/cherry creeps up the nostrils. Really very subtlely woody and rosey throughout, a soft berry sniffer. The earthiness and berry-ness are intertwined. 
T: Dusty rustic raspberries with tart juices instead of sweet ones. Not overly bitter in the tartness, but very puckeringly dry. Some oak dust rests on these tart berries like garnish of contrast. The dryness rushes in to leave you with a very raspberry like texture in the mouth. You really get the sensation like you are eating the manliest earthy raspberries, no real sweetness, just tartness and dirt. Not so much leather in the taste, as I think the sourness takes a flamethrower to any remaining subtle flavors. 
M: This has almost no sensation of bubbles, but the body is solidly of a medium grade. There's a texture to the mouth that isn't so unlike the little hairy seeds on fresh organic raspberries. Soft and dry, but a very fine sensation of textured raspberries/blackberries/othersimilarlookingberries remains my final say. It's dry, but no cottonmouth.
O: Cantillon gives me an interesting framboise, but not one that's really that good. Earthiness instead of sweetness? Sounds fine to me; leather in the nose? Awesome....but this is a framboise where raspberries should reign supreme. The raspberries may have reigned over this bottle at some point, but honestly the sensations of tartness and eventually sourness overwhelmed a subtle berry note. The beer looks and feels of quality; it even smelled of a promising interpretation. However, the taste ultimately is dominated by sensations rather than flavors. Perhaps my bottle wasn't the best, but it was by no means compromised beyond reason. If I was to just see someone drinking this beer I'd have been infinitely jealous; having tasted it: not so much. The visual and smells keep this in the realm of respectability. 2,585 charactersCavery, Jul 18, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42008 vintage poured into a snifter. 
A: Pours a mostly opaque maroon with a frothy head that is so pink it looks like a party trick. If there was ever a beer that should mascot this style it's this one. 
S: This one definitely had some putrid notes when I had it a little too cold, but as it warmed up to normal temperatures it started smelling quite nice. Very tart raspberries and even some cherry notes with some oak and barnyard funk. Tartness definitely stands out. 
T: Sure enough the bite on this is quite tart and can hit some parts of the mouth with an acidic sting. Sweeter raspberries pop out with an almost musty air in the middle taste that dies out with a linger of lemon zest and grassy notes. More tart than I expected and probably more than I really enjoy, but I can't say the beer isn't unusually good. 
M: Like every cantillon I've had it's carbonated to a level that makes the flavors seem like they're celebrating and comes into the mouth like a dam broke on your lips. Refreshing, crisp, true to the style. 
O: Though my fears allayed as the beer warmed up, I did pick up this bottle at a beer shop in london that didn't seem to know anything about cantillon, much less beer in genral, and I can't account for the care that they or anyone else handled this and whether or not the bottle may have been compromised in some way. I will say simply that tart raspberry with a handful of other punching notes is about all I experienced with this beer and it wasn't as complex, sweet, or flavorful as I expected. If it's what the beer is intended to be, then great, it was good. If not and my bottle was compromised, then the beer must be damned amazing because that's the best compromise I've had. 1,718 charactersKlym, Jul 18, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - 2005 vintage. Pours a hazy lipstick red with a small off-white head. This dissipates to a thing ring fairly rapidly, but can be easily refreshed. No sign of any carbonation bubbles.
S - Big hit of raspberry, with a layer of funk sitting behind it. Lemon zest, horse blanket, sweet tobacco.
T - Begins with a mellow tartness before the flavour of the raspberry moves forward in the middle. Citric tartness really starts to kick in at the end and leaves the mouth watering into a long sour, tobacco flavours finish. Very fresh for a 6 year old beer, but well integrated.
M - Tingle of soft-medium fine carbonation and light-medium body. As expected and very good.
D - Yet another winner from Cantillon. Complex, refreshing and hugely well crafted. 753 charactershaz77, Jul 17, 2011

This is a BEAUTIFUL beer, pure raspberry pink with an equally pink head. What a crazy looking head! Gorgeous beer.
Smells wonderful, tons of raspberry and tons of acidic sour.
Tastes even better, there is a CRAZY amount of raspberry flavor in this beer. This is the fruitiest lambic I've ever tasted. Also an extremely sour beer, this is heartburn in a bottle right here. The extreme fruitiness and extreme sourness combine into a remarkable lambic.
Very nice carbonation, good body to support the fruit and sour kick in the flavor.
Generally I prefer kriek to framboise but this one blew me away, much better than the Lou Pepe Kriek, just as good or better than the Blabaer we had the same night. I love this beer and want more!

A: cloudy, murky pink/red dirty amber. nice off-white head.
S: i was surprised at how the raspberries jumped out despite the age on this. funkiness, earthiness, and barnyardy aromas mixed in.
T: remember those super sour candies some kid would dare you to eat as a kid? drop a raspberry flavored one in a shot of distilled vinegar and it might approach this, only i don't imagine that would be nearly as sour as this lambic. i didn't get much of the raspberry in the taste. very dry and the puckering sourness overwhelms. maybe a touch of residual sugar woulda helped this for me. 
M: the intense sourness dried my mouth out and made me crave water. i felt like my teeth and tongue were power-washed with battery acid. the sourness lingered for an hour, even after trying to cleanse my mouth with a gumballhead, cigs, BCBS variants, and water. i did get a nice frothiness and liked the fine carbonation in this, however.
O: i want to be cool and like stuff like this, and will keep trying. if you're a fan of sours, i'm quite sure you think i'm an idiot and hate me right now. maybe this review will get reported and deleted like my thomas hardy's review. it's just my honest opinion, and i'm no expert. but i review as much for myself as for style, if not moreso.

Pours a beautiful, glowing deep ruby red. Two fingers of light pink head forms and quickly recedes, leaving me with a glass of Hawaiian Punch...
Wow, the most intense blast of pure fresh raspberries fills my nose right away. This is the most fruit forward Cantillon I have ever smelled. Literally like sticking your nose straight into a crate of fresh, ripe raspberries. Awesome. The typical Cantillon funk has been pushed to the background, very subtle mustiness and faint oak character, this one is all about the fruit...
Tart and intensely fruity. Lemon acidity followed by extremely tart raspberries. The funk that was mostly absent in the nose comes through stronger in the taste. Musty and dry. Finishes extremely dry with a nice touch of oak. Delicious.
Light to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Tart and slightly acidic, finishes extremely dry...

Pour: Ruby red, slightly oily looking body with a bright pink 2 fingered, prickly carbonated head. 
Nose: Very tart raspberries (not quite fully ripened), musty oak, slight barnyard funk, vinegar, red wine and lemon juice to round it out.
Taste: BAM! You've just been punched with a raspberry fist...right down your throat! Seriously tart raspberries, slight lemon juice at first, followed by slight oak and barnyard flavors that can't defeat the initial raspberry tartness. Finish is slight sweetness from the fruit along with hints of red wine and vinegar.
Mouthfeel: Perfect for this style. Light and crisp, slight prickly carbonation just below being oily. Perfect body in my opinion.
Overall: Fantastic. This is my idea of a perfect sour at the top of my list. Hope to find a bottle. 816 characterswaltersrj, May 27, 2011

A- a steady pour yields three fingers of fluffy pink head that settles quickly leaving only a few wisps on top. Beautiful slightly hazy deep pink in color that's glows spectacularly when held to light. 
S- ripe juicy tart raspberries and musty funky wet wood. Sharp acidity and touches of red wine vinegar. Some barnyard aspects going on but this one is all about the fruits. 
T- wow! Now that's a butthole ripper right there. Bracingly sour right upfront with super tart under ripe raspberries and lemon juice. Musty funky yeast and rotten oak. Touches of sweetness attempting to fights its way through the sour but barely making a dent. As the brew does some serious warming the rougher edges smooth out and the whole thing comes together to a level of perfection that no framboise I've had can touch. 
M- a few steps less then medium in body and a good bit of sharp bright carb. A pucker that will rip the drawls from yo ass a pull them out ya mouth. My juices are flowing for minutes after each sip. 
O- to say this brew is one dimensional is all wrong. Its powerful and confrontational in flavor but very pure and to the point. Massively sour and fruity with all funk playing second fiddle but in a good way. Each and every time I have this beer I'm blown away by it. 1,318 charactersoglmcdgl, May 24, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5For the most part, I've been disappointed with aged framboises. This is the 2007 vintage, bottled 14 Sept 2009, consumed 29 April 2011 in celebration of our last night living in DC (for now, at least) and having those French bastards rip us off $10K for a POS UHV tee they made for us.
Decanted, this is clear with a dense, light pink head with excellent retention and lacing, this is a great looking lambic. The nose has a beautiful, bright, raspberry character, fruity and jammy with macerated fruit. The lambic base is expressed as a more lemony, ripe character, in line with Cantillon's Lou Pepe line. A little grass and hay are present as well.
The palate opens with quite an intense sourness, very lemony, very lemon-rind like with a distinct raspberry fruitiness, moderately jammy but also very bright, ripe and almost floral. Demonstrating the dichotomy that is a fruit lambic - ripe, delicate, fruit character coupled with an intensely sour base. There's a definite musty character, one that's lightened up by the lemony sourness. Drying, sour and lemony acidity are present on the finish, along with a rather prominent fruit character. Despite being relatively young, this does has a touch of solventy, rotting raspberry character present. Seedy tannins are present, lending a mild nuttiness to the flavor, especially the finish. Despite the high acidity, I seem to have no problem plowing through the first half of the bottle and savoring the second.
Ultimately, this is the completely unlike Hommage in that it leans more heavily on the sourness rather than the fruit. Additionally, this just doesn't seem to age as well as the Drie Fonteinen framboises seem to (I only have Hommage as a reference, but I hear Framboos is rather amazing even 12 years on).

4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5
2003 vintage picked up at Sam's in Clybourn today. At $30 a bottle, I wasn't going to pay up another $15 to carry it back home. Into a wine glass
A: Hazy pink with a thin white head that recedes fairly quickly. This would be clear (it was when I picked it up) but it doesn't take well to a train ride in a backpack
S: Opens up with a ton of funk - wet leather, horse blanket - before a mild raspberry note comes through. Fruit character is well expressed, with the aroma carrying through very well. Age might have something to do with the shift in balance towards a more funk-forward beer. Acidity is noticeable
T: Opens up sour and tart with plenty of acidity. Funk is restrained compared to the sourness - very forward and bracing. Acidity is prominent, lemony in nature. Fruit comes through in the middle, with a delicate raspberry flavor that works very well, now that my palate has been opened up by the sourness. Finishes dry, tart and long
M: Soft carbonation, light body and a delicious finish. Great stuff
D: A 750 is going to be no problem. OTOH, I think I'm going to drink my fruit lambics fresh and age my gueuzes.
**Edit 26 March 2011**
Joe was kind enough to share a bottle of the 2002 vintage (bottled in 2004). Light, this is a clear amber and is lightly carbonated. The nose has rotting, overripe raspberries and nail polish remover. Not much funk, there's some pie-like cooked fruit character, mildly jammy. The palate opens super sour, definitely too much so. Not really acetic or lactic, is this what an excess of malic acid tastes like, but it is unpleasant. Light in carbonation, this is too sour in my book. 3.5/3/2.5/3/2.5 3,481 charactersDefenCorps, Apr 30, 2011

A - Dark strawberry color, a little hazy with a 1-finger, pink chanpagne-like head that fades away fairly quickly.
S - Very rich raspberry, brett sour yeast, oak, light malt. Amazing, heady aroma.
T - Sour raspberry, lemon-cirtrus, milder oak than implied by the smell, a tad bit of malt sweetness that winks at thinking about trying to balance the tart sourness. This is a remarkable beer with wild yeast flavors that blow into the kettle through the open windows in the attic of the brewery. It tastes medieval if that's possible. 
M - Light-medium body and medium carbonation. Effervescent, puckering and drying.
O - Top notch. I've been learning to appreciate sour beers like Consecration. This is even more sour but it is so good, there's no break-in period. I'm giving it an A, my wife would give it an A+ because it is right in her wheelhouse. 908 charactersTucquan, Apr 09, 2011
2.78/5  rDev -37.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3Thanks to bucketboy (Joe) for surprising us with a Lou Pepe diagonal on the day of the tasting. 11th beer consumed overall, and the first of the Lou Pepe variants. Bottle from 2002.
The pour yields an uninspiring dirty brown amber with orange hues. Not much carbonation is evident, as this one is just a bit more carbonated that tap water. 
The aroma is funky and sour with overripe and rotting, festering raspberries come to the front followed immediately by some acetone. Extremely sour on the palate, but nothing lactic or acetic. The pedio has taken over this beer, yielding a warhead like sourness, but taken up 3 notches. I am guessing malic acid, but that is just a shot in the dark. A more fruity raspberry flavor comes through later, but this is again a sour candy-like fruitiness and not the authentic and refreshing bright and fresh fruit as you find in Cantillon's young fruit lambics.
I don't know what it is about raspberries that make them seemingly poor fruits for aging with bugs for a long time, but this was the second year in a row that the raspberry sour (V006 last year) or lambic was the disappointment of the tasting. I would like to review this fresh, as I imagine that how it is meant to be consumed. 1,229 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Apr 09, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42008 sticker date (2010 bottling). No bottled on date. Opened on March 7, 2011.
A brilliant ruby red with a one finger raspberry-stains pink head that dissipates to a ring about the glass, saying, "Here. This is what you came to drink. I found it."
Juicy raspberries, citrus, a nice acetic acidity. Faint brett. Raspberries and raspberry vinegar.
I can never understand how they get so much colorful and piquant raspberry character in this. This is young, and the slightly viscid body makes me feel as if I'm drinking the blood of some yet undiscovered race of raspberry creatures. Instead of iron, their hemoglobin carries subtle traces of funk and oak. 
Slightly undercarbonated at this point in its young life. A nice balance of acidity and tartness.
I've enjoyed LP Framboise up until the three year mark, but I always enjoy a fresh bottle of LP for the vibrant fruit character. Unbelievably juicy. 907 charactersVerecund, Mar 08, 2011

Sour, tart and sweet raspberry characteristics in the aroma, some acidity and funk in the background.
Acidic and tart raspberry in the flavour which sweetens up a bit in the middle, with a sour funk on the finish. Some bready malt rises up well into the aftertaste, almost but not quite replacing the acidity.
Medium-bodied, slick and sticky texture, with a moderate amount of carbonation.
Enjoyed this one much more than the Kriek, perhaps the raspberries marry better with the style and blending a bit more based on their inherent nature. Definitely one to pick up if it's available, the fruit does this one justice. 774 charactersIronDjinn, Mar 03, 2011

This beer pours a rather glassy, yet radiant dark red cherry amber hue, with two fingers of loosely foamy, and generally bubbly diluted pink head, which leaves a broadly spaced spread of thin soap scum lace around the glass as it quickly and evenly settles.
It smells quite pungent - the aroma jumps out at you at first with sour, fruity acetic acid - could be lemon, could be raspberry, though the vinegar base is hard to dismiss, with a strong sense of mildly funky barnyard yeast, a mixed berry jam sweetness duly following up, and a further earthy mustiness bookending the extremes. The taste is strong, tart, sour fruit - lemon and underripe raspberry again the obvious suspects, making one's head almost involuntarily shake, before suggestions of musty basement, tannic oak barrel, a soft, actually somewhat sweet pale graininess, and earthy, subtly funky yeast arrive a little less than promptly on the scene, to no ill effect.
The carbonation is indeed there, but sedate in its moderately frothy ramblings, the body on the light side of medium weight, and astringent as an ex-girlfriend's personality assassination in terms of its smoothness assessment. It finishes with a tart 'n fruity 'n funky re-assertion, bringing the nose 'round full circle. How very zen.
A lambic with an inherent tartness that is so full, and yet blended, that I can't really apologize for the difficulty in readily discerning other flavours, i.e. the fruit, which is generally more inferred, than directly tasted. If I wasn't such a fan of sour, spicy, and/or tart characteristics, I don't think I could see how this offering might score so high. However, I am, and it surely does. 1,773 charactersbiboergosum, Feb 18, 2011
4/5  rDev -9.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42007 bottle. Clear bright red, medium head. Nose is tightly woven brett, fresh raspberries. Very juicy as with most Cantillon fruit lambics. Mouth is very tight, refined, juicy raspberries, acidity, and barnyard brett. Acidity is mostly on the front end and not on the finish. The high acidity makes this much less attractive than the Lou Pepe Kriek from the same year. I'm thinking it's just really difficult to make a raspberry lambic or raspberry sour without it being acidic over a couple years. 499 charactersJAXSON, Dec 05, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Another fine brew from Cantillon. Vintage 2006 bottle poured into my Cantillon wine glass.
Deep, clear red raspberry color. A slight cap of light pink, tiny bubbles at the top. Pretty much what I expected.
Aroma is filled with raspberries, raspberries, raspberries everywhere. Also backed up with musty basement and slight funk aromas. This one is going to be sooour.
Sweet raspberry opening, but quickly plunges into sour, sour, sour raspberry and raspberry seeds. This beer is exceedingly seedy. Very interesting. Acidic. One of the sourest beers I've ever had. Not particularly complex, but I didn't necessarily expect it to be, and I love what the beer is presenting.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Light-medium bodied, super-dry finish, good carbonation.
Drinkability suffers only because it's so completely, intensely sour. I still polished off half a bottle without a problem, but this will wreck your palate. 
Great beer. Recommended for any fan of lambic. 961 charactersdavod23, Sep 26, 2010

The beer pours a reddish-purple color with a pink head. A great looking beer. The aroma is great. I get a lot of raspberries, but hidden in the background is the Cantillon funk that I love so much. The flavor is even better than the aroma. I get tart raspberries, oak and some of the Cantillon funk. The beer is so dry that it makes your mouth water as soon as you drink it. The salivary glands are working in overdrive. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 
Not only one of the best sours I have ever tried, this is one of the best beers I have had period. It more than lived up to the hype. Well worth the $29 I paid for the bottle and I would buy another bottle again in a heartbeat. 791 charactersMora2000, Sep 14, 2010

Served in wine goblet (similar to the one with the cantillon logo) with moderate carbonation. Almost all of the bubbles disappear.
Smells entirely of raspberry. Almost all remnants of grain is overpowered by fruit. The taste is like eating a bunch of small, brightly colored raspberries; not the dark red sweet ones.
The mouthfeel is is solid and the carbination gives a spritzer like feeling.
This is very drinkable for the style. The tartness of the beer goes perfect with the fruit flavor. Highly recommended. 642 charactersandrewinski1, Sep 04, 2010

T- Better with warmth again. VERY sour. Acetic start with a great super tart raspberry finish.

Pours red with pretty much no head whatsoever. It's aged so understandable. Nice color though.
Raspberry very strong in the smell, reminds me of Raspberry Tart but with a buttload of sour funk.
Raspberries also pretty strong in the taste but also covered with an insane amount of sourness. Extremely vinegary, barnyard notes, very sour lemon, did I mention sour? Totally numbing to the tongue. It only gets more sour and funky as it goes on.
Although very enjoyable, this has to be the most sour beer I've had, as I've heard of the Lou Pepe series. 636 charactersChico1985, Aug 22, 2010

Pours a murky red/plum/pink color with a finger of light pink head that camps out for a while.
When agitated, a fresh raspberry aroma invades the nose and gives an absolutely amazing feeling that is hard to describe...if I close my eyes it is like I'm running through a garden complete with fresh fruit, dirt, grass, morning dew. Just incredible.
The flavor can't live up to the aroma but I'll be damned if it isn't spectacular anyway. Lots of dirt and stanky cheese underneath a blanket of raspberry, strawberry, and grape fruitiness. There is a sour bite that is magnified exponentially if you swish the beer around your mouth a bit before swallowing. I almost accidentally spit beer all over my keyboard because it hit a sweet spot on my tongue and made me pucker like crazy. 
The finish is very long and full of raspberry. The body is medium and carbonation seems lower on the tongue than my eyes woud lead me to believe. Very juicy up front but a dry finish.
Overall this is an absolutely stunning, world class beer. Supremely balanced with a nice level of sourness that satisfies my craving without giving me rot gut. Huge fruitiness despite sitting 2 years in the bottle. Like with most Cantillons, a 750ML bottle needs to be split at least 2 ways so I really wish this one was available in 375's. Oh well. A beer this special needs a friend to share it with anyway. 1,490 charactersalcstradamus, Aug 22, 2010

Brewer: Brasserie Cantillon
Style: Lambic - Fruit
Glass: Oversized wine glass 
Presentation:
Cantillon's stately bottles of beer could easily be confused for wine. The label art is very nice. 
Appearance: 
Gurgling reddish-pink with a towering head of pink fizz. Carbonation blasts up the sides of the glass.
Aroma: 
Tart and sour -- mostly raspberry and sour fruit. As it warms, the oak seeps through nicely.
Taste: 
Like getting slapped silly with a sour stick whilst rolling in a tub of the tartest raspberries ever to ferment in an oak barrel. My God! My mouth puckered like no other into a horrible grimace, dragging the other features along with it into a crumpled ball of agony and anguish.
Mouthfeel: 
It's hard to judge such a quaint thing when your face has puckered in on itself. Smooth and light-bodied probably. There may have been crisp and ample carbonation.
Harmony: 
Cacophony's more like it.
Would I get it again?:
I would cellar it for an additional four years, which would hopefully tame its wild side. I would get it again to run this foolhardy experiment.

2007 vintage. Served side by side with Cantillon Rosé de Gambrinus.
This beer has a gorgeous appearance - a reddish-purple hue, with a pink foam head that sticks around longer than expected, and leaves no lacing, as is expected. 
Wonderful aromas of raspberries, hay, barnyard funk. Classic Cantillon scents - simply wonderful. I could sniff this beer for several minutes without taking a drink. The aroma alone is worthy of praise and attention.
This beer is truly excellent. While definitely tart, I would not say that it is incredibly sour. Lou Pepe Framboise is extremely drinkable, and has a much milder acetic finish than the Rosé de Gambrinus. Very pleasant lingering tart raspberry aftertaste. A terrific offering from a fabulous brewery. 832 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 02, 2010

A: Medium red body. Slight pinkish hues. Thin, fizzy pink head quickly crashes into a broken collar around the edges. No lacing.
S: Bright raspberries. Nice sweetness with an underlying tartness and sourness that complements it well. Slightly earthy with decent funk.
T: Like the nose, this is all about the raspberries. Not overwhelmingly sweet, but nice and juicy. The sourness and tartness is present but is not puckering... my guests that had never had a true framboise were not bowled over with so much sourness that they couldn't enjoy it! Its got that underlying funk that most cantillon lambics have.
M: Effervescent with assertive carbonation. Medium bodied. Well balanced between sweet and sour/tart. 
D: Top notch. The Lou Pepe fruit lambics never fail me. 846 characterscallmemickey, Jul 07, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.52006 vintage (i.e. bottled in 2008). Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Drie Fonteinen tumbler. 
Venetian red liquid with a large, active, faintly pink head that fizzes down to a lasting collar and slick. Very light lacing. 
The presence of raspberries in the nose is fleeting. The aroma is otherwise vaguely soapy, woodsy, with a hint of seaweed and pickled plum. 
Tart on the palate, suggesting fresh sour cherry, lemon juice, and a hint of vinegar (though I wouldn't say this is vinuous). The oak contributes a tannic bitterness which adds a nice complexity to the lambic base. Instead of the expected barnyard funk developing, there is a secondary acidity that is surprisingly intense and lasting. The finish is bright yet almost musty or even salty - definitely has "umami." 
Mouthfeel is a touch astringent and maybe a little oily. 
There is an underlying sweetness from the fruit that never quite comes to the front of the flavor profile but keeps eluding you as you slowly sip away the bottle. 
An excellent aged framboise, but there is room for improvement. Perhaps it needs more time to cellar (or maybe it is better when very fresh)? 1,150 charactersaugustgarage, Jul 01, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42007 vintage...very awesome. Beer is PINK and hazy and forms a nice pink head with moderate to high carbonation. The head falls away leaving no lacing on the glass (its not expected to). Looks great.
Aroma is sour and tart with some acetic notes and strong raspberry character. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had. Classic Cantillon smell.
Beer is very tart and not as acetic as I thought it was going to be, this is probably a good thing but the acetic character would likely grow over time slightly. There is nice raspberry flavors and good fruit tartness at the back. Some lactic notes and a slightly tannic quality overall as well. Nice carbonation in the mouth and highly drinkable. This could be one of my favorite Cantillons so far. 750 charactersdrabmuh, Jun 30, 2010

4.82/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750mL corked & capped bottle poured into a stemmed glass. 2006 vintage, bottledon Sept. 1st, 2008. 
(A)- Pours a deep blood red color that produced a good white to pink head that dissipated down to bubbles. 
(S)- A sour yet super ripe tart cherry & raspberry fruits. A dense smell of a bread-like oakiness behind all the fruits that are almost creamy from the oak. A beautiful aroma. 
(T)- Wow, a super duper sour punch up front with a kiss of tart cherry & raspberry fruits. Has a sour midpalate that turns dry and wood-like with more fruits. Finishes with the same super sour fruit flavor, but it all meshes together well. Some serious hay & horseblanket funk at the end too. 
(M)- A huge fizzy carbonation level that creates a huge party in the mouth. Lightly sweet with a potent tart/sour kick that makes you smack your lips after each sip. A good fruitiness to balance it out. My only complaint is how high the carbonation level really is; could have toned down a bit, but I just gave it more time to breath once opened; it got much better after that. 
(D)- One of the most sour beers I have ever had; but it is very good. A huge sour kick with some good fruits; a funkiness that I appreciated & enjoyed. One of the better lambics I have ever had. Now I need to try the Kriek. Cantillon knows their sours! 1,315 characterssweemzander, May 15, 2010

Pours a muddy red brown with a pinkish hue. A bit of head builds on the pour and instant disappears to a placid top.
This is certainly one of the more acidic lambics though I don't really expect anything less from Cantillon. This one is full of woody barrel which adds a really nice dimension to the tart raspberries, lemon pucker and a hint of grapes. Some nice funk that plays with your stomach later, not a ton of carbonation but ample, a real sipper. I rate it a little less drinkable simply due to the acidic nature. 620 charactersritzkiss, May 05, 2010
3.88/5  rDev -12.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42007 vintage
A-pours a bright ruby red color with an extremely light pink colored bubbly head.
S-the nose has a hint of earthy mushroom funk to it, light sweeter oak presence, the fruits are rather bright and the raspberry is seedy and fresh, it has a hint of tartness.
T-the taste is slightly muted in comparison to the nose. the acidity picks up in the finish and detracts from the brightness of the fresh raspberries. the funk is up front and well integrated with a note of oak and earthy flavors. the rapberry in back starts sweet but the acidity really presents a problem for it to push through.
M-medium bodied beer with a slightly syrupy feel to it and high carbonation with a very dry finish.
D-put up against many other lambics and sour raspberry ales, the acidity of some of these, including this one, take away from the juicy fruit flavors you get in the nose. the integration is done very well but this would probably be best drank fresh.
2004 Vintage drank 4/10
A-pours a completely hazed orangish amber color with an egg white head the is creamy and fluffy in appearance
S-the nose is tart and sour up front with notes of acidity, a touch of lactose and funk. Tons of tart raspberries in the back.
T-this is acidic and tart, sour raspberries take over with notes of earthy musk underneath. Hints of vinegar and a light bitterness, tons of tartness at the finish.
M-medium to full body that is smooth on the palate with some light bitterness. Nice strong carbonation presence giving a good crisp finish.
D-this is tasty and tart, nice flavors and lots of raspberries. Great Brew 1,602 characterscpetrone84, May 03, 2010

A-Body is a very translucent, foggy, amber hue with a slight pinkish tint to it. Pours with a fizzy one finger white head that fades pretty quickly.
S- Nose is good and complex. The highlights are slightly tart raspberries and a big acidic sourness. Also noticeable are a hint of vinegar, a slight sweetness, and bready yeast.
T-Flavor is quite tart and offers slightly tart raspberries and a big acidic sourness with a nice bready yeast backbone. A hint of raspberry sweetness comes through for the finish which is a culmination of the initial flavors with an added salty component.
M-Acidic and sour, with low to medium carbonation and medium weight body. Quite good.
D- This is a great lambic. I wish I would have gotten into Cantillon earlier! This is a great sour that offers lots of authentic raspberry flavors and is quite tart. 884 charactersPittBeerGirl, Apr 29, 2010

Pours a stunning ruby red. Taste offers tart raspberry with a touch of oak on the finish. There was little chance of this disappointing and it assuredly didn't. While I prefer the LP Kriek to this, it's tough to imagine a framboise getting much better. 266 characterssteeltown71, Apr 21, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -7.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Mine was the 2007 vintage.
Pours a brilliant deep red, with a thin head. The beer is actually surprisingly clear for a lambic, but otherwise, it looks like I would expect it to. The smell is all fruit. Sweet fruit, candy like, maybe a bit of tartness, but almost reminds me of a fruit soda. Very nice - though sometimes you don't mind the smell of garbage in a wild ale. The flavor comes across first as tart and acidic, but it has a nice sweetness to balance. The flavor in some ways reminds me of raspberry-lime juice, if there were such a thing, also a slight sourness that is really nice, like sour candy. The taste is just surprisingly clean for a wild ale, just a nice blend of sweet and tart, with the flavor of fruit, just amazingly balanced. The bo dy is a little fuller than I expected, probably from the sweet fruit juice, and the carbonation is low, but you can tell that it's there. Fairly nice. This is really a nice beer, the sourness is there in it's fullness, but it is just held in balance with the beautiful blending and the addition of fruit. It's not too acidic, and doesn't remind you of garbage, it's just a great lambic. Really a joy to drink. 1,168 characterstaylorhamrick, Apr 06, 2010
4.19/5  rDev -5.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.52001 version, 750mL bottle with cork and cap, gifted by mikey711 in a BIF. There was a little syrupy red juice on top of the cork when I removed the cap, but after removing the cork I didn't see any other aging-related anomolies.
The beer is dark reddish-orange color, clear for the first few pours. Initially there was a big pink foam with large cell size but it disappeared quickly, leaving no bubbles at all. The aroma is strongly acidic with wild ale aromatics (barnyard, old leather) and lingering raspberry smells at the end of each sniff. 
The first sip was WAY sour, I reflexively flinched and closed my eyes. Each subsequent sip was just as bracing but my palette was ready. There's no real sweetness to be found from the raspberries, just a faint raspberry taste along with the tart acidic bite and nearly salty after-taste. This doesn't sound good as I write it but it's kinda addictive, at least I keep sipping nearly continuously.
There's lots of carbonation, otherwise a light body similar to many other lambics. Not sure how much of the puckering tartness is due to age or the particular year it was made, so I'll be getting this again as a newer year sometime to try it again. 1,195 charactersTurdFurgison, Apr 04, 2010

Who needs fresh fruit when you have Lou Pepe Framboise? The raspberry character is so marked you can feel the drupelets on your tongue. Something in the acid has kept them in stasis.
It's sour enough to remind you of a vinaigrette. A funky, oaky vinaigrette. How many vitamins are still present in this liquid? Is it feasible to make this my primary source of dietary fiber? These are the questions I ask myself.
Upending the bottle, I expect to see whole raspberries in suspension. Nope, just yeast porridge. I drink it anyway. 564 charactersalfrantzell, Mar 28, 2010

A - crazy "purple haze" for lack of a better phrase. Dense pink foam on top. 
S - tart raspberry, bit of funk
T - crisp, intense fruity flavor with a very dry finish
M - medium body, decent amount of carbonation, and of course a sour tingle thoughout
D - nice pleasant lambic. Fairly uniform - not used to paying high prices for beers without tons of complexity - but I guess Cantillon is worth it once in awhile. 449 charactersRichardberg, Mar 24, 2010

I have never smelled a beer this bad and I love funky lambics. This was not cheesy, it was not barnyard, it was not even horse-piss. This was rancid and putrid garbage. I think this was the worst beer I have ever smelled. The beer looked good, it was a cloudy reddish color. The taste was oddly pretty good despite the vomit and trash smell. I tasted funky lambic and raspberries like I expected. This was alsoa little more acidic that I would like but the smell is what killed the experience. I need to get a fresh bottle. 680 charactersArrogantB, Mar 07, 2010

Pours a cloudy reddish color with a nice off-white head that fades to a ring and spotty foam.
Aroma is very funky and tart, with a lot of raspberry and just a tiny bit of acetone/nail polish.
Flavor really jumps out at you with a huge fruit flavor. Raspberry all the way, really tart and funky, with a little nail polish, but not at all in a bad way. Really amazing taste.
Medium body with lots of long-lasting acidity. Carbonation is fairly lively despite the age on this one.
Great drinkability. Kept me wanting more of it. This is a hell of a fruit lambic, easily one of the best I've ever had. 714 charactersnickd717, Mar 04, 2010

S: Lots of raspberries in this vintage with a nice bit of sweetness from the raspberries paired with a bit of tartness and quite a bit of lactic acid, seemingly much more so than in the LP Kriek. 
T: Quite tart with a bit of sweetness. Not much acetic acid, not getting any vinegar taste like with Saint Lamnivus. Much more on the lactic side of things. Not much funk, but overall very delicious.
M: Very nice. I've gotten quite used to all types of sour, but this one actually stung my tongue quite a bit. Lots of carbonation.
D: Extremely drinkable. Low abv, very complex, and an all-around nice sipper. 710 charactersThorpe429, Mar 03, 2010
3.45/5  rDev -22.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 32007 vintage and the most expensive beer I have purchased to date at just shy of 30.00. Beautiful pour - A clear bright dark cherry color with a faint short lasting pink head. Aroma is all fresh, tart raspberries, not too sweet and vaguely woodsy. Nice. As for the rest... This may be the most sour beer I have ever tried to get down. If not, it was definitely in the running. Neither brett nor raspberry is noticeable. There is only a mouth-watering acidity, so aggressively harsh that my stomach began to recoil in horror at about the halfway point. I sat the remaining half bottle aside, to give my insides a chance to recuperate. I fully intended to have at least one more glass, but like most good intentions, I just never got around to it.
Please, for the love of god, share this beer with friends. This is a beer that should be enjoyed by the glass. Don't attempt to "man up" and consume this bottle by yourself. The results could be...troubling. 954 charactersOnibubba, Mar 01, 2010
4/5  rDev -9.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A 2002 vintage shared generously yesterday by Richard.
A: The pour is almost red rose in color with almost no head despite a fairly vigorous pour.
S: The raspberries have certainly begun to fade, but they are still very noticeable. The fruit provides a slight sweetness to the nose which nicely offsets the very acidic and tart aromas.
T: This beer is extremely acidic and doesn't have quite the fruitiness left to balance this out (but this is what you expect from Cantillon). The oak is not all that present, but there is certainly a dryness from both the wood and the fruit.
M: Due to the lack of carbonation, the beer is quite slick and smooth on the palate. The high acidity and overall tannic quality of the beer gives a very dry finish.
D: I would like to try this beer again, perhaps in a fresher state. This is certainly a very nice lambic, even with a fading fruit character. 890 characterswomencantsail, Feb 01, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The first of three Cantillon bottles, all of which showed some degree of rusting on the inner cap, but proved to be fine. This vintage was from 2005.
Pours a medium pink with a wispy white head that eventually dies to nothing. A few spots here and there, but otherwise a fairly standard lambic appearance. The nose is bizzare - balsamic vinegar, sulphur, malt vinegar, horseblanket, earth and oak. Really big for a lambic, and really sharp.
Huge sour flavour, with a barrel-load of vinegar, lemon, oak, funk in the extreme... tastes like bug heaven. Once all this dies down the raspberry starts to assert itself in a slick, slightly sticky tooth-coating fruity sweetness. Not to say that for any stretch of the imagination is this beer sweet, as a big sour finish reminds you what's really going on, but it is nice to have that added, brief sugary complexity. Other than the passing slickness the body is light and refreshing in its tartness.
This is a nicely done, complex lambic. Its not my favourite on the basis that some of the flavours simply don't jive so well with me, and at times it almost comes across as harsh. That said, a good experience, and another winner from Cantillon! 1,190 charactersbobsy, Feb 01, 2010

The beer is mostly clear with a very slight haze near the cap. Retention of the head is impressive and there is absolutely no lacing left on the glass.
Sour smell with obvious raspberries. I don't get the barnyard funky smell as much as I do a blatant sour. 
Immediate puckering blast of sour with this guy. It took me a few drinks to get my bearings and get my mouth to calm down a bit. Very sour, tart, and puckering. There is a sweet raspberry taste mixed in there, but it certainly plays second fiddle to the trademark Cantillon sour. The finish mellows to a lingering sweet-tart like memory that hangs around for quite a while
This was a very nice beer, but just seemed a bit too unbalanced. Medium bodied with a spritzy carbonated feel. The sour dominated the raspberry a bit too much for my taste, but still a very solid brew...

A: Standard pour reveals a 1.5 finger creamy, powdery colored pastel pink head with moderate retention. Beer is a semi-cloudy red rose. No lacing whatsoever. 
S: Woody skunk and sourness. Sour red fruit in the beginning is barely detectable. 
T: First sip is sooo bitingly sour. Subsequent tastes reveal a woody, moldy skunk character along with sour raspberries. Flavor is very deep and overwhelming. This beer really doesn't finish in any way. The sour character lingers on and on and on making every other sip more intense than the last. 
M: Medium bodied that borders on full. Mouth is slightly carbonated and very smooth. Finish is messy and lingers forever. I can't tell if this beer is thick from the body or from my mouth watering from the flavor. 
D: Not drinkable in the traditional sense as the flavors here are again... overwhelming. However, enjoyable and quite complex. Every bit worth seeking out and sampling. 1,030 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 03, 2010

Pours a bright, clear rose color with a large frothy pink head that quickly fades to a ring of tiny bubbles with nice lacing, though each pour from the bottle stimulates a similarly large, appealing head. 
Aroma is rich and complex, dominated by tart raspberry, slightly sweet. Underneath the fruit lies a vinegary sour, earthy aroma. Amazing balance of pungent, sharp sour notes with pleasant fruity tart and sweet. 
The sour lambic flavors take center stage in the beginning. After a few sips to condition the palate, the sweet and tart raspberry fruit flavors with some lemon zest emerge underneath the funk. Finish is extremely dry and smooth with lingering raspberry notes and mild tartness.
Silky smooth mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation, and is extremely sour and puckering from the flavors described above. A sipper from the complex flavors and sour/funkiness, but not alcohol presence, and pleasant bursts of sweetness make this an exceptional lambic. 1,018 charactersyourefragile, Dec 31, 2009

Now the face my girlfriend made when she smelt this was classic. Tart raspberries up front. Loads of acidic viniger and some great fruity yeast aromas.
Wow almost like sucking on a war head as I heard someone say. Loads of overwhelming sour raspberries slap you in the mouth. Again acidic flavors poking through, little citrus, finished with a refreshing mouth puckering sourness
Mouthfeel was puckering and tart. Decent carbonation and dry finish.

4.05/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5A - Popped the cork and poured into a St. Bernie's chalice. Pours a rather pleasant, cheery red raspberry as opposed to the brooding clotted-blood appearance of the Lou Pepe Kriek. Short, fizzy head that quickly diminishes. 
S - As soon as I popped the cork, the scent of natural raspberry filled the kitchen. This Lou Pepe does not seem to show a lot of wet wood and leather in the nose, it's just straight up fresh raspberry with a touch of perceived balsamic sour. Like the appearance, it is an exceedingly pleasant aroma that does not necessarily give away the onslaught of sour complexity that I KNOW is coming...
T - As is typical with a Lou Pepe, the first sip or two is shockingly tart. As the palate adjusts, the beer reveals layers of sour unripe raspberry, balsamic vinegar, and red-wine-like tannins. Surprisingly, not all that "funky" - the pedio/lacto certainly bring the sour, but I'm not getting any flavors typically associated with Brett....no leather, horse-blanket, sweaty armpit. It's actually kinda clean, with not much to distract from the prevailing super-sour raspberries and tannic barrel quality. 
F - This seems to have a little more carbonation than the Lou Pepe Krieks I've tried. While not overcarbonated by any stretch of the imagination, I think I'd prefer this a little closer to flat, as to me it seems to intensify the already-intense sour. 
D - It can be difficult to drink one of these alone, even though it's pretty weak ABV-wise, due to the intensity of the sour flavor. Aside from the low ABV, it kinda feels like I'm drinking a whole bottle of Merlot. While this is certainly a top-shelf lambic - and I rate accordingly - I think I prefer the Kriek. 1,695 charactersPatrick999, Dec 07, 2009

A - a solid dark magenta that fades to a watermelon pink around the edges when held to light. tiny white head composed of large bubbles that recede very quickly into a ring at the side of the glass
S - Strong sour, old fruits: very tart raspberries, with grapefruit and grapes in the back. 
T - Tart raspberry, grapefruit, and black currant are at the forefront, almost overwhelmingly so. The sour funk is the most violent flavor of this delicious brew, with almost zero booziness. the tartness mellows some as this concoction warms, bringing out softer citrus flavors like strawberry and even a bit of sweet melon. 
M - very light, slides back nicely. Perhaps a little undercarbonated. 
D - Not a session beer, but interesting and worth revisiting occasionally. 780 charactersNYCWheatFanSC, Dec 06, 2009

750ml bottle, corked and capped. 2005 vintage, bottled 10 AUG 2007. sampled nov 21/09.
pours hazy pinkish red with a small dense white head. the head drops fairly fast and leaves only a few spots of lace.
aroma is good. lemon and malt vinegar. tart raspberries. horse blanket, leather, tobacco leaf. white bread and cracker. hint of alcohol. vanilla and raw oak. bit of earthy character too. slightly phenolic.
taste is great. huge tart and sour blast, like biting into a fresh lemon. touch of cider vinegar. after a couple of sips you start to notice some of the other character. the tart raspberry comes through a little more. crackers and white bread. hint of alcohol. earthy. horse blanket. bit of leather. touch of a nutty character, like biting into a raspberry seed.
mouthfeel is good. light body and pretty much bone dry finish. puckering sourness. medium-low carbonation level.
drinkability is good. very sour, but the acidity is somewhat restrained. great depth and complexity too. i liked this one a lot. no mistaking that it's a cantillon, definitely more sour than most, but i like that end of the spectrum. good stuff! 1,180 charactersgrub, Nov 22, 2009

The aroma is wonderful. There is the great funky horse blanket similar to what you get with the Saint Lamvinus, but this is far superior to the SL because it rewards you with great notes of sweet raspberries to balance out the tart.
The taste is also equally balanced rewarding the drinker with tartness and just enough sweetnes that a true lambic follower is looking for to enhance the drinkability. The first sip is lightly sweet with a raspberries and finishes with lots of sourness. 
The mouthfeel is heavy and full and coats your mouth and makes you pucker.
Because this is so balanced its exceedingly drinkable for something so tart.
Overall, this is a great beer. I would seek this out and cellar it for up 20 years as recommended on the bottle. 987 charactersjrallen34, Nov 15, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Chilled bottle into a glass. 2007 vintage (made with 2009 harvest), purchased at the brewery and shared with some friends in London. The brewer remarked that this year's fruit crop was excellent. Reviewed from notes. 
A: Pours a hazy magenta color in the glass, with a frothy pink head that reveals its high effervescence. Retention is poor, as expected for this style, and the final result is a thin halo with no lacing down the sides. 
S: Tart, slightly sour raspberry notes hit the nose first. They are joined by oak, leather, must, and whispers of barnyard funk. 
T: Starts off seemingly sweet with a raspberry-dominated flavor, but it reveals itself to be tart, sour, very well attenuated, and uber-dry, nearly burning in the back of the throat. Swirling in the mouth and sampling the beer's myriad flavors turns up a woodsy flavor, leather, and hints hay / must / horse blanket. 
M: Acidic and cuttingly dry, reminding us of potential heartburn problems. Light-bodied and lively. 
D: Out of the 3 Lou Pepes I opened, this was our least favorite. An excellent and complex flavor, but more austerely dry than any of us really preferred. I'd get it again but I would pair it with food. 1,193 charactersArbitrator, Nov 10, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours a deep, hazy amber-red. Well carbonated, nice pink head.
Smell: HUGE, woody raspberry smell. Incredibly intense and sour. Bit of must, leather, wood, and hay.
Taste: Incredibly tart & sour, perhaps the most sour/tart beer I have ever encountered. Huge fruit as well, it is sweet but not unpleasantly so. The wood seems to add a good bit.
Mouthfeel: Very well carbonated, perhaps a bit too much so. Tannins and sugar give it a big mouthfeel
Drinkability: Drinkable, but I prefer the Kriek version (although this is better than Rose de Gambrinus, which I find to be a bit thin/watery). This one is a slow sipper. 632 characterscraytonic, Nov 01, 2009

A: Ruby red with a small pink head that leaves some lacings.
S: The smell is a bit mild with notes of raspberries, grass and mild funky notes. Not a whole lot of acidity.
T: The taste is tart with muted but clean raspberry flavors. Somewhat acidic. Notes of grass and raspberry seeds, and funky notes of mud and hey. Wood. The finish has a mild grassy bitterness to it and notes of minerals and dry raspberry notes.
M: Surprisingly full body (still moderate though) with very sparkling carbonation.
D: Good. Very drinkable. However, it seems to lack complexity and is slightly to clean in character. It seems "young", which isn't that weird since this bottle was only a couple of months old. Would probably be way better in a year or so. 783 charactersricke, Oct 22, 2009
3.7/5  rDev -16.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Out of a corked, capped, and foiled bottle, 2006 vintage. Pours a dirty plum purple color with fizzy pale pink colored head that settled into a solid ring. The aroma is of raspberry puree with some light oak and lemon. Nice and fruity, wine like. The taste is of unripe raspberries and lemon, white vinegar, pepper, and oak. Very much a tart bomb. The feel is light and very carbonated; very tart and astringent. For folks that love tart bombs and very dry brews this is an A++ but it's just not my thing. I rated mouthfeel and drinkability at a 3 because of this. 564 charactersGmann, Sep 27, 2009

T: Super, super tart with a finish of raspberries. 
MF: Light and well carbonated.
D: So incredibly tart that this is very hard to drink. Definitely a sipper.

T - Beautifully tart; fresh raspberries and wild strawberry flavors; light on the vinegar but definitely present; mild funkiness as well. Really nice
M - Thinner; effervescent carbonation
D - Really awesome for the style; refreshing and interesting but didn't wear thin and wasn't prohibitively sour

Appearance - 4.0
Pours a finger of light pink head that reduced to a thin layer over a dark red body that shines a little orange where the light catches it.
Smell - 4.5
The nose almost cringes from the sourness! Once the initial shock is over there is great depth and complexity - tart raspberry, wood, blackcurrant and wet blanket.
Taste - 4.0
Oak barrels mustiness and classic lambic notes are funky and super sour. Tart raspberry is juicy and a little sweet, but this is just drowned in the sourness and complexity. Wow!
Mouthfeel - 4.0
You have to keep the tongue moving to keep up with the tangy, sticky and lightly fizzy mouthfeel.
Drinkability - 3.0
About as expected for a traditional lambic, but the more you drink the better it is.

A- Red. That's pretty much it. A deep medium shade of the color with nothing on the surface in terms of foam. The liquid is rose colored. Some small streaks of foam on the way down, barely anything. This is pretty beer.
S- Smells like something Cantillon brewed up, no doubt about it. All the signature smells, horseyblanket/barnyard, wild yeast strain abundance with some slight oak from the barrel. Raspberry's are the theme here and they are integrated perfectly and huge in smell. This stuff really smells good so the taste should be wonderful.
T- And it is. This is one of the best Cantillon's i've had the pleasure to consume. The sourness is up there with puckering capabilities. Very fruit forward with the raspberries taking the lead with the funk towards the back. I get some oak in between and am left with linering fruit and oak afterwards. No alcohol is detected while it is rather low. This stuff is amazing.
M&D- The feel is light bodied and sour with some slight acidity. The tastes stay with you for a bit. I can't help to pucker a bit when drinking this, but that's why I drink these type beers here. Carb level is perfect in this well crafted beer/lambik. Well I had one tulip and could easily go for another, but with the high level of bacteria in this, my stomach would not thank me. 1,419 charactersBARFLYB, Aug 25, 2009

4.72/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served on draught at Belmont Station in a Delirium Tremens snifter, Lou Pepe Framboise is bright, chill hazed magenta with a medium violet collar.
Smell is super bright raspberry, whoa! Actually, it's so sweet and fruity, that the nose reminds me a lot of Lindemans, with only a hint of rubbery phenols to let em know it's a real lambic. The vintage unknown, and Belmont said they've cellared it for a year, but with this much fruit, it can't be to much older...
Taste is a whole other ballgame, pure Cantillon sour bomb. Big lambic pucker, and while the fruity is still clearly there, it struggles to balance with the pure sourness, which is exactly how I like my fruit lambics! Rounded out with a nice chalky, baking soda finish. 
Mouthfeel is slick and dry, with a medium light body and abrupt finish save for the long, lingering pucker.
Drinkability is great, this beer is the bomb. I love raspberries, and I love Cantillon, and I love this framboise. While not the sourest beer in their portfolio, and very fruit forward for a Cantillon, it still bring the pucker with loads of acidity. Super tasty, a rare treat on draught, I wish this was available year round! 1,171 charactersccrida, Jul 17, 2009
4.07/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours out an off-red with orange highlights. Speckle of white head dissipitated into near nothing on the top.
A funky aroma gives way to tart raspberries and a sweet candyish aroma, almost of sweet raspberry juice. Big, bold and sour.
Huge tartness of fresh green grape and apple skins give way to a ripe raspberry sweetness. It finishes up with tart, sour and dry pre-ripe green raspberry, which makes you long for another sip.
Beautifully well crafted and very in-depth. Possibly a bit too much for my palate to take at the moment, but easily more drinkable then a straight out geuze. A lot leaner and subtler then expected. I would like to put one away for a few years, see how it goes. 692 charactersLukie, Jul 01, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Cantillion Lou Pepe Framboise 2005
Poured from the 750ml wrapped, oversize capped, and moldy-corked bottle into a Belgian Snifter.
Appearance- Beer pours a hazed pink with a thin film of carbonation on the top that quickly mists to the sides of the glass. Lacing leaves a little bit of sticky on the sides, but that's about all there. Haze looks to have a bit of wheat in there.
Smell- Natural raspberries and that amazing trademark Cantilion yeast strain that only their fine beers possess. A wonderful leathery funk that I can't even really call brettanomyces, this funk smells completely different. Who knows what has happened to this beer after the past four years? It certainly has a uniqueness in there that I can't figure along with the pediococcus.
Taste- Tart.. Very tart and puckering, the raspberries don't taste the slightest bit fakey like some other lambics that we know of. The lingering sourness is very similiar to if you ate an entire bushel of unripe berries and it sticks to the tongue, but this is not unpleasant at all. The carbonation seems to permeate and seperate the taste buds, I hope this isn't a palate killer on the first beer of the night, but if it is, what a great beer to do it with.
Mouthfeel- Tart, puckering, medium low in carbonation, medium bodied, not warming, vinegary, effervescent.
Drinkability- Probably the best frambois I will ever have in my life, smooth, tart, lightly tingling on the lips, something I would love to have every day and I'm not the fruit beer guy. Sadly, I will likely never see it again. I need to go to Belgium! 1,583 charactersblakesell, Jun 13, 2009

A - Two and a half fingers of pink-white foam with solid retention. Absolutely no lace, but a nice cap of foam that lingers for a bit. Opaque pink-brown brew.
S - Tons of vinegar, brett-y funk, raspberries, horse blanket, and musty barn. Utterly huge smell that almost attacks the senses.
T - Huge sourness, with sweet raspberry puree right at the tip of the tongue. Lots of funk and a light graham-cracker maltiness that holds things together.
M - Super drying, tons of cotton mouth, light to medium body, moderate carbonation. More extreme in mouth pucker than even La Folie!
D - So sour - even with low ABV it's hard to have more than a a serving or two. I appreciate that Dave had the Pepto out just in case of emergency.
Looking forward to my trip to Belgium this summer... 984 charactersMasterSki, Jun 01, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap at Nova Res Cafe in Portland. Served in a bowl-ish Pinot wine glass.
Very streamlined presentation in the wine glass. Body is light raspberry red - almost glistening with a fair amount of pinkish or rose carbonation. Head is rather minimalist. Just what the doctor ordered.
Beautifully funky scent of sour, unsweetened raspberries mixed with a great Brett-ish funk. Not so heavy on the blunt horse blanket scent but more of a light poignancy with a little pine thrown in.
Taste profile is extremely clean. The tight sourness mixes nicely with raspberry essence to produce a beautiful lambic here. Finish is still very tight from piney texture and barrel character - almost as dry as balsa wood, but this is one of the classics.
Palate feel makes one pucker. Of course the sourness is overwhelming but it's done in a very clean and tight manner and doesn't negate the light dry sweetness of the raspberries. This one has a great deal of spring in its step.
I've taken a shine to the Cantillon lambics on tap ever since experiencing Fou Fonne at Deep Ellum. This one is just as enjoyable - maybe even a little more fruit character. Sure, it's tight and the funk and acidity slow it down a little bit, but who's to argue that this isn't one of the best? 1,262 charactersIBUnit63, May 27, 2009

It's an amazingly refreshing and complex thirst-quencher. It's also the kind of framboise that you can just sit and sip, slowly enjoying it. The beer pours a deep, dark, but clear red. Although it pours with a slight head, it quickly disappears. The beautiful color and clarity, however, more than make up for the head...great appearance. The aroma is a great mix of raspberries and sour funk. Horse-stall, sweaty, earthy, musty aromas mix with just-picked berries. At least half of the fun of this beer is the smell. The sourness in the taste is very strong, but not overdone. Mouthpuckering and intense, but balanced with some fruit flavors. The barnyard character comes through in the taste as well. I love these lambics that don't ruin the experience with sweetness. Perfect to sit and sip. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the drinkability on this one is fantastic. 961 charactersSuds, May 18, 2009

Very dry yet full body has an acidic finish. Perfect carbonation enhances every flavor. Perfect blend of fresh raspberries and the usual Cantillon funk. One of the best offering from Cantillon thus far. 543 charactersrye726, May 02, 2009

Slightly hazy red, you can see through it, with a quickly dissipating head.
Impressive nose, pure fruit with raspberry and a bit of cherry detectable? No, it's not really there, but has some notes of cherry. Maybe the dark roots of the raspberry.
The fruit hits right up front, with a puckering lack of any sweetness, completely dry, some sourness hits in the back, has enough malt backbone so you don't mistake it for juice, a superb refresher, aperitif. Can't really have the words about how fantastic this is, the beer of the year for me so far.
Just light and fruity in the mouth, a sipper not for the abv but for the lightness and effervescence, a good replacement for Champaign.
A highly drinkable beer, if you can find it. Great to share. 890 charactersrobbyc1, Mar 13, 2009

4.63/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Lucked into this being on tap at City Beer Store. As I have never seen this in bottles, might be my only chance to try.
The beer pours a bright pink, almost magenta with little to no head. I don't really have a frame of reference as far as how this beer looks relative to other lambics, but the color is very unique.
The nose is brett, some funk and some sweet raspberries to balance things out.
This was a great tasting beer, and very complex. While cold, the raspberries dominate. The funk, a combination of sour and spicy, is more noticeable on the back of the palate. As the beer warms, the fruitiness is less noticeable, and the acidity and sour flavors are more evident. I am not sure if this had more to do with the warming of the beer or whether I was simply less aware of the fruit as I drank the beer. The combination of fruitiness and acidity were ideal.
This is not a beer that I would want to have every day or one I would want to consume in great quantities. I very much enjoyed this - more than I would have anticipated - and am hoping to explore a bit more of this style. Absolutely give this beer a try if you see it. 1,138 charactersyeastsipper, Jan 24, 2009

Smells ... like whole raspberries along with some oaky twigs were pitched whole into this brew. Acidic/vinegar evident in the nose.
Taste is very, very nice. Sour, tart, but with a residual raspberry sweetness. Raspberries are very evident here. Seems to sparkle on the tongue. It's really oaky/tannin-y, and there's definite vinegar/acid running through it, but the fruit takes center stage.
Lively mouthfeel.

T: Again, sour and tart raspberries. Almost mouth puckering. A funkiness that follows the nose. Not bad, but not a lot of depth and too much sourness for my tastes.
M/D: A medium body and medium carbonation. Dry. The sourness makes this hard to drink.
This one did not do it for me like the Lou Pepe Kriek did. The subtle complexities that are in the Kriek are almost gone here. What is here is raspberries, sourness, and funk. Not that that is bad, just not the masterpiece the Kriek is. 729 characterschamp103, Jan 10, 2009

A-Is a cloudy red with some pink. There wasn't any head to speak off when brought to me.
S-Is a funky raspberry (sounds like a dance) with a combined tart & sweet aroma.
T-Is flavorful, tart raspberries with the funk but has some fruit sweetness as well. Maybe it was just me, as a sour/tart fan, but this beer does not seem to be overly tart or funky, just right.

Pours a beautiful reddish orange with good clarity as long as you avoid the accumulated sludge in the bottom of the bottle. Sour and barnyard aromas intertwined with delicate raspberries are what you notice when you take a whiff. Personally, I like the depth that the kriek has, since I think it hold up better to the sourness, but this is very nice as well. The raspberries are somewhat light, but very acetic and the barnyard notes are just right- wonderful, they are there withouth being overwhelming and add a complex note to the aroma. The taste is extremely tart, maybe too much so. I would like to see some more fruitiness to balance the extreme acidity. Even so, the raspberry notes are laser-like in intensity, and to be fair there is an initial burst of fruit, and a savory, sour creaminess at the end. The mouthfeel is brilliantly sharp and tart followed by a soft, salty, creaminess. This is a little challenging- definitely a sipper, but fascinating. 1,020 charactersGeorgiabeer, Dec 18, 2008

S: Almost a "meaty" smell to it, can't really put my finger on it. Raspberry is there, you can also smell the incoming sourness that will hit in the taste department and some wood. Very complex.
T: Sour, obviously, thought I'd get that out of the way. Raspberry is very well done, subtle, giving way to more fruity flavors such as grape and a bit of grapefruit character.
M/D: Light bodied, carbonation is heavy. A beer to be sipped, the sourness can be too much, but with low alcohol it's certainly one that can be had in larger quantities over a long period of time. 765 charactersNCSUdo, Nov 28, 2008

Smell is strawberry times 10!. Sugar and caramel and some yeast.
Taste is sour strawberry with a darkness like a hop or some sort of grass.
Mouthfeel is very clean and not oily at all.
Drinkability is high here If I could get more! 349 characterspeabody, Nov 15, 2008

Thanks to knight84 for sharing this bottle! Pours a tawny pink to ruby red grapefruit with a slight haze. Cottony, pinkish-white head stays around a while and climbs up the glass nicely. Very nice. Intense nose of total and utter undomesticated critters and their funky, musty byproducts. Attic cobwebs mix with horse blanket and almost-rotten raspberries and raspberry seeds. Tart, fruity sourness permeates. Wow. 
Not surprisingly, the taste features assertive, puckering sourness. It is a little overwhelming at first, but after a few sips, other flavors make themselves known. Tart fruit, raspberry and grapefruit, and a slightly metallic hay taste. Acidic sourness clearly dominates and makes for a very dry, refreshing palate. Raspberry seeds mix with lemon juice in the finish. Medium bodied with a tickle-y feel. 868 charactersalexgash, Oct 31, 2008

Intense pucker, sweetness overwhelmed by tartness. Really a palate shocker, but in a good way. Horse blanket is limited, but present.
Mouthfeel is dry and tart.
Drinkability is limited by your enjoyment of tart. I really liked this brew. 321 charactersghostwalker, Oct 28, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52005 Vintage.
A: Pours a vibrant but murky fruitpunch color with a multi-finger fizzy light-pink head that settles to a ring and blanket. 
S: Woah, loads of brett and funkiness. These aromas flooded the room as soon as popped the cork. Also some astringent grassy, barnyard aromas.There may be some underlying raspberry sweetness but its so faint and so overpowered by the aforementioned that it's barely noticeable. 
T: Sour and tart as all hell. It's still mouth puckering into the second and third glass -- I love it. At the same time it's sweet and refreshing, though the sourness more than dominates. I honestly wouldn't be able to pinpoint raspberry as the primary fruit if I didn't know ahead of time. As it warms, some of the oak comes through on the finish. 
M: Loads of prickly champagne-like carbonation, medium bodied and velvety.
D: This is certainly a sipper, but I'm going to have no problem taking down this champagne bottle on my own, especially given the light ABV. Beyond that, I think many would be soured out and up for something sweet. 1,062 characterskasper, Oct 22, 2008

Aromas of raspberry, rose, funk, earth, and nettles. Flavors consist of more raspberry, lemon zest, and a bit of lactic funk on the finish. Wickedly acidic! It practically burned going down, but was so refreshing and tasty. Near perfect for someone like me who can't get enough sour/acidic flavors. I'm going to need to track down more of this stuff. 447 charactersfisherman34, Aug 27, 2008

Poured into a wine glass deep, clear red grape color with almost no head. Aroma is sour funk and lots of raspberry's. Taste is raspberry and funk. Quite acidic, a most puckering experience. Crisp carbonation. I really liked this one, but its not for the faint of heart as the sourness of this one was intense. 352 charactersjohnnnniee, Aug 02, 2008

Pours a clear reddish/purple with no head, just some small bubbles of carbonation up the side of the wine glass. 
Smells of rasberries, mostly, but some barnyard and some sour cherries and apples.
Taste is similiar to smell- lots o fsweet rasberry with the tartness of sour fruits as well. Little bit of red wine flavor as well. Quite refreshing, though. Little bit of spritz in there. Not as hardcore as I thought. Very good. 547 charactersDrDogbeer, Aug 01, 2008

S - wow! Very clear raspberry smell, with a hint of funky goodness.
T/M/D - very tart, not too sweet but not too dry, with a delicate taste of raspberry (not as noticeable as in the smell, and far from syrupy - typical of Cantillon). The sourness lingers for a bit too, enough to entice another sip. Outstanding, if you like your lambics nice and tart! 409 charactersJerico, Jul 06, 2008

I'm not a big "fruited" beer person, I believe this is packed with cherries and or other things though this was debated at Hamiltons. Amazing red and pink color, some froth, and sparkle to it. Intriguing how it hit the palate, sizzles, then poof dissapears, then a drawn out mineral, sour and balanced finished. The back of a bottle notes the beer can be enjoyable for 20+ years? I'd love to try a 1988 bottle! Luckly found some and will be aging them. A real treat. 485 characterspaytoplay, Jun 22, 2008

Tart and dry flavors of raspberries it reminded me of a raspberry sweet tart with just a slight tingle of carbonation on the tongue

3.97/5  rDev -10.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.52005 vintage on tap at the Malt House in Madison, WI on its opening night. $10 for a tulip glass.
Appearance: Raspberry vinegar colored dark pink. Beautiful color. No head and almost no bubbles. Flattish. Probably much better looking out of a bottle at least when reasonably young, or, as I have experienced with other kegged Cantillon, this may look better after a few chalices have been served and a few weeks in the keg have allowed this puppy to build a little carbonation. That may sound crazy but it's damn sure what happened to the last keg of Vigneronne I drank from.
Aroma: Huge aroma of raspberries and raspberry juice, plenty of lovely funk, barn yard notes, horse urine, acidic grape skins, very astringent.
Taste: Front is all raspberry and the back is all funk. Pretty cool flavors. The grape skin astringency comes through. The fruit is just magnificent and steady amounts of barnyard goodness beat upon the palate. Yum.
Mouthfeel: Very acidic and without carbonation this becomes hard to take in large doses. Still, it is not unbalanced and generally light to medium bodied. Carbonation would be a big improvement and I will be curious to try this in the bottle when I visit in Belgium in two months to see how it is different.
Drinkability: Not very good. This is a tough one to drink. The acid really gets to my tongue and throat in a much bigger way than most lambics have. I wouldn't want to many of these but again, this could be very different with a bottled version. 1,494 charactersDaPeculierDane, Jun 10, 2008

Label reads 2005. Cork 2007.
Pours a hazed ruby. Nose is funk. Flavor is sour indeed, but I find it more one-dimensional than I recall the Lou Pepe Kriek being. It's tart, it's slightly fruity, and that's about it. Carbonation has a bit of a bite to it. This is nice and drinkable, yes. You've gotta be ready for the lambic qualities (the sour) to enjoy it best. And like I said it's not quite complex like the Lou Pepe Kriek. 524 charactersRblWthACoz, May 27, 2008
4.4/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750ml capped and corked bottle.
Appearance: Hazy bright red, very pretty stuff. The head rises about an inch and lasts a bit longer than the average lambic, but ultimately settles into a ring.
Smell: A good bit of complex funk blended nicely with raspberries and lemon juice.
Taste/mouthfeel: An exceptional tart raspberry flavor is the first thing that hits the palate with some buggy undertones beneath it. Bone-dry throughout, the sourness and acidity are strong but quite palatable. Raspberries come out even more in the finish, lingering on the tongue for several minutes between sips. The acidity does become a bit stomach-churning after a while with this one, which knocks it down a bit compared to many of Cantillon's other beers. A top notch framboise all the same. 777 characterslargadeer, May 15, 2008

Aroma of raspberry is dominant with some sour notes as well as some barnyard notes and a weird cough syrup-like finish. Taste is dry with some notes of sour raspberry and some limited acidic notes which I appreciated since I usually find the Cantillon lambic a bit too acid. Full body with some great carbonation. I thought this was really good but I good have done without the weird raspberry syrup-like aftertaste. 578 charactersPhyl21ca, May 01, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep berry colored beer with a short pink head. Potent aroma of fresh tart raspberries over a bit of lemon and cotton candy. Tart, sour flavor. Mostly lemon up front with mildly sour raspberries towards the finish. This is definitely a sipper, unless you normally suck on lemons. Can sour go in the mouthfeel too? Besides sour there isn't any carbonation and the body is well... average? It's hard to say. It's a Lambic with raspberries, and I think the raspberries make it more drinkable. It's really hard to assign numbers to this one so take them with a grain of salt. 579 charactersHappyHourHero, Apr 27, 2008

This a sour tart bomb that is more vinegar than anything, and it completely killed my palette. 
It looked good, had a nice aroma of fruit and the CO2. Very very slight hint of the yeast. 
However, the moment the Pepe hit the tongue I could feel it melting the taste buds. Complex fruit is immediately overwhelmed by the acidity. Almost an astringent/medicinal character. I love sour and wild beers but this was absolutely too much. Keg get heated up too much? I don't know.
I had to pass off the chalice after a few sips. It took several pieces of water crackers and a glass of water to cleanse my mouth. Probably good for cleaning stuff. Disappointing since I love everything else I have had from Cantillon. 751 charactersmrkrispy, Apr 23, 2008

A: Pours a vibrant, pure red colour, with a firm, though a little fizzy pink head, good lacing and retention.
S: Raspberry juice and horse blankets.
T: Tart raspberry juice with a surprising sweetness that I don't expect in Cantillon beers. The funk is there - it's on the lighter side, with an acetic finish.
M: Tart, acidic, dry for a fruit beer, spritzy carbonation.
D: A good lambic from Cantillon, didn't wow me like I expected it to, but a solid effort, would make an interesting dessert pairing. 542 charactersHalcyondays, Mar 17, 2008

Poured an translucent and hazy red with a large foamy pink head.
The aroma was bursting with fresh raspberries - what I'd describe as "jammy." Lots of brettanomyces barnyard funk and lactic acid.
The flavor was pretty tart and acidic. The fruit flavors wer very rich a full. Huge raspberry flavor. The beer had a clean biscuity and wheaty malt backbone (very subtle, but nice).
The carbonation was spritzy the mouthfeel was light and crisp.
This beer was incredibly refreshing, as are all Cantillons, and extremely drinkable.
One of the most intensely flavorful lambics I've had. 599 charactersSacoDeToro, Mar 13, 2008

A - Poured a brilliant bright red, almost a hot pink color with a huge frothy and fizzy head of pink colored foam that rose up a good three fingers high from the top. Now that I think about it, this was a perfect rose color. Lots of carbonation could be seen through haze and cloudiness of it. This one left behind lots of side glass lace as well. Very nice presentation and about what I would have expected coming into this.
S - The aroma was highly tart and sour, and I mean highly tart and sour, almost had to kick my head back at the first sip. Big aromas of rasberry and just sour fruit in general. Lots of yeast here really made this thing come alive. As it warmed it just started to roll through some wonderful aromas of oak and would with hints of sugar mixed in for good balance. Very big smell here, very big and nice. I could literally pick this one up from across the room, it was just that strong.
T - The flavor was huge here. The very first sip set me back a bit as the sourness and tart rasberry flavors were on full display here. Really one of the more tart flavors I have seen. There were hints of the oak throughout it, but they were lighter then what you find in some of the oaked stouts and strong ales. Lots of yeast and a touch of sugar in and around the rasberry flavors, trying to lighten it up a bit. Nice depth to the flavor as it displayed several layers as it warmed. The finish was just as strong bringing with it a huge dried out sour finish that puckered your lips and made you have to go back and have another sip almost immediatly.
M - Very smooth and light bodied this was definitly a very nice lambic. There was loads of carbonation inside here really frothing over and showcasing the flavors perfectly. The overall feel was very crisp and clean, nothing doting around or getting too thin or too thick, but rather just right in the middle with a very nice overall feel to it.
D - This was definitly a sipper, not due to the high alcohol content or anything but mostly due simply to how sour this one was coming off. It was hard to take more then just a sip of this, but why would you want to this is one to really sit back and enjoy, to really savor each and every sip of. 
Overall I thought this was a really nice brew. I have been getting into these more exotic belgians and this one just furthered my curiousity to delve further into them. It was a bit differnet then anything I had of the style before and this was a nice welcomed change. I would love to try this one again, though it is a tad pricey so we shall see. 2,700 charactersmikesgroove, Jan 01, 2008

Appearance: Pours a ruby red color with a little bit of carbonation and some lacing. as with other lambics, plenty of clinging bubbless.
Smell: Funky, horseblanket of aromas, much like a barnyard. Raspberry and wood are very present as well. 
Taste: Much like the smell, the taste is loaded with raspberry, in a tart way. There is minimal carbonation here, with cherry tartness that lurks around in my mouth.
Mouthfeel: Intensely tart and sour. You have to be ready for something like this before you go off playing around. Otherwise, the beer has a mellowing effect on myself and my senses. Sublime I guess you would call it.
Drinkability: Not an every day drinker by any means. This beer would best be served as an aperitif or perhaps a digestif depending on the meal and courses. This beer would get consumed more if it weren't for the heavy price tag. 966 charactersRisser09, Aug 08, 2007
4.27/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.52002 bottling.
The first half of the bottle pours a clear, resonant, cherry juice brown, capped by a fizzy, sputtering head that dies away immediately like cola. Amazing color, very pretty. The remaining pours get steadily hazier, until the last dregs are an opaque, purplish, brick red mud. I wasn't that brave. The aroma is bitingly acidic, lightly tinted with raspberry essence. Funky and wild, with notes of aged swiss cheese and crabapple. Very complex and farmy. The flavor is immediately and unequivocally tart. Sour with just the slightest bit of give to keep your eyes from watering. The raspberry flavor comes through mostly in the end. It's sort of a raspberry apology for what your tastebuds just went through. Funky and wild through and through, very acidic with little in the way of sweetness or bitterness. Moldy and bacterial, with light cheesy sharpness and vinegar notes. Light on the tongue, with fizzy, energetic carbonation that carries the flavors well. Very challenging and unique. Delicious, but the sourness gets almost painful after half a bottle. Funny, because I recall easily splitting a bottle of the Fou'foune with the old lady, and that's one of their most intense. Something to share with a couple friends. Hopefully they chip in on the big pricetag, too! 1,289 charactersUnionMade, Jul 30, 2007

The beer poured a hazy bright red color with a slight carbonated body and a dull pink head. The nose was nice and funky as expected with some fresh raspberry notes. The taste was one of those nice pucker up tart tastes to be expected for a gem like Cantillon. The raspberries tasted so real and refreshing. Despite the tartness, this was a very easy drinking beer and had a nice peppery taste on the back end. 472 charactersggaughan, Apr 14, 2007
4.32/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4It pours a rich fruit-punch red, with pinkish lights along the edges. Two fingers of light pink head swells at the tap but disappears to thin air by the time it gets to me. One single ring of lacing halos the dropping liquid. 
The aroma is of the earth, with yeast and funk, horse and hay, wet and musty, and overseen by the lord of it all, the mighty fresh raspberry, both sweet and tart, but with an acidic blade that punches the fruit home. 
Upon sipping, the dense earthiness again makes first play, with the sour funky attitude bouncing off the deep candied sweetness of the raspberries, with the result a densely tart, citric pucker, the cheeks sucked in, the tongue ravaged, and the nose wrinkled. The fading glory is more reminiscent of grapes, not quite vinous but stately as opposed to juicy. A distant florality graces the sour but prompt finish. It's fruity and might lead you to expect something more conservative, but woe is the one who believes that for even a moment, because it's a fine, sour saucy lambic. 
Light of body, there's a sense of carbonation and a dry impression that clean the palate after each mouthful. 
The guy I was with insisted on trying it, and far be it from me to dissuade him. The instant response was no way, this is not my kind of beer. My wife didn't like it. Some guy I didn't know asked me how I can drink it. I replied, with relish. More for me, lads and lassies, and for anyone who wants to enjoy a sour fruity back-to-the-soil basicness that gives a good lambic its soul. Granted, it takes a couple glasses of water to get my cheeks puffed back out where they belong, but what a wonderful sipper this is. Sure, it's not for everyone, but it is for me. 1,711 charactersFoxman, Apr 03, 2007
4.64/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - Dark reddish pink. By the time it got to me it had almost no head, just a tiny ring of foam clinging to the wall of the glass.
S - Absolutely spectacular aroma. Complex earthyness and distinct wild yeast notes support an ideal raspberry fruitiness. Woody, with vanilla notes, and just a hint of the profound acidity that waits in the flavor. I couldn't stop swirling and smelling this one.
T - Strong acidity, as I have come to expect from Cantillion lambics. Many of the same earthy notes that are found in the aroma, followed by a dark, raspberry flavor. Some subtile vanilla as well.
M - Quite dry with fairly low carbonation.
D - Wonderfull beer, I had it by itself but it seems like it would be a great match for just about any dessert. That being said, it is hard to imagine drinking more than one glass of this beer. 831 charactersnickfl, Mar 26, 2007

It was interesting. This was one of the first beers of the night and I thought wow this is really sour. Later when we came back to it. I really appreciated the deep rich fruit flavors and amount of depth that showed through all the intense funk in this beautiful beer. 
Initially my wife thought she would like a raspberry beer. She didn't. This is not a transition beer. It is not a fruity for the timid. It is a serious sour done just right.
Appearance: Pours a red color with w fluffy white head that has hints of pink and finally fades to a pick color around that glass. Heavy lacing.
Smell: Raspberries galore. Bold tart raspberries absolutely sour and yet like putting your face in a plate full of squishy overripe berries. At the same time is is wine like, and certainly sour horse blanket musty leather old rotten wooden barrel aromas as well.
Taste: It is exactly like the nose but bigger now in the mouth with rich sour raspberries overripe grapes, lemon peels with an intense pucker effect like sucking on a lemon but it is a woody funky fruity flavor. MARVELOUS!
Mouthfeel: Sharp intense sour makes it a bit rough through the mouth at first but the aftertaste it so magnificent you rush right back into that bubbly babe of beer.
Drinkability: I've got drink it nice and easy but slow and steady wins the race every time, and though it may be a rough ride I enjoy every second of it. I repeat this is a fruit beer! It is a real Lambic with fruit.
Hope this is helpful.

Smells like candied raspberries. It's nice, but there's no huge lambic presence like I was expecting, no yeast funk or anything.
Tastes.. YEE OW! Calm start, the candied raspberries of the nose. But then the back is this wonderful kick of sour deathfunk yeast and perfectly permented sweet and sour fruit and big bursts of heaven. Wonderful. 478 charactersmynie, Mar 12, 2007

4.77/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours an appealing reddish pink with a cacophonous head that dissapears immediately and leaves only a little lacing. The aroma is full of lambic funk and fleshy raspberry pulp. Mildly sweet but more tart, the fruit is the dominant character in the nose. The taste is very funky and very sour as you would expect from Cantillon but there is a sweeter fruit flavor than usual (though the beer is still bone dry). Wet hay and a horseblanket show in spades as the beer warms. The finish is sour and pithy with raspberry skins. The mouthfeel is light with a sparse, bubbly carbonation. 
This is a fanastic fruit lambic. Very fruity and very tart. If Cantillon Kriek and RDG are too sour, maybe you'd like this more. 713 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Jan 17, 2007

Light red, almost pink, no head, bubbles, medium carbonation
Smells sour, then like raspberry, then there's that Cantillon fishy smell way back in the distance, overall pleasant though
Tastes, sour, dry, a little watery, the raspberry is there, but not very pronounced, then a bitter acid sour aftertaste, this will wake you up.
Mouthfeel is light and bubbly
Overall drinkability is dependant on your predilection toward the super sour fruit taste and tolerance for the slightly funky smell and acid bitterness. If you like it sour then this will hit the spot. 582 charactersstoner420, Aug 10, 2006

S: Sour, wood, acetic acid, very floral with lots of pungent mystery yeasts.
T: Wow. Very dry and refined. Nothing like the other framboises on the market. Extremely tart with flashes of bittering hops. Rounded rose pedal notes mellow on the tongue creating B vitamin moments on the tongue. The raspberry flavors are fairly subdued with the lambic flavors taking the limelight

Appearance: Pours a hazy deep red with a thin white fizzy head that quickly dissipates. Sparse bubbles rise up the sides of the glass to create a patchy thin ring.
Smell: Aromas of raspberries, sourness, and an intense funky wet blanket aroma.
Taste): The characteristic lambic flavors are present. There's an acidic tartness that greets the palate. It mellows into fruity raspberry flavors. The sourness reasserts itself in the finish, though not as much as some of Cantillon's other offerings. Funky lambic flavors are also present in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Lightly carbonated, light-bodied with a puckering sourness and dry finish.
Drinkability: Like most lambics, Lou Pepe Framboise is a sipping beer.
Overall: An excellent lambic. The fruitiness is much more evident in this beer than in other Cantillon beers that I've had. 1,041 charactersEPICAC, Jun 30, 2006

This one is very yummy. It pours a blood red with a quickly receding head. I love the classicl Cantillon absurd tartness, but I also dig the way the rasperry flavor lingers in the mouth. It is obviously very sour, but also a very enjoyable drink. 300 charactersbignick, May 24, 2006

Extremely rich, authentic and elegant raspberry aroma, with an apple core aroma underneath. Upon tasting, it had a very unpleasant and distracting apple like lambic character in the blend, which to me, showed more applely lambic flavor, than raspberry fruit. Im a lambic beginner, but it just seemed well, not very complex. Just like the Lou Pepe Kriek, I wish an older blend was used (rather than just two year), yielding more tartness, but my biggest complaint is the flavor of the lambic blend, not the fruit. 599 charactersCrosling, Mar 16, 2006

Bottle dated 2001, cork 2003.
Pours with huge head, which quickly reduces to either nothing or 1/3cm white foam alternately. wonderful astringent acidic sour nose with clear raspberry notes - unlike their kriek, the fruit note here is very distinct and clear.
taste is overpoweringly acidic at first, but quickly diminishes, leaving a muted aftertaste of primarily of raspberry without much tartness. there is heavy carbonation in the taste as well.
I let the bottle sit over half an hour drinking slowly, and temperature finally reaches more reasonable levels. The acidic taste increases but I never get much aftertaste. Of course, this beer was bottled over two years ago, I have usually not had good results myself aging fruit lambics and perhaps that is the case here.
I had this beer when it was first released but have no clear memory of it - but at this point, owning none myself, drinking it in a place such as monk's may be the only option, temperature mishandling and all. 1,153 charactersdogfooddog, Mar 10, 2006

Appearance: Brownish and quite murky, like most Cantillons the head was lively at first but died off rapidly.
Smell: Crush some sour, unripe raspberries, stick that jam into a well used baseball glove and leave it between two bales of hay during a rainy October and that's what this Beer smells like. I kid you not.
Taste: A bit more fruity than a kriek, but the difference is almost negligible. The acidity beats up your tongue and bullies your taste buds for it's lunch money. Like the Parliament Funkadelic is jamming in my mouth! 579 charactersGoldorak, Oct 25, 2005

Enjoyed as a 4oz sample at the Belgian Beer Fest 2004. They were out of Gueuze, so this was sampled instead. Man, I'm glad I did. My first TRUE fruit lambic! Pours a unique, glowing, deep, opaque red. Amazingly deep red! No head, very light carbonation, despite being on draft. Regardless, a beautiful beer. Smell is sweet and of raspberries. Taste is remarkably sour, bold, tangy, and almost uniformly raspberry flavored.Though I lack a deep base knowledge for comparison, I was told this is one of the best fruit lambics, and I believe it. Truly excellent. 582 charactersRocketWidget, Mar 26, 2005

Appearance: Orange-tinted mahogany color, very hazy. Big head at first, but settles down quickly. 
Aroma: Wonderful, fully funky aroma: cheesy, old leather, sharply metallic, with an underlying raspberry tartness.
Flavor: Very tart, puckeringly tart and acidic. Fruity, but not identifiably raspberry, as all trace of sugar content is gone; instead it feels almost citric, like an old, almost dried-out lime. Sweaty and leathery lambic flavors are present as well. Finishes quite dry.
Mouthfeel: Fairly light body, but the pungent tartness gives a really great texture.
A beautiful beer. Framboises are my favorite fruit lambics, and this example is one of the best. 737 charactersallengarvin, Feb 05, 2005

4.77/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Framboise 2001 Vintage:
Presentation: Like a Pornographic Magazine I spotted this seriously sexy offering looking all hot & cumly & staring down at me from the top shelf, it begged me to buy it. It didnt take much to convince me. Cost me all of $13.99, you have to be kidding me right?! The typical 750ml Cantillon green glass bottle comes with a cork/crown cap which is covered in a high quality thick externally black colored silver foil that covers the slender neck for about 5. Once the foil & crown cap were removed it revealed a pristine cork that immediately started to bubble, this is still a lovely beast & most certainly could handle more aging but Im impatient to try this now. The main obverse label is a generic one for the Lou Pepe, & it has a picture of the area around Mannekin Piss statute, which is also the view seen from the Poechenellekelder. A small oval sticker above the main obverse label lists this as Framboise 2001, the cork has a bottled (misspelled botteld LOL) date of 2.003. The Lou Pepe range was created to mark the handing over of Brewster activities at Cantillon from father (Jean-Pierre) to son (Jean). The Lou Pepe Framboise is one of the better 2-yr old lambics steeped with 50% more Raspberries (300g/l as opposed to 200g/l) than its standard stable mate Framboise [better known as Rosé de Gambrinus] & reinvigorated with a sweet liquor sugar solution. Bordeaux barrels are also used, lending some further unique flavors to this special Vintage Framboise.
Appearance: Partially decanted from the 750ml into a large 1 Pt Jug, from which I then poured & topped up my chosen drinking vessel, a straight sided Cantillon tumbler. Superb looks, a supremely awesome totally clear looking reddish-pink color that looks medicinal. A thick but consistent flamingo pink head forms & fizzes for all its worth, volcanic at times the bubbles in the head rise & fall with a lava like bubbly residue. The effervescent rousing is audibly loud, but when this rescinds & the quiet returns, there is a bereft sliver like pink halo & a small broken floating thin island in the middle of the Jug, yet once it is poured from the Jug to the Cantillon Tumbler a huge voluminous pinkish head forms again. Bloody Hell this is Seriously Sexy!
Nose: Classically Cantillon, sharp & extremely pungent yet somehow seriously fucking fruity in a manner only the Van Roys seem to be able to accomplish set against the backdrop of traditional lambic. Not much Anderlecht funk in this one though, the horse piss & cow shit is replaced with a pronounced yet mild wild yeast character that has strong Raspberry vinegar traits which are very dominant, as are the sharp red berries & acidic grape skins which all work together to give a bloody impressive all-round cutting fruity nose that will sting any open wound with a vicious biting. It is never demeaning to apply the term astringent with Cantillon; it is merely an appreciative sign of a deep understanding & a comprehensible complement of their offerings. 
Taste: Majestic raspberry multiple orgasms soak the lambic clitoris with a fruity & very tasty berry juice that begs to be licked clean from the nether regions, again & again, then spread over the luscious red skinned labia. A sharp, yet incredibly smooth shaven raver that advances from the initial Raspberries with the best worst? parts of an acrid 2 year old lambic to produce a Forbidden Fruit drink that makes you feel guilty of such pleasure. Saliva removing finish that can make you believe that your lips just vaporized. Drier than Ghandis Sandals.
Mouthfeel: Acrid, acidic, sharp, cutting yet fruity in a smooth vinegary testicle-yanking Cantillon sort of way. Selfish masturbatory influences on the tongue as you lick your own lips after this one.
Drinkability: As I will always freely admit, I am deeply biased when it comes to traditional lambics, especially Cantillon, but yet again I find myself quite literally blown away by the sheer quality & individuality of this Framboise which is completely unswerving & unapologetic in its sheer dedication to making your love organs shrink. 
Excuse me whilst I now go searching for my testiclesI know theyre round here somewhere. 
Overall: Of all the fruit-lambics, Framboise never seems to get a serious look in, its the more "Girlie" of the commercial fruity beers & is easily misunderstood as a 'Liquid Panty Remover' when essence or syrup is used - yet when the real deal fruit is used in a truly authentic lambic, it produces an incredibly dry offering that is the anti-thesis of the more commercial sweet Liquid Panty Removers that are out there. Raspberries will never give the overall satisfying feel that Cherries will I feel; due to their more restrained profile, but don't underestimate the bite of a traditional Framboise for the sweet sickly crap that you may have had previously. Along with Drie Fonteinen Framboise  this is the Premiere offering of its ilk. F'in Fantastic!! 5,034 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Oct 20, 2004
4.4/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5On Tap at the Moan and Dove:
This beer poured a hazy light red color with just the faintest of faint offwhite ruby heads leaving no lace on the glass. Aromas are pungent and tart, with raspberry being just noticeable in the picture along with horseblanket barnyard funk. The initially flavor to this brew is quite acidic and tart, which is overlapped on top of a bed of faint raspberry flavors. Some other fruity tones make their way into the picture but are mostly overwhelmed by the beautiful lambic tart and sour notes. This brew is fairly light bodied but just full of flavor with only a slight carbonation. Considering I had 3 of these magnificent brews while at the Moan I would have to rate the drinkablity of beer to be top notch. A great offering from Cantillon and just amazing that it was on draft at the Dove. 824 charactersbigbeerdrinka, Aug 22, 2004

Quite a treat to see this availble in a keg. (Thanks Tom!)
Beer arrives in the glass a deep rich red purple with a light haze and a low almost non-existant pinkish head. 
The aroma is of grapeskins followed by a seedy aroma from a highly acidic fruit. The Cantillon funk seems to be missing or muted in this particular brew.
Flavor matches up with the aroma fufilling a spicy tannic berry bite, but curiously soft on the acid compared to the more traditional Cantillon products.
Still tasty as hell. 577 charactersdrewbage, Aug 11, 2004
4.52/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Served up at O'Brien's during the 24 July BA gathering. Presented in a goblet, this Cantillon offering had a dark ruby red color, kind of like dried blood, and a thin fizzy pinkish head.
The nose was subdued and more in line with some other, more "traditional" framboises I've sampled. The trademark Cantillon barnyard funk was toned down, allowing the aroma of dried raspberries and yeasty malt to come through. The musty, wet animal hide and leather aroma was still present but the raspberry stood well on its own.
A sip and I was rewarded with an immediate imploding of my cheeks thanks to the puckery tartness. "Bitter beer face" doesn't stand a chance against the features-warping ability of Cantillon. Lou Pepe Framboise delivered a delightful blend of sweet (barely) and sour (lots) raspberry flavor, mild wheaty maltiness, and a dash of those funk notes. It all finished with more tart raspberry goodness. No cloying syrupy sweetness; just raspberries, mainly tart with a bit of sweet. The feel was medium-bodied, smooth and dry.
Oh man, I could drink this all day! I love raspberries and this just hit the spot dead-on for me. On-tap, Cantillon's Lou Pepe Framboise is aces. 1,186 charactersBoilermaker88, Jul 27, 2004
4.25/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bloody light red, very thin pink head. Aroma is extremely barnyardy, like when you pick raspberries in a field where cows have passed and left their "trace". Lactic sour yogurt past its prime, mild cask wood. Very fruity acidic palate, citric, lactic with definite blood oranges flavors. I think Id like it better if it was more sour. Cask wood flavors, while there, seems also a bit restrained to me. Medium carbonation, medium bodied. Those beers are great, no doubt about it, but I guess its the oak and fruit focus that makes the difference between a great beer and an exceptional one. Lou pepe framboise, while very complex and apparently well blended doesnt strike to me as the perfect blend of complexity and focus. I had greatly anticipated this beer for a long time and stand disappointed though, its fairly similar to the lou pepe kriek and while being authentic and a quality product, just doesnt appear to me even as a top shelf framboise and how many of those are there? Thanks Martin! 1,008 charactersRastacouere, Jun 07, 2004
4.7/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52001 Edition.
Deep hazy red with a slight touch of onion skin. Foam was oozing out of the bottle upon opening, and was enthusiastic upon pouring, but, in typical Cantillon fashion, quickly dissipated in the glass.
Absolutely stunning nose of pure wild raspberry supported by acidic citrus notes. Touch of funk, but much more subdued than most Cantillons. Still obviously a traditional lambic, but the quality of the raspberry is like nothing I've smelt.
Typical Cantillon in the mouth. A bit surprising, given the richness that the extra fruit and barrel treatment gave the nose. Tart citrus dominates, with a bit of crisp crackery grain making itself known. Finish is unbelievably long.
Beautifully carbonated, and a lovely mouthfeel. As easy to drink as any Cantillon, although the transition between the richness of the nose and the typicity of the palate is a bit distracting. 892 charactersRealale, May 15, 2004
3.48/5  rDev -21.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Vintage 2002, decanted
The Lou Pepe Framboise does exhibit a stronger fruit character than most Cantillon, as was the goal of this line of lambic, but is as dry and acidic as any other. The Brett character is sacrificed in this beer to mouthwatering tartness. And though much of this comes from the raspberries, I find it difficult really to distinguish the fruit character from the lambic itself. It is in what it isn't -- Lou Pepe Framboise is not earthy or woody -- but to say that this is a fruit bomb would be a huge overstatement.
The Framboise is still prototypically Cantillon with so much acidity that you'll think you're drinking an ulcer or a very, very tight wine. And by adding more fruit and sacrificing a lot of that classic funk, Cantillon has weakened the beer. The focus comes to be strictly on the intense, cheek-collapsing acid and parching dryness. 
The sludge off of which this was decanted is much richer in raspberry aroma and a few drops of it into the glass yielded more body and a much more rounded lambic. But the brewer does suggest decanting.
Without the barnyard nose and earthy taste I've come to expect from Cantillon, this framboise is one-dimensional and, as a result, painful to drink. Among fruit lambics, Lindeman's pastuerized offerings are good at showing off pure fruit without the "wild" characteristics of lambic while Cantillon Kriek is a difficult but remarkable achievement of precisely what a fruit lambic ought to be. This one tries to walk the line, showcasing fruit but trying to maintain some historical integrity. Stripped of all its sugars, however, we don't seem to really be dealing with raspberries anymore and, stripped of funk, we aren't really dealing with Cantillon. 
Relax, relax.

Appearance: Ruby red pink tone with a light whitish pink head leaves some lacing scattered and fine.

Taste: Puckering even more so than most Cantillons I've tried, raspberry sweetness shows up somewhere in there funky edge yeasty note, I know this style is an artform but damn this one is wild. Spontaneous fermentation at it's best hits the palate with a barrage of sour notes but with each sip it grows on you. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied spritzy carbonation world class lambic.

4.7/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance:
2001 Vintage: 750ml brown glass bottle. Corked and crowned. The crown is pried off and the cork is removed. A lovely, exceptional looking reddish liquid emerges from the bottle and is topped off by a lovely off-white/pinkish head of foam. The foam lasts the entire glass and coats the sides, leaving exquisite patterns of Belgian lace.
Smell: The aromas are exceptional (always the case with Cantillon it seems) and consist of freshly picked raspberries, raspberry seeds, pits, flesh, skin, pulp, everything raspberry!, as well as belgian yeast, wheat, farmyard animals, horse blankets, old shoes, musty movie theatres, and old basements.
Taste: The taste is excellent. A lovely blend of lambic funk and fresh raspberries. The taste is a bit too tart (even for us hardcore lambic heads!) up front, but it than smooths out with some lovely raspberry essence in the middle and a lovely smooth, lingering fruity flavor in the finish. The funky hints are very prominent up front and in the middle, but suprisingly the finish is pure, whole raspberries!
Mouthfeel: This one is spritzy with some lovely carbonation going on. This is neither too thick, nor too thin, it resides in between the two in a town called "perfect".
Drinkability: Insane! Very tart and funky, but oh-so good and tasty. The fresh raspberry aromas and the lovely fruity flavors of this Cantillon offering are excellent. The lou pepe series is really quite different than many other Cantillon offerings, as this brew is much sweeter, and fruiter than the Rose De Gambrinus and similar brews from Mr. Van-Roy.
Overall: Expensive? Yes!, but oh-so worth it at least once. At $30 a bottle, this beer is quite pricy, and hard to find...but you should still really try to get some. As the fruit is the main attraction in this one, the fresher your bottle is, the better! Man, oh man do I hope that I can sample some of this fresh at the brewery next week! Please Jean-Pierre, put some aside for me! 1,987 charactersfrancisweizen, Mar 08, 2004

Pours a deep hazy red color. It is well carbonated and produces a pink head as I pour it into my glass, though the head disappears quickly. There is an immediate aroma of raspberry seeds (fruity and woody). A slight sour aroma is joined by a musty leather note, though raspberries certainly dominate the nose. There is a good raspberry presence in the taste as well. The raspberry fruitiness makes it seem like there is a hint of sweetness in this otherwise austerely dry Cantillon offering. As expected this is fairly sour, though not extreme. The beer has a tannic, woody aftertaste that coats the teeth and mouth like a tannic red wine. A bit musty, but overall the Brettanomyces character seems subdued.
This beer definitely expresses the raspberry character more than the Rose De Gambrinus, though this is still quite dry so that the fruit can be hard to pick up if you don't know what to look for. I really like how the acidity pairs with the fruit character. This is a very well integrated beer, no one element overpowers the other. 1,086 charactersGueuzedude, Mar 02, 2004

Poured a muddy reddish-brown with a ring of off-white with a hint of pink head around the edge of the glass. Smell has hints of vinegar, wet horse blanket, earthy barnyard smells. Taste is very tart, with a hint of raspberry. The sourness is very strong and overpowers the tongue, crosswiring "sour" with "salty". Hints of raspberries stay throughout the drink. Has a malted vinegar character to it, but every time you breathe in after swallowing, there is the raspberries all over again. The mouthfeel is very bubbly and stimulating, light and refreshing. This is one tasty beer, and my first "real" lambic - I'm hooked! 638 charactersjlervine, Feb 27, 2004

Poured a strange paled red color, showing a muddled hue through out the glass. Had no carbonation or anything else. 
Smell was a musty scent toned down, a sour that had mellowed, and a yeast presence that had almost completely receded. The berries used have begun to poke through though a little muted by that strong Cantillon lambic base, showing a rounder fruit smell than in other Cantillon beers, especially younger vintages.
Taste was extremely smooth, as the berries tasted so natural since their tart and seedy bite could come through, mainly because the lambic base had calmed down from aging. The noticeable sour flavor began strong but restrained and proceeded to recede beautifully toward the finish, creating a mellow tart flavor relative to their younger vintages. 
Most definitely complex, but I could recognize and enjoy the complexity as the aging has calmed this beer down, as opposed to younger Cantillons where the complexity and sheer punch is overpowering. Had this next to my father's Lindemans Framboise and the contrast was stunning, making the competition much too sweet and simple. 
A bit of a flat mouthfeel though more than easy enough to drink. A stellar framboise, I've never had one this good. 1,319 charactersnomad, Nov 05, 2003

There was definitely a nice dark raspberry hue to the beer, also to be expected. The fragrance definitely contained the expected yeasty aromas with the sweet/tartness of the raspberries, also VERY good things in my book! I have come to anticipate a certain character from Cantillion and I was definitely not let down. The taste was as wonderful as I had hoped. Nice yeastiness to it as well as a delicate raspberry taste. The only reason it did not do better in the drinkability is because I may only want one, but would savour it as I did have that one. I wish I did not see that this is listed as "limited edition"!! Enjoy!! 776 charactersgueuzegeek, Nov 03, 2003
