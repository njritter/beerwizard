Probably the oldest beer I've had (that I've been aware of anyway).
Tea brown in color with a slight fizziness.  The aroma is almost boundless and full of funky notes of over ripened peach, white grape and plum with a base of spent grain, and damp straw.  Tastes vinous with a nice mix of sweet and tart up front followed by more smooth, long tartness to finish.  Has a medium tartness all the way through while notes of grain and wheat mingle with a touch of white grape juice, peach pith, cherry, other fruit peel and faint wood.  Body is medium and goes down super dry.  
Never overbearing, but never boring either.  This one knows right where it needs to be, and for that reason it enjoys its place among the elites. 744 charactersstephens101, May 20, 2017

4.33/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a cloudy amber with a little sediment, almost no head, some lacing and rising bubbles present.
Smell is very mild and pleasant, of warm ripe cherries, maybe some green apple and a little pear, some funkiness.  I feel like I'm smelling a sweet fruity wine.
Taste is unexpectedly sour. When you get past that, you start noticing layers of fruit and funk and a nice little yeasty character, sour cherries and apple. Feel is medium bodied.  After swallowing, what lingers is some sourness that fades and you notice a slight sweetness behind it. You get used to the sourness as you drink and it starts to feel more balanced.
I'm not a big fan of sour but there is something strangely compelling about this beer. 712 charactersPlinyMeNow, May 06, 2017

Review is on both  a slightly heavy pour that didn't decant the beer as well as possible, with notes on a shared one that was
Pours a very clear amber brown until the bottle is tipped a little too far.  A properly decanted beer holds its off-white head a little better.  Visible but limited streams of tinny bubbles eventually can't hold the impression, and the beer ends up mostly devoid of head.
The nose is classic upon initial impression - which comes quite quickly after the cork releases with a loud pop.  There seems to be a fairly even balance of cherry tartness, red wine grape, and barrel woodiness.
The first sip hits me with more sour punch than I expected from the nose.  Once that is accounted for, the beer "mellows" a tad, though it is still decently sour - which does take this to the next level over the Flanders styles that came from the nose.  Despite limited exposure to my sight, the carbonation is definitely sensed via feel.  It accentuates (or is accentuated by) the sour notes from the added yeast strains.  This sourness has a cherry aspect to it, but overpower that flavor for the most part.  The wine tannins along with the former barrel's resident come out by mid taste, more notable than the cherries.  The cherries seem to make a little return in the lingering taste that otherwise has the yeast and barrel notes lingering.
The better decanted offering was a little more clean, but didn't seem to have too different a profile.  There was just a little more "funk" from the beer that had a little cloud of the dregs into it.
I slowly appreciated this more as I drank it, though I had it rated fairly high initially.  I really like the wine aspect of it, but wish the cherry was a little more evident on my palate.  Having had Dissident last week, I feel this one is a little more sour, doesn't showcase the cherry nearly as much, but has an better feel to it.  If the two weren't relatively difficult to obtain, I think it would be a fun side-by-side. 2,009 characterscjgiant, Apr 16, 2017

Pours beautiful out of the bottle - an amber hue with a thin head. Aroma is must, oak, overripe cherries and green apple. The taste follows right along in a cascade of sweet, sour, funky and woody. There's an impeccable dry crispness that zips to the back of my mouth and zaps my palate with a flanking attack. Wonderful feel, beautiful beer. 602 charactersManapuaMan, Apr 10, 2017

The smell and taste are of wine barrel and cherries. The sour cherries are on the forefront, with red wine and oak.  Slight musk on the nose and a lovely tartness on the palate. Grape must. Incredibly crafted beer. A nice mouthfeel, well carbonated and not overly tart, dry.
Any time you get a Russian River beer it's a great occasion and I'm very glad to have​ enjoyed this. 546 charactersJordonHoltzman, Mar 13, 2017

4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a nice white head that dissipates very quickly but leaves a nice ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself has a very nice wine look to it with it's nice medium brown amber that is clear. It's a really nice beer to look at and the texture has a nice slightly syrupy appearance. The look is pretty nice.
The smell and taste have similar notes but at different strengths that create different experiences. The smell is a bit more bitter with the brett notes and a light berry pinot noir note that creates a nice light balance between the two notes. The oak note is a bit light and the cherry adds a nice tartness, which unfortunately gets lost in the brett every once and a while. The taste has a stronger pinot noir note as well as the other notes except for the Brett, which is weaker. The Brett note is weak but shows up stronger in the end as well as a slight vinegar note.The wine notes along with the oak mix very well but the cherry tart seems to be even lighter.
The feel is pretty good. It has a nice medium body that has a nice heft to it with some nice tingling carbonation to it. The beer is pretty smooth.
Overall, this a very good beer and worth getting if you enjoy sours. It's a nice mixture of different notes that complement and contrast each other. If you can get it, go for it. 1,324 charactersHattedClassic, Feb 22, 2017

A:  Monstrous soapy foam head with a macro-bubbly topping, light tan coloring dominates the greater portion of the vessel with a leisure decline. Backlighting reveals a dark ice tea coloring with a bubbly sense of micro-carbonation. Lacing kept to a minimal. 
S: Huge funky barn scent, animal feed, hay and sour fruit, cherries and musty wood. Good scent. 
T: Smooth sour cherries, damp fruit and barn like funk. Feed grains, apple-plum esters like flavor. Light sour lemon fruit, cypress greenery, sour caramel and light herbal tea with a lightly acidic nature and acetic notes. 
M: Silky smooth, no carbonation, medium-full density. 
O: The flavor is very good, soothing sourness. Hard to go wrong with a Russian river, very eloquent, smooth, well blended complexity and transiition of flavor from start to finish. A bit $ at 16.50 per 12oz, but worth the experience one time. Barrel aged, and sure to impress.

This beer pours a hazy reddish brown color. When held directly up to the light it reminds me of juicy juice. There is a fizzy, one finger off white head that recedes quickly to a 1/4 inch ring around the edge of the glass and a microfilm layer across the top. No lacing to speak of.
Smell is red wine, sour cherries, apple cider vinegar, slight barnyard funk and oak.
Taste is the same. Just a touch of sweet at the start that is washed away by tart flavors. 7 out of 10 on the pucker scale. Very complex.
Feel is light, crisp and well carbonated.
Overall a fantastic beer. I'm not extremely well versed in sours, but I've had more than a few, and this is really incredible. The best of the best. 736 charactersCNoj012, Jan 29, 2017

The aroma is sweet with the oak and cherries the most noticeable to me but the oaky vanilla smells almost like caramel. The taste is pleasantly sour and sweet with the taste of wet oak, vanilla and cherries that are complimented by the bright, tart acidity of the wine. What a finely crafted and complex brew. 406 charactersFriedSlug, Jan 22, 2017

Palate Contaminants: other beer
Appearance is nearly red, but not quite. There's still a little amber. Chalk up a new color. It's clear, and there's not much head.
The smell is floral, funky, and cherry. It's also medicinal, which isn't quite what I'm looking for.
Fortunately, the taste exceeds the smell (and it's usually the other way around). The cherries are more prominent, but I'm getting a lot of cinnamon for some reason. Oh, well. I'll just enjoy it. Hibiscus tea, plums, and currants, too. There's even a bit of chicory in there. The brett settles way down, letting other star flavors headline.
The feel is plenty carbonated, and maybe a little thinner than I'd like. In the aftertaste, the hibiscus and cherries fade a little, letting the brett back in. 790 charactersZythophile, Dec 03, 2016

Smells amazingly of Brett, sour cherries, barnyard funk, Cantillon Brewery-like woody cellar, and oak.  It's all richly balanced and smooth on the nose.
Sour and perfect.  Taste follows the nose, but all these nuances are so subtly displayed, without any obtrusive features.  The smoothness of Pliny the Elder on the tongue, though a completely different beer altogether.  
Light feeling body, highly carbonated to almost more than expected.
Got at Russian River Brewing Company in Santa Rosa, CA a few weeks ago.  Drinking in New Hamburg, Ontario, October 10th, 2016.  Been looking forward to this beer for a long time, and it doesn't disappoint. 771 characterspatre_tim, Oct 10, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've been on a sour kick for the last year or so, and came across this beer at a local beer festival. I recognized the name, looked it up again online quick to confirm how highly rated it was, then went over and talked to the guy pouring. I couldn't believe they had a full keg of it, and the guy confirmed that it's pretty rare to see and there were no restrictions on how much I could drink. I sat by that keg for as long as possible, consumed at least ten beers worth since the guy picked up quickly and started pouring full glasses to save us both time and effort... and it was amazing. Easily the best beer fest experience of my life. This beer is the gold standard of sours, I couldn't imagine a better drinking experience. Sours are a genre of their own, so tread lightly if you haven't dabbled before... but if you are into the style, you can't get better than this IMO. 878 charactersphillyfan9, Oct 01, 2016

Pours a deep tangerine hazy orange with half finger egg white head. Dissipates to just a ring. No lacing. Looks like iced tea. 
Smells of funk, cherries, oak, grapes and apples. A lot going on in the aroma with all the funkiness. Definitely smells like sour cherries though. 
Taste of oak, sour cherries, apples, grapes from the Pinot Noir and some funk. Very balanced with all the flavors attacking. Very smooth. Taste like a sour alcoholic Shirley temple. Very nice. 
The mouth is sour funk, with a solid amount of carbonation. Juicy finish. 
I wasn't quite sure what to expect on this guy, but he was pretty good. Very well balanced. I'm not sure if I'd pay $16 for another bottle, but I would definetly drink this again with no hesitation. 789 charactersDrinkThemAll, Sep 29, 2016

With a POP of the cork, this beauty pours out a pale blonde forming into what I can only describe as Cranberry Cocktail, or Strawberry puree mixed with a dash of prune juice. The head is diminutive and fleeting, leaving only bubbles on the upper deck. Opacity is darn near full moon, but leaves enough room for light to ignite the sides of the body in this tulip.
Perfumey notes of crisp cut apple, potpourri, bartletts, and cider. 
Taste actually throws a huge curveball of vinegar first...quite different than what I was expecting. After a couple of seconds, this fades into some muted apples, dark berries, oak woodiness, and light fruit skins. Still, tannins and vinegar permeate the flavor profile profusely. It's almost as if fruit flies were to magically spew out from the glass. Very fermented. Ends with strong vinegar and wine notes. 
A bit dry and tart on the feel, feeling a touch parched here, yet it still finshes rather wet. 
Overall, SUPPLICATION was not the grand slam I thought it would be, but it could be due to the age (I was traded this bottle without prior knowledge of the age). I'd like to try this fresh, but definitely not at the $15-20 a bottle this normally goes for. 1,237 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Sep 10, 2016

S - biggest notes are first tart cherry then a must in essence that reminds me of my grandpa's basement in a good way. Then more tartness, funk, barnyard, hay in the background. Some brown ale caramel and bready notes are peeking through the sourness. The MAIN thing with this beer is its a complex sour ale. It gives you more than just the sour. 
T - same as the smell. Awesomness. See above. 
M - medium mouthfeel. Initially feels like it should be light but once you start drinking it the sour/funky parts of it separate the boys from the men. Alc covered. Aftertaste is sour cherry. 
O - RR sours are the best overall had. Maybe Cantillon is better but I wouldn't know. I've never had a domestic brewery that lived up to the home of Supplication and Sanctification. 895 charactersHopHunter19, Sep 06, 2016

A: With an earthy reddish brown color in my Teku, this beer has a quickly dissipating head. Inspecting through light, the color almost has a copper-blood hue. 
S: Heavy cherry and red wine character with a hint of cherry on the nose. 
T: Rich sour barrel flavor with dark cherry and lacto funk. If you let the beer sit on your tongue, its brown ale base is much more apparent with lots of creamy malt. This makes it sing. 
M: Lots of carbonation tartness with a decently creamy follow-through. 
O: I may enjoy Consecration a bit more, but this is probably a higher quality beer with more elements waiting to be explored. Regardless, this is fantastic stuff. 683 charactersRanz, Aug 29, 2016

This beer is really great, don't get me wrong, I just don't think it's worth me getting so excited about seeing it on a shelf. Happy to check this off the list though. Kind of a rotten aftertaste. Solid otherwise.
Sour Browns have seen better days, although from what I understand this beer has gone downhill a bit? That would make sense. Still great though and still worth the price even if it's no longer worth the hype. 459 charactersJack_Malts, Aug 19, 2016

4.76/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottled 5/11/2015. Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is a vibrant, slightly hazed, ruby-tinted brown coloring, with a thin film of off-white head on the surface, and a ton of carbonation flowing throughout the body. Aromas of  tart and sour cherries, dark and sweet pinot notes, earthy undertones, hints of currants and berries, and a solid sour component throughout. Flavors are very sour and tart cherry forward, with a solid acidity and richly sweet backbone. That backbone has notes of cherry, chocolate, currants, and toffee, but it is only an accent character, as the tart and sour blend sweeps it up very quickly. Along with the cherry, your taste buds are overrun with tannins, horseblanket, lemon juice, dry and rich pinot characteristics, wood spice and char, tobacco, and an overall sour tone. Very dynamic and layered palate. The body is dry and crisp, with the increased carbonation cleaning up alongside the astringent sourness. The aftertaste is mostly cherry and wood, but with some earthy notes still lingering here and there. The finish is bone dry, with the sour pucker and acidity wringing every last drop of moisture out of your taste buds, leaving them begging for more. What a tremendous beer! 1,235 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 08, 2016

Pours a hazy, dirty-cranberry red with a half-inch pink head that reduces to a continuous ring of tight bubbles.  Aromas of cherries, yeast, oak.  Taste is slightly sour cherries with oak, pinot grapes, and just a hint of fresh hay.  Mouth is dry and lively.  Overall, an exceptional sour beer, reminiscent of a fine wine. 407 charactersFFreak, Jun 13, 2016

Not sure if it was the addition of the cherries and their tartness. The finish was dry and earthy. Did I enjoy, Yes. From cold to warm it really didnt change much in taste. Drink time was about 45 minutes or so.

4.06/5  rDev -9.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Color of rooibos, that is, hues of amber red and brown working together, with some occasional bubbles and a thin ring of fizzy bubbles that dies to nothing. Supplication leaves wine-like legs on the glass, and even seems at times a bit hotter than the listed ABV would suggest.
Bright acidic cherries and light vinegar on the nose. A little blueberry even, as it warms. Woody and peppery notes really bloom and take center stage as it reaches room temp.
Cherry is nicely present without taking over. Too often, when cherry is on the label of a sour, it's either entirely absent, or it's overpowering. There is a nice balance in Supplication. A bitter and acetic sour element works well with the cherry, bringing much less a powerful vinegar-like presence than the nose hints at. A little supporting oak in the background.
A hefty tangy sting hits the tongue up front and tingles the back of the throat, but it goes down fairly dry. 934 charactersSabtos, May 24, 2016

A: Transluscent dark amber, 2 finger light tan head, poor retention, minimal lacing.
AR: Lactic funk, oak, wine, cherries.
T: Follows nose, lots of oak on the finish, slight astrigency.
M: Medium carbonation, slightly prickly, medium body.
I love this beer, but I much prefer it on draft. Oak and wine really come out in the bottle. Draft is a little more tart and fruit forward w/out so much astringency. 434 charactersyung_peli, May 20, 2016

Clear with a moderate off white foam head that hangs in pretty well for a sour. Aroma: Cherry is strong upfront, along with lactic acid, light toasted oak, and a distinct vinous note. Taste: Starts with a light sweetness with a touch of cherry, that quickly turns to a funky, earthy, puckering sour. Back end is distinctly vinous and acidic. Mouthfeel: Light body and moderate carbonation Finish: Very dry, with a lingering musty oak and cherry. Tart. Overall: A very unique sour in that the vinous quality of the Pinot noir barrel absolutely dominates the back end of this beer. This beer is puckeringly sour and tart, with a musty, funky quality. Leaves your mouth watering. 771 charactersTH28, May 07, 2016

4.73/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75L - pours a clear reddish copper, but this is so dark and crimson that it's actually opaque! Ominous bubbles linger on the bottom of the glass as the tightly backed, velvety head subsides. 
S - sour candy and rusted metal. A dark tart cherry with hints of raspberry and lime. Has an enticing, nostril-filling air about it that's hard to explain. Asserts itself with a strong and commanding present that is unrelenting. 
T - artfully crafted. Exerts a potent acidic tartness filled with flavors of cherry, Brett, and oak. An elegant vinous character creeps through toward the third act and finishes strong. This beer knows what it wants and will accept no compromise. Pink grapefruit abounds and coats the mouth with a waxy, oily residue that slowly imparts increasing sourness as time passes. The hops duke it out with the sour in the most civilized way, to the point where you're rooting for both, reflecting on the good points each is making in this debate. It finally hits you that they're not really fighting, but cooperating, and the tingling sensation absorbs into your gums and tongue... marinating. 
F - full-bodied and robust. Most sours are weak glass cannons, but this one has the backbone to stay strong! 
O - I think I like this more than Consecration. Beautiful menagerie of flavor. Both forceful and classy. This is the kind of man I wish to be when I grow up. 1,379 charactersagreenman19, Apr 24, 2016

Pours a beautiful ruby red, with a tiny off-white, bubbly head.  Very nice retention and great lacing along the sides of the glass.  Tart cherry, cranberry, and leather round out the aromas.  Ripe dark cherry upfront and throughout, mellowed with a touch of oak.  A lot of funkiness going on mixed in with wine characteristics from the pinot noir barrel.  Very acidic, with a perfect amount of carbonation, and nice and refreshing.  One of the better beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking.  World-class beer and a prime example of what other breweries should shoot for when brewing a wild ale. 669 charactersbrian44556, Apr 24, 2016

Taste is much like the aroma--lots of tart cherry and cranberry, but not overwhelmingly so. Nice notes of oak and leather. The acidity is certainly there, but well balanced with the sour flavors. Body is on the light side of medium with crisp, lively carbonation that seems perfectly suited to the rest of the beer.
Despite limited experience with wild ales and sours in general, I know delicious when I taste it. Very refreshing. Would love to have this paired with some proper food. 665 charactersglass_house, Apr 18, 2016

Aroma drops plenty of cherry, American oak, good tart and sweet thing going at the same time.
Taste is astringent oak, tart cherries, a gritty brett like contribution as they age.  Earthy, sweet and sour at the same time.  Alcohol extremely well hidden.  Whether on tap, in the bottle, vintaged out or fresh, this is always a world class beer. 518 charactersrodbeermunch, Apr 14, 2016

4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Bottled on 8-25-15. Received in a trade. Not too familiar with the style, so read this review with a first timer views on sours. I'm just writing what comes to mind.
Pour is a dark brown, maroon/dark red hue. Pretty considerable carbonation with loud, tight white bubbles. Moderate lacing.
Smell is initial leather and cranberries. Interesting new car smell. Getting cherries and red wine. A bit of funk. Band aids ? Smells like a hospital. (Once again, first time reviewing sours) Sweet oak and wood.
Taste is initial tart foward, but nothing overpowering. Getting some apple cider twang, subtle vinager, leathery funk, oak and wood. Some pretty heavy cranberry and cherries as it warms up.
Mouthfeel is very carbonated but not enough to take away anything. Medium bodied.
Overall this is the first fruited sour I've ever took time to analyze. Definitely opens to door for me to check out more. 900 charactersMateo2699, Apr 10, 2016

Dark, orange-brown body; very fine carbonation; thick, billowy, white head. Rather faint, malty aroma with that wild, brett-like quality; cherry and blackberry scent. Tart, sour cherry flavor; acidic. Very sharp, earthy bite; fine fizziness; tangy; dry.
Hmm. Overall, a fine, mouth-twisting tang and sourness to this beer. It comes across with a hard, biting crispness but with a decidedly soft and airy mouthfeel. The cherry twang is front and center, and the appearance is dynamite. I can't really say there is much brown ale maltiness left with this other than the color, yet the overall taste (considering its a wild ale) still is outstanding. Well, this is an awesome beer in all it's quirky, awesome glory... 752 charactersbeergoot, Mar 28, 2016

4.61/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This one pours a mostly clear dark red, with a small head, and not much in the way of lacing.
Smells like sour cherry, light leathery funk, some white wine, a bit of oak, and some lemony tartness.
This was the first sour I ever had, and I thought it was terrible. I didn't really understand sours. But now, having this again, a few years later, I can see how great it is. It's got a great sour macerated cherry flavor, a bit of oaky bitterness, some leathery funk, and a nice sharp acidity. The base brown ale is fairly present still, with some breadiness, and a little bit of sweetness. This is awesome.
This is medium bodied, with a juicy and tart mouthfeel, and a higher level of carbonation.
One of the best and most classic fruited sours out there. Near perfection. 774 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 10, 2016

Nose is bracing and extremely pleasant -- wine, vinegar, and cherry are all prominent. Palate follows, with tartness straddling the line between inadequately and overly sour for my tastes. Apple cider vinegar, sour cherry, but also some subtle but very useful sweetness/caramel. This beer is not one dimensionally sour and fruit forward like some of this style, and this dimension really makes the beer sing. Finish is long and delicious. 
So damn good. One of the best beers I've had in a long time. 643 charactersparkeak0, Feb 24, 2016

This was my first American Wild Ale I have ever tasted and pretty damn good.
Definitely could taste the cherries, pinot noir and oak - Since this was my first time trying this I expected this to be super sour and tart, but it was perfectly balanced and not overbearingly sour.  Definitely will have to get more of RR's beers! 340 charactersGregA135, Jan 19, 2016

Crisp taste, sour without being overpowering. The wine barrels have mellowed it, and imparted a smoothness you don't normally find..not harsh at all. Berries, a bit of rose wine.
Dances on the tongue. Light without being heavily carbonated 388 charactersTrojanRB, Jan 19, 2016

No hiding the use of pinot barrels or cherries in this one. Moderately strong barrel character, one of the oakier sours I've had and accurately reflects the time some of these blends spent in wood. Cherry taste is more earthy than sweet/tart. Very restrained sourness to the beer, can see why this is so popular as it serves as a great intro to the sour style. I like them a little more aggressive than this but it's easy to see how this beer has stood the test of time. 517 charactersVetsPackage, Jan 17, 2016

This was by far one of my favorites in the sampler. The couple of wild/sour beers in the sampler were spot on. Very distinct aroma, appearance, and flavor profile - it had that RR touch to it. Great medium body with a vinegar back end - just what I'm looking for in a sour beer. 384 charactersBiggtriksta, Jan 11, 2016

Pours a hazy red/purple, and you can smell the tart right out of the bottle. The wine barrel aging really rounds this beer out and gives it a great depth of flavor. Sour cherries and strawberry notes with just a bit of funk 342 charactersWillDavis707, Jan 03, 2016

Attractive amber-range pour with modest head. Some red hues in the light.
Big aroma of wine, grapes, cherries, and wild yeast.  A hint of spice.
Medium to full body,.
The taste is tart and sour but not overwhelming.  Decent toasted malts in the mix.  A peppery note.  This is a wild ale that I could drink often. 449 characterspuboflyons, Dec 28, 2015

Smell is cherries, oak, slightly acidic, brett funk and leather/band aidy phenols.
Flavor is strong tart cherry up front, some funk and oak on the back end. Finishes medium dry with some alcoholic sweetness.
Very thin and a bit fizzy. Disappointing in this regard.

Smell - Oaky to the max with cherries, malt, and yeast
Taste - Medium tartness/sourness with an oaky cherry taste that has a distinct dryness due to the Pinot Noir barrels.  Slightly funky.  The brown ale base beer gives this a mellowing dark malt presence and enhances the sour and fruit aspects of this beer.
Feel - Light mouthfeel, which combined with the light carbonation makes for a smooth sip (or gulp).
Overall - Not necessarily worthy of the hype it generates, but it is still an excellent wild ale at a price that doesn't stress my wallet... an easy buy for those who like sours and have access to this beer. 676 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Nov 26, 2015

Pours a gorgeous red color with little head. Aroma of cherry, oak, lactic acid, green apple, Pinot Noir... flavor follows the aroma with tart raspberry, cranberry, vanilla, citrus, slight lambic-like funk, Pinot, and tannins from both the  barrels and dried cherry skins ..complex, balanced and absolutely wonderful.  The feel is light and spot on for the style. Sparkling carbonation. Overall, a spectacular beer.

Pours  an amber/copper with small off white head. Aroma of green apple, oak, funk, slight wine barrel, slight malt.  Flavor follows the aroma with hints of cherry and a slightly different "twang than the other bottle reviewed that was 1 yr younger(fresh). The year of age has affected the color and flavor of this beer tremendously. I get much less of a red color, and much more funk and acetic notes than the fresh bottle. It is neither good nor bad comparing, just different. Very pleasing. More vinous. Carbonation is slightly higher but not tremendously. 1,048 charactersStolenface1, Nov 15, 2015

Not overly appealing aroma.  Taste is a sucker-punch of sour -- sharp, swift funk.  The pinot and cherries maybe slightly less apparent in the bottle from one year ago.  The sourness and funk from the brett really caught me off guard.  Tingly mouth feel.  This Russian River blows Pliny out of the water (but it's apples to oranges anyway, right?)  Fully lived up to all the hype.  Looking forward to trying some more of this at different vintages. 555 charactersanteatr23, Nov 01, 2015

4.93/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Obtained a 375ml bottle and poured into a snifter glass. The cork popped really loudly upon opening, releasing a nice aroma. The color is that of a cherry/amber with minimal head and lacing. The smell is of cherries and oak; somewhat funky. The taste is delicious and had lambic/gueze-like characteristics to it. It is a shame that this bottle is so small as I could drink a few of these in one sitting. Super delicious and worth seeking for in my opinion! Cheers! 464 characterstregan_20, Oct 30, 2015

4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 375ml bottled (11May15) into a tulip.
LOOK: Pours with a finger's worth of off-white foam that halves itself after one minute. Rising bubbles are small in size and high in quantity. Amber in color with a moderate amount of cloudiness. Lacing is high, thick, and remains on the glass.
SMELL: Has strong aromas of sour yeast and oak that combine with mild aromas of earthy yeast, red wine, leather, and hints of hay. The bottle says it has cherries added to it, but no cherry aromas can be detected.
TASTE: Initial taste is of very strong sour yeast and strong red wine flavors. Strong oak flavors immediately follow as red wine flavors fade to mild. As all flavors persist, subtle hay and hints of red cherries enter (there they are, barely).
FEEL: Medium-bodied and highly carbonated. Goes down rough and finishes with a surpsingly subtle dryness, given how sour it is. And yes, the sourness agressively plays with the tongue.
NOTE: This was an amazing American Wild Ale, but Atrial Rubicite still takes the top place. 1,032 charactersMyotus, Oct 05, 2015

The taste is tart at first, and then a sour dark fruit takes over that leads to a finish of oak goodness. You can really taste the age on this. The pinot wine is their and the barrel shines. I guess this is why this is a world class beer you can actually taste the care that was taken in this beer. 365 characters81tillinfinity, Oct 04, 2015

Nose brings on the pinot and cherries, but its mellow and complimentary to the brett and lacto. The flavor follows suit - funky and perfectly sour - incredibly well balanced, which I think comes from the oak aging on this one. Thrilled I had an opportunity to have this. It was awesome. 357 charactersAnalogErik, Sep 08, 2015

Pours orangey copper with pink glints.  The fizzy head lasts about 20 seconds before disappearing and not leaving much lace on the glass.  Gorgeous cherry and oak notes mingling with some funk in the nose.  Cherry, raspberry, lemon, irony oak notes, horse blanket, tropical fruit and bready malt.  The finish is super dry and fruity, lasting a good while.  The mouthfeel is full of carbonation, not as prickly as champagne but very active.
This is a fantastic Wild Ale.  Deservedly a benchmark of the style.  So complex and juicy, and it holds up to age fantastically.  A must try for anyone. 673 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Sep 03, 2015

I know there are plenty of fantastic sours out there and but the standard by which they are still measured are those from Russian River. 354 charactersbowzer4birdie, Sep 01, 2015

It looks ok so long as no yeast gets into the pour. Smell is typical, nothing over the normal. This beer however excels in taste and feel which is what really matters. This things rocks! It feels amazingly smooth and does not do what other sours do. 364 charactersiTunesUpdates, Sep 01, 2015

I loved it.  Perfect tartness and the perfect level of funk.  Great feel for a sour.  I opened it last night after my nephew scored me another bottle from the brewery (along with several others)!  Not sure if I should age it longer or not?
This was bottled in early January of 2015, so  it was almost 8 months old.  It sure hit the spot for me.  Hard to imagine it being better. 544 charactersHoppity1, Aug 29, 2015

A: Pours slightly hazy deep copper brown with an off white head that settles to a light layer and laces well. 
S: Tart, dark fruit, cherry,  some oak and wine character from the barrels, and a hint of alcohol. 
T: Quite tart, sour cherry, a faint almost raspberry like something in there, nice oak character and touch of wine from the barrels, a little funk, and the slightest bit of sweetness on the finish.
M: Medium body, moderate but prickly carbonation. 
O: Very well done, and properly sour. 527 charactersRyanK252, Aug 26, 2015

Pringly carbonation and mouthfeel.  The lactose carries over but it isn't ultra-vinegary.  You can definitely pick up the pinot noir flavors, but I couldn't find the Brett much on my pallete.  Lots of sour grape must, a little cherry and hibiscus as well. There is a pointed oak note on the end from the barrel aging, and it is a tad too bitter on the linger for me. Overall a great sour but not some mythological perfection. 530 charactersajm5108, Aug 23, 2015

A: Pours a reddish brown color with an off white head, some carbonation, hazy, some lacing.
A: Sour tart funkiness, cherries, picking up some oak, white grapes, smells really good.
T: Sourness, cherries, oak, white grapes, finishes funky with more oak and dry. 
M: Medium body mouthfeel, less carbonated than it looks.
O: My first sour I had about a year ago and did not like it, I think I had to explore the style first. This is really good, complex, I don't remember getting as much oak but it is well balanced with cherries and the other sour characteristics. 637 charactersBrolo75, Aug 22, 2015

4.17/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Spiegelau tulip. Bottled on 1/16/15 printed on label.
Appearance: Pours an opaque copper-orange with a 1/2 finger bubbly snow white head which dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing.
Smell: Oak barrel and cherries dominate with a touch of barnyard funk and vinegar. There is a hint of sweetness that balances out the sour aroma. Smells amazing.
Taste: The oak characteristic from the barrel is dominant up front with a blast of sour cherries and lacto sourness in the middle before ending with tannic dryness that leaves a very mildly sour and oaky finish. Overall, the flavor is a bit abrasive and not as balanced as I would have liked.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. 
Drinkability: Decent drinkability. This is a one and done beer for me.
Overall: Very good beer overall. The aroma is by far its best characteristic as it smells truly great. I would definitely recommend trying this beer, but I think it's a bit overrated. 989 charactersadam42381, Aug 18, 2015

Pours a hazy, darker amber with a mild head and some delicious cherry and sour funk notes emanating out. Goes down incredibly smooth and not too bitter at all on the back-end.

4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5pours an inviting amber-mahogany color. The most sophisticated description of smell that I could initially muster was: sour. After giving the beer a minute to breathe, though, it reveals fragrances of cherry and cranberry that then give way to scents of green apple and lime. Taking the first sip is an experience unto itself. While the nose gives you every indication that you should expect a Martinelli’s Sparkling Apple-Cranberry concoction, the sour profile puts your tongue in a chokehold. This aggressive taste eventually does mellow and reveal an oaky red wine flavor. Tannins are present and add to the tartness of the sour cherries. Overall, this beer is one of the pinnacle sours available today. And beyond all else, you have to love the fact that the carbonation bubbles – like the old man in Up – continue their journey through the very last sip.

Nose is funk forward, tinge of sour and vinegar with some bright over ripe fruit, definitely cherries on the top.
Flavor is exactly as expected except maybe even more sour than expected. Definitely a solid funk here and a really bright and bitter component along with the sour.  The oak adds a nice depth of character and the body feels more well rounded for it.  Really awesome sour here, a real treat. 486 charactersoldn00b, Aug 15, 2015

Summery: Hard  for me to give a true summary, not a big sour fan. its really good though compared to the other sours I have had. I have had 4 Russian River Sours. Temptation (chardonnay Barrels) has been by far my fav. This is totally complex and tasty. I cant give a far review when I don't love Brett. My bottum line as with most sours.They would be awesome if they were cheaper... I don't find the value in them. That said, this brew is unique and packed with complexity through and through~ 667 charactersClePaul, Aug 03, 2015

I was at RR last week and had Consecration, and I'll preface this review by saying I enjoyed that beer more. Supplication has a very nice bright nose that is fruit-forward, sour,and followed by some in ce brett funk. The taste loses most of the fruit and is extremely vinous. The finish is like licking the side of a wine barrel.  Very interesting, but a bit odd with such a disconnect between the nose and taste. I also found myself seaching for those cherries to no avail. Overall, a pretty good beer, but not as balanced as some other RR sours. 587 characterscaptaincoffee, Jul 27, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Maybe it’s because I just finished watching Somm for the thirteenth time or maybe it’s because I drank three Supplications tonight, but this Russian River creation has me a bit confused— is it a fine wine or a finer beer? Since we can’t pick up on scents like new rubber hose or fresh tennis ball canister, we’re assuming it’s a beer… and a damn good one at that. If you haven’t seen Somm then you have no idea what I’m talking about… 
Dispensing with the wit for a moment, I can’t help but stare at this beauty — in the words of Zoolander, she is “really really ridiculously good looking.” Supplication, of course, pours an inviting amber-mahogany color. The most sophisticated description of smell that I could initially muster was: sour. After giving the beer a minute to breathe, though, it reveals fragrances of cherry and cranberry that then give way to scents of green apple and lime. Taking the first sip is an experience unto itself. While the nose gives you every indication that you should expect a Martinelli’s Sparkling Apple-Cranberry concoction, the sour profile puts your tongue in a chokehold. This aggressive taste eventually does mellow and reveal an oaky red wine flavor. Tannins are present and add to the tartness of the sour cherries. Overall, this beer is one of the pinnacle sours available today. And beyond all else, you have to love the fact that the carbonation bubbles – like the old man in Up – continue their journey through the very last sip. 1,510 charactersljjpowers, Jul 19, 2015

S — Smells of richly bright and tart fruits, lots of tart bitter cherry character, as well as an oaky mellowness to it. There is certainly a predominant sour tone to this one, little bit of funky Brett as well, but not as noticeable.
T — Just great layers of flavor and depth. Great sour cherry notes, can definitely pick up on the lacto, and there is a bit of pedio sharpness as well. But really this is a great representation of the cherries and the barrel aging. Brett has really helped to clean this one up and meld everything together into a great harmony of flavors.
M — Light in body, very very dry, thank you Brett!
O — Just spectacular overall, tough to compare this to anything, just in a class of its own. 810 charactersMoose90, Jul 15, 2015

The aroma is of sourness, up front, but there’s a background maltiness, brown bread crust, fruitiness of a type, and the flavor is of tart cherry skins, semi-sweet malt, sour and sweet fruit, and essentially no bitterness. Even a nutty, woody, cherry seed. Also, barrel-aged wood. Mouthfeel is medium, and Russian River Supplication finishes semi-dry and exquisite.

4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Purchased two bottles in May '15 while visiting RRBC. Tasting first bottle (bottled 1/16/15). Chilled bottle first in fridge for 30 minutes. 
Appearance: Poured in tulip glass. Thin white head that dissipates quickly. Looks and pours  like rose wine. 
Smell: Smell of dark cherries, plum, oak, hint of vanilla or sugar. Slow carbonation bubbles from bottom of glass. 
Taste: Tart cherry, Residual taste of wine musk. 
Feel: Velvet texture. Mild booze, oak  dry finish with wine musk. Not as sour as expected 
Overall: Compared to lower end Gose beers, berliner weisses, and other sours, not as pugnant, rather smooth; taste complexity could be contributed to the oak aging?
I really like anything RRBC, but would like to compare to Sanctification, which I have a couple of bottles of as well. Thinking about what this would taste like before aging? Solid investment for instant enjoyment and aging. Strongly recommend for any avid sour ale drinker.
Review 4/10/2016:  bottled on 1/2015
Aroma is oakraisin cherries, vanilla or lavender notes. Awesome appearance with slight carbonation and thin balanced head. Darker cognac appearance looks slightly darker. 
Aged and cellared compliments the oak notes some less cherry than I remember 1,240 charactersjtwhicker, Jul 04, 2015

4.81/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle to a new Belgium globe glass.  
A golden color with pink-ish hue and a long lasting head that is also pink-ish. A lot of sediment settles to the bottom of the glass. 
First smell during the pour is overwhelming bananas. In the glass it's horse blanket, cherry, and a woody smell from the barrel.  
Taste is instant sour, that easily slides to a sweetness for a dry finish. There's a lot of wood in the middle. More than I can describe, but really great. Probably the best sour I've ever had. Medium bodied and dry, yet still leaves a bit of a syrupy coating on the tongue. 
Overall a fantastic beer. Try it if you have the opportunity. 646 characterssearsclone, Jun 25, 2015

Possibly my favorite sour ever. Very tart up front and the cherries really shine through. I'm not a big fan of Brett, but it's used perfectly here. Just the right amount of funk (not overpowering) to add to the cherry, pinot, sour from lacto and pedio, with just a hint of oak on the finish = amazing. 333 charactersRichKent, Jun 04, 2015

Bottled on 7/11/14. Poured out of a 12.68 oz bottle into one of my tulip glasses, this beer pours a clear, deep amber red color with lots of little streams of bubbles continuously rising tot eh beer's surface.  Has a head that is about a half inch thick when first poured that settles to a solid 14 to 1/3 inch thick with very excellent retention.  Best head retention I've seen on any beer in awhile.  Aromas of tart black cherry along with a nice yeasty barnyard like funk that gives way to an oaked sourness along with some tannins and a sweet diacetyl that is rounded out with a subtle but definitely noticeable malt presence.  Very complex aroma.  Tastewise the tart cherry intermingled with the slightly toasted bready, biscuit malt notes come out first followed by the funky sour notes and oak tannins. Slight vinegar and an almost salty note rounds this beer out.  Quite an excellent flavor profile.  Extremely complex, yet something that blends together so exquisitely.  Has a dry and sour aftertaste.  Has a slightly crisp, but mainly smooth and frothy, also somewhat creamy, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  A damn fine beer here.  One of the best I've had in awhile.  Excellent drinkability and I'd say a pretty accessible beer for this style.  A very enjoyable beer all around here! Worth a try for sure if you can get your hands on it!

4.29/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Got this on my second trade but have just been letting it sit trying to gather up the nerve to try it after being wrecked by the Sourness that is Consecration.
A - Vibrant amber color. With rocky white head and great lacing. This beer looks similar to a Dr. Pepper with some malt body.
S - The smell comes off with a fruit bouquet with mostly a tart black cherry smell that is  quite nice. After the initial fruit aromas it has complexity. There is a sour character, some oakiness, and some tannins and a wine character from the barrel. In addition to all that there is also a malt, grain, and a sweet diacetyl which really adds depth.
T - With the first sip you get rocked by all of the different flavors but like all of the best beers it is complex but you can dissect it. Initially the cherries, sweet malt, and oak hit the front and then develop quickly in the middle with the sour but still fruity character that is more vinous. On the finish the sour helps cleanse the ton of different flavors but there is enough residual sweet malt, cherry, and grape to keep it tasty. 
M - light mouth-feel with high carbonation. The low ABV makes this very easy to drink and the balance of sweet and tart is pleasant. 
Overall, a very tasty sour. The cherries really make this beer. I really enjoyed how the fruit flavors blend well with the wine and malt but in a light bodied ale. It isn't like a  Lindemans Kriek cherry flavor but more like a dark cherry that rounds out the flavor instead of being a more candy cherry flavor. The sour is a strong contributor being at different intensities throughout the entire taste but is always complimented by some other flavor. This is much better than Consecration because of the balance of cherry, wine, oak, malt, sweet, and sour without the sour really making you cringe or overrunning all the other flavors.

A: Amber/brown in color. Can't see through. Very little carbonation, silky in appearance on top.
S: First impression reminds me of a wine with a hint of sourness. Cherries, apples and funky sourness. Oaky hints.
T: Pinot, cherry. Little funk. Not too sour. Tart, vinegar like aftertaste. Very accessible sour.
M: Low carbonation, dry finish. 
O: One of the first sours I've tried that I really like. I'm not a sour person but this is such a well executed beer I can't help but enjoy it. 529 characterschrisjws, Apr 10, 2015

It has the awesome, tangy aroma you'd expect from the style, with sour apple notes and other subtle fruity notes, including cherry and plum.  Tartness and the fruit alike continue over into the taste, but there's more sweetness and blended smoothness than many other sours.  There's some carbonation and syrup in the mouthfeel, but it comes off lighter than many of its peers.  It's a great beer. 529 charactersthebeers, Apr 05, 2015

The wine cask element overwhelms, but it's very pleasant.
Again, the wine cask element overwhelms, but it's a very pleasant sour ale. Tart cherry is the key element.
Medium to light body, ample carbonation with a somewhat dry finish.

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5L: Pours crystal clear auburn with a silky and luscious billowy white head that settles to around 1/2 inch and stays. Carbonation is light-to-medium and has a champagne like effervescence. One of the most amazing looking beers I've seen. 
S: Sour and tart cherry-funk first, with a sour apple and light pear aroma following, not overwhelming but very enticing and inviting.
T: Follows through on the nose, although the cherry flavors are understated, as are the oaky sour apple/pear funk. What struck most was the silky, creaminess of the cherry flavors, which don't hit at the front of the tongue like everything else, but at the back. 
F: Unbelievably creamy, full, rich and smooth. The cherry flavors coat like whipped cream and balance out the oak and funk. 7.75% abv and I taste about 0.5% of it. 
Overall: Beautiful to look at, inviting aroma, complex flavors that unfold slowly but never fight for their place as they move across the palate. All while remaining smooth and silky. Did Russian River invent American Wild Ale? Not sure, but they definitely defined it. 1,076 charactersmig100, Feb 16, 2015

Pours an amber-orange color, with a foamy, fizzy head, which reveals fiery spots in the glass, when faded.
The aromas reveal cherry stone pits among dried cherries, vanilla, warm, old wood and a zippy funkiness. Due to the present tartness, the cherries get a vinous, fermented note, gracefully balanced by the wooden, leathery malts, which lets their sweeter side stand out even more. Cherries evoke a pungent, rich impression of sunbathed, ripe fruits during a warm summer, with just a hint of invigorating lemon zest to them.
Has an unusual sweet taste for a sour beer, based on its malt and ripe fruit foundation, accompanied by matured, wine soaked chunks of wood, topped with a hint of vanilla. Lactic sourness rises from the fruitiness, giving the cherries a powerful, pleasant character, hovering above musty malts and oak. Acidity then blends outstandingly well into the cherry flavor, adding a vinous note to it without becoming too sour, accentuating the rich fruitiness, balanced by the earth and leather. The beer finishes pleasantly dry nontheless, supported by a vivid carbonation, with cherryskin, toasty stone fruit pits, a vinous tang and tooth quenching sourness, still leaving enough space for rejuvenating cherry qualities. 1,282 charactersaleigator, Feb 12, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a flute glass
Appearance is crystal clear auburn in color. An easy pour results is about a half inch head that settles to about an eighth, and it sticks around awhile. A nice aggressive swirl in the flute shows off a great lace, it looks silky.  Carbonation is light but steady, the flute really shows off the look.
The flute also focuses the musty red-wine and unmistakingly oaky- wood scent.  I cannot get enough of this scent, I'm picking up sour cherry, but it's more like being in a winery with the smell of wine making all around me in a dank cave.
Taste is a nice funky cherry up front with a strong wooden, and pleasant aftertaste that lingers until your next sip.  The red wine is very present and I wouldn't fault anyone that felt this was more wine than beer.   The carbonation is spot-on perfect and lifts these lively flavors over the palette.
This is as-good as discussed by my piers here.  Absolute home run for delivering the flavor it advertises and with clarity and mouthfeel being spot-on a top sour that you must try. 1,053 charactersBonsall_Phil, Jan 31, 2015

Smell – Sour cherry, vinegar, oak, and pinot.  It’s a really nice smell.
Taste – The first thing I notice is that it’s not overly sour (I’m not a fan of super sour beer).  Tastes of pinot, vinegar, and oak.  A really good sour!
Mouthfeel – Good carbonation, dry, not too sour, with a pleasant funky aftertaste.
Drinkability – I’m generally not a huge fan of sours, but this is an exceptional one to me. 539 charactersFalcon91Wolvrn03, Jan 23, 2015

Sharp acidity hits first bam! then an incredible sourness hits the back of the throat BAM. Second sip is better as the mouth adjusts, subtly cherry comes out, sour cherry, white grapes? Lots of funk. 403 charactersKATCanada, Jan 18, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I would have never thought in a thousand years when I began reviewing beers that my first perfect score would be a wild ale. I honestly hated the first few I tried. I have tried to think of any reason to knock this one down a notch but honestly I can't find anything wrong with it!
Appearance: Gorgeous copper red with some brown notes, a little hazy and a beautiful creamy head that just lies there throughout the drinking of this gem.
Aroma: Soft tart cherries, some brett notes, some earthy notes and a slight grape note from no doubt the Pinot barrels, but not overly potent, very nuanced this one. The layering of the aromas is truly magnificent. 
Taste: First you get some mild tart notes, but not really sour, just balanced. The Pinot Noir is definitely detected in the flavors, oakey vinous notes dominate, a slight farmhouse note but very subtle, not one that hits you in a dominant way. This beer has a nice clean carbonation on the tongue but it is also very creamy to the mouthfeel. I really don't know how they do it!
Overall: As I said before this is a perfect beer in every way. I am truly surprised. I want more and hope I can obtain many more, I have to be able to share this one with friends, its too good to have all to myself! Thanks man for the trade, truly incredible experience! 1,305 charactershumuloner22, Jan 17, 2015

The sour cherries are right there, melded seamlessly with the base brown, which proves a suitable foundation for the fruit and bacteria party going on. It's just a bit more drinkable and savorable than Consecration, which is sometimes just a bit too beastly for my palate. Fine stuff from RR, but would you really expect any less? 469 charactersbreadwinner, Dec 31, 2014

Aroma - some oak, funk, red wine
Taste - cherry, sour apple, oak. but some sweetness on the finish.  I like how the sour doesn't linger
Feel - lighter body, lower carb, dry finish 
O - A great sour; Im not the biggest sour fan but I enjoyed this.  Wasn't too puckering 389 charactersmaxcoinage, Dec 06, 2014

S - Sour apple jolly ranchers, cherries, oaky, yeast, pinot.
T - Tart cherries, pinot noir, oaky, some malts, layers of unique and different flavors.  Sour puckers on the back of your palate, but balanced by a semi sweet and oak flavors in the back end.  
O - One of the most unique brews I've ever experienced.  I'm glad I did, as this style is not in my wheel house. If you ever get a chance to get your hands on this, it is def worth a try. 622 charactersandrewjraab, Nov 22, 2014

A - Pours a deep burnt orange.  Translucent with lots of bubbles.  It's a light, coppery head that's fizzing away rather quickly.  Sharp looking.
N - Yeah, tons of barnyard funk with some sweet, sweet fruits around the edges.  You can tell the tartness is lurking somewhere just beneath the surface waiting to pounce on your taste buds.
T - Wow, amazing amounts of tart cherry and more barnyard funk.  A slight bitterness rounds out the flavor profile.  You get that sense of foundation that all great sours seem to have.
M - It's all froth in the mouth; the liquid froth-ifies the second it hits your tongue.  The tartness and combination leave a somewhat dry finish on the tongue, but the residue is everywhere else on the inside of your cheeks and the palate.
O - A real winner.  Hope I can get back to Philly for another bottle soon. 989 charactersCraftFan5, Nov 18, 2014

There is only the faintest of sour scents coming from it, the taste is a cross between an old bottle of Newcastle with hints of watered down jolly rancher.
I have had Belgian sours, I have had Cantillon, this is nothing more than a poor imitation. 410 characterswsay, Nov 07, 2014

Supplication has a *very* light mouthfeel for the depth, with incredibly crisp, delightful, complex, softly thick sourness imparted by its mix of adjuncts and agents.  A clear, mahogany-gold color, with reddish-brown strains clearly reflecting the pinot barrel-aging; a sour, cherry-inflected, very refreshing aroma; a pleasantly sticky, slightly sweets-laden mouthfeel all coordinate to create a really intricate, delicious, chimerical quaff.
Unsurprisingly, a really well-executed effort by Russian River, and just the sort of sour even those who aren't sour fans would love.  Meanwhile, as an inveterate sour fan, I would've loved to consume a lot more than the (approximately) six-ounce servings poured at Toronado's bar. 789 charactersOrestesMethuon, Oct 22, 2014

4.53/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Dark peach/amber colored red ale, topped with a surprisingly strong head (for the style) of light cream color. Retention is impressive. Lacing is nice. Hazy, nearly opaque brew with lighter edges.
Aroma of funk, cherries, oak, apples, tannins, and a wine-like sourness. Sour and tart funk are dominant, but there's a soft sweetness, as well.
Strongly sour up front, but tempered by fruit and malt. Sour cherries and cherry pits; Brett funk; red wine and vinegar; vanilla and oak. Very well balanced and complex, delicate brew. Especially fruity on the finish.
Very lively with no sting, a bit of foaming, and a medium amount of puckering. Silky smooth, with a wet finish that coats and sours your mouth.
Another excellent sour by Russian River, Supplication easily stands out as among the best the US has to offer in the style. 831 charactersRoguer, Oct 19, 2014

A = A deep orange with some brownish tints to it.  Very clear.  Minimal head on this pour.
S = We really had a hard time picking out any special scents.  Just well balanced.
T = Cherries.  Tart.  That was our big takeaway from this one.
M = SMOOTH
O = A great beer, but not my favorite style of beer.  That is on me and not Russian River though. 381 charactersjman42, Oct 17, 2014

Smell has a sour acidic aroma has a very faint malt backbone. Sour cherries and oak dominate the midsection and finish in the nose.
There is a big acidic sour flavor first to hit the palate and has some sweet grainy malt backing it up. Oak dryness and some red wine come in near the midsection and more tart acidity and oak in the finish. 
Mouthfeel has nicely contrasting dry, sticky sour, and crisp characteristics to it. Moderate to high carbonation 530 charactersFcolle2, Oct 11, 2014

S: Bracing sourness, sweet cherry, hints of funk. Direct, bold, and precise.
T: Great puckering sourness, although I would be fine with a little more. Cherry is predominant, but I get some darker fruit laced throughout, surely a result of the pinot noir barreling. There is faint but noticeable yeast funk that might add some tartness, but also gives it an earthiness that grounds it a bit.
M: Light, not smooth but no abrasive carbonation either. It does leave a bit of a gritty feel on my tongue and teeth, but only slightly.
O: Simply put, this beer is incredible. Assertive sourness with straightforward yet nuanced flavors. Care, craftsmanship, intelligence, and quality has gone into this, and the result is one of the best beers in any category. I can't say enough good things about it. 857 characters1000lbgrizzly, Sep 28, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.1%Nose: sour, cherries, suggestion of wine, faint malt. 
Pours: brilliant garnet tinted amber – almost a brandy color, under a stiff finely bubbled off-white foam cap with a faint pink tint. 
Palate: Cherry, lemon, light funk, tart. The cherries are excellently done and are well balanced by the tartness and the rich malt flavors cavorting in the background. As the beer warms slightly more elegance emerges as the pinot noir flavors emerge and mingle with the malt. Long lingering tart cherry flavors dominate the aftertaste. 
Medium body and medium to above on the carbonation. 580 characterspat61, Sep 24, 2014

4.15/5  rDev -7.8%Bottle dated 4/11/13,  poured into a snifter. My first Russian River sour.
A - Reddish amber, effervescent with scores of bubbles coating the glass and a slight bubbly halo. Hazy glacine.
S - Crisp sour apple and some sharp blue cheese. Accents of lemon juice. Smell is on the musty end, like damp laundry. Woodiness.
T - Cidery tart and a bit sugary. There's a mealy fullness in the middle, more malty then I'd expect. Grass, black cherries, green grapes, unripe raspberries. A dry burnt wood finish. Significantly smoother than most wild ales I've had.
M - Oddly heavy; a sort of medium weight with the fizziness of a sour.
O - Enjoyable, charming, but not revelatory. Still, It's piqued my interest for RR's other wine barrel ales. 739 charactersTheCuriograph, Sep 17, 2014

4.53/5  rDev +0.7%A: 4.25 Pours a cloudy, reddish-brown with about a two-inch light tan head. It looks a bit like a Flanders red.
S: 4.75 Lots of funk and vinegar right up front. Cherries come in right behind bringing a really nice, yet subtle, medicinal aroma that I’ve come to love in my fruited sours. There’s also some oaky, vanilla characteristics, adding some sweet aromas that balance out the funk and sour.
T: 4.5 Actually a bit sweet at first with the oak and vanilla from the nose. The sweetness is quickly met with a big dose of sour lemons, cherries, and funk. The cherries and their light medicinal flavor linger on the aftertaste. 
M: 4.5 The body is rather heavy for the style and coats the palate quite a bit. Fortunately, there’s plenty of carbonation to help the beer feel lighter as well as provide a nice, dry finish.
O: 4.5 This beer is an excellent example of what fruited sours can be. It carefully walks the line between funk, sour, fruit, and sweet with no single element dominating. While super drinkable, there are enough of interesting flavors and aromas to keep things lively. 1,098 charactersTele, Sep 08, 2014

A-Pours a deep clear orange-amber with creamy bone-colored head and leaves some lacing. 
S-Aroma is mostly funk, cherry, bretty, and little tart. When it gets warmer there are malty and wood aromas. 
T-Flavor has an excellent very tart and fruity flaovr. Rather subtle effects from the pinot noir barrel aging, especially in terms of woodiness. Excellent lingering, midly tart aftertaste. 
M-Mouthfeel gives a smooth, medium-light body with a good low carbonation. Finishes with near puckering tartness. 
O-Overall a great beer had to get back in the long line to get another. 620 charactersreebtaerG, Aug 03, 2014

A: Pours a dark copper with a heavy red tint and a little less than a finger of head that reduces quickly and leaves no collar or lacing. 
S: I get the funk and cherries up front, with the Pinot noir in the background complimenting very nicely. Smells crisp and refreshing. 
T: The cherries take the lead role, with a strong presence of the wine barrel just behind. The sour comes into play more on the back end. 
M: High level of carb, as expected. The sourness leaves a pleasant dry finish. 
O: Excellent sour ale from Russian River. The flavor and aroma come together extremely well. 684 charactersroger617, Jul 19, 2014

Full Belgian Tulip 
A: Dark amber body with some pinkish orange and brown tint on it. Very hazed look to it. Half finger of egg shell cream runs across the top with fair retention efforts and some light dotting of lacework running down the glass.
S: The nose is vinous with some sour cherry tartness, light vinegar, and a touch of acetone. I get lots of musky old grape skin in this one with some mineral like qualities to it. Smells nicely sweet and sour. 
T: Flavors are choke cherry with some cider vinegar, sour red grape, and light acetone. Slightly funky with a healthy pucker from some citric acidity. Further there lies some dark bready malt with a lemony lacto tartness and a dash of green hop bitterness in the background. Closes with a kick of alcohol spice, woody tannin, and a dry tart finish. Great balance and loads of complexity.
M: Moderately filling with a good tart pucker to the palate. Fairly clean and balanced with some light alcohol warmth. Finishes dry and tart. 
D: Exemplary to the style with layers of great flavor going on and a very controlled amount of funkiness. RRBC has such great balance in their brews while still delivering brilliant flavors. I found the Consecration to be a bit bolder but I can see Supp as much easier to drink and therefore held in higher regard. Surely recommended for those looking for a great Wild. 1,435 charactersNugganooch, Jul 17, 2014

A: translucent reddish golden brown with almost no head.
S: heavy smell of tart cherries with a faint wine aroma.
T: great cherry sour flavor, ends with the pinot noir aftertaste. Very similar to the aroma.
M: Very light, but in a good way. The feel is sour at first, but the finish is very smooth and the sourness fades quickly.

aroma is amazing. Oak barrel funk. Wet hay. Damp barn.
taste follows with wet funk and oak. Sour punch in the face then is dissappears. 
Such a solid beer. The barrel aging puts this on another level.
mouthfeel is crisp and we'll carbonated but not too much. 
Really refreshing. 
I need more of this. 355 characterszookerman182, Jul 15, 2014

 First off this brew looks beautiful. As you pour it's a bruin brown but shines and turns into a dark ruby red with a crystal white head - such an illusion. This is like a wine with head .
 Aromas are of barrel flavors and funky bacterias. Pure wild ale bliss! 
 Tastes like dark colored grapes with other fruits.
So tasty. Layers of barrel red wine flavors. Ripened cherries that have almost reached fermentation. That funky flavor of cherries locked up in a ziploc found a day after a long hike - such a unique flavor here 
 Mouthfeel is crisp but not too fizzy - sooo good when cold. A taste of decadence but never making one make a Face of discomfort - perfection 
Overall this is probably the best beer I've ever had regardless of style - it's so inviting and just full of all the favorite flavors I like in wine. A freaken winner and I would buy this EVERYTIME I see it 1,028 charactersModernrickk, Jul 14, 2014

Tart cherries, Pinot noir wine and oak notes in the nose. Big tart cherry flavor supported by wine like qualities cloaked in oaky notes in the background. Tartness is cut toward the end by the malt backbone, making it sour and funky but reeling it in before it gets too far out of line. Puckering and tart with vibrant carbonation and a bone dry finish. A sipper for sure and a fantastically different beer. 518 charactersHopBomb515, Jul 09, 2014

A: deep orange-amber; clear; Large creamy bone-colored head is fairly furable and leaves some lacing. 
Aroma: about as good as this style gets (for me). 
Flavor: excellent very tart and fruity flaovr. Rather subtle effects from the pinot noir barrel aging, especially in terms of woodiness. Excellent lingering, midly tart aftertaste. 
FeeL; smooth; medium-light body; good low carbonation; near puckering tartness.

A: Pours a finger of very thin bone colored head with a reddish brown body. What there was in head quickly fizzes away to a cap and ring. Nice sudsy lacing which slides down the glass quickly.
S: Fantastic nose. The first thing I noticed was tart cherries leading into a nice wine soaked oak. Transfers to a musty, dirty hay funk in the middle and some pleasant cheesy tang in the finish. 
T: Tart, juicy cherries and acidic stomach acid up front leading into some excellent wine barrel and musky B.O. Finishes with a nice lactic sourness and some nice chocolate malts to bring you down.
Mf: Prickly carbonation with a medium feel. Sharp and drying. Sip sip sip.
Overall: An outstanding AWA from Russian River. Nice juicy almost Kriek like cherries, and acetic short sharp shock with lost of remaining wine from the barrels in the middle. The musky jock strap Brett on the way down and the lactic acid tang complete the package. Really an outstanding sour ale from Russian River. 1,069 charactersCowsandBeer, Jul 03, 2014

A- Amber hue. Light white head retains at a ring. Semi-hazy.
S- A little tartness is detectable by the nose. Cherry, and maybe a little peach.
T- Sweet and tart, peach and cherry. A bit of tang, but not so strong. Malt is detectable, a bit of a bready character, in the background.
M- Zippy carbonation. Finish is semi-dry, just a little sweet. Body fairly light.
O- This seems to be Consecration's little brother. A little lighter, a little lower ABV, a little less tangy. But a very great beer. 555 charactersBWED, Jul 02, 2014

4.61/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours pretty dark brown, aggressive pour gives about 1 finger of head that is reduced to a film in under a minute but maintains around edges of glass. Smell is tart cherry, and some woodiness. Taste is sour cherry, cranberry, some grassy funk, definite barrel notes. As it warms some bready malts appear. Pretty full bodied in my opinion, tons of carbonation, maybe too much for me, sourness really sticks around for a while on the palate. Overall one of my favorite sours, glad I got my hands on some recently so I could put up a review on this great beer from RR. 565 charactersslackattack, Jun 27, 2014

A: A brown, fizzy brew with a thick, quickly dissipating head. Lacing is present with thin ring retained on the wall of the glass 
S: Sour funk, cherries and wine on the nose.
T: Sour Lemon, cherries, malt, sourdough funkiness, and dry wine on the palate. Very compelling flavors.
M: Thick feel, heavy carbonation, dry finish.
O: Another home run by Russian River, best sour I've had thus far. This beer drinks like a Pinot noir, lambic and sour brown ale simulataneously. 504 charactersAntnego, Jun 20, 2014

A: Pours a really nice, deep ruby-mahogany color with zero head whatsoever.
S: Black cherry Warhead candy, dry red wine, vinegar tartness, some funk.
T: Tart, oak-y Pinot flavor immediately, some cherry tartness follows. Dark, dry fruit, some funk in the finish.
M: Dry with light carbonation. Sourness is very pronounced, making this a sipper for sure.
O: Very, very solid,and truly unique. I prefer Consecration over this one, but would never turn it down... definitely one of a kind. 540 charactersHalfbrother83, Jun 18, 2014

4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I was walking through SF and came upon a small corner bottle-shop. I went inside and, WTF?!? It was like a beer mecca (there's irony here people); where things I'd only heard about were just sitting on the shelf waiting for someone to purchase. Why, there's a Black Albert, sure, I'll take one. Oh, a Supplication? I would love one...
Have I mentioned that I like sours?
No, well... 
I don't know how to put into words the level of love that I have for this beer. It's perfectly balanced, it's got amazing depth, the barrel, the cherries, oh my... 
Right, tell you why I like the beer: it's simply one of the best examples of a barrel aged sour beer that exists. The flavor is slightly fruity, puckery, and has these amazing layers that just keep coming. It's one of the best beers that I ever had. I disconnected my analytical beer drinking side, sat, and sipped thinking, "oh god" over and over. Not many beers allow me to do that. 937 characterstimfc, Jun 16, 2014

Tighter flavor profile than other sours - compare against Lost Abbey's Red Poppy and you're know what I mean.
Smell whiffs away stunningly, with a depth of taste and crispness. Strongly recommended on tap, which is rare but another level of effervesce and taste. 293 charactersBenempt, Jun 10, 2014

Very nice sour beer, with lots of brett agents.
Pours a dark beer with a reddish tint. Little bit of bubbles. Smell is glorious, typical sour. Taste is very good. I thought that I couldn't drink this by myself, but I totally can. It is not overly sour that makes your stomach burn. It is well balanced. Some traces of grapes. 332 charactersJulioH, Jun 08, 2014

Russian River beers are top of the line. 308 charactersKruxx, Jun 02, 2014

Pours a hazy dark amber. The 1/2 inch eggshell head fades to a thin film and a ring on top that leaves curtains of lace. 
The smell is of faint barnyard funk, biscuit bread, unripe cherries and a hint of vinegar. 
The taste is of sour cherry, white grapes and faint vinegar tartness.
The texture is light bodied with high carbonation. A steady stream of tiny bubbles rise up throughout the drink down. 
This is among the best sours I've encountered. Not overwhelming tart. Delicious cherry and Pinot noir accents. 539 charactersFurlinator, Jun 01, 2014
4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured a rich, semi-cloudy orange-brown, with two and a half fingers of fluffy white head that receded very slowly. No lacing. A very nice looking sour. Scents of sour brett yeast, oak, sour cherries, tart wild yeast funk, hints of lemon juice and a bit of overripe stone fruit in the background. A very nice aroma, rich, funky, wild and complex with a nice fruity character present as well. Flavor begins very sour, with notes of sour cherry and hints of cranberry and red wine. This moves into further sour flavors of cranberry, raspberry and cherry with notes of oak and red wine-like tannins. Finish continues to be quite tart and dry, with more abundant oak flavors, sour cranberry, raspberry and cherry and some sour, tannin-like astringency. Aftertaste is sour and dry with notes of cranberry, sour cherry and raspberry, alongside some oak. A very well done flavor profile. Dry and puckering, quite sour, but after the manner of sour red fruit and not vinegar or citrus. It has a depth and complexity to it, with fruitiness and oak helping to keep things balanced beneath the sourness. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium-high carbonation and a puckering, drying feel. Extremely nice, refreshing, yet also encouraging you to sip. The mouthfeel compliments the flavor profile nicely. Overall this is an excellent sour. It has a wonderful wild, sour, slightly fruity aroma, an excellent sour, fruity and complex flavor profile and mouthfeel that aids both the flavor of the beer and the drinking experience. Very well executed and quite a treat. Bottled on April 11th, 2013 and consumed on May 31, 2014. 1,622 charactersAuraan, Jun 01, 2014

A: Pours a beautiful crisp clear mahogany almost amber or copper color. Small head formed at first after pouring but quickly dissipated. Carbonation is medium to high.
S: Smells very lactic and tart. Dark fruits and great oak character. Very earthy and nice subtle hints of vanilla and good yeast spice. Aroma is very fruity and sweet but interesting for sure. 
T: Nice tart bite and good oak character right up front. Dark fruits and almost vinous character make for a very interesting brew. Not as tart as I was hoping but this bottle is young and would love to see how it ages. Nice dryness and almost tannin finish makes for a refreshing brew as well. 
M: Dry and fruity with good oak character and tannins lingering between sips. 
O: A great beer for sure but my expectations where a little high and was slightly let down. Don't get me wrong, its an amazing brew and definitely a must have by RR but maybe I'll give it another shot with some age. 986 charactersMarioM, May 30, 2014

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a tawny brown with a fizzy, loosely structured head that dissipates pretty quickly. Lots of sediment floaties.
Smell is sharp, funky and acidic, with barnyard and vinous notes.
Taste is sharp and assertively tart at first, sour on the back end. Mellows out after a few minutes and notes of grape, cherries, green apple and lime come through. It remains very tart, but in a more mellow, refreshing way. A truly unique beverage that makes you totally forget you're actually drinking a beer. Let alone a somewhat strong beer -- there is no alcohol flavor to be found.
Mouthfeel is prickly from the tartness, not so much from the carbonation, which is fairly minimal. Yet it manages to also be soft and velvety and coats the palate nicely.
This beer brings together traits from so many delicious beverages -- tart sparkling cider, champagne, red wine -- and marries them with a beer base to great effect. Not quite a luxurious as the Bruery's Oude Tart, but somehow more unique and refreshing. 999 charactersMongrel, Apr 28, 2014

A: Big, bright pit fruit, cherry and peach. Sweet sugary notes from the caramel malt and tart sourness noticeable as well. There is a definite oaky, wine character to the back, very fruity.
T/M: A good pop of sourness at the front, enhanced by moderate carbonation. Moves into sweet cherry and peach blended with brown sugar and vanilla notes. The finish is dry with lingering sourness and fruity flavors, a pilsner malt character moves in as well.
Overall, pretty much the best sour beer I have had. The appearance is nothing to behold, but the balance in aroma, flavor and mouthfeel is something to behold. While many sours may pound you with severe dryness, achieving great flavor but with severe detriment to your palate over the course of consumption, this ale strikes a perfect balance, never going to far either way. It utilizes a myriad of flavors from many parts of the process and creates one hell of a flavorful beer. This beer absolutely lives up to the hype. 1,080 charactersSiriusfisherman, Apr 10, 2014

Pours a hazy topaz brown with a micro thin head and lacing from the very fine carbonation. I am getting a foundation of grape and cherry on the nose with some lemony sourness. There is some faint sweetness on the nose which carries over to the taste. The grape was surprisingly dominant on the taste for me and I felt like the tart and dry pinot wine backbone held on to the finish. The cherry is also vivid but integrated in a pleasant way like in a good kriek lambic. There is a fullness of flavor - perhaps umami - but the beer remains very approachable and refreshing. The lemony pop also reminds me of good lambic, but the strong grape presence and the very dry and oaky finish does not. There is some presence of alcohol on the finish. There is also a good amount of earthy brett funk throughout as well. This beer is fairly sour. The barrel presence is actually quite strong and I think I would prefer a little less of it. The prickly and effervescent carbonation creates a creamy, light mouthfeel that works really well with the flavors and sourness.
This is an amazing beer, no doubt about it. There are a number of flavors that intertwine and last forever, helped along by perfect carbonation. This is a beer that goes down easy yet it has so much going on. My only complaint is that it has a little too much pinot grape influence for my taste. I wish the cherries had shown through more than the grape did. Nevertheless, I still love this beer and highly recommend it. 1,509 charactersbrianmandell, Mar 19, 2014

Great look upon first pour - a dark amber/red. I am a newbie when it comes to wild ales aged with sour cherries in pinot noir bottles. However, this is the second time I have drank this beer and it is pretty damn good. Especially becuase I prefer IPA's and Stouts. Aroma is sour pinot noir, funk and cherries. Taste is might good with some sour, pinot, yeast, cherries and a hint of vanilla. Quite delicious and well balanced. 462 charactershops202, Mar 16, 2014

Supplication pours a dark opaque red. There is minimal carbonation and almost no lacing. The smell is strong - mainly sour cherries, but the red wine barrel is there too. The taste is brilliant - such well balanced fruit and tartness. Despite the tartness, I could (and have) drink this beer several times over.

A - Red pour with visible carbonation. Thin head that settles fast. No lacing. Clear hue. Really perfect for the style.
S - Sour cherries, vanilla, and oak hit the nose. You can really smell the pinot noir coming through this beer as it absorbed the wine notes. 
T - Rich cherry flavor that ends with a tart finish. The wild yeast gives it a nice blend of funk. The aging allows some reserved oaken pulp in the finish as well. Some vanilla bean balances this out with a little sweetness.
M - One of the easiest drinking sour beers I've ever come across. Scratch that, it is. just a perfect balance of sweet to tart notes. 
O - I am not an expert on this style but I don't know how this could be better. This is why RR is on that elite level. And this is why American craft can accomplish anything when craftsmen brew this quality of beer. Just a wow moment drinking this one. 916 characterssocon67, Mar 11, 2014

Bottled on 10/21/2013. Enjoyed on 3/5/2014.
Poured from the bottle into two Prohibition Pig snifters.
Pours a nice hazy medium red with minimal head that quickly dissipates.
Smell is of brett, some good funk, hayfield and cherries. Some wine notes as well.
Taste is delicious and showcase the tart brett, the cherries and the Pinot from the barrels. It's complex, and wonderful.
Mouthfeel is dry and tart. It's perfect for the brett.
Overall, I loved the beer. I have just recently had another cherry brett, The Alchemist's Petit Mutant. I felt the cherries were more prominent in the Petit Mutant, but Supplication had the Pinot Noir notes. 
This is a world class beer. 736 charactersBoldRulerVT, Mar 06, 2014

Pours a dark red color, somewhat opaque, with a one finger off white head on top. Aroma of sour cherries, vinegar, vinous grape notes. Very nice. Flavor is a medley of sour cherries and vinegar first, but with some beautiful oak and vinous notes that give this a huge punch of flavor and depth. Lots of bretty funk and big lacto bite. The wine notes continue to emerge as it warms. Some nice sweetness that balances out the sour beautifully. Full bodied for a sour brew, with lots of carbonation. A top rated beer for good reason. This is honestly one of the best beers I've ever had. 630 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 05, 2014

Pours a cloudy peach bronze, some particulate matter in the brew. Bit of white lacing for a head. 
Smells of almond, cherries, and slightly of sweet melon. 
Flavor is sweet like Belgian candi sugar followed by potent tartness like tart apples, cherries, and a hint of lemon. There is a sweet banana bread flavor underneath, barely detectable over the strong tartness. 
Medium body with light bubbly carbonation on the roof of the mouth.
Truly exceptional among sour beers. Maybe not quite Rodenbach Grand Cru, but then again I could see myself drinking this more readily than that. Undoubtedly top tier. 616 charactersCylinsier, Mar 04, 2014

The sweet/sour tartness this beer delivers from the interplay of pinot and cherry is something that remains within my palate memory as a top 5 all time beer flavor. Thats not even mentioning the beautiful appearance (the light rose fluffy 2 finger head and hazy reddish amber beer hue) 336 charactersoldmankoch, Mar 02, 2014

The aroma is cherry with some brett spiciness that is much more subdued in the flavor of the beer. The beer had lots of carbonation but not as much as champagne. The beer was dry with some sweetness and lots of fruit flavor with cherry being the dominant fruit flavor. The beer was sour but it was not overwhelming. The beer finishes tart with a slight bitterness. The beer had a ruby red/ caramel color to it. I was very impressed with this beer and I really enjoyed it. 529 charactersi4ourgot, Feb 22, 2014

Tremendous lace sticking to the glass. Aroma was a bit sour and unfortunately, I think I was picking up hints of the sanitation in the glass. Flavor had a mild puckering tang, no hop bitterness and not too sweet. Carbonation was average and viscosity was above average. Delicious aftertaste. This was worth the price for a special treat. 442 charactersBVukelich, Feb 08, 2014

A- Pours a reddish-brown medium garnet color with a small slightly pink head that dissipated to a very thin ring. Nice degree of clarity. 
S- Sour cherry with some light sweet cherry in there. Lots of barnyard funk and sour apple, slight hint of alcohol. 
T- Lots of sour and funk. Sour cherry, not as much as in the aroma. Get some light cereal grain in the finish. 
M- Medium, long sourness in the mouth. Very fitting for the style. 
O- Some American sours I've had don't deliver on the funk and sourness but this one certainly does. This is one of the best examples of a sour beer I've had. The fruit is there as a support to the funk and sour. It is definitely a sipper of a beer but for all the right reasons. Certainly a beer to seek out if you love sour beers. 838 charactersPaulyB83, Feb 06, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my favorite RRB and beer in general. It has opened my eyes to the potential of sour beers. The cherry flavor is exquisite.
Note: This beer is extremely sour. Don't expect to chug this or even think about ordering this without time to slowly drink and enjoy. Even though I love this, I cannot make myself drink this fast. The sourness is so extreme that it takes some time to adjust to. It is kind of like getting hit in the head with a heavy object.
But the sour cherry flavor makes it my favorite beer by far. I live near RRB and probably drink one 375ML bottle of this beer every week. I don't even care that it costs ~$13. It is worth it. 651 charactersNickBiller, Feb 04, 2014

A. Bright amber. Translucent. Poured minimal head that retreats to a fine rim. 
S. Tart. Sour fruits of cherries, apples, grapes, and persimmon. Sour bacteria. Neutral oak. Clean and crisp. 
T. Super tart. Follows the nose with sour fruit, light malts, sour yeast, and bretts. 
M. Crisp and clean. Extremely smooth to the 3rd degree. Low carbonation. Light body.
O. This lives up to the hype. I would go to great lengths for this again. It's way sour but in an excellent way. Super clean. One of the best sours brewed in the U.S. 590 charactersmacher0, Feb 01, 2014

S - Sour cherries, slight oaky red wine smell, but mostly cherries
T - Oak, spice followed up with sour cherries. Very complex flavors. Not quite a sour, but more sour than anything else.
M - Very refreshing for the person that likes sours. Lots of carbonation keeps this just the way I like it!
O - Extremely drinkable and very complex in flavor. Top ten beers in the world? Why not. 531 charactersThePaleRider, Jan 12, 2014

4.53/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter from a bottle purchased at City Beer in San Francisco weeks ago.
The appearance both surprised me and impressed me as I felt that the head on the beer was not typical of other sours I've tried. The head was thick, foamy and frothy and formed a finger and a half thick over the liquid. The beer was copper-colored and semi-opaque.
I was again impressed by the aromas emanating from this gem: sour cherries, dark fruit, and lots of yeastiness. It smelled light and refreshing.
The taste was everything the nose had lead me to expect. There was some wine-like tastes, dark sour cherries, other dark fruit hints, and some yeast. Truly a delicious beer.
I remember thinking this beer was champagne like, with the high carbonation, smoothness and slight creaminess, plus a dryer finish. Supplication feels like so much more than a beer. 
Overall, an outstanding beer, even though I kept thinking I was sipping a wine or maybe a champagne, I realized that Supplication is a transcendent brew. There's so much complexity here and so much good flavor. I loved this. 1,083 charactersONovoMexicano, Jan 05, 2014

A: Pleasant chestnut-brown color. 3F+ head with moderate retention, little to no lacing, but a ring.
S: Sour cherries dominate, oak and Pinot Noir, definite notes of yeast, some malts.
T: Would recommend serving closer to room temperature as opposed to fridge temperature. Sour cherries again dominate, but in balance, its not overly sour and is balanced by malt sweetness as it warms up. Oak and Pinot Noir come in as well. Finish is more sour and pretty dry despite low alcohol.
M: Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation which helps balance sourness. Well constructed.
O: It's Russian River, it's a sour beer, so it's great. Very lucky to have found a bottle here in the East. 749 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jan 05, 2014

Khaki head very creamy but fades quickly no lacing. Smell is fairly one dimensional and potent it's advertising the presence of sour cherries. Taste is all about cherries and currants it's sour but not puckeringly aggressive. There is a bit of sweetness and acid reminiscent of raspberries. A light dose of funk but thankfully not over the top and it works well here. Medium light body and brightly carbonated. Finish is cherry, tart, and dry. Definitely shows off the Pinot barrel aging. Very good. 614 charactersJackieTH, Dec 28, 2013

That being said, to find beer aged in pinot noir barrels brings a smile to my face. Supplication has a dark orange/ruby red color to it with sweet, but mainly sour cherry aromas. The taste is of tart cherries with a bit of oak and raspberry. 
I really enjoy this beer, it's sweet but still a true sour ale. 356 charactersMalWilkinson, Dec 27, 2013

A: Pours a beautiful ruby red. Tall, fizzy tan head. Almost soda-like. Fizzes out pretty quickly. Zero lacing and little head retention. 
S: Tart cherries with some leathery tannins. Hint of oak and a little sweet fruits join when swirled - sweet raspberries I'd say mostly? General berry fruitiness everywhere. 
T: Whoa, much more sour than the aroma betrays. Tart grapeskins from the wine and loads of sour cherries up front. Sour cherries don't fade, they actually get more and more tart through the middle. A little bit of raspberry sweetness and then lots of oaky, leathery tannins in the finish.
M: Medium bodied, mouth-puckeringly sour.
O: Seriously sour, I actually think this was more sour than beatification. Or maybe it's just the wine adding more layers of tartness that amplify the sour cherries. I'm not sure. Strongest/sourest cherry flavor in a beer I've ever had. A little over the top for me, but obviously well crafted. Big and bright flavors for sure. Barrel aging isn't over the top and adds quite a bit of complexity. I'm not a big fan of wine or wine barrel beers so my subjectivity is showing with my scores. It's a good beer but just not up my alley, I think. 1,205 charactersDope, Dec 03, 2013

A - Pours with a ruby translucency, head was a finger but was almost gone before I could observe it. Interesting that this was originally a brown ale as it looks nothing like that after the almost year of labor put into it.
S - Intoxicating. Sour cherries and a bit of alcohol warms the nose. Smells almost like the favorite sour cherry chewy gummy things of my youth. I know I said this on another recent review but this is one of the best smelling beers Ive ever smelled. Maybe my nose is just getting better
T - It should be mentioned that this is also my first sour ale. Interesting. The sour cherry flavor from the nose comes across slightly but the wine undertones are definitely stronger. The funk of traditional sour ales is definitely strong. Not sure this is my favorite style although if it were stronger on the sourness it would not be as tasteful I don't think. Still really enjoyable and pleasant, but with the price I will save this for really special occasions. I am curious about how it would age though, so I will probably toss a few bottles in the cellar
M - Really pleasant carbonated, a thin mouthfeel leaves the sour cherry and wine flavors sitting on your tongue to linger.
O - I'm sure if I had more context for the style I would have been wowed by this beer but as such I am a sour noob. I still loved the cherry and wine notes and think those will come out stronger as I age it (hopefully!) 1,454 characterslaglocal, Nov 27, 2013

Perfect sour with a little bit of funk like the old world sours. To many of the American sours are just sour and miss a lot of the funky barnyard flavor that a sour should have. If this beer is ever available. Don't think twice. 341 charactersvinny21bal, Nov 17, 2013

It smelled awesome. I can't even describe it. Then the taste....just awesome. Nice and bubbly. 377 charactersdetroithopluv, Oct 29, 2013

A - Cloudy, copper in color with a 1/2" head that fades to a faint white ring. Scattered carbonation bubbles float throughout the glass. 
S - Sweet and tart cherries on the initial whiff followed by the infamous funk. You can definitely detect the Pinot barrels on the nose. Beautiful fruit and hints of malts on the back end. Very clean aroma! 
T - Flavors of oak and sour cherries accompanied by a well balanced tartness and sourness. As a former wine junkie, you can pick up the Pinot on the finish. No presence of alcohol. 
M - A wonderful acidity while holding it in your mouth followed by a dryness once swallowed. Not overly sweet and the sourness delivers spectacularly. 
O - This was well worth the wait! I've 5 bottles staring at me for months and decided that they had sat long enough. I cannot wait to try some of the year old bottles that I have as this can only get better with age. Seek this out and you will be delightfully satisfied! 1,020 charactersCubatobaco, Oct 06, 2013

Pours a copper color with some floaties and a minimal white head. Smell is tart cherries, oak and a little Pinot. Taste is tart cherries and raspberries, I get a little bit of Pinot and oak. Not as tart as I expected. Medium bodied with a higher amount of carbonation and a little dry. Overall it is very good, I just expected a little more due to its current ranking. 411 charactersJas45678, Sep 30, 2013

A: Pours a dark reddish/copper colored body. Dense, frothy head runs down the glass with no lacing but settles into a silky rim reminiscent of a latte.
S: Tart cherries. Mega funk. Oak. Brown sugary sweetness. Apple cider. Grapefruit and citrus. This smells brilliant.
T: Wow. There is a ton of funky sweet tart, balanced with loads of cherries and a white grape juice flavor in the finish. There is a perfect amount of oak to balance and round the whole thing out.
M: Heavy carbonation. Medium body. Puckering tart. Prickly. Dry.
O: Every bit of the hype is warranted on this one. Mind bending good. 621 charactersJustin_Neff, Sep 12, 2013

4.31/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pale brown with a good amount of brown head that dissipates very quickly, leaving nearly zero carbonation at the top of the brew. Active, visible carbonation in the brew. Sweet fruit in the nose, cherries and apricot come to mind. Some Belgian yeast and and subtle bitterness from hops are present with a little bread aroma with a swirl. Fresh baked white to be exact, for you perfectionists (goes with the pale malt). Grape aroma is very evident, especially with multiple whiffs; pinot is very evident and some might argue a little overpowering. Dark fruit hits the palate at first: cherries, apricots, sour date (is that possible?), then light fruit, such as green grape and pear, then sourness and bitterness. This last combo is face-punching. Seriously. The mouth feel is wet and sloshy, very thin, which is a contrast to the flavors.
This is a very flavorful, complex beer. Then comes the sourness! Woah! I ain't kidding! This needs to be more balanced for me. I really wanted to like it, especially after having consecration, but it just didn't hold up. If you really enjoy sour beers, then this is for you. I guess I'm just not up to the task right now.
---
After nearly two years since my initial review, I felt it time to revisit this one.
Pours a leathery copper color with big, effervescent head that fades quickly. The aroma is complex, but not overreaching. Cherries, dates, plum, and other darker pit fruit along with cranberries, lingonberries, and other tart berries. The malt is subtle, but there with a dark bread presence, like pumpernickel. The light berries (cranberry, etc.) dominate with a subtle bit of overcooked wheat crust. The sourness is most like vinegar, but the darkness in the flavor offsets it a bit. I also get some oak and it's not too subtle. The dryness of the finish really helps balance the oak, as I'm one that can think it's overbearing too easily. Sourness is substantial but not overpowering. I hardly puckered my face this time. The finish is only somewhat bitter, and I can tell the hops are not their best, which really helps keep the focus on the sour and barrel aspects of this brew. The feel is light, even for a sour. 
This is a great beer, but not one to reach for other than a special occasion. The sourness isn't overpowering like before, though maybe I'm just more used to sours. The only big flaw is its lack of depth. This beer can wear on you quickly, especially when warmed. 2,446 charactersPhilousa, Aug 27, 2013

A: Gorgeous ruby red body, hazy. Some floaties at the bottom of the glass. Thin head that has some decent retention.
S: Tart cherries, good amount of oak, pinot. As advertised and amazing!
T: I'm not a sour connoisseur, I've only had a few. This isn't as sour as the others I've had, but I'm OK with that. The pinot/oak flavors hit the tongue first. Then puckering sour cherry that finishes sour and dry. Very unique and RR did a great job with this.
M: Heavy carbonation, which works for the style. Dry like a red wine.

3.84/5  rDev -14.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle dated April 11, 2013. Tried on August 23rd, 2013. 
I had very high expectations for this beer. But in comparision with some other sours I've indulged in lately - Cascade, Crooked Stave, etc - this one was lacking. I have two major complaints: 
1) The bottle I tried just wasn't very sour. On a 1:10 sour scale, this one probably ranks a 2 or a 3. Definitely not as sour as Cascade and Bruery's sours, for example. I was expecting much more of a acetic kick and this beer just didn't deliver. 
2) The complexity was somewhat lacking for my taste. Again - with the batch I tried - the red wine/Pinot overpowered the cherries. To my palate, it tasted much more like a wine/beer hybrid than a sour beer brewed with cherries. I'd take down the barrel aging a notch and kick up the cherries.
Supplication is a good - maybe great - sour. But when measured against its reputation, the bottle I had fell short. To that end, it reminds me alot of Pliny - a very well-regarded beer surpassed by other beers in the same genre but still highly regarded based on name recognition. For sour-heads, this bottle is a must-try simply based on what it is. But for my money, there are better sours out there. 1,213 charactersMighHighBrewer, Aug 25, 2013

375 mL bottle poured into a tulip at cellar temperature.
L – Hazy deep amber color with a 1-finger bubbly cream-colored head that fades rapidly into a ring of froth around the edge of the glass. Not much lacing.
S – Unbelievably complex. Sour cherries burst out right away, but on further analysis, I get Pinot Noir notes including more cherries and raspberries, obviously lots of tart lactic acidity, dry oak, some musty Brett, and a nice helping of sweet caramel and brown sugar malt. There’s more going on here as well, but this is what I can gather.
T – It starts off immediately sour with cherry, raspberry, and grape flavors followed soon by sweet caramel malt and brown sugar as soon as the acidity fades. As the taste progresses dry oak and musty, funky Brett appear and pair well together. Really, really tasty.
F – Medium-bodied, great carbonation, an effervescent, tart, sticky, and mouth-coating feel, and a sweet, sour, earthy, musty, and dry finish. There are so many flavors that meld together wonderfully and linger that I can’t just pick out a few. This whole beer comes together at the finish and is spectacular.
O – This is a fantastic beer and a great sour. It’s extraordinarily drinkable for a sour beer at nearly 8% ABV, I think due to the sweeter elements that balance out the sour ones. It’s very complex but very approachable at the same time. By that I mean that there are aromas and flavors that scream out at you but there are also layers upon layers of other aromas and flavors if you keep digging. Really my only complaint as others have said is that I wish it was in a bigger bottle so I could have more. The price is a little tough, too, especially for a bottle this size, but it really is a fantastic beer. Thank you so much for the opportunity to try this one, Jared! 1,911 charactersBlackBelt5112203, Aug 15, 2013

Deep copper in color with a thin, cream-colored, head, this had a softer nose than I expected; subdued scents of cherries and grapes, with a little bit of oak. On my initial taste the beer is only moderately tart, and flavors include cherries, grape must, and fresh blackberries from early in the season; it finishes dry with traces of oak. Hardly any sweetness at all. The carbonation I do sense quickly dissipates. Nearly as good as the bottle I remembered... 507 charactersbeerloverofbham, Aug 08, 2013

Supplication
Poured into a snifter, pours a bright copper color . Had excellent clarity, though the head does die quickly. Aroma of funky bugs, cider vinegar, cherry, oak, and brown sugar. Has a sour aroma overall, which to a fan of wild ales, is quite delighting.
In the taste, puckering sourness, cherry pit, apple cider, lemon juice, vinegar, with a snappy lactic/acetic boom. Tart to sour, musty, oaky, and semi dry. Has the taste of white wine, not surprising through the stated use of Pinot Noir barrels. Mild herbal bitterness, the sourness really is the bite to this brew. Has a medicinal note, and the fruitiness of the cherry grows in the aftertaste.
A medium bodied, well carbonated offering, full of flavor. There is an oaky dryness with lingering fruit and sour notes sticking to the palate. Minutes after sipping there is still a strong sour flavor. This is a sipper meant to be savored.
Supplication makes for a great addition to any glass or beer cellar. Quite sour, mildly fruity, and full of wild ale funk. Enjoyable through and through, thanks to GodsBrother for picking me up a bottle from the brewery. Lovely stuff. 1,154 charactersStinkypuss, Aug 04, 2013

A: 2/3 - orange-brown coloration, minimal clarity (cannot see through), off-brown/white head dissipates into small glass lacings, surprising big alcohol legs for a 7.00%ABV concoction
S: 11/12 - lots of pungent sour notes admixed with cherries and mild tannins imparted by the use Pinot Noir bottles; really enticing aroma
T: 19/20 - on the anterior tongue, there's a strong sourness - vinegar, sour cherries and even some apple cider notes, in the middle of the mouth, some of the vinous qualities start to rear their head - tannins, grapes and stone fruit; the alcohol is present but certainly not overwhelming in the taste with some minor malt characters to hint at balancing
M: 5/5 - moderate bodied and appropriately carbonated for an American wild ale; really nice dry, crisp finish that doesn't linger with a puckering sourness
O: 10/10 - as opposed to some of their other beers, which I believe have a tendency to be overrated, this one lives up to the hype; on numerous levels, it's just about a perfect sour - tart, refreshing, dry with a complex aroma and flavor; cheers to Vinny C. for reinforcing my faith in the power of the sour!

AP: Nice rich amber and reddish rusty colour. Initial head was about 1" but faded quickly to 1/8". Had that nice acidic sizzle sound of the carbonation with small tight little bubbles flowing from bottom to top.
AR: Has that classic aroma I associate with Wild Ales, Lambics, Sours, Flanders, etc., which is like taking a hard sourdough pretzel and liquefying it. Apple cider/vinegar notes as well with grape skins and cherries, a bit of barrel mustiness, too. Great nose on this.
T: Very much like the nose. The balance of the sour and acidity is nearly perfect. Nice apple cider like flavour with rye sourdough grains. The addition of the cherries and Pinot Noir barrel add great depth to this. They blend well with the base of the beer. After the initial cider taste, the fruits come softly rolling in, like putting a couple of dark grapes and a cherry in your mouth and biting down on them. I also get a bit of plum as well. A very well rounded beer. 
M: Neither the sourness nor tartness are too much here. In fact, they are just about right. Good carbonation, crisp and acidic on the tongue, palate cleansing but a nice viscous feel from the fruit and barrel to make for a rather smooth finish.
OV: I'm really wishing this was a 500ml bottle right now. I love Wild Ales and Sours and this beer is delicious. Well done base with the addition of cherries and PN barrel mixing well and making this a well rounded treat. 1,609 charactersGuinnessAtRogerWilco, Jul 24, 2013

A- Pours a pretty reddish-brown color with a thin half-inch head that dissipated rather quickly. Not much lacing, but I was drinking it from a hotel glass of dubious cleanliness. Minimal but sufficient effervesence.
S- Definitely started with the unmistakable odor of sweet and sour cherries, with fruity notes that smacked of raisins, dates, and currants. I caught some sweet malt back there, too, but it was elusive.
T- Wow...clean, dry, tart...reminded me of a fine champagne. Very complex with a nice fresh finish that left me wanting another sip. As I savored it, I also was reminded of a fleeting bourbon-like woody taste, with a faint but perceptible spiciness. Overall, a great balance between all the flavors.
M- Outstanding. Not too thin, very crisp and dry, the tartness faded quickly, leaving a clean puckering feeling to my mouth. 
O- I picked this one up from a Denver liquor store, and I had to ask for Russian River products, which they had stashed in the back. Now I know why. I wasn't disappointed. American Wid Ales are just awesome, and this is my second brew from the style. Overall, absolutely incredible, to be enjoyed any time of year. Absolutely delicious and highly recommended. 1,266 charactersKnuckles_Nuclear, Jul 23, 2013

The beer appeared a very nice dark red color with a highly carbonated, off-white head that dissipated in a matter of moments. The beer gave off a nice sour cherry aroma with a hint of something, but I can't place it. The taste of the beer is unbelievably good. Sweet and sour, with sour more dominate, cherries, a hint of alcohol. The beer had a good feel to it, light and very smooth. It left a nice dry aftertaste. Overall, an outstanding sour, which hopefully I will get to enjoy again.
I also bought a bottle at Capone's (Norristown, PA) before heading back home, since you can't get this stuff in Georgia. Bottled: 04 11 13 689 charactersPhillyStyle, Jul 20, 2013

It has a nice acidity. Cherry, red wine vinegar, Some oak. Not a huge smell as far as sours go. A little sweetness balances. Excited to drink it. 
More sour than I was expecting from the nose, but not as big as some. The acidity doesn't linger long. It rounds out really quickly. There is an astringent bitterness that hits as the sourness falls of, then the cherry flavor sets in. This flavor is very raw and natural. I don't get a lot of juiciness, but instead I get a cherry flesh flavor. Really nice. Flavors are cherry (of course), red wine vinegar, green apple, and lemon. Also taste some oakiness, but again, this is a very raw (wood bark) flavor.
Medium-high carb medium body, and I swear I feel some tannin on my tongue from the cherry and pinot noir. I also get the tannin bitterness. Really nice.
This was an excellent beer. To me, it didn't quite live up to the hype, but I still really enjoyed that complex and raw flavors. No doubt that this beer is complicated. Nice sourness that's not over the top. A pretty easy drinker, actually. 1,156 characterslunarbrew, Jul 17, 2013

A - Dark ruby brown with 1.5 finger off white head. Dissipates into a thick collar that remains for the session as streams of bubbles travel up from the bottom. Little to no lacing.
S - Wicked tart cherries and notes of oak barrel. I get wiffs of Pinot and sour apple. Some faint acidic red vinegar is in there. 
T - Big blast of sour cherry right away, sour apples and some vinegar and lemon follow. Smooths out in the middle with some oak, wine and sour grape. Minimal sweetness is present. Finishes with a good sour note.
M - Lighter body with a dry and tart finish that lingers for a bit. Carbonation is very good.
O - Very good sour beer that gets a good bit of flavor from the added cherries and aging in the wine barrels. Definitely deserves its spot in top 10 of the top 250 of BA. 865 charactersRi0, Jul 14, 2013

Appearance - Body is a translucent brown with bits of sediment and highlights of rust and burnt ochre. Holding the light behind it reveals raspberry red highlights. Head is a little less than a finger of bubbly, sudsy head the color of faded rose quartz. Dissipates fairly quickly leaving little to no lacing.
Smell - Notes of sour cherries and faint cinnamon along with the backbone of pinot aroma and hints if wine-like tannins. I also detect some notes of apple cider vinegar peeking through as well.
Taste - Tartness up front, with notes of green apple and lemon that evolves into a more complex depth of flavor, with some grape must and elements of malty sweetness to balance the sourness. Sour flavor profiles stand out more as the beer warms.
Mouthfeel - Slightly puckering, with a high level of effervescence and a medium-to-light body. Finish is mostly dry, with a slightly sweet lingering aftertaste.
Overall, a fantastic sour beer that has a good balance of sour and fruit. I would drink this all the time if it was easily attainable. 1,181 charactersLambicPentameter, Jul 11, 2013

4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is our last beer from Russian River. This is also the highest rated on BeerAdvocate. We need to take a trip to the Russian River Valley so we can visit the brewery. Their beers are made in pretty small batches, and they don't get great distribution. I landed this, and all of the other beers from them, in a trade. Speaking of trades, I just bought 14 bottles/cans tonight for a massive trade I am doing with Ashley Bower. REALLY looking forward to that one. She is sending us a bottle of Mexican Cake. It's not on the list, but I am pumped to try it. 
It was cool learning about the owners of Russian River Brewing Company and their love for Pinot Noir wine. I like Pinot Noir, too. This beer was aged for a year in Pinot Noir barrels. I am fickle when it comes to barrel aged beers, but I have some pretty big expectations for this one. I bet this is sour, too. I could smell this as I was pouring it… and it smells quite sour. I am going to stop talking… let's drink! 
In the Glass: This is quite carbonated, and it was producing a ton of bubbles and a nice thick white head as I was pouring it. I could smell, as I was pouring it, the subtle sourness that I am looking forward to. The head just sits there and while the beer doesn't have much lace, the head makes me want to grab a spoon and start eating! I hope this beer smells good. 
Oh, the beer has a nice amber color to it. I am sure some of that color comes from the Pinot Noir barrels. It says on the bottle that this is aged 9 to 15 months. I wonder how they decide how long to age a particular beer like this.
Nose: It doesn't smell as sour as I expected it to. I am getting some of those tannins that you get when smelling a well balanced Pinot Noir. In the back of my mind I want this to taste more like a glass of wine than a beer. The bubbles, however, leave me to think I am going to have an experience as if I was drinking champagne. A second sniff has me smelling more fruit and I am sure it reads weird, but it smells expensive. Is that weird?
Flavor: The beer is not as carbonated as I expected it to be, but it is quite sour. Good thing I like sour beers. There is a lot going on here with the flavor and it really changes as it slides across your palate. There are some bubbles when it first hits your lips, and then it begins to really open up as you swallow. There is a ton of flavor in the aftertaste, too, leaving this beer a wide range of awesome! The sour quickly fades leaving you a hint of those tannin that I keep talking about. 
Mouthfeel: There are a ton of bubbles at first, but it's not overwhelming. I wouldn't recommend swishing this around in your mouth much. I did that on my second sip, and the sour flavor really comes through. But the bubbles become overwhelming. If you don't like sour beers, stay away. As you swallow, the beer mellows out and you are left with a nice thin layer of sweetness every time you swallow. This beer is well produced and that is obvious every step of the way. 
Aftertaste: That is my favorite part of this beer. As soon as you swallow you are hit with some subtle dryness that just coats your tongue with flavor. I have been sitting on this last sip for a good 5 minutes and I feel/taste like I just took a sip. I don't know the process of aging a beer in a wine barrel, but there has got to be some trial and error to realize the beer is ready after 9 months or not quite ready until it hits 15 months. 
Speaking of barrel aged beers, the last time we tried Sirius Black, a killer beer from Four Peaks Brewing Company, I talked with someone from the brewery. He said the batch we were trying, at a tap takeover at Hops On Birch, had been aged for 12 months in a barrel. I am not sure I could be that patient pouring a beer as good as Sirius Black into a barrel just to wait a year! That is what makes cellering beer so tough.
We can't get Russian River beers here, but if we could I would be broke. This, along with all the other "-ation" beers we have tried/reviewed, is great. The more sour the better. Cheers, people! 4,063 charactersrickyleepotts, Jul 03, 2013

4.94/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Awesome beer. Reminded me of Berliner Weise from Germany. I had it last Sunday at Russian River's pub in Santa Rosa, California.
Here is how they describe the beer on their beer chart:
Supplication: It is a brown ale aged for 12-15 months in used Pinot Noir barrels with Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus yeast strains added to each barrel. It also has sour cherries added to the barrel. The sour cherries and flavor from the Pinot Noir barrels dominate the aroma and flavor with a mild acidity and dry finish. 7 percent ABV.
I had it as part of a beer flight - and then followed that up with a pint of the beer. Really unique. You can taste the Brettanomyces which I think produces the sweet/sour taste. The cherry taste was also dominant.
We went to Russian River to drink the Pliny the Elder Double IPA - which is an excellent beer - but I may have enjoyed this beer more than the Pliny. 905 charactersMGoBlue93, Jun 29, 2013

A very very nice. Bright orange color around the rim as i poured.
S musty. a little funky but not as pungent as i would have thought based on other reviews
T tart!!! It is sour but i would describe it as tart as opposed to sour. Got lots of tart cherries and a funky oaky note. very nice. bitter dry puckering aftertaste.
M again very nice. much less carbonation than other sours ive had
O very good beer. This bottle was only a few months old. With a little age this beer would be incredible. As it is, its very good. I thought it was much more drinkable than consecration and although it is very tart/sour, it could be a good intro to sours for the average ba. 806 charactersDrewskiWhit, Jun 29, 2013

This beer when opened provided a great smell of tart and cherries. Moving foward, we poured the gleaming off centered gold into our tulip glasses. We then drank. As it hit my pallet I was amazed by the light sour yet flavorful filled beer that possesed me. Why not add that last cherry tart taste to top it off, well they did it and they Russian River did this one right. 
Never would pass a bottle of this, I would never trade a bottle of this, and Never would I not open it for a very special occasion. 678 charactersJonathanC, Jun 25, 2013

The aroma is vinegar tart, but really huge on the fruit character. Not as red wine as Consecration. It’s definitely more sour, more sweet, and more sweet than Consecration.
The flavor is hugely. You get a bit of the wine character, but Pinot does not stand out as much as Cabernet for Consecration. The cherry is not huge in there, but you do get a hint of it in the back. The beer is not for those who do not like sours. It really is strongly puckering. One of the most sours beers I’ve had.
The mouthfeel is quite light on this. It does not have a huge carbonation. Despite being in a longer time than Consecration, it does not have as big of wine characteristic.
I was actually a bit disappointed by this. I do love the fruit and sweetness, but the sourness is a bit strong. It could use more complexity. Still a wonderful beer. 880 charactersdar482, Jun 20, 2013

Smells of fruity cherries, barnyard/hay, funk, and tart cherries. Taste shines right with the smell with a glorious burst of dark cherry, morphing into tart cherry, then transforming into a beautiful barnyard funk, with some horseblanket and hay, followed by wet dirt (think moist turned up soil), and light lactic sourness. Mouthfeel is spot on, bracing carbonation that carries the flavors around without being too abrasive. Must buy, must try for the sour fan. 568 characterstaylor714914, Jun 19, 2013

Brownish red colour, ring of off white head, not much in the way of lace. Smell is Full of cherry and oak, funky, tart acidity, fruity and some light balsamic with only a little bit of sweetness. Taste is funky, lots of tart cherry flavours, fairly big puckering sourness to it, oak and wine flavours, more cherry in the aftertaste. Medium high carbonation, medium body. Just fantastic, no trace of alcohol at all, just a straight up excellent sour, 375ml is too easy to drink. 498 characterspeensteen, Jun 17, 2013

S: Moderate to strong aromas of Pinot Noir barrels are present in the nose along with notes of oak. 
T: The taste is similar to the smell and also has notes of sourness and cherries, the latter of which particularly stand out in the finish.

A couple mm thick head is present. It's a pretty solid foam that appears to be going no where for a while. There is some sediment at the bottom but partly my fault the way I poured it.
Smell: Definitely funky! It's honestly hard to describe but the best I can come up with is fermented tart cherries. Just taking a whiff of this smell and I think whoa something was a lot of fermentation happening in there. There is also notable wine characteristics.
Taste: At first when I take a sip, the sourness and tartness just slaps me across the face. It's almost pungent but in a palatable way plus a bitter component as I move the beer around the mouth. Plenty of sweetness, possibly from the cherries. Wow! Every swallow of a mouthful of this beer is one attack after another. It stays tart the entire time. There are also tart cherries that is easily noticeable. I'm new to sours but this really impressed me. After I finish a sip of the beer I get some flavor of dried cherries at the back of the tongue. The acidity of this beer stays after I finish the sip. 
Mouthfeel: it has a medium mouthfeel to it and moderately carbonated. 
Overall: This is one heck of a sour beer. Like I said, I've never had many sours so I won't ever forget this one. I hope I can get this again. 1,373 charactersBenish, Jun 12, 2013

A: Pours a brownish orange with a 3/4 finger off-white head with small bubbles. Head fades quickly. In the glass, this thing is a beautiful reddish-copper with brown notes. 
S: You really have to get in there to get a good nose on this one, but when you do - wow. Sweet, tart cherries, little bit of vinegar, definite funk with some leather notes. Really nice.
T: Whoa. Hang on. Balance. Right up front, you are hit with the tartness. And then some funk. But towards the end, you get some sweet cherry and fruit notes. Some definite wine notes from the barrels. The funk adds another dimension to this beer. terrific stuff.
M: Pretty much perfect. Not too carbonated, very refreshing.
O: Super impressed. This one is a winner. I keep delving deeper into the "tion" series, and continue to be very pleased. I would have this any time. Great stuff! 888 charactersmontrealbcr89, Jun 09, 2013

I can't say I've every smelled a beer that had that familiar a smell of a really good wine. Even my wife, who is much more a vinophile than I am, smelled it, she was impressed. Combine that with a phenomenal sour ale, and you've got a sure winner. Absolutely phenomenal, perfect beer. If I could find a stock of this, I'd buy everything they had. 435 charactersBrianJohnson, Jun 08, 2013

Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the beer was a deep magenta color with a slight bubbly white head. The aroma, best described as a flowery cherry aroma, was enchanting. In the initial taste, one detects notes of tart and sour cherry, grape skin, sour grapes, sour fruit, and a hint of vanilla from the barrel aging. The vanilla notes come to the front more as the beer progresses toward the aftertaste. The pleasantly acidic mouthfeel is allowed to linger momentarily as the ale's thickness lingers on the back of the tongue. I could easily drink this sour before any other. I like it a lot. 787 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jun 08, 2013
4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Though listed as a wild ale, I'll go out on a limb and say that this is what every sour should aim for in terms of profile. It pours a burned red-orange to pink with some lacing. The aroma is out of this world. There are definite hints of cherry and pinot noir as advertised, but I also pick up a hint of eggnog, oddly enough. The taste follows the aroma. There's a definite mouth-puckering cherry tartness that quickly fades to a dry, clean finish. The sourness is very pronounced, and I think it may mask other flavors that are present. Nevertheless, this is one of the best sours I've ever had. 597 characterstbdkev, Jun 07, 2013

Lacing was pretty nice looked like a big ring off foam then seperates into little sexy streams that go down the glass. It has one finger of foam that likes to hang, but knows when to leave.
Smell: Smell is nice. I get that very nice pinot noir smell with a little funk, as in 70's popular good funk. Sour cherries of course come through. That sourness just makes my mouth water though.
Taste: OH MY GOD! This was my first introduction into wild ale. What a start! I want to buy as much at my secret location as I can. What a wonderful elixir this drink is. First I get hit with this wonderful taste of tart but sweet ranier cherries with that juicy acidity of a peach and a little hint of a granny smith apples with the texture of a red delicious. Hmmm... I want a nice tart granny smith right now. Then it changes into this little leathery spicey, I felt a faint vanilla presence and a little bitterness like the white fleshy part of grapefruit, wonderful oaky pinot noir that then introduces and pairs well with the yeastiness and then you get a hint of the malt on the finish. That sour grape cherry pinot mixture turned that funky yeast into something fantastic. Try an onion dish with it and you will get a taste akin to dried snap peas. You can taste the alcohol if you look for it, but why look for it and just enjoy this fantastic flavor
Mouth feel: The mouthfeel is very sweet and juicy. The alcohol is almost non-present. The body is a medium light feel. With perky carbonation. Good feel overall.
Overall: What nice intro to wild ales. Definitely one of my top beers I have tasted so far. I will return! Glad I forked out the money for this masterpiece of a brewsky. 1,739 charactersjoslin2a, Jun 06, 2013

A: Average appearance. Light colored, golden yellow, nothing extraordinary here.
S: Bitter and raw. Pungent. Smells like one would expect this beer to smell. Definitely some fruit in there, but as usual my senses were overwhelmed by the sour smell.
T: Taste takes a few sips to get used to. But when I did, it was great. Bitter, sour, but enjoyable. Not sour enough to make me pucker up, but definitely had the taste profile I expected.
M: Good. Nothing special here. 527 charactersjoel_j, Jun 05, 2013

Pale red to tan in color. Little head or lacing to speak of. 
Smell is minimal, but slight sour notes.
Taste is unbelievable. Higher then average carbonation, and finishes very sour. Citrus and notes of vinegar more then anything else.

M- The mouthfeel is perfect for the style, light to medium with high carbonation.

4.44/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25We crack the cage and cork on a bottle of “Batch 006X1”, pouring a brew of burnt sienna coloring into our Founders snifters. It holds a two finger head of creamy, chunky khaki colored bubbles, showing excellent retention. Speckled ridges of lacing are left around the glasses as it goes at a slower pace. Despite our best efforts, thick waves of haze permeate the clarity, with massive chunks of yeasty sediment found here and there. Carbonation appears to be moderate. The aroma is robustly tart off the bat, with musky woodiness, lactic acidity, biting Brett, soured cherry skin and pit, lemon zest, perfumed booziness, juicy yeastiness, and dirty flower water. These blend, sitting high against the filler, base notes of chalk, phenolic plastics, tinny metallics, toasted amber and brown malts, raw barley, and sweeter flesh of the cherries and browned pears. Our first impression is, well, I forget because I’m still trying to get back into my seat after that beastly tongue-punch of a sip. In all seriousness the flavoring is huge, soured, and generously inclusive of all the advertised components, and more. As we sip, the taste takes off with a flash of cidery sweetness before it’s decimated by lemon flesh, monstrous Bretty bite, chemicals and vinyl plastics, lactic vinegar acidity, coppery metallics, drying oaked woodiness, cereal sweetness, and a raw brown malt base. Moving to the peak is bittered fermented dark cherry skins, resiny pinot sweetness and oiliness, moldy lemon rind, metallic zing, and more salty, syrupy brown malts. The end comes with pollen nectar wash, Brett and lacto bite, balsamic vinegar, continued metallics, chalky cherry and red wine grape skins, warming, musky oakiness, and soft booziness. The aftertaste is massively fumy, with bacterial, yeasty airs, and only a slight hint of fusel alcohols, with sourdough breadiness, pumpernickel rind, grapefruity bitterness, juicy Brett, red apple sweetness, toasty pales and browns, puckered red wine, and smoky licorice. The body is medium, and the carbonation is solidly medium, with the prickle, albeit light, adding worlds to the pucker. The mouth is left slick and oily, with final green-stick astringency. Each sip gives soft and creamy slurp, froth, smack, and sticky finishing pop. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks excellently as a sipper.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. Before you even have this guy it does a really, really good job of raising your expectations. Now, often this can lead to one being let down or disappointed, but here you are left feeling neither. Each flavor that you expect is swaddled beautifully in a blanket of soured yeastiness, bacterial infection, and solid base sweetness. The fruity bite adds to both the sweet and sour side of things, while the pinot noir woodiness adds not only flavoring, but helps to fix the mouth in a persistent, but happy, pucker. The ultimate blend is truly wonderful in its simplistic complexity. 2,997 charactersTheBrewo, May 26, 2013

Batch 5
A: Slightly hazy, medium amber color with an off-white peripheral ring of small bubbles. Light lacing remains on the glass.
S: Red fruit--a pleasant combination of berries and cherries--and musty oak are both featured prominently. Bacterial culture is also detectable, although not overpowering or detracting. Qualities suggest extreme transformation of beer-type ingredients, with practically nothing recognizable as malt or hops.
T: Begins off-dry, with dynamic stone fruit and sourness that seems explosively intense at first exposure but becomes quite comfortable as the beer warms. Oak also takes a few beats to develop, but once present it infuses the flavor profile from beginning to end. Some yeast funk turns the middle into a tidy, well-ventilated goat pasture. A whiff of sulfurous bitterness toward the finish is like green wild mustard stems.
M: Thin to medium viscosity, wet and cooling on the palate while acidity is confined to the throat, with moderate carbonation.
D/O: One of Russian River's signature wine barrel-aged wild ales, Supplication excels at finding the happy medium between the golden Temptation and the high gravity Consecration. While the former is overtly wine-affected and the latter is challenging for almost any palate, this is just right. It successfully captures the mood of an authentic Belgian Kriek, at times comparable to lambics and Flanders-style ales. It deserves to be held up as one of the superlative examples of why Russian River beer is so good. 1,557 charactersbeagle75, May 24, 2013

S - relatively soft aroma. Pedio/lacto sourness, sour cherry, oak, soft malt and pinot noir.
T - is similar to the aroma. Sour cherry dominates upfront, but not intense like a Kriek. Pinot noir and oak follows the cherry in the finish. Very nice flavor!
M - medium body. Creamy, bubbly and slightly oily. Quite acetic with a long and really pleasantly warm winey finish.
O - absolutely delicious. The pinot noir barrels compliment a sour cherry ale very nicely. 594 charactersGuzzLah, May 19, 2013

A – Pours a deep red, almost bordering on some purple notes. A frothy white head quickly fizzles away, but plenty of energetic carbonation keeps running all around. I was careful with the pour, so it is perfectly clear without any stray yeast floating around.
S – Big sour grape and apple aromas careen around my sinuses. Whoa momma, this smells nice and tart. A vinegary and funky blend that is amazingly complex. Absolutely mouthwatering.
T – Holy man, this has wave upon wave of flavor, with definite shifts in the flavors that come out during each sip. Tart and crisp acidity transitions to a mix of the red wine barrels and funkiness of the Brett. This is shockingly balanced.
M – The abundant carbonation is a bit harsh, detracting from the mouthfeel a bit in my opinion. A medium-light body that is slightly drying.
O – This is a beautiful beer – brilliant complexity and balance in both the smell and the taste. This was my first Russian River sour – I hope the others are on the same tier because I will most certainly be seeking them out now. 1,237 characterswyatt13, May 13, 2013

Supplication pours a mildly translucent copper color with some very deep orange-ish hints throughout. Much like the rest of these sours, the off-white head wisps away fairly quickly without leaving anything behind to tell you that it ever existed. 
Calling the aroma of Supplication "sour" or "tart" would hardly do it justice - it is extremely tantalizing to the saliva glands from the very first whiff. Sour, black cherries, grapes, apples, huge amounts of vinous notes, most likely from the Pinot Noir barrels. Secondary, yet still integral aromas include vinegar and a solid brazing of wet oak. The funk is certainly hanging about, too; very light horsey aromas, along with some musty cellar, wet hay, and faintly cheesy funk. Highly complex, and a wonderful aroma overall.
Up front, big-time vinegar and vinous flavors immediately jump out and start thrashing my tongue right away. The oak and barrel flavors are also amplified much more on the palate than they were on the nose, coming out heavy with some large grape skins, cherries, and apple. A huge collage of a nearly fifty-fifty split of juicy fruits and more sophisticated vinous flavors. Supplication is exceedingly tart and puckering with a lasting and somewhat acidic sourness that will keep your palate on its toes the whole time.
The tartness may be dominant, but the funk is not to be forgotten. Lots of Brett shines from the middle into the finish; cork, wet wood, light barnyard, and a super dry funk to close everything out. Though it's only 7% ABV, some alcohol characteristics become noticeable upon warming, more so adding another layer of complexity rather than being a nuisance. The mouth feel is dry and crispy with heavy carbonation; thin-medium bodied, wet and slick.
Wow, yet another fantastic Russian River sour. Drinkable beyond belief, as long as you don't mind a stomach ulcer or two. I'd put this one right around the middle of the pack of their regular line-up of sours (which is saying quite a bit, because even the bottom ones in my opinion are still damn good). I prefer this to Consecration and Sanctification, it's a bit more complex and has a better balance of tart and funk. All these sours make me upset that I don't receive Russian River distribution. 2,358 characterstectactoe, May 13, 2013

S- The pinot noir is very evident and dominates the nose. Dark, sour cherries are quite present as well. Absolutely no hop aroma to speak of. Some residual fruit sweetness on the back end as well. 
T- Just like the smell, the wine is very present. Sour grapes and cherries shine through. It's almost squint worthy. It's a little yeasty but not too much. 
M- Quite tangy this one. Its lip-smackingly good but it also makes my right eye squint at times. The pinot noir resonates more than anything and I'm loving it. Very easily drinkable at 7.75% as well. 
O- Spectacular beer. It's bitey, tangy, sour, a little sweet, and complex. Awesome, unique take on a style that is constantly changing. Good stuff from RR. 
Serving Type- 12oz bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. Thanks for reading. 990 charactersDoc_Hops, May 08, 2013

Appearance: Cloudy amber with a 1/2 finger of white head that eventually recedes down to a small layer.
Smell: Intense! Definitely some barrel character, cherries, Brettanomyces, strawberries, tart sugary sweetness.
Taste: Tart cherry/strawberry sweetness hit the tip of the tongue right away. The second wave of flavor reveals the deep, complex and delicious barrel character, where the Noir notes really stand out. After the second wave passes, there is some subtle cherry remaining, but it cuts off very sharply and leads into a crisp and dry finish. It's almost like your palate is in such shock from the intense experience, that is has to reset itself for revisiting the intensity of the next sip. It finishes so clean at the end with this sudden cutoff; it's almost like someone flips an off switch at the end of every sip. 
Mouthfeel: Perfect balance of weight and carbonation. Wow.
Overall: This is hands down the best sour I've ever had. Would love to get my hands on more of this. Does that sum it up? 1,032 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Apr 27, 2013

A: Pours a beautiful red/amber with a half finger of off-white head. The foam settles fairly quickly, leaving only a velvet lining around the edges of the glass. Spotty lacing as it drinks.
S: Not to be surprised. The nose is sour with a big helping of sour cherry. I also get mild vanilla, some lacto, and a small floral component.
T: It starts out sweet, but only for a fraction of a second. The tart cherries take immediate control of this beer and refuse to let go. It's sour and tart, smooth and puckering. There is huge red cherry in the middle as it tightens up with a mild vanilla presence. The back end is super tart, drying, and palate wrecking.
M: Medium bodied beer. It's sweet to start, tart and sour in the middle, and super tart and drying in the back end. It hits the palate fast with taste-bud destroying tart, but it mellows out in the middle. It's coats the palate, is sticky, and lingers for quite awhile after the beer is gone.
O: Wonderful. This is a perfect wild ale for cherry and/or sour fans. There is a ton of fruit flavor and a good bit of mellowing oak sensibilities. I don't get a lot of brett out of this beer, but the lacto is quick intense. I prefer some of the other Russian River sours to this (not a big cherry fan) but it's undeniable that this is a world class wild. It's a sipper for sure, and I'd be through the roof to have a few more bottles of this in the future. 1,516 characterstrxxpaxxs, Apr 24, 2013

Aroma: Lots of tart cherries and sour + sweet wine grapes, all in a fantastic way. There is a sickly bittersweet scent that reminds me of a good red wine but somehow different- maybe more of the sweet rather than the bitter. A little bit of oak too. Altogether, it's a funky, sour and sweet beer that smells great. The first whiff of the nose made me excited to drink this one. (4.5)
Colour: Pours a hazy dark red-brown, almost a very dark amber with a thick 2cm off-white head that sticks around for about a minute before it bows out, leaving a foamy collar. The lacing is quite sticky and pretty. Overall, a very good looking beer. (4.25)
Flavour: Damn! This thing is sour as hell. Its got that tartness of cherry, but also that funky sourness that I've come to associate with wild yeast (thank homebrew infections). But its also got a delicious underlying sweetness that seems to come from the underlying malt- it's cherry, grape, raspberry all in one. So if that makes sense, its sweet and sour all at once and in an almost overwhelming fashion. I really love the tartness as it sticks with you the entire time, but its complemented very well by the fruit sweetness. Freaking amazing experience! (4.5)
Mouthfeel: Thinner medium bodied brew with excellent carbonation. It's somewhat resinous and coats my tongue in pure sourness along with the fizzy carbonation. The aftertaste is of course sour, with some sweetness all at the same time. It's a true pleasure to drink. (4.5) 
Overall: I'm amazed at how good this beer is. It disappeared so quickly- it's that easy to drink and appreciate. Smells great, tastes great and overall deserves its reputation as probably the best AWA out there. Sour as hell yet has its sweetness that makes it an incredible sensory experience. If you hate sours, you should still try this beer. If you love sours, chances are you've already had this beer. So I don't know if my review will contribute anything to this site, except to show how much I love drinking this Russian River brew. World class stuff. (4.5) 2,224 charactersStevedore, Apr 24, 2013

pours exactly as the last guy stated...."hazy amber, thin head, minimal lacing"... exactly....
smell is awesome. sour cherry. i really like the sours; love the belgian petrus. this one has the twist of the cherries...
really like the sour taste. but it isnt a 'sipper' as far as i'm concerned. i prefer a full gulp to slosh around inside my mouth and let all my taste buds enjoy.... it is a cherry flavor, and there are other 'berry' flavors seemingly in there and i can definitely drink these continually throughout the evening... but once you get the 'sour' you kind of need to continue with the sour as it throws the flavor off everything else... which is the best reason of all to pop that petrus i've been saving for the last six months....
there's a tingly kind of small-bubble carbonation and overall i really really like this brew. i dont want to abuse the 'straight 5' review and i dont want to be intimidated by the super high price i had to pay to try this brew, but i honestly feel it is worthy of 5s across the panel. for me, as much as i absolutely LOVE the sour beers, this one is a complete winner and as close to nirvana as i plan to ever get; thus, the marks. 1,212 characterspkalix, Apr 23, 2013

WOAH YEAH that is exactly what i want in a sour. a fantastic sour ! lots of wild yeast flavors, very tart cherry.. definitely getting some oak wooden flavor.. holy crap though, it's just a very tart delicious wine-like, champagne-like blend of funkyness mixed in with such a tangy sourness that wrecks your mouth in one shot. i love it. medium body, high carbonation. very sour and tart. 
i can't even come up with words to describe how delicious this is. i will leave it at this: i am fairly new to the world of sours, but was spoiled from day one, having such things as fou foune, la femme fatale, sonderho hipster ale. i've had plenty of other sours since, and they just haven't had that tangy sourness as fou foune.. even the cantillon kriek was good, but not on par with fou foune. THIS, however, supplication is just as acidic and sour.. not as fruity, more vinegary-acidic with cherries and grape flavor.. but still. a completely delicious, cheek wrecking, dimple giving sour beer. 1,151 charactersfacundoCNB, Apr 20, 2013

Yeasty, bready, well balanced with hops and the sublte taste of the wine barrel that it was aged in. Not as good as Pliny, but a very good ale to say the least.

A: A darker reddish brown with an inch of foamy off-white head. Leaves moderate stains on the glass. Bright and clear with carbonation running throughout the body.
N: Lots of wine grape, vinegar, grapefruit sourness, sour cherries, and rhubarb. I'm getting a whisp of the wood and there's a distinctly cheesy funk (think irish cheddar for the saltiness). Has a sour doughiness and a fair amount of wet leather and peppered earth from the pinot noir.
T: Moderately sour with a touch of vinegar and acid over the top of a light, fruited sweetness. There's a touch of salt here which I attribute to the vinegar. Does tend to muddle together a bit. 
M: Very well carbonated and it's very assertive on the mouthfeel. Medium-light body with no alcohol presence.
O: I really want to like this one more than I do. It's got a lot going for it, but in the RR pantheon, I prefer Consecration, and in the grander scheme, for fair comparisons, I'd probably go with a Rodenbach Grand Cru for about half the price. 1,053 charactersSarlacc83, Apr 14, 2013

4.32/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5375 mL bottle poured into a Teku Glass. Bottled on 12/17/12 which is about 3 months ago, as of this review.
Appearance: Pours a medium brown/cherry color and leaves a finger or two of off-white head.
Smell: A good amount of funk, some cherries but not overwhelming; quite sour just from the aroma
Taste: Funk, vinegar, cherries, apple cider. A good amount of sour, but not too much. Some oaky woodiness as a background flavor as well. Tasty.
Mouth-feel: Well carbonated, and the lactic acid/sourness makes it not exactly smooth, but it's not rough going down either. However, what is interesting to me is that this one is nearly 8% alcohol and there is no hint of that.
Overall: Definitely a quality sour. I expected the cherries to come out a bit more than they have, but I think they definitely help this one, and leave it well balanced, especially for the slightly higher ABV for a sour. 895 charactersResuin, Mar 24, 2013

The smell is very deep. Sweet tart cherries, some funk, sugar/ candy. Smells great. Not very potent. 
Tastes wonderful. Tart, but not sour, lots of carbonation, sweet, vinous, acidic and funky but rounded out. I like 312 charactersraynmoon, Mar 23, 2013

A- pours a dark copper with a 3" light tan head. Big trails and patches of lacing remain on the glass.
S- huge vinegar, tart cherries, oak, vinous notes
T- tart cherries, vinegar, vinous notes, oak, earthiness
M- medium body and high carbonation. Huge pop of the cork. Effervescent and dry, with a palate wrecking sour and dry aftertaste.
O- 8/10 sourness, amazing sour! From the nose I expected more cherry but being 4 years old it makes sense the the cherries may have faded. Just enough cherry to balance the vinegar and sourness. 609 characterskawilliams81, Mar 16, 2013

A - Light tan head has an orange tint, tight bubbles. Good clarity from a gentle pour. Amber in color. Minimal lacing left on the glass.
S - Little bit of brett character in the glass that had more sediment. Candied valentines day hearts. Tartness is hard to identify but it's present in the background.
T - Puckering sourness is all over this beer. The fruitiness seems like unrippened cherry/raspberry with a little bit of bitterness to it. The finish is cleaner from a pour that has less sediment in the glass. Little acetobacter/cider vinegar flavor. Small amount of sweetness dries up quickly.
M - Medium to medium-light body, tingly medium carbonation, pretty dry feel. 
O - Enjoyed the complexity in the aroma, many things going on here. Stark contrast to the taste portion. Flavor-wise this beer shows a lot of harder to find dimensions/flavors. Feel was what I would look for to compliment. 968 charactersJparker37, Mar 10, 2013

A - this one pours a nice red burgundy with some nice fuzzy loving at the bottom; the head is rimmed with solid lacing; plenty of funky chunks settled at the bottom
S - I get the cherry right away, with some white grapes, musty oak, and subtle Pinot hints
T - the cherry musty tart thing is what this beer is all about; the grape notes persist as well; there are some lemon hints with some tangy notes...like a liquid version of a sweet and sour
M - the mouth on this one really shines...it's near flawless in the feel; carbonation is perfect, and at 7%, this'll pack a punch while still hitting light and easy; awesome on the mouth
O - I'm still not a huge sour guy, but this beer is top notch; the flavors are light, refreshing, and crisp...while still maintaining complexity. Love the cherries, oak, must, lemon tart elements...awesome beer and at the top in its style! 910 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Feb 28, 2013

A- Pours a vibrant maroon colored, slightly hazy body with a fizzy 1" white head that rises and reduces pretty quickly to leave a tiny white ring. No lacing. Some settling. 
S- I get tart cherries, granny smith apples, white grapes, a musty woodiness, fermented pears, slight funk, and some slight red wine notes. 
T- Wow. This is blowing me out of my chair. Starts off robust and sour with sour cherry, green apple, and vinegar notes, further evaluation reveals a leathery woodyness that really compliments the acidic character of this beer. Wine-like aftertaste, particular a dry astringency that's typical of a dry red wine. 
M- Medium body, crisp and perfectly carbonated. Hard to put down. 
This is quite a beer. I'm honored to have been able to taste one of the best sours out there - and I was highly impressed. It's complex, robust, and balanced. The acidity is not cloying in the least bit and works well with the wine/barrel notes. A must try for all beer advocates. 1,077 charactersgcamparone, Feb 27, 2013

4.95/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I was incredibly spoiled for this to be the first sour beer I ever tried, on New Year's Eve 2012. $12 for a 12 oz bottle, and worth it. Dark red in appearance with incredible champagne-like bubbling that didn't stop. The bubbles felt great without being overpowering. The various yeasts combined to create a not-overpowering sour flavor mostly of cherries and wine grapes with some slight wood flavors from the Pinot barrels. Such an awesome beer. Having now tried a bunch of Russian River sours, this is still my favorite, although Consecration tastes very similar and is somewhat stronger. 591 charactersfalc0n2600, Feb 26, 2013

Appearance: Hazy dark orange/red with creamy white head, great retention and lacing. 
Smell: Sweet tart fruit, a lot of sour cherries, a little of the pinot peeks through nicely. 
Taste: Sweet, tart, cherries, the taste lingers and coats the tongue pleasantly. If the pinot was a little more forward it'd be a 5/5.

Tons of sediment, but that is expected with the amount of yeast added. Smells of funky, sour cherries, oak, vinegar, grapes, lots of funkiness. Lots of dryness that really does give it a wine-like smell. Smells almost like a cherry warhead. Taste starts with a very astringent, dry, sour cherry flavor, as well as some oak and funkiness. Then get some of the brown ale qualities: slight breadiness, maybe some cocoa (but i could just be imagining that), some carmel malt. Then the astringent sour notes from the brett and bacteria come back even stronger, along with lots more cherry, grape, funkiness, vinegar, oak, some carmel. Extremely dry finish that blends the wine and the beer qualities nicely. So sour, yet extremely balanced. High medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Very lively carbonation from the refermentation that does give it a very champagne-like crisp finish. Very complex and so delicious. Just getting into this style, but I have a feeling I won’t come across many sours better than this one. Hope to try this again someday. 1,171 charactersbrewskis, Feb 18, 2013

Batch 008
A: Gorgeous deep amber to burgundy with an off white head of foam which dissipates quickly to a faint cling to the glass.
S: Mostly balsamic vinegar and wood with some tart cherries with touches of sweetness.
T: The base is wood, leather and earth, which loses itself in notes of acetic acid, cherry tartness, green grapes, sprinkles of sea salt, and sour funk from the yeast and bacteria. The pleasant sour bite is the focal point of this brew which is the base for the complexity from the Pinot barrels, cherries, and yeast / bacteria blend. 
M: Medium bodied with a nice syrupy linger that is at the same time smooth with faint carbonation and almost no lace on the glass.
O: The melange of flavors sums to an indescribable concoction that grays the area between beer and wine. The product is a sour ale with flavors that are boldly distinct yet combine together with synergism. A wonderful brew that is a must try for all beer lovers out there. 993 charactersElSid, Feb 13, 2013
4/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter. Label says 082712 
A- Pours a rubyish light brown color with a 1/2 inch tan head that bears little retention time before fizzing away to a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a small patch of surface foam. Non-resilient lacing slides quickly down the glass.
S- Bright fruity nose with some lactic acid sourness. Notes of cherries, grape juice and plum. Slightly effervescent.
T- Semi-heavy sourness plays off the cherry and other fruit notes well with some vinegar in the aftertaste. Not much else going on but there doesn't need to be. Very straightforward.
M- Prickly and crisp with a tartness that causes the mouth to salivate after every sip. Medium-low carbonation is a surprise but doesn't detract from the overall experience. Medium body.
O- Finally starting to truly develop a palate for sours. This one isn't my favorite, but it drinks well and has enough sweetness to balance. 922 charactersImmortale25, Feb 13, 2013

A: Orange to brown in color it has a small tan to brown head that leaves a thick lacing around top of the glass. It is semi translucent but not cloudy, it looks clean and there is some carbonation that can be seen.
S: you can smell the wine from the pino barrels for sure and there is definitely the smell of sour cherries (I only know they are sour cherries because it says so on the bottle) they have a sweetness to them and they become the dominant smell. There is also a little bit of that yeasty funk but you have to really try to smell it. 
T: to start you can definitely taste the pino barrels and other yeasts, but then there is a sweetness that kicks in and mixes with that tart wine flavor. Then the sour starts to kick and you realize that the sweetness was definitely the sour cherries as the cherry flavor is apparent. The finish is that sweetness which is then taken over by the pino and yeasts that leads to that wine/champagne flavor that lasts for a good five seconds.
M: It is smooth and somewhat carbonated with the refermentation process giving it a light champagne like feel. Though the thing that makes this goes down really easily is the fact this thing is super oily, but not overwhelming. 
O: I continue to be extremely impressed with russian river sours I would go as far as to say I love this beer it is delicious, has so much depth and so many flavors. It pretty much has everything as advertised cherries pino and yeast/sour taste, I can't think of how to improve it. Its not the best beer I've ever had, but its definitely up there I highly recommend this beer. 1,622 charactersPinknuggets, Feb 13, 2013
4.38/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes. I have had the pleasure of drinking this beer many times, but have never been in a situation in which I could mull over a review. Fortunately I brought back a bottle recently and had the opportunity to do so.
375 ml bottle, bottle date 04/11/2013. Poured into a HF tulip.
A. Deep amber. Not a classic yellow amber, but rather an opaque brown. I imagine this is what some 100 million year old insect amber looks like. The beer possesses some light carbonation, and forms a small tan head which quickly recedes, leaving a hazy lacing.
O. Tart and lactic. Sour but not bitingly so. There is a cherry sweetness that really comes through here. The oak lingers in the nose, and really starts to take over as the beer settles.
T. The cherry shines up front, with some breadyness complementing it. There is a pleasant sourness all the way through, and a tart oaken flavor dominates at the end. The wood is present here through and through. Very exciting.
M. This beer is almost wine like, especially as the carbonation gives away. That said, it's more medium bodied, not like a heavy red wine or anything, and the alcohol is well hidden.
O. This is a marvelously drinkable beer, and a classic American wild ale. One of my favorite "readily available" sours. The balance of tart, sweet, and oak in this brew is superb, especially when fresh. The mouthfeel is lacking a bit, and I wish there was a bit more carbonation in the bottling of this beer. Otherwise it's fantastic. 1,491 charactersTychoNDC, Feb 12, 2013

A: Golden amber. Not much head and no real lacing to speak of.
S: Sourdough bread, and raspberry.
T: Flavor follows suit.... bready, raspberry and fermented cherry. A little alkaline
M: Slightly bitter with a dry finish.
D: Enjoy....
Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice appearance although not much in terms of head or lacing. Nose is a basic but a strong fruity bready combo. Flavor is fruity, but only a little sweet, white bready. Overall, this is a great quaff. 510 charactersbmwats, Feb 10, 2013

Poured in a standard tulip glass.
Appearance: (4.75)
Pours a hazy light amber/orange with lovely peach highlights throughout the body. A small, finger tall, off white cap of a head quickly forms and falls leaving no lacing behind. Which is to be expected of a barrel aged sour ale. The body is gorgeous.
Aroma: (4.75)
A blast of tart cherries up front, which are positively drenched in some lovely barnyard funk; Musty, dusty hay, leather, light tobacco. The initial blast of cherry seems to be a byproduct of lactobacillus, which are one of the souring bacteria that Russian River(as well as most other sour ale producers) uses in this beer, but underneath the tart and funk is a fabulous aroma that you can only get from fresh cherries. The cherries really add a great, fresh contrast to dusty Brettanomyces in the nose. The aroma is bathed in a thick barrel character from the Pinot Noir barrels; mostly vanilla and slight, earthy pepperiness. A faint, malty sweetness lingers in the background. 
Taste: (4.75)
Bright, juicy and sour lemon attacks your palate immediately with ripe, tart cherry skins soon to follow. Like the nose, the aggressive sourness is clothed in this musty, dusty barnyard funkiness. Middle of the mouth is when the fresh cherries really come out to play in conjunction with lightly bready malt backbone. The beer finishes VERY dry and sour with lingering notes of sour cherries, bitter lemon peel and a light tannin presence. The barrel comes out more and more as the beer starts to warm; notes of vanilla, cherries and a generic pepperiness. 
Mouthfeel: (4.75)
Fully bodied with an interesting creaminess. High carbonation. 
Overall: (4.75)
This doesn't become the highest ranked 'American Wild Ale' on Beeradvocate.com without good reason. This beer is absolutely awesome and extremely ahead of its time(for American Craft Beer) when it first came out in the early 2000's. This beer is awesome, and do to it's extreme sourness, I can only recommend it to seasoned sour fanatics. 2,033 charactersflayedandskinned, Feb 07, 2013

S-When initially served, it was a bit too cold and the aroma was stunted. However, as it warmed I really was impressed. A triad of wine, ale and sour yeast. The tart cherries are eccentric and enticing. The distinct Pinot Noir aroma rises and strengthens as the glass warms. Musty, dusty and oaky. The base ale also lends some pleasant malted aromas as well.
T-The flavor wowed me as well. The initial tartness of the yeast and cherries stunned my palate. As my tongue became accustomed to the flavors, I was able to pick up the delectable offerings of the barrel-aging process. Supplication is vinous and bretty while also staying sweet and ripe. I love the must, dust and oak that is found both in flavor and aroma. Perfect level of sourness.
M-Lighter side of medium bodied. Whizzing carbonation. Off-dry. No hints of alcohol. Supplication drinks with epic ease. I licked my lips and they even tasted tart.
O/D-What a success. One of the best Sours I have come across. Deserves its nearly godly reputation. This could turn any wine lover into a beer lover with one quick sip. 1,258 charactersVelvetExtract, Feb 04, 2013

A - Color is a burnt orange somewhat carmel-y colored. Poured a little cold, about 2 inches of foam rises from a down the middle pour and dissipates quickly. Quite a few strings of champagne looking bubbles rise through the glass.
S - Smells awesome. Lots of dry wood, some fruit-y type character that I cant quite pint point. This is one of the first beers I've tried (admittedly not a lot sours) where I get that funky barnyardy type smell. (at least I think thats what it is) just a slight funky-ness to it. Not offputting, really great in fact.
T - First sip is a kick in the teeth of sourness. Lots of tart dark cherry. Some sweet apple cider vinegar type notes as it warms up. Oak. Clean and crisp sour finish on the end.
M - Nice level of carbonation for the medium its working in. Some nice bubbly carbonation. Nice light-medium thickness.
O - This is a really great sour beer. On the sour side of balanced, I think lots of people could enjoy this, as it really plays all the bases well. I'm interested to see what its like after some time in the cellar. 1,082 charactersBeerandboards, Jan 25, 2013

A: the pour is an awesome amber mixed with ruby hints (moderate transparency). i got about 1/2 fingers worth of head formation on a semi aggressive pour, but it was so carbonated (like cola) that it quickly dissipatated
S: the aroma just spews out during the pour. immediately, i get huge aromas of sour and tart cherries, vinegar, and funky yeasts. there is an aweome wood character in the backbone that holds this brew together. its just an awesome aromatic brew to be honest
T: damn! this brew is simply delicious. there is such an aweome balance betwen the wine/barrel characteristics and the sourness, it is truly hard to describe. there is big tart fruitness in the body, that is well balanced with vingear. i get some funkiness but its so well intergrated into the beer!
M: with each and every sip, the salivary glands freak out. highly carbonated, and on a lighter side of medium bodied. it leaves a delightful tartness yet alcohol-heatness on the palate that consistently provides salivation.
O: this is a brew that I honestly wish I had access to everyday. It is truly phenomenal, and something that I will consistenly seek out. My only wish was that it was bottled in 750ml bottles. i want more!!!
Again, thank you so much matttYCE and beachstrength49 for this brew! you guys are awesome! 1,371 characterstut2528, Jan 21, 2013

Freshness: Batch 082712
Packaging: 375ml brown bottle, corked and caged
Glassware: Teku
Purchased: Mail order
Appearance is a clear, burgundy color (very pretty) with a thin white head that dissipates quickly and leaves little in the way of lacing. Subsequent pour shows some yeast cloudiness.
Aromas are strong and very wine-like, of the red grape variety, plus cherries. Smells suggest a dry and sour beer, with woody and tannin characteristics.
The taste is a shock in a sense, due to the sharp sourness, more so than Temptation I had earlier tonight. Sour fruit (cherries), plus wood/oak notes and funk. The dark grapes lend an acidic quality as well.
Mouthfeel has a very high carbonation level on a medium body. The beer finishes super dry and sour, with some red wine acidity as well.
Overall, this wild ale has some similarities to the Temptation, but is more sour and has flavors of red grapes/wine vs. the white. The aromas and taste are stronger/bolder and more sour here. An Outstanding beer 1,030 characterssommersb, Jan 19, 2013

A - Pours a clear dark ruby body. Lots of rising carbonation and one finger of off white foam. Minimal lacing and retention.
S - Cherries, oak, vanilla, red wine, and some tart vinegar. Quite nice.
T - Tart cherries and oak. A bit of vinegar and moldy cheese with a long sour finish. Not very well balanced and a bit harsh. Aftertaste is clean with a lasting acetic bite. Not quite at the level of a flanders our bruin. Super sour and just a bit jumbled when it comes to the flavors 
M - Crisp and lively, medium bodied. 
O - Super sour with a nice cherry presence, but this one did not live up to the hype for me. Glad to have had the chance to try it though. 764 charactersdavey101, Jan 19, 2013

The beer pours a very nice burgundy color, hues of medium amber, orange and ruby, a touch of fizzy off-white head rises out of the glass but dissipates instantaneously leaving no lacing. It's fairly clear, a touch of haze, lots of bubbles rising to the top of the glass, certainly looks to be a lively beer. The aroma is very intense, strong cherry presence with a nice amount of red wine behind it, earthy wood and funk with some mild vinegar also leap out of the glass. The flavors are simply wonderful, especially as the beer warms and decants, nice juicy cherry, tanin heavy red grape that brings out a bit of a leathery flavor as well from the barrel. The oak flavors really come to form on the tongue, smooth, a bit sweet and just a touch chewy, a bit of tobacco comes through with the wood as well that quickly gets faded out by an assertive but not dominating vinegar presence that brings out the acidity in these flavors, balancing out the earthiness a bit. The body is very lively, high levels of carbonation, prickly on the tongue and as it goes down with a nice dry finish.
Verdict: A truly world class Wild Ale. One of the more complex beers on the market and one of the finest examples of what a sour beer can become. Everything is in harmony with each sip, a beer everyone must try. 1,416 characterskevanb, Jan 13, 2013

From the get go this beer is impressive. After popping the cork you see a beautiful deep amber cherry color, with a nice creamy pinkish-white head, and as the bubbles rise, the sediment cascades downward like a snowglobe. 
On the nose I get the soft, yet complex smell of pinot as well as acidic cherry.
The first drink is sure to shock the palate a bit, however thereafter they are received much easier.
The taste is briefly a soft fruit flavor with lemon, followed by the tart punch from the brettanomyces in which you get several flavor profiles of bitter, acidic and sour cherry, and it then begins to fade abruptly into an impressively long and complex after taste that has a floral essence and leaves an oaky mouth feel that ties the whole thing together quick wonderfully.
Overall this was very great well crafted and enjoyable beer. 
I guess if I were to find a negative it would be in the price, while I fully expect a barrel aged beer of this quality to cost a bit more, I still felt this was at least $2-$3 dollars over priced for such a small quantity. 
But then again maybe not. 1,140 characterscaseyscarb, Jan 11, 2013

A: amber hued. slightly hazed. carbonization bubbles everywhere, carefully making their way to the surface. head is a reddish white hue and tightly bubbled. retention is solid. some lacing.
S: acidic. tart. sour cherries. floral. there is a mild chocolate aroma in there too. dry hot chocolate powder. however, mostly barny and beautiful. the cherries add a nice layer of depth. 
T: wow, that is sour and then some. after the initial slam, my palate adjusts to the flavor. vinous. sour cherries impart a sweetness as well. reminds me of a cherry pie pastry. hard to discern between the super sweet flavor and the acidic tartness. the finish has a meaty graininess to it. lingering pie crust. 
M: carbonation is spot on. bubbly, but not too much to distract from the body. medium bodied. 
D: super solid brew. understandable why it is becoming the benchmark for American wilds. great complexity and balance. glad to see the grain peek its head out from a blanket of acidity. if you have the ability to get this, get it. 1,069 charactersJimmys, Jan 05, 2013

The head is a light tan color, creamy, and less than a finher high. It sits atop a clear red amber colored liquid. Retention is light, but otherwise favorable appearance. The aroma is Pinot Noir woodiness, sharp tart cherries, vinegar, sweet and sour/lemon juice, hints at vanilla pleasantly. The taste matches the aroma and then some. Plenty of vinegar, tart cherries, lemon bite, with plenty of Pinot Noir and oaky characteristics, and more undertones of vanilla. Finishes with a mix of sharp sour, oak/vinous, and subdued tart notes. The mouthfeel is light and almost bubbly but not quite. Medium-round carbonation, velvety smooth consistency, and a medium body.
Overall my expectations were high (probably because it's Russian River) but once again they were exceeded greatly. I've now had almost all the RR sours/wilds now and while they differ in certain aspects they have all been nothing short of fantastic. It's like they have different sours to fit your different moods, much like there are types of wines (and the barrels they age these in). Is there a better brewery for this many quality American Wild Ales in the country? I think not. 1,222 charactersmatttttYCE, Dec 29, 2012

4.78/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5Poured into a wine glass from a 375ml bottle. Label states it was bottled on "08/27/12."
What a beautiful color this is! Reminds me very vividly of the Cantillon kriek I got to luckily try when I lived in Europe. Because it's a brown ale rather than traditionally a wheat ale, there's a darkened overtone that surrounds the reddish-plumb color. Reflected in the light, delightful amber orange shades reveal themselves. Tiny bubbles of carbonation rise in droves at the sides of the glass, but this is as clear as these Lambic-style beers can get. Jewel-like in appearance, and even with yeast added in, any cloudiness it gains gives it the appearance of an aged, refined beer. Perfection.
The smell is quite tart - not as much as actual Lambics I've had before, but often reminiscing them in full form. The Brettanomyces phenols are not as overpowering as I'd expect, yet at the same time the elements seem to come together in full form here. The woodiness from the Pinot Noir barrels come in droves, but the lemon rind and apple/pear/cherry tart achieved by the Brett strands and cherries are wholly fantastic. It may not be overpoweringly tart overall, but there's barely anything here that resembles beer, which is always a fascinating experience.
The flavor is spot on to tart-like sours, and every sip brings me back to my favorite takes on the beer style. The initial taste is consists of citrus, slight wine-like fruity characteristics, as well as a smooth yet flavorful cherry finish. The sour tart finish is awesome, and the yeast seems to crawl all over the palate with each gulp. The alcohol becomes finally a bit present here, and adds sweetness, but it is the sour flavors that win here completely. The beer is characteristically dry, but the the finish is refreshing in part of the fruits and yeasty finish.
What a beautiful concoction that Russian River has once again delivered. Words cannot recommend this more. It's really complex, but all the flavors meld together that it is really balanced. It's not too yeasty yet nicely sour, not too malty yet quite thickened, not too fruity yet deliciously tart overall. Will be trying more of these wild ales from RR in future for sure. 2,199 charactersmagictacosinus, Dec 28, 2012

Appearance: Deep bourbon-y brown with a nice tan head
Nose: Cherry candies, tart cranberry juice, sweet caramel, and toasty oak. Really nice combination of aromas.
Taste: Cherry forward, with the caramel and oak underneath. Some of the tart cranberry and strawberry from the Pinot Noir barrels are evident. Complex and a nice balance of tart and sweet.
Mouthfeel: Medium with a hint of tannic dryness. 
Overall: The cherries get to be a bit much when it warms up but sipping it slowly reveals a complex combination of tasty flavors and aromas. 593 charactersfdig23, Dec 20, 2012

FUNK, Pinot, dry grassiness, puckingly sour but not overly so. Acidic. I've had Beatification and I'm not sure it's better, just different. They are equally as good. One is just rarer than the other.
I've had a decent amount of Belgian examples of the style and this trumphs most but weird as it may be, I prefer this to most Krieks. Also, let it be known I've never had a Cantillon Beer so please take this fact into account...
Everything I look for in a sour with cherries added is right freaking here.
Dry, and semi grassy finish allows for this one to be more drinkabe than any other representation of the style I've had but that doesn't neccessarily mean best.
Near perfect beer. Well Done RRBC. 740 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Dec 20, 2012

A: Poured into a wine glass. Beaten copper color with minimal head and minimal lacing. First appearance is hazy, but that is actually extremely fine carbonation rising to the surface. Tiniest little bubbles ever. 
S: Cherries, sour mash, lactobacillus funk, candied red fruit, barnyard, straw. 
T: Barnyard funk, musty beginning, acidic, wine like, tart bright cherry candy finish (think cherry Jolly Rancher). Flavor sticks with you.
M: Big acidity. Absolutely massive flavor for being light to medium bodied. Carbonation works wonders to bring everything together. 
O: The mountain top of sours. Extremely high quality, very flavorful without being a "big" beer. One of the paragons of the style. 723 charactersMcStagger, Dec 18, 2012

A- Pours a translucent ruby red with a thin white cap that leaves no lacing behind.

T- The taste is toned down a bit with vinegar, freshly pressed cherries, vanilla, red grapes, lemon, brett, juice and some sweet tarts.
M- Medium carbonation with a crisp dry finish.
O- A really well done sour that has a nice balance of tartness, fruitiness and funkiness that isn't too mouth puckering. Would love to have a couple more bottles of this and see how it develops. 610 charactersiadler, Dec 13, 2012

At my local brew store, I saw Supplication - and knew it came highly recommended. While I've got some work to do on my glassware game, this was served from a bottle poured into a pint glass.
A- a beautiful burnt orange, like a Colorado sunset - when the sky looks like its on fire. Deep, rich hues that invoke memories of world travel and freedom. Carbonation bubbles constantly float upwards, in a seemingly endless fashion.
S - Wow. Cherries, Sour, smells like winter and spring at the same time. Refreshingly in your face, but the tartness of the ale really comes through your nostrils.
T - A beautifully put-together sour ale. So complex, with flavors galore. Not overpowering, not too tart, very very well done.
M - my mouth is still watering.

Smell - Sweet cherries and a touch of wood smell. Definitely picking up the wild yeasts as well
Taste - Puckering wild tartness, this one takes you for a ride. The sweet rich cherries dance around your mouth as the wild yeasts make tartness abundant. It bites at your tongue all the way down and leaves a wheat like yeast flavor to linger for just a second before being taken back over by the cherries again and leaves your mouth salivating for more. Great stuff
Mouthfeel - Very carbonated and fairly thin but right in line with a sour
Overall - This is one of the best sours I have ever had and once again Russian River hits a home run on sours. I for one will always look to try any sour beer that Vinnie and the team put out as they are always fantastic. My hats off once again 850 charactersWiscoBrewsco, Dec 11, 2012

A: Dark amber; fairly fluffy, off-white head.
S: Earthy / barrel-y notes, but some sharp fruit notes cut through them.
T: Medium sourness (though I'm sure it would be rated as fairly intense by novice sour beer drinkers). Dark fruit flavors; not too similar to real krieks, in that regard... Cherry flavor is there, but so are plums. Barrel-aging provides a more earthy kind of wood flavor, rather than the usual strong vanilla notes.
M: The carbonation seems to disperse quickly, providing a very smooth, soft mouthfeel. The alcohol content (albeit not too high) provides a medium-heady body.
O: A balanced and complex sour beer. Along with Temptation and Consecration, it's one of the better Russian River beers (but pales in comparison to Beatification). Just don't compare it to a kriek... it doesn't taste like one, being much darker and heavier. 899 charactersshleepy, Dec 10, 2012

Appearance – Reddish/brown with glowing orange highlights. Deep red-orange glow when held to the light; dark honey. Slightly cloudy from visible yeast particles; 1 finger white head dissipates quickly to a lasting ring of thin foam with nearly no lacing. Very active carbonation.
Smell – I was hit with the sour aroma as soon as I uncorked the bottle! The smell starts with a sour fruitiness from the cherries which gives way, as I soon detect some fairly strong oak that is almost buttery (if that makes sense).
Taste – Taste follows the nose, starting with sour black cherries. The oak comes in at the back end, with distinct vanilla overtones. Very nice. It finished dry with some more, extra tart fruit, making me want another sip.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability – A fair amount of carbonation on the tongue, putting this beer at the very thin side of medium bodied. The sourness is there in a big way, but not overpowering, playing a huge role in this beer's drinkablitly.
Overall – An awesome beer that is complex, but not overly so, and very tasty. I only wish I had another bottle! 1,145 charactersTheFightingMongooses, Dec 03, 2012
4.14/5  rDev -8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On-tap at Monks for $5 during Zwanze Day 2012.
Pours a a hazy, dark amber/light brown color with little-to-no head and some spotty lacing.
Aroma begin quite sweet and tart. Initially you get the Brett with a little bit more sweet on the nose though then some of the recent sours I have had. Cherries and other tart fruitiness become more apparent as it warms close to room temperature. Funky yeast continues to evolve more with some light woody aromas as well now as it gets a little warmer; this was turning out to be very nice indeed.
The taste begins with the funkified Brett tartness with a surprisingly substantial pilsner malty sweetness. Deep sour tastes join the party, but not as much as I was expecting. Maybe this is still too "young". Nice notes of dark cherry throughout. As it warms you get some more cherry sweetness with some nice tones of wood mixed in throughout.
The mouthfeel is average with appropriate carbonation for the style. Brett and traditional yeast really help this to finish quite dry with a nice lingering taste of sour Brett. It came off a little bit fuller then some of the other sours I have had, with more of a rich feel despite the loads of carbonation.
Overall this is a really great sour beer. I don't believe it is the best I have had by far but I cannot deny the extremely high drinkability this possesses. Normally I do not seek out this beer because of the high price tag and "average" flavor profile for a sour but for $5 on draft, I'll take that everyday of the week and 2x on Zwanze Day. 1,538 charactersclaspada, Dec 02, 2012

Lots of oak on the nose with hints of sour cherry but nothing overpowering. There’s also a bit of red wine and some funkiness, but not that much really. Over ripe cherries start the palate off and then there’s a nice funky, wood middle with a solid sour finish that doesn’t last quite as long as I’d like. 403 charactersjbaker67, Dec 02, 2012

Smells like a mixed box of cherry clan and lemonheads. 
Taste characteristics follow the nose. Quite tart of front but very cell balanced with nice flavor. Very well balanced with tart up front transitioning into a mild fruity sweetness. 
Mouth is effervescent, light bodied with high carb and a fairly dry finish. 
Overall this is one of my favorite RR and/or sours. Well balanced. Better than Beatification IMO. 531 charactersMrVonzipper, Nov 08, 2012

A - deep, much deeper than I would expect. Brown, almost like a brown ale. I know the bottle identifies this beer as a brown ale, but I find that hard to believe, considering the smell and taste. This is actually my first sour/wild ale since I started drinking crafts. Quite a bit of head, considering the carbonation.
S - super vinegary. A lot of sour emanating from the glass, but also the sweetness you'd expect from a fruity beer. 
T - I taste a lot of the carbonation here; plenty of fruit, but mostly the bitterer aspects of the sweetness, if that makes sense. Almost tastes like a soda.
M - despite the overwhelming carbonation, I like the mouthfeel. There's hardly any indication of the alcohol here.
O - this beer might not be worth the price tag, but it's definitely solid. I'm going to attempt to age a couple of bottles. 915 charactersJamesShoemaker, Nov 07, 2012

M: Slightly light carbonation. Quite velvety. Quite dry also.
O: A well done sour ale through its woody, slightly vinous aspect. Quite sober all the same. 516 charactersFux, Nov 05, 2012

Crystal clear brown pour with ruby highlights. Half finger fizzy snow white head. Lacing is spotty.
Brown sugar, sweet and tart cherries, vanilla, subtle wine notes. Slight acidity, oak notes are subtle and add a wonderful depth too it. Very nice candy aroma.
The sour from the base beer is not over the top, slightly sweet. Throw it in with cherries in a wine barrel and you get a sweet and tart masterpiece with wine and cherry notes fighting for supremacy. Brown sugar, vanilla, oak, red wine and a slight Brett presence. Lingering finish.
High carbonation, light body, slightly sticky on the lips 636 characterskorguy123, Nov 01, 2012
4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: A pale copper with excellent clarity, which surprised me after wresting the cork as much as I did I was sure I'd have stir up the sediment. The off-white head with a touch of pink/orange is quick to fade leaving a ring of fine bubbles around the edge of the glass. 
S: An intense sour aroma with moderately-strong fruit aromas mostly of black cherries and currents. There is some of that velvety red grape aroma layered on top of the vanilla and oak notes. Nothing in the way of malt or hops aroma; no diacetyl either.
T: Lots of fruit most red currents and oranges with a moderately-strong sourness. There is a little bit sweetness but the balance is pretty tart, like a sweet tart with twice the tart. There aren't any hops to be found here either but there not needed; very low bitterness and no flavor. The finish is very dry, there is a tartness left in the aftertaste but its mostly fruity with oranges, dark cherries and even a touch of strawberries. 
M: moderately-light bodied with moderate carbonation. It's not cream nor crisp. No astringency.
O: Wow! A complex, fruity sour with a whole lot of balance. Well worth getting a hold of. This beer could easily substitute for light to moderate red wine when paired with food. There a quiet a few beers with more sour than this but Supplication has elegant refined flavor, I want nothing more out this beer than say a few more bottles. 1,398 charactersMadScientist, Nov 01, 2012

Browned red, witha finger and change of eggshell head. Moderate retention and good lacing. Nose has oak, cherries, light acetic, mild vinous character, and some underlying sweet malt predominantly masked by the acid. Some underripe apple as well. Taste has sweet oak and malt character initially, and opens up immediately into really juicy cherries, acid and finishes with a subtle pucker. More acidic than directly tart/sour. Shred of alcohol.Mediumhigh carbonation, slight spritz in the conclusion. Complex and fantastically delicious, has all of the qualities I love in a sour. 634 charactersliamt07, Oct 26, 2012

Appearance: Deep amber/ruby/almost reddish brown. See a lot of carbonation with a decent head. Head eventually recedes to an 1/8 head. 
Smell: Cherries, yeast. Not impressed by the smell or appearance honestly.
Taste: This is where it gets better. Tartness hits you immediately. Immediate cherries into some sweet and sour apple. You can taste the wine from the wine barrels. It all works really well. Love the complexity. 
Mouthfeel: The carbonation initially intimidated me but it all works really well. Medium bodied.
Overall: Not for the faint of heart. Wouldn't recommend this for someone's first sour. At the same time, I love the pinot barrel taste and the complexities. Not necessarily the best sour I've ever had but I would certainly recommend. Don't get why so many find this one "world class"...had many European sours that trump this one. Either way, I woould love to try this one on tap to see if I spot anything else. Good stuff. 1,003 charactersMagicJeff, Oct 22, 2012

Just getting into sours and my buddy brought me one of these back.
Pours rich amber, almost reddish with fluffy white head that stuck around. Good retention.
Great smell. Tart, cherries, oak, and some good funk. Hints of oak as it warms a little.
Flavor was off that charts. Super tart up front, hits the back of the teeth aggressively, then it smooths out. Cherries, some lemon, Brett funk, all kinds of stuff going on.
Good carbonation that keeps all the complexity and flavors slightly at bay. Balances on the tongue.
Overall? One of the best beers I've ever had. Sours might be my new favorite thing. Not sure any will ever beat Supplication though 676 charactersMaddmartagan, Oct 19, 2012

Bottle from batch 10, poured into a snifter
pours a very dark reddish brown with a half finger of head which has receded quickly leaving a thin ring of foam. good lacing along the sides, thick and consistent 
smells strongly of sour cherries, tart apple, pinot noir and the oak from the barrels, alcohol, a bit of citrus and some bready yeast 
taste is incredibly sour cherry, wine, apples, following through with a nice malty finish. incredible 
the mouth is my favorite part. the flavors come in layers, the first one hitting you being sweet cherry apple, quickly changing from a sweet to neutral, and finally to a strong sour finish leaving a great after taste of cherry, grape, apple, and a trace of malt. Finishes very dry and waits until the very end to make your face twist. Leaves a nice tingle on the tongue, very reminiscent of a good champagne
Overall the best sour I've had. This is the first of my russian river sours, and definitely going to make it challenging to continue aging my other RR sours in my cellar.

4/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From a 375 ml bottle (Batch 10) into a tulip.
A-The beer poured a brownish red color that was mostly clear except for the few floaties that dribbled out of the bottle towards the end. The khaki-colored head was pretty solid and left a nice cap.
S-A pleasant, if not complex, smell of red fruit and berries. I thought of sour cherries and cranberries. There was a bit of oak noticeable.
T-The taste mostly follows the smell, sour cherries and tart cranberries. I also picked up some tart lemon (it may have just been the tartness I was noticing ) and a nice oaky undertone to it all. 
M-There was a nice, prickly carbonation. The long finish left my mouth watering, but it wasn't all sour, there was a just a bit of sweetness.
O-A good sour brew, but not my favorite Russian River. The beer was concentrated and had a good flavor (if you like sour cherry), but a bit one-dimensional to be truly world-class. Perhaps I had too high of expectations, but I thought this one lacked a little of the complexity (oak, vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, etc.) that I was hoping for.
Edit: I recently opened a bottle from Batch 11 and was pleasantly surprised. I found much more oak and tart, vinous complexity than my review above indicates. Tasty. 1,241 charactersspoony, Oct 18, 2012

Appearance - clear amber with a tiny head that dissipates quickly
Smell - sour, dry cherries
Taste - It's sweet but doesn't have any kind of bitter or sour after taste, which is a pleasant surprise. After you get into it a little bit and let it breathe it becomes much more drinkable. 
Mouthfeel - light carbonation, tiny bite. Pleasant. 
I'm surprised how much I enjoy this after being so-so on the Tempation. Hats of to Russian River. 618 charactersjimilayne, Oct 13, 2012

S: Intense lactic and acetic sourness with faint sour cherry in the background. The lactic and acetic nature is balanced, but a bit over the top. Not much else.
T: The sourness is toned down from the aroma, but it's still pretty strong. The sour cherry is very faint in the flavor. There honestly isn't a whole lot going on in this beer.
M: Medium mouthfeel with faint carbonation.
O: Not great - I don't really understand the praise for this beer. It's not terrible, but it reminds me of everything I don't like about AWAs. Overly sour with little complexity. 694 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Sep 30, 2012

This beer poured a cloudy reddish-brown color with lots of active carbonation. The head was one finger and pure white and lingered around for awhile, although it didn’t leave much lacing on the glass. On the nose, there was a definite presence of cherries and funk. Minor notes on the nose included oak and a bit of red wine. Complexity much? On the first sip, the first thing I think is that this beer is crazy tart. It took me a few sips to get used to that. It also didn’t have as much funk as I thought it would. After I got used to that, there was definitely oak and cherries in the taste. The carbonation is definitely active and goes well with the brew, which is much lighter than I thought it would be. This brew almost reminds me of a red wine, which also could be because it was aged in Pinot Noir barrels. The finish lingers with tart cherries. Although this would not be a beer I could have every night, the complexity really makes it an amazing beer. I would have this again in a second. 1,144 charactersmgironta, Sep 17, 2012
4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours copper hued than brown with a very good head and lace. The aroma has big funk and cherry notes with some earthy and dusty character, light notes of caramel and bready malts as well. The taste starts with tart cherries, soft oak undertone, and biting brett nature. The Pinot Noir does show, but only at the finish, along with some subdued spice. Bright and dry mouthfeel, very lambic in nature. Did not expect the sparkling texture from how she looked in the glass. Gorgeous. 480 charactersstoutluvr420, Sep 17, 2012

A - Resembles a darker Felmish red ale as it is a dark reddish brown. Has a glow about it that almost makes it resemble a spirit. Small head head slowly went down to just a layer of foam on the sides.
S - Tart cherries, sweet sugar, oak lemon, red wine tannins, and a slight Brett funk. 
T - Cherry, slight Brett funkiness up front. As it moves on, there is lemon, slight orange peel, wheat grass, oak, red wine tannins. There is a slight sugary sweetness as well that keeps it nicely balanced from being too tart. Well-balanced and complex as each sip brings a slightly different experience.
MF - Nicely, medium carbonated. Slightly thick body with a slight stickiness. The carbonation helps bring the tart flavors that leave a tingle in the tongue. There is a slight astringency that hangs on in the finish. 
O - Probably the most complex of the Russian River sours that I've had. Each sip brings something new as it is tart, sweet and funky all in one beer. 1,016 charactersjeonseh, Sep 16, 2012

The draft is better as expected. The bottle was priced exorbitant and was not as good. The 2012 experience was like a bowl full of cherries with a sweet tart finish that was reminiscent of sweet tarts. The bottle version was less sweet with a somewhat funky sour taste although still enjoyable. The 2016 version was mostly sour with far less cherry flavor and color. Typical of a craft beer, as time progresses the brewers cut corners to increase profits and cash in on the beer's reputation. 582 characterswattoclone, Sep 12, 2012

S- Tart with prominent cherry flavors. Smells a lot like a Flemish Red. Definite sour scents mix in with a slight oak profile. Hints of malt and Belgian yeast bready/earthiness mix in.
T- Moderate levels of sour right off the bat. Big fruit profiles, mostly cherry, but hints of citrus acidity. Hints of the oak peek in right after the sour flavor. Ends fairly dry and with lingering grain tastes. Almost a bread flavor there in the end. Definitely one of the most complex sours I've had.
M- Light, highly carbonated, and hides the alcohol. Almost a champagne-like consistency. Would love to session this one, but after about 2, your palate would not be getting all of the flavors.
Overall, another sour that I love. Definitely world class, and after having PtE and Supplication, I'm really looking forward to Consecration. 968 charactersboilermakerbrew, Sep 08, 2012

Pours a cloudy orange with a very nice nose buttered waffles, oak, spices, almost whiskey barrel notes instead of wine barrels. Taste is a powerful lacto/pedo sourness that sits in the back of the throat. Not too much else. I was really unimpressed. Will need to try this a few more times. 
375mL Batch 4 courtesy of ajm. Pours a cloudy blood orange with a towering, rocky, tan head that leaves insane lacing. Aroma of cotton candy, lacto, sour cherries, baked cherry pie. I’m still not too keen on the taste here. The body is thin and spritzy. And there is a massive oak dryness, tannin, leather quality that distracts from the cherry and sour elements. It’s damn good, but I would take Beatification, Consecration, or Temptation over this any day. 3/22/2010 9/5/7/4/14=3.9 836 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

Good tart mixed berry notes, hints of apple, oak, very small amount of funk. Finishes with pleasant vinegar and red wine notes, which help out the very dry, wine-like finish. Perfectly blended.

Pours cloudy reddish amber with a decent off-white head that leaves very little lacing and recedes to a wispy cap and foamy ring.
Aroma is sour cherries, vinegar, oak, some funk, a bit vinous. Excellent strength.
Flavor starts nice and sour with a lot of cherry notes, dark fruit, apples, oak, vanilla, vinous, a hint of funk but more fruity and sour than anything. A bit of sweetness develops mid-palate but finishes mostly tart and sour. Sourness tapers off the longer it sits in the glass. Minimal alcohol, lingering finish.
Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied, a bit oily and sticky, sharp carbonation bite on the tongue.
Certainly very excited to try this little treat here, and while it was pricey, it was worth it for having a chance to experience this excellent Sour. I’ve only recently begun to dabble in the style and this is one of the best I’ve had so far. 958 characterselgiacomo, Aug 29, 2012

A: Medium Amber with a finger width head that has kind of an off-white color. Lots of sediment from the yeast or something dancing around in it.
S: Sour and intense with a little bit of cherry.
T: One of the most intense tasting beers I've ever had! Sour sour sour!!! with a good amount of sweetness too, not to bitter. Very much tastes like a pinot noire. If anything this is more like a wine than a beer in my opinion. There is some cherry in there too. Very delicious!

Pours an amber with reddish tones. Large fluffy creme head with heavy retention.
Smells immediately of the Pinot noir treatment, signature RR sour bright tart, candied cherries
Sweet taste, bright tartness, cherries really coming through with the Pinot coming through at the end. The cherry taste seemed to change from the candied cherries in the smell to more of a dark cherry.
Mouthfeel is great, medium body with medium carbonation.

A - Head of about a finger quickly dissolves to nothing. Thought I saw a nice light reddish brown color before it went away. Body is very clear and a dark apple juice color. Slight reddishness to it.
S - It has that absolute tart aroma to it, but you can tell there is something in there to balance it out. Apples, cherries, and grapefruit. Tartness of a lemon. Only a slight funkiness to it.
T - Just about the same as the nose except maybe a little more funk. It's all the mostly balanced beer I have had though. Just the right amount of sour and sweet and funk to be wonderful. Again some nice red apple, raspberry, and lime/lime rind.
M - Very drying, light bodied and nice carbonation. Probably my one complaint about this beer.
O - A delight to drink, just a little on the pricey side. 840 charactersRuckusDu, Aug 23, 2012

Pour: Deep copper with two fingers of off white head.
Smell: Tart cherries to the max with a great hay musk.
Taste: Tart cherries and some sour apples too. Sour maltiness on the finish. Vinous flavors lended from the pinot noir barrel aging. Equally pleasant woody characteristics. 
Mouthfeel: Really nice tartness that isn't overpowering. Carbonation is really fantastic. An interesting dynamic between the dryness and the tartness. The crisp dry body encourages you to keep drinking, but the tart finish that lingers on the palates demands that you slow down to enjoy this beer because your palate will become too coated with tart cherries.

Pours a clear reddish brown with a medium white head. Smell is top-notch: red wine, cherries, oak and lactic sourness all are in there and combine together quite nicely and make my mouth water. Flavor follows the nose almost exactly, red wine and oak stand out at first, then we get a little bit of the sweet cherries in the middle before a blast of sourness hits on the back end. It's really quite complex and excellent. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with really nice carbonation with a great mouth-coating bite. Overall, this really proves that Russian River's year-round wilds are better than most of the other limited wilds out there. It's a great beer with a lot going on. 763 charactersstarrdogg, Jul 28, 2012

Looks: crimson, cherry hues, shiny, a slice of candle-lit amber. Against a light, it looks like an IPA.

A: Pours an orangish-amber color with a foamy three-finger off-white head or nice retention. Plenty of lacing on the glass. Large chunks of yeast sediment floating around here.
S: Cherry notes are the most prevalent here, with plenty of sour yeast character present as well. Hints of berry notes in the background here.
T: Opens with dark cherry notes that give way to a proper level of sourness, just below lip-puckering level. Wine barrel notes come through on the finish and help to balance the sourness. The flavors make this one very easy to finish quickly.
M: Medium-bodied with plenty of prickly carbonation and a dry finish. Suits the flavors very nicely and makes me want to come back for another sip just after most of the sourness fades away.
O: This beer is my new standard for sours. I would highly recommend trying it at least once even if the price is high. 1,037 charactersschlimenhaumer, Jul 18, 2012

A: Hazy mahogany with amber highlights. 3 fingers of head that dissipates quickly. Moderate carbonation.
N: Sawdust, caramelized brown sugar, peach, nectarine and cherry as well as notes of chocolate and barnyard.
T: Upfront - Nectarine, lactic acid, lemon warheads and brown sugar along with hints of balsamic and sawdust.
Mid-palate - Sour cherry, red wine (Pinot Noir), hints of black currant and blueberry.
Finish - Chestnut, naked oak, hints of chocolate and tobacco. Lingering peaches and chestnuts.
M: Light bodied, tart, clean, slightly puckering and refreshing.
O: Extremely complex with a moderate sourness. Transforms multiple times throughout the palate. Big, oaky characteristics with a good emphasis on sweet red wine. A lot of fruity and nutty flavors going on as well. There's not as much barnyard as reviews suggest, more of a lactic sourness. Phenomenal! 909 charactersjustintcoons, Jul 15, 2012

A- Pours a cloudy burnt orange amber color, with 3 fingers tan head that leaves some nice lacing as it goes down.
S- Smells very vinous. Sour grapes, and tart apples add a fruitiness to it. Mild funk factor. An extremely aromatic beer.
T- Tart, sour, cherries hit first followed by a pleasant earthy taste. This is unlike any beer I have ever had. A wonderful sour mixed correctly with wine characteristics as so they both compliment each other. Well done. 
M- Lively carbonation dances on the tongue, for a short time upon drinking. Nice dry finish with sticky flavors.
O- Very impressed. Russian River is successful in merging the fine characteristics of wine to the fine characteristics of beer. A must try sour. Glad I have another bottle. 779 charactersrfbenavi80, Jul 08, 2012

A - Cherry ruby with a 1 finger rose bubbly head with good retention and excellent lacing.
S - Cherries, apricots, pino wine.
T - Such a rich experience. The fruit in the beer lighten the whole affair while the casking flavors deep complex tannins, funky yeast, sourness, and a bit of bready bitter just rock the palate. Great combo of complex wild ale and wine flavors.
M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, chewy, sticky.

A - Ruby-red brown coloring. A bit murky. One finger of a creamy light-tan head. Decent retention, great lacing.
S - Vinous, earthy, and less ripened cherry skins. Touch of lemon vinegar. Port-like oak barrel note. Light carmelized malts.
T - Soft wine grapes at front palate. Sourness kicks in at the middle and transitions into a more ripe cherry note with dry oak and spices at the back.
M - Light body, very dry finish with semi-sweet cherry and citrus finish. Appropriate carbonation.
D - A bit more graceful than your typical sour. Unique in that I can sense the alterations between both the grapes and the cherries. Very easy to revisit this one and for that I am thankful. 774 charactersAuracom, Jul 06, 2012

A: Cloudy brownish-amber in color. Forms a minimal off-white colored head. Some light lacing. 
S: Strongly aromatic with the scent of sour cherries, red wine, green apples, red wine vinegar, and just a slight hint of oak. 
T: Rather vinous. Starts off with notes of sour cherries, unripe apple, and red wine vinegar. Then the flavor turns earthy, oaky, and musty with a mild funkiness. Exceedingly long, earthy finish just lingers on the tongue. 
M: On the lighter side of medium with a rather crisp, acetic, and downright sour mouthfeel to it. Good carbonation. 
O: Take my review for what it is worth as I admittedly don't care much for sours, though I do tend to like and appreciate RR sour beers. But something about this beer just didn't sit right with me. And while I do think this a very finely crafted beer, I think I just found it too sour, too acetic, too similar to the beginnings of a nice salad dressing for me to be able to really enjoy it. 967 charactersFlorida9, Jul 01, 2012

A- Pours a slightly golden reddish brown. On the darker side, but translucent. About a finger of white with slight hue of yellowish brown foamy head with good retention. Above average carbonation. Leaves nice lacing.
S- Sour cherries, sour apple, pinot noir, a little bit of yeast, vinegar, acetic notes. Very aromatic, smelled almost instantly after the cork popped off, one of the most aromatic beers I've ever encountered. Nice sour/funk smell too.
T- Sour cherries, vinegar, sour green apple, a little bit of a sour/wine like finish. Nice lingering lightly sour aftertaste.
M- Light, crisp, refreshing, just the right amount of carbonation, great feel, very smooth, abv very well hidden.
O- This was a fantastic sour. I'm just getting into sours, but this was one of the better one's I've had. The smell was phenomenal, very aromatic and could smell forever. The flavor was also excellent- with a nice amount of sourness and fruit flavors that were very well balanced. A little bit more age probably would have helped this a little bit- the 2009 Lou Pepe Kriek I had a couple weeks ago definitely had more flavor. Definitely not bad though. For a sour of this caliber that has been barrel aged for over a year, you can't beat the price on this one. A must try for sour fans. 1,347 charactersjaasen64, Jun 30, 2012

Appearance: Dusky copper. Almost no head, but what head does form is bright-white, bubbly and loose. Pours with some carbonation and on the heavy side. Nice and still. 
Smell: Delightfully tart. Big notes of sour cherry mix with oak and slight wine characteristics. Mild funk buried under delicious cherry flavors. Lactic acid is on point. Gotta love that Russian River wild ale aroma. There's magic in those barrels. Woody and sour. 
Taste: Sour cherry loaded with oak goodness. Smooth wood layered over a bright citric acid bite. Lactic acid adds a nice element. Pulls like a white wine fused with tart cherry flesh. Juicy cherry flesh. Almost sherry-like booziness. Sweet in good measure. The barrel really helps blend everything together. 
Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth. Body runs almost full and smooth. Minimal carbonation. Tart edge dries the tongue and begs for another sip. 
Overall: My favorite offering in theRussian River wild ale lineup. A solid blend of fruit and barrel tartness. More of this would never be a bad thing. 1,080 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jun 24, 2012

A- 1 finger of a coarse light tan foam. It's a bit champagne like at first with bubbles rising through the glass. No lacing and the color looks like a Roobios (SP?) tea.
S- Fruity sour a little medicine-y twinge of green apple with a musty almost nutty smell at the end (Oak ?) As it warms in the glass the Pinot really comes through.
T- Cider-like that drops off sharply to a sour cherry and mild currant. The malt characteristic is really not present but the tannins are revealed when you exhale. It does become more wine-y as you drink it. 
M- effervescent at first that mellows to a level of a cask ale. It is only mildly sweet, but the sour zing comes more from under the tounge. It is also somewhat dry 
O- Its a great sour, gets better with every sip. Would age well, would pair well with cheese. Its wine its beer its sour its great! Its an experience! 876 charactersUncle_Jimmy, Jun 20, 2012

S: Currants, funk, feet, earth. Oak and fresh cider apples and sour cherries. Maybe a pinch of cave aged gouda at the very end?
T: Obviously, the first thing that hits you is the sour characteristics of this crazy beer. It has a wild and complex array of sour apple, malt, pinot noir, funk fusion going on. The finish is clean and tight. 
M: It's not as tannic as you would think and leaves the sides of your tongue alone. It's extremely palatable and smooth to drink.

Smells of sour cherries with a slight earthiness.
Tastes of the tart cherries with various counter notes. The cherries lead off with a moderate lactic sourness. This then fades into a white wine like sweetness. Earthy undertones are present throughout to give the beer some depth.

See all descriptions below for appearance, taste, mouthfeel, etc. Overall, a wonderful sour, and a great beer. Definitely something I would drink again given the opportunity. Looking forward to trying some additional Russian River beers. Only quasi-complaint is the price point. 
With that said, for my palate, I actually prefer Le Terroir. Honestly. Maybe that's just me.
**Edit: After more extensive sour testing, this is defintely a higher quality beer than I initially gave it credit for. Raised to a solid 4.5. I look forward to trying this again. 715 charactersthebigredone, Jun 08, 2012

The beer pours a dark amber with a thin tan head. The nose is pungently sour with notes of acetone, wine, and a slight yeastiness. Very intense flavor profile with bursting tart cherries and an incredibly dry finish. This may be one of the driest and most tart sours I've had, but it's incredibly drinkable. Definitely worth trying if you can finagle a bottle. 400 charactersThePorterSorter, Jun 01, 2012

Score: 93
Batch 010. 355 ml bottle served in a Great Lakes snifter and enjoyed on 05/17/12. Review is from notes.
Appearance: Pours a dark copper color with a thin layer of fizzy head at pour that settles into a fizzy ring around the glass. Poor lacing, but decent retention. 4/5
Smell: Funky vinegar and lots of white grape and pear. Stale/dirty/earthy orange malt. Some "cheap plastic band-aid" aroma too. 4/5
Taste: Bright orange, white wine and acidic, tart white grape. Sour cherries and a little fruity pear flavor too. Lots of crisp flavor, but a very nice bitter sweet-and-sour mix of flavors with only a modest funk. Layering, dry tartness and increasing pucker effect. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, high carbonation. Nice zesty tart citrus pop and sizzle on the tongue. Tart, dry finish. 4.5/5
Overall: A very tasty sweet-and-sour wild ale. The nose was pretty funky, making me skeptical as to whether I would enjoy the beer, but the taste is much smoother and not very funky.
Recommendation: A great non-funky sour. I'd recommend this even for the casual beer drinker. Fans of Citra-hopped beers like Zombie Dust and Heady Topper will probably enjoy this one a lot.
Pairings: Eight year old white cheddar cheese with Parmesan black pepper crackers.
Cost: $10 for a 355 ml bottle made from glass that is so thick, you'd swear this was a blunt weapon. 1,592 charactersjegross2, May 24, 2012

Ok, I am spoiled by living in Europe for the past few years and having visited the Lambic region in Belgium many times. This is a great beer, no doubt, and I love it, but there are many out there that have a lessor rating that could and should be rated better. Many from the Lambic region that are pretty obscure (not going to list any plugs for other beers on this Supplication review).
A: Deep ruby-brown hued with a golden amber tone! Looks so delish!! Nice one finger head.
S: Sour and bitter...really nice! The cherries (big time sour cherries!!!) and pinot noir are in there with an awesome balance of fruity flavors! Nice!
T: Wow! so nice. Love the sour notes and the cherries and the oak and pinot background notes. Now I know why this beer is rated a 99!
M: Smooth and bitterly sweet...really nice!
O: Worthy. I like it a lot. Really coming on board with RR wild ales and this one did not disappoint! Simply put...wow. 957 characters4thelvofbeer, May 23, 2012

Pours a reddish brown amber with a small white head settles to a ring and leaves some very light lacing on the glass. The aroma has lots of lactic acid. Cherry, funky earthiness, slight hop presence, and a hint of acetic acid. The taste is tart with a light initial sweetness. Lots of lactic, decent amount of cherry, and just a bit of brett funkiness. The finish is tart and drying with a bit of acetic acid. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Certainly one of the best regularly available sours. 535 charactersjethrodium, May 22, 2012

Pretty darn great, dry and sour and really well balanced. Cherry is subtle and works well.

A- To start, it does not look good. The color is dirty-water brown with some red tones. Not much head, no lacing. Bubbly.
S-Cheap cherry wine. Boones Farm 'beer', if you will.
T- We're getting better. A sour blast of something drinkable. But what? It's not beer or wine. The finishing flavors are so sour that they border on rancid. 
M- The sour tang and lively carbonation work here. It feels ok, but still tastes bad.
O-I would dump this in the Russian River if I could. Maybe I'll revisit it in the future but why bother? 574 charactersNiceTaps, May 13, 2012

Moderate head builds; lots of soap, fades fast too. No lacing, but great clarity for this type of brew. The head is to be expected. 
Huge cherry notes. Big sour scent. Almost stings the nose. 
Whoa! Immediate sourness smacks your palette. Then cherry bitter cherry skin kicks in... This loses it a bit for me; it's very black cherry. Carbonation is very high, but fits the flavor/style well. Dryness is moderate with decent sweetness to assist.
Recommended. I'm anxious to see where this brew goes in time... I'll be sure to update. It's sour, but not mind buckling sour. The Pinot Noir barrels do this brew wonders. 630 characterschugalug06, May 13, 2012

375ml bottle (batch 7) poured into RR Tulip
A: Reddish brown color, it's transparent, but a bit murky. Lots of bubbles forming in the bottom of the cup. Half a finger head, almost no lacing. 
S: Sour fruit... (cherries probably as written on the bottle - hard to make out), yeast, vinegar-like scent, maybe a bit of grapes
T: Tartness and sourness hit you - then a small pause - then more sourness towards the end. I get the wine flavor in my mouth a little bit and at the end lingering (mostly as an after taste), but it's mostly sour, acidic, and tart cherries, lemon (especially in the middle and towards the end, lemon kicks in, followed by extreme second wave of sourness). Very very sour (but not as sour as Beatification)
M: High carbonation, light-to-medium body. Near Perfect. 
O: I enjoyed this bottle a lot more than my first one. In fact, I will drink this more in the near future. I still seem to prefer Temptation and Beatification over this one, but regardless, an excellent sour. 1,107 characterssukwonee, May 08, 2012

At the beginning of the pour it was a golden color but by the end it was a bright reddish orange with one finger of fizzy white head the quickly recedes to a thin ring around the edge of the glass.
The nose is full of oak funk up front, behind that a tart lactic acidity and then even behind that a sharp acetic sour cherry smell. As it warms the oak subsides and it gets more tart. It is now almost room temp and the fruit has really opened up into a complex cherry aroma with some definite pinot like scents (currants, cherries, bright red berries) with just the slightest metallic twang.
The flavor is very tart and somewhat puckering but not overpoweringly sour. Some dry oaky bitterness behind the fruit.
Relatively thin body which is to be expected for the style and a moderate amount of carbonation that avoids being spritzy
Overall this is a high quality sour, really glad I had the whole little bottle to myself to let it warm up and explore the intricacies, I will definitely pick this up again if I see it. 1,032 charactersquirkzoo, May 01, 2012

My review is from batch 007... look at that... drinking James Bond beer! 
I poured Supplication into a snifter to hold in the great smell coming off the beer. Speaking of, this beer smells amazing. You get a great dose of sour coming off the top. There is also a decent amount of cherry. 
Supplication looks pretty good. The foam is minimal, as expected for an aged beer (this one is almost five years!). There is also some pretty good alcohol legs on the glass.
The flavor is very vibrant. You really have to sip this because a mouthfull is just too strong. This is a great example of a sour. You can get the cherry, yeast, and pinot noir in the glass. I also like the way it tingles a little in the mouth.
This is a very good beer. I wish I didn't have to go so far out of my way to get the greatness coming from Russian River. 1,063 charactersummswimmin, Apr 21, 2012

A great dark reddish amber with so many bubbles I can't tell if there going up or down, this one is very much alive, two fingers of light tan head hold on for a little while stopping at a well retained thin film that doesn't allow you to see the liquid, just a few random dots of lace 
S right out of the bottle as I pour I get some woody vinous notes, the funk is mild and blends in perfectly with the oak and some sour strawberry and cherry, there's a little vinegar and cider notes but everything just blends together so well after a few minuets I struggle to pin point anything it all just meshes together, what amazing stuff 
T it mimics the smell very well thankfully, one second I'm getting some oaked vinous notes, then it morphs to sour cherry and the next sip the funk comes out to play, just wonderful stuff 
M sour but not turning my mouth inside out, plenty of pin prick bubbles no doubt about that, leaves the mouth a little slick, and a little cherry vinegar lingers 
O an epiphany in a glass of beer? this one's an eye opener for me, what else in life have I been missing out on? 
 This ones changed the way I look at sours, such a well made brew, many things needed to happen in just the right proportion and order to make this what it is. On top of that it also needed to be well packaged and sent to me by the most generous and awesome Rutager 1,501 characterswordemupg, Apr 18, 2012

A: Pours a cloudy dark golden orange (almost copper) in color. The beer has a half finger tall dense off-white head that reduces to a thin layer over the entire surface with a thicker ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate lacing is observed.
S: Some really great traditional aromas for a wild ale - sour/tart cherry, grape skins, hay, and barnyard funk. There are also some herbal and floral notes. Hints of lemon citrus and brett.
T: The flavor of the barrel comes through in this beer contributing some nice oakiness but the flavors really follow the smell. This beer has a decent amount of sourness but is not over the top - there is tart/sour cherries, some funkiness, and a measure of red wine tannins.
M: On the lighter side of medium bodied with heavy amounts of carbonation. Prickly.
O: This is a great sour beer and one that I could enjoy drinking very regularly if only it was more easily available. This beer embodies what a sour/wild ale should be. Not overly sour to put off people new to the style but still really great. 1,072 charactersdbrauneis, Apr 15, 2012

A: Supplication is a dark, somewhat cloudy copper color. This particular copper, however, has hints of red towards the center of the brew and some straw gold on the edges. The head on this is gorgeous, with a consistent, tight half finger of the bubbly stuff. For the most part, it forms a neck around the edges of the beer. A hard swirl, however, brings it up to a full finger that covers the top. Very nice lacing, a moderately thick slick is left behind with each sip. 
S: Classic wild ale smells on this one: tart cherry, grape skin, musty hay, funk. The herbal notes in the bouquet here are fairly unique...I'm getting some lavender and faint traces of sweet spice, almost like potpourri. 
T: Cherries, grapes, little bit of tomato sauce and lots and lots and lots of barrel. The wood is all over this, providing quite a bit of astringency along with the cherries. The finish is almost all wood and pucker, though I also get a surprising bready malt presence, almost grainy.
M: The sour fans will be happy, as this one packs a bit of a punch. Well-balanced, though, with the fruit and barrel flavors. Wood may be just a little too prominent for its own good, as I think the finish is bowled over by tannic and oak notes. Carbonation also seems just a touch high, covers up the flavors ever so slightly.
O: A very well-crafted wild ale by Russian River. It's not as good as Consecration, but it is still one of the better Wilds I have had. I am officially pumped to get into Beatification now. 1,537 characterssiege06nd, Apr 03, 2012

A: Half-finger just off-white head, clear brown-tinted amber color, lots of carbonation

T: Sourness, tart cherries, a good funkiness, a bit of red wine and oak, a touch of sweetness before the pleasing sour finish and aftertaste
M: Smooth, good carbonation, crisp, quality dry finish 
O: Very drinkable Wild Ale, not really a weak spot for me, a 'sipper' that went pretty quick, I could definitely drink a couple/few of these on a warm summer day 616 charactersderkfromwi, Mar 30, 2012

I suppose I bow to all thse out there that have put this beer on such a pedestool, figuring, my tastes, just don't get it.
Almost every sip brings a squint to ones face. As if one drank a very sour cherry mix. 
I know that is what these Russian River guys were going for.
It just "..ain't my cup of 'beer'"...heh.
Good for you guys that like it.

I had been saving this for my 2000th review, but then Rutager sent me something I'm sure I'll enjoy more.
A: Amber with a bubbly, cream-coloured head, some retention, shows some leg.
S: Pleasant funk, with a little tart/sour aroma.
T: The lacto & pedo sourness is a bit much for my palate, but I like the funk from the Brett. This is like a Flanders done in the Extreme American style. Leather, steelie mineral, hay, cherry, wheaty biscuit, balanced bitterness, alcohol is subtle.
M: Well-attenuated, moderate body, quite bubbly, some acidity, crisp, very dry finish.
D/O: I know this is a top 50 brew, but I'm still surprised I really like this (I'm not a sour guy). I'd say this is better than many Belgian brews... though personally, I'd still prefer a New Glarus Belgian Red. 847 charactersDerek, Mar 25, 2012

A deep red with a finger of fine off white bubbles. Head retained well and just barely stuck to the glass.
Aroma, cider vinegar, red wine vinegar, lemon zest. Sour cherry. Just a faint yeast funk.
Taste, Sour cherry and lemon zest, some hay and minor barnyard. The cider vinegar is there. Fades to an acidic grape, cherry very light tanin. Though this came together even more as it warmed, which I had not found with other sours.
A quite lively carbonation, but is very fine and almost feels creamy. Drinks easy, though I can never seem to get past one with a sour yet.
Probably about as close to as good as it gets for the style. 703 charactersBung, Mar 24, 2012
4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Southern Tier tulip.
Pours a dark, ruby amber with a big mountain of fizzy, off white head that quickly fades away. The nose has notes of white grapes, alcohol, and faint cherries. The flavor is tart and sweet with some cherries in the finish. There's a sugary, tart aftertaste that lingers. The pinot noir is evident. The mouthfeel is winy, viscous, smooth, crisp, and medium bodied.
This is my second Wild Ale. My first was Consecration. This in my opinion isn't as flavorful as Consecration, but it's delicous and worth trying. It's drinkable, flavorful, but it's a sipper. I would definitely have this again. 628 characterstdm168, Mar 24, 2012

Thanks to Woodchopper who has single-handedly brought me into the stretch run on these fabulous beers. Poured into a Houblon Chouffe flute from a 375 ml corked and caged bottle. A deep copper color with reddish highlights. Nice delicately bubbles on a big off-white head. Some patches of lacing on the glass.
Great aroma, sour citrus, cherries and some funk. Real nice. Tastes great as well. I am not a "sours" guy. Don't like a big Rodebach style blast of vinegar in my beer. The sourness here is just right with plenty of cherry flavor and funk. The sourness is more citrus than vinegar.
Mouthfeel is just right. The sourness is not overpowering and the rich cherry flavor and funkiness are just right. A nice easy sipper.
Overall this is one outstanding beer. 850 charactersJayQue, Mar 23, 2012

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A beer that I've had in my possession too long to not have tried yet. A long time want and craving. I picked up another bottle, a newer batch. Batch #007 remains in the cellar, cracking batch #008 open tonight to enjoy. I've read that this beer doesn't age with grace, so I'm excited to try a fresh bottle and even more excited to just TRY it. Russian River Supplication poured into a Tripel Karmeliet tulip.
Held to the light, the beer has a light red hue (almost pink-ish) with some brown-ing. Looks red-brown without the light. Eggshell head of an inch is falling slowly, but holding strong. The bigger bubbles are popping sporadically. 4.0
Pungently sour nose with a light spritzy fruitiness. The vinous character is more pronounced than the cherries, but the tartness reminds me of the fruit note. Light cherry, sure, but perhaps white grape with tannins. 4.5
Bretty funk out the wazoo. Lighter-bodied red wine, sour berries, oak, tannic grape skin, straw, oversteeped black iced tea. Mouth-puckering with very little residual sugars remaining. Semi-dry, but very fruity. Heaps of Brettanomyces and tangy Lacto. I pick up some tart red apple, mint, chamomile, and raw basil leaf. A bit husky without being robust. Complexities that are foaming at the mouth. Unreal good. Impressive stateside beer. 4.5
Key in the feel is the proper dose of suds and scrub. Not boisterously carbonated, just ideal for a medium-light bodied American Wild. A beer that should be savored, but drinks too fast for its own worth. That was meant to be a compliment. 4.5
If you're looking for rich fruits and deeply complex malts, this is not the beer for you. There's no hop bite in the tailend (sans a little bitterness), nor is there heavy breath-catching sourness. This wild ale is all about balance, complexity, and drinkability. Scarce in the flaw department, this beer drinks like a great wine. A real shmoozer.

Poured a clear coppery brown colour with a tinge of reddy pink... lightly tan head poured quite foamy and disappeared slowly to thin coating... fair amount of carbonation bubbles to the surface... no real lacing at all..
Aroma - Strong tart fruits (light sour apples and pears, tart cherries, lemons), champagne notes, some light almond hints, light mustiness, some wet hay notes, light red wine hints, grassy, faint candy sugar, light oak 
Taste - Very tart fruits (strong lemon notes, light cherries, grapefruits), some vinegary notes, strong brett notes, faint red wine, light nutty hints, farmhouse cider traces, floral.... the faintest sweetness emerges after a few sips...
Feel - Very sharp and dry - mouth puckeringly so... suprisingly drinkable and refreshing though..
Overall - An excellent Wild Ale and as good as some of the Belgians i've had... probably not for everyone but definitely recommended... 1,023 charactersmdagnew, Mar 21, 2012
3.44/5  rDev -23.6%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a 375mL bottle into a brandy snifter. Batch 008. Brewed on 20 August 2010. Bottled 14 November 2011.
A: No head, but lots of initial bubbles. Clearish. A ruddy orange, somewhere between amber, russet, pink, and ruby. Astounding.
S: Red wine and brettanomyces. I find little oak, but there are some rich cherries and perhaps almond.
T: Huge initial sourness reminds me unfortunately of pickle brine, one of my huge complaints against some Geuze. Indeed, the similarity in taste is not superficial. However, the added cherries come to the rescue towards the latter half of the flavour, offering an excellent sweet fruity finish. Otherwise, Supplication is dry, winey, and puckery, tasting more alcoholic than it is. Some grape peel and fermented fruit is not always pleasant.
M: The spirited carbonation (the cork shot across the room) and sheer sourness necessitate smallish sips, but the mouthfeel is none the less for that.
O: So I didn't particularly enjoy it (even though I loved Temptation), but I guess I can see where it's a goodish beer. I certainly would not recommend it, but I guess if sours are your think, grab one. Meh.
Notes
Primary Yeast: Abbey Ale Yeast
Conditioning Yeast: Rockpile
EDIT (14 April 2012): Drinking it on-tap in the brewpub, I enjoy it much more.
EDIT (10 November 2012): Batch 010. Poured from a 375mL bottle into a Koningshoeven chalice.
4A: Translucent, pale, ruddy amber. Light head, light lace.
4S: Oak and Brett. Tart fruit blends with the wood aging and conspires to smell like an Oud Bruin. Deep and tannic.
3.5T/3M: Thin and sour maintaste with a hint of balsamic vinegar. The aftertaste is candyish (think red apple Jolly Rancher). The mouthfeel lacks presence, weight, and pizazz. I don't get the appeal of this beer.
3.5O: Eh, it's alright, but RR makes a lot of beers that are better and there are many sours/wild ales that top this one. Not recommended in bottles. 1,933 charactersAgentMunky, Mar 21, 2012

4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Batch 007. Poured from a bottle into a Brooklyn tulip. Beautiful clear,dark copper-amber color with a thin head. The nose is extremely active. There are notes of cherries, bubblegum, sour apples, candy, and a definite barnyard funk, all harmoniously blended together.
The flavor is highly acidic and slightly tannic. I get flavors of tart cherries in the front of my mouth, then at mid-palate the beer takes on a stony champagne-like dryness. It has an excellent finish. The acidity dries your mouth and the sour cherry and champagne flavors linger for a long time, making you practically salivate for another taste. The beer has a light to medium body, but is not as highly carbonated as I expected it to be. It is extremely easy to drink.
This is a world class beer. The flavor is aggressively sour, but there's an underlying sweetness and a nice dry finish to complement the tartness. It's one of the most refreshing beers I've ever had and is very reminiscent of Rodenbach Grand Cru (in overall drinking experience if not in flavor). Every beer fan should seek this one out and try it at least once. I can't imagine how difficult this beer must be to make. 1,162 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Mar 17, 2012

Wondered if something was wrong with it, but for the price I was willing to find out. Poured to Duvel tulip the beer is a beautiful ruby amber with a thin white head, some retention, some lacing. Looks great for a beer aged 15 months in pinot barrels. The nose is even better, nice cherry, apple, pear fruit character mixes with with a mild brett funk, sour tartness. I don't know how this could be more inviting. The flavor is complex and perfect, really. Tart sourness at first that blends to a mild sour cherry to lightly bitter caramel with a light biscuity background. So much flavor, so much going on, it's amazing this comes together so well. Phenomenal. Good carbonation and medium to full bodied. Overall, this beer is classic. I think I am in love. I won't wait so long between bottles next time as I forgot how memorable this is. 930 charactershopfacebrew, Mar 16, 2012

Appearance: Label states it's from batch 008 (early 2012) - having aged 9-12 months in Pinot Noir barrels with cherries added. Heavy, glass-hugging, lacing around a creamy, fluffy tan head. Body is of copper/amber hue with a haste of bubbling to the peak. Brewed with Lactobacillus, Brettanomyces, Saccharomyces, and Pediococcus.
Smell: Sour cherry with definitive wine undertones. Cleanly wild yeast presence.
Taste: Tart cherries hit from the beginning with the wooden barrel's wine notes fluttering throughout. An almost vinegary/peppery presence is also noticeable.
Mouthfeel: Suites this beer properly. A strong carbonation that finishes dry and clean with minor flavorful reminiscence of the sips had, to linger. Beautifully done.
Overall: A phenomenal beer. This brewer, having once been focused on wine, knows what he is doing - and does it well. 889 charactersForb, Mar 14, 2012

Appeared a reddish brown color with a beige head. 
Smelled sour, with a definite wine presence. Could easily detect the cherries with some other sour fruits mixed in.
Taste is amazing - first you are hit with straight sourness, as though you just squeezed a lemon, then comes in some wine flavors followed by tart cherries in the finish. Truly delicious.
Mouthfeel fits this beer perfectly. Nice and light, but not watery whatsoever.
Overall this is an unbelieveable sour. I love the complexity. Not as funky as I anticipated, but still it was truly a treat to drink. Looking forward to putting the second bottle in my cellar to see what some age can do. 686 charactersTWStandley, Mar 14, 2012

A strong pour yields a 2-finger tan-colored head that slowly fades after a couple minutes to a thin coating and thick foam ring. The body is an amber reddish brown with small, swirling floaties and a great amount of rising carbonation bubbles. Thick lacing clings to the sides of the glass in sheets but always seems to succumb to gravity.
As the beer is poured, aromas of cherries and oak find their way from the crashing liquid to the drinker's nostrils. A closer inspection finds heavy aromas of cider vinegar and black cherries. Some musty funk, oak, and green bananas aromas are also detectable.
Candy-like sour cherry flavors crash into the taste buds at the beginning of each sip. Once the drinker gets past the onslaught of sour cherry, flavors of sweet red wine, cider vinegar, freshly ground pepper, and funk all tantalize the palate. Swallowing the beer lets the sourness quickly peak along with more cherry, red wine, and dirty basement funk. As these flavors fade, the sourness persists as a prickling on the tip of the tongue and a wine-like dryness sets in on the rest of the tongue.
Medium bodied with excessive carbonation, this is one steady sipping beer. The body is light enough to wash over the tongue nicely without ever becoming sticky. The carbonation is like setting a Sour Patch Kids candy on your tongue and taking a swig of Pepsi. It fizzes through every step of the sip but doesn't seem to adversely affect the transmission of flavors. The swallow becomes a bit foamy but does not hinder the experience much. The wine-like dryness at the end of each sip adds to the experience and keeps the drinker reaching for the glass.
If Russian River's Supplication were cheaper and actually available in my area I would drink this daily. 1,839 charactersoutput01x, Mar 08, 2012

Pours a clear brown body, 1/2 inch off white head. Lacing and head retention were good.
Smell is of very light vinegar but dominated by tart fruit like cherry and kumquat. There is also some oak at the end.
Taste is of straw malt mixed with sour apples. Sour pickle brine is also present along with some puckering tannins you'd get from a dry chardonnay. No hops or alcohol was detected. 
Mouthfeel is light, puckering and finishes dry. Carbonation is perfect but the head was only semi present. 
Overall this was a good refreshing beer. Would love to have this in the mountains on a spring day. Not too much into the particular style but would definitely buy another bottle whenever it rarely pops up. 740 charactersangelmonster, Mar 08, 2012

Pours a quite transparent burnt umber. Very attractive. Not much head to speak of. Just a whisper of off-white that dissipates immediately. Lots of cherries in the initial nose, but that gives way to both a sharpness of what I guess would be the pinot barrels and a bluntness of wood (guess what that's attributed to). I don't know if brett's involved, but there is a layer of funk in the nose, as well. There is a robustness to the nose, like vanilla-coated cranberries. Holy moly, this is a great sour. Just a wisp of sweetness at the start and then a torrent of pucker grabs your tongue. Getting some green apple-type pucker with deeper raisin and wine notes. At the very end, there's a semi-thick layer that blunts the sour onslaught and invites a new sip. Very interesting how much the middle bounces off the tongue and how buoyant this sour is. Great stuff.

A: Hazy dark amber brown with a redish hue. 1 fingers width sea foam white head which dissipates relatively quickly to a very small rim and leaves no lacing.
S: Brett, banana, apples, sour cherries, subtle oak and candied sugar.
T: Such powerful flavors. Big tart sourness, banana, apple, sour white grape, Belgium yeast on the finish. There is also an acidic quality, some red wine flavors come on late, and it leaves a lingering sweet after taste of banana. So good.
M/D: Heavy carbonation, medium bodied with a vibrant lively mouthfeel. You could certainly drink multiples in a session.
O: Great beer! Excellent tart sourness with some bready malt rounded out with Belgium yeast.  Well balanced with strong but not over powering sourness.   This is the third RR wild ale I've had the pleasure of drinking. All were fantastic (supplication, consecration, and temptation), I think I may slightly like temptation the best however all are wonderful and I'd gladly drink any of them any chance I could get.   1,058 characterszac16125, Feb 26, 2012

A - A very careful and slow pour results in a monstrous three to four finger head. The head is very fluffy and hangs out for a while before fading away with hardly any lacing. The beer itself if a cloudy copper color with constant carbonation bubbles streaming to the surface
S - Holy tart batman... made my mouth water excessively. Smells of apples, grapes and cherries. Can tell this one will be sour.
T - Very tart and sour on first sip, but some sweetness is present as the sip progresses. The sour flavors come from the cherries. The finish is very nice. Also, this beer hides the 7% ABV very well, as there is no noticeable alcohol flavors.

Pours hazy red orange color with a nice 1 finger light khaki head with great retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge tart cherries, green apple, grapes, pear, light vinegar, oak, red wine, hay, light spices, and a lot of funk. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity, Taste of big tart cherries, apple, grape, pear, red wine, citrus, oak, vinegar, spiciness, earthiness, hay, and funk. Lingering notes of tart fruit, oak, wine, and spices on the finish for a bit. Fantastic balance of sourness and sweetness makes this very smooth on the palate. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and acidic mouthfeel. Slightly prickly carbonation, but still very smooth drinking. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Overall this is an outstanding wild ale; with great balance, complexity, and smoothness. 1,029 characterssuperspak, Feb 22, 2012

An off white thin cap of high carb head that sits off to one side. Brilliant, consistent beading. Lacing is lovely. Nose is complex to say the least. Lots of fruity red wine funkiness backed by the bright clove/sweet bread of a good Belgian golden. On the tongue there’s a surprisingly pungent earthy sour wallop that gives way to a beautiful floral array of sweet complexities. There’s a lingering tart presence on the back of the palate. Sour cherries, of course. The feel is smooth and a bit dry I think. Wonderful. Overall, this is a sour that might even appeal to the non-sour beer drinker. Yum. 676 charactersyamar68, Feb 22, 2012

4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle, 7,0% Abv.
Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
Batch 008
Thanks to futura123 for hooking me up with this one. 
Appearance: Supplication pours a murky red-orange-brown with pink tinted edges and is topped by a good sized, very lightly pink tinted head that displays good retention and leaves a little lace. 
Smell: Mmmm, this smells delicious! After the Temptation and Supplication, I was not expecting this to smell so good! 
Tart cherries, almond, oak and earthy funk dominate the initial sniff with notes of ripe cheese, vinegar, musty basement, a light mineral character, over-ripe fruit and oddly spicy cinnamon noted over the course of the glass. As Supplication approaches room temperature the base brown ale notes become apparent with spiced dark fruit, a nutty quality and some sweetness. 
Taste: As the nose suggested, Supplication is a delicious sour. Tart cherries, oak, vinegar, light apricot, musty brett, old cheese, over-ripe stone fruit and a light spicing are all noted in the flavour. 
Mouthfeel: Again, Russian River has delivered a perfect mouthfeel! Medium body with a medium level of super smooth carbonation. The acidity is not quite enough to pucker the mouth, but gives enough of a bite to make Supplication insanely refreshing and drinkable. The finish is lightly tannic and dry. 
Overall: This is by far the best of the three Russian River sours I have had and the only one that I feel can compete with true lambics. I would love to get another bottle of this in the future. 1,537 charactersThehuntmaster, Feb 20, 2012

A- Murkey brown color with a bit of a copper hue. Very little head on this one after a couple of seconds. Some lacing as you move the glass around.
S- Some lemons, cherries, grapes oak and just a touch of funk. 
T- Super sour cherries, apples, a bit of a wine like "sweetness", a touch of caramel, and a super dry, sour finish.
M- Drinks exceptionally well for the abv. Slightly tannic, dry, fizzy.
O- Slowly becoming one of my favorite sours out there. Worth the price tag for sure. 538 charactersPerHops, Feb 19, 2012

Appearance: cloudy orange/rubyish, one finger off white beautiful head with tiny bubbles and a little bit of lacing.
Smell: Sour cherries are very prominent in the nose mixed with sour apples. Then there are wilder aromas followed by more tart cherries.
Taste: Nicely sour, with tons of cherry and oak flavors. Incredibly balanced with the sweet and sour notes. Not overly sour, just complex and warm. It has some slightly bitter qualities as well.
Mouthfeel: Light, carbonated and bubbly. Very crisp and refreshing. Extremely drinkable. The sourness isn't too overpowering either.
Overall: A truly excellent sour, with very nice fruit flavors. A perfect balance of sour and sweet to keep you wanting another sip. 751 charactersSoCalStout, Feb 16, 2012

Brett mixes with a red wine character with notes of oak and sweetness...cherry also appears in the nose with hints of pineapple and other lighter fruit. A perfect blend of brett funk and other aromas.
Taste is cherry, light fruit up front...almost sweet-tart like that goes into a bigger fruit, cherry character and ends on a slightly bitter, funky brett character. The sourness is just fantastic; it is quite sour in a pleasing way. The bacteria really blend into a sourness that does not stand out as just brett or just pedio...the red wine and barrel character sit in the back to add insane complexity. The best American sour I've had.
Lighter body and high carbonation work perfectly. 
I'm not going to recap here. Just an amazing beer. 788 charactersTenHornsProud, Feb 15, 2012

Slightly hazy mahogany color with a constant stream of tiny bubbles that maintain a small slick of a head on the surface and a ring around the glass. 
Inviting bouquet - cherries, barnyard funk. Complex flavors of cherry, funk, nutty malt and tartness. A big flavorful beer that is bold, complex, subtle and sublime. Amazing. 
Tart but smooth with a sharp fine carbonation.
A great sipping beer. Very nice with Kevin's deluxe blue cheese - caramelized onion, and fig pizza. 531 charactersCliffBrake, Feb 15, 2012
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5[Best served in a Tulip glass]
The pour was a medium murky chestnut brown with an average sized (1-2 finger) creamy light beige head, that reduced slowly to a thin layer of foam with a collar producing some mighty fine sheeting of sticky lacing.
The aroma was bold and fruity with a dark bread malt and some Brett yeast along with some notes of cherry, oak and a bit of red wine.
The taste was incredibly sweetly tart and very malty with a slight hint of wine in the beginning, then becoming boldly sour with a nice strong malty cherry presence and a hint of oak at the end. The flavor lasted a very long time allowing for the sour cherry wine flavor to be fully enjoyed as it relaxed on the taste buds.
Mouthfeel was a solid medium in body with a creamy dry texture and a carbonation reminiscent of champagne.
Overall, all that has to be said is WOW what an incredible brew. This brew was most likely one of the best things I have ever put to my lips. Just sayin'... 972 charactersKajII, Feb 14, 2012

SO excited to drink this... tried it on draught at RR about 2 years ago, which seems like forever ago. 
12.68 fl. oz. bottle poured into my newly acquired catawba valley brewing Co. snifter.
Picking up the nose 2 feet away, straight from the pour. Almost looks like a bourbon color to me (probably b/c i've been pouring some Buffalo Trace lately :) amber/deep orange color. Very cloudy and very bubbly. 2 fingers worth of eggshell head. Awesome looking beer.
Crazy unique smell. Smells wonderfully fruity fresh, flowery wild yeast. Crisp, clean, earthy aromas. Most complex beer I've ever smelled and it's not even close. Very tart... a bit boozey, but not overwhelming. Dirty brett barnyard funkiness. just heavenly.
Taste is very tart, very sour. absolutely incredible. Lots of tart cherry flavors coming thru. GREAT stuff. Pucker power for sure. Some pineapple/strawberries coming thru too. No oaky/woody barrel tones at all, not at all like a lambic either. Can taste some pinot noir characteristics - my favorite wine too. I just LOVE it. Absolutely phenomenal. Super complex stuff here. almost like liquid sweet tarts. I could drink this all night long. 
Pretty dry, wine-like finish, very carbonated.
Really wish I had another one of these in the fridge. The best sour beer I’ve ever had, might be the best beer I've ever had too. RR rules. thanks again Jeff. 1,438 charactersheelsn02, Feb 13, 2012

A moderate pour produces a curious shade of red/peach/blood orange, a rather unique color. About a centimeter of dirty white head that lingers briefly before leaving a ring of bubbles around the surface and a few scattered patches across it. Little in the way of lacing. 
The aroma is of tart cherries, some peach, a bit of oak, some funky yeast, hay, straw, and small elements of orange and grapefruit citrus. Really though, tart cherries and a certain white wine essence really carry the nose through in a wonderful fashion. 
The taste begins with subtle fruits: cherry, tangerine, grapefruit. It gives way to sour cherry esters, a dry oak flavor, white wine, various light grains, and a hearty dose of funk. The sour really kicks in on the swallow, but subdues quickly. 
Plenty of carbonation to keep this one alive, despite the somewhat lacking head. Dry finish that keeps you coming back. 
Overall, this is phenomenal. A strong sour cherry presence that plays beautifully off of the more subtle citrus and light grain notes; the wine barrels add an extra layer of complexity that will certainly keep one coming back for more. 1,242 characterseclipse54, Feb 12, 2012

A: A dark red/orange color. Curious looking--I don't think I've seen too many beers with hues like this. It doesn't have too much in the way of head, but it is very obviously carbonated. It's almost shaking with bubbles.
S: Fruity, with pears, apples, and cherries coming to mind. It has a sort of malt scent I associate with Belgian Ales. Kind of peppery.
T: Wow. Sweet and sour, with a Belgian aftertaste. Tangy and bubbly like champagne. Now that I think about it, I think this beer IS champagne. Did someone make a mistake? All things considered, it is absolutely delicious.
M: Again, champagne comes to mind. Tart, dry, bubbly, and warming on the end. I love it.
O: After the initial smell, I wasn't sure what to think. But a few sips and it completely won me over. This stuff is awesome, and I'll get it in the future if I can. 874 charactersMcD0uche, Feb 11, 2012

The beer is gourgeous in the tulip glass. Caramel colors throughout with delicate, persistent head.
The nose is cherries with hints of the tartness to come.
The taste starts dry, like good brut champagne, then hits the wood & dark cherries, finishing with a refreshing tartness. I don't want the beer to end!
Mouthfeel is perfect for the style. Bubbly & light, again, like good champagne.
Ok, I'll admit, I knew this beer was going to be great. If I could make something this good at home, I don't know if I'd ever leave. Another fantastic offering from one of America's top breweries. 716 charactersChBass, Feb 10, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served on tap at Russian River brewing company, Santa Rosa Ca. First I'll have to warn that this is the most expensive beer that RR makes, coming in at $12 for a 12oz bottle, so the best way to enjoy it is by the glass which is only about 6 bucks. The reason being is that this beer is aged in pinot noir barrels in the nearby wine country, and uses expensive ingredients such as the sour cherries which gives the brown ale the sour. 
Most people will admit they don't like sour beer, and it does sound gross at first, but give this a try and you won't be disappointed. This is the kind of sour ale where each sip beckons for the next. A refreshing change from the hop overload of RR's famous other beers. The taste is dominated by the sourness of it, but in an enjoyable way. The mouthfeel is wine like in it's tartness, but entices you to drink more. This is a beer that defines specialty, hand craftsmanship, and care. Get it on tap if you can, this beer does NOT bottle well. 980 charactersBenHesk12, Feb 07, 2012

On-draft at Falling Rock Taphouse
From notes.
A: Medium burgundy. 1.5 (white) fingernail head.
S: Sweet cherry, tart apples, oak, vanilla, and hint of fig. Nice!
T: Much like the nose, but oh so tasty! Sweet cherry up-front with immediate dry tartness. Hints of oak and bacteria blend amazingly well together with a masterful (soft) citrus finish. Delicious through and through and to enjoy it on draft is even better than the bottle.
M: Light-medium bodied with medium carbonation. 
O: Another fantastic beer from RR! This one is usually my go-to beer from RR as it is usually readily available and uber choice all-around. The complexity, yet simplicity is so perfect that words do not do it justice. If you haven't tried it, go get it! If you have tried it and don't like it, send the rest my way. If you enjoy it like me, I dig your style and maybe I'll invite you when I crack open the large format - that will be epic. 962 charactersspdyfire83, Feb 06, 2012

Very nice mouthfeel, but the flavor is the star of the show, and I believe this flavor earned an Oscar nomination in my eyes. This beer has gone to territory only held previously by Abyss and BCBS.

A- Pours a dark amber/ruby color with two fingers of creamy, thick beige head.
S- Big sour funk, dark cherries, oak, vinous character blends into the background. 
T- Big tart flavor up front, it's strong but not as palate thrashingly sour as some lambics and gueuze. Dark cherries and dry wine flavors blend nicely together well along with more acetic sourness. A bit of fruity sugar towards the finish. Yeast funk rounds everything out, but isn't that powerful by any stretch. Some light, sweet malts.
M- Medium-bodied, creamy, smooth feel, big tartness slides into a dry, slightly astringent finish.
O- One of the best American sour beers you can get, a really tasty, refreshing brew. 775 charactersWillCarrera, Feb 05, 2012

The balance between the head and body is exceptional... maybe I am just a pro at pouring. Leaves a light lacing around the tulip glass as carbonation continues to rise. Looks like the standard for a tart brown ale 
Smells - fruity and tart. Wife says she can smell a bitter fermentation.
Taste - The sourness stands out heavily from the lactobacillus and pediococcus, fruity tart from cherries. Grapefruit tartness hangs at the end. Having a hard time pulling the Brett our with the overpowering sourness. 
Overall - Refreshingly well-balanced between the sour and fruit. Great for a sunny afternoon picnic or just complimenting some brie crackers. If you like sours this is the one to have. 776 charactersabrethanson, Feb 05, 2012

Supplication pours with a ruddy, copper-tinted amber hue. Active carbonation streams up at the edges of the glass to fuel a well-retained cap of tan khaki head. Excellent aroma is bursting with tart cherry juice and skin. Oaky wine barrels creep into the background with an earthy, tannic funk that plays well off the tartness. There's even the slightest note of vanilla sweetness to round off the profile.
The flavor impeccably recreates what the aroma suggested this beer would bring--dry, acetic wine notes laced with cherry tartness and wooden funk. My only qualm is the mouthfeel, as I feel that a tighter, creamier carbonation level would allow this beer to explore the palate a bit longer. Still, my nit-pick is a minor one. This is a fantastic sour ale and an essential representative of the style. 857 characterswagenvolks, Feb 03, 2012

A good looking ruby brew with a huge white foamy head that recedes to leave a ring of bubbles and good lacing.
Nose is of sour and tart cherry, oak cask, a good amount of funk and a slight sweetness. 
Taste is fairly complex, the cherry takes front and center with layers of funk, the wine barrel comes through nicely, a slight sweetness and a slight tanic taste in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin with a decent amount of carbonation.
Supplication is a good wild ale, not overly sour or sweet but very approachable. 660 charactersalpineclimber, Jan 31, 2012

A: Red colour and a 5 mm head that fades leaving little lacing. Shake the glass and the head comes back. 4
S: Malt, lemon rind and some sourness. Pleasant. 4
T: Sourness with hints of wood. Dry. The sourness dominates over the malt. There is some sour funk from the bugs as well as some bitter grape sourness from the wine. The finish is a a mix of grapeskins and a little funk. So many flavours in there and yet they combine into something great. 4.5

S - Smell is very tart. A good amount of grape/wine in the nose. There is also some sour cherry.
T - At the first sip, the flavor overwhelms, in a good way. The smell was an indication of what I would find in the taste. It's incredibly tart/sour. There's a bit of wine and sour cherry or raspberry in it. The Brett comes out hard in the taste.
M - The carbonation compliments the flavor quite well. There's a lot of effervescence that spreads the flavor throughout my palate. 
Overall, this is a remarkable beer. This has been staring at me from my fridge for a while and it's been well worth the wait. I've had a few wilds, but this one sets the bar quite high. 801 charactersgdrydenc, Jan 29, 2012

A: Pours a cloudy amber golden color with a quickly receding fizzy off-white head. No lace.
S: Tart, Brett sourness, sweet wet grass, some juicy fruit character, lemon peel, all mixing wonderfully with the cherries. A touch of oak.
T: Cherry, lemon juice, and Brett overwhelm the palette...lactic sourness and light vinous notes. Some creamy, woody oak character provides a facade of balance. Puckeringly tart but quite enjoyable for me, and I'm not a sour fan.
MF: Smacks of wet, crisp tartness. Lighter body for sure. Refreshing.
O: Truly a good beer. 'Delicate' comes to mind, its not too over-the-top or in-your-face like other Brett sours, the barrel aging and cherries are a perfect combination. 815 charactersScotchboy, Jan 26, 2012

This is another beer that I'm glad I finally got to try. It pours a deep reddish mahogany with small particles floating in the beer. The beer itself is topped off with a thin off white head that quickly fades to a ring around the center. The aroma is subtle but complex, tobacco, plums, raisins, figs, tart cherries, and currants. The lactic aroma is more subtle then other RR beers. Peaking through the other aromas is a bit of funk, but not a pronounced amount of funk. The flavor is just as complex as the aroma, figs, plums, raisins and cherries with sour tones. The carbonation is at a minimum and the body is medium-light with a lingering sour finish. Excellent beer and something I would definitely seek out again. 857 charactersjamescain, Jan 25, 2012

The beer is a clear dark Amber with a fine white head of very modest height.
No aroma at all. Odd.
Flavor is slightly sweet, peachy before the sourness kicks in. Somewhere between tart and unbearable, it is long lasting and fairly well- moderated. The finish is lightly bitter. Overall, fairly straightforward and lacking in complexity.

Tart aromas of wild yeast, apple cider and sour cherries.
Opens with a tart snap of cider and biscuity malt flavors. Active, prickly carbonation throughout. Moves into a balsamic vinegar middle with hints of wild yeast and sour cherries. Puckering mouthfeel. Sharp hop presence emerges before reverting to mild malt sweetness. Finishes dry with a touch of wood smoke. So very sessionable; many regrets that I had time for only one.

What a beer. It's nearly the perfect sour. Sour cherries and brett funk dominate the aroma. The taste is so complex. Sour cherries. Tartness. Sourness. Oak. Mouth watering. Red Sour Patch Kids, liquified. It was a real challenge for me to work through a bottle of Supplication. It is so good, but it made my mouth work too damn hard. Too much salivating and puckering. That can be taken as a tongue-in-cheek compliment, but it is also its only detracting quality. I can't sit and drink bottle after bottle of this. My mouth would. not. survive. 576 charactersstealth, Jan 12, 2012

Appearance: Brown and ruby colored body. Rather clear, but I didn't get a tone of head activity on a gentle pour into a wine glass.
Aroma: Tart nose, but hints at balancing sweetness. Some red wine tannins. 
Taste: Great rush of tang from the cherry tartness combining with sweet malt and complex funk of everything else. As I enjoyed each bottle, I found it a marvel in that every drink allowed me to enjoy the complexity of the beer in new ways. Sour, sometimes puckeringly so, is not that best word to describe this beer. That would sell the sweetness and funk short.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Pretty rich beer to drink. Not all that heavy in the mouth, but the high stakes flavors make this one a huge endeavor. A tasty endeavor.
Overall: One of the best sours I've ever had, which isn't saying a ton. But I have been lucky to sample a few Russian River sours in the past in this is by far my favorite one. 1,073 characterssoze47, Jan 09, 2012

Pours clear copper color with some whispy white head. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells ridiculously good: sweet cherry and loads of oak and spice, some brett. Taste is more fruit forward (red fruit like cherry), brett, lacto, just a little oak, with some mild bright acidity. The oak aroma is huge compared with the taste. Medium body and medium-high carbonation. Overall, an excellent, very drinkable wild ale. The tartness is really mild. I love the Pinot (my favorite wine) characteristics that come through.

The beer poured an nice amber/red and had a nice single finger head with itty-bitty bubbles throughout.
The nose was of sour cherries with a little bit of wood.
The taste was a dry tartness with a slight dark fruit bitterness developing into sour cherries and finishing with oak on the tongue.
The mouthfeel was elegant and fitting for as much esteem as I have heard this beer receive over the past few months.
Overall this is a great beer with a dry finish that doesn't turn me off like some beers I have recently tasted. Not much sweet which I found very inviting for this beer. 724 charactersJtthegreat, Jan 08, 2012

This was the first American Wild Ale I ever tasted, back in 2008, and I remember actually liking it despite the total sourness of it all. I had a college buddy whose Dad was a beer collector and he broke these out randomly one night for me. Great guy...
This is Batch 8. Poured into a wine glass.
Very attractive beer, with a robust off-white head, and an excellent clarity. Beautiful hues of red, orange and copper. Careful not to pour out any of the yeast!
Smells like sweet cherries and funky funk. Definitely has a sweetness to the aroma which is quite a pleasant contrast to the obvious "wild" aroma.
The beer is actually less sweet than anticipated and is only slightly less great than I remember it to be. Soft notes of cherry are present throughout and become more predominant as the palate becomes more adjusted to the sourness. 
Great amount of carbonation for the style and it has that characteristic enamel-stripping quality. Medium body.
This is a favorite beer of mine, and has remained very close to what I remember from before. I consider this to be my current benchmark of the American Wild Ale category. 1,204 charactersMusicaleMike, Jan 08, 2012

4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375mL bottle of Russian River Supplication - batch number 8.
Appearance: Supplication pours an interesting blood orange color that produces a frothy off-white head that slowly fizzles down to a thin, film-like layer.
Smell: there's a bit of funkiness in the nose.. Pinot Noir barrels inoculated with brettanomyces makes for a very nice aroma.
Taste: Supplication's fruit juiciness really sets it apart from the much drier Consecration; the sour cherries seem to enhance this barrel aged offering in a way that currants simply cannot. The wine barrel adds another layer of complexity by imparting its oakiness and Pinot Noir flavors.. and the bacteria (lacto and pedio) adds a very pleasant sourness to this stellar wild ale.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied with plenty of carbonation (refermented in the bottle).
Overall: Supplication is surprisingly refreshing.. and complex. Truly a world-class beer. 900 charactersBlastBeats, Jan 05, 2012
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 008
Pours a slightly murky brown with hints of gold with a quickly dissipated head.
Smells at first of tart cherries meets wine, then some thing different and funky, those must be the bacterias.
Taste is all pucker, sour fruit candy, slightly winey and a lemony tart finish, with a hint of musk(which I really like).
Feels light and bubbly, kind of champagny, kind of lambic, kind of winey. 
What is this? I admit this is my first sour, and I enjoyed it. Though confusing to me as a beer, it fits the style described by the site. Huge wine characteristics make the flavors complex and tangy. Bizarre, to say the least, it's like a hybrid of several different things, perhaps not my style, but I can see how this style is love it or hate it. Funny thing is, I'm kind of in the middle.

A - beautiful red dark amberish hue. Not exactly clear, but close enough for the style
S - funk, tart aroma with a little sour cherry and lemon.
T - Wow! The tart, sour, mouth Pickering lactic acid is a kick in the pallet! Awesome beer. The oak, cherry, sour balance is unbelievable. It finishes with a lingering lemony lactic taste, with a very very slight vinegar/acetic touch. Fantastic! The Pinot noir barrel adds a bit of depth that really comes out as it warms.
M - sparkling carbonation on the tongue. Medium body, crisp from start to finish. 
O - Outstanding beer!!! I could honestly drink this everyday! It's tart/sour enough, but displays the beautiful notes that fruit and Pinot noir can add to this style. Beautifully sour, but drinkable beyond belief. I'd recommend this beer as the best 'American Wild' that i've tried. 907 charactersactone2001, Jan 03, 2012

Appearance: Slight head that reduced to a thin layer. Hazy reddish brown with signs of carbonation coming up through the center of the glass. Lots of tiny little bubbles. A very wild ale this beer must be.
Smell: sour and tart cherries, pinot noir aroma, oak, a nice yeasty and bacteria funk. I can't wait to take a sip. Super funkiness going on here. Whoa.
Taste: This bottle has conditioned nicely and blended all the flavors together great. The sourness and tartness from the cherries come out first. A nice funky and yeasty taste similar to rubber tires, but these tires are not as bad as other wilds and easily bearable, which makes me extremely happy at the moment.
Mouthfeel: Lots of carboantion, light bodied, somewhat dry on the palate and puckering too. Very interesting and great to drink. It keeps me wondering. If the carbonation could be toned down a bit, this could go down like water. 
Overall: Wild ales are growing on me and seem to get better with each one I have and each BBF I volunteer for. If it wasn't for the fests, I would have very little knowledge or experience with these sour and funky beer. I am happy to have brought this back safely from Denver and to start off the new year in Boston on a good note. 1,442 charactersFlounder57, Jan 01, 2012

Appearance - Slightly hazy red/copper colour with an averge size fizzy white coloured head. There is a high amount of carbonation showing and there is some fair lacing. The head lasted for only a few minutes.
Smell - Lemons, cherries, funk, wheat, yeast
Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste citric acid/lemons, wheat, yeast, and cherries. There is also a bit of a vinegar taste. It ends with a tart lemon/cherry flavour.
Overall - Just a fantastic beer and drinking experience. It's got the flavours found in a average sour but there is also a level of complexity that keeps it interesting throughout. I'm happy I picked this one for review 1000 and I'm looking forward to the next 1000 beers. Happy 2012 BA! 808 charactersspinrsx, Jan 01, 2012

A: Fairly clear...a little bit of haze from the yeast that got in. Copper/amber in color. One finger white fizzy looking head. Retention is pretty solid.
S: Soft tartness. Funk. Some of the oak aging comes through a bit. Some white grape. Mostly vinegar tartness.
T/M: Massive puckering up front. A good of wine-like bozziness. Defintiely more on the bitter end of tartness. Not as sweet as some other sours. Some bready malt character. More white grape and oakiness. Fizzy and creamy at the same time on the palate. Medium-thin bodied. Finishes on the dry side for sure.
O: A great sour. Really deserves all the accolades. More bitter than sweet and finishes nice and dry. A real treat to get to try this finally. 770 characterskbuzz, Dec 31, 2011

The bottle spewed foam within two seconds of opening. Whoops! I guess it still needed time to settle after the trip home. There was still plenty of bubbly head that's typical of the style. Excellent color to this brew which must be due to the cherries: an opaque red amber.
The nose is full of sour cherries. It's difficult for me to detect any of the barrel. A very inviting smell, none the less.
The taste matches the nose almost exactly - lots of sour with some supporting cherry and even some sour apple. The big sour notes are not overwhelming, but they do hide the alcohol very well. The brew's 7% is not detectable at all, which is most impressive.
The feel is thin, but closer to medium, and tingles the entire tongue with carbonation. The finish is dry and crisp with lingering sour.
This is an excellent example of the style. It's drinkability comes from sour cherries that are just powerful enough to hide the alcohol, but not strong enough to shock the palate. 1,044 charactersTotallyHosed, Dec 30, 2011

Look: the beer pours a golden-orange color with a nice head
Smell: Tart, wine, cherries and wood.
Taste: Sourness up front (lemon like), followed by a nice cherry sourness with a musty dry oaky finish.
Mouthfeel: thin body and medium-high carbonation
Overall: A nice sour although outclassed by Cantillon or 3 Fonteinen. For obvious reason (from a microbiological point of view) the balance and complexity of artificial inoculated sours is always much lower compared to the real air-inoculated Belgium sours, but besides that, this is the best of the rest. 598 charactersrvdoorn, Dec 30, 2011

Smells a bit of cherry, straw, some sour funk but not overpowering.

Batch 008
Poured a slightly hazy sunset orange with a finger of bright white fizzy white head... Quickly disappeared after a few seconds.
The initial aroma I get is straight Brett funk and it is glorious. Once passed the funk I got great notes of cherries, green apples and a little oak on the back end. Acidic sourness stings the nostrilS.
The taste starts off sour and ends funky. Sour cherries, sour grapes, subtle wine characteristics and a little wood all rounded off with the funk.
Light in body with an abundance of carbonation... Very crisp. This beer fizzes up in my mouth with each sip. Drying tart aftertaste. The sourness lingers on the sides of my tongue after each sip.
Overall, this was a delicious beer. Once this beer has a chance to open up it really blossoms into a complex treat. 949 charactersdcloeren, Dec 28, 2011

A - Pours a hazy reddish orange with a one-finger, bubbly off-white head. Head dissipates rather quickly. Not much lacing. Copious amounts of carbonation could be seen shooting up the sides and center of the glass. Some sediment floating around.
S - What a pleasant aroma. Funky barnyard aromas from the Brett and an acidic sourness hit the nose. A tartness from the cherries is apparent. The barrel aging leaves a noticeable mark as well. Vinous qualities from the pinot noir along with some oak linger in the background.
T - Taste is just a pleasant. A wave of tartness from the sour cherries overcome the palate. Grape tannins and vinous elements break through midway to break up the tartness a bit. A lactic sourness combines with some Brett funk to finish it out. No mistaking here: this beer is tart and sour.
M - Crisp, light body with tons of prickly carbonation. A dry finish that left me wanting another sip. Very easy beer to drink, even for the tartness level. 
O - Top notch. Vinnie and Russian River know how to make an outstanding beer. The pinot noir barrels and cherries really bring something special to this beer. Not just one of my favorite sours but one of my beers period. This one is not for someone trying to break into sours but an absolute must try for someone who appreciates the style. I just wish this beer wasn't so expensive. 1,410 charactersMahlik, Dec 27, 2011

A- Pours an off red. Large white head forms on the bottle. Numerous fizzy bubbles can be seen going to the surface. The head dissipates and forms a frothy film along the top.
S- Grapes and cherries. Definitely reminds me of the smell of wine. 
T- I've only had a few sour/ wild ales but this one takes it. Initially I get a bit of an alcohol taste which sharply turns sour. The sour taste leads back to grapes and cherries.

The beer pours a very clear red brown with a lovely white head that turns into a thin film over the top of the beer.
The aroma in mostly sour but present is a little bit of fruitiness. 
The beer starts of sweet and quickly moves to a sour semi-sweet somewhat funky finish.
Overall the beer is okay. I have not had a lot of sours so it is hard to rate it against other beers in its style. However, as a beer for special occasion it will not stand out in my memory compared to a lot of the beers that I have had. 545 charactersLeeryLeprechaun, Dec 25, 2011

Aroma is tart, sour and funky with a nice white grape touch.
Taste starts out sour and funky with lots of citric notes. Sour cherries and grapes appear in the middle. Finishes very sour and astringent.

Appearance - More red than brown. The color of a dark sherry. Huge head that seems to climb the sides of the glass and cling for dear life. A soft pillow protects the body from the elements.
Smell - The tart fermented cherry aroma is most prominent. Some brett aromas as well. Not terrifically funky. Huge pinot aroma.
Taste - Starts off with a threatening tartness that fades and suddenly returns with a vengeance in the finish. The cherries come through most in the front. Behind the cherries the pinot flavors push through with some tannins and oak flavors. The tartness almost overwhelms the wine in the finish, but as the sour notes fade, the wine shines through. To be honest, I'm not sure I love how strong the wine is, but for right now it's awesome.
Mouthfeel - Light bodied and tinglingly carbonated. Very dry in the finish with the tannins from the oak and wine extending the finish.
Overall - Really spectacular. I don't get to drink many sours as good as this one. I can't wait to try the Beatification in my cellar. It tempts me every day. Is there anything Russian River doesn't do well? 1,245 charactersAlieniloquium, Dec 24, 2011

Poured a hazy reddish hue with a frothy full finger of head which reduced quickly to a thin splotchy layer. I loved the columns of constant tiny bubbles rushing to the surface. It truly appeared as if my glass was alive! There was lots of great sour smell; I caught funky yeast, apple cider vinegar, cherry, and a little bit of general booziness. Very tart taste, which was totally to be expected and what I had anxiously hoped for. I tasted the brett in action (funky!), as well as the cherries and lots of bitter and sour. Also felt like like i tasted a sour apple/pear kind of thing in there. The mouthfeel was perfect- lots of crisp carbonation from the bottle conditioning which gently foamed on my tongue.
All in all, another great Russian River experience and a very satisfied customer! Sours are definitely an acquired taste, but this is among the best of the best. Definitely lives up to the hype, IMO. 1,047 charactersshangwang, Dec 24, 2011

A - cloudy orange/copper sunset, one finger off white beautiful head with tiny bubbles that look like diamonds and a little bit of lacing
S - cherries, a young bottle of red, sweet candy sugar, lots of yummy oak, very yeasty, maltiness, soil and an all around awesome funk
T - sour funky yeast, tight Pinot noir, lots of oak, tons of grain, sweet notes on the back end, tons of cherries, candy sugar, lemon grass and tons of minerals and terrior
M - full bodied, medium acidity, great balance, nice complexity and long finish
D - this is as refreshing as it is interesting. This is something different, but in the most awesome way possible. They aren't kidding when they say "sours" when it comes to this one. But with the wine, cherries and a great sweet back end it is a beer once you have you'll crave again and again
Final thought - at $12 a pop and a nice 7% abv this is a great beer. Hard to find at times, but if you do find one, buy one and age it as well 992 characterswhatthehull, Dec 20, 2011

Pours a hazy light copper/ruby color with a slightly pink, off white head. Cherry and oak on the nose with potent lactic sourness. Slight earthiness and vanilla on the aroma as well. This batch of draft is not as intensely sour as other bottles I've had. Cherries are a little fruiter and tart, and overall the flavor is sweeter.

Batch 005x4 - Brewed 2009, bottled May 2010
A: A lovely amber ale pours from the bottle and falls under a finger of taupe foam of fine nature. The foam settles into a solid, thick sheet of the same. Sandy, spotty lace. Excellent clarity. Looks both rustic and inviting. (4.5)
S: What jumps out at me immediately is how much this smells like a Flanders Red now, oak and cherry hues over an apple cider vinegar intonation. There's a tannic characteristic in the nose as well. There's a slight grassy funk which is woven into the tart and woody characteristics quite well. Although there is much going on here, I find the nose a little too delicate. (4)
T: Tart with cherries so dominant. I am very, very surprised on how pronounced the cherry is here. It is followed through with oak, dry grapes, and interesting canned spinach flavor. I'm noting an umami/leather flavor as well. Complex, intriguing. There's a bitter undertone that is just bitter enough to impress me to reserve appreciation for the other flavors, but just as I start to get annoyed, it seems fleeting, and I almost seek out the bitterness to help clean the medium of my tongue. The tart aspect of the beer is inhibited by this bitterness in so much as it accentuates the character and marries the other nuances of the beer together. Seriously, this is really, really well blended beer. Impressive. (4.5)
M: Medium bodied and lively foam conspire to a really velvety feel and as this roams my mouth, I think it will dry it out. Upon swallowing and exhaling, my mouth is simply wet and the notes are warmed via alcohol and blossom back through the mouth. Really nice feel here. I'm hard pressed to think of what I would change here, can't think of a thing, a hard earned 5 here. (5)
O: I am struggling to think of another beer in this particular style I prefer to this one. I am calling this a Flander's Style, and I am only considering one other in the realm that competes for me: Dissident. And only time will tell if the '11 batch will meet expectations. I really enjoy this beer. And although I'm not likely to go out of my way to find it as much, I would likely grab some next time I see it on the shelves. (4)

Batch 005x3 - '09, bottled May 2010
A: Beautiful blood orange color. Light and sandy lemon foam atop ale - two fingers which last for-ev-er. (4.5)
S: The smell of this burst out the bottle as the cork came out. Sour apple, cherry, farm funk, and grain all balance so beautifully I struggle to understand the process of developing this type of complexity in a beer. Goddamn gorgeous. (5)
T: So sour. Deliciously sour. So much going on here, I'm not going to waste time trying to articulate. (5)
M: Lovely carb tone with great latitude when gliding over the palate and I get to savor every. last. drop. (4.5)
D: Don't ever NOT drink this beer. (5) 2,897 charactersharrymel, Dec 14, 2011

S – Dry tart cherry. Relatively soft.
T – A smooth body and prickly carbonation pave the way for a tidal wave of tart, unripe white peach, tanniny fruit pits, and dried leaves. The sourness somehow manages to be both bracing and restrained; pushing your palate to the edge, but not over it.
M – Medium frame with a nice smoothness. Dry finish.
O – A great, uncompromising, sour. 440 charactersvfgccp, Dec 13, 2011

a:murky red and orange. Looks like there is a good level of carbonation. Minimal head that fades quickly. 
s: tart sour cherries, some citrus in there. Can tell there will be a good level of acid.
t: cherries up front. there is vanilla and oak in there. Good level of souriness in there without being overpowering and taking away from the cherries.
m: good carbination on the tip of your tongue at the beginning. It's not thin, but not syrupy either.
This beer is world class. Perfect amount of tartness and I am a sucker for cherry beers. 636 charactersShumania, Dec 13, 2011

375ml cork and caged bottle a little above fridge temp poured into a snifter. batch 006x1.
pours out a hazy deep red, amber/brown color. some sediment visible. a very nice fizzy off white 2 finger cap of foam off the pour that left a super creamy thick layer. nice lace as well. looks great.
big funk and sour fruit in the aroma. musty, barnyard funk, old leather, lots of tart lemon, tart sour cherries. a touch of vinegar. bits of alcohol noticable as it warms.
the first sip was initially super, mouth-puckering sour. your palate quickly adjusts. tart, sour lemons battle with sour cherries. musty funk as well as maybe some lactic funk. white wine flavors towards the finish, then a nice malty base really brings it home. some oaky, wine like tannins are noticable at times.
enamel striping intense sour, love it. lingers forever with a sour candy thing goin on. bright, bubbly carbonation. effervescent. 
really a top notch sour. this could almost go for a flanders red. tons of sour, lemons, wine, cherries, the perfect amount of funk...whats not to love? 1,104 charactersdogfishandi, Dec 05, 2011

Poures a purplish magenta with a thin white head that dissipates to just form a crown around the glass of pure white bubbles. I've never seen a beer with the depth of color this one has, ever. 
The nose is the best part. You immediatly get the sour, funky characteristics but they're all bound together with this extremely prominent red wine characteristic. Tons of oak, slight vanilla, and a not-too-well hidden tartness. Amazing what's going on here. 
The taste is a journey on it's own. Initially when I sip this beer there is a wonderful red wine characteristic married with the oakiness that lends an almost sweet tone to the beer but then the tartness from the bugs takes over and just enhances the previous flavors amazingly without the sweetness getting out of control. Finishes extremely dry. Perfect carbonation. 
Like I said, what else can you say about Supplication or Russian River as it is? They're super hyped and deserve that hype. Supplication is probably the best American Wild Ale in existence. I need to buy this by the case. So in love. 1,272 charactershippityhops85, Dec 05, 2011

Batch 005X2
Pours a deep brown color, light around the edges, with a billowy white head that settles to a thick layer. Very clear, with bubbles rising to the surface, the amber/brown color is very cool.
Smell is extremely pungent, all tart and sour. There's lots going on, but a fruity, white wine character dominates. Complex, with more alcohol kick than you might expect, and very good.
Taste is exactly what you'd expect from the smell, super sour and tart, it almost numbs your tongue. The flavors are light, a little fermented fruit that is again very wine-like. The finish is tart and a little sweet, with a pleasant, drying aftertaste. It's been in the cellar for over a year, but does not have much for an aged quality.
Mouthfeel is awesome, just the right amount of carbonation to set off the sourness.
Drinkability is good, but the tartness builds after awhile. The lower abv helps the lightness.
Overall, a great beer that is exceptionally well made. Get some if you can. Thanks to david131 for the bottle. 1,042 charactersBMoney575, Dec 04, 2011

Batch 007
A - Pours a surprisingly clear, burnt umber brown, similar to the color of an Autumn landscape after the leaves change. It slowly builds a 2-fingered, off-white head with nice retention, especially compared to previous Russian River sours I've had. After it fades, it leaves behind a thick, half-finger cap that is continously fueled by numerous streams of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. The lacing is sticky at times, but it quickly recedes back into the rest of the beer.
S - The nose is full of tart, ripe cherries and a mild amount of grapes as well. A tannic oakiness comes through as well, but it's smooth and leads to a pleasant vanilla aroma. There is a slight amount of vinegar, but it is subdued and kept in check by the other notes.
T - Immediately, the palate is hit with a rush of sourness. It is a little strong at first, but the mouth acclimates quickly and it is very nice. The cherries take the forefront of the taste and they are complex, tart, and pitted. The barrel sneaks in shortly after this, giving it a different turn. I'm actually surprised by how much the oak and vanilla comes through, and the entirety of the beer revolves around this sparring of flavors. It does give it a vast complexity and is very enjoyable.
M - Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with decently high carbonation. It's mouth-puckeringly sour at first, but quickly shifts to a cheek-stinging tartness. The tannins last on the palate, which is exemplified by the crisp, dry finish.
D/O - Drinkability is high. This is one of the best Russian River sours I've had and part of that has to do with how complex and smooth it all is. It's easy to distinguish the fruit, the barrel, and the bugs that went into making this, and the final result is a delicious sipper that I am thankful for! 1,890 charactersnhindian, Dec 04, 2011

I like the faitnly hazey ochre color to this brew. Two finger, bone colored head that recedes to a nice thick film of foam. Bubbling is unimpressive.
The aroma is a tart, cherry hint added to a sherry wine through and through. Add some young, Granny Smith apple skins to that as well. The malt bill has only a little whole grain white bread crust to the aforementioned aroma. I do seem to get a soft woddy not here and there as well. There seems to be a smokey note slinking around as well. 
I taste super ripe cherry pie, crust and filling. Then tart, viney toasted Wonder bread crust and slightly fermented wine grapes. 
The palate has no indication of aging in my opinion. Except for maybe this beer would more tart if it wasn't aged. 800 charactersscruffwhor, Dec 02, 2011

Pours out a semi murky brown tinged amber, no head, yet paradoxically has a semi spritzey carbonation as also typical in a great sour. The wine aroma really does come through on the nose, full of bold fruity sour cherry character on a base of tannic wood aroma, just about everything I want out of a sour nose all at once somehow delivered without being cloying or overwhelming at all. I think I may be seeing why this beer has developed such a cult following. Tastes of sour candied cherries and than everything I experienced within the nose coming at me just like clockwork in exactly the same order, only difference being that the pucker of the acidity fades out only to be replaced by the wood tones accentuated in the finish. Very much on the gentler (yet paradoxically also the drier) side of most wild ales that I have sampled as of this date. The body is medium thick and not as astringent as it could have been, job well done! 1,057 charactersWastingFreetime, Nov 26, 2011

I have split on Russian River for a while. On the one hand, I have been seeking their stuff out and looking forward to trying it - it is universally regarded as an awesome brewery with a lot of unusual beers. On the other hand, there is a part of me hoping I don't like their stuff. Nothing against the Russian River brewery. Russian River loyalists, on the other hand....well, let's just say, from reading posts, this is the one brewery where the most loyal fans clearly believe if you're not drinking Russian River, you might as well be drinking superheated yak piss. 
Split into 2 pint glasses. First mark against this beer: It's too damn expensive. I believe I paid $6 for a 12 oz. There are plenty of damn good beers that can be had for $2-$4. But that's not what reviewing's about. 
The pour is an inert amber, with some carbonation but in general just sort of sits apathetically in the pint.
The smell has a lot of vinegar, and a whacked-out, overall tart smell. It smells to me like skunked beer, intentionally skunked in the right hands. It isn't foul, very intriguing, good smell.
The taste is absolutely pucker-worthy. Sour cherry? Sour grapefruit? Sour grape? Can't pick it out. No matter. Love. 
Bang-bang accurate carbonation, the sour has generally rendered this a sipper, but RR gets the consistency right on.
I hate to validate all the RR boobs out there, but this is a great beer. Really enjoyed this. At this price I could not drink Supplication daily without liquidating my 401k, but I will seek out other RR wilds and would periodically by Supplication again. 1,680 characterslurpy1, Nov 26, 2011

A: The ultra-tight cork finally gives way with a satisfying pop, and the beer pours a bright cherry-brown body underneath a solid inch of ultra-fine, creamy pinkish-tan foam. Strong retention but only faint, spotty lace. Lovely.
S: Hugely vinous aroma, with classic Pinot notes of earthiness and strawberries lying atop some tannic oak, sour cherries, barnyard, and straight lactic sourness. A somewhat dry, acetic undercurrent keeps things from being truly spectacularly juicy, but definitely keeps the fruit from threatening to be too sweet. As it warms the grape and cherry aspects become more prominent (which I find welcome). Excellent.
T: Tart cherries are right up front, but quickly give way to a huge wave of lactic sourness. Once this subsides the barrel components come into play nicely, with strawberry, grape, earthiness, spice and tannic oak all adding distinct notes of complexity on the way to a long, dry, vinous, and supremely sour finish. If anything I'd rather the sourness be dialed back just a touch so as to let the fruit and barrel nuances be more prominent. Still, it's nothing short of amazing - particularly the oaky, earthy aftertaste. Yum.
M: Soft medium body with plenty of ultra-fine effervescence. Delightful.
O: This is a terrific wild, no doubt about it. No aspect of it wowed me enough to push it into A+ territory, but it's as close as you a beer can get while still falling short. I'm going to have to try this alongside Rosso sometime to see how they compare, since they are by far the two most wine-like beers I've ever had. The tannic dryness of this beer's finish makes me feel like I've absolutely been drinking wine. Cool.

This is my second ever bottle of supplication, pretty much my favorite thing ever. 
Head dissipated quickly. The nose is incredible. Funk and cherries. The cherries return in the taste along with a faint oak turning tart and finishing dry and almost sweet. It's amazing how the cherries persist throughout without being over the top like a lindeman's. The effervescence sends the beer across my tongue but dries out quickly to leave just a hint of cherries. This is an amazing beer: nuanced and tasty. 534 charactershelmstreet, Nov 23, 2011

Smells of cherries, obviously. The first taste if of cherries followed by sour. The sour is not overdone. Quite a nice brew and if you like sour cherries, it's worth seeking out. 301 charactersbwmichaud, Nov 22, 2011

On tap poured into a 10oz goblet. Pours a reddish amber in color with no head whatsoever and no sediment. Smell is faint but of mild vinegar and sweetness. taste is of potent vinegar and oaky vanilla. A little bit of cherry coming through not much tho. Not much lingering at all. Love sours and this is one of my favorites! 378 charactersJustinMatthew, Nov 20, 2011

Poured from the bottle to a tulip glass.
Pours a nice deep redish brown with orange hues when up to the light. I got a one finger head from a pretty vigorous pour that then disappears to nothing with no lacing.
Nose is bright with fruit, candy sugars, tart apple, cranberry defiantly a little yeasty funk, and a hint of oak. 
Flavor defiantly shows off the tart cherries. I get some nice sour apple, and cranberry but it has an interesting fresh fruit juice in the middle. I can defiantly pick up on some oak. 
Mouthfeel is pretty nice, almost a cider like feel with a medium high level of carbonation. I defiantly get a nice lingering bitterness and tartness. 
Overall an awesome brew. Really complex but very well balanced. I Love a good sour and this has topped them all so far!
Thanks Baldo! 850 charactershdelavega, Nov 19, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 007. 375 mL corked bottle bought for $11.99 at Cork n Bottle in Monument, Colorado. 
The body of this beer is beautiful crimson-brown and clear, initially full of large bubbles (no head) and after a few minutes settling down to a number of tiny streams of bubbles rising to the surface.
Lacto/pedo wine-like notes paired with cherries are the forefront aromas in the nose, followed by a subtle brett character and possibly a touch of oak. Less complex on the nose than I expected.
Unexpected in the flavor department. Instead of full fledged sourness and cherries, the flavor of this ale takes a different route. Initially there is tartness and a touch of sour, but quickly sweet cherries show through. Right after the sweet is a wash of brett and slight funkiness, at this point the flavor is really getting good. To top it off, an interesting honey malt flavor arrives and brings the whole experience to a conclusion. This pronounced malt flavor is not quite like anything I have had in a wild ale, and sets this beer apart. Overall less bold than I expected.
The mouthfeel is on the dry side (however the flavor is fairly sweet) with ample (but not excessive) carbonation. Medium bodied.
Conclusion: Not what I expected, but very tasty and complex. I always thought this would be more sour and singular, with bracing sourness and a real smack of cherries. Instead it is softer and presents its flavor profile a gentle touch. The flavors are defined and layered, and overall this is just a great beer. 1,514 charactersallforbetterbeer, Nov 19, 2011

4.95/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Russian River "tion" glass. Batch 008.
Appearance - Opens with a very loud pop. As it is being poured it is fizzing up with very large bubbles to leave a finger of solid foam that is of an off white slightly reddish hint. The beer is a dark golden red with dark honey orange hue. The head is gone within a minute or two and there is only a thin layer of white at the top.
Smell - Sour woody cherries, fresh raspberry juice, sweet red berries, some hints of sour pinot barrel, and lots of complexity.
Taste - Sour cherries on the top of the mouth, lots of carbonation for a crisp cider like taste with some of the oak barrel showing through. Very carbonated, leaves a slightly fresh juice feel after a couple of minutes and the sourness is still evident minutes later as it has a very long aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel - Great mouthfeel of sourness dominating with the bitterness making for a good pucker. There are also feelings of the fresh sweeter fruits to give complexity to this highly fizzy beer. Very drinkable and easy to have another and so on.
Overall - I have had this many times on tap and in the bottle from various batches. I absolutely love this beer and would have it in my top 10 or so of beers of all time. I feel that this beer has a more sour aspect to it in the bottle and is more carbonated than when served on tap. One of my favorites so it's nice to always have this around in bottle and also to get it on tap for only 6.75 at the brewery. If you haven't had this beer make sure you try some. 1,529 charactersbkrueger, Nov 17, 2011

Appearance is a red brown body with a small tan head. Its` nose contains cherry, red wine and a general sourness. Supplication has a taste of of more cherries, sour apple, funk and some oak. The mouthfeel of it has some life to it, a very nice crispness. It really has a certain wine/champagne quality to it. This was another very good wild from RR. When I find myself in Philly, its` always a treat to try something from this brewery. 469 charactersmltobin, Nov 17, 2011

3.73/5  rDev -17.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip, this was burnt orange in color. I let just a little of the sediment in it (how I like it). Yeasties floating throughout. Head was fizzy, and didn’t last for long. 
Smelled tart and fruity with some maltiness hiding in the back. 
Sourness hits your first, but it’s a nice level of sourness that doesn’t overwhelm (as long as you’re into sours a little). Snappy tartness gives way to a soft sourness and noticeable notes of red wine (probably from the pinot noir barrels it’s aged in). Faint wood notes as well as barnyard yeast. Puckering tartness lingers. It’s assertive but doesn’t smack you in the face. 
Crisp and dry mouthfeel. 
Went well with olives. Would go well with funky cheese. 
Overall it was enjoyable. The sourness is strong but not too much. Any more sour and I would have had problems. I think the wine-note crossover is done well. But I still don’t like spending $10+ on a small bottle. Because of the price I probably wouldn’t buy it again if I came across it in CA. It’s nice to have once, though. 1,062 charactersjbertsch, Nov 16, 2011

Appearance - Color is a little amber and crimson with very little head.
Aroma - Cherries, smells a lot like the pinot barrels.
Tast - Tart more like wine/champagne.
Mouthfeel - Fine bubbles like champagne.
Overall - I personally feel like its to hybrid of Wine/Champagne/Beer. I guess I dont like Pinot because I really like the Dupont more that this highly ranked choice from Russian River.
I dont think I will invest another $12.50 for this Sour.

375 mL bottle poured into snifter glass.
2012 vintage, batch unknown; tapped at Hollingshead Deli (Orange, CA) on 20-Feb-12
Poured into tulip glass.
Softer side of being sour w/ nice balance of acetone and sourness. Definitely pick up the cherries and the wine presence from the oak barrels.
Overall, this is the standard cherry/wine sour that I gauge all others of similar type. This one's nearly flawless. 456 charactersRollzroyce21, Nov 14, 2011

4.17/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4After having two bourbon barrel aged brews, I decided to wipe my palate clean with this crazy concoction. 
A- Deep raspberry look. Amber and strawberry hues. Very "pretty" looking beer. 
S- Fruity, and ever so funky! Brett aroma is apparent. Sour cherries, dry oak. Leather, sweaty socks, band aids, barnyard horseblanket you name it. Great aroma.
T- Pickles??? Anyone else get this? Sour pickles. The beer itself is mouth puckeringly sour. Bitingly sour cherry pits. Under the sour is a lot of funk. Hay, straw, and horseblanket. Very acidic and lactic. 
M- Puckering of course. Light to medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. Despite the intensity I could drink a few of these.
O- This is the first sour I've tasted that really blew my palate apart. I'm hard pressed to try and find something more intense than this. This beer is a game changer . Great offering from RR . 889 charactershaazer, Nov 14, 2011
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 007. Opens with a loud pop of the cork. The color of this beer is dark gold with a subtle reddish tint. It's cloudy with a bit of yeasty sediment sitting at the bottom of the glass, some rises to the top and speckles the massive off-white head, which has terrific retention. Guess I poured it a little too hard. Lace is sticky and sudsy. 
Tart and sour aroma, with cherry notes detected a foot away from the glass, and I don't have a very good nose at all (allergies). Very tangy, fruity zip with tannic, wine-like qualities. Delicious and strong flavor, complex, quite tart and sour with a nice cherry presence. Light sweetness offsets the intense sourness a bit, but it's still strong. Yeasty. Alcohol definitely present in the taste as well; you can tell this isn't a soda.
Nicely carbonated, giving it life on the tongue. Long, lingering finish full of puckering sourness. Very refreshing. Kind of a super-sour, alcoholic cherry soda. Just excellent. I drank the first half of the bottle alone then finished it alongside a spicy italian hero sandwich and it was a nice pairing, the tart beer cutting into and combining well with the fatty meats, cheeses, and pickled cherry peppers. 
I don't know how often I'll buy this one as it costs nearly 15 bucks a bottle on the East Coast but definitely worth a try! 1,320 characterstobelerone, Nov 08, 2011

A: No head to speak of. Champagne bubbles, but with a darker amber hue. 
S: The acidity is even in the nose. As I love sours, I love this characteristic. The oak is definitely front and center as well. 
T: The taste easily overwhelms the nose. Sour, sour, sour. Oak, sour cherries, cabbage patch kids sour. Acetic and acidic, wondrous. Love it! As good as it gets. As delicate and refined as it gets.
M: Very light and tingly. Like a fine champagne, but much better.
O: As good as a sour gets. 619 charactersHeavenisbeer, Nov 07, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Supplication Batch 006X1. 375ml bottle into Duvel tulip.
Appearance: 4
Brassy brown red body with 1’ white head that slowly dissipates to nothing. Mild faint lacing. 
Smell:4
 Definite sour aroma with notes of lemon, minimal dark fruit, and faint funkiness. Not really barnyard smelling though as I thought it might be. Also a slight toffee note of sweetness, I imagine from the malt.
Taste: 4.5
A great sour with amazing balance. It’s definitely a moderate-strong sourness, but the overall profile seems so refined. It’s not harsh or caustic, but instead very pleasant. Get a mild almost woody funk with notes of lemon/citrus, presence of pinot noir grapes as well as faintest of sweetness of the malt. Lingering sour aftertaste with touch of malt and bitterness. Nice crisp, bright mineral presence in sour component, like a good white wine; this really adds a nice level of complexity to the flavour
Mouthfeel: 4.5
So delightfully sour, but again somehow balance. Great champagne-like soft, fine carbonation that leads to almost pillowly sensation. Mild thickness. Perfect amount of slimily acidic feeling ( which sounds weird I know, but seem spot-on appropriate). I really love how this beer feels actually.
Overall: 4.5
A surprising, subtle, well balanced beer that is definingly sour, but in the same breath incredibly balanced. It’s a little different than I anticipated, much less in-your-face. But really its just such a good beer.
I wasn’t 100% sold of sour beers before this, but now I am. It was just so enjoyable. In fact, super easy drinking and I was very quick to finish it, wishing I had more. 
Must Try Recommendation. 1,656 charactersEnemyWithin, Nov 05, 2011
4/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412.68oz bottle, Boulevard tulip, batch 7. 
What is this? This copper tinted pink red liquid evokes pale ale, its color like apple-cranberry juice isn't as dark as one might think cherries and pinot noir barrels would lend. The head is reserved, a creamy light brown ring. If the sediment is avoided it is ringingly clear. 
First and foremost is happy light pear and green apple. Moderate tannic oak leads the way towards the funk underneath that I have not the familiarity to pick out bug by bug. Warmth is clearly needed to see more of the many facets with my nose. Just a hint of the coming sourness and rotted wood, old damp, musty, dirty wool blankets (now I understand horse blanket), vanilla.
Sharp lemon juice, damp, musty, saddle blanket, wood tannins, and almost a rose grape character. The pucker factor is moderate to high with a really funky backend rather than a laser beam of sourness. 
I find mouthfeel to be relatively unimportant in a beer like this. I'm thinking so hard about the other stuff that I don't pay as much attention. I find a fairly thin, highly carbonated feel works best in these acidic beers, the funk feels like it provides a thickness to balance. This beer is almost moderate bodied, with moderate fizzy carbonation, and a lot of tannins. 
To me this is a super funky beer, though I must admit not as groundbreaking as I had built it up to be. Maybe I don't know sours enough to appreciate the nuance, but I can appreciate the care taken to craft it and balance it. It's sour but not too sour, complimentarily oaked, and definitely quality. 1,580 charactersbrewerburgundy, Nov 05, 2011

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Special thanks to Chowdahead for sharing this one. Cellared for a year, then poured into a snifter. Reddish brown in color, not much head or lacing. Nose is tart cherries, apple, and some sweet sugary notes. Taste is mix of tart cherry and sour apple with a little brown sugar in the mix. Never thought I would become a fan of sours, but the Allagash releases got me hooked, and this one takes the cake as my favorite thus far. Mouthfeel was smooth and not overly sour. Looking forward to trying some more sours from Russian River. Top notch. 542 charactersElGallo, Nov 02, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5First had: on tap at Monk's, Philly, PA
Russian River never disappoints, so it seems. Just tremendous all over the place, and it's so hard to pick a favorite from them. That said, there's a good possibility that Supplication may be my favorite Russian River brew, more so than Pliny the Younger and Consecration, both of which I really love.
Poured a crimson cherrywood color, with a creamy cap of off-white head that left a bit of streaky lacing on the tulip glass. The head dissipated mostly, but left a ubiquitous ringlet of delicate bubbles behind. Tart aroma, rich with various indistinct fruits, and classic Brett-ness; woody, with some nice funk. Incredibly complex taste: starts out tart and sour, with notes of cherries, cranberries, lemons!!! and white wine; mellows out mid-palate with a distinct mustiness that allows the woody characters to come out, then a fruity reprise in the end with dried cherries and dried pineapple, for a solid crisp finish. Not heavy in the mouthfeel, but definitely full on the palate. Beautifully crafted, and highly drinkable. 1,071 charactersRifugium, Oct 31, 2011

This is from bottle batch 006.
Ruby. Crimson. Beautiful deep reddish-brown when swirled in some light. Mellow, light brown head, thin and faint in retention. 
smells of mild oak wood, sweet tart, smoke, mild pepper, raspberry/cherry. pungent stench in general with a little stinky cheese funk, like a goat brie.
sooo goood. good god, man. lemon and berry tartness. sooo tart. a faint amount of something smoky and oaky, then tart again. it just tickles the sides of your cheeks. fruit, barrel, funk, fresh. damn.
easy drinking. with how sour this beer is, and after the initial tart-shock, it's amazingly smooth. love in a glass. sheer love. 
absolutely fantastic. i hear a lot of complaints about the pricing on this one--14.30 total for mine--but it's unique and exquisite, and sitting on a glass for an hour ingesting its complexities is worth any 6- or 4-pack or anything in the vein of being more economical in comparison in that same frame. it reflects the wildly fermented lambics and guezes of belgium with a twist of sonoma homeland love. it's pure insanity that this beer could serve as an introduction to "sours," all the while standing head and shoulders among most others toward which it'd lead you. beauty.

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle, batch 7.
Kind of a cherry-brown color. Small head gone quickly, without lacing. Somewhat bubbly.
Smells of oak, grapes, green apple, brett and assorted funk. Clean and sour.
Flavor is sharply tart, with a decent vinegar-like, cheesy sourness and loaded with oak and tart fruit flavors--black cherries, grapes and green apple. I can definitely taste red wine in this, and it makes it distinctly different from a lot of other sours. Very complex, but not at all overwhelming.
Mouthfeel is clean, decently carbonated and light.
This is a great-tasting and complex beer--a good twist on the usual Belgian sour. I will certainly have this again when I can get it. I'd like to try on older batch, or age one for a while. 733 charactersmusicforairports, Oct 30, 2011

Appearance- Amber with an off white head. Little lacing. 4/5

Taste- Sour cherries with bits of malt. The sourness is not overpowering at all. As a baby sour fan (now) I really like this beer. 4.5/5

Overall - Damn good beer. As a non-sour-about-to-get-into-sour fan this is a great intro into sours. Consecration and temptation was too much for me, but this was good. 4.5/5 619 charactersMADhombrewer, Oct 30, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Golden and slightly hazy with a finger of head and steadily streaming bubbles. Light lacing is left on the glass.
Smell - Sour cherries are very prominent in the nose mixed with sour apples. Then there are wilder aromas and strong aged-swiss followed by more tart cherries.
Taste - Really big sour cherries up front followed by other sour fruit (apples and grapes). Nice vanilla oak notes bridge the gap between sour fruit and lingering acidic sourness. The influence from the pinot barrels is very obvious in this beer. Wonderful.
Mouthfeel - This was very carbonated and relatively thin. It was strikingly dry throughout the entire flavor profile which complimented the sourness extremely well.
Overall - This is far and away the best sour I have had to date. The added dimension from the pinot and the balance will be hard to be topped by another sour in my opinion. 886 characterssdmvd6, Oct 28, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation-Poured out of a 375ml bottle. Batch #007. Clearly mentions to age in a dark cool place which i do intend to do so once i buy another one. Has a nice info section on the back of the bottle explaining the roots and making of the beer. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.
Appearance-As the beer pours out of the bottle and into the tulip you can see that its a very bubbly beer. The carbonation is present as you can see the bubbles arise from the bottom of the glass. Its a nice redish, mohoghany color thats somewhat see through. I didnt seem to get much head after i poured out the whole bottle. Probably less than half an inch.
Smell-Definitley sour notes rise to the nose once you lean the glass for a good smell. Scents of aged grapes and apples engulf your nose. As the beer is described to be, you can also smell the wine. More on the side of a merlot. If you smell closely you can also smell small amounts of maybe a whiskey alcohol. 
Taste-At first sip this beer makes your face crinch kind of like if you were putting a sour gum into your mouth. One droops down and you stretch your mouth back. This beer is sour to begin and continues throughout the drink. Reminds me of a Rodenbach. Grapes are savored and green apples seem to make a presence as smelled. 
Mouthful-Its a somewhat light beer. Sits softly on the tongue. It has a crisp, bubbly feel that you get when the beer is resting on the top of the tongue. It finishes pretty clean leaving a dry feel. The alcohol form the beer seems to float to the nose to where you can smell what your drinking. The sourness continues but isnt as strong as you carry on. It does however seem to linger on the sides of the tongues. 
Overall-A good solid sour ale for sure. I would drink it again and look forward to aging one much longer. Probably around 6 months to a year. I guess i wouldnt mind if it was a little less sour but its still really good. Glad i encouraged myself to try this beer. 1,960 charactersales4baldo, Oct 27, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have now had 2 bottles of this, plus once on tap in the Russian River tap room. This review takes into account all 3 tastings.
Kind of a tangerine color split between a goblet and pint glass. Nice head, no lacing.
Hard to detect much other than the sourness on the nose.
Beer out of the bottle was very sour, but I believe this was due to serving temperature. We took it slow and really let the beer warm up and then the other flavors started to emerge aside from the sour microbes. Nice wood notes to accompany the sourness. A little bit of citrus zest, a hint of malt sweetness.
Mouthfeel was surprsingly crisp for a sour. Surprised as to the difference between a sour beer and a hop bomb treats the palate. Hops tend to linger and shred the palate, but the sour doesn't linger too long.
Overall this is a fuck of a beer. Easily one of the best offerings from Russian River. PLEASE be sure to drink this at the proper temperature. Minimum of 55F to let all the flavors emerge. 985 charactersAWolfAtTheDoor, Oct 24, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5Pours a hazy copper hue. No head. Nice scents of tart cherries with a faint sweet smell. Notes of red wine are present in the aroma, too and compliment the tartness nicely Big, but tame tartness with a decent acidic flavor. After letting this sit and stir for a while the sweeter notes come to the front. Dark cherries, diacetyl, hints of dry red wine. The carbonation definite helps the tartness of the brew, it makes it sharper. Noticeable notes of brett and diacetyl for a buttery, yet funky finish. The beer's medium body definitely helps your palate deal with the tartness and the acidity nicely so that you can enjoy the complexity rather than focus on how funky it is. Top notch. Very well balanced. 706 characters100floods, Oct 21, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5375ml caged and corked bottle, batch 04x5. My first Russian River offering, from a grocery store (sigh) in Oregon.
This beer pours a slightly cloudy, but still somehow bright copper hue, with one finger of foamy, moderately creamy pale beige head, which leaves a few broad buttes of lace around the glass in its wake. It smells of tart fruit - cherries, mostly, a mild earthy yeastiness, barnyard funk, and a bit of astringent woodiness. The taste is tart, sour cherry, some equally lemon-oriented essences, and some fruity vinegar to mix things up further. A soft graininess underlies all, softened up even more by a mild, endearing funk, part over ripe fruit, part surprisingly inoffensive cheese curds. The carbonation is quite zippy, but adequately restrained, the body medium-light in weight, and just a bit too clipped to be considered outright smooth. It finishes with that tart, increasingly nondescript sourness persisting, alongside a simmering, late-arising yeasty funk.
I like the American craft-brewing tendency of, the higher-quality the beer, the more they want to tell you about it on the packaging...Knowing what went into this offering makes it all the more enjoyable - the sourness, yeast, wood, funk (oh, and actual beer, too!), all kept in balance, yet still rendering a beverage for the adventurous palate. Sort of a more laid-back Cantillon - scary, earth-relationship-affirming, and ultimately tasty. 1,426 charactersbiboergosum, Oct 15, 2011

Batch 006x1
This brew pours a very hazy reddish amber. There is less than a fingers worth of light tan head. No legs to speak of.
The nose is pretty intense. Tart cherries, sourness, light barnyard funk, earthiness and a bit of vinegar. The alcohol is noticed just a bit.
The taste is quite sour, tart and delightful. The cherries are blended together with a crisp, tart funk that ends with a bit of vinegar and booze. A nutty taste is also present. There is a surrounding earthiness that carries the flavors wonderfully. 
The mouthfeel is crisp amply carbonated. Nice feel for the brew and is very suiting.
Overall, this brew is another great sour from Russian River. Crisp, tart, and full of flavors. Boom, I'm lovin' it! 823 charactersChugginOil, Oct 10, 2011

A- Pours a hazy amber color. Tried to leave the sediment in the bottle but a little bit got into the glass. Very thin white head. No lacing to speak of
S- Smells very tart. Getting a lot of cherry and lemon. Very funky smelling beer.
T- Starts off tart with a strong cherry flavor. Slight vinegar taste on the back end but remains a very nice cherry funk throughout.
M- Crisp yet smooth mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation
D- Awesome brew that is perfect for a late summer evening or for a perfect afternoon. Alchol is absolutely hidden by the funk and I would've never guessed this was 7%

Poured an amber, reddish color with an off-white ring of head.
Smelled of tartness, fruit, and barnyard funk.
Tasted of sour cherries, green apples, grape, and wild yeast. Bready malt provides a slight balance. However, there remains a very strong acidic profile. Sour flavor lingers. It is well carbonated, and creamy.
This is my single favorite wild ale to date. The tartness is not overpowering, but instead mingles with the fruit and malt to allow for a high level of complexity. Very recommended! 537 charactersfatmcb1, Oct 06, 2011

(A)
Pours a reddish brown with bits of copper color in the light. My pour had very little head and very fine lacing that just barely held on to the glass.

Aromas of tart fruit and funk.
(T)
The sour washes over your tongue right away after it passes the taste of sour cherries and spices is left.

S: Great combination of barnyard funk, citrusy sourness and peels of lemon and lime. Slighty sweet berry in there as well.
T: Very tart with a burst of sour lemon. Very subtle sweetness that is vine fruit in nature as well. Slight vinegar mixed in and it finishes with a funky yeast.
M: So clean and very crisp. Light bodied. It has incredible drinkability and is very refreshing.

S: Acidic, cherries, funk. The barnyard funk type smell really overpower the fruits.
T: Like the smell, the taste is more acidic and funky than fruity. The taste, however, is more balanced. A slow drinking beer for sure. Hints of breadiness, oak, Brett. Not getting a lot of vinegar, but it is present.
MF: Medium bodied, carbonated well, extremely dry finish. Not a lot of alcohol coming through.
O: Thought this was great, but well below the quality of authentic Belgians I've had. Well balanced, with a bit of a strange aftertaste. I would get it again no doubt, I just wish it was a bit less funk and a bit more cherry. 751 charactersrusswbeck, Sep 30, 2011
3.22/5  rDev -28.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3appearance: pours a cloudy brown with a two finger foamy white head that dissipates moderately. not very much lacing on the glass.
nose: bottle says that its aged in pinot noir barrels and has cherries added to it. i definitely smell both of those things. has a definite wine characteristic to it as well as a fruity cherry sweetness in the nose. smells exactly like a cherry pie. instantly brings thanksgiving to mind. that's my favorite holiday. you're cheating, supplication. it not only smells like cherries, but it has that buttery dough smell that is quite pleasant. a slight, slight belgian yeast spiciness is in the background, but it is quite subdued. This really just smells like a freshly baked cherry pie. There isn't much else, but it is amazing how much this smells like a real cherry pie.
taste: UGH! That is some sour ass shit! Tastes like the tiniest grape you ever ate mixed with hay and moldy parmesan cheese rind. I don't want any more of this. The second sip is a little more forgiving than the first, but it still is freaking sour! Why is this beer so freaking highly rated? Who seriously looks for these flavors in a beer? I mean it gets more tolerable the more you drink it, but holy crap that first sip was not very pleasant. 
mouthfeel: moderately carbonated and fairly viscous. not watery at all, but not too thick. the mouthfeel is quite pleasant and I'd imagine it is quite spot on for the style.
overall: i have found a style of beer that i have zero interest in exploring. I imagine that some beer geeks out there will love this, but for me, a sour ale is just not something i'll ever want. the flavor is decent, but not all too complex, and it is not very refreshing at all either. Glad I tried the best of the sour ales before I wasted my time with any other ones. This just isn't my cup of tea. 1,832 charactersetaggie09, Sep 28, 2011

Appearance: Aggressive pop from the cork when opened. Nice sediment found on cork...Pours a rosey, quite hazy amber color with soft white head that dissipates quickly. 
Smell: Cherry wine. Notes of vanilla, slight oak, very bright and dry cherry 
Taste: Boom. Great flavors of tart cherry, oak, and a musty Brett character to follow. Good vinegar sharpness, balanced nicely with an appropriate amount of oak. 
Mouth: Medium bodied, tart and drying. Very intriguing, and wants to be savored. 
Drink and overall: Fantastic beer. A real nice treat, that I will seek out again in the future. I've had enough to know it's worth it's weight in shipping. My mouth has a great lasting flavor that I am really enjoying, thank you VC. 828 charactersMarcatGSB, Sep 27, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. Batch 007.
Appearance: As poured from the 375 ml bottle the beer is a lightly hazed reddish cherry wood color with a 1/4 “ white head that soon recedes to a ring around the glass and a tiny layer of foam over the liquid. Sipping creates sheets of foam that quickly become scattered patches and a few legs of lacing that cling to the glass. Even as the beer is nearly gone there is still a ring of foam and some trails of lacing when sipping.
Smell: The aroma is a complex mix of tart cherries, a bit of the oak and pinot noir, some traces of the malt and some very light traces of vinegar that emerge in the background. There’s also a light touch of vanilla but minimal funk character. 
Taste: The flavors, as expected from the nose, are a complex mix of sour, tart cherries, along with some traces of vinegar. In the background are some traces of the oak and wine with a definite trace of vanilla. While this beer is too young from the bottle for there to be much funky character to the flavor, it is easy to imagine what it will be like when it has some more bottle age.
Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is on the light side of medium bodied and smooth with light but persistent carbonation. The finish is relatively long as the tart, sour cherries lead into a puckering dryness that spreads throughout the back of the mouth. This is also where a touch of bitterness shows itself in the back of the mouth before it gets lost in the tart dryness of the finish.
Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one quite drinkable in that each sip was easy to take and easily followed the preceding one. If you are looking for one word to describe this beer, think “complexity.” This is a beer that deserves its reputation and overall is an excellent beer. I’m looking forward to seeing how bottles of this one age over the next few years. 1,933 charactersdrtth, Sep 26, 2011

The pour was a shade short of crimson with nice highlights around the edge. A nice, tight cap formed on top with some staying power. Also, some nice lace was laid down throughout the glass. The nose consisted of tart cherries with accompanying funk. Taste mirrors the nose with a shot of oak. Mouthfeel was nice with a fair amount of carbonation to keep things moving. 
In the end, not something to drink everyday, but definitely a special treat that I would love goretudn to often. 520 charactersharrymattcody, Sep 25, 2011

A: Pours a beautiful hazy orange. A light stone head that's big and frothy before receding to a thin layer with a ring of creamy foam hanging around the edge. Excellent lacing, just a beautiful brew.
S: Tart, apricot and cherry. It smells spritzy, if something can smell spritzy. Malty, almost biscuity, and that funky brett of course. Cherry definitely comes out more as it warms.
T: Bam, funky tartness and dark cherry. A little sweet, malty, and woody. Finishes quite dry and clean. 
M: Very smooth, very full, I have not complaints on this one. Easily the best body on a sour I've ever had.

A: Aggressive pour leads to one finger head of tight bubbles that dissipates to a thin ring. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Beer is copper color an orangy red color...looks like the sun, firey and bright. Awesome. 4.5
S: Smell isn't all that strong....definitely smells a bit sour...slight vinegar....the smell is definitely not supplication's strong point but still its nice and changes as the beer warms. 4.0
T: Taste is supplications strong point. I love this beer. Super tart cherry flavor. Can definitely taste the barrel in this one. Taste on this one is hard to explain but bottom line is that its awesome. 4.5
M: high carbonation, super prickly like champagne. It goes down easy and leaves you wanting more. 4.0
O: Overall Supplication is one of my favorite offerings from Russian River. This beer is never disappointing and the hype around it is justified. I seek this out regularly every month or so. Thanks Vinnie for sending this awesome beer to Philly! 4.5 1,164 charactersslentz, Sep 20, 2011

Pours a nice dark cherry color w/ a one finger head that quickly disappears to a sliver. Very cloudy and alive looking brew. Good carbonation and decent lacing. Awesome looking Wild Ale. Wow. The nose is fantastic. Cherry, funk, some brown sugar, caramel, sourness, a hint of candy sweetness. Really complex and nice. Opens up really nicely with warming/airing out. Now... on to the taste. Pretty much the same as the nose, minus the candy sweetness. It's really not too sour, just about right. It seems like the taste just keeps evolving the more you get into it. Definitely some wine/oak/vinegar in the taste as well. None of the 7% ABV is evident at all. Very carbonated and dry finish on this beer. A little too carbonated, otherwise a higher score. Overall, this is a top flight Wild Ale. I like Consecration a little better, but this is highly recommended. Cheers! 881 charactersjayhawk73, Sep 18, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375mL bottle split with my brother. Batch 007.
A: the cork pops off this beast with the ferocity of champagne. Active body through the reddish hues. Thin white head leaves behind mild lace.
S: wow, sour goodness ahead! Tart fruit, cherries, funky yeast.
T/M: very actively carbonation blasts your tongue as the first wave of sour fruit approaches. Plenty of wine-like qualities to be appreciated here alongside the funky Brett yeast. I don't drink *that* many sours, so it's still kinda hard for me to describe exactly what's going on. Finishes bone dry and quite smooth.
...and then comes the aftertaste. A bitter oak barrel flavor sets in about 15 seconds after you swallow and lingers. Interesting, sure, but not really my thing.
D: 375mL split two ways is simply not enough. Russian River delivers once again! Now if only they'd ship to NYC... 852 charactersbrystmar, Sep 17, 2011
3.9/5  rDev -13.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to KevSal & gcphilli for sending this one my way!
A - pours a dirty brownish red, more brown than red
S - the nose has some cherry notes (not as much as I was hoping), mixed in with some caramel malts, and a whiff of funky Brett round it out
T - Starts off with tart, sweet cherries up front. These fade to a nice vinous flavor from the noir barrels; at the same time, I am getting nice citrus sour flavors. The brett shows up in the end, leaving some light mushroom that lingers after the exhale. It is hard to tell, but the citrus or the cherries are also on the finish. Over the top of all of this is a bit of a dry tannic vinous flavor akin to the taste that would be present about 5-10 minutes after one finishes a glass of wine.
M - a little thin throughout and finishes very dry from wine barrel treatment
D - this is a really nice, complex brew from RR. It is a very good beer, but didn't "wow" me as much as I was hoping for. It is almost like a more complex Consecration but not as powerful. That being said, this was an awesome beer, I just think it falls a little short of other Wild Ales I have had (and other RR brews for that matter). Highly recommended! 1,181 charactersbirchstick, Sep 16, 2011

A: Pours out from the bottle as good looking as anticipated. Head retention is nice as you can almost see the wildness. Dark orange, close to red with a ring of pearly white head around the glass.
S: Has the vinegar and funky presence with a lot of red wine qualities. Get a bit of that wine and beer soaked wood, leads to a bit of funk and some booze. Surprised with how much alcohol is coming off this beer. 
T: Time after time, this beer never disappoints. Sweetness and tartness blend together with some lovely funkiness. I taste Smarties strangely. The light fruit flavors along with the funk of this beer make it simply outstanding. 
M: Very highly carbonated batch, rips at the tooth enamel. Enters the palate sour, has crisp carbonation and leaves the palate with an incredible sour lasting flavor.
O: Very hard to find anything wrong with this beer, the nose is a bit boozy for some reason but it really is a world class beer. It delivers outstanding flavors and each batch seems to hit the nail on the head. 1,033 characterskiddynamite920, Sep 14, 2011

S - Funky smell. With green apples, faint grapes with black cherry throughout. Hints of oak in the aroma.
T - Sour green apple/grapes in the front, leads into a pronounced wine finish. Soft due to being pinot noir. Finish fades into a mellow oak with a touch of sourness lingering.

T- Wow! Mouth puckering, super tart, sour cherries at the start. Oak, acetic vinegar, and brett follow and the beer finishes with an astringent, lingering tart, sour cherry aftertaste. Exquisite!
M- Feel is medium with an effervescent level of carbonation which works perfectly here.

A: Pours a very dark orange, nearly ruby in color. I got a massive fluffy off-white head pouring this one. Very lively carbonation, I can already tell its zesty. Its lacing nicely.
S: Huge oak tannins, some acidity, and cherry stand out at first. Lots of bacteria and brett make this as funky as it is sour smelling. A bit sweet and lactic. Pinot still comes out really nice in the aroma. This is all coming back to me, it smells incredible.
T: Cherry is really starting to dominate at this age, the funk is coming through a lot as well. Sourness seems to be calming down a lot. Tartness and acidity are felt after the cherry subsides followed by a very dry finish from the brett and champagne yeast. All of the oaky flavors and the bug linger around on your palate.
M: Thinnish medium effervescent mouthfeel. This is very crisp with a dry finish.
O: This is what American wild is all about. Nice tartness, tons of depth, fruit, bugs, its all here. I might not claim this to be my favorite beer anymore but its still got a top 5 spot. An awesome beer. 1,092 charactersschwaeh, Sep 10, 2011

S: Cherries, good bit of funk. Smells a bit like a good shiraz, also a damp smell(don't really know how to describe that one, like a wet towel that's starting to get mildew)
T: As I've come to expect from RR sours, fantastic. Very tart, the most sour of their lineup I've had. Definitely cherries, vinegar, whole grain bread
M: Very good, really soft. Pretty thick, syrupy. The tartness gets you in the jowls and made me salivate a bit.
Overall, this one was lovely. Out of this compared to the other 2 RR wilds I've had (consecration, temptation) I'd have to put this third. Cheers to them though, never disappointed. Will definitely get again and again. 811 charactersBobheed, Sep 07, 2011

S: Yeast and ripe cherries with tart funk and strawberry sweetness.
T: Like the nose, initial hit is a very fine dark cherry taste paired with yeast that blooms into a strawberry sweetness tamed by a subtle vinegar touch. 
M: Smooth but superfluous carbonation just adds to the high quality of the beer and leaves a dry finish.

A.
Beer pours a fairly clear orange/brown color with about a fingers worth of very bubbly off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. A nice ring of head lingers around the glass as well as some decent bubbly lacing going on. 
S.
An awesome nose on this one. Sour cherries with a hint of a fruity white-wine (almost pear-like) as well as some subtle notes of barrel. I pick up more sourness than funk. All the aromas meld together so nothing really dominates the nose, which I enjoy. Each smell you can pick up something different. 
T.
Just as nose. Incredible. Sweet and tart throughout the taste. Flavors of sour and slightly sweet cherries, lemons, slight acidic/vinegar notes hit me up front before finishing off with subtle funk (more detectable in taste than nose) as well as some slight oak. Same as nose, you can pick up something new with each sip which makes this really enjoyable for me. 
M.
almost medium bodied...fairly light. Carbonation isn't too high but great for the style. Mouthfeel is slightly dry, but there is a lingering sweetness as well. 
O.
Cherry sours are my favorite sours and this one does not disappoint. Definitely one to trade for regularly. Definitely not as stellar as Lou Pepe Kriek (I love the funk!) but awesome for an American Wild IMO. 1,308 characterscetherid, Sep 05, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 375 mL bottle into a tulip. Batch 04X3, caged and corked bottle. 
Appearance: Supplication pours a deep ruby color, mostly transparent except for the yeast particles floating around. A dollop of beige foam rests on top and laces up the glass nicely.
Smell: A great balance of sour and funky. There is so much going on here. A bit of dark malt, lots of cherries, some lemon, and a nice level of funk, horse blanket and a little stinky cheese.
Taste: The brief sweetness is accompanied by tart cherries, and the flavor grows even more sour as the sip progresses. Tart, more acetic than lactic, and vinegary, totally bold without killing my palate. Each sip waters the mouth just enough to make me want to go back for more. Notes of pinot noir come in toward the end, as if this beer needed any more complexity, along with some spicy oak tannins. The finish has a nice funk to it, giving me an extra smile.
Mouthfeel: The carbonation starts with a bite but is smooth throughout each sip. A sour puckering sensation causes me to salivate without being overpowering. Lightly vinegary and acidic. A light astringency comes with the barrel but is barely noticeable. The body is on the lighter side of medium. Russian River knows my sour sweet spot. 
Overall: I cannot believe it has taken me this long to try my first Supplication. This is everything I want in a sour, I will be coming back to this beer again and again. 1,432 charactersKickInTheChalice, Sep 05, 2011

K&B Wine Cellars
San Diego, CA
A mixture of cherry red and dark auburn. Golden red edges. No head whatsoever and flat as can be. Disappointing, mainly because I've had this beer a dozen times before, and it's never appeared so flat. Oh well. I hope the rest of it doesn't disappoint!
Tart and sour aroma and lots and lots of cherries! The oak aroma is present as well, but only in the background. I love this stuff, though Consecration still ranks a touch higher.
Sweet and tart cherries, plenty of biting sourness, wood, earth, and brick provide a rich balance. Alcohol is hardly detectable. Delicious stuff.
Although the body appeared nearly flat as can be, the body is still rich and full--surprising!
One of my favorite beers of all time, even with its flaws. I'd be a happy, happy man if this were the only beer I'd ever be allowed to drink. For all I know, all they serve in Heaven is Supplication! Even though no individual aspect of this beer is the best in show, it's one of my absolute favorite beers to drink, ever. 1,054 charactersehammond1, Aug 31, 2011

Pours a bright amber/copper with a thin white head with lacing.
Cherry is the predominant smell, but also some oak and a touch of tobacco. Also some other lighter fruit smells.
Wow usually don't like sours, but this is unique like nothing I've ever had. Starts out very champagne like with just a hint of cherry and lots of oak. As it goes down, the cherry flavor brightens significantly and leaves a good pucker by the time its down. 
Fairly light mouthfeel and a very dry champagne like finish with high carbonation.
This beer is amazingly complex and delicious. Finally a sour I could drink every day and it has to be one that's expensive and comes nowhere near the midwest. I've got another coming in trade and will definitely seek this one out again. 802 charactersjmarsh123, Aug 30, 2011

M- Prickly carbonation coats the tongue. Perfect amount. So drinkable, I'm afraid this bottle (or my other 3) will not last nearly as long as they should.
O- One of my all time favorite beers. Ever since I had this with my friends at RR, it's been on of "those" beers for us. Wish it was cheaper (and easier to find), but I'll take what I can get. 750 charactersjm1229, Aug 26, 2011

Poured into a Claret...
Appearance-Amber body with a bubbly, champagne like two finger off white head. Nice retention and about a 1/3 finger head still sits atop the beer throughout the whole drink.
Smell-First thing I get is the Pinot Noir(my favorite wine). Apple, Pears, Sour cherrys. Some vinegar and a nice amount of pepper. Made me eager to dig in.
Taste-Wow. Big Oak and Sour Cherry. Pinot Noir really comes through. Light bitterness. It's amazing how simple this beer is but how amazing this beer tastes.
Mouthfeel-Extremely drinkable. Medium bodied, champagne like carbonation. Refreshing and easy to drink.
Overall-If this were available in Tx and not so expensive I would drink one every night. The sour and tartness of this beer did not fright me off like others sours I've tried. Crazy drinkable. If you can get this beer and haven't tried it yet, go get it now. 964 charactersSWMeyer4141, Aug 23, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 003. 375ml pulled from the "cellar" (dark, insulated coat closet) and chilled for 20 minutes in freezer.
Nice pop from the cork. Poured into tulip, producing a beautiful thin, creamy off-white head atop a copper colored, slightly hazy brew. Aroma of ripe cherries and wood punctuated with a good sharp dose of brett funk. Flavor is a well-rounded blend of tart cherries and saturated red wine barrel, with a lingering sweet/tart finish. Has a wonderful mouthfeel thanks to a light-to-medium body--surprisingly heavier than I remember, especially compared to recent, fresher batches I've had--and perfect carbonation with a perpetually replenishing head which leaves an impressive lacing behind. 
This is a terrific beer that has aged tremendously. I'd have to say it's my most successful cellaring experience to date. 825 charactersRzzzzz, Aug 21, 2011
3.58/5  rDev -20.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Bottle shared by Casey. Thanks man.
Pours a light amber/brown. The nose is big cherries, a yeastiness, red wine, grapes and a bit of straw funkiness. The cherries and the funkiness come together in a slightly medicinal way. Sour, tart cherries dominant the taste, intermingled with red wine, that yeastiness, a touch of grape and that straw funkiness. The body is medium but the carbonation is quite high, though it works. This isn't my favorite wild, though it is one of the better ones that is readily available. Everyone else liked it better than I did, but that is not uncommon for wilds. Solid. 600 charactersseeswo, Aug 20, 2011

Tart, crisp and fruity aroma with lots of dark berries. Mild funk. Nicely complex.
Slightly sweet upfront before giving way to underripe grapes and tart raspberries. Nice lush fruit on the back end not unlike a fine Marlborough Gewurtztraminer.
Medium-light body with moderately-high carbonation. Very good for style.
A really great wild ale with a nicely balanced and complex fruity flavour. Well built and a damn fine ale. 528 charactersdgilks, Aug 20, 2011

Pours an orangish amber color, with a white head that dissipates rather quickly. No real lacing, but it leaves a nice white ring of bubble around the edges.
Smells of oak and fresh cherries, with a crisp champagne-like nose. 
The taste is of cherries and tartness, and there is a nice caramel malt backbone that plays very nicely off of the sourness. Nice oak character ties everything together for a really stellar experience. The mouth feel is very smooth, with nice carbonation
This beer is truly incredible and is a pleasure to drink 560 charactersdannyancient, Aug 20, 2011

reviewed from notes.
Appearance: dark amber to mahoganey bodied beer with a small white head that fades quickly to nothing.
Smell: funky sour cherries with a musty smell. Oaky.
Taste: moderately sour right up front and continues throught the entire taste. Cherries! Its got the barnyard funkiness to it as well. you can taste some yeast in the back of all that sour vinegar note with a touch of barrel.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with low to moderate carbonation. 
Overall: Another nice sour from RR. 584 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 15, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I decided to open this one and share it with a few friends during one of the recent UFC fights. Bottle of Batch 4 poured into an over sized snifter.
A - Pours murky brown, with hints of ruby red around the sides, with a stark white one finger tall head leaving spotty lace down the glass.
S - Smells of tart cherries, damp basement must, light vinegar, funky brett, and some dry oak tannins. This one has aged quite nicely.
T - Starts off with lots of tart cherries up front slowly giving way to a mix of light sweetness, funky brett, strong sourness, and some must. The finish is a mix of tartness and quite a bit of dryness, lingering on the pallet for some time.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Dry, tart, feel with plenty of it lingering through the finish.
O - I still love this beer and it only seems to get better with age. I just wonder how long it can go for. If this one is any indication I would say quite awhile. 951 charactersorangesol, Aug 11, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Recently received this in a trade with pwoody11 (thanks again), and since it was the newest batch and I have some older stuff in the basement I figured it'd be worth drinking soon and adding the dregs to my oude bruin in secondary. Cracked this one open after a hearty dinner of rich beef stew. Really cut through all the rich robust flavors, though I'm glad I waited to drink it as an after dinner drink.
A: Nice auburn with your typical barrel-aged sour head, a quick pop that fades right away.
S: The bugs are present, but I'm still getting a lot of yeast character. Its certainly got an acetic punch too it, but not much of the funk I sometimes get from this beer. Sour cherries are very pronounced. There's a nice rich brown sugar sweetness in the background as well as a bit of oak character to be found. Pinot noir is kind of hard to miss.
T: A bit more funky than the nose first made me think. Lots of sour tart puckering (three adjectives, you are warned) cherry flavor. There's a strong spice not that I'm guessing is from the Pinot Noir barrels. For being sour there's enough residual brown sugar & molasses sweetness to overcome any notions of straight vinegar.
M: Lively carbonation carries this light to medium bodied beer. That said, as it warms a lot of body is lost. Due to the tartness and slight tannic nature finish is very dry. Alcohol becomes more present as it warms as well.
O: Reading over my review I keep thinking it sounds like I didn't really enjoy this one. I did, I always do. It was different than other bottles I've had, which is of course to be expected. Its not a perfectly balanced beer, but its an extremely enjoyable one that fully deserves the praise it gets. It really was a nice contrast to dinner, and I'm hoping it'll do some great things to my conditioning beer. 1,811 charactersDrazzamatazz, Aug 09, 2011

Upside-down waterfalls of violent fine carbonation bubbles. Semi translucsent orange amber body. 1/2 finger fizzy lingering off white head. LOTS of gritty black dots left in the glass at the end of the pour. Looks unappetizing. 
On the nose: Fruity champagne-like pear and cherry aromas with lots of funk and some quince rind and lemon zest. Has a mild backbone of clean, new oak.
More sour, complex, and funky on the palate than Consecration, but less balanced. Quite the sour beer. It has me in awe. Fruity red berry vinegar without the bad parts of vinegar. Consecration however is more berry-like and clean with a tamed, but still very present sense of sourness. 
Mouthfeel is light to moderate with lingering aroma that you can smell in your mouth. An interesting beer for sure. One of a kind. 845 charactersaficionado, Aug 06, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a little fizzy, with a thin head that quickly recedes. No lacing to speak of on the way down. A lot of floaty thingies are in this beer, not sure if they are yeast, pieces of the cherries, or bacteria thingies. Never seen anything quite like it. I give it props for uniqueness.
The smell is amazing. Cherry, red wine, and yeasts. Just a touch of a cough-syrup medicinal quality, but not enough to bother me.
The taste is awesome too. There's a lot going on, so here are it's qualities in order of their distinctiveness: cherries that are more sour than sweet and quite tart, carbonation bubbles, red wine, and some funky yeasts. Hops, malts, and the traditional beer metrics are sort of out of the window with this one. But I like it.
I would love to have another some day. But not sure I'd have more than one in any given sitting. So I can't say it's the most drinkable beer. 885 charactersjar2574, Aug 04, 2011

A: Dark amber, almost brown, with nice reddish hints. One & 1/2 finger head, that is very fizzy. Good retention and great lacing.
S: A light wet hay funkiness. Yeasty. Definitely some wine qualities. Grapes. Mild sour cherry aroma.
T: Not overly sour. Light cherries. More wine/grape flavors. Cherries come through much more in the finish and aftertaste.
M: Light-medium bodied. Very carbonated. Dry yet not at the same time.
O: Much better sour than others I've tried. The sourness is there but doesn't overwhelm you in any way. The cherries set it off just enough. 632 charactersdoughanson78, Aug 01, 2011

A- Pours a ruby red color with a thick white foam that leaves great lacing.
S- Red tart cherries and brett funk make up the majority of the nose. A slight sweet malt aroma is barely present.
T- All cherries and funk. Not quite Kriek cherry tartness but still very tart and very flavorful. Some slight vinegar and brown malt with a sharp acidic finish.
M- Medium/light bodied with nice carbonation. Dry and juicy at the same time. Very interesting feel.
O- This is quite a beer. Tons of flavor and a nice sourness that is a staple of many Russian River brews. 581 charactersprojectflam86, Aug 01, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 375ml bottle into Bordeaux wine glass.
Batch 006x1
Aroma: A mix of lemony tartness and cherry sweetness, with an underlying funky barnyard note. Cherry sweetness, accompanied by a vanilla character, comes to the forefront as beer warms and opens up. 
Appearance: One finger off-white head disappears somewhat quickly (but then again, this is not a style known for dense, pillowy heads of foam). The body of the beer has a beautiful clear deep reddish-brown "sun tea"-like color.
Flavor: Prominent, lip-smacking rhubarb-like tartness, which lingers through the finish. Tart red cherry, accompanied by green apple skin, and a light wild earthiness appear toward the end. At no point does bitterness appear through the clean finish.
Mouthfeel: Slight sting from the medium-high carbonation. Medium-low body. Mouth waters from delicious tartness.
Overall: A fantastic, balanced, approachable wild ale. Lots to contemplate. Barnyard character is noticeable, but not overwhelming. Aroma presents a cherry-like sweetness while the taste of the beer is tart overall. I highly recommend this one for both the sour novice, who's trying to expose their palate to these types of beers, and also for the aficionado! 1,219 charactersmdvatab, Jul 31, 2011

55°F
Batch No. 005X1
A: Cloudy deep oxidized copper body topped with one finger of loose pink-tan head that quickly dissipates leaving light bubbles of lace and a thin cover.
S: Cherries, leather, and a slight acidic funk. No hop presence.
T: Very light fruit flavors up front, cherry in particular, giving way to an unmistakable acidic twang. Lactic, with no detectable acetic. Despite the fruit character there is almost no sweetness, and the acidity hangs on the tongue long after the sip.
M: Light to medium body with heavy carbonation that bites the tongue immediately. Acidity prickles and the palate is left bone dry. 
O: Really solid sour. Not something I would consider a session choice, but very interesting. Excellent with food, and a something I would spend the money on again in the future. 840 charactersdpnelson1978, Jul 30, 2011

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Rusty, cloudy, a brownish murkiness almost caramel hue
N - Very tart, unripe cherries, raspberries, freshly picked fruit, vinous, tart puckering stone fruit to maybe even blackberries wraps around a nice wafting barnyard wet hay, mossiness; smattering of Belgian like spiciness like peppercorn and a little spike of veiny blue cheese.
T/M - Super tartness assaults the palate up front but levels with an irony, long and dry finish; mineral oil, seltzer water; texture is reminiscent of an unblended lambic, a little thinness mixed with a champagne feel. As it warms we get more of the stone fruit bitterness like grape skin or even lemon skin, more vinous, red wine vinegar.
D - This is an excellent, teeth chattering sour beer but something I can drink a lot of, like drinking a dry, expensive champagne without the bubbles. 833 charactersbiga7346, Jul 30, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -5.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Damn good beer...that being said, I think so much of the ravenously devout following that RR has is based so much around the hype of the company, and thus societally imposed interpretations of the beer manifest. But, that being said, this is a great fucking work of craft.
The beer looks like Pinot Noir: slightly translucent ruddy brown color, good haziness, nice carbonation visible in the frothiness of the head.
Smells of beautiful vinous cherry, subtle oak, and tangy yeast.
Taste follows smell, almost to the letter. A bit more tang from the wild. very subtle and refreshing, not terribly funky.
Yes, there's a reason, objectively, that there is so much hype surrounding RR. But, you can pay 2 dollars more for a 750mL of Jolly Pumpkin and support a smaller, still-growing independent producer that makes a beer that's almost as good in a very similar style. 868 charactersStaEva, Jul 26, 2011

Big thanks to jzeilinger for this one.
Poured from a 375ml. bottle.
Appearance: A lightly tan head generously fills the glass above a deep amber body. Stick lacing and retention is great though it would have been nice if it lasted longer.
Smell: Sour cherries, vinegar, dry with a mostly tart aroma though a hint of sweet there.
Taste: Very tart bordering on sour. Not mouth puckering but close. Next to no vinegar except a slight hint in the finish. Sourish cherries throughout with some wood on the outskirts.
Mouthfeel: Active carbonation with a lively body makes this one pleasant. Yes it abrasively sour sometimes but i also find it refreshing strangely enough.
Overall: I must honestly say it took me awhile to grow accustomed to it and it was a bit difficult but worth the effort. A truly well made beer. 836 characterspapat444, Jul 26, 2011

S- Lactic acid and sour cherries. There is some bready yeast character coming through towards the end, but very slight. Smells very sour.
T- Tastes very sour up front with some intense pucker on the palate. You get some of the bready yeast character, but its mostly acidic cherry. Very well balanced and amazingly clean.

Pours a nice light brown with a small tan head. Aromas of tart cherries, oak, and funkiness. Taste was nothing short of amazing..tart, dry and refreshing. Medium body with just the right amount of carbonation to make the sourness pop. A fantastic example of how a sour beer should be done. If I had access to this all the time I could see it being a regular offering in my fridge. 430 charactersxerotime, Jul 24, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this one for $17 at Eulogy while traveling in Philadelphia. A steep price, but building in the restaurant's markup, I felt pretty much fine about this pricier pickup, especially since this beer never comes my way. Having had some of their traditional ales (Salvation, Redemption, Damnation), this sour from Russian River really knocked me out. 
A lot of people talk about Russian River's sours as if they're of an entirely different stock than their other beers. I can now see why. The balance on this wild ale rivals anything from the best Belgian sours, and has a subtlety that quickly trumps other American brewers like, say, Allagash (not that that subtlety is always a good thing). 
Ruby colored with fruity notes that are both vibrant and delicately mixed. There's no unpleasant sharpness challenging or harming the taste. Likewise, the carbonation is just active enough to bring out the subtler notes that might otherwise be lost. Smooth and downright delicious, I can't wait to find this one on tap. Curious how it would compare to that fresh Lou Pepe 2008 I just had... 1,084 characterspetacutlasaurus, Jul 22, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks for the super efficient hand-off OrangeAmps. 375 mL bottle poured into a stemless wine glass.
Ruby red with auburn highlights, this almost looks orange when held up to the light. Translucent. A creamy one-finger head forms and never fades. Just a little swirl leaves cascading lacing all over my glass. Beautiful.
Lots of tart, sour cherries in the nose, with an underlying aroma of citrus fruits. Barnyard funk and lemons abound. All that wild sourness is balanced by fruit sweetness - this almost reminds me of (honest-to-goodness, not out of a plastic lemon) lemon juice. Very, very appealing.
Well, it's sour. Those sour cherries in the aroma are the first to hit, and God do they stick around. There's an immediate sourness in the back of my throat; again, lemon juice. This is all lactic funk and horse blanket enveloping a wine-like cherry flavor profile. Not even close to mouth-puckering, this is supremely well-balanced.
The mouthfeel is perfect. Absolutely flawless carbonation, but somehow it feels creamy. Simultaneously lively and smooth, this is terribly easy to put down. 
I first tried Supplication this February, when I split a 375 with a good friend. Tonight, I was more than eager to polish off a little bottle on my own. I will crush a 750 before the summer is over. 1,300 charactersamphion1065, Jul 20, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle, batch 2.
Pours a hazy reddish golden brown color with a medium sized off white head. 
The aroma is tart cherries, woody, acidic and moderately sour. The Brett fingerprints are there as well.
The flavor is heavy with tart cherries, caramel malts, woody, and an overall sourness that is very drinkable. This is extremely well crafted.
Medium bodied with the perfect level of tart fruit to provide a tingle yet still come off smooth. 
I had this batch when it was fresh and it has aged wonderfully. I have had a bottle of the batch 2 every year since it was released and it never fails to satisfy. Great stuff. 626 charactersajsdad06, Jul 20, 2011

Pours a pleasant caramel hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a one inch, dense and creamy off-white head embedded with tiny ringlets. Textured bands of lacing are revealed as the brew recedes. Nose expresses tart cherries, a buttery quality and a trace of American Oak. Cherry is much more muted in the flavor profile. There is also a vinegary and citrus character dispersed throughout. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a bright, lively carbonation, some acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands and a semi-dry finish. This is a solid American Wild - not my favorite from this brewer, but quite complex and refreshing. 706 charactersJwale73, Jul 17, 2011

The Tour de France is on, riders are climbing the Col du Tourmalet in the Pyrenees - seems like a perfect time to crack this one. Even if it is a replay of an earlier live broadcast.
Deep amber color with minimal head - but vigorous carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass.
Aroma of cherries, bitter oak, slight funk, and a bright sour sweetness.
Taste is tart, dry, and vinous. Carbonation gives it a pleasant, velvet mouthfeel that amplifies the flavor and complexity. Fine bubbles coat the side of the glass.
This is definitely one to be sipped and savored, contemplated. Another home run from Russian River. 673 charactersdraheim, Jul 15, 2011
4.14/5  rDev -8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Batch 005x4, poured into a snifter.
Murky brown in color, dark orange/red/rust when held to the light.  Aggressive pour yields a finger thick off white head with settles to a film.
The nose is strong, I can smell it while it sits at the table.  Right up front is a winey character, and strong notes of oak aging.  Sour dark cherries, Brett, and maybe some other dark fruits.
The taste is immediately sour cherries and a nice oak background.  The sour tartness hangs on to the end.  The finish is sour and very funky.
Mouthfeel is effervescent and full bodied.  Missing the light refreshing feel I like in my sours.
Overall, another nice sour offering from Russian River.  Although this one is pretty straight forward sour cherries on oak, it's nice. 761 charactersAdrianized, Jul 14, 2011

4.27/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy brown with some slight burgandy tints and nice foamy throughout the session. A lot of floaties but good. Nice funk in the aroma with some cherries, raspberries and wine-like whiffs. Nice. Tough on the esophogus after each sip for me....right to the finish. Tart but not overly distracting. Some cherries and more tart fruit in the taste. Nice. Dry and clean finish. Salivation on the buds after each sip. Overall I thought this was a great wild ale and a great starter if someone is looking to try the style. Not overly sour and pleasant to sip. 558 characterskaseydad, Jul 13, 2011
3.93/5  rDev -12.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A: Deep Crimson, a lot of fizz, little retention.
S: Wild cherries, fermented wheat, a hint of hops.
T: Sour with a really light hint of cherry in the background. I guess this type of beer just isn't my style.
M: Light, Tangy, Bubbly, with a deep layer of sourness hanging overall.
O: With the mythical proportions that Russian River has ascended to, I guess I set the bar too high and ended up disappointed. All of this gibberish about this brew proving beer had no limits and is an American national treasure overhyped this to an absurd level. Sure it was a good beer, but it is not the second coming of Christ in beer form like a lot of people on BA seem to believe. It also doesn't help that this beer cost $12 (american). I will say try it if you're feeling indulgent, but don't invest in the hype. 807 charactersKubus, Jul 11, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- This offer pours with a bit of carbonation, eventually settles to a thin halo of head around the edges of the glass. Glowing sunburst hue, with blood orange color in the center that radiates outwards into a golden straw yellow. Lots of great bubbling, looks almost like a sparkling wine or cider.
S- Though the strong suggestion of vinegar in the nose may be unpleasing to some palates, it immediately makes my mouth water. Some tart cherry comes through, but mostly a sticky sweet acidity. No hops are detected whatsoever, and the smell of the malt has been so strongly mutated by the sour yeasts that it's unrecognizable.
T- At first sip, a bit of light oaked fruit sits on the tongue for a moment, and then a wave of sour makes its way across the palate. The vinegar notes are expertly married with balanced sweet cherry, and the brown ale base keeps the whole concoction still within beer territory. That being said, the barrel aging and semblance of tannin structure put forth a lot of wine personality in this brew, which is, in my opinion, one of the most attractive things about wild ales. You get much of the character and diversity of fine wines without the high alcohol content (or price tag). The aftertaste sees the bacterial acidity through a slow transformation into a pleasantly mild lemon juice finish. It's fantastic for the style, but personally, I would have liked just a tad more sweetness in the flavor profile. Be it from more malt or treating the cherries differently, this brew might have been driven into my 'all-time-favorites' with a little something more to provide contrast to the sourness.
M- I think the rather high carbonation really works well for this type of beer, contributing to the overall refreshing nature of the style. The light citric flavors, tartness, and sparkling mouthfeel once again almost take this into champagne/sparkling white wine territory, but of course no grape has the gumption to make this ambitiously bold of a beverage.
O- Russian River has cemented it's reputation as one of the best (if not the best) producer of American wild ales, period. I tried not to judge this brew against my preferred vehicle of sour beers (Flanders Reds) and consider it within the parameters of its style. Personal preference aside, this was a masterfully brewed beer that is positively bursting with originality and flavor. 2,371 charactersgigaknight, Jul 10, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 006x2 When this arrived I had to force myself to wait and let it settle from its airplane ride. The anticipation was almost to much to bear. Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale glass holds the whole bottle.
Appearance - This one is for me and me alone. The color of the liquid is deep amber almost the color of a cherry wood stain. 
Smell - The smell is funky, with a hint of woody undertones. You can smell the cherries. They are in the background, but they are there. The smell is adding to the anticipation. 
Taste - First you are hit with the sour taste. It hits immediately, however it dissipates quickly. That funky taste one comes to expect flashes in the palate competing with the sour. Oh how I love this competition. There is no vinegar after taste that I have come accustom to when trying beers of this style. The cherry is late to the party and highly welcomed. Five minutes in and I am still tasting cherries! While I smelled wood, I can not taste it. The pinot noir is lost in my opinion, however maybe I would long for it if the beer were aged in something different.
Mouthfeel - This is sour but not a pucker your lips I do not want it again sour. The carbonation helps with this I think. The beer is definitely alive with carbonation. The beer plays across my tongue. I belched on the third sip! That makes it a real beer in my opinion! I think maybe another California brewery might want to take a field trip and get some pointers. I love the mouthfeel!
Overall - Oh where have you been all my life. Now, I have a ways to go in terms of Wilds, Lambics, and Guezes. I have had several in my time. I still need to try all sorts of beers yet to qualify as some sort of sour expert. However, with that written, I must state this plainly as I can. This is the best Wild Ale I have ever had and one of the top 5 beers I have ever had. 1,849 charactersTheMurse, Jul 10, 2011

4.25/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I felt this beer was going to be a challenge for me to get down. Since I'm not a big fan of sour ales if this wasn't a Russian River brew I probably would have just overlooked it. The beer poured out as a sparkling red color with some in there too. The head was fizzy and white and then vanished pretty quickly. The smell of this beer was big, it's stung the nostrils like sex panther a little bit. The smell of tart cherries and oak wood mixed with a big amount of wild yeast explode on nose. The taste of the beer is interesting too, The sour cherries almost make your lips pucker, the sour subsides and leaves you with a nice oak and vanilla smoothness. The mouthfeel is little thin, but has enough flavor to balance out the whole thing. Overall it's a good sour beer, I'm trying to give it praise despite the fact I don't care for the style. I feel that people who enjoy these will definitely enjoy this one too. 916 charactersKnapp85, Jul 05, 2011

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - pours a reddish copper color with a nice white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Loud audible fizz, like champagne.
S - great smell of cherries, pinot noir type notes (like jammy fruits), other stone fruits, and a good amount of funk to balance it. Not unlike some krieks.
T - Significantly sour but not unpleasantly, with plenty of fruit flavors dancing around. Sour cherries predominate and there are some apple and pear notes as well. The funkiness is a bit subdued in place of sourness.
M - high prickly carbonation, like a sparkling wine. Finish is a split between dry and silky.
Overall - a superb sour. I can pick out the cherries and the pinot noir barrel aging fairly easily. It's not as funky as some others, which is fine because the flavors are very well balanced. Definitely seek out RR beers if you can. 828 charactersHotHands, Jul 02, 2011

4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours bright brown with a medium sized head. Nice lacing on the surface. Visible carbonation. Smell is yeasty. Big cherries. Taste has a big hit of tartness up front. Balanced with just a touch of background sweetness. Sour cherries are very noticeable but don't totally dominate the flavor. Puckering tartness ends with a dry hit of bitterness. Tons of flavors all over the place. Oak. A bit of herbal hops. Lots of barnyard yeastiness. The wild strains are obvious, although it's hard for me to describe the flavors they contribute (except for some sourness) since I've had very few wild beers. Great well carbonated mouthfeel. Full to medium bodied. Crisp with a lip smacking tart and dryish finish. Great tart and slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this is pretty great stuff. I paid a lot for it but I'm definitely glad I tried it and will check out the rest of their wild ales if I can find them. 903 charactersburnstar, Jun 28, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 04X3
Opens with a huge pop of the cork and then some foam works it's way out. The pour reveals a nearly clear, light mahogany with a 1-finger, off-white head that hangs around for a short while before devolving into a cover leaving a short ring of wet lace. 
The smell is a pleasant aroma of sour cherry and yeasty goodness. The wine from the barrels also makes it's presence known.
The taste is tart (but not quite puckering) cherries, the oak from the barrels stands out as well. The Brett adds funk to the many things happening with this delicious beer.
Mouthfeel is medium tending to full and quite dry with lingering moderate carbonation.
Overall: This is a very well-made beer that I'd like to have more of if the price was right. Most of the elements in this beer tend to balance themselves out so that nothing is particularly overwhelming except that the sourness is always there. It does deserve to be priced higher than many other beers - considering the effort put into it. Any sour lover could hardly do better than this one. It's worth the effort to obtain one and I look forward to it's next arrival in Philly. 1,135 charactersmeatyard, Jun 25, 2011

S - Some nice sour funk and cherry tartness. As it warms up the cherry comes out more.
T - Quite good -- lots of tart, sour cherry, sour funkiness, and more sour. Not quite mouth-puckering, but quite sour. Some hints of oak, and a base of simple, sweet malt underneath it all. Reminiscent of a kriek, but the cherry isn't quite so prominent and there's a bit of oak. Really tasty.
M - Medium mouthfeel, rather smooth, but with quite a bit of carbonation. A touch of acidity on the back of my tongue. It fits the beer wonderfully.
Overall, tasty tasty. I love Russian River wilds. 677 charactersabraxel, Jun 25, 2011

T I had this stored at about 55 degrees so it was cool enough to drink and enjoy from the beginning. It got a little sweeter as it warmed up too. The beer has a lot of depth of flavor. At first the beer is really tight, but gets more open as time goes on.
m-Sour candy with a kick. Has a lot of good feel, lingers on for a while.

Before I go on, this is my first sour ale, so take my review with a grain of salt if you will.
Pours a violently fizzy deep clear grape red amber hue. Very pretty little thing. Head is violent fizzy storm but is gone within a matter of seconds.
In the nose I get all sour grapes! Woody base to it, but sour grapes really steal the nose.
Have not tasted anything like this before, at least from a beer. The best thing I can relate this to is those tear jerker sour grape round bubblegums I used to eat as a kid. This is really good, very fruity, sour & drinkable. Sweet & sour, jaw clenching at times but makes your mouth water for more. Aftertaste is straight pinot noir, but right before this hits the punch of sour that radiates through your jaw. 
Note: I know it says cherries added, but grape is the fruit that really steals my nose & my palate.
This is a lighter bodied fizzier brew, although the head is nowhere to be found after the initial pour. Carbonation is ideal for the style.
Picked this up for $13 online + shipping. 
Even though its a solid brew & I loved it, it is not readily available for me & costs a pretty penny. Will be trying other RR sours, but just a taste of this is good for me. Pliny the Elder on the other hand, well that is my first brewdiction!
Overall, really nice for my first sour. 1,471 charactershoptualBrew, Jun 23, 2011

A- A nice burst from the cork pop, no foaming. Suppy's base beer is a brown ale but the look is more of a deep red with bright orange, faint bubbles rising. Cant see through the liquid. Some bubbles form islands of foam on the surface, nothing major, no lace either. This beer looks delicious.
S- This is one great smelling beer, very inviting. The sour cherries are very noticable, telling me they have not faded completely. Funk and some wild yeast strains giving off those strange scents I've come to love. The oak in this is quite possibly my favorite aspect of the nose.
T- At first Im hit with funk and sour cherries. I like supplication fresh as the cherries is what drew me to this in the 1st place. This bottle has some slight age on it. The cherries give off some tart while the 4 wild yeast strains do as well, brett and lacto being heavyhitters. Lemon and other fruits come in under the cherries The oak gives off wood while some wine characteristics step the taste up a few notches, this is tasty as F___. Not really getting any of the brown ale tastes but there is some malt towards the end. 
M- This one is quite sour and tart. The puckering capabilities are up there, I can handle it though, this one is a sinch to drink. The body is somewherenear medium with perfect carbonation. I never have to worry about carb on a RR product, they are always dead on. Sup has a crispness to it and is just a lively all around beer.
D- Cant wait for these to come in 750ml bottles, 375 just does not seem like enough, but I do love the small bottles as well. With that said I could and would drink this all night until my stomach could not handle it anymore. It's great cold and just opens up with time. This would go great with some fine cheese, the perfect match. This is one of my favorite beers ever.
Batch 4(About two years old) into my Russian River Tulip.
This beer continues to impress me and it is my favorite. Some time in the bottle really does magic to this. Another pop from the cork, suppy is a brownish red with some orange up towards the light. A cream colored shell of foam stays on top throughout with nice sheets that stick. Smell is straight out lacto with sour cherry at this point. Pungent with leather and I guess you can say malt from the base. A bretty sting with some warming. The cherry has not left, it only got more aggressive. Taste is just oh my god, I love this beer. Cherry flavor with sourness that knocks socks off. I gotta say, Sup does wonders in the bottle if you have a good batch of it and give it some time in a OK enviornment. Sometimes, warm is your friend. Lacto soaked cherry with pedio/sach/brett in that order, no fooling. Supp Vs Sanct, you can tell the difference, especially in the newer Sanct versions with all brett, lacto shines here. Im babbling. All I can say is lay these suckers down if you got em, they will sour till your hearts delight, much more than the batch 4 Temptation which I think is dwindling. I love it. 3,153 charactersBARFLYB, Jun 23, 2011

Hazy soft rose color with a whitish head. This beer gave much sour cherry and an oaky woodiness in the nose with lesser amounts of green apple and horse blanket. Quite intriguing and inviting. Less cherry in the flavor, but this gave way to other fruits... maybe a touch of apricot, more apple, and a light berry tartness. Bubbly carbonation lifted the light body. A fine beer indeed. Paired nicely with blue types of cheese. 530 charactersDmanGTR, Jun 23, 2011

Brew was shared with Klym, the consumer of all liquids. 
Reviewed from notes, an artifact of a legendary weekend session.
A: Reddish pumpkin with a deep maple syrup presence. Very cola looking with a strong two finger hyper-sizzlin head. Tufts of sea-foam whiteness peak into mountains where the sides recede to form clouds around the foamy summit. Beautiful beer!
S: Big tart yeast with cherry and craisins. Pickle juice consumes the berries and then blends them to form a very sweet red wine vinegar. This whiff makes me salivate uncontrollably. Let's drink already!
T: Lime juice that crashes into pickle juice, a late middle of yellow squash. Strong cranberry/cherry tartness that subsides into a bright red wine vinegar. Incredibly consistent phases of -- nay, a royal procession of flavor. Top tier.
M: A great everlasting sizzle of a mouth. It has a real punch to follow the super clean flavor and mouth. The different elements come together in an air tight collaboration. I salivate from the smell, the taste, and in the memory. I held back tears when my glass emptied too soon. A fantastic wild ale; with a high end cocktail party mouth to boot.
O: There's a lot to say about this beer, but really it's just so well made. The wood does this brew a real honor by taking would could be seen as too bretty/tart/sweet, and making it a refined offering. All the flavors are in check, but they aren't exactly conservative either. I'd love to hear what a master's palate would say of this one, because I think there's far more in there than a laymen can give credit for. I'd come back to this one after more "education". 1,679 charactersCavery, Jun 22, 2011

The taste was very tart (not overly sour) initially. I was pleasantly surprised by the sweetness. Cherries were the predominant flavor, with a subtle oakiness. The finish was dry and refreshing, with medium carbonation. Overall this was a really tasty and satisfying beer. 463 characterssurlytheduff, Jun 20, 2011

3.5 A: Nearly clear red zinfandel color. Came without a head, so no comment there.
4.5 S: Big hit of tart cherry, then plum, grape, tangy lactic acid with a mild sourness. Lots of vanilla with oak on its heels and tannic astringency at a minimum.
4.0 T: The potent cherry in the nose is much less powerful in the taste, but it is still the main attraction. A host of other flavors are introduced though. Wild apple, a touch of acetic acid, a touch of musky funkiness, and this time more sour than tart. Vanilla is much subdued, but the oak itself is stronger.
3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Could be a lot creamier, but balanced enough to be quite smooth. 
4.0 D: Good, solid all around beer. 773 charactersDavoleBomb, Jun 19, 2011

I have been looking forward to drinking this beer for a while now and I have to be honest the beer actually intimidated me at first. I usually don't drink sour beers and I was afraid that because of the style I was going to be really disappointed in the beer.
I got my hands on a few entry level / basic sours to get a feel for them and I liked what I was trying. So last night on my first night of vacation I broke down and opened up the bottle. I poured the 12oz bottle into a snifter glass to find a deep red, amber, hazy body with a bubbly head that dissipated quickly.
The aroma of course was dominated with the sour cherries and oak. I also noticed some dried fruits at the end which gave it more of a sweeter aroma than I expected.
The taste was exceptional, and I was really impressed. There are a lot of different things going on here that just work so well together. The tart cherries, oak, sweetness, and funk. The beer is sour, but its so enjoyable with the sweetness thats balanced in. The carbonation and alochol are just right. 
I could go on and on about this beer, it really was a great experience to drink it and I really wish I could get this on a weekly basis. I can say that I am a fan of sours now and look forward to trying more but at the same time the bar is set very high! 1,315 charactersDan3279, Jun 19, 2011

Supplication pours a rose color with a bit of head retention and a small amount of lacing. The aroma is slightly sour with a nice fruity cherry note, as it warms, a very distinct wine and funky side emerges. The taste has the cherries and a mild mild oak wine presence which is a nice counterpoint to the cherries and tartness, with the same character emerging as the beer warms. This beer is extremely light and refreshing and complex. Very enjoyable beer, especially for the summer. Very light and very well carbonated with a nice bite. Have not quite gotten into sours, but this is a very good beer to get going with. 633 charactersAgold, Jun 17, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5375ml bottle into Duvel tulip. Batch 005X3, so bottled 5/3/10. Thanks to BA msulinski for trading me this bottle!
Appearance: Moderate pour yields a one inch fizzy white head that dissipates slowly. Pours a semi-translucent dark red and leaves large, many-pointed swatches of lacing that don't go away. 
Smell: In the bottle: sour cherries and acetic sourness. In the glass: oak, some mild Brett, and even milder sour cherry in the background. Lactic sourness comes out quickly. The smell develops heavily minutes after leaving the bottle, and gets nice and deep with warmth. Almost floral. Good, but a bit faint.
Taste: First sip is sour cherry up front with a big, complex and tangy Brett note, a nice hit of sourness and then a soft but full oak note and more Brett. Sour cherry and tartness come back for the long aftertaste. Second sip brings out some surprisingly distinct and prominent Pinot Noir flavor, then more sour cherry and tons of Brett.
It's been awhile since I've had a wild ale this Bretty... I love it. That said, everything here is in balance. There's multiple types of sourness, a decent brown ale occasionally detectable underneath all the barrel treatment, and lots of strong and interesting flavors constantly emerging. 
The sour cherry notes are substantial but mild; this isn't sour cherry forward like Red Poppy (which, deliciously, tastes like drinking sour cherries). The fruit notes are integrated like everything else. Even the dominant Brett manifests as distinct, complimentary notes; tangy up front, deep and musty in back. Despite the 7% ABV, there is not a hint of solvent or booziness anywhere in the vast array of flavors in this beer.
Each sip yields exciting and bold flavors up front and in the middle, then a beautiful, oaky mellowing into the tart and Bretty finish and aftertaste. World class stuff.
Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied. Perfect carbonation; abundant but just enough to keep the feel soft and creamy. Despite the numerous types of sourness, the feel is never stinging or abrasive. There's a great clarity to the flavor, bolstered by the excellent mouthfeel.
Overall: This beer is a real treat. It's one of those endlessly complex and delicious beers where even when you write too much in your review, you still haven't properly described all the beautiful things going on in the flavor. When you get the chance to drink this beer, take it. 2,410 charactersPahn, Jun 17, 2011
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5this is described by RR as "Brown Ale aged in French oak Pinot Noir barrels with three strains of Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and sour cherries." it was also my first real sour (i.e. not the duchesse or monk's flemish.) i decided this was the place and beer to try it with. i wasn't disappointed. it was really, really good. it's hard for me to evaluate it because of my lack of sour expertise, but i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to trying other RR sour offerings that i brought back with me from seattle. 529 charactersFranch, Jun 16, 2011

A: Reddish amber with 3/8" soapy white head that dissipated over 2 minutes.
S: Sour cherries and yeast.
T: Starts off like a typical cherry lambic, but is incredibly smooth and dry and leaves very little aftertaste. Very peculiar and interesting, you want to just keep going for more and more in order to try and figure it out...
M: High level of medium carbonation. Wow.
O: I typically don't like sour beers or lambics but I really enjoy this beer. Exceptional. 494 charactersDaftCaskBC, Jun 16, 2011

This bottle has been in my fridge for almost a year now, and i figured that today is as good a day as any. I've had it plenty of times, but i have yet to review it.
A - Beer pours a bright, clear, reddish amber with a tight, bubbly one finger head that quickly recedes leaving some lacing. The head clings to the sides of the glass. Some yeast sediment is floating in the glass, but its not distracting in the least. almost non-existent layer of white head.
S - Aroma is tart and funky. Sour cherries, brett-y funk and some oakiness from the pinot barrels really shine through.
T - Tart and funky, duh! But not so fast. This is an insanely complex beer. Sour cherries provide a mouth puckering sourness, immediately followed by some hay like funk and some subtle oak notes. Very similar dry finish to a nice Pinot Noir wine.
M - Light bodied with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry and mouth puckering.
O - Always a favorite of mine when it comes to sours. Very complex and refreshing. Im so lucky to have this beer available at all times. 1,111 charactersdubinsky, Jun 14, 2011

Brown Ale aged in French oak Pinot Noir barrels with three strains of Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and sour cherries. 375 ml cork and caged bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks Anand!
Appearance: Rust brown, somewhat hazy, with a very good and creamy light khaki colored head. Excellent retention and lacing. 5/5
Aroma: Sour, obviously. Notes of brett, but not overpowering. Much sweeter than I expected, and very welcome. Earth, spice, and fruit --- quite rustic. Some vinegary sharpness comes along with warmth. 4/5
Taste: Tart and sweet, but never overpoweringly sour. Everything from the aroma is present, and it goes down with a kiss of sour cherries. Amazingly clean with a subtle yet long aftertaste of cherries and funk. Also, oak gets quite strong as the beer warms up. 4/5
Mouthfeel: The body is medium with a certain fullness yielded by the high, and yet soft, carbonation. It's an oxymoron! Very dry and clean. 4.5/5
Overall, very very good, and so refreshing! A testimony to what subtle can be... it is sour but a lot of other things too. I love it. 4.5/5 1,110 characterstewaris, Jun 13, 2011

Had at Monk's Cafe, my first ever Russian River sour, I trembled with excitement as my waitress brought it to my table.
A- It pours a dark cherry red, almost ruby, with an active head that sticks around the whole time, though never exceeds more than half an inch. Lacing sticks to the cup all the way.
S- Some barnyard funkiness, but not as much as I would have guessed. Still, the brett is there enough to let me know this is a great sour before I even taste it. Lemon juice, vinegar, sour cherries, oak, and candy all are present.
T- oh man! awesome sour taste here, mouth-puckering but really not overpowering. The barrel-aging is worth it, because earthy, oaky char comes through to balance the acidic sourness. I don't drink much wine, but I detect some wine like characters too. Probably the most complex sour I've had, since sourness is only one feature of the multifacted flavor. Mouthfeel is good too, very carbonated.
O- I have read and read and read about Russian River this, Russian River that. Well, there is a reason people are talking, this might be the best beer I have ever had. 1,113 charactersTschnab, Jun 13, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a slight hazy reddish brown into the glass with bright Red highlights. Aromas of tart cherry and dark fruit and oak. Flavor is a burst of intense but smooth sourness delivered nicely with the carbonation with a bit of fruitiness and faint oak. Very soft malt flavors stay on the tongue as it dries out on the finish. Not my "Style" of beer, but starting to intrigue me more and more. Just like 2IPA's did a couple of yrs. ago, now they are 1 of my favorite styles. Maybe sours will be next? 496 charactersbeergod1, Jun 13, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Ah, Supplication. Your 375ml bottle has been sitting in my fridge for quite some time now. No longer will you take up room while my tongue cries for you. A 7% sour barrel-aged 12-15 month brew will finally be imbibed. Batch 005x3 poured into a snifter.
Pours the color of an amber-ruby red, like the mosquito lodged in tree sap in Jurassic Park. ROAR! Bathtub foam bubbles create a 1/2 inch of head, which quickly rescinds. A thin layer sticks around on top for the duration of your drinking session.
Aroma is all sour, brett-y funk, followed by cherries and other yeasty smells I'm not accustomed to coming in contact with. Really punches the olfactory glands. Smells like oak as well.
This extremely sour brown puckers your lips up & assaults your palette with a champagne effervescence and tart cherry combo. A fresh crispness coats the mouth in the finish, which actually becomes bitter after the swallow. This beverage is heavily carbonated, but that's not necessarily a bad thing here. A fizzy sour cherry bomb.
Not my style but highly enjoyable to say the least. Would seek this out again, and continue aging a few to see the effects. Californians - you are lucky. Very, very lucky. 1,193 charactersWisconsuds, Jun 12, 2011

My first RR sour!
A: Pours with a generous 2 finger head. Reddish-pink hue.
S: Cherry candy and funk…although not as funky smelling as I anticipated. The bubbly vapor goes through your nose and hits the back of your throat.
T: The funk is first and foremost. The other flavors are more muted than I expected but the funk makes it extremely sour and tangy. After the initial attack, cherry and mild oak notes follow, but the cherry is not nearly as intense as the scent indicated. I had to aerate this in my mouth quite a bit to bring out the characteristics from the pinot. Alcohol never really present. Finishes very dry.
M: On the thinner side. The brett plays with and enhances the carbonation. I love carbonation and this has it in spades so that’s a big attraction. Astringency detracts from the drinkability somewhat, but not unpleasantly so. Even though the alcohol is low, this isn’t to be consumed in large quantities.
O: Such a cool beer, but to be honest I’m not sure my palette is mature enough to fully appreciate it…but I know what I like! Can’t wait to try more of these varieties. 1,156 charactersmjtiernan, Jun 12, 2011

Shockingly gorgeous burnt amber color. Very surprised as I poured. Red hues almost glowing. very frothy and active white head. Not thick or creamy looking however. More of a bubbly randomness about a half millimeter thick floating atop.
Aroma is funk as expected. barnyard, hay, grass, dark fruit comes through very slightly. some fusal alcohol. Cleaner than expected. thought there would be some more fruit in the aroma. 
Taste starts slightly sweet but quickly sours. mouth watering puckerness. Sour cherries, white grapes, lemon rind. Salt. Oak and some very mild nuttiness. You can almost taste a charred wooden barrel if you look for it. 
Dry finish keeps calling you back. Savory sourness also contributes to the drinkability. Just an awesome complex flavor to this beer. Excellent.
Probably my favorite beer from russian river. And up there in the top 5 beers of all time for me.
This beer is definately worth the 18 bucks I paid for a small 375 ml bottle. 980 characterspalma, Jun 11, 2011

Review adapted from notes taken 12/20/10
Appearance: Hazy amber/copper color with a really nice head - fades to some nice lacing
Smell: Complex - funky, sour, tart, with a hint of cherry - some pale malts in the background - the overall smell is great, and it gets better as it warms
Taste: A thing of beauty - an intense amount of flavor, with so much going on - sour, with different kinds of sour - hints of fruit, hints of somewhat clean barnyard funk, hints of red wine, hints of wood - very tart and sour, but the toasted malts actually add a remarkable level of balance - beyond excellent
Mouthfeel: Medium body, sticks to my lips with funky, sour, delicious tartness - magnificent
Overall: Perhaps the best "ation" from Russian River
This beer is truly excellent, and I think I enjoyed it slightly more than Consecration and Temptation. It was that good. I remember getting this at a BA fest (before I even was interested in sours) and I liked it even then. Someday, I will acquire more bottles!
Update: 6/23/12
Another half a bottle courtesy of Goblinmunkey7. Score unchanged. This is legendary. I want to write love letters to this beer. 1,203 charactersangrybabboon, Jun 07, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5While I don't like having to struggle with the cork, it is a minor inconvenience when it comes to drinking this nectar. Pour resulted in a two finger head of foam with just a little sediment. I guess I should have poured it a bit slower. Nice lace that clings well from beginning to end. Color is a slightly hazy 9 on the SRM beer color chart. I think I am the fault of most of the haze. Smell is a rich complex palate of wonderful aromas. Sweet tree fruit smells, pear, apple, and cherry. Tart smells of mint leaf, and anise. Taste is a grand mixture of pleasing flavors of cherry, caramel, grapefruit, sour red grapes, anise, malt, and a hint of wood. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, much like butter melting in your mouth with zing added for effect. I would like another, but my wallet would scream and so would my head from the rush of alcohol. 846 charactersbeerprovedwright, Jun 07, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours with one finger of light tan head that rests on top of a perfectly clear, amber-brown body with delicate streams of carbonation rising to the surface. The foam settles down to thin layer after a minute or so and leaves moderately thick rings of lace on the walls of the glass.
S - An acidic aroma that is reminiscent of a Flemish red beer. Notes of dry caramel malt and black cherries blend with balsamic vinegar and earthy licorice.
T - Tart pie cherries up front with some lightly sweet caramel. More sour cherry notes in the middle with a deep, earthy funk note beginning to come out. Things finish up with more tart fruit and caramel along with notes of plum, white wine, green olives, and earthy hop flavors but only light bitterness. Lingering wild yeast character along with stone fruit and oak in the aftertaste.
M - Medium body, moderately high carbonation, and a very dry finish.
D - An excellent beer that really show off the potential for non traditional sour beer matured in barrels. Nothing is wasted or excessive here; the cherry contributes a great deal of complexity while the wine barrel aging is a background note that briefly pops out as a distinctive, vinous character in the finish. The sourness and bone dry finish both work to enhance the drinkability of an already very quaffable beer. 1,324 charactersnickfl, Jun 07, 2011

Batch 5
Color: A hazy copper color with hints of brown at the core of this beer. A nice nickle sized head forms of the off white color. A good amount of lacing is left behind in the glass.
Nose: Complex and intense! Tart cherries hit first followed by hints off oak and wild yeast funk.
Rounding off the aroma of this beer are apples and a slight vinegar smell.
Palate: An amazing mouth feel. Sour/tart with a great level of carbonation. The cherries coat the tongue and are then washed away by earthy tones and barnyard flavors. 
Finish: Wow! Dry and complex. An immaculate beer that offers plenty of texture and surprises. One of the better beers in the world. 701 charactersschmoopsbeer, Jun 06, 2011

375mL corked and caged bottle into a Cigar City snifter.
Batch 006x1
A- Pours a deep ruby red color with about a 1 finger cream colored head that stays for a ridiculous amount of time after the initial pour, never going below about half a finger. Fantastic lacing on this one as well.
S- Strong cherries with a nicely integrated sour funkiness to it that I really enjoy. Wild yeast is definitely present as well, with a nice funky wet hay/barnyard scent, with slight oaky undertones. Very appealing.
T- Great sour and tart cherries up front with that funky wild yeast I come to expect present in spades. The sourness becomes more subtle as it warms, giving way to a little of the oak from the barrels. It's very subtle, but it's there and I love it.
M- Semi-smooth, light, and soft, with decent carbonation. Provides a nice and dry finish that lingers for a while after the last sip.
O- This is my second of the Russian River sours, and this one was more enjoyable than Consecration to me overall. Love the use of the cherries and the nice oak presence as well. A fantastic example of a wild and a great introduction to wilds as well. Very well done. 1,238 charactersJoshVandy, Jun 04, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- Brown with a deep reddish hue. Poured with about a two inch head, settles nicely into about a quarter inch head that is quite fluffy. Great head retention. Also quite a bit of lacing on the glass. Quite carbonated when it is poured. Even after a few minutes, can see bubbles traveling up the glass. 
Right off the bat, can tell this is a special beer.
S- Smells of cherries with other fruity smells in there. I honestly don't have the greatest sense of smell, however, first smells of cherries, with sharp citrus scents in there as well, with just a hint of an oaky aroma. 
T- Tastes mostly of cherries with just a hint of oak. Nice laid back funk to it. A little sour bite to it, however, does not make you pucker. Extremely balanced; almost difficult to discern flavors because everything blends so well....this is definitely a good thing
M- medium mouthfeel; not extremely thick, but not thin by any means. Beer almost sticks to the inside of the mouth and finishes medium dry. 
O- One of the best beers I've ever had. For some reason, I expected this to be more challenging to drink, however, compared to other sours this was not extremely sour or extremely funky. The real magic in this beer for me was how all of the flavors of fruit, funk, sour, and oak blended together.
For a sour, drinkability was off the charts. If I had brought back more from Colorado, I would definitely be drinking multiple bottles.
I brought back three of these from Colorado, and now I am really regretting not bringing back more... 1,526 charactersmattkooler, Jun 02, 2011

My favorite sour. Aroma is filled with cherries and apples. Taste is the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a sour. But it's not over the top sour. It's basically the most balanced sour I've ever tasted. This is only one of a few sours that I would completely feel comfortable (and excited) about drinking pint after pint.

This beer pours a rich, brownish amber in color, very reminiscent of cherry wood. It featured a nice cream colored head which laces the glass and sticks to the sides. The aromas consist of primarily sour cherry with a light grape like sweetness. It has a good amount of funk but it's hard to tell which is winning, the cherry or the funk. I'm glad the sweetness is allowed to show past the cherry. The flavors are very sour and dry. You definitely get a boatload of cherry, oak, and nice funk. The tartness is in your face initially before letting the other flavors take place. The most impressive aspect is how the flavor resonates even five minutes later. It leaves behind a really, really nice aftertaste of all of the flavors meshed together in perfect harmony. Overall this is a very, very good wild and I definitely prefer it over Consecration. 995 charactersaasher, Jun 01, 2011

a-deep mahogany reddish color. Cork pops with ease, lots of carbonation and lively bubbles meet the glass. Head never gives way, stays about a 1/4" thick. Does not lace much down the glass. Carbonation is not too much, goes well with the beer. 
s-cherries, sour, brett, funk, wine barrel, oak. Tons of nose in this beer. Opens up when it warms. The cherries are huge in the beginning, but as it warms, the brett and other bacteria come forward. 
t-I tasted this beer when it was cold, then let it sit and warm. Huge difference in how the flavors open up. A lot of sour cherries are supported by brett and wood. The beer has a lot of depth of flavor. At first the beer is really tight, but gets more open as time goes on.
m-right on the money. Has a lot of good feel, lingers on for a while.
o-I bought another one to cellar, and I am damn excited. This beer should do quite well with some time. This is a great example of a wild ale. 946 charactersgoosewhisperer, May 30, 2011

Tastes like sour cherry, little wood, little funk, great acidity. Finishes with a lingering tartness, not quite pucker sour but definitely leaves me wanting to take the next sip.

4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap; Sampled batches 4, 5, & 6 side by side
The beer sits a mahogany infused brownish body. Looks like a pale red wine. No head or lacing to speak of.
The aroma and flavor varied greatly between the three batches. 
Batch 4
The nose on this batch was overly tart, in comparison. Oak, cherries, white wine and Brett were all present in equal doses. There was a little sweetness from the cherries, but overall this is a sour delivery vehicle. Oak and white wine are very pronounced.
Batch 5
A little more subdued than 4. The oak wasn't nearly as omnipresent, while the cherries and wine took center stage. The Brett lends an earthy funk that complements the cherries nicely.
Batch 6
It was obvious this was the youngest of the bunch. The flavors and aromas were amazingly tame compared to the other vintages. Fresher and cleaner. Oak is just a layer here, while the cherries and wine shine. The cherries are both tart and sweet. Brett lays low.
Overall, the mouthfeel was somewhat similar, just varying in intensity. The 6 was clean and dry with a mild tartness while the 4 was lip-smacking tart and extremely dry. The 5 was perfectly in the middle of the two.
All three of these batches are fabulous. The 4 was definitely my favorite as it exhibited all of the characteristics you look for in a sour in spades. One of the best beers I have ever had. 1,356 charactersColForbinBC, May 28, 2011

Batch 006X1. Served at 55 Degrees into two wine bottles. Heavy duty 375ml. Feels heavier empty than it does full. Magic!
A: Pours deep straw, amber and brown. Off-white head literally lasts forever. One of the best looking beers I've ever seen. A spectacle in the glass.
S: Definitely the most barnyardy American brew I've ever had. Wet hay and mushroom are very much present. Fruit is apparent as well with grapes and cherries being a big ingredient. Also suggetions of plum and raisin. Slightly bready malt component. Very complex. The oak is fucking brilliant.
T: Lots of Oak, and barnyard funk. Lingering fruity finish. Prepare to taste this one for about 15 minutes after final swallow.
M: Extremely carbonated. Sipped on this for about 30 minutes or so and was super carbed until the final drop. however, these are fine champagne bubbles, and are soft on the palate. Sure does make you burp though... How uncouth for such a fine beer. Dry? yes... its Sahara desert dry. every cell in your mouth immediately puckers up on contact.
Overall: This is a Magnificent beer. Certainly up there with Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen. I wish I could get a hold of these regularly.
Just noticed I made it all the way though this review without saying "sour"... Its Sour folks! 1,325 charactersuno99, May 28, 2011

A - A deep amber with 2 fingers of khaki head, excellent retention, some legs.
S - slightly acetic, brett, and malt. cherries aren't really apparent in the nose anymore.
T - starts with nice sour cherry, but the belgian brown base is more noticeable at this age. Has a nice sweet finish with a bit of oak.
M/D - Medium carbonation with a medium body. Highly drinkable after your palate adjust a few sips in. Reminiscent of a Flanders Red, especially at this age with the cherries sitting further back. 
A great beer at this age, but I'm not sure if aging it longer will do it any good. 670 charactersxpimptastikx, May 28, 2011

Appearance. Clear deep amber with a little red. 1.5 fingers of frothy, off-white head that leaves some thick and fancy lacing.
Smell. Funky brett and sour cherries. Like a horse barn in a cherry orchard, in the hot sun. A little vinegar and belgian yeast funk. Pretty awesome. 
Taste. Nice sour punch. Some leather and sour cherries. Just a little vinegar. Red wine comes though in the end. Wasn't expecting the wine to compliment the sour flavours so well. Fantastic.
Mouthfeel. Medium body with awesome medium-strong, smooth, champange like carbonation.

4.53/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to J2Brew2 for this bottle. Probably my most-looked forward to RR sour.
Batch 04X2, brewed on 12/23/08, bottled 12/14/09. Just shy of the bottle-proclaimed 12-15 month barrel aging.
Poured into my Lost Abbey tulip. Mild haze to a garnet colored beer. Lively carbonation dances up from below to yield a tall foamy white head. The foam cap sticks around for several minutes, and leaves behind thick smearing swaths of lace. The bubbles are very fine and delicate looking. Once this grew to near room temperature it gained wonderful clarity for the style.
Smells very bretty though ripened black cherry does intermingle with this this yeast-driven beer. Very subtle vinegar notes as well as old leather and floral barnyard funk. Musty oak also adds some funk and caramel aromas.
The taste is where this beer truly shines. It begins faintly sweet and insanely sour. Supplication is a mouth-watering combination of several different yeasts that create a puckering first few sips. (The website claims this batch uses abbey yeast and wine yeast as well as brettanomyces.) Soon enough my palate adjusts and the real depth of flavor emerges.
The first several sips left me feeling disappointed. Suddenly I was thinking, "wow, maybe I was wrong about how good Jackie O's was with their sours - Russian River tastes about the same!" But once I adjusted to the tartness of the beer, I was relieved that this beer did indeed live up to the hype as one of the best American Wilds. To clarify - the JO's stuff is good, but Supplication is world class. 
Cherries are very prominent - both tart green acidic cherry, alongside ripened red summer cherries. This is wonderful because most 'cherry' beers either have no cherry flavor, or extremely artificial cherry flavor. Additionally, Supplication develops wonderful flavors of oak, very mild vanilla and cinnamon, and bitter clementine. Sweet notes of merlot and smokey pinot noir are also discernible.
The spry carbonation isn't overly assertive as I first feared. The beer finishes a little slick with some mouth-watering qualities stamping out the characteristic dryness associated with most of these type of sours. The acidity does grow with time into a small burning deep in my chest, but I have discovered that this seems to happen with just about any serious sour for me.
Overall an exceptional beer, and truly worthy of its praise. Easily my favorite Russian River offering to date. 2,442 charactersSpider889, May 24, 2011

Recieved this bottle from the very generous pokesbeerdude in a recent LIF I won. Thanks chuck! Poured into tuliped brandy snifter.
Pour yields a beautful amber chesnut reddish orange that shines in my glass. For an american wild, this is by far the most attractive I have seen.
Beautiful Noir qualities to this brew. You definitely get some of the sweet wine barrel, literally consumed by tart bing like cherries. Tart, acidic, a touch of funk, with some dark grapes and an excellent vinous character. The taste is sharp and sweet. A bit of pucker and some sweet fruits, oak, and those sweet sweet cherries. Carbonation was great for this beer. I wish there was a bit more bite in the flavor. Don't know why i'm hatin', it was delicious, just could have used a little more bite or intensity to set it over the top. Overall, this was one of the best brews of the day. Thanks again chuck! I have another one that I got as an extra from a great trader doverhills (Thanks Mark!) so I am looking forward to trying this batch with a little age, cheers! 1,091 charactersbackfat, May 23, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Thanks to vissai for the trade. Batch 6X1, bottled 5 Jan 2011 per the website.
Pours a clear deep coppery amber with a fluffy one-finger cream-colored head. Tons of carbonation flowing up from the bottom of the glass. Head retention and lacing are fantastic.
This is a feast for the nose. Sour cherries, a potent yeast punch, and a bit of funk. A ton of fruit. With every smell I get slightly different notes. The yeast and sour give it a bit of bite, but in general the smell is very smooth. Can't wait to taste it.
Starts out slightly sweet and fruity, with tart cherries dominating. Sour comes on shortly and remains throughout, rising to a crescendo in the finish. Finish is smooth, dry, and long. My main complaint is a lack of complexity.
Medium-light in body, high carbonation (but not too high). Silky in the mouth, somehow the flavors hold on long after the tactile sensation of the beer is gone. I suppose it forms a very thin layer that remains in the mouth. Quite good.
This is a great beer. The combination of sweet fruit and funky sour is fantastic. It's like a cross between a fruit beer and a wild. And I think the taste is the weakest aspect of it! Wish I could drink it more often. 1,204 characterszeledonia, May 23, 2011

Batch 5
Pours a hazy amber with just a touch of red to rosy it up.
Smells sour, slight funk, hint of cherries, very pleasant
Tastes tart, sour up front, transitioning into a very slight cherry sweetness before finishing dry. A near perfect blend of sour, dry, and slightly sweet cherry flavor. 
light crisp, but complex enough to not immediately fade. 
Excellent overall. I liked it better than temptation and consecration and maybe even better than Sanctification, which to this point had been my favorite sour-ish beer. Glad I have another couple of bottles 703 charactersCruisaC, May 18, 2011

In the glass it is very deep red and had almost no head. Fades quickly, not a whole lot of lacing.
The smell is great in its complexities. A whole lot of the outdoors up front with a little cherry hiding behind it all.
Sweeter than the other two Russian River offerings we shared this night, but has a good amount of the funky quality we hope to get from a wild right behind. Great sipping quality to try to pick different things out of. 
It is a great drinker with a god amount of carbonation, yet smooth feel going down.
Definitely something I want to drink more often than the yearly bottle I currently get. 627 charactersbenpopper, May 18, 2011

Pours a dark reddish brown with very little head. Held to the light, the beer shows an orange hue. 
Nose is pretty funky. The tart cherries lie beneath a nice layer of musty barnyard-type aromas and hints of oak. 
The taste has a lot going on. It starts slightly sweet, but immediately turns to funky. The finish is dry with a lingering acidic quality. All the parts play well together to paint a nice picture. 
Mouth is highly carbonated and bone dry. Champagne like. 
Overall, a wonderful American Wild. I'd love to see more breweries explore the style the way Russian River has. 766 charactersmondegreen, May 14, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Caged and corked 375 ml bottle. Poured into my Great Divide Brussels glass.
Beer pours a bright reddish orange with an almost non-existent layer of white head.
Aroma is tart and funky. The sour cherries shine through and there is also a prominent funky, lambic-esque smell as well. Although, as others have noted the smell is cleaner than your standard lambic.
Taste is insanely complex. The sour cherries immediately provide tartness and some lip puckering deliciousness. There is then some grassy, barnyardy-ness and then some subtle oak notes. A wine-like dryness finishes the sip. There's such complexity in the taste of this beer. It's outstanding.
The mouthfeel is dry and wine-like. Light carbonation. Very drinkable even when you take the tartness into account.
Overall, Supplication is a very interesting, complex and delicious beer. Definitely glad I was able to get hands on a bottle. 900 characterspburland23, May 14, 2011

A: An almost Ruby color. Poured the beer slowly & had very low head with highly active carbonation.
S: A bright cherry nose with a little bit of brett funk & wood mixed in.
T: This brew is quite tart. Definately finishes with some of that fuckyness, but in the best way possible.

4.03/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Received from a west coast connection and saw that it was listed as #16 all-time on BA... excited to try.
Visually, I appreciated this beer. Pretty burgundy color that made me pick up on the Pinot Noir aging right away.
The smell let me know right away that this might be more on the sour side than I anticipated from reading reviews.
Taste/mouthfeel reminds me of a belgian geuze. Super tart that leaves my tongue feeling thin. Was hoping for a little bit of a richer taste as this is more of a "wild ale" than a sour.
Overall I'm not blown away y this beer but can appreciate it for what it is. At the same time I'm a bit surprised that this came in so high all-time on the rankings. I'd grab for a Blind Pig from Russian River much quicker than I would for this. 769 charactersYagman3000, May 13, 2011

A: A rich rose/amber color that looks stunning when held up to the light. Small white head that dissipates rather quickly, head leaves a nice lacing on the glass. 
S: Smell number one is FUNK, and a lot of it, then the cherry shows up to the party. Then it just is a duet between the two, it’s very enjoyable. 
T: First sip makes the mouth pucker from the tartness; this is very dry wild ale also. Then once you get past the tartness and the dryness its all cherry and oak funk that floods the mouth. 
M: Ideal for a beer like this, it’s a little dry, but that is just what makes this so enjoyable. Carbonation is on par and the drinkability is amazing. 
O: This is one of my favorite Wild Ales on the market, and it’s nice that RR brews this and releases it a few times a year. Always nice to have a fresh back to drink and then a few to age. 926 charactersMrTopher, May 13, 2011

A: Very nice pop sound upon taking the cork out. Poured a deep copper/ruby color with a bunch of small bubbles being released to the top. A nice white head formed on top, made up of tiny bubbles. Great head retention and lacing. 
S: The aroma had a very nice tartness. The cherries were evident as was a slight funk and a little bit of wood. Even though it was tart there was a slight sweetness to it as well. 
T: The flavor profile is not as funky/barnyardy as I was expecting, not that its a bad thing. The tartness hits immediately with sour cherries. There is a slight sweetness to slightly balance the tart as well as a little bit of wood/oak to offset the fruit. 
M: Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Very smooth drinking and made me pucker a little bit. 
O: A nice treat to pop open on my birthday. An easy drinking beer with great flavor. Would be a nice beer to have on hand for certain occasions, but not something I want to drink everyday...but I wouldn't turn it down either. 1,042 charactersmdaschaf, May 11, 2011
3.63/5  rDev -19.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4375ml bottle...man, that's some thick glass. 
Pours lighter than I expected, but still a nice amber with a fairly dense head. The small snifter glass I was using really captured the foam and the aroma, which is...sour. Although not all cherry. While some cherry is present, I get more of an apricot or overripe persimmon. Some sweet caramel just barely on the end. 
Very small hints of strawberry and red plum in the flavors. Mostly sour bread, sour grapes and cherries. The pinot noir is subtle as is the cherry flavor. Not quire sure which cherries are used. Apricot comes and goes, and the caramel is summarily killed.
Sour, but not overly so. Not much sweetness on this one. Pretty darn good. 698 charactersMebuzzard, May 11, 2011

A: Crimson amber in color with a nice lasting almond colored head that forms a thick ring around the edges. Clarity is medium to good.
S: Obviously the first thing I smell is the funky brett aroma. It's not something you can really cover up, although it has to be one of the more pleasant brett beers I've had the pleasure of smelling as it's not overwhelming and compliments the other aromas nicely. There's some tartness to the nose too, probably from the pinot barrels, some cherries and a faint vanilla aroma along with an oaky woody essence.
T: Taste is of cherries, oak, kind of a sweet malt/vanilla backbone but very, very subtle. The wine/pinot essence comes through too as a kind of tartness, although this could be from the brett too. There's a slight alcoholic warmth to this as well. Very complex, and very balanced for the style.
M: Mouthfeel is great. Not too dry, just right. Carbonation is perfect. Finishes smooth.
O: Probably one of the best wild/brett ales I've had. Very delicious. I can't really complain about anything on this one. 1,226 charactersjulian, May 09, 2011

A - Its a dark amber colored with plenty of active carbonation that creates a nice 2 finger head.

T - The taste is a very nice tartness of cherries and hints of oak.
M - Medium to light bodied, fairly light on the carbonation. Finish is very dry, and delicious.

Smell. You sure this is beer? lol. Smells of heavy influence of the wine barrel. Slight tone of fruit.
Taste. WOW. Holey f*ck. 4 years ago, regardless of the $12 price point I would have poured this beer out. Now, understanding the process that made this beer it is impressive. This is a palette cleanser. This is like wine and beer had an affair and this is the illegitimate child from that process. Very tart and sour with plenty of pinot noir tones. 
Mouthfeel. Tart, dry, semi bitter. SOUR. very nice.
Overall: If you are in search of a sour beer, this is one of the tops, This will light your taste buds up like licking a 9 volt battery!And thats about it, not much for flavor, price point is off by a mile, and this is something that you would rather have a sample of, not too many people would sit down and enjoy this beer IMO, this is one you split between 5 or 6 people just to say you've had it. 987 charactersalexhahn82, May 08, 2011

Served chilled into Bruery tulip
Batch 6
*reviewed from memory of last night's impromptu sour tasting
Appearance: Earthy crimson color, with some definite influence from the barrel for color, and lots of ruby from the cherries. Awesome off-white head sticks around a while, and slowly recedes and leaves some pretty nice lacing. This beer certainly has a very "classic" appearance, for lack of a better word, and is a sexy beer to sit an look at.
Smell: Right off the bat, the cherries come through the nose very strongly, as does the oak. The beer is definitely holding some really vinous-pinot notes on the nose, along with some relatively tame "funk." The "funk" comes through to me, as a sort of clean earthiness, which compliments the cherry so well.
Taste: The cherries are definitely holding their own still! Nice and tart, leading into a more focused sourness which is accompanied by the oak. There are hints of a vanilla quality on the finish, which accompanied with the dryness, make for a really enjoyable sour experience. Makes me sad I only had one bottle of this, and a 12 oz. bottle at that...
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, while being a tad bit on the sticky side; which is very welcomed here. Very nice carbonation, and all the characteristics of sours working together to make this beer extremely enjoyable.
Overall: Simply amazing!! I had wanted to try this beer for a very long time, and upon finally getting the chance, i was worried i would have built it up too much in my expectations. Certainly not the case though, this is a stellar beer. I love the complexity that this beer holds, and i love knowing how much time and effort went into making it. I will without a doubt be getting this again in the near future... 1,879 charactersamcmaho1, May 08, 2011

Batch 004x5 - 375ml
I had yet to try this beer and recently acquired my first one through a trade (thanks 6DaysBottomOcean!). I couldn't hold out for too long and decided to crack this one open tonight. 
Upon removing the cage, just the slightest bit of force sent the cork flying.
A - Pours a deep amber with ruby highlights when held to the light. Pillowy off-white one-finger head that slowly dissipates to reveal itself, leaving sticky lacing around the glass.
S - Tart cherries, pinot, oak from the barrels that nursed this beer as it aged. The funk from the Brett is evident, though balanced nicely. 
T - Sweet, tart cherries. Sour, yet balanced extremely well with the oak, I pick up hints of vanilla. Finish is dry, my mouth is watering, craving more. 
M - Medium bodied, wonderful carbonation that truly is an asset to the complex flavors at play. 
O - This beer is truly a treat and one that I will be seeking out in earnest. 952 charactersRSchaeffer, May 06, 2011

A: As always I poured it gently into my snifter and was rewarded with a finger of white head. The head doesn't stick around too long . It looks like carbonated cherry juice. 
S: Sour cherries, red wine, some oak, a little brett. Its got complexity on its side. 
T: Tart cherry, oak flavors and just the right amount of brett funkiness all blended together perfectly. Definitely some wine comparisons. Its sour but not overwhelmingly so. 
M: Light bodied and surprisingly very refreshing. 
O:Had this on tap a few times at Monk's and I always seem to pick one up when I go to the bottle shop. Definitely my favorite of the -tions.

Pours an amber color, good clarity with active carbonation. A clingy white foam is very active at first, but dies down to sticky lacing fairly quick. The aromas are very cool, lots of funk and sour fruit. The taste is decadent, very mellow with active bubbles that fizz on first contact with the tongue. Quickly the onset of sour cherry and orange peel take over with a very complex finish that leaves a lasting and changing funk in your mouth. Nice acidity, not overpowering, very well crafted sour. 519 charactersTripphop, May 05, 2011

I had an hour or so to kill so I ordered an espresso to drink and hang out with (comped for buying three bags of coffee, sweet!) Then I looked at the tap list... Supplication for, wait for it, $6 a ten ounce pour! At one point I had a shot of espresso, a glass of water, and my goblet of Russian River sour sitting in front of me at the same time. Scanning through my reviews I see I've never reviewed this beer. Time to remedy that. 
A: Clear ruby-amber, slightly dirty white thick wisp ring, surprisingly decent lacing. 4.5/5
S: Heavy on the lactic, vanilla, light funk, sweet pie cherries. 4.5/5
T: Here's where the wood comes in a little heavier. Strong vanilla notes, the expected sour cherries, a touch of ripe cheese rind funk, again with a decent dose of lactic acid, slight grape skin tannins, overall a very nice American Wild flavor profile. 4.5/5
M: Fuller than expected with soft carbonation, I wish this wasn't as sticky of a finish but I'm nit-picking. It's pretty dead on for the style. 4/5
O: A solid beer I always enjoy. Today's no exception. As good as they make them in America. For $6 a glass, I'd drink this more often. At $12 a bottle, I'm not buying one of these too frequently.

Russian River Supplication - American Wild Ale - 7% abv
A: Thick three finger head wit a red character to it, light amber with plenty of carbonation, sediment bouncing lazily throughout the glass
S: tart sour notes of bitter cherry and merlot. there's a funk to it, a bit of wet dog, but a sweet wet dog, in taste not disposition
T: Sweet introductory flavor with a strong wave of bitter tartness that is resonant of a sour patch kid, but refined with an aged pinot noir, the taste moves swift with incredible balance, the hops are so minor that they serve more as an escort to serparate the flavors than to impart authority, again the main perk is the incredible balance of sour with the underlying sweet
M: The mouthfeel is just malty enough to carry the sediment and sweet dryness of the beer, any more and it would become a decadent fruit overload, any less and it would travel to a forgettable cider, the perfect balances makes this beer fantastic without overstaying its welcome. The taste imparts a swift jab of sour notes and then quickly resides, like a berry sniper.
D: Some people may feel that the sweet notes are not high enough and the sour creates a poor man's wine experience, I couldn't disagree more. This is incredibly drinkable, not in the power hour sense, in a strictly delightful sense, the type that makes you wish for a couple bombers of, or a huge wallet to acquire these gems. This would find itself equally at home on a boat in the sun, or after a ski trip in the lodge. Incredibly drinkable.
Narrative: The clicking roll and an L2 against an L3 vertebrae makes a percussive click clack with a certain panache that only Briscoe Wellingstone, berryspy extraordinaire can evoke. Some errant sour juice dribbles from the guard's mouth, but Kiwis weren't fit to guard a hostile embassy. He was hired as a young tart currant, trained in the most hostile vineyards, and was raised a pedigree in solitude for 15 months. Only this sour aging could create an agent of such brackish authority, such swiftly petulany candor, bitterly imparting a smooth sourness to the political fruit world. He rounds the foyer of the Tropicanaria, resolute to steal the famed cherry pit of Largesse. A hardened fruit son of a bitch, but with a slippery smoothe discountenance, lovable, yet stern in his demeanor. Mr. Wellingstone peppers the security cameras during an arching slide across the marble flooring. The pit was obtained, a sour finish left in the museum curator's mouth. 2,664 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, May 04, 2011

I'm bracing myself for this one. As many fine beers that I've tried now, this was absolutely my first time ever trying this one.
I need to thank my good buddies Huhzubendah and biglobo8971 for BOTH sending me bottles of this renowned sour.
Batch 005X1 poured into a tulip at cellar temperature.
No working around of the cork necessary.... this sucker just popped right away!
A: Dark amber color, with ruby highlights when held up to a light source. Mildly off-white head became an oblong bubble formation as it died down.
S: The barrel-aging was evident from the get-go. Brett was totally prominent, but not ridiculous. Sour cherries for sure, along with a good bit of pepper.
T: Mildly jaw-locking, with the RR taste profile on the forefront in spades! The barrel-aging definitely tamed the over the top sourness. Mildly wine-like, but not totally.
M: Definitely carbonated and then some, but much more so than than a fine wine. Fairly thick! I didn't find this one vinegary in the least and was totally state of the art in the Mouthfeel category!
O: This one has earned its place as one of the best sours on the market. Amazing stuff! 1,206 charactersChaney, Apr 30, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 006X1.
Poured into my newly acquired Russian River belgian glass.
Appearance: Pours a deep reddish/brown mix. About a three quarter finger off white head. A lot of carbonation bubbles from all over the glass. The head does not recede quickly at all. Bubbles in the head are tiny and tightly packed together, looks very nice. However the head has grown to a full finger and will not recede at all, getting a little annoying.
Smell: Dark fruit. Tartness. Some nice funkiness, the brett character really sticks out.
Taste: Strong sourness right off the bat but the sourness seems to fade quickly. Sour cherries. Mouth waters with every sip. Characteristics of the wine come through moreso in the aftertaste. Following the wine is this mix between brett and breadiness. Every sip leaves me wanting more. Tangy. Sourness decreases as the beer warms, but the tartness remains strong.
Mouthfeel: Nice body but it changes over the time spent in the glass. The carconation is released quickly so the first sips are quite carbonated and has a bite from the bubbles. Later on, the carbonation bite is less but the beer smoothes out.
Overall: I am loving sours and this sure helps my experience with them. I liked Consecration more than this but this is still a solid brew. I would gladly take more. I cant wait to see how the other one in my "cellar" matures. 1,359 charactersOddNotion, Apr 29, 2011
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 5x4. Poured in a Duvel tulip. Courtesy of a trade with CHILLINDYLAN. 
Pours a well carbonated orange/red. 
Sour cherries (with a vinous quality) are dominant on the nose. Some sweetness to balance the sour. 
The vinous qualities mix with the sour cherries on the tongue. Lactic sourness more than acetic, but not puckeringly so. Light to medium feel, crisp carbonation keeps things from getting heavy. The sourness builds as my glass empties, but the sweetness holds on (barely). Not much funk. Dry and a hint of oak on the finish. (Ok, maybe I puckered a bit). Well integrated flavors, just the right sweet and sour balance. Well crafted is the best way to put it. 
I've had all 3 of the regular RR sours several times. This is my favorite. I always wonder how hyped this beer would be if it were brewed once with cherries from some tree that died. 859 characterscaskstrength, Apr 28, 2011

Appearance - Beautiful orangish brown color, with bubbly white head.
Smell - good, sour, vineger, and cherries, I am not getting a ton of the barrel in the nose, but overall very pleasant.
Taste - delicious sweet tart like cherry with a variety of additional dark fruits fruits and earthiness. Subtle notes from the barrel come through as it warms. 
Mouthfeel - very bubbly and compliments the style.
Overall - Fantastic, I have been slowly getting more and more into this style and after having this one I am hooked. Absolutely a world class beer. 592 characterspmoore311, Apr 26, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Number 3 on my Russian River -ation quest.
Pours an orange amber with a tight bubbled head.
Smells of a sour sweet-tart candy.
Tart cherries, and more tart fruits. His one hits you in the jaw. A decent sweetness helps round off the sour, balancing the beverage. Dry crisp finish. This one reminds me of a tart brut. Booze is everso whispering to the palette. 
Tight carbonation only further compliments the sour cherries.
 This is a great beverage. Russian River's experimentation and attention to detail pays off. 514 charactersdbmernin83, Apr 25, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a golden orange brown. Very bright when held to the light. It was poured into a tulip glass and it had about a two finger white head. A bit of sediment floating in there as well. 
Nose comes off with a medium amount of vinegar at first. A mouthwatering tartness wafts up to the nose and begs for a sip. Some attic mustiness and a rich carameliness.
Sourness comes first in the taste followed by a whipcrack of Brett. Finally finished by a decent amount of sweetness. This beer has a decent amount of residual sugars in it. 
Only the slightest hint of vanilla shows from a very old wet wood note and the mustiness once again from the nose. Some esters mostly including apples and tart cherries. 
To wrap this up(in comclusion) this beer is medium bodied with ample carbonation. It has a syrupy mouthfeel and a mouthwatering sweet/sour flavor profile acompanied by all of complexities that you'd look for in a beer as deserving as this. 943 characterscooch69, Apr 25, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 004x1 from the bottle on Easter.
A: Pours a beautiful dark golden brown, with a ruby hue. The head sticks around a very long time, and leaves sticky lacing on the walls of the glass.
S: Funk leads the charge, followed by a potent tart cherry. There is sone band-aid in the middle. Sweet cherries wrap up the nose.
T: There isn't as my funk as the nose suggests, it's more acidic. Dark fruits dominate tour mid-palate, mostly cherries and plums, before giving way to some funk at the end.
M: Prickly carbonation assists the various flavors. Medium bodied.
D: After having Batch 005 on tap yesterday, I'd say the fresher this beer, the better. When the beer is fresh, the fruit flavors or more vibrant, but the sourness and funkiness levels are a little less abrasive. This beer is delicious at any age, but out of the three batches I've had, I'd rank them in the following order (best to worst): 003, 005, 004 919 charactersaglose45, Apr 24, 2011

A: Pours a clear dark reddish orange with good carbonation and off white head that leaves plenty of lacing around the glass.
S: Tart cherries and sour barnyardy funk dominate with some oak and malt notes in the background.
T: Tart cherry flavors are carried all over my mouth on a wave of acidic sour funk with hints of oak, red wine and sweet malt. Delicious mouth puckering goodness. Very sour yet you can still taste all of the complexities with each little sip. The tart cherries and oak flavors linger in my mouth and each time I lick my lips I get hit with more delicious sourness and cherries. This is divine.
M: Very sour, smooth and balanced medium-light body that finishes crisp and dry.
O: One of my all time favorite sours. So many great clean and distinct layers of flavor make me keep wanting to take another sip. Exceptional ale that I simply can not get enough of. 983 charactersAzurescens, Apr 22, 2011

S: Nice and tart on the nose with some cherries, wood, a hint of bubblegum, a little marzipan and a bit of funk.
T: I had this a while back on tap and was blown away. Now that I've gotten to try some more of RRs sours, I'm even more blown away because, somehow, this is better than any of the others I've had (and I really like the others). 
T: Huge sourness with some sweet malts in the background. The finish is dry with a hint of nuttiness. The sourness is a combination of apple cider vinegar and sour cherries for me and is incredible. This is such an amazing beer. 646 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 21, 2011

A: cloudy coppery amber with a thick finger of off-white head that fades to leave thick lacing at the edge of the glass. good carbonation throughout the body of the beer, visible despite the cloudiness. 
N: notes of cherry, citrus, and vinegar. 
T/M: follows the smell; very tart and sour with hints of lemon, cherry and a bit of tobacco (probably from the oak) in the middle. the beer finishes very sour, but well balanced. body is smooth, and the carbonation helps to mellow the tartness a bit, but overall the beer is very dry and bites with acidity. 
i really like this sour a lot. it is quite a bit milder than Consecration is, but still features all the flavor notes i love in the Consecration. 
(forgot to write down the batch number on this bottle, but i am pretty sure it is the same as the one i have in cellar.) 935 characterspeacebone116, Apr 19, 2011

Appearance: Pours a very cloudy reddish amber with a layer of off white head. There is some nice lacing here.
Smell: Reminds me of bubble gum and vinegar, in a good way. Fruity notes including sour cherry and mild banana. Tart and very sour.
Taste: Lives up to the smell. Very sour with hints of tart lemon and citrus. A bit fruity and mildly sweet, the finish is very sour, great balance of flavors.
Mouthfeel: Medium body. There is a high amount of carbonation but it is very smooth. The finish is quite dry.
Overall: Very good well balanced beer. I could feel the sourness in my jaw with each sip I took. Another great sour from Russian River. 698 charactersoline73, Apr 19, 2011

Tart sour aroma without being nauseating. I say that cause I am so not a sour fan. Those horse blanket sour beers make me sick. This however has some acetic character with being overpowering. 
Ok stick to style here... Nice tight sourness which finishes quite dry. Cherries make a nice addition. Soften the sharpness without dulling the effect. 
Wish I could say more but I only got this out of respect for how well regarded RR sour beers are. And to be honest, this is fantastic. Met be some type of sour that I don't agree with, but it's non existent here. Supremely enjoyable. 737 charactersjoecast, Apr 16, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - pour is a very nice two finger dark amber colored cascading head. Plenty of active carbonation keeps the head up for several minutes.
S - huge whiff of Brett funk first smell that overpowers everything else. Underneath that you get a bit of cherry with oak and a touch of bready yeast.
T - a very well balanced mix of Brett and cherries that go together extremely well. Many breweries fail with the addition of cherries, it is really almost always a miss for me. This is a definite exception. A very nice tartness accompanies this beer, about the level of eating a fresh tamarind. As it warms oak adds another layer of complexity.
M - medium to light bodied, fairly light on the carbonation in the mouth which always works for me in sours because high carbonation makes me believe my teeth are going to rot out. Finish is very dry and oaky, and delicious. Mouth wateringly delicious.
O - If you are a fan of the style this is a must have beer. If you are just getting into the style this may be a bit intense but should give you some good hindsight about the style. This is a very well crafted brew and worthy of being called one of the best beers in the world. 1,169 charactersdfclav, Apr 16, 2011

Pours a light cloudy salmon pink with hints of more robust coppers and morning plum, a finger of head with a little retention. Nose is nice and bretty, light cherries, hint of vinegar, light woody barrel notes.
Wine-grape like flavors, light vinegar, sour cherries, caramel, hint of vanilla, not-quite-ripe tropical fruits, low acidity with some champagne effervescence, light grassy and funky brett, some wood. Tart but not over the top; Good sweetness to balance, quite a round pillowy body for the style, makes it drink like a charm.

S-Mostly you get the typical sour ale smell with a hint of wood.
T-Very complex. You get flavors of wood and wine along with the tartness from the brett and the lacto and pedio bacteria. 
M-Tart, very dry, almost no fruit sweetness. Lots of bubbles.
Overall, very complex beer. I enjoy sours a great deal and this is the best I've had for the style. Sometimes it's nice to have a sour that has more sweetness but this has a very winelike character and lots of different flavors. 614 charactersadman08, Apr 15, 2011

A small but nice off white head out of the bottle, foamy, falls slowly but maintains a real nice collar throughout drinking. Great body color again on these Wild Ale's from Russian River. Body is slightly cloudy, but a beautiful dark orange and brown with great hues. Fantastic looking beer here.
Smell is a little muted and small but, wonderful pleasant sour and acid. Small fruit cherry, and there's this very good sense of pine needles or something spicy, I get pine though and stinging. 
Taste is a real nice bodied sour, with small cherry fruit. Good tartness, a bit dry in the mouth after some sips, Has an almost hint of malt on the swallow, but a good black pepper spice too that carries. Very balanced, not overpowering, everything is in play here.
Fantastic wild ale here, would have this again anytime with food or without. Balanced, not overpowering, great body, tasty brew! 978 characterssmakawhat, Apr 15, 2011

A Pours a light brown color that has a smallish head that dissipates quickly. 
S A very funky sour smell combined with notes of fruit especially cherries. 
T As the smell suggests the taste is very sour. There are notes of cherry and some wine with an acidic bite. Some sweetness on the finish. 
M The mouthfeel is puckering to say the least. It leaves the same feeling in the mouth that one gets after eating sour candy. 
Overall this beer is strange yet amazing at the same time. It's quite a unique beer that you will either love or hate and I love it. It's so far from what most people consider the norm yet it is absolutely delicious. One of my new favorites. 720 charactersbeerandcycling88, Apr 13, 2011

tart cherries, sweet malts, red wine vinegar, sweet fruits, dark berries, light wood, "cherry coke" as the girlfriend says.
damn thats tart. takes a minute for the palate to adjust, but when it does some sweetness creeps in. vinegar, cherries, caramel, toffee, not-quite-ripe tropical fruits, some wine-like grape flavors, acidity with some champagne effervescence. 
mouth-puckering with a cotton-candy feel. almost feels like the prickliness after the Novocaine wears off after a visit to the dentist.
wonderful, wonderful beer. perhaps a bit too sour for the uninitiated, and perhaps a bit too fruity for the sour-lovers, but a great balance and an impressive beer, now only if I could get it more readily. 862 characterssilentjay, Apr 12, 2011

4.63/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Batch 006 (bottle says 006X1). 375 mL. Poured into my Stone Old Guardian Barleywine goblet. My favorite glass these days - works wonderfully with several different styles, especially puckery ones like IPAs, DIPAs and SOURS.
I actually pulled this one out of the fridge because I had a greasy quesadilla from a Lincoln Heights Mexican hole-in-the-wall up on North Broadway called Carnitas Michoacan. Needed something acerbic to settle the stomach. This one fit the bill nicely.
Poured like the red-orange hues of the sunset. Really a beautiful color, the red must be coming from the cherries. Respectable white head, really great lacing. This bottle came out nicely and perfectly conditioned.
Smells like mouth-wateringly tart cherries, some vague sweetness and the oak is definitely present.
Wow, this one is sour, but it's nice. The sour cherries are dominant here, there's some mild sweetness, which provides some balance making this one more pleasant. The oak starts to come to the forefront and then begins to recede in the follow, but lingers in the aftertaste. The oak really does a great thing for this brew - sometimes this barrel aging stuff gets a little gimmicky, but this is right on. It adds wonderful complexity - the cherries and the oak infused with a quality sour are what makes this beer something quite special.
Mouthfeel is fairly light in body, decent carbonation, but also a bit of a softness.
I could drink a good amount of this. It's really good, complex and interesting, but remarkably drinkable. Makes me really happy.
I'm a learner in the sour department, but this beer converted me to the style. I enjoyed it and rushed out the next day to procure another bottle. This will be a beer I'll seek out as a regular whenever it's available. 1,770 charactersghetto90007, Apr 11, 2011

This beer is extremely effervescent; tons of carbonation. Both lacing and retention are great. Very good looking beer.
Smell: Lots of funk shows up immediately here, as well as lighter vinegar and sour lemon notes. I also get quite a bit of fruitiness to offset the sour; mainly tart cherries, but also some citrus.
Taste: The taste is decidedly more sour than the nose is. Lots of funk and sour lemon notes. The tart cherry flavors are there, but are more muted, and I get less citrus components on the palate than on the nose. Great tasting beer though, the funk and sourness are quite pleasing.
Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is light, carbonated and bubbly. Very crisp and refreshing. Overall, this is a great wild ale. Really nice balance between fruit and sour. I've got both Temptation and Consecration and am interested to see what I like the best. 968 characterszhanson88, Apr 10, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a juicy amber red, clouded with biotics. Head is bubbly and swirled. There's probably no bottle more enticing than an RR sour's, or maybe my response is just Pavlovian. Either way the cork and cage are definitely appropriate here.
Aroma is just step away from that of Temptation. Mostly must and hay, sawdust covered floorboards. I've heard such smells compared to cheese, fungus, sweat, and the always descriptive "funk," "barnyard," and "horse blanket." Luckily there is a pleasant backdrop here of cherry, apricot and peach, suggesting that us sour-lovers are at least not completely off our rockers.
This is by far the most delicious wild ale I've ever had. Keyword here is "refreshing." Balancing out the sour notes are sweet stone-fruit and assertive oak. Describing the sour flavor is more difficult. I'm not getting much of an acetic vibe here, the pungence is more easily ascribed to whitish grapefruit rind without the bitters. Vivid carbonation really props up the intensity of this beer. Certainly worth the price, and that's saying something for me. Superb. 1,078 charactersbohemiandonut, Apr 09, 2011

A: Pours a hazy amber with red highlights. The head is off-white in color and about two fingers thick and slowly dissipates, leaving some nice lacing down the side of the glass.
S: The scent has a powerful cherry aroma right off the bat, sort of a tartness as well. Also slight hints of yeast are present but they are faint.
T: The taste is much like the smell, the upfront taste is cherries, cherries and more cherries with a bit of the tartness coming through and sticking around. The finish has a bit of yeast and some wood with a bit of dryness coming in as well.
M: Light to medium bodied with bubbly carbonation that really tingles the palate. Tart feel throughout.
D: This beer is very solid, very crisp and smooth. It's "sour" but not overwhelmingly sour, but it's present so expect some bite to it. Although I don't have many sour ales under my belt, I'd say this is one of the better examples. 969 charactersmavbrew, Apr 09, 2011

4.88/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5375ml bottle, batch 04x1, poured into a Bruery tulip glass at around 45-50 degrees. This is a bit over a year old at this point, I've been saving it a while to see how it has changed.
Pours a rich mahogony with a very light tan tinged head. Miniscule carbonation rises from the bottom, keeping afloat the one finger width of very fine froth on top. Fantastic clarity, excellent retention, and crazy lacing. In a word - perfect.
Initial aroma impressions include red wine vinegar, grape skin, red currants, maraschino cherries, and wood. Digging deeper I'm finding green apple, raisin, and some sourness mixed with barnyard funk. Quite complex indeed.
Red wine is the first thing I taste, but that quickly succumbs to a sour burst of cherries. Underneath the puckering sourness is a bit of balsamic vinegar, but it's kept in check thankfully. The back end presents a bit of the brown ale malts with some faint caramel and bready bits. There's a bit of leather, earth, funky straw, hay and grass to wrap it all up into a big package of awesomeness.
The best mouthfeel of any American Wild Ale I've ever had. I attribute it mostly to how microscopically small the bubbles are, creating a soft and smooth feeling across my tongue. The body feels slick, with a proper viscosity that is right within the means.
I think this is the best experience I've had to date with this beer, so I'd definitely recommend aging a bottle for a year and a half. This is the most balanced sour beer I can remember having, with all sorts of flavors and smells to pick up that can too often be covered up by a cloying sourness. I always told my parents I wanted to be a Blue Angels pilot when I grew up, but now I just want to be Vinnie Cilurzo. 1,725 charactersBubba83, Apr 04, 2011

Lively bubbling. Little lacing. Very graceful looking. Smells sweet and sour like peach nectar and white vinegar. Some white grape juice. Some nondescript Belgian spiciness and oak. Sour cherry isn't what I think of when I smell it, but sour cherries tend to smell different than "cherry smell" anyway.
Tastes deliciously fresh with a serious sourness up front which cleans up to a gentle mealy malt finish. Some sour cherry and grape to the flavor, but everything is very well-integrated. Slight meatiness. Hints of mineral water on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lively and light with huge volume-adding waves of carbonation. Very drinkable, flavorful but clean.
Overall I quite like this beer. Really wished I lived closer to where this was sold on the shelves. 886 charactersabuliarose, Apr 04, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Special thanks to Kingkong for hooking me up with this bottle. 375mL marked as batch 006x1
A: Supplication is mahogany in color, and pours with a quickly fading head. Despite my every attempt at coaxing some sort of froth out of the brew, it remains still after only a few moments. It is clear in the glass, and boasts plenty of lacing.
S: A marvelous bouquet of cherries, rose, Pedro Ximenez, and balsamic is presented elegantly. I can already tell that this is going to be a treat.
T: Delightfully dry, and pleasantly tart, Supplication is packed with oak, raisin, barnyard funk, almond, and a touch of sour cherries. I actually think that the cherry flavor comes from the yeast, while the cherries themselves add to the sherry/raisin tones. There is also a delightful earthiness that I feel is added by the Pinot Noir trapped in the barrels.
M: Light, dry, effervescent, and a touch tannic.
D: A great brew to say the least. This is balanced in its tartness, impressive in both its breadth and depth of flavor, and yet, remains distinct from the sour ales of Belgium. I couldn't justifiably classify this Lambic nor flanders ale; it is its own style. Definitely worth a try if you are fortunate enough to have access to RR's brews, as it is a great example of America's ability to take the best parts of other brewing traditions while adding our own flair. 1,364 charactersAvagadro, Apr 03, 2011

Smell: Predominately barnyard funk. Some tart citrus-y notes
Taste: Tart cherries and grapefruit. Slight Belgian funk in the taste, though I might have carried some yeast over into the Tulip.
Mouth-feel: Medium body with a high level of carbonation.
Overall: Excellent taste with a fair measure of sourness. one of my first introductory sours that I'm finally reviewing. Russian River always comes through on the sours. 512 charactersIKR, Apr 01, 2011

Poured into a Russian River "tion" glass because I will not have it any other way. Pours a rather hazy golden apricot color with a bright white head. Smell like a goddamn delicious river in the hills of Russia. Some funk and hints of peach behind some fragrant cherry notes. Taste is fortunately the same and this is a rather refreshing beverage. Spot-on carbonation with lighter medium body. Thanks Matt! 536 charactersLunch, Mar 28, 2011

4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked up several Russian River offerings during a trip to California earlier this year. Batch 04X4. 
Appearance - A hazy peachy color fills my Great Divide tulip glass. A nice two-finger head formed which resolved to a 1/4in ring. A bit of lacing but not enough to mention. 
Smell - Bright and clean aroma on the nose. Cherries, funky brett and lacto along with a complex matrix of malty sweetness and woody/grassy components from the aging. 
Taste - Let the first sip coat your palate to prepare you for what lies ahead. You will be shocked by the bold and for many a "non-beer" profile. For those who thirst for wild ales, you have found your holy grail. Lively cherries tart and tangy contributions from brett, lacto and pediococcus coat your tongue with the harsh yet refreshing tastes of a musty barn added to leather and grassy notes. This sits on the back of your tongue and requests that another mouthful joins in on the fun. Snaps of sweet malt and tart intermingle throughout the sampling of this fine beverage. My goodness, this is beer like many of you have never (yet need to) experience. The alcohol is non-existent. 
Mouthfeel - The carbonation well transports the offering around your mouth. Very nice density with a crisp finish. 
Overall - Why did I only bring six back with me.... This is an outstanding wild ale. Crisp and clean, tart on your tongue. Just try to name all of the smells and flavors you experience with this offering. 1,458 charactersNesued, Mar 26, 2011
4.21/5  rDev -6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 375mL bottle into a HotD tulip on 3/25/11
Pours a beautiful dark amber color that has a wonderful mix of orange and red hues when held to the light. About a half a finger of head that just sticks around. Very nice.
Smells great. Lots of sour cherry and sweet malt tones that makes this a joy to smell.
Taste is much like the smell. Lots of mouth puckering cherry and a tiny bit of sweet malt taste.
Mouthfeel is medium with a nice easy carbonation. Just the lightest bite on the middle of the tongue.
Drinkability is good on this one. Low ABV and a great mouth feel are pluses but even though it tastes great I don't think I could take more then 2 of these at a time because of the mouth puckering sour sensation. 732 charactersUMNbeerhunter, Mar 25, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this a couple months back, but decided to rereview while sharing with AwYeh.
Vintage: Batch 005x1
Pours a darker orange/red than I expected, with a foamy head that retains pretty well and leaves decent lacing. This looks a lot like Pliny the Elder actually.
Smells of tart cherries, Brett, and a bit of barnyard funk. Cherries are lacking that cordial sweetness and are definitely of the sour variety. Oaky wood comes through as well.
Tart, sour cherries assault the palate at the start but fade to a semi-sweet fruity body before it gets to be too much. Acidic, puckering and awesome start. The middle is very juicy cherries, plenty of Brett, a lot of oak, and a fair amount of sour citrus as well. Winy character is present throughout and a great complement to everything else. Finish is a solid 50/50 of sweetness and sourness that lingers until the next sip.
Mouthfeel is acidic, but not overly so. The feel is balanced by some sugary character and the fruits somehow. Drinkabiility is very, very good for such a strong, sour beer - the balance mentioned earlier is a boon to this category. Your mouth doesn't get killed by the acidity in this as much as in some other strong sours, and it lets the beer be drinkable for a long period of time. If you haven't had a wild ale, have this and you'll be sold on the style. 1,330 charactersveinless, Mar 24, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Wow I was really surprised by this beer. I thought the cherries were going to be too much for this beer and ruin it but I was so mistaken the cherries really make this beer great. The color is a nice deep brown. Slight sourness and cherries plus some malty sweetness are the aromas that greet your nose. These same flavors come through in the taste plus a few other notes that hard to truly pick out. I could see a few years really helping this beer balance out and become even better. Great to drink now but some age will just make it that much better.

Taste: Tart, sour cherries, vinegar, bretty funk, finishes sweet. 
Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied and sharp.
Drinkability: I love this beer. I think it's my favorite out of the three readily available Russian River sours (although it is very close). I pick this up whenever I see it. 557 charactersAxic10, Mar 22, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5Mad thanks to nickd717 for this beer I've been waiting ages to try.
Batch 006
A: Pours a perfectly translucent reddish-orange color with a good amount of off white head. Head looks creamy, retention is good and lacing is really good.
S: WOW! This is complex! The brett are more than evident in the smell with all the musky notes associated with it (horse blanket among others) as well as a lactic acidity (thanks to the bacteria used). Vinous and oaky notes are very present thanks to the Pinot noir aging. Some red wine vinegar. The cherries are also very evident in the smell as well as the tartness you'd expect with a wild ale. Vanilla and lemon zest are in this, but not as much in the front than the other smells. Somewhat comparable to a very fresh bottle of Duchesse de Bourgogne (less vinegar). As it warms up, the malt base really came out with some caramel.
T: Dayum, this is really really sour. As it enters the mouth, you're attacked by the puckering acidity. The cherries are more present than in the smell and blends perfectly with a less strong taste of horse blanket than expected from the smell. Again, this is quite vinous and the oak tannins make it even more evident of the use of wine barrels. Very tart (d'uh!). The vanilla and lemon zest are still there, but there is also lemon juice (and a LOT of it). As it warms up, the malt base came forward more with some sweetness.
M: Light body with medium carbonation. Nowhere as light and fluffy as the Cantillon offerings (that I thought was the perfect fit for the dryness of the beer and its acidity), but still is a decent fit for the beer. 
O: This beer packs a punch. Sour noobs be aware this is EXTREMELY sour. Very drinkable and perfectly balanced between the fruits, the acidity, the funkyness. This is an exceptional offering from Russian River, definitely one of my favorite beers of all time. 1,878 charactersflipper2gv, Mar 21, 2011

A - Pours a very dark orange-brown with a thick and creamy off-white head that never fully dissipates. Leaves sudsy lacing as it recedes. Very pretty!
S - Excellent aromas of tart cherries, oak, caramel malt, and funky microbial tartness. It's tough to really make out individual aromas, this is more of a heavenly marriage between all the best Lambics, Krieks, and Flanders Reds.
T - Wow, you know how I said this smelled like some kind of blend of Lambic, Kriek, and Flanders Red? It tastes exactly the same! Cherries, oak, brown sugar, tobacco, caramel, red wine, and funk with just the right amount of tartness. Amazingly complex, this could be a deserted-island beer!
M - Quite slick, with a medium body and crisp, sharp carbonation. Nicely dry and tannic finish, much like a red wine.
O - Well, what more can I say? This was an amazing beer, easily one of the most flavorful, complex, and nuanced I've ever had. Another home run from Russian River! 1,009 charactersjsanford, Mar 19, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +7.3%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Orange-ish amber in color, 1.5 finger head thins out but sticks around. Good lace.
S- Cherries, oak, earthiness, hint of vinegar, and some wine-y qualities. Exactly how I want a sour to smell, seriously complex but nothing abrasive 
T- If there is one thing this beer does better than aroma it is taste. Initial lightly tart and sweet cherry and light oak-iness fades into an earthy funk, that is briefly overtaken by a flash of strong citric tart flavor from the sour lacto. As the strong tartness peters off, the funk kicks again towards the end, culminating in an extremely satisfying dry finish. 
M- Very nice mouthfeel, extremely fine, spritzy carbo that is reminiscent of champagne. This fine carbo and medium body make for a silky smooth sip that allows all of this beer's amazing flavors to shine through.
Overall- This beer is a testament to the idea that brewing is as valid an art as any. As a beer with unbridled complexity that leaves you wanting more after each sip, Supplication is a memorable experience that is well worth the high price. 1,061 charactersanchordrinker, Mar 16, 2011

A-pours a vibrant dark amber with nice red glow to it. The head is a thick and creamy off white leaving a strong lace on the side of the glass.
S-light acidity up front, notes of oak and brett play together, sour cherries come in behind. the aromas are simple yet well integrated.
T-here the brett comes in first, light leathery notes, good dry oak presence that doesn't detract but adds to it, sour cherries are so juicy and vibrant. almost no acidity but a nice bit of sourness to it.
M-medium to light body, very smooth and creamy with a decent bit of carbonation and a semi dry finish that prickles on the back of the throat.
D-this is very simple and straight forward but still very tasty. the flavors blend together very well and it goes down so smooth. it has a great sourness to it with virtually no acidity. 880 characterscpetrone84, Mar 10, 2011

Pours a reddish brown with a finger of tannish head that fades, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass.
Aroma has some mild funk with notes of oak and cherries. Also some sour vinegar-like notes. Not quite as harsh as vinegar, but notably sour. 
Taste hits with some sour right off the bat before moving to the cherry sweetness in the middle and a dry sweet and sour finish that I can only describe as similar to a sweet tart... and there's nothing wrong with that.
It's medium in body with a mild carbonation, but it's a highly drinkable sour and it's a really top notch example of the style. Not really puckeringly sour, but sour enough and the cherries add an extra level of complexity. I'm definitely glad I've got a few more of these tucked away in the cellar. 840 characters321jeff, Mar 09, 2011

I enjoyed this beer with a special cigarette while watching The Expendables. It was a thoroughly enjoyable Sunday afternoon.
A: Slightly hazy ruby red color. Poured gently into a Duvel tulip, producing a one-finger cream colored head that recedes very slowly and left something beyond lacing. A film of foam was left on the sides of the glass as it emptied.
S: This beer smells of bacteria. It's very sour and vinous, but not vinegary, some sour cherry but mostly indistinct sourness. I can defenitely detect an oak barrel. I believe this is a Flanders Red. As it warms, the cherry becomes much more prominent.
T: First sip is mouth-puckeringly sour, there are cherries in this beer. Maybe this isn't a Flanders Red, as most of the fruity tartness seems to be from the Cherry. Anyway, I like it. It's also quite dry. Not much else until it gets to about 60º. Now I can taste the oak, and it's much more vinous, like a very dry wine. 
M: Velvety. Minimal carbonation, and that's how it should be. Very dry, maybe a little too dry.
D: Excellent sipper.

aromas of sour funk come off. some oak and a wine like association smells. i can already tell that its going to be sour. small hints of rasberries and cherries. 
starts off with an explosion of bubbles that help spread the funky goodness. not very over powering in the sour as the hints of oak begin to take the place of the cherry flavor. lingering oak and tart finish. well balance for a sour. very interesting. not sure i'm convince of being a sour fan yet but i wouldnt mind drinking this one again. 600 charactersemagana, Mar 05, 2011

The aroma is undoubtedly floral cherry with a subtle lemony air. If you enjoy sours this is pretty nice. The flavor initially says sour sour sour! Yikes. It has a definitive Alka-Seltzer quality with cherries on steroids. It's a bit lemony with granny apple cherry tart bite. Quite a lip twister with a hyperactive carbonation that keeps a lively feel in a mid-light bodied fizzy brew. It's pretty drinkable if you go for this sour stuffn and I do. Nice. 542 charactersDurge, Feb 26, 2011

Pours murky brown / hazy amber with a minor, then dissipating head leaving very thin lacing throughout the session. Nose is big and soft, lots of vinous type notes. Cherries are still vibrant in this one. Funky, oaty, lactic acid, oak, vinegar, tart cherries, wild yeast, and sour nose. On taste, this is how to do a cherry sour. Softened acidity. The oak comes across to prop up the cherry notes. Medium body with some graininess and some sharp, but soft carbonation. The finish is very tart and dry. This is a great sour beer for sour beer lovers. Top 50 material for me? Not for me, but wow what a beer! Respect. 668 charactersCuriousMonk, Feb 26, 2011

Smells of typical wild critters along with some indistinguishable fruit notes. Taste is very sour and sweet at the same time. The flavor sits on the tongue for a bit and livens up the mouth. Has some wine-like qualities to it, but not really like a pinot. The mouthfeel is intense as it constantly has that tingling going on. Drinkability is good for a sour. I wouldn't drink these all day long, but very nice. My favorite RR sour of those I've tried (temptation, consecration). 598 charactersBlanco, Feb 24, 2011

Appearance - Orange/ruby red with a bit of haziness. Minimal carbonation, vigorous poor yields half finger head of loose bubbles that recede quickly.
Smell - Apples, cherries, grapes (all of them tart). Vinegar, sweet red fruits. Hint of oak/woodiness. Smells like a sour.
Taste - Bam. Intense tartness/sourness and acidity upfront followed by sweet fruity flavors. Ends with more tartness. Super complex with some oakiness, maybe some hints of the pinot barrels? Probably a bit too cold right now but as its warming theres more depth to the taste.
Mouthfeel - Great carbonation with a lingering bitterness. Really nice aftertaste.
Drinkability - Well it cost a pretty penny to get out here. I think the depth/cost/sourness would prevent me from drinking more than one. Definitely intend on savoring this one. Really impressed with my first taste of Russian River. 1,060 charactersbballmj2k, Feb 23, 2011

Pours a hazy brown with a slightly red hue to it. Starts with about a finger of fizzy head that dissipates quickly. At first I kind of just thought this smelled medicinal. I was put of at first and thought I was getting set up for a big disapointment. Once I got into it a little bit sweet cherries reveal themselves as an overtone to the aroma with a nice balance of oak and bret funk. It finishes with a slightly tart vinegar aroma to it. World class flavor on this. Cherries right up front; being slightly tart and a bit of sweetness to finish it out. Woody oak notes surround the pallet here. The feel is kind of dry with lively carbonation. Really nothing to shake a stick at here. Overall, Russian River seems to make some of the most drinkable American sours on the market. File this under perma-want. 900 charactersBendurgin, Feb 22, 2011

375ml bottle poured into a snifter. This particular gem pours an earth brown and rich mahogany with bright dark cherry red highlights. A large, three to four finger head rises from the pour, bone white it color. The head dissipates quickly and does not leave any lacing on the glass. A nice ring of lace is however left around the circumference of the surface of the beer. 
The brett and lacto have taken over this beer for the most part. What was once a brown ale is no more in the olfactory department. Ripe cherries and brett on the nose. Strong fruit characterists, a nice sourness are triumphant. The aging is pinot noir barrels is evident with the heavy wood profile I am picking up on. 
The brown ale base is evident in the creamy, bready maltiness that crosses my taste buds, mingled with the tart sour cherries. Brilliant. Some time in the cellar has done this batch well. The added cherries, or maybe some other factor, make my taste buds succumb to a pleasant sweetness. A nice funky aspect has taken a firm grip on this batch. 
Mildly acidic with a prickly carbonation is absolutely perfect, this beer is insanely drinkable. The alcohol is unnoticeable to the palate. It drinks very similar to a good pinot noir as the wine characteristics truly shine in this beer. 1,366 charactersmjn5036, Feb 17, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - Cork didn't shoot out all by itself and foam over like some RR beers have done to me in the past. Pours a murky/unfiltered dark brown with a huge light-foamy head that fades rather quickly leaving little lace on the glass. Bottle has yeast dregs left in the bottom.
S - Lots of funk on this one, in a good way of course. The wine barrel/woody flavor is definitely present and the cherries are a little more difficult to pick up over all the yeast aromas.
T - Very tart and dry from the barrel aging and from all the fun bacteria used to make this brew. Wine-like tannins can be detected and the cherries do come out a little more when drinking and they are mostly sour as well. Great dry oak flavors at the finish as well as all the yeast-produced flavors. Great complexity but not too much as to confuse the palate.
M/D - Medium body with a high amount of carbonation (as should be for this sytle) which leaves a very dry mouthfeel. All the flavors of wood, fruit, and bacteria aging blend very well and make it super easy to drink.
Another knock-out punch from Russian River. 1,085 charactersVaTechHopHead, Feb 13, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Cool little corked and caged bottle with Russian River's trademark crappy label art, luckily their beer is some of the best in the world.
Pours up a pristine, clear ruby brown with two fingers of light, airy foam that doesn't collapse as expected, but instead hangs around for the duration.
Russian River's classic sour/wild profile is in full force. Aggressive acid, mildly funky and fruity Brett, with a complementary and complexity-adding note of acetic acid. Some notes of caramel and toffee just barely peek out from behind the wild notes and ultra-dry finish, while musky oak and a little brightness from the cherries rounds it out and softens the edges a bit.
The best American Wild Ale I've sampled to date. Funky, complex, sour, but altogether well-balanced and superbly drinkable. 793 charactersbump8628, Feb 13, 2011
4.13/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a brownish orange with a small head that does stay around.
Smell is very overpowering strong sour cherries. There is a bit of citrus sour in there also.
Taste is also very sour. For me the sour flavor was overpowering most everything else.
Mouth was surprisingly thick with a good carbonation.
WOW. This beer was without a doubt like nothing I had ever had before... hard to tell at times if that was a good thing or a bad thing. I am leaning toward good but really struggled to finish with the overpowering flavors eventually getting to me. Quite a bit too much sour for me to enjoy finishing the entire bottle let alone having another. 647 charactersmryuk, Feb 13, 2011

Pours a hazy deep amber color with a nice off-white head.
nice tart scent up front with hints of cherries and oak, light funk
Taste is pretty close to the nose with a nice blend of sour notes along with cherries funk and oak
The body is a little bit fuller than other sours I had at the tasting

A: A murky brownish cherry red with a small white head that fades at a decent pace. Decent.
S: A sugary lemon scent upfront quickly followed by a hint of cherry. Kind of like a medical cherry medicine mixed with an energy drink. Good.
T: A tart lemon upfront, but not too harsh. It's a sour, but not overly sour. Hints of cherry in the middle with some sugary malts on very hidden on the backend. Good.
M: Medium body with a huge carbonation. A very tart finish. Good.
D: Once you get past the sourness, it goes down decent. 
All in all, this is a very sour brew. Not really my style. It's a good beer, but not my style. Sours have never really made it up my alley. Good to try if you like tart brews 788 characterssteve8robin, Feb 12, 2011

Pours a hazy, murky deep amber color with a nice off-white head. 
Smells of sour, barnyard funkiness are first noticed. Sour cherries play nicely with beautiful oak nuances. 
Taste follows the nose with a complex melding of sour cherries, oak, and funk. Needs to be experienced to understand. Strangely delicious. 
Medium body with light, creamy carbonation to massage the tounge.
My first foray into the world of sours was extremely successful. A very unique beer everyone should try at least once. I highly recommend this expertly-crafted brew. 646 charactersbwiechmann, Feb 10, 2011

bottle to tulip
375 C/C Batch 005X4
App- A much darker beer than I would have thought. Amber with orange highlights. One finger head that didn't last long.
Smell- A nice smelling beer with the grape skin tannins, Cherry, funk and yeast at time eminating upward on big sniffs.
Taste- On my 1st sip of a RR sour I get a feeling of being sucked into a cult. These are very good and I see why people love them. It's different from Cantillon and Drie because of the flavors. Not as tart, or off putting. A nice sweet flavor with the tartness you are looking for.
Mouth- Medium bodied with a high carbonation. Very bubbly on the mouth with a champagne feel except with a yeasty cherry funky taste. Quite good.
Drink- Outstanding by itself but with the right dessert for me could be magical. The cherries and the bubbles are like a nice white wine. Vinnies background is very evident in the sours he does. 922 charactersFosterJM, Feb 10, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: This poured a cloudy dark gold, with a little white head.
S: It smelled like sour and dry white grapes and green apples. Very champagne-like, with mostly tart and funky fruits, along with some sour wild yeast and grassy hops.
T: It tasted like very puckering sour and tart green apple and white grape, with some oak and vinegar and tons of wild yeast. It had a super tart and sour aftertaste that lasted quite a while.
M: It was thin with lots of bubbly carbonation, reinforcing the similarity to champagne.
D: This was a great wild ale, with super sour and tart scent and taste. It had a light and fizzy body, which I normally don't like, but it worked well for the style. Alcohol wasn't noticeable either, so this was really not that difficult to drink. But like most wild ales, this beer is really meant to be sipped. Not sure how age might help this one, but I thoroughly enjoyed it fresh. 896 charactersPencible, Feb 09, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5batch 005X2
A - pours a deep reddish brown with only half a finger of persistant head (though I poured it a bit slowly to keep yeast sediment in the bottle).
S - Cherries are initially prevalent, giving way to hints of oak, a bit of funk and sour apple. This smells fantastic.
T - Very tart, acidic cherry and oak tannins come through and dry the palate; some sour apple and mustiness as well. A wonderful blend of flavors. I'm really enjoying this.
M - Medium mouthfeel with great carbonation. This is lively, tart and drying on the palate.
D - Definitely one to sip slowly and enjoy. Makes me want to travel to California more often. 640 characterswarnerry, Feb 08, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Body is clear brown, resembling dark apple cider. Poured easily to a half inch of tan head, which quickly dissipated to a collar, producing some trace elements of lacing as it is consumed. 
Complex nose of sour apples, oak wood, vanilla, citrus, cinnamon spice, cherries and pinot noir.
This tastes somewhat tart, mainly of sour apples with a little cinnamon spiciness. Cherries and pinot noir add deeper body. The acidity is balanced by woody vanilla notes. It is dry in the finish, through which the pinot flavor extends all the way. 
Body is light and carbonation is fizzy, giving this a refreshing, crisp mouthfeel. 
This is a very tasty beer. It builds on the Belgian bruin style, with a foundation of bacteria-produced sourness and cherries. But aging in pinot noir barrels gives this its lovely spicy varietal element that is unique and delicious (OK, I like pinot). 877 charactersBeerenauslese, Feb 07, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to AFKsports for this bottle at splinter black...finally got around to drinking it.
Pours deep amber with a half inch of off white head. Leaves almost no lacing down the glass.
Smells like barnyard, slight citrus acidity, oak, wheat and cherry sweetness.
Taste is acidic, sour, oak, cherry, lemon, barn-ish flavor. Think like a tamer version of Cantillon kriek. The wine flavors make an appearance out of my Infinium glass, not as much out of the ommegang glass.
Mouthfeel is very carbonated with a moderate mouthfeel. Carbonation cleans palate.
Drinkability is amazing. Not sour enough to deter, carbonation cleanses the palate.
Closest to a perfect beer as I've ever had. As enjoyable as Temptation for me. 726 charactersbs870621345, Feb 07, 2011

Poured in my Struise glass the beer looks OK, nothing fancy. The fluid is brown like tea and the head sizzles in the glass when i poured the beer with some light carbonation.
Smell is not spectacular but the taste is very good for this style. Oak smell and the sour taste make this beer quit good. Cherries far away. This is not my style as you may have noticed but not bad. 460 charactersBrabander, Feb 06, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got this one courtesy of my sister in Seattle, a late Christmas present. Thanks sis!
Poured into my Dfh snifter, pours a dark orange and semi-cloudy color. Smell- big cherry tart, yeastiness, banana. Taste- tart cherries, a little brett funk, a hint of banana, some yeast goodness, and a finishing touch of clove. Also, some definite red wine grape flavors. Very complex but very smooth. Mouthfeel: high levels of carbonation give a refreshing feel to this wonderful and artisanally crafted masterpiece. Drinkability: if I didn't want to savor this because it is my one and only bottle, I could gladly and quickly drink 6 more consecutively.
Overall, wonderful experience from RR. This one lives up to the hype. 713 characterslnashsig, Feb 05, 2011
3.65/5  rDev -18.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5375 ml bottle from Tim. Batch 005- that's 2/09 according to the website.
Appearance: There's a bit of rocky head that fades pretty quickly to a thin sheet. A few spots of lacing. The beer itself is a very clear, bright red. Good looking beer.
Smell: Sour cherry, medicinal phenols, oak, and tannic red wine. Musty cellar funk. 
Taste: Pretty sour real cherry flavors. It doesn't have medicinal phenols in the flavor like I smelled. Malt flavor hides in the background and is overpowered by the tannic red wine and oak. The wine fades a bit in the long finish and a little sweet fruit and malt comes through with a little funk.
Mouthfeel: Pretty good carbonation, the body of the beer is on the lighter side, but the tannins leave a sticky, furry feeling on the tongue.
Drinkability: I love the sour, fruity, and funky notes, but the red wine and tannins are a little out of control. It limits the overall enjoyment. Beer should taste like beer, this one tastes too much like wine. 985 charactersrapidsequence, Feb 05, 2011

Batch 4 
Pours a reddish with thin white head.  Smells like oak, cherries with some sourness. Tastes like sour cherries, slightly tart, sour finish. You can taste the wood in there as well, very good beer.

A- Clear amber/rosy color. Some sediment in the second pour. Lots of active carbonation. Poured with 1/4" light peachy off-white head that settles to a lingering thin coating. Some light lacing.
S- Funky brett and fruity/cherry sweetness.
T- Funky brett and definitely some lacto as well upfront, extremely tart fruitiness with some cherry notes. Some faint oak at times. A bit of lemony citrus undertones as well. Incredibly smooth, tart, and extremely awesome.
M- Light bodied with tons of fine carbonation. Smooth and dry.
D- Thankfully I don't come across this often so I can honestly write that I will drink it every opportunity I get. Really excellent. The funky brett flavor just shines in this brew. Smooth and tart. Complex and well balanced all around. 810 charactersmisinformed, Feb 02, 2011

S: very tart with cherry aroma
T: The taste of this beer is phenomenal. To try and describe this beers taste would be a welcomed sour tart cherry flavor with a brett backbone.
M: The mouthfeel is very bubbly with natural carbonation. I love this type of carbonation because of the finest the carbonation takes on.
D: I could drink this beer all day. I really enjoyed this beer but the main issue is the price. I know that price is not part of drinkability so I did not mark down my rating in this category, but it is an extremely expensive beer and due to that fact I feel it is a great beer to try here and there but not something I would really go after again. 711 characterswrightro07, Jan 31, 2011

Pours a lovely ruby red color with a very light, filmy head. Mild sweet & sour aroma; nice hints or orange. Very flavorful taste of orange, cherry, and lime. The finish is very sweet & sour, with a similar yet mild aftertaste. Surprisingly, there's very little bitterness here. Light- to medium-bodied, with mild carbonation.

Thanks to jethrodium for this want.
This is batch 04X1. This beer pours a nice copper amber color with a frothy white foam that degrades to a thin layer but stays that thin layer throughout the consuming of this beer. This beer has the funk that is so sought after in many of the sours that I know. There is a citrus sour that comes from all sorts of bacteria. There is some cherry notes on the nose as well with some pretty decent oak notes. The taste is sour, oh so sour. The tartness of the intentional infection is not something that I know if I'm ever gonna get used to, I've really probably got to work my way up to appreciating these beers. The tart mouthfeel goes down pretty easy, it's got good carbonation for the style, and it's pretty easy to drink if I do say so. Again, it's not my style, but then again I never respected hop bombs, so maybe the time will come for me to revisit this beer. 939 charactersVdubb86, Jan 26, 2011

You can smell the sourness. There's some cherry and other fruits. Some citrus and light floral notes with some sugar tossed in.
The taste is sour cherry with a nice citrus blend giving some base. You can taste the wine influence. Kind of has a sugared grapefruit taste to the middle of the taste.
Not so much of a tart front that I was expecting. It was a nice blend of flavor and sourness.
Another great sour ale from RR. It's got a lot of great flavor and a refreshing quality to it. Definitely want more. 612 characterscjacobsen, Jan 25, 2011

4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I received this in a trade some time ago, can't remember who it was with, but I'm really glad whoever it was made this deal go down. Review is from notes taken on 1/21/2011 and poured from the bottle to a goblet, batch 04X1.
Appearance: Pour is a rich orange and coppery color with a bit of a reddish tone in the highlights; starts with a short, 1/4 finger off-white fizzy head that fades very quickly to a thin, uneven and incomplete skim on the surface; body is just a touch hazy/cloudy, but still shows ample carbonation bubbling up and throughout; only a few strands of lacing are left on the front, but the back of the glass is a thin, but complete wall of sticky lacing.
Smell: Very nice -- lots of very tart cherries, some oak notes and a bit of that sweet vanilla presence that often accompanies the oak -- the sweetness creates just a touch of a medicinal quality to it; a bit of a brett funkiness, but it seems to be hiding behind the cherries; the tartness in the scent makes my mouth water and I can tell it's going to make me pucker.
Taste: Wow, this may be the tartest ale I've ever tasted -- the sour cherries are strong and right up front, but they taste amazingly fresh considering how long this sits in the barrel and has been sitting on a shelf in my beer closet, it's as if I literally bit through the skin of a fresh picked cherry; bit of a slight vinegar presence and touch of the brett funkiness that is present in the nose; there is a touch of oakiness in it and it brings about an attempt at some sweetness to provide a touch of balance, but the sour/tart/funkiness really leads the way in this beer, just as it should; the flavors that the cherries and barrel-aging in the pinot barrels are extremely prevalent.
Mouthfeel: The body is just a tad heavier than what I would consider light; the carbonation is present and lively, but doesn't come across as harsh or anything; the tartness is amazing, especially on the first sip and it makes my mouth pucker and water in an uncontrollable fashion; a thick, moist stickiness is left all over the mouth and continues to linger long after each sip; belly is left warm from the acidic nature of the beer; really awesome effects coming from this one and it really helps make for more of a total experience as opposed to just drinking a beer (not that there's anything wrong with that either).
Drinkability: Really an amazing beer and on part with the other great beers I've been fortunate enough to sample from Russian River; nice smells, amazing flavors and a roller coaster of a mouthfeel certainly give it a lot of credence, however, the strong nature of the acidity and extreme tartness is not something that I feel I would crave on a regular basis, but when the mood strikes, this is a world class offering. 2,785 charactersbamadog, Jan 22, 2011

Taste, astringent, tart, puckering cherry flavor. Again, oak. Tons of brett flavor, lots of tannin grittiness coats the tongue and mouth.
A very chill sweetness to it, along with a gritty earthiness. One of the best wild ales out there, only rivaled in its style by Bruery's oude tart w/ sour cherries. 446 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jan 21, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured into a Duvel tulip.
Appearance: Cloudy, ruby red liquid. Slightly larger than one-finger, white head; dissolves down to thick lace quickly and clings to the glass as the beer level drops. Fair amount of vigorous carbonation as well.
Smell: Mixture of apple, cherry, and grape aromas. Very strong; flows out of the glass and into my nose from three feet away. 
Taste: Wow! This is probably the fullest bodied beer I have drank to date. Tangy cider taste to start, evolving into a bold cherry on the tongue, and back to sharp apple aftershocks. Wish I had enough bottles on hand to do a Temptation/Supplication comparison. Going off memory, this one probably wins. 
Mouthfeel: Every drink washes the palate clean. There is just ever so slight a hint of the sour taste left over, but mainly there is a clean slate waiting for the next sip. Sadly there are not enough.
Drinkability: If I lived somewhere that this was readily available I would line my cellar with it. A great brew. The only thing that hindered its drinkability was knowing that once I drank it all I had no more. Gives a whole new meaning to crying in your beer. 1,137 characterstburus, Jan 20, 2011

A - Pours a strong gorgeous amber color with some nice copper hints. A nice off white light cream head is present with some nice dense bubbles interlaced with some medium sized ones. There is about 1 inch of head and retains pretty good. 
S - Some corn husk and hay come in fast with the nice cherry tartness. Nice and very slight fruit aroma is mixed in with the tartness. Some good funky yeast in the nose that is perfectly balanced with the sour notes. Delicious woody oak hints finish this beer of with a clean nose. 
T & M - Tart cherry notes puckers the mouth quickly. The sour notes are more toward the fruiter side at the beginning but then finish off a bit on the vinegar side, good balance. Some nice tart grape and obviously cherry. Wood dryness coats the palette. The funk is present but less so on the taste. Feel is nice and light and clean. Delicious brew with good carbonation and a prickly feel. Some slight alcohol is noticed but not too much.
D - Delicious beer by RR. I really enjoyed this sour and have been slowly getting into them; with this one being the best yet. 1,149 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jan 20, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Came to the table with a slightly hazed orange red with no discernable solids in the body, but it was not clear. The head on the pour was nice and solid and lowered to a skim after a minute or so. 
The smell is quite incredible. It starts with more of a slightly sour smell with some cherry pits, but as it warms it takes on a more winey character with a definite cedar smell. I really enjoyed the smell of this beer, cherry pits, cedar, brown sugar, red wine, and a damp sweet earthiness. Truly amazing. 
Taste was quite good as well, but not as complex as the nose. It had a light sour character that interplayed with some sweetness and a dry woodiness. 
Mouthfeel was spot on - moderately thick, creamy carbonation and a slight drying. 741 characterstobin, Jan 17, 2011

L: Hazy orangish red, nice tight off-white head with lots of bubbles. Decent retention for a sour. Burnt orange bordering on brown.
T: Bready dark malt followed quickly by cherry tartness. Fairly strong acidity cleans the palate leaving some tingling on the tongue. As it warms, more cherry tartness is left on the palate with just a touch of sweetness. Some winey tannins in the finish drying the palate.
M: Medium-bodied, medium-high carbonation, some warming alcohol.
Fantastic sour, not sure if i liked it as much as Temptation. But very well balanced with great bold flavors. Loved it. 756 charactersbum732, Jan 17, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served this in a Great Divide balloon glass poured from a bottle. I gave 1/3 to myself, 1/3 to a roommate and 1/3 (the dregs) to a fermented of my own wild. Batch 005x3.
This beer is wonderfully clear. Its color is brown with clear orange notes. However, it's not breathtaking or remarkable in any way other than its clarity. The head is thin and white, but it does leave some nice lacing on a glass at was too recently washed with soap.
The nose is sour, tart and inviting. Definitely a sour, fruity and funky beer. The fruit is mostly cherries in my opinion. There's great complex layering here. Not the best smelling beer I've ever had, but it's definitely up there.
The taste is dry, fruity, sour and funky. It starts with a lactic acidity, moves to a dry cherry and ends with a barnyard, footy funk. I love beers that are layered like this. The beer is wonderfully carbonated, which makes it bright on my tongue.
I've gone out of my way to bring this back to Texas with me a few times and I'm homebrewing a batch to duplicate its wild nd sour character. Can there be any higher praise? This is unquestionably a world class beer. 1,137 charactersUTCengOwl, Jan 15, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 375ml bottle into a chalice. Batch 5. Bottled May 2010. Drank 01/13/2011. 
Poured a slightly hazy cherry wood color. Fizzy rusty head that dissipated fairly quickly, but left some lacing around the top of the glass. Smell was tart and with the slightest hint of earthy leather.
Dancing carbonation makes this a very light bodied beer. Fruity, sour cherry at first followed by a very slight brett character. Red wine. Leather, wood. Very dry. Mouth puckeringly dry. But in a good way. 
Lengthy sour finish. Delicious. This beer would be great with a cheese plate and some dark fruits. Each sip is seemingly palate cleansing. Did I say delicious? 661 charactersnniicckkww, Jan 14, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared with cmurren25, Jwiss22, JayW73 and Lane23 at a little tasting, finally a proper review of one of my all time favorites and the experience was just like always...
A- A nice dark brown color with a slight ruby/mahogany hue. A nice steady stream of bubbles showing off the nice carb and leading up to a fluffy and thin white head with a little pinkish tinge.
S- Uh Oh! Here we go again the beer that always gets me in trouble. I can never get bored of that aroma. It's an immediate rush of sour and tart cherries with some amazing musty and lactic undertones. I love this smell. It's a crazy and complex aroma that I wish they made into deodorant. As it warms which is hard for me to let happen it allows the sublte oak undertones to breathe and let the vanilla and faint, but sharp mustiness to come out. Really an incredible aroma!
T- BLISS! A rush or sour cherries has led me to nirvana. It is life altering good. The cherries are the focal point in the beginning, but the awesome lactic sourness and the sublte brett mustiness work well together side by side with the sour cherries. I detect and almost sharp cheese characteristic that is awesome as it warms then I realize that it's all the barrel. The bugs are going crazy. A crazy mix of earthy wood, sweet oak and subtle vanilla that make the finish simply divine. Again BLISS!
M- It's a sour obviously, but it's crazily balanced. A great mustiness, awesome slightly syrupy coating and an in your face, puckering sour that leaves you craving more. The carb tingles, prickles and makes sure that it coats every inch of your mouth so you can taste every single nuance of this masterpiece. 
D- You bet your ass! I can't believe how refreshing, fulfilling and satisfying this one is. I love the complex aromas and tastes. The ridiculous balance leaves you wanting more and more and more. It continues to impress every time I crack a new bottle. A MASTERPIECE!
MORE! MORE! MORE!...PLEASE!!! 1,962 charactersStormKing47, Jan 12, 2011

Smell is pronounced sour cherry, not much else. Taste is just the right amount of sour, without any yeasty funkiness.

A: Pour a nice and bold red/brown, not as much red from cherries as I would have guessed. Head is fluffy and holds very well, lacing is as sticky as the head is. 
S: An aroma that can only come from a well produced sour. A tight and sharp snap from the Bret, underlining a use of cherry and very dry use of hop.
T/M: The bold and complex flavors in this beer are beyond the norm, this is a highly great use of sour, that shows a nice blend of brown sour character and a interplay of a Belgian Kriek. SOUR, SOUR and more sour, this is spot on for the American style and sets standards for what the Wild ale should be compared to. 
D: Mind blowing, had this while brewing a Pliny clone with my father, wow thanks Russian River, great brews and pushing the style envelope. I could find my self drinking many of these sours. 904 charactersGDBEERMAN, Jan 05, 2011

Poured from Bottle into Bells Tulip.
A - Dark orange color with a good amount of cream colored head. Dissipates quickly, leaving a thick foam cap. Lots of lacing...
S - Tart Cherries, some sugars and a bit of funk. Wood is also present, but very subtle. 
T - I love this stuff. Sweet cherries go well with the tartness and lacto. Bready Malts were surprising the first few times, but it's an awesome compliment. Sour finish and a bite of carbonation goes to MF.
M - Very dry with that carbonation bite. Leave you with that sweet tart taste.
D - I drink it all the time, and just wish it was more readily available. 12 bucks a bottle on the east coast is also holding this back, but I still buy it. 823 charactersBeerThursdays, Jan 05, 2011

The color is a medium colored amber with a typical fizzy head. Aroma is fantastic, citrus, malt, almost fruity. Flavor is also very good, quite sour with a citrus flavor, some sense of the brown ale as well. Overall one of the best sour ales out there. 428 charactersdavid18, Jan 03, 2011

A: Gentle pour yields 1/4 finger of fizzy tan head with poor retention - I'd like more and better retention. Is that possible with sour beers? Clear light brown liquid with some red and amber highlights. Color is great, which brings my rating up from a 3.5 to a 4.0.
S: Citrus, lemon zest. Slight aspirin? Slight bread. So intriguing and inviting.
T: Delicious! Perfect tasting sour brown (which I thought it was!), sourness and sweetness mix perfectly, like lemonade almost. Slight whole wheat breadiness in the aftertaste. Some Atomic Warhead candy in aftertaste too. Apple cider, woody, grapeskin.
M: Expectorant, tart, dry
D: So nice. I'd definitely order another and will buy again when I can! 734 charactersdfillius, Jan 01, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this as a send-off to 2010 and had only had small GABF samples prior.
Pours a brownish red that's surprisingly pretty clear throughout. Head is heavy initially, but fades into a sheen that laces as well as you could hope.
The primary flavor profiles overlap and ebb/flow between citrus, sour cherries, lemon rind, dry red wine, and spicy notes from the yeast. Occasionally I'd pick up malt notes that remind me of the balsamic-like Belgian browns, too. There's so much going on, but it never seems like any one flavor dominates and everything seems to work in harmony.
I split one of the newer 375's of this and truly wish I had more. Even at a pretty steep price, this stuff is worth every penny. 
Definitely something I plan on seeking out in the future, I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for this on tap, too. 815 charactersDomingo, Jan 01, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 4, bottling 5 poured into my snifter.
A - cloudy brown with a finger white head which stays for the whole our. Lacing is fairly heavy and slowly cascades down the side of the glass. 
S - Intense aroma - loads of lemon, vinegar, grass, and some phenoly alcohol.
T - Intensely tart lemon and mouth puckering vinegar and funky farmhouse/grass. This isn't the most sour wild/geuze I've ever had, but it certainly does the trick. You can definitely detect where the "brown" from the sour brown ale came from - though the malt profile is absolutely swallowed by the tart and funk, there is a little bit of residual caramel and nut flavor when you search for it. The finish is astringent, mouth drying lemony vinegar with a grassy quality. Imo, not as mouth puckering and dry as a consecration, but ten fold the sour as say, a temptation. 
M - medium body with mediumish carbonation. The vinegar and lemon qualities are lingering for quite a long time. This isn't necessarily a negative, but the finish is intense. 
D - This is a Tums required beer; so vinegary, so acidic that you'll eventually need some relief after a 375. As much as I love the flavor, this gets somewhat offensive when you near the dregs. After nearly a whole 375ml, I feel like I've stripped a coat of skin off my tongue and mouth. 1,307 charactersdrewba, Jan 01, 2011
3.38/5  rDev -24.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5A great sour to help ring in the new year.
A: Fairly opaque, very dark burnt orange. Quickly dissipating, small bubbled white head. 
S: Smells very strongly of lacto-sour. That smell is so distinctive and overpowering that it's 
T: Distinctly sour, hard to pick out any outstanding hops or malts, but it's notable for it's lack of a harshness at the end of the taste. The tart cherry flavor is pretty up front in the flavor profile.
M: Med-light body.
D: Fairly drinkable, very good for a sour though. 506 charactersMatthewPatthew, Jan 01, 2011

A: Light gold with red highlights, lots of thin bubbles clinging to the class. Really beautiful.
S: Tart cherry, strawberry, rich wine-y notes. There's something slightly sweet in the smell.
T: Tartness with slight strawberry flavor upfront, followed by a distinct funk, and bitterness across my whole tongue. The aftertaste is winey, and I love the sweet and aromatic wood flavor at the end. Tartness lingers on the back of the tongue for 30+ seconds, but is never pucker-worthy. End tastes of fresh cut grass, young wood, and maybe fresh pea or something like that. Incredibly refreshing.
M: Really tiny prickly bubbles. 
D: This is the first sour that I've been determined to purchase again. Amazing. 795 charactersthebreederswow, Jan 01, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A Classic solid sour from RR.
A: Pours a dark amber with lots of bubbles and a head that dies down quickly, not a lot of lacing either, but i wasn't expecting much. 
S: Smell is very funky, but not overly sour like some wilds tend to be. Tart cherry is the star with touches of vanilla oak, yeast, and a sugar coating rounds it out, nice stuff. 
T: Awesome flavor that showcases great balance while still having an awesome tartness. Barnyard funk, tart cherry, oak vanilla, very savory sweet end at the back of the palate with some fruit rind bitterness to boot. Sour twist of lemon and lime under the cherry. Some malt to balance as well. Awesome.
M: Nice carbonation yet smooth and leaves the tongue electric with flavor. 
D: High for a sour in my opinion. While most sours are good for 4oz and then you're done, this one you can have a good bit more and not get tired of it. Great balance, tasty! 904 charactersDreadnaught33, Dec 30, 2010

Pours a golden orange colour with about a finger of white head. Nice head retention and amazing layer of lace down the side of the glass. Smells of sour cherries and apples, with some vinegar and oak as well. Flavour is quite sour. I let my friends try this beer, which then set them off on a quest to keep drinking sour beers whenever possible for the rest of the trip. 549 characterskwjd, Dec 29, 2010

 Poured a light tan/Orange glow with a light off white head forming pretty well. The head stuck around for a bit and left some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma of this brew gave my Wife and I a clue that this was going to pucker us up. The smell consisted of Sour Fruits Cherry's and apples up and to the front. Though in the background seemed to be a herbal undertone that gave these sour smells more power.
The first sip blew both of us away as we quickly fell in love with it. My Wife who from this beer alone has joined the ranks of craft beer enthusiast, is now drinking wild ale, saisions, lambics, and Barleywines. The flavor was very sour but not to the point where it left no flavor, quit the opposite. The flavors plowed threw our taste buds with the carbonation at a perfect level to achieve this move. After my second sip I removed my self to use the washroom and came back to an empty bottle. The Wife had no look of guilt but of satisfaction. Which she now pays for with the shipping of these types of beers as it is little to find in my area. 1,097 charactersBZero007, Dec 27, 2010

A: A cloudy slightly orange brown with about half an inch of off white head. The head stays around in a thin layer (at least it has so far) and leaves nice lacing behind. 
S: First smell and I get that nice mouth watering sour smell. Smells very tart and some cherries. Maybe hints of sour apple. 
T: Very sour but not quite pucker up forehead sweat sour. The sour fades and leaves a great cherry aftertaste. 
M: Pretty thin, very strong lactic presence makes me think my teeth are losing enamel with each sip. Perfect level of carbonation leaves adds to the great mouthfeel.

A little cloudy, orangey-brown, very little head, medium active carbonation. Smell is tart and pleasant, a little unripe orange or maybe grapefruit juice, cherry blossom.
Taste is very tart with a dry chalky twist (which is better than it sounds). Makes me think a little bit of the big white chalky chewable vitamin C pills that my parents used to have (and which I secretly loved). Tartness is strong enough for a big mouthful to twinge my jaws.
Mouthfeel is dry, light, not sticky at all. A little effervescent. I couldn't session any beer this tart, but it's a pleasant, tasty beer. 644 characterssnaotheus, Dec 24, 2010

A - Pours a clear ruby-ish copper with a half finger of off white head. Looks nice.
S - This is not a smell I know. Is this the legendary "Brett funk"? It is a bit sweet, a bit sour, and yeasty. Sour black cherries and perhaps some sour apple.
T - Extremely sour on the first sip, you get used to it as you drink. Definitely earns the title of Sour Ale. Sour apple and sour cherries. I am instantly reminded of the dry acidity of pinor noit. This is so so delicious.
M - Medium to light body with very active carbonation. A bit cloying finish.
D - Despite the sourness I find it very easy to drink. Tart and sweet and an absolute joy and privilege to drink. 739 charactersgreenmonstah, Dec 23, 2010
3.9/5  rDev -13.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured into a MJ tasting glass.
Pours a ruby hue with orange highlights around the edges of the glass. About a finger of head that drops rather quickly. But a very effervescent brew.
Aromas of lactic sourness, oakiness, cherry stones, vinegar, and cherries.
First sip is of a slightly puckering sourness. A bit of a carbonic bite. Sour cherry juice, untoasted oak. Vinegar and lactic sourness. And cherry pits.
Mouthfeel is thin, tart, and a drying puckerness.
Drinkability is fairly good. A "classic" american wild brew. Missing some intangibles from a belgian sour, lack of "earthiness." Overall good, but nothing to get too excited about. Not getting the hype. 668 charactersJamnesCameron, Dec 22, 2010

A: A darker golden orange color with a prickly two finger white head. No glass lacing to speak of.
S: Wow, sour and tartness jump with smells of fruit, cherry, apple and some yeastiness.
T: Sour? Absolutely, just plain mouth puckering from the second it hits your lips. Flavors of dark fruit, cherry, some apple, pear with some very slight (I do mean slight) sweetness. Some yeastiness but no funk. Finish remains sour and puckering that just lasts seemingly forever. So this has brett in it? I'm not getting any classic brett flavors.
M: Tart, puckering, full, coating.
D: Medium, it was the perfect serving size but more might not have been better.
Overall this is one sour beer (like I expected anything less), but a great beer at that. RR is amazing with their sours as they are just so damn good. I might like Consecration better, but this is one great beer too. 929 charactersKadonny, Dec 20, 2010

S - I can safely say I have never smelled that aroma before in my life (this is the first sour I have ever had). I will assume the brett is what I smell. Sweet smelling but I can't place any aroma at all...
T - Wow. Wow. Sour. Lots of sour apples. Dark cherry flavor as well. Complex, but once again I can't place any of the flavors as I have never had anything like it before. 
M - Medium body, lots of carbonation. Sour all the way through with a nice crisp finish. 
D - Extremely drinkable. ABV doesnt show at all, this might as well not have any alcohol as far as I'm concerned. The sourness isn't too overpowering either. I had never had a sour, so I expected this to force my to pucker up the entire taste, not the case.

A: Ports a reddish amber with little clarity. The head is a think white layer that has nice lacing and somehow stays with throughout the tasting.

T: The sour cherries and overall tart is great. The sourness hits the front of my pallet aggressively but fades away allowing for more of the subtle notes to shine.
The brett/lacto/pedio and apparent but man does this finish so clean. If it were easy I suspect all American Wilds would taste this good.

4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoying this the evening before my first brewery only release at Troegs for Splinter Black. From a batch 5 bottle. Shared with the woman, who gives the dreaded beerface to it (a day after giving La Folie two thumbs up!).
Supplication is a wildy tasty sour. Great lacing, half finger of head that dissipates but spots the glass and retains well. The aroma is strong of cherries and puckering tartness. Taste follows the nose and is dark cherries that pucker but aren't overwhelmed by malts. The malts are present too, just dominated by the sourness.
For all the sour, it's still highly drinkable. After the medium body, nicely carbonated brew goes through it leaves you puckering for more. At 7.00%, that's not hard. Only problem is the price. 745 charactersafksports, Dec 15, 2010

3/4 finger brown head, quick dissipation resulting in thin broken layer on top of clear reddish brown body, small trail of very small bubbles rising from bottom of glass. Nose is a bit fruity, some oakiness, horse blanket funk, not picking up a lot of hop aromatics. Taste features a bit of cherry sweetness upfront, a bit more tart than sour, funky backend, musty, some floral hops but not much bitterness, not mouth puckering sour. Mouthfeel just on the light side of medium, pretty sticky. Drinkability is good for style but dont' want to do multiple glasses re palate fatigue. Complex and certainly recommended for fans of the style. 721 charactersjdense, Dec 12, 2010

Pours ruddy copper with a thin white collar
Tart cherry, vinegar, and heavy oak on the nose
Much livelier in taste than smell. Tart cherries at the get go muted by funk and vinegar across the middle. Highly acidic and hugely tannic on the back. Barrel is all over this beer. Perhaps memory is faulty, but I've had this beer a handful of times including on tap at the brewery and this just doesn't seem the same: less sour and more vinegar and oak. 
Another conundrum lies in the mouthfeel. A lively pop from the cork portended a high level of carbonation. Once poured and allowed to settle, the promise isn't quite kept. Oddly it seems just a bit off.
Not to blaspheme, and I'm sure this isn't a bad bottle, but this just didn't deliver on the promise of what I know to be a good beer. A mild disappointment. 920 charactersBarrytheBear, Dec 12, 2010

A: After the cork loudly popped out of the bottle it poured a reddish-amber color. Fanning out on top was a light khaki colored, one finger layer of foam that retained for ages. Carbonation was lively and lots of lace was left stuck in the glass. 
S: Tart berry, lemon, damp oak, sour cherry, and the slightest hint of dry/roasty malt.
T: Great flavors of tart berry/sour cherry, oak, and hints of tangy citrus.

Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured a massively hazy red-orange with a three finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and a hint of dark fruit upon warming up. The flavor was of sweet malt, excellent sour, nice tart, dark fruit, hint of funk, and a floral note on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is excellent. I must have more of this one!!! Definitely has an excellent aroma, but the flavor is other-worldly. I was really surprised how the floral note on the followthrough seems to cleanse you palate to prepare it for your next sip. Just purely amazing. This is probably my favorite Wild Ale that I have consumed to date without a doubt. Hope I can find something better in the future, but this one is going to be hard to top!
Batch 003! Massive thanks goes out to gcurlow for hooking this one up for beeruser and I to tick! Served from bottle into a Sweetwater snifter. Poured bright orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, wood, fruit, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, funk, wood, tart, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew still. I have been lucky to try this one multiple times and have never been disappointed. While this one did carry a slightly different flavor and aroma there really wasn't a huge difference between the two batches I've reviewed. However, the carbonation seemed to have dropped off a little bit on this one as it was a little older. Still definitely one of my favorite AWAs out there today. 4.5 appearance/4.5 aroma/4.5 tate/4 mouthfeel/4.5 overall 2,002 charactersthagr81us, Dec 08, 2010

I have had the opportunity to try this on tap and in the bottle quite a few times and it never ceases to amaze me every single time I have it.
Pours a deep brown with red highlights. Looks like rotten cherry juice, in the best way. 
Smells fantastic. Cherries, lots of tart acidity in the nose, a little bit of vinegar but it is subdued. There's a little bit of funk to it as well.
Taste is even better, no, MUCH better than the nose. This is possibly one of the most complex beers I've ever had, but I can't really tell... I'm too busy enjoying how amazing it tastes to care about complexity. Cherries. Tart, TART, yummy, sour, delicious cherries but not too fruity. Some of the wine taste comes in as well. If you're a wine lover, then you'll enjoy this. It's reminiscent of Rodenbach Grand Cru if you're looking for something to compare it to if you've never had it, but it is SO MUCH better. I get lost drinking this beer, and I can't get enough of it.
I'm literally thinking about moving out to Santa Rosa just so I can go to the Russian River brewpub and drink this every day. 1,091 charactersEstocker, Dec 08, 2010

A- Hazy orang/red body with a decent sized off white head resting on top.
S - Smell's like this one will be pretty sour. Also picking up hints of cherry. Oak notes are certainly present as well.
T - More funky and less tart than I was expecting. Really clean finish. Some cherry notes but not too much. Plenty of barrel flavor. Earthy notes are also in play
M - medium body with a good amount of carbonation. 
D - A nice sour indeed. Plenty of funk and other good wild notes. Not as sour as I would have liked but I've found that to be the case with most RR sours. I like this one better than Consecration and Temptation bt not as much as some other sours out there. I would certainly drink/buy this one again if I had the chance but wouldn't go too crazy trying to get it. 932 charactersjpmclaug, Dec 08, 2010

S: Sour, berrylike smell. Oak and sharp yeast.
T: Very tart candy sourness from the start. Some woody notes, fruit, light alcohol, and not much else. This beer is much more simple than I thought it would be from everyone elses description, but it is still very good. To me, it does taste like something is missing...
M: Crisp crisp crisp. Clean and tingly and bubbly.
D: Very high. I would drink this by the pitcher if it were possible. A really great beer. I love sours, and this one is no exception. However, I don't think it is the sour that all others should be judged by. 805 charactersJemonster, Dec 06, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had this on tap at TJ's Restaurant and Drinkery's 7th Anniversary event.
Lightly hazed cherry juice color w/ tiny bead ring for head - not expected to have much really, though. The lace clings in spots and the color is rosy w/ clarity that is transclucent as expected for the style. The smell has plenty of sweet scents yet a good dose of tart cherry in there too, the aroma gives a mild compliment of lemony sour with mild sweet cherry-like tinges from the wild yeast. The feel is vibrant, light dry and tangy with moderate acidity. the tartness is slight, not overly sour with moderately high carbonation and gentle berry juiciness.
 The flavor is so concentrated with fresh juiced tart cherry and light sweet flavors w/ dry tannic fruit skin notes. The mild pie-like cherry flavor is sweet and acidic at the same time giving a mildly astringent effect on the palate w/ a bit of bitterness from the hops but only slight and the oak gives a mild olive like bitter oily element to the fruity sour in the flavor. There is mild hop spice to accent all the oak and berry complexity. This is a fantastic wild ale, so surpremely drinkable which as Chris Lively said, Vinnie attempted a flavor akin to aged Orval, and he definitely achieved that. The flavor and drinkabililty go above and beyond. I was sad when I noticed it kicked in only a couple hours - so much cherry goodness. 1,379 charactersSlatetank, Dec 06, 2010

Appearance: The body of the beer is ruby coloration. The head is short lived white coloration. A thin rim of white rings the rim of my glass. Webbing of lacing marks the beers passage. 
Smell: I hesitate to call any wild ales aroma clean. Musty cellar aroma combine with tart semi sweet cherries grapes and oaken barrel. 
Taste: The flavor of the beer is loaded with tart cherries. Nice bracing bret sourness. Again I hesitate to call it a clean flavor but I love the brief sweetness of cherries and then the tartness nice oak tones noted to flavor. 
Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The sourness and the tartness are well balanced. The body is light and very refreshing. A very drinkable sour beer. The beer disappeared from my glass way too fast. This beer is an American classic. 914 charactersnlmartin, Dec 06, 2010

Beer pours with a wonderful effervescence a ruby and amber body with light tan to cream colored billowy head.
Aromas are sour cherry, wood chips, concord grapes and touches of caramel. Nice blend of sweet and sour, very balanced, no hops to speak of.
Flavor is just tremendous, wood, dark skin grapes, dried cherries, raspberry and a really knockout souring touch in the middle to finish. The mid range sweetness and caramel touch of the beer blends perfectly with the tart sour notes. 
Mouthfeel is perfect, well carbonated providing a prickly accentuation of the sweet and tart notes. Light bodied and refreshing in its tartness. 
Extremely drinkable delicious sour ale. 764 charactersPBoegel, Dec 05, 2010

The beer poured to be an amber color and it had fairly strong aroma of cherries. The taste was slightly sweet and was light in body. This beer was extraordinary and was easy to drink. I loved this beer and I would highly recommend it. 456 charactersChincino, Dec 05, 2010

Appearance: Poured from the bottle, this beer is a cloudy, dirty apple cider color. There's hardly any head, only a thin ring where the beer meets the glass.
Smell: Sweet cherries with some sour thrown in. There's also a mild oakiness to it that really rounds everything out nicely. Really great smelling beer. 
Taste: Sour and tart. The cherries which were really strong in the nose sort of take a backseat to the funk and the oak. Everything just melds together so well, such a great tasting beer.
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is perfect, body is light and refreshing. Really nailed it here.
Drinkability: An absolutely top notch beer. Each time I've had this beer I get more and more impressed with it. I highly recommend this beer to anybody that can get their hands on it. 901 characterskrisandajt, Dec 05, 2010

Supplication: Brown Ale aged in French oak Pinot Noir barrels with three strains of Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and sour cherries . 
7.0%ABV / 1.064 O.G / 27 BUs
Thanks to troywhittaker for sharing one of these with me, a pleasant surprise. I love brown ales, I love Pinot Noir, but I am a newb to this sour hype...
I appreciatte the tartness without being over done. White head on a golden/amber body. Aromas of cherry and wood. Complex taste of wine, cherry and mild tarness. Balanced by malt base less sour than I expected. A unique sipper for sure.
I was not able to write detailed notes on this one, but I plan to next time I get the opportunity to sample this one again. I am not scared of the sour just yet. 850 charactersunclejimbay, Dec 03, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Last review from notes and then I think I'm all caught up. Consumed 5/28/2010 at The Broad Axe Tavern (couldn't believe they had this in the bar. Also couldn't believe the price). 375 ml. bottle marked Batch 04x2. Unfortunately the bartender must not have known anything about this beer as she presented it in a pint glass. Hoping it doesn't detract from the experience...
A - Slightly amber-yellow color with a fluffy creamy colored head that fades quite quickly leaving very little lacing. Despite the pint glass, it looks very inticing.
S - Wow. Woody, oak, and brett right up front. Vinous as well (as hoped) as the pinot noir deffinitely comes out as does the cherris. Really smells quite fantastic. 
T - Extremely well balanced combination of woody oak, cherries, brett and lacto. Very bright and fruity wuth the cherries being oh so tasty. Everything seems to be working so well together. The sourness actually stays with you throughout the entire bottle which I found very nice.
M - Very carbonated and it works quite well. Medium bodied and actually quite silky despite the carbonation. Lactic acid bite at times in the throat, but nothing that detracts from the beer.
D - Very drinkable beer, especially for a sour. Everything is so well balanced that it makes it easy to drink the whole way through. Really can't wait to stock up on a few bottles of this baby. 1,376 charactersKAP1356, Dec 03, 2010

Appearance is good, about average for a fruit enhanced sour. Lacks a head, but this is typical of barrel matured sours.
Nose is bright and inviting with a sour cherry and citrus notes framing the sour yeast core. Lovely sour flavor without being too astringent. Lots of cherry and berry flavors expand on the palate.
Medium bodied with a nice balance of alcohol, texture, and tannins. Long, smooth finish. Very enjoyable! 542 characterscbarrett4, Dec 02, 2010

Pours a slightly hazy burnt orange color, somewhat pale with a ruby red tiny. When held to the light however, this beer is beautiful, deep ruby red with some orange mixed in, a solid stream of little bubbles rises from the bottom. Two fingers of very soft, beige head forms and slowly recedes, leaving a thick cap of haze and some nice lacing behind...
Loads of super fresh, powerful tart cherries fill the nose. The fruit aspect of this beer is intense and wonderful. A nice lactic sourness is evident and is tempered a bit by a good dose of funk/barnyard aromas and oak. Tartness does take a backseat to the funk after a few whiffs, wonderfully complex and very enticing smell...
Beer begins slightly tart with loads of funk in the finish. Dry and oaky, the barrels are much more evident in flavor than in aroma. Acidic and slightly fruity, was expecting a more intense dose of cherries given their abundance in the nose, but they kind of take a supporting role here. The earthy, barnyard/funk flavors, combined with a strong oak presence kind of subdue the cherry/fruit aspect of the taste. The finish is a strange combination of dry, dusty and musty basement with a biting acidity...
Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, yet the beer is silky. The tartness of the beer isn't quite to the puckering level, but the high acidity does start to eat at your palette. Finishes dry and dusty with a lingering acidity...
I really enjoy this beer. Nice and tart, but not overwhelmingly so. Wonderful complex aromas and flavors combine to make a highly drinkable beer that never gets old. The acidity is a little on the high side, but with sours, it's hard to complain about that. This may be my favorite American Wild Ale, as a Belgian Lambic fan, I'm usually let down by American Wilds, not the case here... 1,904 charactershawks10, Nov 30, 2010

Pours a hazed auburn with some thin wisps of film across the top, leaving a little collar around the rim of the glass, and a few streaks of lacing. 
Light, spritzy cherries with some lactic sour flairs in the nose, along with some faint funkiness. 
Plenty of bitter sourness right up front which is quickly followed by a wave of tart cherry flavor. Hints of green apple skin and citrusy rind mix in. The sour flavors continue to build towards the finish, where it becomes quite puckering, but is balanced by just the right amount of sweetness. Ends with lingering dryness, a touch of warmth, and one final punch of tart. 
Lighter medium bodied, very nice carbonation which isn't overdone, plenty of dryness in the feel. Drinks incredibly well, and the alcohol is just right. I could easily drink more than one of these if they weren't so expensive. 901 charactersxnicknj, Nov 27, 2010

Nose is quite a lot of wet, ripe cherries, not as sour as I remembered, field-like almost, very fresh and floral. Flavor is darker sour cherries, brett, tart and long on the finish. Sour and dry, a tad bit mineral like in the mid palate. Brett is nicely intertwined and body is effervescent as with most Russian River sours. More sour and expressive than this batch was at a younger age. 483 charactersJAXSON, Nov 20, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance- Golden with a nice head of champagne style bubbles. The continuous flow of carbonation from the bottom of my glass is a sight to behold.
Aroma- As with most RR beers this is my favorite part. The spice from the yeast and tartness are readily apparent from the first sniff and cause my mouth to salivate the way it did when I was 10 and I had a pack of Sour Patch kids.
Taste- Very tart upfront but the cherries and sweetness come through gradually and create a complex and acidic flavor.
Mouthfeel- A little bit thicker than I would like, but the excellent carbonation helps this out.
Drink- This is a sipper, let it sit and warm gradually as you work your way through the beer. It can last forever and never goes bad. But hardly what I would call easy drinking 777 characterscadaugherty, Nov 15, 2010

4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From bottle to flute glass
Pours an opaque, apricot-orange with effervescent carbonation and a small 1/4-inch head. The nose is sharp red wine vinegar and sour cherries, while Brett funk is all over the place. Even in the flute glass the aromas are pouring out.
As you sip, tart, puckering cherries surround your palate and the back of your tongue. This is as sour as I've tried a beer. But it's far from one-dimensional. The cherries combine with citrusy lemon, which carry into a distinctive Brett funk. There's some sweetness in the background, which tastes like it comes from grapes more than malts. This is a really phenomenal profile. With all of the untamed flavors in this ale, the hops are enough to create a drying effect, leaving the finish clean and slightly sour.
It feels light on you tongue, but there's plenty of carbonation to wash away any residue. It really has a festive feel, especially drinking from the flute glass.
Once you become accustomed to its puckering aspects, your taste buds are in for a complex, revolving treat. There is amazing flavor here, and the relatively moderate 7.5% will leave you somewhat coherent by the end of your glass. I'll be drinking this as often as I can. 1,213 charactersrand, Nov 09, 2010

Appearance: Looks like a deep brown apple cider. When held up to the light it glows dark red. Pours a fingers worth of light brown/tan head. Very dense. It fades slightly but clings to the outside of the glass and remains throughout the drink.
Smell: Cherries and citrus dominate. Some apple as well. Smells like a wine, very robust, makes my mouth water.
Taste: Sour, very sour, plenty of tart cherries, green apples as well. Alcohol comes through in the middle. The oak comes out really strong as well with the tannin. Again, makes my mouth water, the flavors are so strong. Also has a pucker effect.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a medium to high carbonation. The sourness and the tannin remind me of a chardonnay, and leave me with a dry finish in my mouth. I am not crazy about that dry finish.
Overall: The tannin and sourness mellow as the drink warms a little, which I like. The sourness really wakes up the palate, which I also like. I could have a couple of these a night. The flavors are bold and delicious. Just flat out different, tasty, and I want more. 1,166 charactersotto251068, Nov 07, 2010
4.21/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a thin pinkish red with lively carbonation and a beautiful spiderweb of lacing. Reminds me of a sangria, especially with its murky dark fruit coloration and slightly lighter build.
Smells of tart cherry, light musk and tropical fruit. It's pleasant, but surprisingly light on the standard sour and horse blankety aromas.
Taste has a bold tartness, with a very pronounced, Bretty finale. Cherry and mixed berry make up the fruit components, while the complex and subtle wood-barrel notes add a nice earthiness. The barreling also tempers the tartness, making for a masterful brew that allows all of the elements to shine on their own terms.
The beautiful tart smack also tingles the roof of the mouth, allowing the winey sweetness to resonate and linger. The balancing act is a profund one and I wouldn't expect anything less from Russian River.
The ABV even feels elegantly understated, allowing for a sippable, but endlessly dynamic ale. 948 charactersdeapokid, Nov 05, 2010

Beer received in trade courtesy of khumbard- thanks for a great trade!
A: beer appears a hazy dark orangeish/red with a thin white head. Leaves sticky lacing and has decent head retention.
S: huge notes of acid and oak up front, tartness from the lactobacillus, notes of funk and brett come through at the end. The brett is nicely balanced with the oak and lactic character. Some notes of cherries and vanilla in there as well.
T: as the beer rushes past all of the taste buds, there is an initial puckering from the acidty while notes of oak, vanilla make an appearance as well. Like the nose, there is a mild brett character mid palate and a nice tart cherry finish. The finish leaves the palate begging for more. Very well balanced sour!
MF: high carbonation, light body, crisp and refreshing
D: this is an all around great sour.. you have the nice big puckering qualities paired perfectly with cherries and just enough brett to really keep things interesting. 985 charactershomebrew311, Nov 05, 2010
4.02/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Presentation: Simultaneously unassuming/impressive-looking 375ml bottle, corked and caged. A HUGE thank-you goes out to hwwty4 for this extremely generous gift. Poured into my late great-grandfather's etched Belgian-style chalice.
Appearance: Under normal light, this beer pours what I would call rose (kind of a mix of ruby/golden tan), but when held up to the light it turns a beautiful bright orangey amber. The cap is ivory and, after receding, leaves a thick, creamy ring and islands of foam floating in the glass. Fairly highly carbonated.
Smell: Tons of fruit and light, elegant funk. Almost delicate aromas. Oddly enough, I'm not really getting cherries, but rather a pleasant mix of fruits. At first I was getting stone fruit (slightly underripe peaches) and maybe a hint of lemon cream. As this warms slightly, I started getting sweet strawberries and now, I think I'm finally getting the sweet/tart candied cherries. No oak present, but there is a hint of something like vanilla cream that's quite nice.
Taste: The cherries come through much stronger in the flavor; tart, slightly underripe, and juicy. There's just a little bit of alcohol present, as well as a dusty, dry, very lightly tannic woodiness. I'm still getting used to sours and so while I really, really like the flavors going on here, it takes me a minute to get past the tart, puckering blast at the beginning. At the beginning, I get hardly anything but tartness and a bit of dry tannin. After a few seconds, however, the tart cherry really begins to come out, and after the swallow, a of other fruity, funky flavors emerge. The cherry character of this reminds me slightly of the bright, natural sweet/tart character of New Glarus' Wisconsin Belgian Red, but there's much more going on in this beer, whereas the NG beer is all about the fruit (not that that's a bad thing). Here, the cherry flavors are supported/balanced by a whole lotta funkiness, a touch of alcohol, and some dry oakiness. I don't really get any malty character from this until I'm down near the bottom of the glass (and it's warmed quite a bit) and it's just a ghost of toasted brown malt. 
Mouthfeel: Vibrant, fairly highly carbonated, medium-bodied
Drinkability: Good, although sours are (at least not for me) quaffing beers. Still, one glass of this is warming, yet refreshing at the same time. I like!
Conclusion: I'm so glad I finally got to try one of these beers. Again, a huge, HUGE thank you to the guy who hooked me up with this. Between hwwty4 and tolann, I've now gotten to try two of Russian River's most highly-touted beers. Pliny the Elder absolutely blew me away. It was everything I expected and more. This did not have quite the same effect, but it was still quite enjoyable. The aromas are absolutely out of this world. One of the best wild brews I've encountered. The flavors are very nice here as well. The sourness here wasn't a problem for me; it was lightly puckering and just about right IMO. The flavors were very nice. If I could change one thing it would be to just ratchet the woodsy dryness back a bit. 3,087 charactersBedetheVenerable, Nov 05, 2010

T: Taste really corresponds well with the smell. Tart, acidic sour apple cider, sour cherries, puckering green olives (don't know if this is normal, but I'm picking up on a good bit of it), and a semisweet oakiness that takes some effort to find. One of the most complex beers that I've ever had. 
M: Amazing mouthfeel. The high level of carbonation really makes this come alive as you let it roll around on your tongue. Succinct waves of its complexity reveal themselves in a way that is surprising with each sip, retreating to a dry, biting finish. This was really a pleasure to try.
D: Overall, this is very drinkable, and if the sour complexity didn't grab the attention so well, 375ml would be gone very quickly. While it's not a "big beer," this is certainly one to nurse; the more time you spend with it, the more you get out of it (or at least that was my experience). This is certainly one to seek out. 1,231 charactersMississipping, Nov 04, 2010

Batch 005x4
Cherry brown body, capped by a slim bone white cap. Retention is rather unimpressive, slim head soon becomes a lasting ring. Lacing is surprising especially considering the lack of head.
Slightly acidic tartness coupled with candied cherries ooze from the snifter. Brown malt base provides a sturdy platform for the funky cherry aromas to build off of. Musty rustic smells build with warmth
Biting tartness and sour cherry flavor is puckering up front. Toasted brown malt and subtle chocolate evolves midpalate. Hints of oakiness barely noticeable but pleasant through out. 
Light and crisp body with lively carbonation. Dry finish though the combination of sweet and tart cherries linger on the tongue.
Supplication is an absolutely outstanding beer. The balance between tart and sweet, complex and approachable is ridiculous. Drinkablility is amazing, though I say that one bottle would be the perfect serving I am certainly wishing I had another bottle.
Batch 002 Thanks to Oreo
The flavor changes significantly with age. The taste resembles more of a Flanders Red. Puckeringly sour cherry upfront with notes of vinegar. What is lost in complexity is gain in intensity. Still an awesome beer. 1,269 characterskzoobrew, Oct 26, 2010
4.07/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Looks nice. Not as striking as Cons. nor as beguiling as Tempt.
Smells like a theoretical cross betwen those two. Animal notes. Pronounced vinous influences. Barrel (wine barrel) aromas. Similar to being in a winery.
Tastes like... Sour. Of course. But little else. Strong richness to help, but only hints of fruit and little real character.
Mouthfeel is excellent. Crisp, refreshing. Carries the strong flavors through the palate for maximum effetc, but sadly lacks some of the nuance of its brethren.
Drinkability suffers because it doesn't beg for more consumption. Great as a few ounce pour. After that, it gets burdensome. 631 charactersoregone, Oct 26, 2010

Batch :04X5
First sour ever so lets see what these are all about.
A:pours a burnt orange color with an appealing amount of cloudiness. The head is bubbly lace in the shade buttermilk. Its leaving nice thick lace sheets comprised of foamy bubbles. The top of the head is smooth and frothy looking
S:gobs and gobs of sour cherries and yeasty funk. No booze present in the smell but its almost like brandy soaked cherries. Very sweet smelling and I cant really pick out a ton of brett but it is apparent.
T: WOW. I have heard sours were interesting and that in no way could describe this beer. No amount of words could ever describe this much flavor. First a TON of sour, all different types. mainly cherries but there is a reminiscence of other fruits as well like apples but its mostly a berry sourness. There is a sweet flash almost as things shift from sour to smooth. No off flavors to be found or any alcohol. The aging has done amazing for this beer as all the types of yeast now work as one smooth complex flavor that melds perfectly with the sour from the cherries. The finish is clean and smooth with no aftertaste. I am very impressed.
M:Carbonation is almost the the level of champagne but it fits this style perfectly. Lots of bubbles keep things moving along nicely. Its very nice although im not really sure what the mouthfeel is supposed to be on these or how difficult it is to attain but there is for sure nothing wrong with it.
D: This is great beer. By all accounts this beer is delicious. I cant imagine having a lower quality version. The sourness does take a little getting used to after the initial sip but its all world class from there. 1,706 charactersFieldzy27, Oct 26, 2010

375ml Cork and Caged bottle into a snifter.
A- Pours a real dark orangish brown with loads of carbonation!! First beer i've ever poured that fizzed. Huge 2 finger white head that's not going anywhere and LLAB!
S- Real strong champagne and cherries up front with a nice sour apple note in the background and pale malts.
T- Strong cherry sourness up front that fills up your mouth and leaves it bitter and dry. Also some really nice champagne flavors that give it a nice carbonated fullness and sweetness as well. Definitely some yeast in there as well as some nice pinot noir flavors coming through as well. 
M- Sour, tart, and bubbly. Medium body with a perfect amount of carbonation that really tickles the tongue and leaves a nice dried up finish in your mouth.

4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Been excited to try this for a while, Batch 5. 
Poured a light brown color with a little bit of off-white head. Nose is pretty pungent, with the cherries really coming through, some tartness, and big funky/musty notes which I really like. Taste follows through similarly--it's not as tart as I might expect, but the funky oaky musty nature of this is really really great. Very enjoyable. Only thing I might hope for is for the cherries to shine through a bit more on the palate (for some reason I'm not getting big cherry flavor). A very well-rounded sour flavor. MF is pretty big for a sour, pillowy, well-carbonated, drying on the finish with some tannins. Very drinkable, I'm sad that it's gone.
Another great beer from RR. When compared to Temptation, I feel that this is a less interesting but potentially more quality brew. Very very good, though again, I'm not sure if it was worth the $17 price tag (for a 375 mL). At half that price it might be the beer I buy exclusively. 983 charactersLordAdmNelson, Oct 20, 2010

T- Sour, tart, with cherries, some sweetness, funk and barnyard then sour green crab apples coupled with a dry finish. 
M- Nice lively carbonation, tart and sour on the finish, very smooth on the palate and dry.

4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Batch 005x4 -- poured a vivid, ruby-tinged rust into a tulip with a thin film of tight white head. Powerful aroma of cherries, leather, grape, and spicy Belgian yeast.
Slightly high carbonation and a light, dry, champagne-like mouthfeel. Intense cherry up front that begins with a tinge of sweetness before the puckering sour apple tartness sets in. Wine-like notes of oak and alcohol warmth emerge before the slightly bitter and funky finish.
Absolutely delicious, as was to be expected. I splurged and tried this and Russian River's Temptation over the course of a weekend, and while I preferred the subtleties of Temptation just a bit more, Supplication bowls you over with bold and complex flavors that are worth the price of admission. 742 charactersgrittybrews, Oct 19, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bought a bottle and poured into a tulip glass.
My first time pouring bottled beer into a glass but I think I got it to have a decent amount of head and it opened up to some pleasant cider aromas and cherry and malt, the alcohol is also surprisingly apparent on the nose. I was expecting a really bracingly tart beer having had my fair share of berlinner-weissbiers but this was surprisingly toned and balanced. The heaviness of the alcohol goes well to balance out the tartness of the souring bacteria. cherry and yeast are noticeable but are all welcome and quite gorgeously done. For a brett beer I detected no barnyard funk or anything like that, it was just beautifully pleasant and earthy. The aging in pinot barrels brings out some trace wine-like flavors. This really is a beautiful beer, it's not bracingly sour as I was expecting but it's so balanced between sour, and the alcohol and just everything it truly is a wonderful beer. 940 charactersdigkv, Oct 16, 2010

Quite a unique aroma consisting of funky yeast, cherries, pepper-like spice, hints of oak, and vinous grape from the noir.
Sour flavor up front with cherries and grapes, followed by yeast, only faint hints of the oak, and a tart finish.
Medium to light in body with generous carbonation, crisp yet tart, and a bit acidic.
This is an amazing blend of flavors and aromas, but not so dominant that it affects how easy it is too drink. Great beer! 603 charactersCHADMC3, Oct 16, 2010

Taste is very tart and funky, pretty mouth-puckering and slightly fruity although it's not overtly sweet. There's almost no barnyard funk to it which makes it a bit more drinkable. Very dry and fairly crisp finish. Very good beer. 487 characterskingcrowing, Oct 15, 2010

Appearance: Ruby red with a hint of light brown in color. Pours a really large fizzy head that recedes pretty quickly into nothing. 
Aroma: Tart cherries, pinot noir, vinegar, and some nice funk. The aroma really does just fill the room after opening this. Really balanced and complex. The tart cherries are probably the biggest note in the aroma, but all the other notes are definitely present and contributing to teh aroma.
Taste: Really tart cherries stand out upfront. The sourness definitely is the first thing you notice. After the initial blast of sour, the pinot noir, vinegar, and barnyard funk really start to stand out. All some together really nicely. A puckering finish. 
Mouthfeel: Light bodied and with a lot fo carbonation. Very crisp. Also very acidic.
Drinkability: I wanted more than the one bottle after finishing. The alcohol was not overpowering at all, but definitely was warming.
Overall, the single best American wild ale I've ever had. Extremely complex and flavorful. All the elements work perfectly together and don't overpower. My highest recommendation. 1,217 charactersGosox8787, Oct 14, 2010

A- Nice big pop from the cork opening this bottle. Poured nice light brown with good size head to it. 
S- Lots of cherry notes to this aroma. Very small hints from the oak aging.
T- Very interesting first sip. The tartness isn't overbearing but allows you to enjoy each drink. The sour cherries were just right and gave a good taste amazingly. 
M- Nice tart, crisp, almost a little dry. Medium body with lots of carbonation.
T- Was very excited to try my first wild ale and it didn't let me down. Thought maybe it would be a little to much, but it had great balance and good taste. The acidity to the beer probably would stop me from another bottle that night, but would drink another one anytime. 815 charactersHosP, Oct 14, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Over the past year, I've had this beer probably six times at the least. Every time I do, I hearken back to a day at O'Brien's Pub in San Diego when a couple of my friends and I were at their Russian River day. We had two goblets of Supplication, a pint of Pliny, and starting to feel the alcohol, we picked up a Beatification. Then, in a moment of stupidity or brilliance (or perhaps both) we decided to drop the $95 bucks and buy the 3 liter Batch 2 Supplication. It was epic, and the bottle crowns my bottle collection. A day I'll never forget.
Anyway, about the beer:
Appearance: Nothing particularly remarkable here. Hazy-red brown brew with an almost oddly white head that laces lightly. The carbonation is mild, and not too much in the way of clingy foam. 
Smell: Whew, there's that Russian River tartness. Big sour notes of cherry, oaky wine, leathery and bretty funk, and just general tartness. The pucker is on!
Taste: Man, this is what a cherry sour should be. The Pinot barrels really add the oak-wine quality that just pairs perfectly with the tart cherry and sweet-sour combo that Russian River always seems to do to perfection. Puckering and dry on the back end, finishing with the tart cherry as the lasting flavor. Taste continues to evolve as she goes along, providing a steadily sour, funky, cherry goodness from first drop to the last. Just delicious. 
Mouthfeel: Tart, dry, and sour. Nothing too acidic or astringent, which is appreciated. Sometimes I wish it slightly less dry, but still very good. 
Driinkability: I have had this beer a half-dozen times now, and it's still ringing true as one of the better Wild Ales of its kind. I have had over a liter and a half of this beer in a sitting, and I am positive I'll never do that again for several reasons, namely my digestive tract. That being said, the beer was so fantastic it was very tasty to the last drop. Sure, I tend to like the citrusy sours slightly more, but this beer is nothing short of outstanding. 1,991 charactersnomomentwasted, Oct 13, 2010
3.72/5  rDev -17.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Supplication comes in a pricey little 375 mL bottle. (I think I paid $12.00?) The bottle looks neat though, with a long, bulged neck like a miniature version of it's 750 mL big brothers. Corked and caged. Served at 47°F.
A: Uncorked, revealing a swirling mist in the bottle. Pours into my NB goblet a cloudy, light copper, peachy brown, that's too dark for an amber but lighter than a typical brown. A creamy, one-finger sandstone head emerges, with just a tinge of pink. 
S: Sour cherries, which undoubtedly had been eagerly anticipating uncorking, fill the room before the pour. This brew is almost overwhelmingly sour and complex. The nose is packed with vinegar, as well as clove, cinnamon, Morello cherries, and a slight, salty, barnyard funk. Overall the smell is an intense sour acid with accents of warm, herbal Christmas notes. The background spice is phenolic and slightly solventy.
T: The taste is predominantly dry, woody, and tart. It's very complex, but it's a well past center on the sour scale, so it's hard for me to decide if I love it or not. The carbonation and sourness hit first, but then a solventy hotness follows. The flavor also finishes with more fresh-cut oak and vanilla than any other sour I've tasted.
M: This wild is highly carbonated, so the effervescence foams in the throat and causes major burpage. The bubbles from the foam nucleate and explode in the mouth, but the cream makes the bursting bubbles and ensuing foam stick to your mouth and throat. There is also enough sourness to bring on some puckering and pangs in the jaw.
D: I would say drinkability is severely limited on cost alone, but as far as the beer itself goes, the real factor is your appreciation of very sour beers. I tend to avoid more acidic beer styles like Flanders Red, but I would consider this to be right at my limit for sourness. Medium. 1,857 charactersSPThirtyThree, Oct 13, 2010

Cherry and strawberry notes burst forth from the solid carbonation and leave the mouth tingling with joy. Wine and fruit in the crisp finish and I can only say it was worth the wait.

S:Can definitely smell the tartness of the Brett and cherries but something else sets this wild apart from others. It has a scent as though it has been intensely purified. It has a sense of clear, crispness while most others of this style are murky with a tart outline.
T:Cherries, slightly sweet cherries at first, lingering into sour cherries then Brett. 
M:Beautiful. As though this brew were created in layers so that we could taste it that way. This brew seems to cascade across my tongue, revealing each layer of flavor in a methodical sense.
D:This wild is highly drinkable as the more in depth I get into this brew, the more characteristics are uncovered.
This was my first brew from RR(thanks to my good friend Jay & his bro for importing this from Philly), and while it isn't the beer I'd most like to try from them(PtE,PtY, hint;anyone want to trade?), nor a style I try a lot, I was highly impressed as I have had my fair share of wilds and this one FAR exceeds any of the others. 1,184 charactersgabeerman, Oct 09, 2010

4.12/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4My second time having this one. Batch 005x2. The first time I was not prepared in the least. I love both Temptation and Consecration, two other sour beers from Russian River, and I was excited for the comparison.
The pour brought me a beer with about a 1/2 finger head that I thought would disappear after time. It didn't. The head gave a little lacing, which was nice. Clear amber beer. Looked good but not outstanding.
Amazing aroma of sour cherries, hints of malt, dust.
The first sip really got me excited. Big pucker to start, then mellowing to cherries and actually a little sugar. That was very short lived. Within a few sips it was nothing but bright sourness and sour cherries. Done well, but missing that little twist of complexity. Or maybe it's me.
Good mouthfeel and carbonation. Big bubbles, but still bright. Relatively light body, fitting the style. 
Drinkable, but I'm only ever having one. And at this price, there are many better offerings. 964 charactersChizoad, Oct 06, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got this as an extra from nerd. Poured into a tulip. Batch 005X1. Light brown with a reddish tint to it. There is a light brown head that rests on top; about a quarter inch thick.
Smells slightly sour, a hint of oak is noticed in the background. I get a good whiff of cherry vanilla as well. This doesn't smell overly sour, allowing a more complex aroma from the other scents.
The taste starts with just the slightest bit of vanilla sweetness, and follows with a nice sour finish. Nicely balanced, but still sour forward.
The mouthfeel here his nicely done. The carbonation has a nice prickliness to it, and the body fills the mouth nicely when quaffed.
As far as sours go, this is highly drinkable, but I will resist the urge to gulp it down and make it last. 764 charactersandrewinski1, Oct 06, 2010
4.14/5  rDev -8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap at the Blue Dog Tavern the other day.
Supplication pours an apricot amber color with fairly good head retention and lacing. On the nose, this beer is quite vinous, showing an iimpressive array of grapes, vanilla, wine and light sour. The flavor profile replicates the nose for the most part, except I'm getting a bit more wine vinegar and sour funk. The sour component definitely dominates the flavor profile, though it's not so over the top as to be unenjoyable. This beer is hugely flavorful with no more than a medium bodied mouthfeel, and the finish is long, winey and sour. This beer has almost an electric component to the flavor profile, at least that's how the sour hits me on the finish. Drinkability is pretty good, with the alcohol nearly unnoticeable. Am not a huge fan of sours beers, but this is pretty fun to drink (though I can't imagine drinking a whole lot of it). However, I confess the sour component does seem a bit more intense on draft then I recall experiencing from the bottle. 1,010 charactersJohn_M, Oct 05, 2010

Pours a purplish brown with a fluffy off-white head. Nice lace.
Smell is a little alcoholic, but includes pleasant notes of musty wood, cherries, and strawberry. Kind of like a weak Oud Bruin.
Tastes... not too good. There is nothing but sour abrasion that tastes like Band-Aids and vinegar. Not the yummy vinegar, but the stuff old wine turns into. It is not extreme, but is at the forefront. Now I love hugely sour beers, but the tartness should be balanced by sweetness, not adhesive. The cherry flavor, if it is there at all, is completely buried. It's like this bottle was picked off the beer tree before it was ripe.
Mouthfeel is wonderful, just like every other RR I've had.
This isn't terrible, but it's a pretty poor showing that I won't seek out again, at least not this batch. I'll edit my review if a future or past batch comes my way.
***UPDATE*** Re-Review, batch 5 x 3
OK, maybe it was a batch issue, maybe I had an off night. Whatever the case, here is the edit.
The beer in my glass right now tastes pretty great, and smells less like alcohol and more like a chocolate cherry Avery Brabant. The adhesive and white vinegar flavors are nowhere to be found, and the sour cherry just shines, along with notes of currant and strawberry. There's also a striking (red?) wine component behind the tartness. It's about as sour as Temptation and Ithaca Brute, which to me is perfect.
Changes I made in the scores:
Aroma 3.5 to 4
Taste 2.5 to 4.5
Drinkability 2.5 to 3.5 1,496 characters7ways, Oct 04, 2010

Poured into a Snifter 
A: Pours a reddish brown with a small head on top. Supplication looks like a glass of apple cider with a light topping of foam. The head dissipates very quickly.
S: The Brett, Lacto, and Pedio blend together to give this a good musty, funk on the nose. 
T: The Brett and Lacto create a musty barnyard flavor on the front, while the sour cherries add to the tartness of the finish. I am picking up slight notes of pinot noir on the finish as well.
M: Very carbonated as the bubbles tingle the tongue.
D: This is a sipper as the funk is strong but not overpowering on the taste. ABV is not too high at 7%, but the flavor will keep you drinking this beer slowly. Complex, sour, and very enjoyable. 731 charactersSiepJones, Oct 04, 2010
4.26/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a vibrant orange colour with delicious dense head, about 2cm thick, retaining well with craters bubbling on the top. Stunning ring of lace is left behind. Slight haze shows a slow but steady stream of bubbles. A few floaties chunks which are a bit unnerving, but otherwise damned nice.
Smell is very funk-é, with a lot of tart yeast aromas coming off that, hints of cranberry and citrus zest with a slight paw-paw note as well. Slight brassy fragrance as well. Seems a bit simple, but decent, yeah.
Taste starts out sour, stays sour. Kind of vinegary on the front, with more of that brassy metallic character, then gets really pleasantly sweet actually, early on the mid, with a sweet-and-sour-sauce flavour and maybe some lemon squash. Lemon juice is the dominant flavour on the back, lots of citric acid with a very slight rubbery character as well. Nice fresh zest on the very back kind of clips off the sourness so there's isn't much tartness left lingering. Yeah, very nicely done - potentially repellent but is made crisp and refreshing. Good sipper for flavour but also very good for just throwing back - again, like lemon squash.
Good body to it, and no harshness from the wild yeast. Pretty damned nice texture, actually.
Yeah, I like this a lot. It's sour and interesting, but really nicely quaffable. A very steady and skilled brewing hand is behind this. Great Summer or Spring quencher. 1,410 characterslaituegonflable, Oct 01, 2010

Poured into a chalice, showed a beautiful hazy golden with yeast visible, good frothy white head. Smell of bitter fruits, cherry slightly present in the nose, super earthy and yeasty smell. Taste was refreshing and crisp up front, sweet then balanced out by sour fruits and dry finish that left me wanting more after every sip.

A - Beer pours a dark brown color with ruby highlights. Head is a good 1 inch but fades rather quickly. 
S - All I can say is wow. Tons of sour cherry and even some oak notes. Filled with beautiful funk.
T - Heavily acidic kick upfront that makes me pucker. Sour fruits soon come pouring through and it finishes with a mustiness that tastes like your breathing in a cave.
M - Carbonation danced on the tongue.
D - I could drink these all night. I waited what seemed like forever to try this and it was worth every minute. 616 charactersCMW, Sep 29, 2010

looked different, not something that I would normally see. Darkish brown, good strong apple smell and sour too.

Aroma was full of tartness, like a lambic but without any funky barnyard stuff in there. Maybe a slight cherry character, but it is slight. 
Taste was very tart and sour with some wood in there -- very wine like in taste though. Some nice malt character in here. It has some malty sweetness (though it's not sweet in any usual way). Bit of tart cherry flavor. Complex and remarkably clean in flavor. 
Mouthfeel was solid but bright, spritzy on the tongue. It would be ridiculously easy to drink several pints of this if it weren't very hard to get in Alabama and not so expensive. Great stuff. 785 charactersmklinger, Sep 27, 2010

Supplication was my 2nd beer from Russian River, after Consecration, and so my expectations were set high.
From the bottle:
"Ironically, Vinnie decided his winemaking days were through when he discovered it takes just twenty-one days to make beer. Years later it takes him over a year to make this beer!"
For my part, I'm thankful Vinnie is still patient.
A: Deep mahogany brown, 1 finger soapy head, dissipates rapidly.
S: Bloody. Rich and tart, can smell the cherries working in there.
T: Clean. Smooth and rich. Mega-tart in the finish, cherries hit hardest there and linger.
F: Rich and smooth.

A: Got a nice pop when I open this and foam slowly started to rise to the top of the bottle. Pours a brownish cherry red. Leaves a 1/2 finger of white head with fairly good retention. Crazy amount of active carbonation that I can see in the glass. 2nd pour was a bit cloudy
S: Sour tart cherries/raspberries. A kick of brett/funkiness up front. Occasionally notes of oak
T: Just like sour cherry pie (if such a thing existed). Not overwhelming sourness, but definitely gets me in the jaw. Tart fruit puree and an oakiness round things out
M: As mentioned above, fairly tart but nothing crazy. Crisp, dry. Light, great carbonation
T: Very easy drinking wild/sour. Not overly tart so I had no issues finishing the bottle. Probably wouldn't drink any more though as I can feel the acidity getting to my stomach. Need to land another of these, so good 938 charactersBrez07, Sep 25, 2010

A. Bright red/amber with some orange highlights around the edges topped by 1 inch of fluffy white head. Quite an exceptionally good looking beer. A steady stream of small champange style bubbles is present giving this beer a very lively look. As the head fades into a collar only a couple light swirls are needed to revive a solid half inch.
S. Very tart acidic cherry presence initially that is accompanied by some bright lemon and bitter/sour underripe grape notes. Quite oaky as well with a touch of vanilla, also some definite funky/barnyard brett aspects.
T. Initial puckering tartness, big acedic acid cherry flavors. The bitter/sour unripe red grape aspect is more pronounced in the taste than the smell and really adds another layer of complexity. Sour lemon, earthy brett and evident oak flavors really work wonders in this beer. My favorite flavor combination of any Russian River wild ale I have tried. 
M&D. Light, lively, well carbonated. The complexity of this beer really helps the drinkability as I find myself continually sipping to dissect all the different aspects that go into this beer.
A great wild ale, I'm glad to be getting into craft beer when this style is really being developed by american brewers. 1,264 charactersDspohn, Sep 24, 2010

Aptly described, strong aromas of cherries and oak, with tastes to match. The beer is slightly sour tasting, but even stronger sourness to the smell. A highly refined package, and a treat whenever afforded. Russian River doesn't mess around, and neither should you. So drink Russian River. A premium beer with very classic sour notes, well aged, with a fine wood finish. (By the way, I think this is my worst review for a Russian River beer, so really, if you have the chance drink everything you can by them) 603 charactersmsmezher, Sep 24, 2010

Pours a somewhat medium brown, with a smallish white head. Aromas of red grapes, tart cherries and wood. On the palated, this one is bracingly sour, with fresh cherries and oak fighting the balance battle. Another nice effort from the folks at Russian River. 432 charactersemmasdad, Sep 23, 2010

Pours a ruddy brickish brown with some thin off-white head. Aroma is pure sour sour sour cherries. Black cherry, fruit leather, and dried leaves.
Palate is WOW super sour! Big fat bing cherry, black cherry and lots of citric acid-like acidity. That fruit-leather thing is there, very stewed/preserved fruit like density. Tanned leather too, raspberry jam, blackberries, and all sorts of sour fruit.
Finish is long and sour, surprisingly (sarcasm) focused on cherries.
Notes: This is not tart, this is sour. I really enjoy sour cherry beers, but didn't find this one to be as complex or enjoyable as it's trumped up to be. It's very clean as others have noted, but the complexity level doesn't rise to the occasion. Don't see the value for the money (quoted as $14). That's not to say that this is not a well made beer and clearly unique - I just personally don't find it that interesting. 996 charactersSFLpunk, Sep 22, 2010

I am finding that american wild ales seem to fall in two categories... failed belgian attempts made sour and stored by knowledgable brewer... and the sour intentionals. This is the latter. there is no intent to save a missed beer style. this was very much so a goal in mind.
pour is orange crimson cloudy with almost no head. White bubbles. Nose of tart. The palate is very much so that as well. Mild wood and floral lambic qualities, cherry tart, the black berry in the finish as a mineral fused with the malt. Could use some more of that. A fantastic quality the unites malt and sour fruit. 666 charactersrtepiak, Sep 20, 2010

Sm- Tart cherries, oak, funk, and a roasted toffee hiding in the back. 
Ta- Cherries, but not very pronounced. The tartness is there but is seems to come from the yeast not the fruit. Funk is minimal and comes through with some barnyard smells. The malts are rich and have a some sweet caramel, toffee flavors.
MF- Small bubbles with minimal carbonation. Nice.
DR- Amazing. Another winner that can be savored slowly (because you don't want it to end) over and over. 544 charactersgueuzer, Sep 20, 2010

A:Poured into my Duvel tulip, this brew pours a burnt orange with a thick bubbly head, leaving some lace as the glass empties. Definitely impressive, but not stunningly impressive.
S: The aroma is sugary sour cherries and cranberry. Tart fruit are all in the aroma. Tart fruit dominates. Seems like the Oak Barrel aging smoothed some yeasty clove/spice that I would have loved to have smelled more of.
T: Wonderfully sour without being offensive. Being new to the style, it seems like brewers struggle to make a brew flavorful without over doing the sour. This brew is tart, fruity, balanced. Clove and spice replace hops as the tingle and sting on the back of the pallet. 
MF: The mouthfeel is light and dry on the finish. Unique to many other beers, and a little creamy at times.
D: Drinkability is great, like I said this is not a harsh beer.
Overall, I do like Supplication and will seek out other RR sours. If it were me, I brew this beer up with some more yeasty Belgium inspired spicy clove, which would help to massage the pallet and give a good contrast to the sourness of this brew. Very interesting indeed. Note to RR...I like the old style bottles better! 1,271 charactersTKEbeerman, Sep 19, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sampled this as part of my own personal sampling. I had both Consecration and Supplication at the same time. This poured a light brown with a white head. The aroma had a far subtler sour presence compared to the Consecration. The same could be said for the taste also. While the Consecration felt like an attack on your tastebuds, the Supplication was less intense while still having a very pleasant sour, fruity flavor. I don't know enough about the process to tell whether the main difference is the Cab vs. Pino barrel, but when having both at the same time it's very obvious which is which. I could see myself drinking quite a few of these (that is if I could afford it) since it is more mellow and doesn't leave your tastebuds totally exhausted by the end. Like every RR beer I've had so far, this is very well done and highly recommended. 844 charactersjonvan04, Sep 18, 2010
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep light golden-brown colour, with a fine bubbled and incredibly dense head of white foam. Lacing is superb. Not just patterns, but full sheets of bubbling sticking to the edge of the glass. Odd, slightly chunky static carbonation as it's swirled, as though the bubbles get caught in clumps. Really lovely looking brew.
Very full and very lovely nose of oak, acidity, crushed vegetation, sour fruit, wood shavings... I could go on. Very sharp, extremely oaky and wine-like and extremely intense. Lovely complexity.
Immediate acidity on the front palate, but it mellows just divinely to earthy wood characters, with a hint of cherry pip, green apple skin and a resinous hint of rubbed lemon rind. I love the way it just relaxes on the tongue, giving you the full force of the acidity straight up, before almost melting to something soft and supple. Mouthfeel is crisp and subtle, but it gives this three-dimensional dance throughout, starting rigid and sharp and finishing languid and soft.
What a lovely drop of beer, and a truly excellent wild ale. There are reasons this is rated as highly as it is. In terms of straight complexity, I think I actually prefer RR's Consecration, but this is probably a more true, more pure and more raw example of the genre. 1,271 characterslacqueredmouse, Sep 18, 2010

Brownish amber color with one finger of head that had good retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing. Aroma is astonishing. Tart cherries, oak, wine, funk, and a touch of vinegar are melded together beautifully. The flavor is not a letdown either. The first sip was very, very tart and lip puckering. But subsequent sips brings a more tame experience as the tastebuds become accoustemed to the delightful flavors. Hints of cherries, dry malt, wood, and some funk. Acidity is approaching high levels but is not overwhelming. Light body but is just slightly overcarbonated.
Another Russian River beer that just blew me away. One 375ML bottle is enough for a session and I am sure a hangover will follow as it does with sour beers. 743 charactersmorimech, Sep 17, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The Russian River "ation" series of sour ales is really good. They have yet to let me down and this one is no different.
The beer is a cloudy brownish yellow with bits of dead yeast slowly floating to the base of the glass. It pours with a medium head that is a lovely yellowish white and sticks around till the glass is finished.
The nose entices the senses with cider, apple, oak, and a little apricot. There are some faint notes of almost a chemical smell as well as some heat and for that it got marked a down a little on the smell.
The ale has an orchard fruit profile with notes of apple, pear, and a bit of cherry on the tip of the tongue. The beer starts sweet and then bites you at the end with its lovely sour characteristic.
The body is thin but balanced by a good amount of carbonation which adds to the sour nature of the beer.
Overall this is an exceptional sour beer and I tend to choose it when I'm in the mood for something out of my ordinary. I definitely recommend this beer to any sour lover and its also a great beer for those who aren't the typical beer drinkers. 1,090 charactersTheBeerCarl, Sep 17, 2010

Sour cherries was the most upfront aroma, some grapes and yeast were also present. I love smelling a beer and already knowing that it's going to be something special. Tasted very similar, lots of sour cherry wang. It's rather sweet at first, every now and then some bitterness came through on the back of the tongue. All sorts of funk going on here, a joy to sit and sip. The carbonation kept things exciting but I didn't find it to be as bubbly as I had expected, still very crisp and light on the tongue. It was a pretty intense goblet of sweet sour funk so it's not something you're going to want all night but it was still delightfully drinkable, almost deceivingly so, drink it slowly. 867 charactersbiggerboat88, Sep 16, 2010

A: There is a 1.5 finger off-white head on this amber beer that has a slight pinkish tint. There is excellent head retention and lacing.
S: The main smells that I get from this beer are cherries and grapes. There is also a bit of yeast earthiness on the nose at the end. Not quite as intense of a smell as I had anticipated.
T: Lots of sour cherries up front. A decent amount of earthy funk in there with some tannin as well. It's strange, because for a brief second, right in the middle, I could swear I was drinking a wine; somewhere right between the sourness and the hit of carbonation.
M: I know this is supposed to be bottle fermented and a higher carbonation style, but for me this was still a bit over carbonated. Otherwise, a very nice mouthfeel.
D: With the high level of carbonation and intense sourness, this one is not all that drinkable for me. It was nice to try, but was a slow sipper and I feel like I would quickly develop a stomach ache if I had to much or drank it too fast...Kind of like sour skittles. 1,071 charactersglazeman, Sep 15, 2010

It was just amazing and I knew things were heading in the right direction.
It poured a deep ruby amberish hugh with an off white tiny bubbled head that fizzed off somewhat quickly, yet always left a nice thin layer hanging out on top.
ZING! That's what I thought as the sour cherry pit flavor blanketed my tastebuds. It was instant and the high tartness and slight bitterness with a touch of sweetness really meshed perfectly together. The slightly drying yet clean bitterness lingers on begging for another sip. This beer just got better and better after each sip, as it warmed.
It's a well carbonated wild, but is not overdone. It tickles the tongue with a pleasant fizziness.
I think Supplication might be too easy to drink and the 7% abv was nowhere to be found. I may have liked this a bit too much for my own good. 993 charactersjefferz5000, Sep 15, 2010

The appearance is a slightly cloudy rose hued orange color. With a very pleasant off-white head made of delicate bubbles that has great retention and beautiful lacing.
The aroma is of wine up front, with hints cherry, oak and a light sourness.
Sour fruit flavors upfront. Notes of fermented cherries, oak and pinot noir. Also very light malt notes.There is an extremely faint booziness to the finish. As in the nose, these are incredibly complex flavors.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite crisp in the finish, without becoming overly dry. The carbonation is quite active.

375ml bottle, batch 04x1.
A- Well, the head here is a surprise. Many wilds that Ive had will have a really big head that fizzes up loudly and disappear violently quick. This one, however, is quite strong with tons of lacing. It will fade in size but it never really goes away. The beer is a deep, rich, earthy red. Totally hazed, but back lighting makes it glow with a more orange hue. 
S- This beer benefits from a little time to breathe. At first it was weak but once it wakes up the nose is a trip to funky town. Tart cherries kick things off. Wood is one of the strongest elements here, it brings along a damp log essence. Red wine, a cheesiness, and a little bit of cellar and cardboard. 
T- Very woody, but its so delicious. From there some bread dough comes along but gets blasted with sour cherries, red wine and some funk. A bit of vinegar. The finish is all bread crust and weathered wood. 
M- Very highly carbonated, but further along in the bottle it dies down a touch. The finish is very dry, tart and stripping. 
This beer in one word: Beseeching. 1,170 charactersMbpBugeye, Sep 15, 2010

T - Let me start by saying that I love beer, and I love wine, so this is what heaven is like. Upon the first sip, my tastebuds were submerged into a vinous nirvana of sour cherries, and wheat. As I continued, flavors of berries and jam complimented hints of vanilla with a citrus-like zing and some spice.
M/D - This is like the best of both worlds! It has the rich thickness or wine and the carbonation of beer. A little heavy but I would definitely go for another.
This is one of those beers that you run into that just completely changes your appreciation for beer. Out of all the beers I have had, this is my favorite. 792 charactersJef59, Sep 15, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed from my tasting notes of a decent sized sample I consumed at an epic tasting event held with the members of the SMBDC. 
It appeared reddish copper colored, like a glass of sherry. There is a small tan head. I can smell cherries and oak in the nose. When I sip, I first get the taste of a nice fruit juice, then Brett and the other flavors their wild yeasts impart. It has a wine-like finish (tannins gained form the wine barrels perhaps?). The beer has some impressive qualities I usually associate with an oude bruin. It has a great tingly sour feeling. It is pretty drinkable; I don't find it too sour at all, but the physical puckering reaction may be hard for some. 679 charactersToasterChef, Sep 13, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Served from a growler from Sickfkr's kegerator. THANKS, Ken. Have had this in bottles before; finally getting around to raving about it.
Appearance is an off-reddish (?) color with a decent head that fairly quickly dissapates. Very
little lacing on the glass. I'd heard from someone that they had had a flatter than normal bottle; this had just the right amount of low carbonation.
Taste was awesome! Quite sour cherries that I loved. Will definitely seek out more of this in the future. As much as I like Consecration, I'll take Supplication over that nearly every time. 573 charactersSchmittymack, Sep 13, 2010

A- come my way with a small cap of off white head that settles quickly leaving a few spots of lace. A good swirl bring the head right back to its former glory. Orange red in color with a touch of haze. 
S- sour cherries and super funky wood. Mildly herbal and earthy. Vinous at times. 
T- sour and tart with load of some of the funkiest oak I've come across. A clear herbal hit with rosemary and euclypus. The noir barrels lend a lot of vinous and tannic blows. 
M- starts off medium in body but then you pucker and salivate thinning thing out a bit. Nice active carb. Super tannic you can almost feel the wood and grape skins on the roof of your mouth. 
D- this is a bug bomb and I love it. If your looking for a complex and layered sour this is for you. Different then years past. I've noticed a very interesting herbal nuance that has been arising in the rr run. Very cool. 919 charactersoglmcdgl, Sep 11, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5While I've had the priviledge to taste Suppication a number of times over the past two years, I never drank a bottle to myself. I'll cut the dramatic intorduction to a simple "04x4" found on the bottle label. On to the beer:
It's got some really good head retention on top, which for a sour is good to see. Even the lacing sticking to glass is impressive and thickish. Very dark orange in color, looking almost like an aged copper penny. The aroma, oh yes! There are a lot of different routes I could go down; cheesy, vinegar, cherry tart, oak, cantelouple, melon...I should note the final two aromas listed won me over. 
Supplication is sour, but its acidic character is toned down compared to others out there. First hit gets a tart cherry flavor. Then comes some cheese. After that, the flavor profile goes nuts! Melons, canteloupe, and mango are among the fruits I can taste from this wild beer. Sour tones continue to rain. Towards the end of the sip, I'm getting this sensation of critters. Wrap it all up, and you have here an unbelievably complex beer. The mouthfeel isn't shabby at all. It feels meaty but delicate at the same time, errr, call it tender. And while its tasty flavor profile help make consuming the beer more enjoyable, the beer from the start already was very easy to approach for the style. One more thing, before I put in my final words, there's a checkerboard of spotty lacing that continues to stick, and a thickish blanket of head on top of the final ounce I'm about to finish; I guess I'll have to raise the appearance score. 
What else is there to say? Nearly all cylinders of Supplication were clicking to their full potential tonight, and I'm very glad to have finally be given the moment to do an extended trial of this wild exciting beer. If my palate were in 2007 mode, I would have been scratching my head over the hype. Now I get it. There are few beers that can hit all cylinders like Supplication. 1,941 charactersDoubleJ, Sep 10, 2010

Batch 003. A very pretty beer, first pour is clear and then after is a hazy orange/rose color with a small off-white head. Aroma of cherries, sour, spices, pepper and cassis. Taste is very sour at first with a really long tart cherry aftertaste. Slightly sweet in the middle, but the taste does not have nearly as much characters of the Pinot as I was expecting or wanting (compared to the Amazing Grace that I had at Lost Abbey). Light and a bit fizzy. Alcohol is well hidden. 
 Rerate: Batch 3. Pours pretty with a hazy orange body with great lacing and a huge white head that stays. Aroma is awesome with vinous notes, funk, cherries, barrel, sourness and wine. Taste is sour, sour and more sour with cherries, wine and a bit of baby diaper. Fizzy, dry and mouthpuckering. 854 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 10, 2010

It pours with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly, then slows down. It doesn't leave a whole lot of lacing. The beer is a plumb skin/passionfruit skin color with a nice bead of orange.
The smell is sweet but tart. It has a ncie fragrance of sour cherries, but also a sugary sweetness. There is so,e lemon rind coming form the yeast as well. The oak isn't that well-pronounced in the smell.
The flavor is at first of sweet cherries, then then it turns to to a dry, lemony pucker. There is a int of funkiness to it but nothing overpowering. Te cherries really shine here, with both sweet cherry flavor and tartness. The oak lingers in the background, accenting the beer just enough. There is an overall hint of mineral water which makes it lighter, but also a bit more blunt with the flavor delivery. I think it lacks a midground between the subtle sweetness and super sour. 
Overall it is a pretty good sour, perhaps overrated, but great for people who love a ton of sourness. 1,042 characterscrossovert, Sep 10, 2010

A- Pours a lovely cherry-red tinted amber color with tons of off-white head. Head has excellent retention and lacing.
S- Big tart cherry aroma. Sour and funky, with juicy cherry aromas and some wine-like notes.
T- Deliciously sour. Bretty funk, tart cherries, with a puckering sour kick. 
M- Very nice. A little creamy, with light carbonation.
D- Actually very high. Not overpoweringly sour, and is quite refreshing.

4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On Tap @ RR brewery, was too cheap to pay $12/bottle for this at city beer or toronado - huge glass for $5 at Russian River! so good this beer is so worth $12/bottle though!
This is an almost perfect brown sour - aged in pinot noir barrels, and simply incredible...the best sour from russian river IMO, and probably the best American wild ale i've ever had. 
Smell is incredible, super complex, woody, earthy, mineral wine notes, corky, and full of ripe fruit - this thing just exudes complexity. 
taste is a bit like a lighter, less winey version of consecration, less woody, which allows the sour and creamy notes to come out more. its full of bad ass ripe incredible sour fruit, berries, winey, woody, leathery for sure. 
mouthfeel in rich, smooth and creamy - awesome. 
drinkability is 4 cause damn, this thing is intense! tried to drink another and couldn't even have half. 
This is truly one of the best sours on earth, let alone in the USA - Russian River just proves over and over that they are the best brewery in the US! 1,036 charactersbenclimbs, Sep 09, 2010

Smell is nice and pretty much what I expected...cherries, wine, and wood with a health dose of funk. The taste is a perfect copy of the aroma but much more in your face. Big cherry tartness with a smooth wine and wood backbone. Funky and delicious all the way though. Mouthfeel was thin and bubbly. Drinkability was good but the beer is definitely a sipper. 474 charactersrussellaaron69, Sep 07, 2010

Had this again on 2015-06-28 at the brewery on tap. Had this on 2016-07-02 from a 2010 bottle that I've kept cellared since then.  
Notes from the 2010 bottle consumed in 2016-07-02.
It's held up really well.  Plenty of tart cherry mixed with the light malt.  The sourness , oak, funk and wine flavors have mellowed and rounded out.  I don't detect any oxidation.  It's delightfully balanced, refreshing and oh-so flavorful.  I don't know how it could be improved.  I've adjusted my overall rating upward to 4.56 from 4.41 because I'm so impressed.  Fortunately, I was able to acquire three 2015 bottles a few days ago here in Pennsylvania to age and enjoy down the road. 
Original review from 2008
A - Mahogany with a short tan head
S - Could smell it from two feet away. Cherries and what reminded me of the inside of a spring house on a summer day. So inviting.
T - Amazing. Like biting into a sour cherry while swigging apple cider. Sour, acidic, puckering, brilliant although I slightly prefer the Consecration.
M Light-medium body and carbonation.
D - You could savor this until you can't walk straight :>)  (as quoted from my buddy Pat B who accompanied me to the brewery on this day). 1,317 charactersTucquan, Sep 04, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Dark, beautiful, garnet colored beer, like a wine.
S - There's a lot going on here --- I first get a beautiful cherry and pinot quality smell, nearly like a wine. But then there's the citrus sourness present. Throw in some cranberry, perhaps. Maybe I'm crazy, but I also get a faint herb smell. 
T - Wonderful lambic qualities - sourness up front, followed by cherry and citrus. I get less of the wine quality on the tongue, except for maybe a slight tannic quality? Overwhelming tart/sour lingers well after the sip, and I get an almost grassy note the longer I let it sit on the tongue.
M - Slight carbonation balances out the sourness. Pretty light body.
D - This is amazing, with tons of nuanced flavor and smell. I could see it pairing well with a lot of different foods (mussels??) and could stand on its own. Beautiful sour ale. 839 charactersdzni, Sep 04, 2010
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375mL bottle of batch 005x5 (courtesy of the generous IdrinkGas) poured into my Duvel tulip.
The beer pours nearly opaque, inhabiting the space in between burnt orange and brown. The beer quickly has a two finger bone colored crown that cuts itself in half before holding and slowly fading (though never dissipating). The nose is good, but missing some of the elements I would expect from a beer like this. I get tons of funk and tartness from the bacteria, but nothing to speak of really in the way of cherries or oak. Not to worry though as those flavors make themselves known as soon as I sip Supplication. A hint of malty sweetness from the brown ale base, along with the cherries leads off. Oak then makes a brief, but nice appearance, before the beer finishes with the handiwork of the brett and bugs. The body of the beer is nice and light, but I feel like the carbonation could be just a little bit higher. So delicious that it's one of the most drinkable wilds I've ever had, but the tartness lingers just long enough to keep me from scoring a 5. Another fantastic beer churned out by Russian River, and I look forward to seeing what some time does to my second bottle of it. 1,185 charactersaxeman9182, Sep 03, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle, batch 04x5. Pours a clear reddish copper with a medium creamy white head that retains well and laces the glass.
The aroma is a little subdued but very nice - sweet and tart cherries with some wood and a touch of alcohol.
The flavor is a huge punch of sour tart fruits. After getting accustomed to the sourness, some sweet cherries and wood comes out. It has a dry finish with some sharp sour notes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly sharp.
Overall, this is one of the sourest beers I've had and one of the best sours. It's very nice - the sweet cherries help balance the sourness and make it interesting. I picked up very little Brett, more could be interesting. This is even more intense in the bottle than when I had it on draft. A bit of an expensive treat at $13 a bottle. 803 charactersBeaver13, Sep 02, 2010

 One inch fluffy head that slowly sinks into a wispy cap with nice lacing as the level drops
 a clear amber that has some suspended particles and slow stream of small bubbles that rises to the top.
 the aroma is slightly vinegar, I'm not getting any funk, there is a clean apple note the overall impression is bright, clean sour.
 Taste is tart yet creamy, some cherry flavors come on, a slight oakyness is in the creamy part, very complex and satisfying.
 Carbonation is champaign like, refreshing even a little sweetness on the end with a dry finish.

Poured in to my Portsmouth tulip
A: This beer pours a ruddy light brownish/red color with a two finger creamy, khaki colored head. Head recedes at a moderate pace and just coats the glass with creamy sheets of lacing. 
S: Nose is nice and tart - cherry and apple, a bit of funkiness, and a mild vinegar note.
T: Taste starts with a dose of tart cherry, mingled with a bit of funk. Middle has a bit of apple flavoring with a touch of oak and funk. Finish becomes extremely tart and vinegery with a touch of citrus bitterness. 
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, crisp with a bone dry finish.
D: Goes down easily, mild kick, nice representation of style. I am kicking myself for not being in to sours when I was at RR last December - could have had this fresh on tap. I can't wait to have this again! 891 charactersJayli, Sep 02, 2010
4.31/5  rDev -4.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had on tap at Choice City Butcher and Deli in Fort Collins, Colorado. I went in for lunch and a high quality beer. But I didn't expect to see something as revered as Supplication on tap. While Older Viscosity tempted me for a moment, the choice was clear, Supplication would be the beer to accompany my fine lunch. Maybe in a few months, a bourbon barrel stout will be a bit more appetizing. Anyway, the four dollar half pint was poured into a red wine glass. 
A quarter inch, white and fluffy head sat on top of the beautiful golden orange burnt honey color beer, with just the faintest hint of haze. The head didn't stick around too long, receding to a simple ring of suds around the rim of the glass. Little to no lacing was evident, but who cares. This was one of the best looking beers I have had, ever.
The smell of this beer was light and delicate. There were some hints of tart fruits, like apple and cherry, some wild bug funk, as well as a bit oakyness holding everything together. 
Taste was exceptional. The funk and tart dominate the taste, with the fruity and esters hiding in the background, ready to pounce on the back of your pallet. Cherry and apple are the fruits you get, both from the cherries used in the brew, and the esters produced by the bugs. The oakyness, again, helps to hold everything together, and smooth out the tartness of the beer.
The beer has a medium, silky mouthfeel which is held in check by both the tart and the carbonation. The lactic acid and carbon do bite a bit in the back of your throat, but not in a bad way. In the end, this beer was highly drinkable.
Paired with a buffalo, cheddar, bacon, balsamic onion, and red pepper burger on a toasted bun, this beer made for the perfect meal. A bit expensive, yes, but man was it enjoyable. AS a beer advocate, this may be the pinnacle of all beer related experiences. 1,864 charactersmkorpal, Sep 01, 2010

375 ml bottle (Batch 04x4) poured into Allagash chalice. 
A: Pours a clean, thin amber with copper highlights. Very effervescent head that quickly dies down to a ring of film. Leaves some nice lacing on the glass.
S: Very sour in the nose; vinegar and tart cherries. I smell a bit of oak in the back end as well, and even a little citrus. Smells good.
T: From the smell I thought this was going to be overly sour, but thankfully it's quite well balanced. Alcohol, while moderate, is hidden extremely well. Very bright and full of fruit; black cherry is at the forefront, and is so deep and lush that it tastes "fresh." Not sure how else to describe it, but you can tell that there was a lot of thought put into this. Absolutely delicious.
M: Champagne-like in its carbonation, and it works perfectly. This coats the mouth like silk; rare for a sour if you ask me.
D: With its moderate ABV (7%) and well-balanced sourness, this is an extremely drinkable sour as far as I'm concerned. I would rate this up there with Allagash Interlude as one of my favorite sours, and can't wait to try more.
Don't miss this one. 1,168 characterssk8man121, Sep 01, 2010

pop the cork to a nice hiss and release of fog, just like champagne. poured into a goblet carefully to leave behind the yeast sediment. the color is a shiny orange brown, with red highlights. nice thin creamy head, that leaves great lacing all down the glass. smell is of sour cherries, with a little funkiness. taste is extremely tart cherry that puckers the lips, and lingering well into the aftertaste. as it warms, a little oak and vanilla briefly appears amongst the overpowering sour flavor. very little sweetness to balance the vinegar acidic taste. mouthfeel is nice, higher carbonation is bubbly but smooth. 
for the extremely high price, and the unbalanced flavor, can't say this has a very high drinkability. I've tried a few "sours" in the past (ie. Duchesse DeBourgogne and Monk's Cafe Flemish) and enjoyed them, but this one is just too much for my liking. 1,027 charactersjmdrpi, Aug 31, 2010

Pours a thin head, but leaves plenty of lacing down the glass. awesome glow, burnt orange brown. a very pretty beer. smell is great, loads of sour fruits right off the bat, apples taking the lead. a dark malt profile comes out, and some definite sour and sweet cherries (one of the more cherry intensive bottles that i've had). some hints of grainy wood smell. the taste follows and does not disappoint. Huge sour right away, but not punishing. again cherries come out, but definitely not the main flavor over sour. some woody malts come out as the beer sits in my mouth, and as the serving warms these become a little more prevalent. Mouthfeel is phenomenal, carbonation is at a perfect level. leaves my mouth feeling the same kind of clean as a fresh granny smith. drink is nice, this one begs to be drank again and again, though the sourness would probably get tiring after a while (i wish i had enough to find out!)

4.38/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375 mL bottle from batch 04x2, thought it would be fitting for my 1000th review. Pours a crystal clear amber hue with a fluffed, cream colored head. Pretty good retention for a sour and leaves a nice ring or two of lace.
Balanced aroma of cedary wood, funky brettomyces and some light-ish sour notes. Vinous a bit and the pinot barrels are evident as is some cherry notes. Smells better as it warms, and I like the fact that it is not just all sour all the time, there are many subtle nuances on display.
Taste has just about everything one could want in a sour ale; wood, brett, lacto and cherries. It is nice that the sourness stays with you all the way through the bottle rather than the palate adjusting after a few sips like some other sours I have had. Brett presence is deep and rich and actually fights the lacto to a draw, both are heavy hitters. Tart cherries play an integral role as well. Yeast addition softens the flavors some at the end of the bottle and it is a sad moment indeed when the last few drops of a Supplication drain from the lip of the bottle. Fantastic brew! I am not sure I could ever pass up a bottle of this at a beer store. 1,158 characterstwiggamortis420, Aug 29, 2010

375ml bottle, batch 04x3
Pours an amber color with a smallish head, fades fast and leaves no lacing along the glass.
Smell is incredibly tart and sour to the nose, I can tell this is going to be a good one, the oak is quite subtle, the cherries less so, a beautifully aromatic beer.
Taste is an interesting sour, the oak and cherry really play a part to the acidic tartness, carbonation is very lively and maybe a bit too aggressive, the sour kick lingers long after and makes your mouth a bit sticky from trying to recover.
Another excellent wild ale from RR, easily one of the best breweries in America doing the style. 696 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Aug 28, 2010

Appearance -- Pours ruddy amber with just enough haze to catch light and two fingers of creamy white head. No lacing as much as frosting hte glass with head. Beautiful.
Smell -- Mild funk and cider vinegar, cherries, pinot, Granny Smith, pear, faint vanilla oakiness. Overall: very delicate and balanced. Love the way this smells.
Taste -- More tartness than the nose would let on. Bright cherry tartness, mild cider vinegar bite, amber malt, some wine character, and bretty funk. Dab of vanilla in the finish. Nothing is overpowering. Everything is gently layered upon one another. Great stuff.
Mouthfeel -- Medium in body with abundant fluffy carbonation. Almost velvety in the finish. Mild astringency from the barrels, but not at all distracting. Very pleasant.
Drinkability -- Given easy availability and no lambic-stomach, I could drink this regularly. A rare treat that I enjoyed to the fullest. 918 charactersyeahnatenelson, Aug 23, 2010

Wow, much more sour than Consecration and I don't even need to taste it to tell, I can smell it! Sour fruit on the nose. Cherry, peach, and apricot. 
The sour acids make my mouth water and pucker my tongue. In fact, you don't even taste it as first. The only sensory experience is the perception of sourness. But after my mouth finally adjusts, I learn there is more going on. Sour cherries, crisp green apple, shock tarts, cider vinegar, some sweet candy character, and oak. Wood tannin is perceptible on the tongue. Still, in Supplication sourness plays the lead role and the audacity of this sourness overshadows some of the other flavors. When a beer is produced with such care, when it is aged for over a year in used Pinot Noir barrels, it develops a great deal of sophistication and nuance. Unfortunately, Supplication is so sour, I am unable to detect let alone appreciate these developments.
A great beer, but the sourness in this batch seems to go too far. I enjoyed previous batches far more than this one.
Batch 003x1
Didn't review this, enjoyed with the wife on December 31st, 2010, our last New Year's in Denver. It was given to us on our wedding night in October of 2008. This one was a MUCH better experience than a fresh batch 5. Sourness was a little less aggressive, more secondary flavors showing through. One of the best beers we have had. My ratings above do not reflect this bottle as I did not take notes, but it would have been in the 4.5-4.7 area. 1,490 charactersBradLikesBrew, Aug 23, 2010

strawberry reddish in color lots of floaties and tons of effervesence. White fluffy 2 finger head with very small tight bubbles. Very nice looking beer. 
I definity get the wine barrel characteristics. Lots of oak,sour cherries and a touch of vinegar with some funk and some floral. 
Right away I get the tart cherries. Very acidic but balanced with a ton of depth for being so sour. 
Nice tangy acidic mouthfeel. Smooth light bodied and so very easy to drink 
no doubt about it. This is one of the best beers I've ever crossed paths with. Simply amazing!

Pours a beautiful deep ruby red with a finger of soft cream colored head that has great retention and great lacing. Smells of wood, red grapes, some spice, cherries, and definitely a funky brett smell. Taste is much like the nose but now I can pick up on raspberries and the vinegar cuts through, in a very pleasant way. The sourness is mouthwatering and refreshing, not burning or overly drying. Nice and sweet but nicely sour too, ends pretty cleanly but still has a faint lingering grain taste, but more noticeable in the slight aftertaste are the sour cherries. Wonderful carbonation and coating round out the dry and tart body. Incredibly delicious and enjoyable, though I could see how having much more would be troublesome for a person's stomach or tongue. Still, this is an incredible beer and I wish that RR distributed in MA! 877 characterskbanks13, Aug 21, 2010

S - Sour cherry and oak are the first major impressions. As it warms I get more sweet cherry and other fruits, and vanilla from the wood, as well as some fruity brett notes.
T - Taste is tart and sour cherry, mixed with sharp oak. Less overt sweetness and more wine character. This is a rare case where a touch more malt character would have made things better. Closer to 4.25 than a true 4.5 for me.
M - Initially sticky medium body, that finishes dry and tannic, and with no heat.
D - This is a classic Russian River sour. I could drink this regularly with little complaint other than the holes in my stomach. A must-try for all lovers of things sour. 864 charactersMasterSki, Aug 19, 2010

A - A brilliant, but hazy deep amber that has a small off-white head that has excellent retention and intricate lacing coating the glass from top to bottom.
S - Sour cherries dominant with red wine and oak balancing it out, also has some of that Belgian funk.
T - Red wine flavors roll into yeasty funkiness then oak and sour cherries.
M - Medium body, high carbonation, smooth across the palate, and the finish leaves some stickiness coating the mouth.
D - Wow, I drank this fairly quickly. Sourness is apparent, but in no way overpowering. I'm going to have to try and savor my next bottle. Everything in this beer just seems to work so well. Maybe I drank it too cold, because I could not find as much complexity as others have in the nose or taste, or else I would have scored it a bit higher in those categories. 830 charactersgaruda, Aug 18, 2010

Nice light amber and orange with hints of ruby. Light head with little to no retention.
Tons of cherry and a sourness. Nice light brown ale scents. Light oak.
Again, tons of cherry up front. The sourness blended well with the cherry to dominate this ale. Light oak through out with subtle hints of vanilla and dark fruit.
Nice medium body and moderate carbonation. Dry through out and in the finish. 
This is one of my all time favorite beers. The tap version blew my mind, so much flavor. I am assuming I had batch 5 which is the latest batch.
Well done! This is world class. 595 charactershooliganlife, Aug 17, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Got this courtesy of a trade with Cheezdawg, much thanks. 
Poured from a bottle into a tulip. It pours a nice copper/brown. A 1/2 inch off-white head forms, leaving a nice full coverage lacing. Carbonation is visible and there is some sediment.
The aroma is very good with some dark fruit with cherry sweet blended with a strong acidity and some oaky components.
The taste is definitely sour, as expected. The cherry and oak components sneak through with a little time on the tongue. There is an additional fruity component.
The mouthfeel is light bodied with a champagne-like carbonation. A definite sour pucker and dryness lingers with some burn in the back of my throat. Complex and unique.
Overall, I can drink this beer and enjoy every ounce of it, however, I don't think I could have more than one, as I don't know how much mouth I would have left. 859 charactersSykDoc, Aug 17, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured into a dessert wine glass at the Toronado. I wasn't prepared for how good this was. I way underestimated Russian River.
Appearance - Reddish brown with a pure white head. The visible effervescence is alluring.
Smell - Wow, that's complex. I knew it was made with cherries, but the nose is mostly funk. The wild yeast is the predominant characteristic. The wood aging also hits the aroma some, I'm thinking french oak. And yes, the detectable fruit characteristics are subtle but all cherry. Think earthy gouda cheese or moldy bleu also and I mean that in a good way. Hard to get my nose out of here for the first sip.
Taste - Nice and sour on the front but in a mild and approachable way. It lingers a bit and loving sours like I do it was one beautiful thing. The cherry flavor is also subtle, it doesn't overwhelm anything. There's also apple here, and apricot. There's a slight vinegar that balances some of the cherry notes. There are also some funky notes that taste somehow earthy.
Mouthfeel - Light bodied, and bubbly. Silky, too.
Drinkability - I could have gone back and ordered only glass after glass of this beer and never get tired of it. The next night I went back to the same bar and ordered one of these again as soon as I got there, and almost ordered another right away, but wanted to try other beers I can't get in Chicago.
Notes: Very easily became my favorite sour beer in the U.S. I was charmed immediately. It's the best thing this brewery does out of the four or five I had of theirs. 1,520 charactersphilosobeer, Aug 16, 2010

Initial smell is sour and funky, with hints of cherry. On first sip, punched with SOUR (mouth puckers) which is followed by notes of tart cherry and hints of the oak aging. After a few more sips, the initial cherry smell is undetectable, taken over by smells of a fresh horse stable (in a good way). Very crisp and refreshing. 
This is a tart, mouth puckering beer that coats the palate. A 375ml is the perfect quantity. Probably couldn't run this one all night (unless you really hate your stomach). All-in-all, a really wonderful sour. 717 charactersgreggerino, Aug 13, 2010

The nose isn't particular intense. Sour, brett, funky, cherries. The taste mimics the nose completely. Cherries, brett and funk. It's more tart than sour, in my opinion. But maybe it's because my bottle was too young (Batch 5). Mouthfeel was appropriate - light, good carbonation.
In general, this didn't meet the hype for me. It's a good wild/sour to be sure, but it just didn't blow me away. Perhaps this thing really develops with age, and if so, then I might be willing to try an older bottle - but I doubt I'd trade for it...someone would have to shoot me a bottle out of their generosity. I'm just too doubtful that this brew can age into something that'd be worth trading for, given the decent price it commands.
All in all, not a bad beer at all - in fact, it's quite good. But it's not one of the 25 best beers in the world, IMO. 1,017 charactersMavajo, Aug 13, 2010

This is Batch 04×4. 
A: This bottle opened with a champagne like "pop". It poured a reddish light brown with a small fluffy head on my slow pour to avoid any yeast in my 1st fill of the glass.
S: The nose was slightly funky with some sour cherries. 
T: The taste was well... amazing. You first get hit with a mild puckering tartness followed with delicious sour cherries, and then I picked up some oak and maybe a tad of the pinot. As for the Brown Ale, well I couldn't tell what the base beer was if I wasn't told. 
M & D: This beer is extremely refreshing for a tart/sour beer and the mouth feel was well... mixed with a tongue twisting tartness and had a massaging action from the medium level of carbonation. 
I am a huge fan of Lambics, Gueuze and Wild Ales and Supplication is, if not the top, very close to the top of my list of all time favorites in those styles. This brew should age very well over the next 3-5 years, so I'm glad I have a few more bottles. 1,086 charactersuturn, Aug 10, 2010

A- Fuzzy off white head thats about half an inch thick and sinking, coating a tequila sunrise with effervescent goodness wreathing around to the top.
S-musty peachiness, cherry, cracked lemon pepper, and a tad of malt come through, but this nose sticks with you from pour to bottles up. 
T- Tart and acidic up front, followed by climbing multitudes of creamy body, and an under ripe cherry flavor, finishing in a dry smack. 
M-Sturdy, but on the medium side, and has an amazingly dry and refreshing finish.
D- you can't taste the 7% abv, and its surprisingly easy drinker of a sour. Can't beat that. 848 charactersslayer3604, Aug 10, 2010

A really exceptional beer as I have come to expect from Russian River, especially their wild ales. 
The appearance is a dark and slightly hazy honey-amber without much lasting head. 
It smells of pear and apples when first poured, and once the carbonation calms down a little, then the sour cherries emerge. 
The taste has a bright acidic quality from the sourness, but also a sweet earthy balance from the pinot noir oak barrels. 
The mouthfeel is very good, although not quite as spectacular as some of RR other brews. The carbonation isn't harsh, but it's not as soft and fuzzy as say their Pliny. Still excellent though.
Very drinkable beer despite having a wet finish of lingering pinot noir and cherries. 
A very satisfying beer that has both the bright acidity of Temptation and the sweet complexity of Consecration. Liquid awesomeness. 862 characterswd40, Aug 10, 2010

Big thanks to Hophead101 and the Blind Beers BIF for this beastly extra!
Popped this brew to celebrate my buddy's engagement tonight. Congrats, Alex and Kristin! This bad boy pours a hazy auburn amber topped by over a finger of steadfast white-ish foam. The nose is up front about its bretty sourness, feeling it better to be open with us than try to hide its true feelings. I can respect that. Some tart berries, oak, light vanilla bean, and caramel corn occasionally bubble to the surface as well, but it's always the bretty-ness that looms over them all, all cocky and whatnot. The taste follows this template, with the sourness rocking my tongue fore to aft without much mercy. The brute. The berries return, along with some decidedly sour cherries, some oak, and a touch of butter somewhere behind the wall of bretty fog. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and an almost sticky feel. Overall, a more-than-solid wild child, though I'm not sure how often I could indulge in this treat. 1,041 charactersTMoney2591, Aug 03, 2010

Nose is fresh. Antiseptic, vinegar, apples and cherries are present.
Taste is very tart with sweetness in back ground. Cherries and apples with a little yeast flavor.

4.12/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Forewarning: my review is going to fall off the grid. 
First, for the standard analysis: this beer fares well on all criteria, pours a lovely dark brown into my Duvel chalice, good head. Nice, complex aroma with cherry, wine overtones. Lovely taste, complex tartness, this beer tracks its strong Belgian heritage and then adds something. This is, of course, something to be savored to the full--a dessert beer, really.
My objection to this beer is simple and straightforward. I love both wine and beer, but this one toes the line uncomfortably close to wine territory in my view. The dominant flavors here are, plainly, largely from being aged in wine barrels (one can pick that out immediately). As my review above states, this is a fine tasting beer and I'd gladly have it again but bluntly if this is the flavor I am craving, I'd rather have a nice glass of Rioja or Cotes du Rhone than this (which, by the way, is equally if not more costly). 948 charactersappenzeller, Jul 25, 2010

Pours a nice cloudy orange/amber color. Decent amount of head that lingers and leaves spotty lacing around the glass.
Aroma is excellent. Strong waves of super tart cherry overpower everything - this effect is even more prevalent once you take a taste. Very lush and bubbly, it feels nice swishing around your mouth with each sip. The super tart nature of this makes it hard for me to drink alot of, but it is excellent nonetheless.
Not a big fan of sours or wild ales, but I would definitely drink this again if I get the chance. 598 charactersthetomG, Jul 24, 2010

Light aroma, smells great and inticing, like hay that sat in the barn a few wet seasons with a leaky roof, there is a light fruity aspect also.
Bottle says cherries are added and that is there but there is also a darker taste possibly from the malt, like currants maybe, just some darker fruits and funky brett character melded together, not the most sour beer i've tried from Russian River but very up front nontheless, has that spring grassy field character i really enjoy.
It's a sour ale, so yo know it's dry and puckering, not the most sour but enough to satisfy and make you desire it on a hot day. 708 charactersChadQuest, Jul 21, 2010
3.68/5  rDev -18.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reverence and respect to msubulldog25 for including this in our most recent trade! (Batch 04X2, whatever that means)
I opened this a mere two hours after receiving the trade box, which made a cross country journey. Something seemed fishy about the cork, like it was going to pop any second. I got 5 twists into the wire cage, and POP!!!, the cork hit my ceiling like a cannonball and I made sure to get this thing into the glass with a quickness. Pours a rusted light brown color, nearing a peach shade. The head is made of incredibly small bubbles, and though it's not thick, it stays a long while and leaves lots of lace. 
I don't know much about wine, but my first smell communicates "white wine." I later looked on the label's fine print and found this was aged in pinot noir barrels. There you have it. Wood gives way to white grape, and there's the distinctively weird/funky/stinky essence of the bad boys of the yeast world here (Brett, Lactobacillus, etc.).
I like funk, and this one brings a nice bit of saddle blanket sweat into the mix. There's also the extremely tart essence of too-young green apple, too-young white grape, and green/white gooseberry. Super-tart, hell, even full-on sour, this leaves the mouth puckered and dry. The "cherries added" are here, but only in their tartness, lacking the sweeter, juicier essence I think of when I think "cherry."
Crisp but smooth, and extremely dry, any real textural impression is left in the dust once the mouth puckers and all the alarms ring "sour! sour! sour!"
Not my favorite sort of thing, especially with the intense tartness, but there's no question how well this is made. I wouldn't reach for it often even if I could, but for lovers of this sort of beer it's got to be total nirvana. I'll rate the drinkability a "4" as a more objective judgment than I'd normally do. Personally, I'm super-glad to have tried it (thanks Brian!), but still kind of circling around most sours as a merely intrigued novice. 1,978 charactersMetalmonk, Jul 21, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Firstly, I'll disclose I'm not a fan of sours, I don't care for wine and if there is too much lip puckering involved, I simply won't drink it. That being said, with this brew I was still able to appreciate a fine and balanced treat.
Beer pours jack o lantern orange, and supplies a decent head with exceptional lacing. Very pretty.
Smell is dry and sour, I can't really pick up on the cherries or any other obvious fruits or scents at this point. Though I can smell a fruitiness, almost like a wine.
Because I'm not a particular fan of this style I can't rate it definitively. However I have had sours before and my GOD, this blows the others away. The beer just simply tastes balanced, there isn't too much or little of anything, the sourness is strong but restrained and the fruitiness is a nice touch. There is a rare complexity to it as well that leaves me ponderous yet intrigued. It is dry and there is a woody texture as well. The cherries don't really come into the play until the aftertaste, as my breath smelt like cherries after. Very solid, I need to get into this style more.
Mouthfeel has a good texture, thick and dry. Lots of carbonation. Perhaps even too much? I let this sit for a while, and after it warmed up and lost its bite it tasted much much much better to me.
Drinkability is good, I could drink a few of these no problem, and one 375ml will leave you wanting more, trust me.
As said before, I really need to mess around with this style a bit more. 1,480 characterscoalclear, Jul 16, 2010

A - This brew has almost everything I look for in the style. Very nice ruby hue, translucent, not so much lace, but wild/sour seldom does etc.
S - This brew has almost everything I look for in the style. And as palatable and easily appreciable as any that comes to mind.great tartness, barrel and cherry; sublime, not overly pungent
T - This brew has almost everything I look for in the style. Great cherry flavor. Like a drier version of Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek, like as if it were made by Cantillon. Shows some notes of the wood char-sulfur that I find in the finest Gueuze.
M - This brew has almost everything I look for in the style. Tart, refreshing, medium bodied, nearly perfect carbonation.
D - This brew has almost everything I look for in the style. Just phenomenal. It is a beer like this that makes a brewery world-famous. 1,072 charactersktrillionaire, Jul 13, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Russian River's Belgian style beers all are aptly named after different stages of religious conversion. Their Supplication, a sour brown ale "aged in French oak Pinot Noir barrels" is an example of craft brewing at its finest. A ménage à trois of brettanomyces yeast and lactobacillus and pediococcus bacteria (as well as an addition of sour cherries to the barrel) all contribute to an incredibly complex melange of tart flavors. 
Supplication pours the honey color of an aged port producing minimal head with some lacing. Its nose hints of champagne and the delicate carbonation extends the comparison, until ... the first sip of hits your mouth and intense flavors flood your palate--the sourness running around to tantalize the glands in your neck. With another taste, the high cherry notes ring out and are balanced by a wonderfully mellow oak finish at the back of the mouth. I wish I could walk around with that taste every day. 
After letting it breathe and adding a little more of the yeasty goodness, Supplication becomes even more complex with more high notes and incredible mouth sizzle; adding in the lees really takes the sour cherry down a peg without losing the oak-fueled finish. 1,200 charactersmonkeylovebeer, Jul 13, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A wonderful beer I had on tap at Local 44 during beer week. This was the last beer we had in our session and I'm glad because not much really stands up to the acidity and flavor of this beer. It has beautiful bouquet with fresh cherry and grape notes with toasted oak, barnyard and sharp acid. The taste was very much wine like with an interesting combination of both fresh and aged character, there was low apparent bitterness that seemed to get lost in the tartness, but that was enough to just provide balance.. The grape and cherry fruit flavors dominate this beer, with the bret and wild character providing a background of interest. This was a great beer to share because at 10 oz, I think this is the most I could drink before I would no longer be able to taste the different individual flavors and my palate was shot. 825 charactersSoonami, Jul 11, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Opened one of my bottles from batch 04X3. Pours a ruddy dark brown with a 1/2 inch pale head in an Allagash chalice. Head laces beautifully while sipping, and stays for a good 20 minutes while drinking. 
Smells like sour cherries, with good reason, with a decent amount of oak and malt. I do not notice a strong funk to the beer, but I started sipping at 40°F. 
Not quite as sour as some other wild yeast ales I've tried in the past. The brown ale base is a good match with the sour cherry and barrel aging, picking up a slight tartness while also rounding out sweetness of a brown ale by marrying it with the tannins. 
Swishing the beer around in my mouth, it is a surprisingly crisp beer. There is little aftertaste, but a pleasant aroma can still be detected by nose minutes after drinking it. 
At 7.0% abv, the beer is very drinkable, especially with how quickly the sourness dissipates in your mouth, leaving you with the slight scent of cherry and malt to encourage you to take another sip. 1,001 charactersnataku00, Jul 11, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 005x2 375ml bottle
Appearance: mahogany brown, thin persistent head, steady stream of bubbles
Smell: Burgundian cherry/raspberry and oak mixed with some hints of funk and sourness. I think some of the Pinot Noir barrels come through. The smell is a bit faint when cold, with more presence as the beer warms up.
Taste: Cherries, red Burgundy, oak (vanilla, spice), sour/malty sweet balance finishing sour. A bit of tobacco/currant. The finish lingers for a while, a sour funkiness. The balance on this beer is impressive. The sourness is noticeable, but doesn't dominate the flavor.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, finishes fairly dry. 
Drinkability: With the sourness and dry finish, it is easy to drink. Each finish begs the next sip, until the bottle is gone. 764 characterszigpenguin, Jul 10, 2010

A: Pours a bubbly amber with a thin white head that had great retention and left a sticky sheet of lace down the glass. A few flecks of yeast made it out with the pour. 
S: Smells of sweet cherry with a touch of sour tartness and musty wood funk. I also pick up notes of plum skin, lemon juice and Brett. 
T: Taste follows the nose with sour cherries and enough tartness to get my mouth to water, but not overwhelmingly so. There is a light malt and red wine flavor all the way through, and touch of sweetness and tannin in the finish. Aftertaste is vinous and has a slight cheesy funk. 
M: Acid nips at the tongue in the dry finish. This beer is well carbonated, fizzy but soft. Body is medium, but the mouthfeel is a tad rough around the edges. 
D: This most definitely lives up to its reputation. Crazy, complex and delicious. 865 charactersscottfrie, Jul 09, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appears a light brown/amber color with a fairly thick white head.
Smells like tart cherries there is also a sweet floral aroma. A damp wood smell and citrus smell is noticeable. The smell is very complex and is loaded with some many different smells it hard to note them all.
Tastes at first of tart cherries with a tad bit of a lemon rind taste. It progresses to a wood like flavor and a bit of cherry sweetness. There are musty and funky overtones. There are a lot of complex flavors mingling in this. It is very sour but has other flavors present as well.
Often times I find sour ales to be one dimensional but this ale has a lot of stuff going on. This is the best sour I have had. The carbonation is moderate low and light.
This is a really easy beer to drink and is flavorful but it did wreck my palate. This is deserving of the hype it has. 851 characterschumba526, Jul 05, 2010

Huge thank you to tturaiders for the chance to try this!
A: Moderate pop w/ some wispy "smoke." Relatively clear, pinkish copper hue. Firm, sturdy head looks like it could last all day. Even as I near the final third of this beer there is a solid finger of head. Very attractive.
S: Tart cherries jump out of the glass. Nice, citrusy funk. Smells like a hazy summer day amidst the wilderness: tall grass, wildflowers, foliage, berries, and pollen filled air.
T: Very flavorful. The kind of beer that just bursts over the palate leaving you wanting nothing else but another sip. Mildly sweet up front. Tart cherries and wildberries drizzled with fresh lemon juice. Sour and funky, but very approachable. Finishes with just a little pucker.
M: Just about perfect. The kind of feel that can only come from a bottle conditioned beer. 
D: I wish I had another bottle!
I certainly had high expectations for this one and it didn't disappoint. I'm not an expert on sour/wild ales, but I can't imagine there are many better than this on the landscape of American made wild ales. Find one of these and drink it as soon as you can. 1,177 charactersAdamGarcia, Jul 05, 2010

The smell is like a good wine. The cherries are right up front with a wine barrel smell that overpowers most everything else. Slight malts and hops but barely noticable.
Wow, this is an amazing Sour Wild Ale. Cherries, wine barrel, sweet, light malts and a slight taste of earthy hops. Very smooth and not overbearing. A great sour for anybody. Wow one more time.
For a sour this has great drinkability. I could easily grab another. THANK YOU RUSSIAN RIVER, and keep up the quality on your amazing beers. 638 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, Jul 04, 2010

I'm re-reviewing this one because I feel that my initial review was done too early in my BA days, prior to tasting any other sours, and prior to having a more refined palate. 
Dark copper, reddish brown with a persistent haziness. Supplication pours with a one and a half finger head that quickly fades to a thin film that remains for the rest of the drink. Sour cherries, musty wood, vines, slight malts, dark chocolate, raspberries, and booze. Sour cherries and ripe lemons up front followed by a funky mustiness and some alcohol heat. The aftertaste is rich in bread, sweet cherries, a touch of cinnamon, and a lingering sour must. A drinkable beer. 731 charactersairohead2001, Jul 03, 2010
4.51/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked up this bottle at the Younger release. I've been taking good care of it, waiting for the right moment to crack it open. Yesterday happened to be that right moment. Reviewed from notes.
A small head shows beige over amber and tanned hues. Aromas are sour and acidic. They're undeniably fruity, but I am not confident that it's quite "cherry". But a pull from my glass tells another story. The flavors are hugely sour, a massive wop of cherries explodes in my mouth, tingles, tickles, and makes me pucker. The cherries are really sublime, though the oak offers an earthiness that does well to balance it out enough that I don't want to call this a lambic. As I sip, I notice the froth is retaining and lacing the glass ... which is always something I like to take note of. Vinous and flavorful, this ale isn't too highly carbonated and has a light to medium mouthfeel. I love a good sour, and this one is done wonderfully. I can't wait to try future batches! 964 characterswashburnkid, Jul 01, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a slightly turbid mahogany topped by a healthy, lumpy head that retains nicely and laces beautifully.
The aroma is black, bruised cherries and saddle leather, white wine, slight lemony acidity, with some green apple and unripe peaches.
The taste is acerbic bing cherries all the way with a hint of pepper, barnyard and a nice, clean, dry okay finish. Tart and crisp. Sour like a lambic, but lighter and brighter on the palate with some aged hop presence as well. Very vinous. Borderline vinegary.
Really, this is an engaging beer that really draws me in and makes me want to never stop drinking it. It feels simple and complex at the same time.
Very easy drinking and definitely a beer made for pairing with food. 723 charactersMeisterBurger, Jun 30, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter on 6/20/10
Batch 04X5
Dark tobacco-burst brown; lighter around the edges & dense in the middle. Highlights of ruby if the light catches it a certain way. An ample amount of billowy foam rose to over two fingers. Over time it has been reduced to an island of bubbles amid a skim. Very impressive clinging lace. 
Tart & sour cherries are strong in the nose. Without agitation, the aroma is faintly funky but not overly so. Swirling changes that, opening up to reveal hints of wet hay, lactic acid & a bit of barnyard funk. A pervasive wooden mustiness further calls to mind a deteriorating barn.
Extremely sharp & sour cherries are immediately apparent; they're also unrelenting. Right after the initial shock of the cherries, swaths of lactic acid move in, offering an interesting (if not obscure) counterpoint. A little brett-induced funk manifests around the middle, becoming more pronounced with warmth. Undertones of oak & pinot noir creep in toward the finish. It's a bit spicy & very, very dry.
Medium-full bodied. Carbonation seems pretty appropriate. The taste is to incredibly sharp it makes the carbonation seem more vigorous than it really is. Sourness & lactic residuals linger on the finish with a some dry spiciness. 
Supplication is most impressive in that the extreme tartness doesn't subside over time. I've been trying to treat it as a sipper, but it keeps drawing me in; I fear I've gone through it too quickly. This is a fine beer; I'd love to give it another consideration 1,520 charactersRyan011235, Jun 30, 2010

A- Pours a light copper with a slight haze to it. A small head, less than half a finger worth of head. leaves good lacing on the side of the glass.
S- Very tart on the nose. Sour cherries and a healthy dose of wood, probably oak. Maybe some grapes and some yeast.
T- The sour doesn't disappoint. Very sour cherries and little malt presence. Maybe some grapes as well. A nice amount of oak in there and just the slightest bit of brett.
M- Very dry finish and makes your mouth pucker from the sourness. A little bit of sweetness but not overly so. Light bodied with good spritsy carbonation.
D- I can see why this beer comes in a 375. It is the perfect amount of this beer. A sipper for sure but leaves me wanting it again. RR has yet to disappoint me. 857 charactersWisconsinality, Jun 26, 2010

M: light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a sweet sour and slight dry finish. Very nice

4.39/5  rDev -2.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5On draft at the excellent Rose & Crown in Palo.
A - Hazy pinkish-orange, with a two-finger head that doesn't last too long. Thin cap and generous lacing on the glass as it goes down.
S - Cherries dominate the nose, not sweet but very sour. At first there is a bit of funk around the edges, then the sour cherries come right up the middle. I had my nose in the glass most of the night.
T - The cherries are much more subtle than I would've thought from the aroma. They linger in the background, you know they're there but they never really step into the spotlight. Sourness is the king of the ring here. Not just cherries but apple cider and maybe a little bubblegum and brown sugar around the edges. No alcohol that I can detect.
M - Pretty light, which works well with the other characteristics of this beer. Substantial but also dancing across the tongue. 
D - A mixed bag... As much as I love this beer, the sourness just gets to me after a while and I need a change of pace. But I keep coming back to it. 
O - I sampled six beers last night, and this is the only one I had several of. And next time I go back I'll certainly have more -- hell, it'll be the reason I go back. 1,183 charactersdjmichaelk, Jun 21, 2010

Supplication pours a great color copper to red with orange around the edges. Nice white head with tight carbonation. Crazy fine spotted lacing all over the glass. Aroma is of musty basement and damp earthy oak first and then more of a barrel oak aroma followed by the presence of cherries. This beer has a great malty profile which is accented by masterful barrel aging. The flavor from the oak aging frames the cherry flavor very well, not in the way a kriek tastes but in the unique american style. As this beer breaths it becomes a bit more sour and leaves your palate cleanly and dryly. Supplication has great mouthfeel, perfect bottle conditioning. This beer is all about balance. The RR guys are amazing, everything you would want to taste, cherry, oak, wild yeast etc. is there and not one aspect overwhelms the others. Well Done! 931 characterspmlondrigan, Jun 21, 2010

Appearance: Poured with a two finger, hazy head. Beer had a nice light and refreshing amber-brown color. Looks very light. Agitation brings the head back into glory after settling. 
Smell: YUM!! Sour cherries and a feint background of sweet malt. Lots of cherries and notes of guava dancing in the corners. 
Taste: Sour, crisp, cherries, cherries and more sour. Really balanced and tasty. The sourness is on point, not overwhelming or boring. Perks up my taste buds and makes me want more.
Mouthfeel: Light, sharp and bubbly. Better effervescence than any lambic or champagne I have ever had. Lights the mouth up and is very, very rewarding.
Drinkability: Do you have some? I'll drink it. I'll drink it all day and all night. I would drink it in a box, I would drink it with a fox, I would drink it in a house, I would drink it with a mouse. I love it and despite the alcohol (which is hidden well) I could crush this daily and never get bored. 981 charactersjf60657, Jun 18, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It pours a hazy amber brown with a fat finger of creamy light tan head. Tongues of lacing lick the inside of the glass. 
In the aroma, the yeast is a force, with a barnyard straw element that yields...well, funk. Lemony tart grain, Bretty sourness, and leather keeps things down to earth. 
Upon sipping, a tangy grain flavor is sweet and bolstered by molasses. Sour lemon and pie cherries snug up through the center, along with wet oak and a hint of vanilla. A touch of vinous grapes join with a broader and more vague overall fruitiness as a light blush of alcohol warms the palate. The sourness is countermanded by an equal residual sweetness that leads to a puckering, peppery finish, complete with a gritty crispness and even a hint of coconut. This is simply a tremendous yeasty display of sweet and sour dueling with the best parts of earth and its grains. 
Medium bodied, it has a lithe creaminess that intrigues as the glowing dryness puckers the mouth for some time indeed. 
No, it is not the beer for every drinker, but if this is what you crave, then it will give up its bounty with glee and make you among the happiest imbibers out there. It's balanced on a knife's edge between the sweet and the sour, with the earthy goodness that damp, fertile soil of a barnyard will provide you. It has a manageable ABV, and it drinks as though it were devoid of anything that would caution you to have a care. Not only do I appreciate the style, I appreciate everything it entails. It's beers like this that make it oh so easy to do exactly that. 1,551 charactersFoxman, Jun 17, 2010

Bottle split and poured into my tulip the beer is a murky amber orange. A tiny wisp of head attempts to form but fails leaving soapy spots around the glass.
The aroma starts with a heavy dose of yeasty sour funk. Tart cherries and granny smith apples along with a solid wet wood and straw mix. No wet dog or horse blanket just fruity sour funk. 
The flavor is super pleasant sour cherries and grapes. Not all up in your face funky but just enough to make you mouth pucker. Light tones of wood and bready yeast sneak in there to add to the complexity of this beers flavor.
Medium to light wine like body with plenty of carbonation.
Overall I wish I had a 375ml to myself. Who am I kidding I wish it was a growler. A perfect balance of sour and sweet to keep you wanting another sip. A simply spectacular beer. 869 charactersbeerwolf77, Jun 17, 2010

Huge thanks to Todd for bringing the Supplication to our Russian River tasting!
A - The distribution of such a small bottle is though between 4 guys but we made it work and it still looks good. Hazy, muddy brown beer is coated by a thin but lingering off-white cream head. Lots of lace covers the glass.
S - The wild funky nose is nearly orgasmic with a bold sour punch that floods the nostrils with a fruity, ester background and a damp wood funk. Not a whole lot of what I would expect as far as wild, barnyard smells, but the aroma is simply amazing. I can't stop taking huge breaths from the glass!
T - Strong sour funk blasts the palate instantly. Damp wood and horse blanket appear more in the flavor than the nose. The tartness of the cherries comes through but not the fruitiness that appears in the nose. This is one perfect wild!
M - The super-sour blast is almost palate-demolishing with a nice tart, medium-light-bodied finish. The mouthfeel is pretty dang nice going down.
D - The 375 ml bottle is more than enough for any one person I would imagine but the beer still causes mouthwatering just thinking about it between each sip. So delicious despite the heavy flavor and feel on the tongue. 1,304 charactersBeerFMAndy, Jun 16, 2010
4.02/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5About half a finger of light tan to off-white foam spreads across the surface, of a fairly loose knit, all tiny bubbles, goes quickly but easily regained with a swirl or two, average lacing. The liquid is noticeably clear, an orange tinged brown, some loss of hue around the rims, plenty of active bubbles visible within. The sour cherry scents explode in your nostrils, evoke cranberry and pomegranate as well, sour lemons but golden honey too, horsehide, lees, drying chunks of rye bread and oats, rosemary and other garden herbs, with all of the barnyard floor and animality, the pureness of the cherry outlasts all the rest. Medium-bodied with a very strong foaminess, this almost necessary to help you palate acclimate to the unrelenting sourness of the cherry fruit. Yeast, lees, tar and a Sherry-like nuttiness fill in many of the open spaces. Very dry, one of the drier beers consumed in memory. As mouth yields to it, more raspberry, nectarine and lemon zest flavors appear. Hard to track any change as it warms, so pervasive is the sourness. A great "experience" brew but not one I'm jonesing to try again any time soon. 1,130 charactersfarrago, Jun 14, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours dark ruby red with a quickly dissipating head. No lace and like a red wine leaves a gentle coating on the glass.
Smell: Cherries and grapes gone wild. The classic barnyard funk surrounds a very fruity concoction of delicious sour cherry and hints of that vinous red grape that is buried under the cherry.
Taste: Big blast of fruit and sourness. Although powerful, the tartness doesn't overpower this beer at all. The beer develops as you drink it from straight up cherry sourness to a funky undercurrent of fresh red grapes and berries. Overall this beer is so complex just like its sister consecration. I feel like I need a PhD to wrap my head around it. No real hints on the high alcohol content.
Mouthfeel: Bouncy on the tongue from the high carbonation, but overall fairly viscous and smooth. Body is about medium to heavy.
Drinkability: This beer is truely great stuff, while it's hard to really put this stuff down to quickly...It's not hard to finish a glass or two. Like I said about consecration, this is a special occasion type of brew. 1,068 charactersBigIrishman, Jun 14, 2010

(A)- Pours a cloudy orange-ish mahogany color that produced a good fluffy eggshell colored head that stuck around for a awhile. Left some lacing behind as it dissipated, but really never completely. Still had some foam with the last few sips.
(S)- Crisp, yet tart smelling dark fruits with a lively dry oak and funk. Not necessarily a strong barnyard funk, but a dry yeasty/hay/straw/earthy profile to it. Goes so great with the oak spiciness and fruits. 
(T)- Pretty much just like the smell. Awesome tart fruits with a spicy dry oak and earthy background. Has just the right amount of sour/tartness with the dry oak and funk. A brilliant and harmonious balance and taste.
(M)- A lively carbonation level that dances on the tongue. Expertly balanced with just the right amount of sour/tart fruit, dry oak, and funk. Awesome stuff that really is a party in the mouth.
(D)- A wonderful wild. What I love about it is how balanced and harmonious it is; not one character overpowers the other, but together, just creates an awesome beer. I did not want my glass to end. 1,189 characterssweemzander, Jun 14, 2010

The smell is exactly what I would expect from a wild ale. Lots of winey characteristics, floral aromas and just a funky aroma in general.
Suprisingly balanced and a sourness that is sharp but appealing. Very unique flavors of cherry, wood and a light caramel note. As expected this finishes very dry and puckering. While sipping this more complex cherry notes come on. 
Pleasing wild ale which seems simple yet complex all the way through. Maybe it just confused my palate though since I haven't had too many wild ales. This is a tasty ale to say the least. 714 charactersstewart124, Jun 12, 2010

Amber brown, slightly hazy body with a small off-white finger of effervescent head; steady streams of CO2. Frothy and sticky lace.
Vinnie at Russian River has done it again. A complex brew with great interplay between malt and sour funk components. A sour punch upfront gives way to herbal, earthy, straw-like flavors that all are balanced out by each other. Some white pepper and tart cherries are noticeable early on. Some oak flavored woodiness in the middle. Bitterness hits at its full power right before the finish with a burst. The brew stimulates the sides of the tongue, which remain stimulated well into vinegar-like, sightly acidic dry finish. Exhibits an oily tongue coating nature as well. 
Medium to highly carbonated with a light body, which accentuates the refreshing character of this beer. Overall an extremely well crafted sour; top notch! 978 charactersTheJollyHop, Jun 11, 2010

Poured a clear dark gold with two fingers of fine bubbled, white head. Lots of carbonation, effervescent. Great aroma with tart cherries and some brett. Light bodied and fairly dry. Very tart flavor with more fruit. Some of the barrel flavors came through in the finish.
Very unique and complex beer. 408 charactershomebrewhawk, Jun 03, 2010

Appearance: Pours deep amber orange with a large, bubbly, creamy, tan head. Nice lacing hangs around. 
Smell: Similar to a kriek lambic in many respects. This beer has dark fruit and malt undertones, tart cherries and cellar funk on the nose. 
Taste: Malt, wood, and funk all give flavor to attempt to balance the sour cherries, with more success than you might think. However, the sour cherry flavor ultimately wins the day. The beer finishes crisp and dry. 
Mouthfeel: High carbonation. The feel is silky smooth at first, but eventually leaves the palate dry.
Drinkability: Very Good. This beer is a sipper, but I just cannot seem to do that! Also, not as balanced as some might like but it hits the mark for me.
Comments: A great beer with fine complexity. Russian river is making some topnotch brews. I have been lucky enough to enjoy two bottles of this wonderful beer. 984 charactersMarvinSnyder, Jun 01, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a bright Amber Copper with a large head for a sour, plenty of haze and lots of carbonation present from the bubbles at the bottom of my chalice. 
Smell of strong funk, brett and cherries throughout. Plenty of tart aromas as well as a granny smith smell.
Taste of strong brett flavors , granny smith apples, tart cherry and drier than a desert on a hot summer day. The Brett flavors are stronger than temptation which I thought I liked more. Not a whole lot of flavor from malts that I can pick up among the battering ram of funk. Among the funk some oak is definitely present. Mouthfeel is on the medium side, with a heavy dosing of carbonation. I am under the assumption TUMS will be on the menu later today. 717 charactersalpinebryant, May 29, 2010

4.33/5  rDev -3.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks a ton to Sugit for hooking me up with this one. I've been very excited to try it.
A - What a great looking beer. Big pop when it was uncorked, and a bright amber body with beautiful head and lacing.
S - Funky! The brett comes through up front, and it smells great. The cherry comes through a little bit, but it is hidden under all that delicious funk.
T&M - The first sip blew me away with sourness. I'm a bit of a sour novice, and this shocked me. As my palate and the beer itself warmed a bit, the velvety funk and sweetness of the cherry are coming out as well. The blend is completely unique to me, and it is growing on me fast. It seems a bit lopsided on the sour side, which to me takes away from the rest of the flavor profile. I could see how some might like the balance as it is though...
D - Considering the punch packed in the first sip, I'm shocked to see how easy this has become to drink after 10 minutes. While a growler of this might be intimidating, I'm having no problem enjoying every last drop of this bottle. 1,040 charactersdougofthefuture, May 28, 2010

A- A dark amber body complemented by a finger of white fizzy head. Head dissipates down to a thin layer but then sticks around for the entire session. Streaky lacing make an overall wonderful appearance to this brew.
S- Lots and lots of sour cherries with a bit of funk. A touch of sweetness underlies the entire beer which helps to balance it out a bit.
T- Wow! That exact word was my first reaction to this beer. A puckering sourness by the sour cherries makes my mouth water with every sip I take. Funkiness is limited a bit by the tartness of the brew, but it is so tasty.
M- Light body with a very prickly mouthfeel. Acidity of the brew makes my mouth feel slick with saliva. 
D- Drank the bottle over the course of an hour. The bottle was more than enough, but each sip left me wanting more. Damn, this is one tasty beer. 
Also, this was my first sour so I was a bit nervous about what I would find. I had heard that this is an excellent "starter" sour, so I'm glad to have received this one. mjmadden came up huge for me with this brew. Thanks again! 1,173 characterskbeals, May 27, 2010

4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a deep burgundy with almost no head. Very little retention or lacing. The nose is vinous and tart, with cherries right out in front, followed by the pinot oak and faint whiffs of brett. A very good indication of what's to come. The first sip is tart and bracing. As the tartness fades, sweet and sour cherry flavors push through on a
wave of subdued oak. The brettanomyces funk works against these extreme flavors to provide an earthy balance in the finish. Medium bodied, with bright, sharp carbonation. A sour ale that slaps you in the face and demands your attention. 576 charactersDaveHS, May 23, 2010

Leaves solid lacing down the glass. Smells of cherries up front with the sour funk coming in after. Delicious smelling. The taste is even better than the smell, with the cherries blending perfectly with the brilliant amount of sourness. Also presents some citrus that I didnt get from the aroma. Nice level of carbonation accents the sour perfectly. This is simply an amazing brew. Thank you Monk's for carrying this.

Murky orange/red/brown color with a big off-white head that leaves plenty of lacings. 
The smell is fairly blurry with a prominent oak character and notes of sweet cherries, grass, mud and brett. Nice acidicty. 
The taste is full of events. Sweet malty cherries and malts up front quickly handing over to a prominent sourness coupled with grass, lemon, minerals and vinegar. A mild bitterness develops towards the finish as the beer ends with nice cherry flavors, oak and a very mild funkiness. 
Medium body and velvety smooth but dry finish. 
A nice one. Very impressive composition. Quite reminiscent of a sparkling fruity wine. 647 charactersricke, May 22, 2010

T- A bit of the cherry flavor is present, with some caramel, spice, and a big dose of oak. The finish is tart, but not nearly as sour as I expected.

A: Ruby amber with a good one-finger creamy head and constant bubbles rushing up the center.
S: Rustic sourness, cherry, and musty oaky alcohol. The earthy, leafy hops aren't very prominent, but exist nonetheless. Overall it comes off as earthy and fruity.
T: It starts off musty with rustic tart underripe apples and moves on to a dry cherry (think framboise) characteristic, leaving a moldy bitterness and a fruity sweetness lingering all over your mouth.
M: Thin, crisp, and dry.
D: Awesome. I wish the bottle was much bigger. 639 charactersne0m00re, May 18, 2010

A- this one pours out a rich amber colored body with a half finger of off white head. the head quickly fizzes away and leaves behind little spots of lacing. 
S- the first thing that comes to mind after sniffing this is "sour." vinegar and lots of barnyard funk. theres a strong odor of cherries in here also. 
T- the sour cherries are beautifully showcased here and take center stage. the funkiness is alot more subdued than i was expecting. pretty tart/sour. very unique, and in a good way. 
M- light bodied. almost puckering. nicely carbonated.

A- Careful pour yielded a small head. Dark orange body with solid lacing and a thick collar of foam remained throughout.
S- Funky and fruity. No sour in the nose surprisingly. The cherries made themselves present after a bit and some swirling. 
T- Sour and tart. The cherries are in the background. No funk in the taste surprisingly. Nice acidity. Very bready/grainy/malty finish. It doesn't detract from the overall taste though. Very good stuff here.

4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5About time I review this.... had it quite a few times now. Thanks to all the awesome traders for sending out bottles of it over the years. I had a batch 004 a couple nights ago and also was part of a batch 1,2,3,4 vertical in late Feb. This review kind of encompasses all of those. 
Batch 4 review:
Pours a semi-hazed reddish color, with a twinge of orange. Whitish foam forms but fades to leave a complete film atop with some nice sticky lace. 
Aromas are complex and really interesting... bursting with cherries, tart, fresh, prematurely picked cherries. Earthy, some dirt, a little bit of an herbal-spicy note that is somewhat hidden. There's also a sharpness to the aroma... fresh batches give the impression of this acetic twang with a touch of alcohol. A little musty wood as well. 
Taste has a bracing tartness, acidity is well integrated but moderate. Red Wine vinegar, woodiness, earth and tannin. Cherry is here and mixed in with some other general berry fruitiness. Long finish, allowing plenty of time to contemplate this wonderful concoction. 
Well carbonated, but not overly prickly - allows all of the flavors to come through. Splitting a bottle is a good serving - I'm really glad they stuck with the 375s for the sours since they are perfect for sharing with one or two other people. Just a masterfully made beer and one of the best examples of American sour ales to date. 
Vintage Notes from Batch 1,2,3,4 Tasting (Feb 27 '10):
Batch 4- Sharpest, with some spice and a little booze. Delicious, but a little rough around the edges compared to the other batches. Though, I kind of like the 'freshness' of it. 
Batch 3- The funkiest, had somewhat of an overture of mustiness that seemed a little stronger than the other batches. Pretty carbonated. 
Batch 2- Was generally picked as the favorite, has this really great herbal-spiciness thing going on that none of the other batches had (or was present in smaller amount). 
Batch 1- Surprisingly good amount of cherry left but was somewhat mellow in general. Some other kind of neutral fruitiness combining in. Kind of felt 'muted'. 2,107 charactersIneedabeerhere, May 12, 2010
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Tasted from 375mL bottle at Lush CBC event, Batch004. Pours amber brown with a thin white head. Aromas of sour cherry, brett, grenadine, and burnt rubber. Flavors are sour with brett, featuring red fruit on back of palate, and green apple front palate. Carbonation is lively with a medium body and a long fruity finish. This beer is super drinkable and very complex. 366 characterswedgie9, May 12, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on 5-8-10 with TCHopCraver, thanks to zoso1967's kind provision.
Appearance: Poured into a wine glass. Color is a golden brown, with some red hints thrown in for good measure. A one-finger head dissipates pretty slowly and leaves a soapy ring of lacing. The lacing is extremely sticky and will cling to any part of the glass if given the chance. There are delightful yeasties and cherry bits dancing around, further agitated by a decent stream of carbonation rising up from the bottom.
Smell: Cherry fragrance abounds! Almost smells like Grandma's in the kitchen baking up a cherry pie! The only difference is that this pie is sour and full of pinot noir, funky yeast, spice, and wood.
Taste: Wow! Not what I was expecting at all. I expected something much sweeter, but instead I find a dryness that is simply enchanting. It's like all the best things about wine and beer brought together in a masterful harmony. This is definitely one of the most refreshing and invigorating beverages I have had the pleasure of consuming. The cherry sweetness of the nose is paired extremely well with the dry, champagne-like flavor.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and refreshingly dry. Starts with a biting fruity punch to the tonsils and ends clean and dry.
Drinkability: Very refreshing and easy to drink, but this beer is so intense that it lends itself more to being a sipper. 1,373 charactersBuckyFresh, May 12, 2010
3.95/5  rDev -12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Sampled a 12.68 oz. bottle from Batch #04X1.
A- Poured from the bottle with a 1/2" light khaki colored head, which slowly receded to a haze layer, leaving impressive dollops of lacing behind. The body was was predominantly clear, with a touch of haze from agitated sediment... and an actively carbonated dark amber color.
S- A wonderfully complex nose, ripe with brett, pedio, and lactobacillus, without being overpowering with aectic notes. Oaky and vinous notes are also dominant on the nose, with lesser nuances of stewed malt and stone fruit.
T- Starts out on the palate with wonderful flavors akin to the nose... but then the acidity and intense tannins cut-through sharply, with vinegar and astringent tannic notes overtaking all other flavors... and lingering unpleasantly into the dry finish. The overboard vinegar and tannins keep this from being a 4.5 in the Taste department.
M- Thin in body... highly attenuated... and slightly slick on the palate. A wonderfully soft carbonation, which creates a faint illusion of creamy texture in the beer. Unfortunately, the moderately strong astringency keeps this from being a 4.5 in the MF department.
D- Don't get me wrong, I like acetic notes in wild ales... but not to the point that they destroy the complexity of the beer. I don't dislike this Supplication... I just wouldn't go through such lengths to acquire it again. 1,382 charactersjgasparine, May 11, 2010

4.73/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tasted this on 5/3/10 with TCGoalie and then again 5/8/10 with Buckyfresh. Thanks for sending it our way, zoso1967! 
A: Served into an oversized wine glass, this beer appears as a copper/peach/raspberry colored amalgamation, and is topped with a pillowy beige head that starts at 1 finger high and slowly recedes. The head retention is exceptional. And, boy oh boy, is the lacing amazing! It is uber sticky and looks like the splashing water that Mickey Mouse controls in "Sorcerer's Apprentice." This is the finest lacing I have seen from a beer. 
S: Aromas of sour fruitiness greet me when I take this beer deeply into my olfactory. I also detect a slight vinegar presence which contrasts nicely to all sorts of fruit smells: cherry, raspberry, peach, golden delicious apple. There is a healthy dose of funk in this smell, as well. The aroma is quite wine-like, closely related to a Pinot Grigio; this is odd, because the label says that the beer was aged in Pinot Noir barrels. Other aromas I get from this beer are some spice in the form of clove, paprika, and black pepper, and also some fresh woodiness. 
T: Wow, sour! My first thought of a similar experience in my mouth is that of sucking on a Sour Patch candy. This beer lights up every crevice of my palate with a dry, biting, cherry, blueberry, golden delicious cider bomb of a flavor. There is some serious funk in the taste, in a great Tower of Power sort of way. You've got to Funkifize! The more I taste this, the more I recognize a similarity to quite dry Champagne. 
M: Supplication takes my mouth on a roller coaster ride. The sourness explodes onto every taste bud, lingers for around ten seconds and then really dries out my mouth with a long, dry cherry-like residue. 
D: I really enjoy the sour and dry character of this beer, and having split two 12.68 bottles in separate sittings, I would certainly classify this brew as a drawn out tasting sipper. This is by far the most original and exciting beer that I have had in awhile and it really shocked and delighted my taste buds. What a great beer! 2,075 charactersTCHopCraver, May 09, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Big big thanks to JackCrow for throwing this one in as an extra.
A: Cloudy, bronze, cherry, head is thick bubbly with tinges of pink and sandy brown mixed together with the standard whipped cream white head. Lacing is a pretty solid curtain, especially considering the sourness of the beer. So good on me for really cleaning my glass.
S: Woody and even slightly sweet cutting though coming through the sourness, very flowery, oaky with an almost unassuming cherry tartness. peppery, white grapes, white peaches.
T/MF: Incredibly woody, tongue numbingly tart. sour cherry, white grape skins, plum skin, lots of skins of fruits is what I am driving at here. Finish is bigger on the berries, blueberry, currants in particular. Feel is full, super bubbly and sticky and dry at the same time. Sticky is perhaps the wrong word to use here, more of a constricting dryness like the beer was stretched over my tongue and shrunk wrapped around it.
D: Fantastic beer, would love to have frequent access to it so I could bury it in my cellar for about a dozen or so years and see what would happen. The tartness my be a bit overpowering for those not expecting it and gives you pause between each sip to let your tongue recover, which I suppose isn't such a bad thing as it lets additional flavors to develop in the finish. 1,315 charactersbluemoonswoon, May 09, 2010

poured from a 375ml bottle to my trusty dogfish head signature glass. it pours a deep copper brown and results in a 1/2 finger foamy beige head that lasted til the beer was finished. after each drink, a fair amount of lacing was left all the way to the rim of the glass..
cherries and tart apples in the nose lasting til the glass has been finished.
sour indeed - a lasting shock to an unexpecting palate. a very interesting sipper, with each sip alternately exciting the tongue and then leaving the mouth conspicuously dry and ready for another drink.
a second bottle is in the closet and I suppose I'll let that one age a bit.
a somewhat confused thumbs up on this one. 748 charactersrobwestcott, May 09, 2010

My reaction t o he first hearty swig was simply "wow", full flavor, sour cherries stinging the taste buds, bretted up, funkathon, love this stuff and so will other sour lovers. worth seeking out and then savoring every time

Upon opening the bottle there was a nice POP from pulling the cork and the aroma of sour cherries and sour fruit fill your nose and make you want to pucker up a little. Pours a brilliant red with good carbonation and a mild light pink head. The initial taste is that of strong sour fruit and it lingers for a while before living the mouth. Takes you back to the days of sucking on sour worms and war heads until you tongue was sore. Liquid candy was how many people described it. This beer is a solid 5. 575 characterspastradul, May 06, 2010

Batch 04x1
Pours a reddish copper, translucent. One finger white head dissipates into a lingering cap. Bubbles everywhere, I can tell this is going to be spritzy. 
S: Sour green apples, but musty. Getting alot of brett too.
T: No surprise, immensely tart and sour. But why can I not stop sipping this? Really "fun" to drink. Im thinking more sweet and sour green apples than cherries. Brett funk is melded throughout the entire palate. I had some trouble detecting any wood characteristics, maybe next time? 
M: Medium bodied, spritzy carb. Leaves you salivating as if you are drinking something like orange or grapefruit juice.
D: Hmmm. I would have to say drinkability suffers because of acidity. A whole 375 ml gave me a little heartburn. Additionally, any sour can become tiresome to the palate. Excellent beer when you are in the mood for it, a "world class" sour. 893 characterszoolzoo, May 05, 2010

Pours a strawberry copper red with a one finger head that lingers throughout the brew. Lacing sticks to the glass and forms objects that look like white mountains. I have to say the head and lacing of this is second to none...very impressive.
The smell of cherries dominates the scent. I'm also getting a bit of strawberry, spicy clove, and alcohol esters. The overall scent character is much like a dessert wine.
Wow, this is much more sour than anticipated. I was expecting a wine quality and it is anything but. This has a similar quality to a tear jerker gum ball. The taste of cherry starts the flavor and quickly morphs into a sour explosion that changes character and lasts for 12 seconds. The taste of this beer lasts forever, it is wonderful.
This is relatively light in mouthfeel but really gets the saliva going. The strange part is my mouth is really dry and clean afterword. This beer eats my saliva.
Overall, this is a very drinkable ale. Strangely, I think it would be really good mixed with iced tea like an Arnold Palmer...though that would be disrespectful to Supplication. The complexity keeps me coming back for more, this is a treat. 1,249 charactersTCgoalie, May 05, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared by Reid - thanks! Batch 2 I believe.
Pours a slightly hazy brownish-amber color with a one-finger off-white head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells of muted dry caramel malts overpowered by large amounts of tart cherries and funk. There are also hints of vinegar but they definitely belong and take nothing away from the rest of the aroma.
Tastes similar to how it smells. Basic dry caramel malt flavors serve as the backbone for everything that goes on. Tart cherry flavors that have just enough sweetness to keep this from being even slightly mouth-puckering. Also present are large but not overpowering amounts of funk with hints of wet hay. The ending is crisp and leaves tart cherry flavors lingering on the palate.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a nice thickness with active carbonation.
Drinkability is also very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall I think this is just the tiniest step up from Consecration. It's impossible to describe but I feel as though it's a tiny bit more complex in the funk department. Either way, both are extraordinary and well worth a shot. 1,175 charactersglid02, Apr 29, 2010

t - Taste is very sour cherries, wine, and a little funnk. Very enjoyable.
m - Medium body and carbonation.
d - I really enjoyed this one. I tried Temptation, Supplication, and Consecration all in one night and thought Supplication was the best by far. Would love to try again. 554 charactersmdfb79, Apr 29, 2010

S: Very nice aroma and pungent. Sour with a touch of phenols. Apples and spice with some sweetness and an underlying woody / mushroomy note.
T: Sweet and sour up front fading to a spiciness and finishing dry and woodsy. Alcohol starts to come through at the finish. There's definitely a tanin note from the wine barrell againg.
M: Thick and smooth with perfect carbonation.

Pours cloudy orange in color. Little head that quickly leaves the building. Moderate lacing left behind.
S- Oak, wood, apples, and cherries. I believe it's gonna be pretty sour!
T- Very noticable wood profile. There is a sourness present (of course). It's pretty tart, but not as tart as I was anticipating. Granny smith apple are present.
M- Pretty good! Nice semi-dry finish. The carb level was great. Again, not stripping my tastebuds, but it's fairly tart.
D- Is really good. I like this a lot. I cared for the consecration even more. I would have no problem at all drinking muliples of this. 658 charactersurwithdave, Apr 26, 2010

S: Strong oak, very vinous - reminds me of my uncle's wine celler. Dark fruit, mostly cherry but some prune. A slight funk to the nose, and a touch of alcohol.
T: Holy sh*t. Definitely get tart cherries, a bit of orange peel, lemon, grapefruit. A funky quality, but not Lambic funk - it's more earthy, more subtle. Get the oak, and wines notes. Unbelievably clean finish, slight bitterness. 
M: Funk and carbonation just roll over your tongue. Medium body. Leaves your mouth watering begging for more but also very satisfied. 
Amazing brew. So consistent. A lot of beers have a great nose, but fail to back it up in the taste or mouthfeel - everything is in sync here. Gets better with each progression. 868 characterscpone, Apr 26, 2010

A: Cloudy burnt orange color. The pour created a nickel size off whtie head that hung around for a while and left some spotty lace.
A: Sour and funk. I get notes of fruit, probably the cherries, lemon, peach, green apple and sweet malts. A nice bittering hop presence show up, and then is overtaken by a horseblanket funk. Nice.
T: Taste is more of the same, sweet and sour. Notes of tart cherries and other ripe fruit. Bitter hops and sweet malts give way to a puckering sourness. Finishes dry, and smooth from the oak aging, and ohh so tart.
M: Good levels of carbonation, light to medium body. Appropriate for the style.
D and overall impression: Drinkability for any wild is a little on the lower side for me, due to the palate wrecking sourness. But this one is really quite nice. I would have no problem taking down a bottle or two of this one. Overall, probably my favorite sour to date. Really enjoyed my sample, and am excited to have one of my own.

Smell is very tart, fruity, and cherry. Smells like a weaker version of what I'd expect from some wines.
Immediately hits the tongue with sour tartness. The intensity of the sourness builds a bit as it rolls over the palate, and finishes dry. The sour cherries are very dominant in the flavor. Tastes also like funky fruit other than cherries.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and tongue biting. The sourness really attacks the tongue.
Drinkability on this one is low. While delicious, I wouldn't want to have more than one of these in a night. The one I do have, though, goes down super easy.
Overall, this is an amazing beer. This is completely different from what I drink, but it's delicious and a wonderful change of pace. 819 charactersghostee, Apr 23, 2010

Huge pop off the cork on this one, pours a hazy weird red-brown color with a nice fluffy white head. The lacing on this is crazy, some of the thickest I've ever seen and all over the glass. 
Smell is very musty and funky, cherries, very much like a lambic. 
The cherry taste is excellent and super-fresh and covers your tongue and gums in a smooth, sour silk. It is sour but not overly so at all, keeps you wanting more and more after each sip. Funky yeast, musty cherries and lemon linger in the aftertaste for a frighteningly long time, so awesome. I think I still pick up some of the brown ale notes, a slight caramel/vanilla taste. The oak/woodiness starts to show through more in the finish, and it is the most up-front WOOD taste I've had in a beer. It literally tastes like chewing on tree bark (a good thing in this case.) 
The mouthfeel here is great and creamy, very carbonated, but I have to give it a 5 here simply because of the way it just covers your mouth with awesomeness. Any alcohol taste is massacred, it doesn't stand a chance. 
Sourness and price may affect drinkability but for this style, this is amazingly easy to drink, tasty and refreshing. Every sip left me yearning for more, I finished this too quickly. This is only my 3rd sour I've had so I'm no expert, but goddamn this was a good beer. I can't wait to try Russian River's other sours. 1,418 charactersChico1985, Apr 23, 2010

Smell was woody and earthy. Not fruity.
Taste was tart and drying. Wine like. No sign of cherries here. Slight fruit in the aftertaste. Not funky. I like this beer but I expected more fruit. I always enjoy sour, dry beers and this fits that bill.

Golden brown color, tart cherry smell with a bit of funk in the nose but not much, mostly wood and cherries. The taste offered ripe, juicy cherries, wine-soaked oak and tart, sour cherry skins. Mouthfeel was superb, moderate carbonation with big bubbles, a nice dry, fruity finish. Highly recommended, an outstanding sour. 409 charactersnatelocc787, Apr 23, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks Justin for sharing this a couple of weeks ago at the get together. Review from notes..
A- Pours a clear reddish color. Two finger light tan head that stays around for a short bit. Nice streaking lacing on the sides of the glass. 
S- The front end of this is big lactic tart aroma mixed with big oak notes as well. Cherries are the standout in this beer with fruit. Some light barnyard funk in the ending of this. I expected this to be more in the upfront but smells great nevertheless.
T- Big funky sourness from the cherries right upfront. Almost mouth puckering from the get go (like cherry sour patch kids). Oak notes come into play a whole lot more right after the cherry explosion. Lactic acid comes and goes with the barnyard funk. This follows the nose almost perfect with what to expect. Simple but also very complex in layers. 
M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation was a little high for me and I think for the style. Light funk and tons of cherries left on the palate with tons of oak and funky cherry left in the aftertaste. Drying on the palate a lot after each sip. Flavors are bold and crisp in the mouthfeel. 
D- This beer is very drinkable. This has to be the best sour I have had from RR. I would suggest this beer to anyone that wants to be blown away from a already amazing style. 1,306 charactersalleykatking, Apr 23, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured a clear orange color with a limited amount of white head that dissovled quickly and left a faint amount of lace on the glass. Nose is a fruity sourness that is somewhat reminescent of oranges. Taste is tart, funky, sour and includes a bit of the previously hinted fruitiness. Light bodied and highly carbonated it has quite a dry finish. As it warms my palate becomes increasingly perplexed as I pick up on tastes of funky must coupled with dry fruits nearly apple-like but sour like a green apple candy. Brett is apparent in both smell and taste without being dominating. Each sip is so drying and puckering that it is hard to stop, put down the glass and stop salivating. This is a very interesting beverage that I found enjoyable and another example of a style I'm not quite familiar with but really enjoy and look forward to trying more. 848 charactersstakem, Apr 20, 2010

A - This beer pours a bright red pinkish color. It has a nice white lacy bubbly head. The beer loses points because it has just so much sediment in it. Probably the most I have ever seen in a beer.
S - Straight tart fruitiness right out of the gate. The beer hints with sour cherries to follow. After that, a small hint of barrel finishes.
T - Begins with the Cherries. Wow, so much cherry tartness going on. Follows with acidic notes and finishes slightly woody. Yup, Woody. Damn good.
M - Smooth, creamy, and highly carbonated. It coats the mouth. The only problem is that the floaties from the sediment are slightly noticable, and I don't like that.
D - It is damn good. Drinkability is probably a 5 on tap, but the bottle seems more acidic, and the the floaties prevent this from getting a 5.
O - This sour is amazing. On tap, it's epic, but that will wait for another review down the road. Get this beer if you enjoy a nice sour fix. 998 charactersabecall98, Apr 20, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle from Supermarket Liquors in Ft. Collins. $12.29. Batch 04X5
A: Hazy brown/burnt orange in color with about half an inch or so of incredibly dense cream colored head. Impressive retention as well as lacing. Fair amount of bubbles moving up from the nucleation point in this goblet. 
S: Sour funk, that is the initial go to smell, super acidic sour notes followed by a decent funky sweaty feet smell. Leans more towards the sour cherry and lemon like profile. Then the barnyard really starts to hit in this one, very strong barnyard, moldy straw/hay. Then way in the back is a caramel maltyness as well. This is everything I ask for in a sour, just not that amazing to be a 5.0.
T: Lemon and sour cherries, mix in with an incredible amount of acidic flavors, this sucker is incredibly sour. Wow. As it continues to warm the notes of cherries really play into this one. Behind that is a strong brown ale with notes of caramel and some notes of a light vanilla as well. Definite lingering funk in here the sweaty horse, barnyard phunknastyness lingers forever on the tongue. Just a hint of bitterness on the tongue here that lingers nicely after the finish. My tongue is torn, screaming for another tasty drink as well as reeling from the overall sourness of this one. Awesome. 
M: Medium body, creamy, very creamy in the mouth from the perfect carbonation it just rolls across your mouth and down the throat, and then dries up making you want another sip. Doesn't make my spit nearly as thick as other sours, but definitely has a nice lactic profile. Slight little bit of alcohol heat as well. 
D: Very high on the drinkability, but I have a feeling enjoying a second one in a sitting wouldn't give the beer its due. Incredibly easy as this basically disappears in your mouth. The sourness would wears on me a bit, but it is incredibly enjoyable. Definitely in that upper echelon of beers for me. Highly recommended. 1,931 characterspokesbeerdude, Apr 20, 2010

Appearance - Beautiful deep amber with nice head that leaves a beautiful lacing with decent retention. 
Smell - ohhh - tart dark fruits grape, licorice, cherry a bit of a sour funkiness to it - man this is exciting... 
Taste - man that is some sour deliciousness. Just read the back of the bottle and the strong grape and cherry tones make a lot of sense now. Sour cherry, grape, deep fruitiness with hints of oak that I perceived as roastiness for a split second - followed with a potent funk from the bret et al. ending in a very pleasant dry tartness. Much more complexity that I cannot put my finger on. Can't wait to review with increased tasting abilities. 
Exceptional beer - seriously fantastic. I have fallen off the deep end into a deep love of well brewed sour beers. Wow this is good. 859 charactersZaplt, Apr 16, 2010

T - Tastes of mouth-puckering cherries and wine grapes with a vinegar acidity. Very tasty.
M - This is a very carbonated beer and the bubbles kept coming during the whole 30 minutes it took me to savor this beer. The beer has a sort of bubbly coating effect in the mouth.
D - VERY good. Yes, this is mouth-puckering sour but it is a dry taste and very refreshing at the same time. 
The one small bottle I purchased was $12.50, so it is somewhat pricey. However, this is a beer I can see myself buying plenty more of in the future on special occasions. 759 charactersUCLABrewN84, Apr 16, 2010

Some fruit hides behind the upfront vinegary scent, with a bit of yeast adding some funkiness. The flavors were similar, just magnified. The dry bitterness was dominate and the flavors lurk in the background.
Body is good for the style, although I found it a bit thin. Drinkability was good, depending your tolerance for sourness. Overall, a good beer, worth a shot for anyone and a must try for sourheads. 586 charactersbeertunes, Apr 15, 2010

This beer pours a lovely dark mahogany with a slightly tan head that sticks around in clumps and leaves wonderful lace. Surprising that it is not more carbonated given the fact that it was a gusher. The aroma is quite nice and full of sour cherries, vinegar, Funk and earthiness. Taste is very sour and very delicious. Puckering and complex. Pinot noir, tart cherry, woodiness, some wine like tannins, lemon like citrus... there is just so much going on. More vinegar than lactic acid, but both come into play. There is some alcoholic warmth in there as well, and it plays off the other flavors. The finish is long, super tart and slightly sticky. Mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty refreshing and drinkable, but this is one to savor. A fine sour from an amazing brewery. 908 characterszoso1967, Apr 15, 2010

a- pours a light orange almost IPA color. maybe a pale tainted by the cherries? produced a substantial amount of fluffy white head. probably the best lacing I've seen on an American wild.
s- funky, sour cherries to the max. the cherries are so vibrant and inviting. it's hard to describe the strength of the aroma. awesome.
t- definitely some mouth puckering acetic sourness up front. it's got some great complexity to it. all the flavors are as intense and as they are pleasant. to sum it up. sour, brett, sweet cherry candy, hint of vinegar. I really can't imagine anything being much better than this. Certainly the best I've had to date.
M- super dry, light/medium bodied with fairly subtle carbonation. can mouth puckering count as a plus count as a plus in this category? since I'm not sure I'll keep it at a 4.5. BM me if you think I should bump it up.
d- yea, I could drink all my money away on this beer. and probably be pretty satisfied with my investment. dead and dying from starvation but enjoying some extremely fine brew. I've been borderline bumping up a couple stats so I'll say 5. 1,161 charactersFreethyhops, Apr 11, 2010

The smell is so complex. It has a clean barnyard aroma, sweet green apples and sweet tarts candy.
And the flavor reflects that of the aroma. The flavor is very tart. The first impression I had was "sweet tarts". Then I get some earthy wild sweet cherryish/green apple taste. 
The mouthfeel is pretty smooth for being so tart. It's kinda hard for me to get down. But pretty drinnkable for a sour. 465 charactershoplover82, Apr 11, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Draft pour into an elongated chalice, I'm guessing 12 oz @ $7.25. Much more economical than purchasing a bottle. (Although I've done that too @ $17 and have seen as high as $25. The bottle is 375 mL, slightly more than 12 ounces...)
A: Pours with a small white linen colored head that never quite forms. Tight knit bubbles with decent retention, but only in the form of a thin crescent moon shaped collar. Some stick is provided from the collar as I sip, but most of any would-be lacing slides slowly back down. Plenty of bubbles float through the blush colored body. There is a slight haze to the body. 85% transparent.
S & T: The aroma is brett dominated, funkiness with a semi sweet and sour fruit quality. Not exactly identifiable as cherries in my opinion, but definitely sour fruit. Wood flavors of cedar and oak. Vinous, lightly tannic and very acidic. Absolutely incredible.
M: An INdisputable, IRRefutable "5" hands down. The mouthfeel is actually a "6"! The sourness is enhanced by the wildly fine carbonation caused by the brettanomyces and other bugs. Completely tongue and throat coating with a desert dry finish.

Popped the cork off and head started to pop right out - this is a lively one. Traded a Imperial Storm Trooper (one of my favorites) for this one so hopefully it lives up to the hype. I had also never had a wild ale before so I am nervous. I won't bore you with the information that is already found on the bottle... but wow a lot goes into this beer... very impressive. The Russian River Pliny and Blind Pig has blown my socks off and I'm not expecting any less from this offering. Enjoyed while watching the red sox yankee rubber match. 
A - A wild head that has a mind of its own despite my gentle pour. I can see why the bottle recommends a gentle pour. A beautiful orangey red with lots of carbonation. Looks like champagne. 
S - The most potent aroma I have smelled to date. I popped this in my buddies kitchen and he could smell it before I even brought it into the living room. I didn't even need to put my nose up to the glass to take it in. Sour grapes, cherries, oak, a champagne funk. 
T - Sour would be an understatement. Mouth puckering acidic vinegar taste with a cherry sweetness. More like champagne than beer. An amazing creation none the less. Much respect goes out to the brewer. Not my cup of tea but I can really appreciate the delicate balance that goes into this beer. 
M - Complex, heavily carbonated as it should be per the style. My mouth puckered as if I was biting directly into a lemon. Never experience a beer like this before. Big shout out to Thorpe429 for hooking me up with this trade. 
D - I did have some trouble with this beer. Not the beers fault. I am unaccustomed to the style and still have my training wheels on. This beer really opened up a whole new world for me. In my opinion is definitely a sipper. There is crazy stuff going on here and I will soon grow into my pants and be able to run free in this wild pasture. 1,885 charactersDNICE555, Apr 08, 2010
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine April 2007.
Batch 001. Aged in pinot noir barrels for over a year, with sour cherries, Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus (oh my!) introduced over the course. Presented in an awesome 375 ml corked-and-caged bottle.
Decanted ever-so-slowly so as not to rouse the sediment, the beer pours a brilliant deep orange with reddish hues. Active carbonation rises to form a half-inch layer of off-white foam that rests at a ringed lace. Big, Lambic-like aroma--tart and barnyardy--but much cleaner, with suggestions of sweet fruits and bread. First sip is an awakening of the senses, with a big smack of tartness and a pleasing acidic sharpness. Sour-cherry flavors run deep, and also provide a gentle sweet- ness and fruitiness to counter the tartness. Suggestions of weathered hops and leafy undertones within light tannins. Cheesy wine and oak provide some background complexities and are cushioned by a layer of Brett breadiness. Finish is very vinous, with a lingering tartness, tannins and a dry, puckering finish.
One of the best examples of American artisan brewing to have met our palates. Period. Don't bother pairing this one with any food. It's to be indulged in on its own. Batch 002 is on sale now at their website ($11), and they'll ship to about half of the states in the US. 1,329 charactersBeerAdvocate, Apr 07, 2010

The beer poured out a wonderfully dark reddish brown, with a bit of film and very strong lacing. The aroma was delicious: fruit and malt sweetness, complex and finishing up with a bit of spice.
This beer has phenomenal flavor: sour up front with bitterness following and a long, lingering and delicious aftertaste of fruit and spice. Absolutely wonderful taste. The mouthfeel was also robust and spot-on for the beer, Russian River has delivered again. While this is certainly no chugging or session beer, I would have loved to crack open another bottle and sip my way through it. 637 charactersocmpoma, Apr 04, 2010

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4350 ml bottle, shared with a buddy during a recent tasting and poured into two Sam Adams perfect pint glasses.
His glass (the first poured) is a beautiful, perfectly clear dark tangerine, with notes of tarnished gold and dark reddish browns. A fuzzy off-white head is clingy, and creates some incredible lacing: a furry, white wall that literally covers every inch of the glass, no gaps. I tend to pour out my yeast, so the second glass was far hazier, reminiscent of a hefeweizen, though with the same glorious color scheme and lacing. The final dollops of orange yeast sit atop the white head, reminding of an egg, sunny side up. 
In the nose, we have oak balanced with the bright sourness of cherries and lemons, subtle piney hops and sweet almonds. A crisp odor. 
The taste begins subdued -- almost like a regular, sweet brown. But then, like the blooming flowers accompanying this spring seasonal, the flavor just opens up. Oakiness rules the realm, but a blast of sour cherries hits at the finish. Very balanced, not overpowering. Like a fine, masterfully complex champagne. 
Medium body, wavy. Carb is high, as it should be. 
A prolific beer from a prolific brewer, Supplication is a must-have for any lover of sours, browns, or the finer things in life. 1,266 charactersPhelps, Apr 03, 2010

T: One thing I learned in wine country is to sip once, then sip twice and let it linger on the palate. First sip, I was not sure what to make of it, but as I tasted my 2nd and 3rd sips, I began to really enjoy this. A truly great cherry tart is present throughout. Through the middle and backend, the slight citrus and oak flavors come through. I kept drinking and drinking this enjoying it thoroughly.
M: Leaves a slight tart flavor on the palate. Very pleasing and not too over powering. The mouth finishes very dry.
D: I really liked this beer a lot. At first sip I was unsure of it, but as I drank more and more, I came to appreciate this gem! 1,043 charactersIronCitySteve, Apr 02, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +7.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Received in a recent trade with colonelforbin. I've been waiting to try one of these and am damn excited to crack it open! Have a few more coming soon! Split with friends during our Wednesday gathering. Poured into my Portsmouth snifter.
Looks a murky, hazy orange-brown with a fizzy, sand-colored head made of loosely packed bubbles: Champagne-esque. This is one cloudy beer...of course, I ignored the label and dumped all of that goodness into the glass! Thick spotted lacing was left behind - I drank this one pretty quickly and there was quite a bit lacing around at the end!
I absolutely love that funky smell that comes from the brettanomyces and the lactobacillus. Nobody does it better than Vinnie. There is definitely a smell coming from the cherries - a bit of fruity sweetness. I'm not generally very good at discerning the wood smell in beers, but this one is obvious. Smells great!
Ah, just as I had hoped! A tiny prologue of sweetness before that tart blast! The cherries are a bit more subdued than I anticipated, but I appreciate that...I'm not a fan of sweet beers so this one makes the cut. While the cherries are a bit more subtle, the wood is definitely not - it is obviously in there. And the light wine qualities are certainly around as well. Light, puckering, tart, and full of good. And it all lingers. The fizzy carbonation does not detract...pretty much expected with the style.
Overall, I must admit that I was extremely impressed with this beer. I absolutely love Russian River's Temptation, and Supplication is right there with it. I really need to compare side by side. It's a damn shame the price tag is what it is...oh yeah, and that it isn't available in Indiana. Outstanding!

Got this in the Sour BIF from SleepyDave
poured up a nice white head that rose one and a half fingers above a pinkish/grapefruit colored beaultiful lookin beer. Great lacing too.
Smells cherry. And oaky. Has a hint of wine or grapes too.
Taste follows smell. Has a nice sour bite-- not the mist sour beer ever, but certainly tasty nonetheless. Has an underlying sweetness that compliments the sourness nicely.
Lots and lots of carbonation in this thing!! It feels very fine and velvety though... Like a champagne. Pretty light body that drinks very easy.
Not sure I could drink this all night, but a glass here or there would bean excellent treat. 696 charactersAleWatcher, Apr 01, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5When I poured it into my tulip glass the active carbonation danced and propped up a frothy head. I expected the added cherries would have the overly sweetened bar cherry flavor. This is not the case. The cherries taste just as natural as if I had picked them from the tree myself, and the wood from the oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity to the flavor that's just right. What is most interesting about this beer, and what I enjoyed the most was the sourness of it. When you finish your sip the tartness begs you to take another and leaves your mouth watering for more. 577 characterspnkRed, Apr 01, 2010

I poured into a snifter, light amber in color with a medium white head. There was minimal lacing. The aroma is very vinous. It is full of sour cherries and oak. It has a perfect cherry flavor. The tartness of the cherries and funk of the brett meld perfectly in this one. It finishes dry and has a little sweetness to it. The beer is a light/medium in body with mild carbonation. For me this is a great sipper. The best "sour" I have had to date. 504 charactersbonkers, Apr 01, 2010

Redish-orange color, with little to no head in the pour, but lots and lots of carbonation. It Seemed as though the beer must've had a thousand different flavors it was so delicious. The main flavor that stuck out to me had a sour citrus feel that just burst in your mouth. i can only imagine the type of alcoholic i would become if this beer was readily available to me.Basically this beer taste like heaven. if you haven't tried i would suggest you do so asap. 554 charactersberpwillie, Mar 31, 2010

S- Exceptional it is! Nice musty woody funk with strong flavors of tart apple and pear. Hints of grass and leather.
T- Wonderful flavors of lemon peel and tart pear and citrus bitterness. Hints of pinot grigio and berries. Nice sourness that clings to the tip of the tongue.
M- Superb, very effervescent. Leaves a tangy aftertaste in your mouth

4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap at Toronado, SF.
Lighting was dark, but the color appeared to be a red-orange rusty color. Minimal head or lacing. 
The smell is like fresh cherries and brett. Sour, but not too sour, and funky.
A rather unique beer, I must say. Cherries, sour and tart, a touch of wood, and funky yeast. 
The body is medium and the carbonation reminds me of a sparkling wine. Mouth. Puckering.
This was equally fun to smell as it was to drink. 439 charactersVonerichs, Mar 31, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I happened to be walking down Pine St. in Philadelphia after a dentist appointment today. Ordinarily, this would just be another street. However, I was far enough east that my journey would take me right past a Philadelphia beer mecca known as The Foodery. If you strolled by briskly you could easily mistake it for your typical corner bodega/deli if it weren't for the assortment of beer bottles on display in the windows. I love when I find myself in the neighborhood.
The store has the usual suspects in terms of the Belgians, a wide variety of American craft and a great selection of one-offs and randoms scattered around the back of the store. I saw the bottle of Supplication sitting by itself on a shelf and I knew I needed to purchase it. I gave up browsing at that point since I knew this one bottle would be a small fortune and worth every penny: ~$19.50 for 375ml.
I was planning to eat spicy chili tonight so I made it a point to enjoy this beverage fully before touching my dinner. Didn't want to ruin my palate with such a great beverage ready to entertain my mouth.
I poured 90% of the beer into a Duvel glass and did a good swirl to capture the yeast (against the advice of the bottle) as I like to get the fully experience even if it means extra yeast flavors. The color was brown/cherry. Jumping ahead, as I drank the lacing was light but looked like it would never give up its grasp of the side of the glass. No real head on this beer.
The smell is sour but nothing pastoral or farm-like about it other than the fact that it makes you feel strangely relaxed much like being in the rural lands of central Pennsylvania. Who would have thought that sour is a smell? As you breathe it in you can almost taste sour without anything touching your lips. The smell is enhanced as you take the first sip.
Exactly what I hoped. Sour thought smooth at the same time. The liquid is thin and first but fills your mouth instantly with flavor that makes it feel a lot more heavy-bodied. I don't know enough about the bacteria in this beer to say how they each contribute to the flavor but overall the wildness of it is enagaging but not overwhelming. It is not too wild. After drinking a sip and thinking about it for a minute the acting of licking one's lips is a treat. It is a different sense of sourness. Speaking of sourness, on the grand scale of sour this really isn't too bad. I'd give it a 6/10 on the sourness scale.
Overall, this is definitely an easy drinker which might be surprising for such an extreme mouth shocker. Equally shocking, the weight of the bottle. This is one heavy bottle for such a small volume of beer. Totally worth the price to try but I don't think I'd penny up another $20 as I'd rather try other Russian River offerings first. 2,772 characterschakadrum, Mar 30, 2010

Corked & Caged 375ml bottle
Thanks to timbro81 for hooking me up with this long time want!
This pours a clear amber color. The head of tan colored foam is thick, creamy, and over four-fingers worth. The retention is great and the lacing is full and sticky.
Get a light touch of definite barnyard funk, ala Brett. Tart cherries, along with a hint of peaches. Mild yeastiness. Light hint of oak.
This does not smell as sour as expected, but it does smell delicious.
The brett funk really shines here but it is doing battle for attention with a nice presence of cherry tartness. It has a level of cherry sweetness lying just beneath the surface.
This is a wonderfully balanced and very flavorful beer. Funky, tangy, tart and sweet, all play in harmony.
Light-to-medium body on this one with a high level of carbonation. It is very sharp and crisp.
The 7.00%abv is nowhere to be found in this one. Jesus, it's smooth. You could drink this one very quickly and very often.

Similar to other Russian River sours, but great overall. (7/5/7/4/16 - 3.9)
Re-rate: 375mL bottle of Batch 04x2 tasted on 3/11/10. Pourse solid orange with beautiful cream head. Aroma of orange, cherry, oak and pine.

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this on tap at Toronado during SF Beer week.
Supplication by RR is a brown Ale aged in French oak Pinot Noir barrels with three strains of Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and sour cherries. 7% abv. 
The Supplication 07 is a two year old aged version. It poured beautiful teak color. It smelled of fresh sour cherries, oak and Brett. It tasted sour on the sides and back of my tongue with some oak dryness. There is cherry fruit upfront but it is sour but not super pucker sour. 
The Supplication 09 looked pretty much the same except a shade lighter. It's nose was not as pungent at all compared to the 07. The taste is more fresh bing cherries, more oak and less sour pucker. I got some pucker on the roof of my mouth, but it has much more fruit compared to the 07. If you are new to sours, this one would be a good one to try. It's not as full bodied as the 07 but it tastes more fruity and oak. Dave liked the 09 better, however I appreciated the more sourness you got out of the 07. 1,002 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010

A: Beautiful amber/orange hue with tiny cherry particles floating everywhere (I emptied every last drop of the beer), creating a speckled appearance similar to a robin's egg . Nice head retention and lacing.
S: Mouth watering. What an enticing pleasant sour aroma with prominent fresh cherries.
T: Even better than I hoped for. This is exactly the sweet/sour balance I have been looking for in a cherry beer. The cherry flavor is so delicious, it floored me. The beer is sour, but not overly so, and has hints of sweetness that meld brilliantly. It just tastes so clean and fresh - I don't know how else to describe it. I could go on and on singing Vinnie's praises...
M: No alcohol detectable whatsoever. The finish is fantastic, with a light wild yeast and cherry pie aftertaste.
D: This beer is chuggable and dangerous. I wish I had an entire cellar full of this. Easily one of the best and most enjoyable beers I have ever had. 946 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 25, 2010

Batch 4 I beleive. 
Pours at first clear, but becomes hazy as subsequent pours are dished out between the four of us. Copper orange in color, has about a finger of white head that has decent retention, and a swirl here and there keeps it going strong. Leaves a bunch of lacing down the sides of the glass.
The nose is very vinous, and oaky. Not as funky as I expected, but boy it is tart. Cherries and light vinegar notes round it out.
Starts out very sour and tart, with sweet fruits and malts lying in the background, almost completely covered up by the sourness. Cherries are harder to pick out in the taste than they were in the nose, and again it's very wine-like. Again, not much brett or funky flavors. It's great tasting, but I think it's just slightly less sour than Isabelle.
Mouthfeel is about medium in body, with an appropriately high carbonation. As the carbonation dies down, it becomes smooth and easy drinking. Drinkability is great.
Overall, Russian River doesn't disappoint with this one. Is it better than Isabelle? Some may say so but I don't think so. In a year or two, however, this bottle will probably be much better, so look at it whichever way you want. An exceptional beer and one I would love to seek out in the future. Thanks Kevin for opening another bottle that has been on my wants for some time. 1,426 charactersMistofminn, Mar 24, 2010

M- mouthfeel is a bit thin but fitting for something of this acidity and abv; I would like to see this with a lil more "oomph" in the mouth department though.

4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On-tap at TJs yesterday in PA for Pliny The Younger and Friends, reviewed from notes. This beer was a life changer for me. I have had a decent amount of sours but nothing that remotely compared to this one. I think I may become addicted to sours in the next months just because I have always enjoyed very sour foods. Anyways... Served in a large flute like glass. Pours like wine with not much head or lace but a pretty awesome looking orange-copper color. The smell is nice. The lambic-like sour/funk notes are there with oak and cherries. Wine notes come through and also grapes. This balance became more evident as the beer warmed up and I fell in love with it. The taste of this beer was the real life changer for me. Very smooth. Starts out with an absolutely fantastic amount of sour fruits. The wine notes hit me soon after. The aftertaste is what really killed me, out of this world. From the time I swallowed the beer to a few minutes after the taste of cherries just grew on my tongue. Eventually it just tasted like a mouthful of fresh cherries (mind you there hasn't been beer in my mouth for a minute now). The oak and grape notes only add to a flavor that really needs no assistance. God.. the cherries are so good. Mouthfeel is suitable and enhances the beer for me. The body is moderate and nice and creamy. The sour makes my cheeks pinch but I like it. A coat of fruit sour, grapes and cherries stays on the tongue for a long, long time. Do I have to explain the Drinkability? The taste was perfect for the whole glass, the price was great. I will never view sour beers the same after this and will have a new standard to judge them to. I can only hope to have this beer again sometime in my life. 1,714 characterscbutova, Mar 22, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A nice two finger head formed atop the beer in my tulip glass. Had a brief stay and fell to a thin cap. Beer is a dull copper color with excellent clarity. At first a touch of lacing, but later it was all over the inside of the glass.
Aroma is awesome. Tart cherries, earthiness and some oak notes. As it warms the aroma mellows and becomes more toasty.
Wow, I just love this. Very nutty, toasted cashews. Of course, nice tart cherries and a touch of vinegar. Wood notes linger in your mouth. Some of the same flavors I encountered in Allagash Vagabond. Once you become accustomed to the sour notes, the flavor just explodes. The oak notes play perfectly with the tart cherry flavor. 
Mouth feel is light and fluffy initially then powerful. Carbonation brings the flavor to life.
Ok I'll be trading for more of this. Just an awesome beer to drink. I am making myself savor every last drop however, I want to consume it faster as it's just wonderful. Hats off again to Russian River. 986 charactersReagan1984, Mar 22, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Batch 4x1. Pours a hazy copper orange color with a large two finger white head that's kept afloat with some gentle swirls, and leaves some killer sheets of lacing all down the Duvel tulip. Absolutely fabulous looking. 
Lots of carbonation bubbles being released from the laser etching, so I give it several swirls to get the aroma going. Very pleasing, oaky, wine-like aroma with only a touch of funk in the background. Light vinegar and cherries are in there somewhere, along with some citrus fruits. 
Holy tomole, this is one sour brew! Starts out tart and sour, followed by a sweetness from the malts that are buried deep within, followed by some tart cherry, although the cherry is a little less prominent than I had expected, along with some lemony flavors that are generally associated with the brett, and a dry, oaky, vinous finish. Not much in the way of musty, leathery type flavors and aromas I usually get from wilds, which is a nice change. Overall, a tart, fruity, wine-like dry beer. Good stuff. 
Body is medium, with high carbonation. As the beer gets close to the bottom of the glass, most of the carbonation has subsided from constant swirling (I can't help but swirl this glass and bury my nose in it) and it has become quite creamy, which is in an interesting contrast to the bite of the acidity. 
Overall, this is one great brew and the 375ml serving is perfect. It's sour as hell which could kill the drinkability in any bigger of a containment vessel, but this serving was just right. Becomes incredibly more cherry like and complex as it warms, and once the carbonation has mellowed, this is one fine beer. Not sure if I like it more than Consecration, but it's another great from RR. Can't wait to see how this one ages. 1,748 charactersKeefD, Mar 22, 2010

The beer is a deep amber, clear save for the little bits of somethingoranother floating around in it. The head is off-white very full and fluffy and prone to lacing and leaving fluff. 
Nose is lactic-acid, like buttermilk. Upon warming a bit I note some brown spices and green grasses.
Taste is sour with a bit of tartness. No, really. I can flesh out a bit of sweetness back there someplace and some plum but this is one tart treat. I imagine some more complexity could be there someplace...
mouthfeel is light and finish is dry.
Drinkability suffers both from the extreme tartness and the hefty price tag, though it is remarkable nonetheless.
I think I will not be buying much more of this beer. It is interesting and sour to be sure but not so much to my liking.

Thanks to sleepydave for dropping off this brew! After popping a Confluence the other night I was feeling a bit nervous about this one as well. At least I got the cage off this time before shooting the cap across the room. The bottle foamed up a bit, but I had two wine glasses ready to go, so no problem.
Pours a slightly hazy, orange-cherry color with a slick, thin, white head across the top. Leaves some pretty lacing down the glass.
Lots of sweet and sour cherries on the nose. The pinot noir character comes out as well, giving a the cherries a slightly vinous touch. Further swirling of the glass pulls out subtle oak notes, adding some nice complexity to the aroma. Besides the sour cherries there's not too much funkiness going on. Pretty clean.
Mmm... nice tart cherries wash over the tongue right away and eventually trail off into a dry, sour, finish. Vinegar notes mixed with wine, but still overshadowed by the cherries. Malts are fairly crisp and clean. The oak barrels come through nicely, adding just a touch of refined woodiness and traces of vanilla. The more I sip, the more this beer reveals. A very well crafted flavor.
Mouthfeel is a bit foamy, with champagne like carbonation. A slight bit of acidity, but not too much. Body is pretty good for an American wild, but not quite at same level as many of the Cantillon offerings.
Drinkability is good. Lots of tartness and cherry flavor. I could definitely enjoy a 375ml bottle by myself. I think if the body were a bit less foamy I could enjoy even more, but it's still goes down pretty easy. A beer that is meant to be sipped and savored.
Overall, this is my first Russian River sour out of the bottle and I'm finding it to be pretty awesome. Lots of cherry, nicely complex, this beer is a great example of the American wild style. My only real complaint is that I don't have a few to age in my cellar. Keep up the great work Russian River! 1,930 characterssisuspeed, Mar 19, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I was very excited to split this with my dad. He loved Iron Hill's Barrel Aged Permanent Midnight, another sour beer aged in wine barrels. If he loved IH's I reasoned, surely this would knock his socks off. Sadly this wasn't the case. Too sour for his liking, he said. Oh well, on to what really matters, my opinion.
a: This is a dark golden color with some amber highlights. It poured with a small fizzy head. 
s: I should just give up trying to describe sour beers, I just can't find the adjectives that seem to fit. I smell sour cherries that seem to have some floral qualities. I also got wine aromas blanketed by prickly mustiness. As woefully inadequate as it is, that is the best I can do. 
t: Incredibly tart without quite becoming obnoxious. Dry overall, while managing to have a little underlying sweetness. Just a hint though. Tastes like red wine saturated with sour cherries. Here again, I just don't have the ability to describe what I'm tasting. I just know I love it.
m: The carbonation is on the gentle side. This has a looong tart finish.
d: Well, my dad looks like he is trying out for a Rolling Rock commercial. He just doesn't like it. For me though, I'm glad I was able to purchase and consume a bottle before the PLCB got ahold of it. Russian River continues to astound me. 1,301 charactersDIM, Mar 18, 2010

We prepared for a gusher by opening it over the sink...but it wasn't so bad. It pours a really nice, dark red color with good clarity. The color is really bright and inviting. A newsprint white head forms but quickly turns to great lacing in my tulip, with a few islands of foam.
The nose is sour with a bit of funk and mustiness. There's some nice, dark fruit in there, some fruit punch, and sour cherries. It's fruity, complex, and very inviting. The taste is earthy and fruity with a big cherry flavor. It reminds me of cherry flavored sour candy. There's also some citric lemon mixing in with all the fruitiness. The finish is a little tannic with an earthy, tea like flavor.
The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, a bit more would have been good. The finish has a bit of a puckering tannic feeling to go with the acidity. This was a great beer that I will try and have again. Splitting this bottle is ideal. 964 charactersjeffthecheff, Mar 16, 2010

Appearance- A reddish chestnut. It appears brown, but glows a warm, deep ruby when held to the light. Half inch of head with some nice big bubbles. Slightly off-white.
Smell- Very nice. The cherry comes through, without a doubt. Sour, old cherries. A nice funky farmyard. There is a strong vinegar note that is sharp on the nose. The wood comes through as well. Good stuff all around.
Taste- The cherry comes through immediately. There is plenty of wood as well. It finishes wonderfully tart. Would like a little bit more of that funky goodness. That sharp sour note really gets the salivary glands going, so I'm literally drooling over this one. The acidity on this one is no joke. 
Mouthfeel- Great carbonation. Nice and bubbly on the tongue. Good body. Very nice.
Drinkability- So tart it's a little tough, but I'd love another one. Still, the acidity is near overwhelming. Tums, please.
Another knockout from Russian River. I just can't get enough of their beers. May not like it quite as much as Consecration, but everyone is a winner in that comparison. 1,209 characterscallmescraps, Mar 15, 2010

The smell itself hurts my jaw and the sourness has a great bite but is not the most hardcore I've ever had. Instead it's just perfect for continued drinking. Cherries, pinot, and oak flavors dominate. The drinkability is truly exceptional. One of the best wild ales I've ever had. 388 characterssquaremile, Mar 14, 2010

A - Pours an amber color with about a half an inch of tan head with tons of carbonation and some decent lacing on the glass.
S - Super nice oak aroma with some bright cherry juice and a great sour funk to it.
T - Super bright sour cherry taste with phenomenal sourness.
M - Medium bodied with sharp carbonation, better mouthfeel than I thought it would have.

4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 001 375ml. corked, caged, and taped bottle with the most stubborn cork I have ever come across... poured into a tulip. Shared with schen9303. 
A: Standard pour yields a 2 finger coarse white head with great retention. Beer is a cloudy reddish clay color. Lacing is minimal, spotty in parts with very little cling. 
S: Sweet and sour cherries, wood, farmhouse funk, with a subtle vinegar. Smells exactly like it should with moderate power. 
T: Wood, vinegar, this one will burn a hole in your stomach. Very acidic, cherry flavor is present. Dissipates slightly towards the middle where booze becomes a bit more apparent. Woody and funky in the finish. Woodiness as an extremely unique aftertaste. Sweeter as it warms with a steadily creeping cherry candy flavor. 
M: Light bodied, not overly coarse, but quite carbonated. Watery in the mouth and surprisingly not dry. Finish lingers a bit and is very unique and pleasant, begging me to go back for more. 
D: Good complexity here though not overly so. What does it for me with this beer is the body. Amazingly light, invigorating, and drinkable, it complements the flavors present perfectly. Oddly filling also considering the light body, it exhausts and puzzles my palate. I could have glass after glass of this one though. Definitely worth seeking out and trying if you get a chance! 1,344 charactersSpeedwayJim, Mar 14, 2010

A- Pours a garnet hue with a thin white head.
S-Acidic, tart cherries, oak and soil are also present.
T-Follows the nose with acidic, tart cherries, some vanilla and that clay-like characteristic is there again.
M-Effervescent and thin bodied.
D-Pretty easy drinking for the style and way too close to call between this and Temptation. It's a coin flip situation to determine which is better. 511 characterssamie85, Mar 13, 2010

Poured into a Duvel Tulip. Amber with hints of ruby. 1 finger, white head that faded to a thin layer quickly.
Smell had good amount of oak and a nice presence of tart, dark cherries and some acidity.
Taste had good hints of oak. Nice acidity in the finish. Great amount of tartness and dark cherry flavor. Some great puckering that hits you in the back of your cheeks.
Mouthfeel was light body and very dry. High carbonation.
Drinkability was great. Seriously sucks that the bottle was so small. Even with the tartness it was still very drinkable.
Overall, this was very close to Consecration, but some extra tartness and oak presence. 660 charactersriored4v, Mar 11, 2010

Pours a nice dark amber. Very carbonated. Pour left a 3 finger head that was off white with a hint of orange color to it. Lacing is incredible and head lasted until the last drop
The aroma is kind of funky. Almost musty. Not really picking up on any cherry notes specifically but am getting some fruit notes, more along the lines of red wine.
WOW! Love it. Taste immediately reminds me of red wine. Tart and sweet. Slight hint of heat towards the end. Still not picking up much cherry.
Mouthfeel is dry and carbonated. Pleasant.
To sum this beer up, it's like beer, wine, and champagne all in one. I have to believe it is truly one of a kind. I hope I am able to get my hands on this again sometime soon. 739 characterspwoody11, Mar 09, 2010

A: Pours into the glass a brown color with reddish tint that lead to just a thin layer of white bubbles
S: Smells lightly funky, lactic scent, tart cherries, light oakiness
T: Very similar to the smell - sour cherries, light oakiness, lactic acid and some minimal funk
M: Highly carbonated and almost too much so if you ask me that makes this really full bodied
D: Surprisingly, even though I'm not a big fan of sours yet, I am liking this beer the more sips I take. I guess that's just getting used to the style. I wouldn't drink a ton of this, but it's a nice change from the usual beers to sip on for an occasion. 730 charactersdukedevil0, Mar 08, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Received this bottle from a great California trader, Arbitrator, who hooked me up for the recent release. Bottle is batch 04x5. Had this one other time from a different batch on tap at my first GABF and loved it. Interested to see how it differs from a bottle.
Appearance- Pours a translucent shade of darkish amber into my snifter and comes out of the bottle with about a finger of slightly off-white head. Massive amounts of beading up the side of my glass as I drink and the head dies back rather slowly into a fairly dense sheet across the top of the beer. What gets this beer particularly high marks in the looks department from me is the lacing. For a barrel-aged sour, this beer leaves a tremendous amount of lacing as I drink. Really looks nice in the glass.
Smell- Wow, very tart with lots and lots of oak coming through. Right up front, you get a whiff of that lactic tartness that is tinted with a cherry fruitiness and perhaps just a touch of barnyard funk. After that comes the wood, which mixes very nicely with the tartness and slight fruitiness. Smells great.
Taste- Very very complex. Up front, I get the fruity, cherry tartness. Mixed in with this is the oak, a woody pithiness, and some iron. For me, this drinks amazingly like a complex Flanders red ale. Possibly the best integrated, most flavorful Russian River that I've had (though I have yet to be disappointed). Really like this one.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and has a good deal of body for the style. Being a sourhead, the well integrated flavors and overall high quality of this brew really put the drinkability off the charts.
Overall, an outstanding sour. I really like this and it is probably my favorite Russian River to date (out of Consecration and Temptation). Get ahold of this one. 1,801 charactersboatshoes, Mar 08, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Recent batch sent to me by one of BA's best traders and all-around good guys - ipa247.
Popped this 375 bottle and it sounds like a small firecracker on July 4th. Loud pop with wispy cloud.
A - Made sure to not be too aggressive with the pour as I have read reviews that it is a bit of a gusher. Ruby color red with a large pillow of white immediately upon pour. As you work your way through the glass, significant retention on the glass. Very impressive.
S & T - Cherry and oak dominate this beer with a measurable amount of funk but not over the top. The taste is just about perfect. Beautiful tart sour cherry and oak combine to make this a world class beer. Not face puckering by any means. If you are a not a huge fan of sours, this is the beer for you. As soon as I started drinking it, I became sad knowing that I was killing off one of the bottles.
M & D - Very nice, but I dinged it just a bit not knowing how much of this I could actually drink. One 375 bottle was more than enough for me.
I always liked Temptation, but this one is now my favorite in an impressive lineup of RR beers. I need to get more of this, because it is a beer that I would like to have whenever the desire is there. Really top notch.

T: Tastes of sweet roasted malts, big cherry flavors mixed with oak notes, a big sour almost citrus-y sour finishes this one off.

The delicate aroma consists of cherry, oak and a light barnyard funk.
The taste is even better. One again cherries play the leading role, the oak the supporting cast (cask?), and the barnyard funk is there in the finish along with a bit of lemon. A near perfect blend and extremely delicious.
The mouthfeel is smooth, rich and with a slightly dry finish.

First sip is a burst of sourness followed by cherry finish, then complexity builds. Gets lemony, and increasingly creamy, but definitely has a peppery and earthy side. Finishes very dry. Towards the end of the bottle, I got the exact taste of slightly tannic green tea with honey.
Has a very dry sourness.

4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 04x5, poured into a Cantillon glass.
A - Tawny deep copper/brown color. It pours with a thin head that sticks around for the entirety of the beer. some thin lacing crawls down the glass.
S - Tart cherries and wood. There is a slight vinegar nose but nothing out of control. The beer smells like a cherry lover's dream.
T - Brown style ale lends a good base here, as there is a roasty malt flavor and even a little hint of hops. But you'll have to dig for those flavors, since the tartness and cherry are the most present notes here. Again, this is well balanced, and not too sweet or tart; the biggest advantage the beer has is this restraint and balance.
M / D - The mouthfeel is exceptional; crisp and refreshing. As for drinkability? I could have a couple of these a night. If only they were easier to find!
All in all, it's another amazing beer from RR! 868 charactersmutterfudder, Mar 03, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 410oz pour at Monk's Cafe. While I noticed some marked differences between this and the batch 3 bottle I had last year, I wasn't aware that I was drinking Batch 1 (4.5 years old) until later in the afternoon. Especially with all of the talk that batch 4 is very pungently cherried, I assumed I was having delusions or that Younger had wrecked my palate, neither of which is true.
A- Pours a brownish amber with 1-finger of off white head, which is very spritzy and dissipated quickly leaving sticky, streaky lacing.
S- Huge lactic character with a slightly vinegary aroma (which is much more pronounced that I remember from the fresher bottle I sampled.) I wrote in my notes that I got no cherry whatsoever in the nose, due to the overpowering lactic sourness and this makes perfect sense in retrospect. The old wood and vinegar that followed the sourness are much more welcome with the knowledge that this beer had been aged for 4.5 years. 
T- Initially, I get an ever-so-slight fruitness, which I wouldn't even single out as cherries except for the fact that I know this beer is aged with cherries. The Pinot Noir barrels may play a role in this initial fruiting as well. The fruit immediately gives way to the huge lacto sourness I have already alluded to in the smell category. In the finish, I get a lot of the vinegar flavor, which is much more intertwined with the woodiness and marked leathery flavors making it much more enjoyable than in the nose.
MF- Spritzy mouthfeel with a medium body. The fresh consecration I sampled right after this was slightly syrupy for my liking, but this was pretty much the perfect viscosity for this beer. 
D- Slightly more acidic that I would like to the point where it had a burn that was slightly more on the esophagus than most any sour I have tasted. This is not to say that it was more sour or worse, it just burned a little. Other than that one downside, however, the beer was extremely drinkable and has held up VERY nicely. 1,977 charactersmbudner, Mar 02, 2010
4.48/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a very cloudy deep orange-brown with a tiny head and some slippery lacing.
The smell is sweet with rich malty notes that are quickly put in check by a cherry infused sourness that is all but overwhelming in the nose. 
Hints of vinegar and loads of sour cherries. Champagne like dryness supplemented by sour green apples and nuances of oak barrel. Strong vinous tannins remind me of a good north coast Pinot Noir. A fine wine of a brew.
The mouthfeel is light and aggressively carbonated. Coating and dry.

4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A wonderful cherry beer with the background of must, funk, sour, and dryness.
Supplication begins with a deep redish-brown color, boardering on rust with it's medium haze. An off white head forms above the beer and soon settles to an intermitten blanket of foam with solid lacing. A fine looking beer indeed.
Very tart, musty, horsey, and sharply of lime and vinegar-like to the nose. Bold cherry aromas take center stage and in tart and under-ripe versions. Amber malts begin to temper the acidic notes with light breads and toast. Slight phenolics give a bit of medecine notes to go along with peppery scent. As with most Belgian Lambics, the aroma promises serious complexity, strength, and depth... let's see.
Crazy intense flavors of tart cherries hold center stage and push the yeast and malt character way down. Cherry notes are complimented by lemons, limes, apples, cranberries, and crab-apples. Funky vinous notes of cider, red-wine or balsamic vingar, musty-dusty earthiness, and aged woods give a lot of flavor and help to intensify the character of the cherry fruits. A salty, minerally flavor also amplifies the sharp flavors quite a bit. Softer malts pad the impact of the yeast and fruit agains the tongue with just enough bread crust and toffee sweetness to remind me that this is indeed a beer.
Acrid, astringent, and mouth puckering up front but the beer holds enough maltiness to give it a bit of cushion on the back side that allows for dryness but not an insatiable astringency. This gives a great clean lactic quality that erases the enamel from the teeth but keeps from the burn in the throat.
This is a delicious beer. With that extra mild malty finish the beer has a more inviting flavor and mouthfeel than say another great sour in Drie Fonteinen fruit sours.
Thanks waltonc, bbehr! 1,815 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 01, 2010

A - after the cork pop, foam started to slowly rie out of the glass, stopping just short of spilling over (and wasting a few drops), a good omen as the beer gods must be watching this one. poured about an inch and a half of tight pillowy and frothy, very light tan foam. leaves a thin layer of webbed lacing around the glass as it slowly falls. the beer is a very hazy, dark gold/orange color. 
S - this one hit my nose as soon as i got the cork off...noticing some oak right away. big whiffs of belgian yeast, some sour lemon/green apple and ample tartness. sweetness comes in the form of cherries, oak, vanilla. 
T - flavor explodes in the mouth at each sip, tons of sour and tart cherries, turns mouth watering and puckering before more subtle stuff comes through, oak, vanilla, brett...sweet malt underneath carries throughout. outstanding balance and development from sour, to tart, to funk, to acidic, to sweet. some time settling brings out some more funk and a slight pepperyness also some toasted nuts out of nowhere. beers like this still blow my mind with displays of what strains of yeast are capable of. 
M - this is everything a Wild Ale should be...healthy amount of tight carbonation that is just spot on, not distracting and aids to delivering a myriad of flavors to all corners of the mouth. ample creaminess is sufficient enough to fight through massively puckering tart/sour. 
D - a beer like this just begs to be slowly sipped and savored, the problem is its just so damn delicious and balanced. the alcohol is simply non-existent, and balance just unbelievable. sitting and settling for a few minutes brings out a whole new slew of tastes and textures. certainly holds its own against other RR sours/wilds. 1,855 charactersStigs, Mar 01, 2010

A: Pours a hazy orange/amber color. Produces a finger of brownish white head that recedes quickly leaving some faint lacing.
S: I think this may be the most aromatic beer I have had to date. Vanilla and cherry up front. Some oak and spiciness in the background.
T: Tart cherries and currants take the forefront here. Some oak and spices (cinnamon maybe?) are present as well. 
M: Medium/full bodied brew with a clean finish. The finish is surprising considering how sour this is, after a second or two its like it was never there.
D: I will admit I am not a fan of the style but had to try this due to the hype. The sourness was a shock at first; however, after a few sips it all came together and I could easily see how fans of sours could crush this and beg for more. 843 charactersalli4051, Feb 28, 2010

Pouring slowly into the wine glass, trying to keep sediment and yeast in the bottle, Supplication pours a hazy redish brown color with thick white head. There is a lot of activity in this beer with tiny flecks of suspended yeast. The head settles very slowly with spotty lace left behind.
Aroma is wonderful and full of sour cherries and tart cranberrier. In fact, as soon as the cork came loose, the smell of sour funk was is the air. It's not overpowering but it's a very prominant aspect of the beer.
Flavor is suitably intense. Sweet and sour, tart and bitter, all in balance. Reminds me very much of Consecration in that respect. So much flavor but all in unison. The cherries are probably the most forward of flavors but, as noticed in the nose, cranberries are there as well. The brown ale base is not completely lost but I would be interested to try it alone without the addition of wild yeast and barrel aging. Some toasty malt and caramel come through but it's certainly overwhelmed by the conditioning.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Lots of flavor, especially sour, and the alcohol is not too strong.
Overall another great beer from Russian River. If I could afford it, I would love to try Supplication, Consecration, and Temptation in a side-by-side sour tasting. Without trying the latter yet, I have high expectations after trying the other two. 1,434 charactersGilGarp, Feb 28, 2010

Poured into an oversized wine glass. Great copper color with a minimal beige head that didn't last long. Minor lacing down the glass. Smells great, big burst of cherries, wood and some funkiness. The taste is where this beer really shines in my book. It's dominated by cherries with a great sourness but nothing over the top. Very, very delicious beer. I felt like I was flying through this beer so I had to slow myself down to really enjoy it. Mouthfeel is excellent as well. The carbonation is spot on and it has a sort of champagne quality that coast your tongue. Drinkability is off the charts in my opinion. Feel like I could sip on this all day long. Temptation and consecration were very good but I think supplication is my favorite of the 3. I will get more, highly recommended. 839 charactersgibby, Feb 27, 2010

Smell is of a fine wine with a beer twist ending. All cherry and tart upfront but there are some toasted malt notes in it.Subtle fruity yeasty aroma's as well. Different but yet intriguing.
Taste is well EVIL. Am I sure that this is beer? Ridiculous tartiness with a nice punch of sour cherry.There is a a linger in the end of a bready maltiness.
Mouth is full bodied with a champagne bubbliness that never settles completely. Tart feel completely numbs the palate and makes the tongue slap against the roof of my mouth a few times after each sip.
Although I don't think this is a session type beer it surely is one of the best tasting beers out there. A must try for everyone who enjoys unique beer. 822 charactersTheFightfan1, Feb 27, 2010

The smell is a bit sour and fruity with some nice white grape and some light apple. There is some hints of wet leather and candy apple.
The taste is a bit tart with some light fruit flavor and a really nice spicy hop flavor. There is a really nice green apple flavor that is really sweet. It has some an interesting Hawaiian punch flavor as well that is in back of this apple skin, granny smith flavor. It brings back memories of jolly rancher candies. Some nice sugary sweet flavor

Started rising out of the bottle as the cork was popped. Poured with a massive 4f of chunky off white head, over top of a deep amber body - plenty of visible carbonation. Good lacing.
Overall aroma was not overpowering, but was really top notch for a 'wild ale'. Plenty of oak barrel to start, followed by rich, dark fruit skins, gym sneakers, some red twizzler sweetness, and a bit of cinnamon hiding out in the back.
Tart, nearly puckering at the onset - flavor was full of brett and cherry skins, with lesser levels of acidic / lemon juice and bready/yeasty goodness. Phenomenal carbonation balance, creating a smooth slide over the tongue, with dry, tight finish.
This is really hard to just let sit in the glass... it constantly pulls you back, leaving you quickly wishing there were 5 more of it's sibblings waiting for you in the fridge. But that would be an expensive 6 pack now, wouldn't it. 940 charactersBeerImmediately, Feb 26, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a dark copper hue with some ruby highlights. There is a cream colored head that lasts a long time and leaves thin scattered lacing on the glass.
Smell is a mixture of balsamic vinegar, tart cherries, grapes, and some alcohol sweetness.
Taste is of sweet cherries upfront, but a quick in your face sour funk sweeps. A dry woody finish mellows things out. The sour creeps up hard but it balances away very nicely.
Drinkability is good as it is not too sour or overwhelming. Alcohol is not very present. Mouthfeel is creamy and coats the whole palate. Another good sour from RR. 584 characterssnpub540, Feb 25, 2010
4.21/5  rDev -6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Grabbed a couple 350ml bottles at Beaumont Market yesterday shortly after Justin posted this special release on Facebook.
- Clear straw yellow with lots of bubbles keeping a forever lasting smooth blanket of foam on top... about as pinky fingers depth. Bottle had opened with a healthy pop.. and it is kind of fun watching all the bubbles on the side of the tumbler glass I used.
- Nice tart sourness of front, and underneath is a nice blend of white grape, zesty hops.. and a noticeable brown ale-like malt sweetness... bit of oak and not too much cherry.. unless it is adding to the tartness.
- Wonderful flavors... and I really let this sit around awhile and get warm so all the flavors would come out to play. Zesty sour white grape-like notes for me... a background of currants, oak, and sweet roasted grain and molasses. Hops were there and present... blended perfectly and oh so subtle.... fantastic.
- This is where my judging of this brew drops a bit. It was a thin bodied brew.. perfectly tart and mouth watering... but I though much over carbonated. It would almost be worth letting it sit out a long time to just settle down... what a live beast of a brew.
- Overall I really liked this, and I plan on sitting on others for a long time to see what can happen to this brew, and if the carbonation would calm down a bit. Overall very good. Would still buy Consecration before this one though. Even Temptation too I think.... but either way, I will buy all of them. Love each and every one of them. 1,512 charactersDocer, Feb 25, 2010

Pours a ruby/orangish color with smooth creamy one finger head. Head dissapates quickly but remains a layer of cream. Appears to leave thick bubbly lacing.
Aroma is wonderful. Full of tart cherries...obviously. Citrus and brett...no booze in the nose at all. Slight vinegar aroma, overall though, my mouth is watering!
It's a pucker! Solid sour...tons of fermented cherries, carbonation...and very crisp. I guess I should mention I chose to pour slowly at first, and then swirled the setiment and poured in into my glass anyway. I personally love the added flavor. There's a very nice sweet flavor that rests on the tongue well after each sip. A great sour! 763 charactersShadesOfGray, Feb 25, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy orange tea color with a thick stiff foamy white head that resists fading, leaving a huge amount of Belgian lacing, some 3D. The smell is aggressive, complex and fruity classic Bing cherries down to the unique tart character. The aroma also has a sweetness that i want to associate with malt but with a creamy vanilla note that i sense may be from the barrel aging. Full flavored, the tart cherry character is intense without being offensive and in fact is exceptional. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel finishes clean and dry. This is the most drinkable sour that I've experienced...right up there with Brute and LeBleu. The depth of the flavors and aroma of this one exceeds the other two. Really glad that I had the opportunity to consider it! 763 charactersjjayjaye, Feb 25, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle (batch 04x3) received in trade from Nanoslug - Thanks! Poured into a Russian River Belgian stemmed glass.
A - Cork comes out with a nice pop and a small rush of trapped CO2. Pours a clear, nice light amber color with an overall pinkish hue to it...somewhat reminiscent of unblended cranberry juice. A thick two fingered pillow of cream colored (again with a slight pinkish tint) foam rests on top and shows absolutely no sign of going anywhere. An endless stream of carbonation bubbles rises through the glass giving a champagne impression. Very pretty wild ale.
S - When I popped the cork, I took a quick smell and my immediate impression was...Canada Dry gingerale?...I love this smell so we are off to a good start - although this is not what I was expecting to get. Upon closer inspection I still get a gingerale'y effect, but with more going on as well. Some good lactic sourness and really get the cherries coming thru too. Really nice blend of aromas. Also, as I come back for more, really start to get the brett funk coming out - spicy, horseblankety, tart. Excellent!
T - Not overly sour or tart in the spirit of Beatification, although there are plenty of sour flavors here. Plenty of lactic acid up front. Fruity overall, sour cherries, (still getting gingerale too), pinot grigio, some oaky woodiness, plenty of brett character - quite funky overall. Very enjoyable.
M - Carbonation is characteristically high but has a bit of a creaminess to it. Body is thin, but a bit fuller than I expected and fuller than most wilds I've had. Lactic sourness fills the mouth and gives a drying and slightly puckering sensation, but really feels pretty refreshing overall. Again, quite good.
D - Hmm, very good wild ale...really a toss up between this and Consecration for my favorite RR wild, and up there overall, probably adding Ithaca Brute into the mix. Good blend of fruitiness, sour, brett...sorry that this is only a 375ml bottle...have to try to get a few more of these before they become scarce. 2,022 charactersportia99, Feb 25, 2010

I've been enjoying the hell out of this beer since its release, so I thought it was time to review it. Bottled batch 004. The beer appears deep orange tinged ruby with a voluminous light beige head, excellent retention, and lots of scattered lacing.
The nose is redolent of tart cherries and lactic character, with a balancing sweet malt presence and apparent wood notes. The fruit is incredibly vibrant, a moderate acetic character is evident, and vanilla is subtle.
The flavor opens with tart cherry flesh and skins, segueing into a moderate lactic sourness and a slightly balancing malty sweetness. Acetic acid character is at a pleasantly restrained lower moderate level, adding balance rather than churning my stomach. Other fruit notes are of grapes and plums, but cherries are most prominent. The finish is tart and lightly tannic with a plethora of fruit and a drying woody sensation. Outstanding. The mouthfeel is dry and soft, with a fitting moderate level of carbonation.
I consumed a growler of batch 004 back in December, but I've been told that a different blend was put into bottles. I enjoy this even more than the first blend, if that's possible, and I shall drink up while the fruit is fresh. 1,224 charactersHopHead84, Feb 24, 2010

Batch four has a really vivid cherry character right now, wth a ton of acidity, but also a great mLt balance that isn't sweet but provides a lot of counterbalance to the sourness. Just a ton of great flavor. Seems more fruit forward than the last batch. I can't. Wait to see how the bottles of this batch are. 357 charactersbulletrain76, Feb 24, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bought a 375mL bottle at Capone's...needed to try this before committing to a case. Batch 04x1 poured from the corked and caged bottle into my Troegs pint glass.
Appearance: Small off-white head on top of a copper colored beer with a reddish hue to it. Lots of active carbonation bubbles steaming up the sides of the glass. Slightly hazy. Real solid lacing.
Smell: A lot of pinot noir wine barrel in the nose. Hints of cherry and some tartness and funk in the background. Mild earthy aroma, but pretty sweet. Very complex nose on this one.
Taste: Very interesting. Kind of a sweet funkiness on the back of my tongue with a good amount of those pinot noir barrel and cherry flavors coming through. Not very sweet at all, just mild amounts from the cherry and oak. Finishes with a good sour bite and leaves tart cherry flavors behind.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Very refreshing despite its acidity. Sour kick in the back end gives it great balance.
Drinkability: High for a sour. The ABV is not oppressive and its smooth and balanced nature make it easy on the palate.
Very good sour. Perhaps not as good as Temptation in my mind (which is just phenomenal) but a very solid offering worthy of the price (whatever it may be). 1,250 charactersEzekiel81923, Feb 23, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This was one of the highlights of EBF 2010 for me. 
A: Pours a bright golden yellow with lots of carbonation bubbles flying to the surface. A smallish white head sits atop the brew for the majority of the experience. Not much in the way of lacing. 
S: As with most sours, I have trouble picking out individual aromas from this. The typical "sour" aroma from the wild yeast and bacteria is of course present. This is balanced by some sweet aromas. Apple is my best guess, mixed with perhaps some white grapes. I don't really get any cherry on the nose. 
T: Truly a pleasure to drink. Sour apple dominates the flavor and great balance is achieved between the sweet fruit and sour funk/wild yeast. Each sip brings me to the brink of puckering, but touches of sweetness always prevent me from going over the edge. White grapes and pear can also be found in the flavor. 
M: Light with a nice dry finish. Just like it should be. 
D: I could drink this all day... and I did! Russian River seemed to have an endless supply of this stuff during both NoTB and session one. I came back from multiple samples :) 1,104 charactersMrDanno96, Feb 23, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A huge thanks to tjmodica for the trade.
A: Pours a slightly hazy garnet/red color. A large white head rises to about two fingers. There is good retention, and some sticky lace is left behind.
S: Tart cherries up front and dominate. Lots of other fruity aromas. Grapes, plums, and apples are what I get. A sweet vanilla aroma as well. Lots of complexities in the nose. Excellent.
T: Again, excellent. There is a tartness with a vinous character up front. A light funk, but not overdone at all. Tons of cherries, grape tannins, and apple skins. Again, a sweet vanilla flavor lingers. Could that be the barrels used? Really well made.
M/D: A medium body and carbonation. Crisp and dry. Smooth, and way to easy to drink. I wish this bottle would never end.
Yep, an excellent beer throughout. I would expect nothing less from a Russian River Wild Ale. Maybe the best I have had from the brewery, which is saying a lot. Worthy of its praise. A must try if you have the means. 972 characterschamp103, Feb 23, 2010

Aroma is sweeter than I was expecting for sure. There is also a funky spiciness to the whole thing. I'm interested for sure. What's going to happen next.
OK, I like this beer but this is not my favorite sour, not at all. This was sweet and there is a lot of carbonation in the mouth that accents the sour notes. It ends rather tart but overall its not as sour as the other offerings. Its citric and lactic in nature with a pretty dominant sweetness overall. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is high. Still a great beer. 716 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 22, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sent to me from my favorite relatives in San Francisco... Thanks Nor!
Poured from a 375ml bottle into a New Belgium globe.
The aroma is filled with sour cherries, some malt sweetness, and a little bit of hay. The beer pours out a tannish red color with a thin but long lasting off-white head that leaves lacing along the glass.
The swallow begins with sweet malt and cherries, and is quickly followed at the mid-point with aggressively sour cherries and a touch of oak, and then finishes dry with a soft wheaty, saltine-like flavor that lingers for a few moments.
The mouthfeel is medium with a high level of carbonation. This is a very drinkable sour beer with lots of complexity. A real treat. 699 characterswestweasel, Feb 22, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a wine glass. I feel pretty privileged to be reviewing a beer with 803 wants as of this writing. Small bottle, corked and caged. Minor foam upon pouring, but it retains very well, I find. Clear brown. 
It has that sour aroma that makes the palate pucker up immediately. Concentrated Sweet-Tarts. Boiled-down Nerds. Lemonheads. The smell of every sour candy I can think of is in here. Some cherry and wood - smells Cantillon-esque. Almost a birch syrup aroma as it warms, I think. 
This has excellent flavor. Moderately sour, with just a little apple and cherry, (and I swear some of that birch syrup!) sweetness to set it off. In fact, the more I drink, the less "sour" I notice, and the more I notice a vanilla-cinnamon-birch thing going on. Who knows exactly what the pinot noir barrels did to this - that's probably what I'm tasting. Odd. But exceedingly tasty. 
It has a spiky, bright mouthfeel similar to many very good lambics.
It's a given that you will wish this had come in 750s. It's a fun beer to drink, and comparable in quality to the best Belgian lambics, I have no doubt of that. 1,110 charactersPatrick999, Feb 22, 2010
4.19/5  rDev -6.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A prayer to a deity to provide something, what? Pours a murky dark amber color almost boarder line brown. A soft pour did not leave much for a head. Not much on retention or lacing either.
The nose is complex. Some soft malt character with a hint of sourness. A very light subtle fruit aroma with a hint of cherry. Don't know if I would be able to pick it out if I didn't read it on the bottle. Some minor horse blanket but would have liked a touch more. Some oaky note on the back end. Some yeasty notes but kind of hidden with everything going on.
The taste is representative overall. The first taste is a light malt followed quickly by a tart taste with a lemon cherry mix. The tart taste lingers into the finish but blends well. The cherries note is light but hints are there. Some nice sour notes that come out but make way for a funk in the finish. Some leather and horse blanket notes. Some minor butyric notes and a touch of oak notes. Light vanilla. Good acidic finish.
The body is light to moderate. Limited carbonation but ok. The tartness leaves a good finish that really helps. But I would like a bit more complexity. 1,133 charactersOxymoron, Feb 22, 2010

375 mL cage and corked bottle from batch 04x4 poured into a tulip glass. 
The Supplication pours a hazy amber color. A nice frothy 2 finger head with great retention sits atop after a very delicate pour. The aromas were noticed immediately after popping the top. Lots of cherries make up the sweetness that dominated the nose. Some grapes are also noticed most likely from the wine barrels that are used during the aging. After allowing the brew to warm up from the 45 degree fridge shelf the first quaff was taken. The mouth is not nearly as sweet as the nose with a very balanced sour tartness. Not a lip smacker like some sour ales can be. Again, lots of cherries are tasted up front. Other fruits that make up the quaff are pinot noir grapes and plums. The brett also come through with the quaff which is expected. Mouthfeel is crisp and well carbonated, much like a champagne. This is by far the best sour I have sampled. Very fortunate to have tried this brew and can only imagine how it tastes with a year or two on the shelf. Thanks again Jesse for allowing me to try it. 1,155 charactersabrand, Feb 21, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: Pours a slightly hazy amber with some golden hues on the edges when held up to the light, capped by a two finger cream colored head with great retention that leaves tight lacing down the side of the glass. Beautiful.
S: Sour cherries up front with a lot of complexity backing it up - vinous characteristics, some oakiness, a hint of yeasty aroma, a bit of funk (although there's more sour aspects than funk), earthiness that could be from the hops or the funk. Every whiff reveals a slightly different balance of the components.
T: More tartness than the aroma lets on, but far from overpowering. Sour cherries are the first taste, giving way to oaky notes, grapes, some funk poking out from behind the sourness on the backend, even a bit of leather. All of it is backed up by a slight caramel malty aspect. Strongly sour, but balanced in the sense that it doesn't hide the complexity of everything going on in this beer.
M: Good medium carbonation and a smooth feel balance the mouth-puckering sourness. High in acidity but remarkably refreshing.
D: If not for price and rarity, I could drink this like water...and that's only a slight exaggeration. An amazing beer, and I can't wait to see how it evolves over the next couple years. 1,241 charactersXul, Feb 21, 2010
4/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Pours a surprisingly dark and malty, hazy ruby copper with a smallish light tan head that recedes at a slightly slower than normal pace to a thin fiml of microbubbles.
S - A pretty sour cherry kick in the nose that gets stronger as it warms. Only hints of funk with a slight vinegar character, a tad musty. 
T - Sour sun-turned cherries, lime, and lemon zest. Oak has rounded this beer nicely. The barnyard indeed comes out here too as it warms, but never too much. 
M - A little heavy for the style, but the relatively high carbonation helps to create a nice balance. 
D - This brew is delicious, but far from the most complex sour I've had. It's a kriek alright, but not much more. I would seek out again, but wouldn't go too far to get it. 750 charactersNYCWheatFanSC, Feb 21, 2010

Appearance: Pours a caramel copper with honey bursts and red folds. The crown is white, billowy soft, about 1.5 fingers, shows some retention and serious lace.
Smell: Very soft and delicate yeast, cherries, white grapes, lightly toasted oak and leather.
Taste: Lots of cherries, white grapes, and some lemony brett. Moderate pucker and sourness but quite tart and acidic!
Mouthfeel: light bodied with velvety small carbonation.

Appearance: deep, woody amber color with a finger of compact tan head. Looks good enough to eat. There is a very nice lacing left on the glass as I drink.
Smell: tart and woody with a little sweet malt aroma coming through. Complex and tasty smelling.
Taste: this is one tart wild ale. Flavor moves from tartness to woodiness and, finally, to the sweet fruitness of the cherries. The cherry flavor is more of a hint or suggestion, but it proves a very nice contrast to the brightness up front. The cherry lingers on the palate a good long time. This beer is quite delicious.
Mouthfeel: medium body with big carbonation. While not really creamy (it's too acidic for that), it is still a very smooth effect which I find appealing.
Drinkability: this is incredibly drinkable. Were I to win the lottery tomorrow, I'd definitely try to get my hands on a few cases of this stuff. 950 charactersflagmantho, Feb 20, 2010

A: Beautiful hazy amber color with a thin white head that settles quickly, but leaves great lacing on the glass. 
S: The cherries have diminished greatly, leaving behing the aroma of great Burgundy. Spice, forest floor, and some ripe cherry flavor is present. Hops are no longer there due to age and preservation.
T: A bit of the cherry flavor is present, but dominating flavors are tart and barnyardy, with some caramel, spice, and a big dose of oak. The finish is tart, dry, and refreshing.
M: Light, tart, and very complex, this brew dances around the tongue and leaves flavors that last almost a lifetime. 
D: If one happens to get ahold of this brew, buy it! Don't mind the cost. It's amazing, and is the pinnacle of this style. I would like to try a younger example, just to see how it compares. 879 charactersWYVYRN527, Feb 20, 2010

Fizzy white head of about an inch. Deep orange in color and similar in appearance to a glass of champagne. A nice layer of retention and great lacing.
Wild yeast, brett, white grape, melon, citrus, oak and grassy hops. A bit of musky funk to it, but certainly not the dominating aroma.
Taste is more sour than I expected with cherry and red pinot grape coming more into play. Nice oak with some musk and brett; certainly let you know they are in there, but again, not overpowering.
Mouth is vinous, dry and astringent yet still with a crispness from the nice carbonation. Lighter bodied and a true sipper.
I still think I'm getting acclimated with these variety of ales. I respect this beer but don't think I can truly appreciate it yet. I'll be re-reviewing this in a year or so to see how my palate has changed. 940 charactersibbjamin, Feb 19, 2010

Poured into a Cigar City snifter.
Appearance: Pours out caramel-colored and oily, producing very little head. A very thin, white halo retains for the entire session, and leaves just a touch of lacing. Body is crystal clear and reddish copper. Looks nice.
Smell: Juicy lemon, blackberry tarts, cherries, and, of course, brettanomyces. Sweet and sour aromas come together beautifully! No vinegar here. Mouthwatering!
Taste: Initially sugary, but rapidly switches to sour bret. Cherries are subtle, but there. Dry esters pick up midway through, and I also get just a touch of salt. Finishes like cherry lemonade. I love the sourness, and as Wiseman Zach said (after trying this - his first sour!), "This one really grows on ya." Huge sourness. I love it! 
Mouthfeel: Delicately carbonated, dry, and tremendously sour. Lots of mouth-numbing and/or palate-wrecking. Pretty light in body though. Exactly how a wild ale should be.
Drinkability: Sadly, I only got about 4oz. of this. I would've gladly taken more. Thank you SO much Mr. Appler! This is the best sour I've had to date! 1,236 charactersThreeWiseMen, Feb 19, 2010

A- Poured into a Bruery tulip glass, Supplication pours a caramely amber color with a slightly off-white head that settles to a silky, bubbly cap over the liquid. A thick ring of foam along the inside of the glass leaves drapes of web-like lacing after each sip.
S- Wild yeast imparts the expected notes of tartness and acidity. Aromas of red wine and oak barrel rest atop a bed of lightly toasted, sweet(ish) malts. Musky tones of barnyard hay emerge as the beer warms up. 
T- The flavor is very tart at first. Notes of oak barrel, dark cherries, and caramel-brown malts make up the delicious mid palate, though the sourness accents these flavors all along the way. The finish is dry and leaves more lightly acidic tartness clinging to the inside of the mouth while bready malt notes lay on the palate. 
M- A full-bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation that feels right for this beer. The corked popped out with such force that I was expecting the beer to be over-carbonated, but the mouthfeel is perfectly balanced. 
D- This is one of the most enjoyable, drinkable beers that I've ever had. I made very short work of my 375 ML bottle and I'm sad that I only bought one. 1,188 charactersTdizzle, Feb 18, 2010

Smell - Strong scents of green apple, cherries, and an overall sour fruit aroma. You can pick up on a slight oak note as well.
Taste - Amazing sourness. Reminds me of a Warhead candy. Lots of intense sour cherries, green apple, lemon, and the end has a nice earthy balance that makes your mouth water.
Mouthfeel - Very good carbonation. It has the "pickle-effect" that makes your mouth continue to water long after you've had a drink.
Drinkability - It's very smooth considering the sourness. The acidity and carbonation help balance it out and make it a smooth drink amid the sour fruit flavors. 715 characterstturaiders, Feb 18, 2010

A- There was a huge pop when I let the cork fly. Good carbination in the glass. A nice head formed, about an inch, and it's pretty frothy and tightly nit. The glass has a lot of carbination action going on in the beer itself. A nice amber color nestles itself within my glass.
S- The sourness is there for sure. A lacto smell is there, reminds me of a cherry tums in a strange way. A nice oak smell with the presence of the pino for sure along with the sour cherry taste that floats around. Pretty complex nose. 
T- Good clean beer taste, very crisp and refreshing. The sourness sits and waits till the end to pounce and pucker the tongue. This is a sour beast, almost like sucking on sour lemons. The sourness even lingers on my teeth, gums and down my throat. My most recent taste made my eye twitch, whew. The sourness is so overwhelming that I'm not getting too much of the other flavors. But this is tasty.
M- Besides the mouth puckering sourness the carbination is totally awesome and helps this beer out a great deal. 
D- Easy to drink, but the sourness does slow down the drinking of the beer, but I want to enjoy this as it is. 1,200 charactersWetpaperbag, Feb 18, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally got this one delivered today. Poured from the new 375mL style bottle into my tulip glass.
A: Pours a copper/ruby color with a nice two-finger head that is ever-so-slightly pink. Plenty of lacing initially as the head recedes, and some nice legs as it goes down.
S: A good amount of cherry in addition to a hefty amount of lactic sourness. Some oak. The cherry itself isn't over-the-top, but is somehow soothing as I inhale. Also detecting a very modest amount of earthy funk.
T: The cherries bring this beer to a completely different level. Absolutely beautiful how they are integrated--both sweetness and tartness--with the lactic sourness of the base beer. A bit of brown malt underlying the entire brew.
M: Fairly low carbonation on a medium body. Not terribly mouth-puckering, but fairly dry with a nice acidity.
D: Very drinkable, especially considering the style. Good carbonation levels, beautiful fruit, and a beautifully-balanced sourness. 961 charactersThorpe429, Feb 18, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 4x2 poured into Chimay Glassware.
A- Hazy golden amber color with loads of carbonation that immediately dies to a small foam pool in the middle of the glass and nice fine lacing on my glass.
S- Loads of cherry, lemon, and brett right away, basically what you would expect from an American Wild, followed by some subdued sweet oak scents. Very nice balance.
T- Insane amounts of wild Brett yeast, sour cherries, lemon, green apple, with some slight acidity, followed by some nice slightly sweet oak and a nice dry finish that leaves your mouth watering.
M- Very nice acidic cherries/lemon going on but balances a nice slightly sweet oak backdrop and loads of fine carbonation throughout. Leaves you wanting more.
D- Really easy to drink a lot of this beer, undeniably refreshing. Reminds me of sour skittles(though not as sweet), they would leave me always wanting more. Best wild ale I have had, worth the cost... 924 charactersSchmaltzy, Feb 18, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark hazy cherry color with an off white colored medium sized head. Great retention on the sides of the glass. Looks damn good.
Smell is very complex, some cherry, vinegar, and a funky aroma. Many aromas exude from the glass. Way too many for me to name them all.
Tart and delicious up front. Tastes kind of like a sour patch kid without the sugar. Cherry, brett and funk come through hard core with this beauty. Everything complements each other so well, this beer is harmony in the mouth. So good, wow. You can definitely tell why they refer to it as a "sour."
Full mouthfeel with a little acidity. Terrific beer, great level of carbonation as well.
Great drinkability, I would love to sip on one of these all day long. 733 characterspmccallum86, Feb 17, 2010

A- Amber/caramel, snowy white head that drifts and builds into the tulip. Delightfully light yet rich. Looks like a snowdrift. Head is well-retained and laces like icing. Fantastic.
S- Cherries, oak, like chewing on a toothpick. Cherries are more tart than sweet. Acidic, like a good kriek/oud bruin. 
T- Brett, cherry tartness, oak, lingering but reserved acidity. In perfect harmony. Really blown away at this one. Nowhere near the powerful wallop of a Cantillon, but oh-so-drinkable. Really great interplay with the cherries, funk, and oak. 
M- Tart, acidic, but not too much. Great carbonation. Impossibly refreshing.
D- Insane. I'd drink a 3L of it if I could. Really glad I have a few more. Simply fantastic and the best Am. wild ale I've ever had. 899 charactersShogoKawada, Feb 17, 2010

-medium amber/goldish through light. okay looking white head and lacing through the experience
-if sour has a smell, this is it. can slightly pull out some fruits in there too...banana, maybe a hint of peach
-wow! this blasts the taste buds really hard and immediately. much more intense than the pour i got about a month ago. has more of a lime sourness to it than lemon. finishes with quite a banana bread taste which is nice. once it warms up it really tastes like eating a warhead in which it has a bitter, kind of dusty sourness to it. really hard to pull much else out of it
-very powerful, but still smooth somehow. carb is not overdone and it has a nice amount of dryness to it
-i am not the biggest sour beer fan out there, and this is my favorite out there by far. very drinkable for me considering the style. could definitely be excited to order this for years to come 917 charactersjuhl31, Feb 16, 2010

On Tap at Falling Rock in Denver. Been waiting to try this one, and it did not dissapoint. Little head, gives way to a nice ruby color, smelling of hay and fruit. Mouthfeel is amazing, acidity is there and cuts into it, but you really get a nice dose of the cherry. The cherry element reminds me of New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red, but the sourness creates its own unique world. What a beer, I would gladly drink this all day and all night. Thank you, Mr. Cilurzo. Thank you. 501 charactersBlackHoleBrew42, Feb 15, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 4X2. I've always been intrigued by sours, but haven't taken the plunge. I heard through my local beer scene that a few cases had made it to my neck of the woods and couldn't resist. 
Pours from 375ml bottle a brown/amber with a creamy colored cap. Foam was about 2 finger width with an abundance of lacing and long lasting retention. 
The aroma is just explosive. Tartness, grapes, cherries, and a hint of pepper. A touch of vinegar is present, but really is taken back by the fruit. 
Pungent tart and sourness up front, and gives way to cherries and and some slight yeast. Little vinegar, but it adds more to the tart notes at the front rather than the finish. Goes down crazy smooth.
Mouthfeel was medium. Sturdy enough to hold all the flavors together and just light enough to really enjoy during a session.
Drinkability is great, if sour is your bag.
PS. This is my first sour, and I really enjoyed it. I can see myself really enjoying this style more often. Thanks Russian River. 996 charactersFoxtrot, Feb 15, 2010
4.51/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Batch 003 poured from a 375 ml bottle into my Russian River tulip glass. Poured a brown/red color with about half an inch of white frothy foam on top. It kept a thin white covering on the beer as I drank it, which made each sip a little frothy and really enhanced the beer. I don't think I could ask for a better looking beer of this style.
Aroma is sour and tart with some grape, cherry and sour candy apple flavors. The taste is not surprisingly sour and tart, but it also has a candy sweet-tart like flavor to it. It has a acidic bite to it as soon as it hits your tongue, and then mellows out a bit to show some of the complex flavors. The cherries come through very nicely in the finish. Awesome flavors and complexity, probably the best tasting of the style I have had.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's very delicious which helps the drinkability out a lot. It's sour, tart and acidic for sure but it's so good and complex drinking it really is a pleasure. Plus I really love anything with cherries involved in it. The acidity is the only thing that would probably get to me if I were to drink too much of this. 1,173 charactersbillab914, Feb 14, 2010

Aroma is sour, acetic, sweet with a mild note of dark fruit. Tastes nicely sour, of cherry skin, pediococcus, and well rounded. Body is moderate in heft with a smooth plentiful carbonation. Tart and sweet and quite easy to quaff, well deserving of its prestige. 368 charactersvacax, Feb 14, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -10%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a murky amber red/brown with a hint of gold when held in the light. A 1.5" head recedes within a few minutes, leaving a sticky lacing.
Acidic cherry at the front and brown sugary sweetness in the back.
Sweetart-like sourness on the tip and sides of the tongue. Tart cherry again taking the lead here.
Mouthfeel is like a sour cherry candy... a rush of tart up front washes away cleanly, then finally a quick rush of tartness comes back up front.
The mouthfeel makes me want to keep sipping, it is addictive in its uniqueness. Would be great with thanksgiving dinner. 576 charactersgthornton, Feb 14, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 04x3. Poured from a caged and corked 375mL bottle into my White Birch tulip. A satisfying "pop" issues forth when I carefully removed the cork. 
A slow decanting builds four fingers of champagne foam resting atop a clear, dark, mercurial body of shifting colors: rust, rufous, burnt orange, tenné, and mahogany. The head recedes to a shuddering weakly whipped half finger. Lacing is like a mirror filled atlas with glimmering tears. 
Very mild bacteria build the foundation of tartness that seamlessly leads into the cherry aromatics which begin lightly acidic then turn sweet, oaky, and faintly vinuous. Delightful. 
Acidity is more bracing on the palate, but quickly balanced by a light fruity sweetness. Mid-palate you can detect more of the "barnyard" influence of Brett. which adds an excellent complexity to the flavor. Fresh cherry pits, and faint pinot noir grapes are suggested adding further diversity to the range of tartness. Very light bitterness and light wine barrel notes rounds out the finish.
Medium-light bodied, smooth, effervescent, and with the perfect amount of astringency. Hard to imagine this getting any better.
For some time I saw American Wild Ales as a sort of lesser cousin of traditional lambics. While Supplication lacks the intensity of aromatics or flavors (at least at this young stage) compared to its Belgian predecessors, it more than makes up for that in balance and supreme drinkability. 
All in all, a very impressive, superior crafted, creative success. 1,509 charactersaugustgarage, Feb 13, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I feel so lucky to live in a place where I can get this brew. Poured into my RR "TION" glass.
Appearance is beautifull. A light red color with some amber hues. I'm assuming most of the red is from the cherries. Nice thick head with beautiful lacing.
Smells amazing. Tons of Bret funk and sourness going on with a good tart cherry aroma.
Taste is great. This is what a wild ale should taste like. Lots of funk mixed with a great tartness that is on the higher side of the spectrum but not the most tart beer I have had. The cherries are there and taste great. I wish there was a little more but I'm sure that's impossible with this beer. Nice dry finish.
Mouthfeel is good. Great carb and the bottle made a nice loud pop when I opened the bottle.
Overall I would drink this as much as I could because I don't see it often. But I am lucky to see it here and there. 867 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Feb 13, 2010
4.26/5  rDev -5.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a deep copper/cherry color with a finger of head that camps out forever. Smell is cherries up front with surprisingly little tartness or funk. Granted, there is definitely some cobweb and band aid present, it's just not an assault on the senses. Some dry oakiness is also present. Overall just a fine wild ale aroma.
The taste is superb. Tartness is relatively light for the style, inducing only the slightest of puckers. The funk is a bit more prominent on the tongue than it was in the smell, and it carries along with it a rich cherry fruit flavor that adds depth and complexity . I also sense notes of other dark fruits such as raisins, but they are extremely subtle. White grapes, oak, band aid, and yeast round out the flavor profile.
The body is medium and the carbonation levels are very high, but fairly standard for the style. Drinkability is solid thanks to the funk and sourness being kept in check. Overall this is a fantastic beer, and definitely one of the best sours available. 1,001 charactersalcstradamus, Feb 13, 2010

m- champagne-like carbonation, The dryness really leaves you wanting more.

The sourness is considerably amped up. It almost drowned out the malt complexity for me. Those sour cherries are very punchy. It gets almost difficult to drink by the end, but it's a delicious torture. Wonderful beer and I would be very interested to see further changes over time. 396 characterspopery, Feb 10, 2010

Brown/amber/mahogany semi opaque beer. Two and a half finger cream head. Very impressive head retention, and awesome lacing.
Smells of sourness, bready yeast, oak, and a faint bit of vanilla.
Oaky tannins, sourness, brett, cherries, champagne, vague dark fruits (raisins/plumb), and vanilla.

4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Orangish copper with a white 1/2 inch head. Amazing lace all over my tulip glass.
Smell - Phenomenal - Some boozy barrel-aged stuff happening (like Allagash Curieux). Sour cherries and other berry smells also. Appetizing funky yeast aroma.
Taste - Like a punch in the face. Brace yourself for the tartness, but then the lovely backbone of kriek-like cherry flavor. Oud Bruin to the max, with a little saison thrown in, and kriek lambic to finish off. As this warms, more malt character is prevalent, and this is when this can truly be savored. Intensity is present throughout. Long, winey/vinegary finish leaves you smiling. 
Mouthfeel - Very acidic, gets the glands working for sure. Stings the lips a bit, to be honest. After it warms up, thought, more of the wood flavors pop out and the finish is buttery. MMM....
Drinkability - Can't get enough. 867 charactersraoulduke37, Feb 10, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Pours into my Russian River tulip with a hazy tangerine/brown color. If you hold it up to the light you can see bits of the yeast sediment not so much floating in the glass as they are locked in place. About a half finger of head that quickly dissipates and leaves minor lacing.
Smell - That smell! Brett, wine, tart/sour Michigan cherries. Once this strong forefront smell wanes, the slight barnyard funk begins to emerge though not as heavily as I would have thought. Slight wet hay/dust is really the main funk I am getting.
Taste - There were three definte phases to this beer which were amazing for the fact they were so distinct it felt like three different beers at once. First, the sour punch at the outset where you can taste those amazing tart cherries which gives a wave of slight sweetness. The beer then changes gears and decides to get it's "funk on" allowing you to taste some of the earthy barnyard flavors previously mentioned under the smell. Now the end is where it really got me. I haven't seen this in other reviews but I got a slight red wine undertone but this gave way to a relatively strong black licorice flavor that actually stays after the sip. Very interesting and incredibly tasty. 
Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel, great carbonation that prickles the tongue, and finishes a tad dry.
Drinkability - For as sour as it is, I am rather enjoying this 375ml bottle. I really wish I could do a comparison between Temptation, Consecration, and this beer (the only three sours from RR I've had). I definitely feel this is better than Consecration in my honest opinion, and also edges out Temptation. Still, it would be interesting to see them all together. This one has a massive sour punch and I rather enjoy that. An amazing beer and I'm glad I picked up a couple extra so I can age them. 1,826 charactersSpdKilz, Feb 09, 2010

Opens with a POP. Pours amber orange. Sits in the glass brown/orange and cloudy. Some yeast sediment floating around. Nice coating on the glass. 
Smell is exceptional! Pino noir, corriader, booze, grapes, tomatoes, apple cider vinegar. 
There is a distinctt tone of brettanomyces here, like some lambics
Tastes sour up front. VERY different. Braggs apple cider vinegar, sour wine, and many sweet overly ripe fruits. The 
carbonation makes it seem like it is a very flavorful chamapagne. 
A bit too sour for me. makes the mouthfeel a bit difficult to

4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had this on tap on the release day and out of the bottle the day after. I prefer this on tap than in the bottle. The nose and tastes are stronger out of the keg. 
The appearance is a murky brown color with lots of purple hues. Like most of the Russian River sours the head is very crisp at first, then goes away by the first few sips. A very crisp carbonation is evident, both in the bottle and on tap. 
The smell is of Brett, tart and sour cherries, bits of wooden oak, and just overall funk. These first smells of fresh Supplication are very fruit dominant, reminding me of Consecration. 
The taste is superb, just the right combination of tart cherries with that funky brown ale base. Lots of great funk that is brought on by Brett and Pedio among others. Another sour that just keeps the mouth watering after the beer has left. 
The mouthfeel is tart and funky. Incredibly mouth watering with such an enjoyable mix of sour characteristics, delicious. 
The drinkability is great. Is there any doubt that Russian River makes the best wilds? This is just another testament to a brewer striving for perfection.

4.87/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The best sour I've ever had. Pours a dark orange/light brown that turns golden at the edges in the light. A nice tan head that sticks around for much longer than one would expect, but does eventually disappear. The smell is fantastic... So complex. Sweet sweet dark fruits: lots of cherry and plum along with figs and currants. a great oakiness to compliment the brett smell that is so overwhelmingly awesome. I find it hard to really get a grip on everything that eminates from a glass of supplication. 
The flavor is equally phenomenal. Everything from the aroma is there in a big way. Lots of oak and cherries up front to start off sweet, and then it moves into the more subtle fruit flavors with the plum and figs. Raisins are even perceptible. Some alcohol to go along with the beautiful tartness in the finish and sweet sweet aftertaste that keeps you reaching for so much more. Just a really, super complex, ridiculously well made beer.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and wonderful with, of course, excessive carbonation. The drinkability is as good as any sour out there.
This beer brings tears to my eyes. Highly recommended. 1,133 charactersjdklks, Feb 06, 2010

Clear reddish-amber. Plenty of head upon pouring which dies down to a steady cap of bubbles. Plenty of lacing. Swirling the glass brings back a really nice head again.
The aroma is bright and tart. The tartness is acetic, and smells slightly oaky as well.
Taste starts bracingly sour (duh). More vinager-y tartness. Cherries are evident in the middle, and then finishes with a tannic dryness. Sour, yet very drinkable and refreshing! 466 charactersk3n, Feb 06, 2010

4.43/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a 7 oz champagne flute and allowed this to warm to about 50 degrees before digging into it.
A: Pours a darkish peach, almost has some brownish color to it. There is a ring of head around the edges of the glass, but as with most wilds that I have tried, the carbonation does not manifest itself in any form of visible head. Additionally, the carbonation seems to be better masked than I have seen in bottled wilds. There are no coarse bubbles on the sides of the glass submerged in the beer (as you would see in soda). This is in stark contrast to the Yellow Bus and Frambozen that I tried at my last tasting of sours.
S: Obviously, one of the dominant aromas is the strong brettanomyces funk, but there is much more to this beer than just sourness. Very evident is a musty and tart cherry character, undoubtedly from the cherries used in the creation of this beer. However, there is also a sweet aspect to this that I did not expect. It doesn't come from any malt profile, so I suspect that it is again the cherries.
T: The first striking thing about this beer once it is on my palate is that it is much more sour than I had initially expected after the aroma was mild and somewhat sweet. This is definitely a Russian River sour, as their yeast strain comes though very evidently. This sour flavor is complemented nicely by an earthiness that comes from the barrel aging, sweetness from the cherries, and an underlying red wine acidity from the pinot noir aging.
M/D: This beer is very desirable on pretty much every level. Despite looking flat, Supplication on tap surprises with a tingly feeling of carbonation that envelops the palate, working with the yeast to give a mouth-puckering feeling. As this was the latest batch of Supplication, I imagine that a couple more months of aging will do this beer a lot of good as the sour notes mature and amplify. However, the flavor and the balance of sweet and sourness in the this beer is impressive, to say the least. 1,981 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Feb 02, 2010

S: The cherries have diminished quite a bit from this one in the going on two years since it's release. In their place, a vinegar aroma has started to set in. The oak and funk are still prominent and help to distract you from the acetic qualities.
T: The cherries seem to be lingering a bit in terms of the flavor. The vinegar is not quite as pronounced as it is in the nose, but still detectable. There is also some lactic sourness and a mild Brett funk and definitely dryness.
M: The body is medium with a a slight slickness on the tongue. A moderate level of carbonation provides a bit of dryness to the finish.
D: Just as drinkable as the fresh batch that will be released on Friday. That said, I think this one should be consumed fairly soon, unless more vinegar is your thing in sours. 966 characterswomencantsail, Feb 01, 2010
4.71/5  rDev +4.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Source/Serving: Draft
Smell: Molasses, exceedingly ripe plum, some sour, a little brett/horsey notes, and tart citrus hops. Awesome.
Taste: Wow. Quite tart but the fruit flavor is overwhelming. Its like tart cherry candy in the best way possible. Sweet ripe plums and cherries collide with honey and refreshing yeast and spicy notes to just make everything delightful. Wood notes lay low but add character. Toasted caramel emerges as the temperature increases a bit.
Finish is quick, citrusy, sour and crisp - doesn't linger at all.
Notes: Amazing brew. My favorite between RR temptation, consecration, and this...though it is a close one. 643 characters4000qtrap, Jan 31, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this on tap at the Blind Lady Ale House. Pours out with a nice copper color, which I'm guessing comes from the cherries, decent amount of head in the glass. Smell and taste were almost identical for me... tart cherries, with just a hint of sweetness. I felt this beer was perfectly carbonated, dry like a champagne and incredibly easy to drink. The bar listed it at 9% abv, though it's listed differently here, either way, it was a beer where the alcohol creeps up on you so beware! I had read that the beer is barrel aged, but I didn't really get "barrel" flavors as you might with some other B.A. beers. Another home run from Russian River. 646 charactersthedindaniel, Jan 31, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the brewpub today in an unbranded version of their -tion glass. Served too cold for my tastes so I had several glasses of water while it warmed.
Pale, slightly hazy, almost rust colored beer. Head is off white and quickly recedes to an a small ring but to be fair this is a Wild Ale on draft so in my experience a large persistent head is not to be expected. 
Both sour and sweet cherries are quite clear on the aroma, more so than I remember from my previous few experiences with this beer. Other notes include yeast and fresh bread. Not as sour/acidic as I remember but this is likely much fresher than the last time I tried it.
The acidity I was missing on the aroma is there on the flavor, especially on the entry and mid sip but still finishes somewhat fruity. Has a delayed aftertaste which is sour without being obviously "buggy". There's a slight red wine vinegar accent but nowhere near as intense as that characteristic can be in some AWA's and lambics. The more I drink the more the different flavors amalgamate and the more I seem to enjoy it.
Carbonation is probably on the high side as has been my experience with most of Vinnie's wilds. The balance of the various flavors keeps drinkability very high. I'm actually enjoying this much more than I expected. Too bad I couldn't convince them to sell me a growler. Can't wait for the bottles to come out next month. 1,390 charactersberkey, Jan 17, 2010
4.43/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4375ml bottle. Batch 003. Poured into a tulip glass. Purchased at the brewery when it was first released and kept at cellar temperature. Poured into a tulip glass. Comes in at 7.00%.
A-Pours a golden orange amber color. It has a two finger almost tan colored head that has incredible retention and rests at about half of its original size. The head results in great streaks of lace after every sip. Large amounts of bubbles can be seen continuously breaking from the bottom of the glass.
S-As this bottle is now almost two years old, the pinot noir character has reduced along with the aroma of fresh cherries. It now is a lot more acidic/vinegar-like. The sour/tart cherries can be detected along with some musty oak barrel aroma. There is also definite funk lingering in the nose. The funk and sour elements are quite balanced.
T-It starts with sour/tart cherries. It is not overwhelmingly tart/sour at the start. Mid-sip it has some sweetness from the brown ale base beer and some vanilla from the pak barrels. As it goes down is when its enhanced acidic/vinegar character is a lot more noticeable. It is a lot stronger than when it was fresh. A touch below Beatification's sour level, but definitely stronger than Temptation.
M-Medium bodied, dry, a little oily, and a comfortable carbonation level.
D-After almost two years it is interesting to see how much more tart/sour this beer has become. It is a lot more accessible when fresh. I liked it with age, but miss some of the pinot noir character of a fresh bottle.
I am curious to see how my remaining bottles will continue to age. This beer can be aged for up to four years. I can only imagine it will be quite sour in another year or two. 1,702 charactersmjl21, Jan 14, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Sampled on draft at the brewpub in Santa Rosa.
Pours a deep dark cherry red mahogany color which is pretty cloudy and completely opaque. Frothy 1.5 finger off white head with pretty good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting ring that leaves streaks of soapy lacing behind.
I could smell this beer coming my way from across the room. Lots of eRthy brettu funk with a pro
inent barnyard horseblanlet character in the nose. Very vinous with lots of dark fruit balancing out the brett, especially sour dark cherry, grape, plum and raisin. 
Funky tart Pickering mouthfeel that isn't acidic in the least bit. Perfect balance of brettu funky sourness, slight malt and sweet dark fruit notes. Lots of spur dark cherrry, vinous grape, raisin and plum. The tart curries really come through and make this beer amazing well balanced and quaffable. The ABV is nearly undetectable and there is a slightly vinegary Pickering aftertaste that leaves me salivating for another gulp. I love this damn beer and am so excited to try it on tap. This further cents my opinion that Russian River is the best brewery on the planet. Sek tuis beer out at any cost, especially on draft. 1,169 characterscorby112, Jan 09, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The fiery glow casts a shadow against the darkness, sparks and flame, the cloudy red-orange of a cold night with heat emanating from the flames... True lambic appearance, as the fluff forms just a bit of soap-bubble but then goes on its' way, leaving but a few spots.
"We'll have to make a run for it, the earth caving..."
"We can't hold out much longer!"
"Then GO ON!"
Like so many huskies with a "MUSH!" and a whip, we force ourselves towards the unbearable heat. The wind whipping our backs and the flames licking our faces, and the aromas come.
Huge funk, predominantly brettanomyces and pediococcus, and as we look to our left and groan under the weight, the cherry comes out a bit as well... Old, mouldy, sour cherries that have sat stagnant for so long, as a depth of sweetness behind the wall of sour leaves a massive complexity and we leap through the flames as if our lives depend on it... perhaps they do... close your eyes and embrace the heat, pretend it is but a warmth, keep leaping, don't open your eyes, we must make it...
Now we can breathe again. We pass the flagon around with the flames at our heels, shrieking and mocking us like a cabbage beset with worms, all writhing and stretching, first this way, then that. So then, here they are, the characteristics, this is what we taste. 
Puckering and lightly metallic, with the cherry and oakiness a dominating monstrosity in the middle. The back of the tongue is more lactic and brett sour, with some lemon notes joining the foray simply for good measure. The lingering finish shows itself to be exceedingly dry, but still retains a hint of cherry-like sweetness beyond the immense sour.
The feelings in the mouth are not as substantial... The carbonation is very light, leading into a very dry and puckering finish. It coats our mouths with a mega-warheads like sour, the immense sourness that I can only recall, as it has been so long...
A grin and a glance at our comrades, we've run through it yet again, we're warm and cheery now... may it ever be thus. 2,028 characterskhiasmus, Jan 08, 2010
4/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle batch 002. A bit of a gusher. Pours reddish brown with a thick foamy off-white head. Smells of damp oak, tart cherries, grassy brett funk, some candi sugar and a bit of port. Flavor is strong sour cherry with a delicate creamy sweetness balancing it. There is a strong oak note and grassy funk from the brett, a bit vinous too. Medium body with a very lively carbonation. 378 characterspunkrkr27, Jan 07, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Largadeer earned himself a spot in the Book of Heroic Successes by procuring a growler of this batch of Supplication (which I gather is different from batch 004 that will be released in February). Thank you, Chris.
The growler doesn't really pop (it's over 2 weeks old at this point), but the pour is quite gorgeous. Mildly hazy reddish brown with a dense, beige head with excellent retention and some lacing, this beer also has a gentle but steady stream of carbonation. The head lasts until I drink my entire -TION tulips worth
The nose makes my toes curl. An absolutely fantastic aroma that's a blend of funk, acids, fruits and wine, the balance is quite breathtaking. Opening with a blend of fruity cherries, a little acetic character and a little lactic sourness, the red wine (pinot noir, but I doubt I could nail it at that) character is excellent too. In addition to the cherries, I also get a little raspberry-like character, a little leather, a little brown sugar-like sweetness. The funk is a blend of barnyard, lemon and earthy hay. Mildly oaky with a little vanilla too. Fabulous.
The palate opens with a sharp sourness, a blend of vinegar-like acidity, cherry sourness followed quickly by a rather big vinous character, more than I remember in the previous batches. The leathery, berry-like, mild cocoa notes of the wine pair beautifully with sourness that opens the palate. Funk character is moderate, dominated just a little bit by the sourness and fruit character. Mildly lactic on the finish, the clean sourness enhances the vinous character. Tannic character is moderate, appearing on the finish that's mildly drying. Medium-light in body with a moderate level of carbonation, this beer is quite stunning.
A growlerful? Well, I can't remember the last one I did that with, but the only one I came close to was with Younger. This beer just goes to show Vinnie's genius, I am looking forward to the next 3 hours with this beer.
Fresh, this batch is a bit more vinous than I remember previous batches being. Fantastic stuff
*Edit*
I'm currently on my 5th glass, and have to admit that I am completely loving the big, fruity, sour and vinous character of this beer.
**Edit 07 Oct 2013**
Bottle, batch 003. Over 5 years old at this point. The last time I had this particular batch was in the company of friends in DC right before we moved out west, and today's a mighty special day as well.
The nose is still pretty excellent. Sharp sourness, growing increasingly Flemish with a moderate vinous note. Clean lactic and pedio sourness with a moderate funk (earth, lemon, a touch of mushroom), remarkably bright with a lovely cherry character. The palate is excellent. Bright, sharp, clean, sour and very well balanced, none the poorer for its age with the classic blend of soft vinous notes, bright acidity, modest funk and a little earth. Excellent. 4.5/4.5/4.5
**Edit 01 Feb 2014**
 Batch 4. My last bottle from a case I split with Scott Holland back in the day. 
The sourness has faded some, allowing funk, earth and lemon to dominate along with a blend of loam and petrichor. Beautiful stuff. Bright, cherry sharpness. Quaffable. Funky cherry sourness. 
**Edit 08 Feb 2015**
My last bottle of batch 3. 
Growing vinous with age, the pinot character is really dining along with a soft mushroom like funk. The Chris have faded but the vinous notes keep the memory alive. Kinda like a Bon Chien but lighter. Awesome. 3,440 charactersDefenCorps, Jan 07, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Russian River, I salute you. Poured from the bottle into my Bruery tulip.
Clear, beautiful ruddy brown with golden highlights. A thin cap forms, but only a collar remains after a couple of minutes. The color reminds me of what a deep sunset on the beach looks like. 
Smell: Yep, there's the Russian River signature. Unmistakable sourness awaits me. Tart cherries, wood, musty old attic, and a faint pungent smell of putrefaction. I know that last item probably sounds bad, but I think it's goddamn great. 
Taste is exquisite. This bottle is not particularly fresh, but it was stored in cold conditions for a long time. I think this is probably why the cherries are still somewhat prominent here. Cherry, oak, red wine, all taking turns dancing with the buggy acidity. Quick finish.
Mouthfeel is very good. Very dry, crisp finish, with lively carbonation. The carbonation is, at first, a tiny bit harsh... a few minutes into the glass it has smoothed out considerably.
Drinkability: I might drink gallons of this when bottles are released later this year. Fantastically drinkable.
This and Consecration (Batch 1) are my two favorite Russian River sours to date. This is great stuff. I am looking forward to trying it fresh. 1,228 charactersdavod23, Jan 07, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Although I went to RR to try the oh-so-raved-about-Plinys (with reason), the beer that absolutely floored me was Supplication. This ranks in the top 10 beers I've ever had (which is determined by a complex algorithm involving the beer, where I had it, and the overall experience of drinking said beer). 
Color is bronze to orange - darker with hints of evil lurking. 
Wonderful sour cherries and wood in the nose. Earthy, musky, clean forest decay. Just what you want from a wild. 
Cherry tartness up front as you'd expect, but eased out and rounded by sweet ripe fruit and then the dryness of the oak lingers. The acitic tannins sit on the back center of your tongue forever, just tempting you to mellow them out again with another sip. 
Despite the complex flavors and darker character, I found this beer to have a lighter mouthfeel due to its tartness and dryness.
Drank a ton. Too much, actually. Paid for it the next day in the Muir Woods bathroom (or was it the oysters?).
Was worth the payment, regardless. 1,019 charactersFirstMan, Dec 28, 2009
4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5One of a number of very special things I had at Russian River recently, and my overall favourite.
Sort-of-murky reddish brown with no head to speak of. Looks like some kind of wood varnish, and smells a little like it too - woody and acidic, with sour cherries, oxidised red wine, apple cider vinegar and band-aids. 
The taste is similar to the above description, in the best possible way. Big dark cherries and grapes to the fore, with all the other stuff in the mix. Earthy, drying tannins and a tantalizingly ephemeral hint of sweetness. Complex as hell, and utterly refreshing and invigorating. 
Light in feel and briskly carbonated, perfectly balanced and ridiculously complex without ever being a "challenge". I had another few things I desperately wanted to try, not knowing when and if I'll ever be back in Santa Rosa, but I could have had a few more of these, easy. Just dreamy. 890 charactersParrotshake, Dec 20, 2009
4.08/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I drank this batch 003 from a 375ml bottle into a Rochefort glass.
The beer pours a brownish ornange more of an orange tinge with a about 2 fingers of head that has a dark orange tint to it. The retention is great, the head lasts about 5 minuts but even after that is a heavy head that lasts forever. The lacing is great as well. 
The aroma is slightly disappointing because its relatively light and not overtly complex. Mostly you just get some tartness overall with a little oak at the. 
The taste is good not great. Just like the aroma its not complex just a very nice sour note from start to finish. I love sour but I want to be rewarded as well. At the end I get a little wood.
The feel is nice and coats well, drinkability is down a tad.
Overall, this is a pretty good wild ale but nothing spectactular. I prefer the RR Temptation. 842 charactersjrallen34, Dec 17, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Edited to reflect newer batches (at the time of this writing, batch 006). There's always a minor rearrangement every time Russian River releases a new batch of sours. As of 10/26/2011, the latest Temptation is winning, with Consecration next, and Supplication last. 
~~~
All right, I should probably review this since I've had in on tap multiple times now. Batch 004 at the Bistro -bal Fest and again on tap at the Rose & Crown in Palo Alto. 
A: Pours a murky amber with glowing orange highlights when held to the light. It has a finger of cream-colored head that retains pretty well; it eventually retreats into a clump of bubbles on the brew and a very thin collar, with no lacing. 
S: What a fantastic aroma. It has the right balance of tart, sour cherries, acetic acid, and lactic sourness. Tannins come through quite strongly, along with grapes (I didn't pick up on this until largadeer pointed it out, but afterward, it was obvious). Just the slightest hint of brett, with a musty leather undercurrent. 
T: Sour cherries and more than a hint of dark red grapes, giving it a vinous quality right from the start. It's lactic up front, with the mid-taste seeing an evolution of tannins and light leather. The finish is acetic and dry, but not so overwhelming that it burns the throat. There is a little lingering sourness in the aftertaste. 
M: I was very pleased with the balance of characteristics here. I don't enjoy super-dry or super-acetic beers; Supplication delivers both qualities in moderation, producing a sublime drinking experience. It's light-bodied with moderate carbonation that cleanses the palate very well. 
D: I had two 10oz pours of this and strongly considered a third. In fact, as I'm typing this up, I'm tempted to go back and get said third. Probably my favorite Russian River wild ale now that Consecration's recipe has changed. 1,864 charactersArbitrator, Dec 05, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had on tap at the brewpub in the newer style Russian River glass as opposed to the old tulip style.
This beer came out with next to no head. There was a thin veil of bubbles across the top of the beer but as I drank it down none stuck to the sides of the glass. The color was decided caramel with the translucent liquid having a honey color when held up to a light source.
Boom, this beer smells like Russian River. That Brett funk is here with each waft smelling more and more like the cork of a freshly popped bottle of red wine. with a deeper inhale I get some oak chords along with that indescribable wet barnyard stench.
This is a chewable beer. There is very little carb bite to it and though the beer itself might not be thick, my tongue thinks it is due to its mellow, nearly fizz free texture.
This beer is TART. Like taking a hit of apple cider vinegar tart. It reminds me of that sour feeling you get when you eat dried apricots, minus the apricot flavor of course, a natural sour vibe abounds. There is a bit of tart cherry flavor to this guy and the barrel aging is certainly noticeable with the hint of oak. Truly a sour head's delight.
Not too high drinkability as I find this RR sour in particular to have a cumulative puckering affect. Really only one glass is suitable, but that one glass is really a good one. 1,333 characterscptierney, Dec 01, 2009

Mouth- dry, warming acids. not bone dry, but well balanced. fine carb.

Waited forever for this beer since I didn't want to ever pay $20 for a 375ml bottle at City Beer. Now that I've had it, well, I should have been willing to pay that and then some. I had this on tap at the Bistro Barrel Aged Fest in Hayward.
Pours a brilliant reddish amber with slight haze and a half-inch of creamy off-white foam.
Aroma is amazing with sour cherry, bretty and lactic notes, leather, oak, and some sweet malt.
Flavor is tart, with brett, lacto, pedio, funk, and some sweet caramel malt, sour cherries, oak, and spice. Complex and just amazingly good flavor. Sour but not overly so like Beatification can be. Just absolutely heavenly. Best sour from Russian River BY FAR in my opinion, and that's saying something.
Medium body with a sharp, acidic palate and a long finish.
Drinkability is very high and the ABV is very well-hidden. Went back for this two more times despite all the other great barrel aged beers there. Great beer, Vinnie! Worth the long wait. 1,065 charactersnickd717, Nov 17, 2009

Batch 3
Poured into tulip glass.
Opens with a nice big pop very easily. I should have been a little more careful opening this guy. I took one small wif from the bottle and my mouth is already watering.
Poured slowly but a nice big near 2 finger head that is colored very slight tan. Decent retention leaving some nice lace walls down the glass. Aroma is a clear peach hued copper.
Aroma: Vinegar/acidic aromas, tart cherries, oak/wood, tons of wild notes. Mmmm it is delicious. 
Taste: These sour beers are quite awesome. Not as much vinegar/acidic flavors here as I was expecting from the aroma (not that it's a bad thing). Cherries are tart, but not overly tart. The oak is a lot more dominate here and takes over the cherry flavor a bit. The wild yeasts obviously make this one tart. The taste is very dry. 
Mouthfeel: Very sour and tart, but not as tart as others I have had. Still makes the mouth pucker. Medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Ends with a very clean sour cherry flavored aftertaste. 
Overall, one of the best sours out there imo. Very drinkable and I wish I had more of this. I will probably have to get some of the next batch when it comes out. All around a good beer. I really enjoyed that it wasn't overly dominated by vinegar and acidic tastes. 1,344 charactersmothman, Oct 18, 2009

Amber in color with a light red cherry tint. Small, bright white head that leaves minimal lacing. Slow/steady stream of carbonation from nucleation site.
Acetic acid/vinegar aromas are primary. Some oaky/vanilla impressions with tart cherries coming out of the glass secondarily. I could already tell from the smell that the cherries were fading into the background.
This is a changed beer (not a bad thing). When fresh I think of these as very Kriek like. With some age, the taste is dominated more by the acetic acid and wood tannins with sour cherry being more of a background flavor. Lacks the juiciness of the fresh bottle. Still packs great sour flavor.
Mouthfeel is prickly with sour/tartness. Seems to be medium/high carbonation for the style which keeps the beer lively and bright.
High level of drinkability with the light cherry flavors and carbonation balancing the sourness.
I may like this beer better fresh, but this was still great. 1,017 charactersJRhode, Oct 04, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was lucky enough to try this on tap.
Rusty amber color without much head.
Floral and bretty notes with wonderful cherry notes.
Taste is sour cherries, subtle vanilla, and pinot noir.
Mouthfeel is where it really blows up. It's a medium mouthfeel that finishes acidic with superb dry, red wine tannins.
Probably not really drinkable for a lot of people considering how sour and dry it is. For me, bring it by the pitcher. 427 charactersbrownbeer, Sep 30, 2009

A-Slightly hazed copper with a thin white head that left spotty lace.
S-Dry oak and sour cherry. Not intensely sour, more tart, Lightly aromatic but quite pleasant.
T-Cherry flavour up front and very prevalent. Comes through as a super tart cherry. Oak notes meld throughout adding a nice amount of depth and dryness.
M-Light bodied, crisp and tart, Drying finish with long lasting sourness.

4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 3
A - A cloudy burnt brownish color that sits squarely between a belgian pale and belgian dark. A moderate brownish white head builds and recedes quickly, with a little that retains and remains. Unique.
S - Certainly a tart aroma from the cherries and smorgasbord of other fruit underscored by biscuity spice and some wet leather brett aroma. Sweet, earthy, funky and spicy, with each facet taking its proper place. 
T - Having had Temptation recently, I was anxious to see if Supplication was both as distinct and excellent as her blonde sister. Amazingly the answer is yes. Up front is some intense sour and tartness. It takes a few sips to get past the sourness and get the heart of this brew. The sourness gives way to some caramel malt bread taste. Some mild funk sticks its head in to say hello somewhere in the middle, but the Brett makes a quick visit, and goes as fast as he came. In the end is a nice rise of pure sweetness from cherries, grapes, melons oh my which goes against some yeast spice. Some oakiness lives in the breath.
M & D - Light/medium bodied with just the right balance of carbonation and smoothness to enhance the flavors. The sourness dries the tongue right out, and the flavors make you yearn for the next sip. A winning combination, but I'm not looking the empty glass that my future soon holds. 1,337 charactersschinebd, Sep 24, 2009

4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to JDV for this bottle, batch 003. Poured into a dogfish head signature glass.
The beer pours a muddy/ruby red with a one finger off-white head. The beer is very carbonated and looks very appealing.
The smell is all tart/sour cherries with a little malt in the background. There is definitely some funk in the background, nothing extreme, but a nice earthy funk that blends with the slight oak barrel scent under all that tart cherry.
The smell is sour cherry followed by some more sour cherry!! What an awesome wave of sour, bordering on bitter, flavors. The sweetness from the brown ale along with the slight oakiness come through to balance the tart cherry at the end, but that is very minimal.
The mouthfeel of the beer is perfect for the style, it is well carbonated, dry and crisp. This is a beer that I wish I had multiple bottles of, and something I would like to drink all the time for sure. 911 charactersrpstevens, Aug 30, 2009

Pours a reddsih brown with no head which isn't surprising. I don't think I've ever had anything with a wild yeast that has had a head. It's a bit murky too. Definitely true to the style, a good looking beer.
Smells acidic with some barnyard funk. The cherries come through a bit with the funk. 
Tastes acidic but not overly so. This is a perfect amount of tartness and sourness. The cherries come through as well but not too much. If you didn't tell me to look for them I may have not tasted them.
Mouthfeel is great. Almost the perfect body for this kind of beer. It isn't thin and it isn't thick. Probably because the base beer for this was a brown ale.
Drinkability is high, I want more of this but I couldn't see myself craving this all night. 850 charactersauroracrisis, Aug 25, 2009

Taste is very complex and has many flavors including: oak, sour, fruit, tartness, pepper spice, and some acidic spiciness. Overall this is not a punch you in the mouth sour like some of the other sours out there. Its more subtle. Its more drinkable. My drinking buddy commented its like eating a piece and candy and wanting more. That's what its like between sips. Overall a great brew. 508 charactersfiver29, Aug 21, 2009

A. Light copper color with a thin ring of foam covering the top. 
S. Cherries, lemons, funk-tastic-ness (Brett, Lacto, etc etc). Sherry like oxidative notes with some woodsy aromas thrown in. This beer is uber complex. 
T. Orange and lemon tartness with some barnyard funk. Lime peel, sherry, slight bubblegum and a touch of caramel sweetness is about all I can pick out. This beer is crazy, over the top complex. 
M. Thin to medium in the mouth--quite zingy in terms of carbonation. Somewhat puckering but that's what I wanted with this beer. 
D. On this hot, summer brew-day, this beer really does myself and mrandypandy well. So complex and lively. This beer has like 2000 different tastes going on. It feels like a sour pogo-stick jumping around on my tongue. Nice job, guys! 806 charactersMMAJYK, Aug 11, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I poured this one from a 12.9oz brown bottle into a tulip pint glass. This was batch number 003.
A= This sour ale poured a very hazy orange/amber color with a now-you-see-it-now-you-don't 3/4" off white head that appeared and disappeared completely in a heartbeat. No lacing to speak of. 
S= This one gave a general aroma of sourness and tartness for sure, but I also found grapes, wine, and some background sweetness. The sour character of this beer lent a certain baryard funk to the initial smell that was pretty complex. The barrel lent just a hing of wood smell.
T= Some fairly faint malt shot underneath a big sour tartness. Though throughout there are hints at a myriad of flavors like grapes, cherries, wood, etc I found the sourness and the spicy yeast character to be most prominent. Though I am not well versed in sour ales, this definitely has a great deal of appeal to me in the flavor department. Finished very dry and tart. 
MF= Medium bodied made to feel lighter by a near-magical carbonation level. I say that because after 10 minutes in the glass, there is not a bubble or sign of cabonation to be seen yet this ale felt dry and very crisp on my tongue.
D= This was easily the best sour I have had to date...world class for sure. I really appreciated the flavors without being overwhelmed by them. Despite the challenging nature of this sour, I believe it would be easy to have a couple in one sitting. 1,425 charactersspointon, Jul 24, 2009

Small corked bottle, opens with a very loud pop, poured into a tulip.

Medium bodied yet refreshing; tart and acidic notes dominate the flavor. Fruitiness, some spiciness, with faint vanilla and oak.

Poured from 375ml bottle into Duvel tulip.
A nice "pop" once the cork came off...a nice sound. ;-)
A - Pours a burnt orange with a white fizzy head. Bubbles linger on top and around the edge of the glass. Carbonation continues to rise up from the bottle of the glass to the top. Some lacing, but the head isn't all that sticky, which doesn't bother me at all.
S - A wonderful fruity tart smell immediately hits the nose. Lots of oranges, apples, mangos, pineapple mixed with some wonderful sour cherries, lemons, and limes. A fruit explosion, you could say. There isn't an overpowering of either, a perfect match, which is something I look for in an American Wild Ale. Too much of one or the other takes away from the beer - this is a perfect balance.
T - Nice and tart/sour right off the bat but not much sweetness at all, which is surprising because of the nose. I also get some oak/wood flavors. A dry finish, much like champagne. The aftertaste is where I get some fruity sweetness - very nice. Really enjoyable, just what I was looking for when I opened this bottle.
M - Very nice and rich, although light in body. Nice fizzy carbonation which matches perfectly with the style. I'm enjoying this one much like a glass of fine champagne, probably even more.
D - A really enjoyable AWA that I'm going to look for again. I know it's getting hard to find, but hopefully I'll be able to trade for another down the road. RR does it yet again! 1,456 charactersSean9689, Jun 05, 2009

Review #425
The beer poured a hazy, orangey-amber color with a bubbly, light tan, one-finger head that quickly faded to a frothy mass. As the beer warmed, the chill hazed disappeared and the beer turned a brilliant copper-amber color. Odd shaped blocks of lacing cascaded down the glass.
The aroma was amazingly interesting and complex. Funky and sour with obvious brett characteristics. Semi-sweet, sour cherry and lemon peel notes came through as well. Crisp and musty with a barnyardy twang.
The taste was even more impressive than the aroma. Lots of brett and funk right from the start. Maltier and richer however than your average sour ale. As in the aroma, sour cherry notes were apparent. The fruity, sweet/tart cherry flavor really helped to balance out the beer. Hints of vinegar appeared in the lingering, dry, oaky and tannic finish. White wine-like characteristics (pinot noir?) were also noticeable. Overall, an incredibly complex brew.
The mouthfeel was creamy, frothy and silky smooth with a fine yet lively effervescence. This sour definitely had a bit more heft than I am used to for the style.
Drinkability was outstanding. The beer was funky and tart but well balanced by the rich malts and sweet/tart fruity notes. Furthermore, the 7% ABV was barely detectable. I wish I could have sipped this one all night long.
This was definitely the best Russian River sour I have had to date and possibly the best sour overall. Not only did this beer contain an amazing amount of intensity and complexity but it displayed a level of balance demonstrated by few others. This brew is destined to be a classic. 1,731 charactersDamian, May 12, 2009
4.54/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Graduation Tasting: This was the first beer brought out, courtesy of Dyan. Caged and corked 375ml, and poured into a high stemmed tulip.
This pours a body that is a very shiny and slightly hazy orange-copper body. Slight white creamy head that laces well.
The smell is very floral, with an incredibly nice oak component. Sour tart cherry, pinot noir blend with with primary scents. Brett acts more a background plug-in. Light fruits are prevalent, as well.
Incredibly tart, mouth puckering cherry is matched with incredible oak age and a very well executed Brett/lemon sourness. Sour grapes standout, and add for an impeccable taste. This is such an easy drink with many pinot noir characteristics. 
This served for a great start to the day, thanks again Dyan! 764 charactersCoolJosh, May 11, 2009
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On a day in which I was able to celebrate my birthday, go to Port Brewing's 3rd anniversary party, devour two pints of Angel Share, and go to O'brien's...a good buddy of mine, decided to end our day of triumph by purchasing a bottle of Supplication. Thanks Mauerhan, and to all those that made this birthday remarkable. 
A: As I have come to expect with most American Wild Ale's, this brew boasted a prune juice like hue with cherry highlights to go along with it. Carbonation was visibly abundant as was the thick layer of lacing clinging to the edge of my glass.
S: Unlike other sours I've had, Supplication seems to have a complexity that separates itself from others within the same style. Nice cherry notes throughout the whole whiff which helps mask the strong sour yeast components. The brown ale characteristics are slightly noticeable.
T: The brown ale subtleties in the aroma definitely come through a lot more on the palate, as does the strong and swift tart flavor that puckers and constricts the tongue/lips (Don't give me a hard time on that last line Victor...cause I know what you're thinking). The cherries on the other hand, back off and let the other qualities of the beer take over. Alcohol adds some punch and kick to the flavor profile also.
M: More than enough carbonation...which I feel fits and adds a refreshing quality to the "lambic" style ales. I like it a lot!
D: Very impressed! Not necessarily an easy drinker, but full of flavor and refreshes you in a way that is unique to other beers within this same genre. I loved this beer the first time I had it, and I still think it's among some of the best sours I've had. 
Overall: What a way to finish off a wonderful birthday...sorry, had to mention it once more. Anyways, this beer is worth getting your hands on, even if you don't like this style of beer. More flavor than you would expect and a great beer overall. Cheers! 1,909 charactersOlieIPA, May 11, 2009

A: Pours a hazy brown with noticeable crimson and brick colored hues. Yields a nice off white with a nice noticeable spritziness and carbonation.
S: Wow. Tons of lemon soaked red grapes, nice Cabernet or another red wine, lemon and yeast funk. This is a very complex smelling beer.
T: Just an incredible sour. Nice vinous qualities with red wine, red grapes, lemon tartness, dry oakiness and some light grapes as well. One of the most complex sours yet nice and easy to drink.
Overall, this was an incredible beer. Thanks again to Dyan and I can't wait to try this again! 717 characterstreyrab, May 11, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Continuing my tradition of a Russian River sour on my birthday each year. This will finish the day off nicely.
Batch 002
APPEARANCE: Pours into my Hennepin tulip a somewhat murky reddish brown. There's not much of a head on it - instead it forms a thick white collar with a splotchy haze of foam across the surface of the beer.
SMELL: Damn. In stream of conscious form: sour, tart, deep, complex, vinous, dark fruits, chocolate-covered cherries, alcohol. And one more: awesome.
TASTE: Insanely tart right from the get go. As it subsides, a major fruitiness develops then starts going 100 different ways. There's a decent alcoholic heat on the end as well as a mild bitterness that I cannot believe would be from any hops. And then it keeps going. The flavor of chocolate is left in your mouth even after you swallow. And as if that wasn't enough, your mouth then seizes up with an intense tartness leaving you wanting.. no, needing another sip.
MOUTHFEEL: The carbonation is a tad low, perhaps due to the 2+ years of storage I gave this beer. The body is, well, bone dry.
DRINKABILITY: This beer is beyond awesome and I wish I could drink it forever. That is all.
If my calculations were correct, this should be the beer that puts the first drop of beer in my mug. Matching it up with review #300 would have awesome, but that just means I have another excuse to open up something awesome again soon. As it is, I'm still reeling from the fact that this bottle will no longer be in my 'cellar'. My spreadsheet says I bought it on 4-18-07 - over 2 years ago. But a birthday is a great day to reward all that patience. 1,621 charactersjmalex, May 06, 2009

4.2/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4HUGE thanks to Floydster for hooking me up with this great brew. Batch 003. 375 ml poured into my snifter. I am consuming this as I review it.
A- Body is a very hazy IPA-like amber hue. Pours with a nice, bubbly 1-2 finger head that immediately subsides to a thick collar and has great retention from there. Cloudiness is thick and mostly uniform with some dynamic yeast sediment floating around at the bottom.
S-The first thing that comes to the nose is slightly sour with a big accent on vinegar but a slightly acidic sourness as well. Behind this is sweet orange, exotic fruit, and a hint of cherry as well as a hint of vanilla and oak.
T- Slightly salty flavor upfront accompanied by a slight vinegar sourness. Behind this is some oak and a slight presence of exotic fruit but the cherry is a bit hard to detect. More oak and perhaps cherry pits come through for the finish as the initial sourness and saltiness wears off. What lingers is the remnants of oak and cherry flavors as well as a slight acidic bitterness.
M-High tingly carbonation and medium weight body. Body is not crass but does have a slightly acidic tone to it.
D- This is another great sour from RR. Not as good as their other sours that I have tried, IMO...but still a very very good sour. This one has a bit more of a vinegar presence than the others but is still a very good, well done beer. I am looking forward to Consecration and their other beers that I have not tried yet. 1,457 charactersPittBeerGirl, Apr 11, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 003 - sampled April 6, 2009.
Sun blistered cognac that is, quite surprisingly, crystal clear. The complexion is immaculate and its tone radiant. The refermentation in bottle (the same process used in Champagne) was hugely successful at providing carbonation; the capping is firm, thick and thorough. It's said for Champagne that the smaller the bubbles the finer the wine - if these little acrobatic pin pricks are any indication this will be of the usual Vinnie Cilurzo high standard of quality. 
Pouring the bottle at arms length I could pick up on the aromatics of fruit vinegar, musty oak and fruit juices. With my nose buried in the glass the funky trio of Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus wild yeasts raddle the nose hairs. Its volatile, long-chained molecules then stream up the nasal passage, prancing through a pattern of receptors, before finally tickling the olfactory nerve cell at the bulb of the brain. 
It is there, in the brain's olfactory cortex, where higher functions such as memory and emotion are coordinated with the sense of smell. My memory makes the connection to musty, wine soaked oak barrels, butterscotch and cherry juice. The emotion side recaptures the encounters of gueuze in Brussels, it reminisces the Red Ales of Flanders, and remembrance of a tasting in the barrel room in Santa Rosa. 
The taste is, put simply, a sour red wine-like Belgian-style ale with tons of complex funk. More specifically, it's an intense fruitiness that includes plum, ripe raspberry, black cherry and red currant flavors. The taste of musty oak is prevalent and the backdrop is a combination of both metallic and malty notes. There are hints of butterscotch, an abundance of vanilla and spicy phenols in low amounts. 
The mouthfeel is dominated by an acidic, tannic bitterness and a touch of oxidization. The sourness (which is still well shy of being puckering) imparts a noticeably acetic/vinegary character. There's also a touch of sherry-like character which, along with the brown malts, produces a sweet-and-sour profile (the sour outnumbering the sweet by 2:1). It has all the dryness of a white wine but all the complexities of an aged, vintage red. 
I've enjoyed this batch more than the previous (002) but I appreciate the concept of each vintage being unique. Such annual changes burgeon with notions of immortality and evolution; the idea that the beer lives on to provide sustenance even after its grains are spent, the cherries rotted and the yeasts tired. The beautiful tragedy of it is the vintage is consumed and only the memory of it remains; thus conveying the transience of life.
...at least until next year. 2,662 charactersbiegaman, Apr 06, 2009
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5In a tulip:
This brew has some seriously insane lacing over and amber/copper hazy body. From the moment the cork is popped, the room fills with a sour aroma. The nose also has green apple, raisin, and coriander. The taste has pounds of sweet and sour, with a pleasant green apple tartness in the beginning and a sour bitter finish that gives way to a cherry aftertaste. Extremely thick mouthfeel for the style and carbonation that ably delivers flavor. So delicious... I could drink quite a bit of this.
Overall: Supplication was my first sour. Wow, this is incredible. I can't believe what I've been missing. 611 charactersschroederm, Apr 05, 2009

Pours deep, glowing red with a copper tint. Thin, fluffy off-white head that fades into some soapy suds. 
Nose is really complex - red grape skins and a bit of sour cherry, nicely sour with a light barnyard funkiness that has the signature - I don't know, authenticity? Complexity? - of Russian River's bigs. Vinous, very interesting.
Taste starts with a beautiful combination of sour bite and tannic, vinous red grape skins. Sourness isn't too in your face, but it's certainly set off by the clear, vinous red grape character that just shines. Finish is puckering, a bit astringent, faint lingering acidity in the back of the throat after the initial bite.
Mouthfeel is dry, puckeringly sour, light body with crisp carbonation. Beautifully drinkable.
Bottle, batch 3, 07/08. 
Pours a dark orange amber, very hazy, slightly off-white fluffy head. 
Aroma is sour cherry, a bit of citrusy, almost orangey acidity, vinous. 
Taste is sharp tartness up front, bit of vinegar, with a citrusy acidity on the finish - a bit earthy also, woody barnyard. 
Crisp and so light in body. Beautifully done beer. 1,175 charactersJohnQVegas, Apr 05, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4375ml corked and caged brown bottle poured into a tulip.
A: Pours a burning ruby amber with good clarity. A large, fluffy, lightly tinted head forms and holds pretty well. Nice lacing throughout.
S: Nice clean sour and lightly tart aroma. Plenty of the sour cherries coming through along with plenty more of the wine like tannins. A pleasant sweetness plays well with the lightly tart wheat malts. Some woody and earthy notes from the oak.
T/M: Sourness is at a good level and the tartness has definitely been bumped up some since I had this last. More of the sour cherries and tannin qualities as well as a pretty distinctive pear taste. Definitely a bit more funk has formed in the year or so that this has been out lending some musty, dewy flavors as well as some light cheesy flavor(almost nutty and salty like parm-reg). Body is medium to medium light and pretty healthy carbonation. Finishes very dry and a bit puckering and it only gets more puckering as it warms and as I drink more. Not a bad thing :)
D: The 12.7oz. is definitely enough for me but that doesn't mean it becomes too much. Refreshing and drinkable even with the enhancements from the age. 1,166 characterspwoods, Mar 28, 2009

4.32/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Tap @ O'Briens TION night. Poured hazy, bright gold with a frothy white head. Musty, dank yeast funk combined with oaken wine barrel earthiness. Effervescent mouthfeel gives it a light feel. Mouth-puckering tartness right away. Lemony citric bite along with the bretty funk. A vinuous tanginess follows as does the oak and cherry flavors. Definitely a success in terms of aging in that it tones down the sometimes harsh vinegar and cheese flavors. They are present, but in far less degree so the quality of the beer itself comes through. The pricetag on a bottle of this can be prohibitive, which makes having this on tap a rare treat. 635 charactersmagictrokini, Mar 23, 2009
4.54/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I got this one a few months ago from JHenry04 and I've been holding on to it for awhile. I found a good opportunity to share this with a few other BAs and went for it.
A soft hazy body that isn't quite what I would call rust, but it isn't really orange or brown either. A small off-white head that leaves just a bit of spotty lacing on there.
Smell is fantastic. After the first sniff I said "whoa." The sour, tart notes are there, reminding me of both sour apple and sour cherry. Oak is in the background along with some lighter fruits like apricot notes. A little sweetness from brown malts. Big, complex, and very appealing, Supplication seems to be yet another winner from Russian River.
The flavor doesn't disappoint in either complexity or enjoyability. The sour notes come through once again with tart cherry and apple. There are also touches of both vinegar and slightly funky cheese type flavors. There is some good spicy oak characterisitcs that I could swear come with a touch of white wine, but that one could just be my imagination. Some light fruits come out again and the perfect balance of sweet malt is present also.
Mouthfeel is middle of the road in thickness with higher than moderate carbonation. It is pretty highly carbonated actually, but it works here.
This is one hell of a drinkable beer, but you will definitely be sipping Supplication to savor and enjoy it. 1,391 charactersHojaminbag, Mar 23, 2009

Wild yeast is very apparent with a sour, funky smell. 
This beer was sampled with a friend and pointed out that this beer tastes like a warhead hard candy. Some orange is also present in the mix as well as a hint of wood. The cherries are hard to find. 
Good carbonation and a full body hold this beer together. 
A fantastic American Wild Ale. What a great beer, I will have this beer any time it is available. 480 charactersalovesupreme, Mar 23, 2009

Poured from a 12.7 oz bottle into a tulip glass.
A- Pours a radiant amber that leans more to the brown side. Sort of like cider on some steroids, which make it glow. Semi-clear until the yeast went in. Produced a nice three fingers width of white head that lasted quite a while. 
S- Loved it! Had a nice, musty brett smell along with sharp cherry aromas. Comingling amongst these aromas was a tart, vinous scent of oaked grape skins. 
T- Plenty of tartness and citric acidity to go around. Almost mouth puckering at points, just really well done. Plenty of sour cherries and oak flavors to go around. Also liked the unique barrels used as it added a distinct wine-like characteristic to the flavor. 
M- Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Left wonderful sour residue all over the palate.
D- I wish this came in a 750mL bottle. I could definitely put down a few of these in a sitting. If you like sours, this is about as drinkable as they come.
Overall, why do I have to live so far from Russian River? Their sours are amazing and this is no exception. If you can get your hands on it, do it. 1,113 charactersrhinos00, Mar 12, 2009

Me, however, I"m just getting started with this whole Brett thing. Pours a red-tinged amber, a small white head that shrinks to a ring around the collar, not much lacing more than a nugget here or there. Aroma comes mostly in tart cherry, faint oak, and a funky bunch of b-list characters, and for the style, they work nicely.
Taste is all kinds of crazy, to spectacular effect. Tart, sour cherry, oak, funk, must, a dry ending. Quite hard to describe, about as akin to normal beer as American football to 'intl' football. Mouth is mostly dry, medium light bodied, puckering, smooth, rather easy to drink, for its oddity. Its not my first 'brett' beer, but its probably the finest. Much thanks to Tom (MuenchenerKindl) for this one. 945 charactersobjectivemonkey, Mar 12, 2009

a - cidery color, red, clear, lots of head. No gush but tonds of head. Bubbles are like paste on the glass.
s - cherries and sour. Have to forgo some aroma whifs to taste because the head is not moving. The smell really singes my nose hairs a bit. 
t - controlled tartness up front, but asservies and smooth in the middle and slight hint of phenolic (?). Clean finish. Not a long finish. Cherry pits. Phenol taste is slight, but it's something not awesome.
m - very smooth. Not over carbonated, but it should probably be super chilled before opening.
d - super high. I shared this tiny bottle and I want MORE! It's not mouth pucking sour but quality sour that's easy drinking. 691 charactersjojox, Mar 10, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer has really became a legend in just a few years of existence. I have waited to try it for a long time.
Hazy light amber body hosts a solid beige head that stands at an inch and has about three minutes of retention before staying at a skim. Nose is invigoratingly tart with notes of sour cherries, electric funk, and grape skin. With another sniff you get some woodsy alcohol. Immediately attacks the tongue with yeasty barnyard sour funk. The cherries bring about a nice tongue glazing tartness. Yeasty and almost creamy on the back of the tongue. Oak really comes through as you continue to drink. Mouthfeel has back-end thickness, consistent tart funk, and yeast that turns to a veggie like hue. I shared this with my wife and the drinkability makes me wish the bottle was twice as big. 798 charactersSPLITGRIN, Mar 09, 2009

Yee ha. Pours a orange amber colour, with reasonable clarity. Frothy one finger vanilla coloured head with good lacing. Nose- cherry, wood, musty, sour and just damn inviting. Taste- sublime lacto sourness, citric zing, and green apples. Very dry, earthy and woody finish. This brew has dried out quite a bit since the last time I've had one. The cherries are more of a complementary player than in the forefront which is fine by me. Drinkability is superb and the spritzy carbonation dances across the tongue. Very well crafted brew. 652 charactersoakbluff, Mar 08, 2009

A - Nice fluffy white, two-finger head with decent lacing. Reddish orange color with good clarity.
S - Cherry big time. Reminds me of cherry jolly rancher candy. Plenty of oak too and maybe a hint of chocolate.
T - Rhubarb. Tart apple and raspberry. Lots of funk. A very distinct earthiness and plenty of oak. Surprisingly I can pick up on some hops about halfway through. A puckering tartness lingers. I like it a lot. 
M - Smooth and light-bodied.
D - Tough to rate as these aren't session beers for me. It is very quenching but I don't think I''d care for much more than what is in the 375 ml bottle. 
Overall, a fantastic beer that I am joyous to have had the opportunity to drink. If I am in RR's neck of the woods I would probably seek out another bottle but at a $17 price tag I won't be stocking up. 849 charactersb3barron, Mar 08, 2009

Lots of time these type of brews have weird color, this one pulls it off. Amazing aroma that is very complex, funk, bright and muddled red fruits. Acidity / sour is bam! which should evolve well in bottle. Less than beatification and more than temptation for my palate. Lots of upside, some oak tannin. Nice finish, long and the sourness carries thru and brings the flavors along with it. Very nice and distinct. 479 characterspaytoplay, Mar 04, 2009

A slow pout produces a amber brown with an off-white fluffy head. Smells of apples and white wine. Light musky malts smell too. Taste is intense! A very tart flavor. Makes my checks tingle. Tastes like it smells: apples and white wine. I can defiantly taste the malts too. The oak barrels definitely help bring all the flavors together. Plenty of balancing hops that increases the viscosity of my saliva. Mouth feel is light with lots of carbonation. If you let it wonder, you can feel the bubbles form all over your tongue and mouth. Drinkability is better than most wine/beers. I think the aging in oak barrels have contributed to the drinkablilty. 734 charactersBeerStine, Feb 17, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to ricand for hooking this one up.
A - Appears amber, gold, or orange - the lighting can really play tricks with the color of this beer. Head is just off white and rises to just under half inch. Retention looks good. Lacing is average.
S - Apples and grape skins are evident right out of the gate. Sweeter aromas come through next. Could be caramel and candied sugar. Musty and funky toward the end. Smells a little like old dried up wood.
T - This is where the cherries come in. Mix them with some grapes and that is how the flavor starts out. A hefty dose of oak really comes through well in the flavor and adds a nice compliment to the fruitiness. Oak is quickly followed by the Brett, imparting a very earthy feel. Some malt sweetness comes and goes with hints of caramel and maybe brown sugar. 
M - Medium bodied with a nice carbonation level that stays fairly active but doesn't really get in the way. Finish is tart and smooth at the same time. 
D - Drinkability is good. The big tart flavors and complexity of this brew make it a candidate for a sipper. The cherries add something different and unique to this brew and pushes the drinkability up a notch. As it warms the Brett flavors start to smooth out and some brown ale qualities start to come through. This is another winner from Russian River. Highly recommended. 1,339 characterscsmiley, Feb 15, 2009

smell is big on the sour cherries with a nice hint of oak. smell isnt over the top with the sourness but just enough to get me excited. 
taste is very nice. complexities of the sour cherry and oak flavors hit me up front and leave me with a slight sour/sweet finish. very nice. 
mouth is smooth and light. a nice pucker but not going out of its way to slap you in the face with it.

A: Brown body with reddish hints. small off white head, little lacing.
S: Sour cherries, oak, apple cider, slightly wine-like in feel.
T: This is the epitome of wine smoothness and beer complexity. Sour and tart fruits up front, with a hint of bitterness. Lots of cherry flavors. Some wine like acidity from the barrel aging. Delicious.
M: Smooth. Flavors seamlessly transition on the tongue. The tart and sourness is not overwhelming, but distinctive enough to make this beer special.

Color was a dull gold with a light white head. Smells of tart fruits, cherry, apple, sourness. A very drinkable sour, less biting than a flanders or some of RR's other sours, medium bodied, and less fruits in the taste than I expected. Good stuff. 404 charactersantilogic, Feb 02, 2009

Appearance:
Poured into my Duval Tulip, lots of bubbles with a 2 finger white head. No lacing. Brilliant clear copper color when held to the light. You can see a little sediment but not much. Overall the beer looks clear with its golden copper color.
Smell:
Vinegar is very dominant and the first aroma I can detect. I also smell some apple and a slight funk. 
Taste:
Taste is same as smell, tons of vinegar upfront but fades into sour apple or cherry. I can also taste the oak and I get a tart finish that lingers on the tongue. All around smooth the blend is balanced, not much complexity in this brew.
Feel:
The carbonation is strong but helps with the vinegar taste, like a sparkling wine.
Overall:
I don't have much to compare this to since this is my first attempt at this style. I have to say I enjoyed it considering this was totally different. It was very drinkable and especially nice with my cheese and crackers. I would have liked to have gotten a bit more sour apple/cherry flavors. I can't wait to try Temptation next! 1,047 charactersMASPuros, Feb 02, 2009

A loud, angry pop was heard as the cork flew off this one and hit the ceiling in his basement. Batch # 3 in the 375ml format.
Pours a slightly cloudy, light brown with a white, tightly compacted head. Good amoeba-like lacing up the side of my over-sized Duvel snifter and great head retention.
Smells of ripe, tart cherries, possibly some lightmalts and even a touch of nut brown nuttiness.
High, spicy carbonation as it hits my mouth, reminiscent of sticking pop rocks in your mouth! Sparkling mouthfeel. Slightly sweet and very crisp. Light bodied and unique medium to full flavored. Sourness is the predominant quality, but extremely smooth.
Very nice and worth the hype! Go out and try this! 874 charactersbeachbum1975, Jan 30, 2009

Looks a murky brown/gold, like unfiltered apple cider. Head is small, but I made an admittedly gentle pour.
Smells fantastic. Wine, apples, vinegar. Beautiful.
Tastes of apples, sour goodness, other fruits dancing in the background, but very crisp. Incredible stuff. 
Mouth is spot on, thin/med with relatively high carbonation.

S: Apple cider vinegar, pears, oak, some funky mushroom/earthy aromas in the background. 
T: Lots going on here. Similar to a flanders red style but lighter, smoother... flavors of red wine, oak barrel, cherries, maybe a bit of tobacco. Finish is tart with hints of vinegar, but composed. Very smooth, refreshing.

Sampled while sitting on the patio in beautiful Bodega, Ca. Looking out at the Pacific Ocean. That's right. Listening to Mark Lanegan's "Bubblgum". Good times right here.
Poured from a 375ml bottle into a snifter. Pours out a rusty/amber color with a creamy tan/of white colroed head. The head stays around for quite some time. Not much lacing or webbing left on glass.
Smeels quite tart, fruity, funky, musty, yowza, brett.
This is something. Tart fruit & cherry, mouth puckering tartness, wine like complexity, bready malt, nice sweetness, noticeable wood character. The wood & tart/sour play nicely. Possibly the most complex beer I've had to date. I likey.
Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, dry, lingering sourness.
To say I enjoyed & savored every gulp would be an understatement. Worthy of the hype & kudos this brew gets. 849 charactersbbothen, Jan 21, 2009

Batch #003 bottle poured into a snifter produced a finger worth white head that went to a good layer of lace. The body of the brew was interesting reddish brown/ amber, if that's a color 
Aromas of sour cherries are really evident. Nice wood aromas as well as wonderfully funky yeast. It reminded me a lot of a Rodenbach
Flavors of a dry white wine and sour cherries this stuff is great. Light, crisp and dry in the mouth 
 Drinkability on a sour is a strange question; yes its drinkable but how much sours can one take. I'm glad I decided to crack this one open tonight I have been really missing the sours and it was easy to finish this bottle of myself 704 charactersjoepais, Dec 24, 2008

It wasn't on the beer list but we asked and lucked out. Poured from a 375ml cool shaped bottle into a snifter. The lighting wasn't great since a bar but looked ciderish in color and texture. Some carb and slight lacing. It had about a finger of white head that settled into a foam with collar.
The aroma was exceptional. I love sour beers and this one has the classic smell. No one does it better than RRBC. The brett really stands out. Also had wine undertones. The taste was also exceptional. Had a great sour bite with a slight dry finish. Absolutely perfect. The mouthfeel had the great sour bite with the tingling of the carb so a great mix.
Overall, a world-class beer that deserves to be so highly ranked. My mission in life is to find more of this beer - now! I could have just drank this all night but this ended up being the first in a classic night of beer drinking at Falling Rock. Most highly recommend - get one now....wait, don't get one as that would leave less for me. 1,093 charactersTexIndy, Dec 15, 2008

Pours a slightly cloudy orangey amber with a bubbly white head that sticks around forever. I can smell the sour from here while I'm pouring, yum. Upon closer inspection many layers reveal themselves to my nostrils. There's the sour funk, the cherries, the spicy Belgian yeast, bready malt. Just wonderful smelling really. Taste is sour lemons, limes, green apples, some cherries, a bit of acid. Any trace of malt or yeast gets buried in the sour while tasting. Sour fruits galore, but not overpowering. Incredibly drinkable. Very dry finish. Crisp Carbonation, medium body, Creamy dry mouthfeel. Wow this is good!

Pours a golden/honey color, minimal beige head, but I poured slowly, as per the bottle's instructions. A few spots of lacing hanging in there. Smells of white wine, yeast, sour cherry. Taste is extremely sour, intense green apples and cherries, maybe some pear as well. Crazy puckering and drying mouthfeel.

Pours a slightly hazy brownish amber with a bubbly off-white head that remains a cap throughout and leaves very good lacing.
The aroma is wonderfully complex with sour red cherries on a big bready malt base with hints of citrus, lemons especially. The wood character is evident as well and hints of funk as well, but not overpowering.
The taste is just as nice with a lip-puckering sour kick up front with cherries and bits of lemony funk. The background malts really support the sourness well and the finish is nice and dry with lots of wood and vanilla. The brett kicks it up a notch in the taste and makes the taste very nice all the way around.
The mouthfeel has clearly been influenced by the barrels as it is dry and wine-like in the finish. It's still nice and creamy with strong carbonation though.
This is a fantastic example of a style that I'm really not into. It says a lot that I really enjoyed this one despite my palate not quite being ready for sours yet. Get some now. 1,028 charactersgford217, Dec 01, 2008

Supplication pours amber colored with a slight reddish tinge when held to light. Aroma is dominated by a strong musty character with perhaps a touch of cherry but not much. Mouthfeel is very dry and tart. Flavorwise, it it has a "clean" sourness (lacto-dominate?) with just a bit of cherry and almond. Displays less complexity than the best sour beers. I was expecting more cherry and funk.
Overall, worth a try but to me not among the very best of sour beers. 549 charactersmarksto, Nov 27, 2008

MF: Puckery, fairly vigirous carbonation, flavors balance out nicely

This beer has a nice sour aroma. Viniger, but not in a bad way. Some citrus fruit too. Some tart cherries. Very nice.
Wow, this beer is good. It is very tart and sour. I taste some sweet cherries. The wood make a slight appearence in the flavor. And some vinigery sourness.
This beer is highly carbonated. It leaves a sour aftertaste. 
This beer would probably make a good session beer. It is pretty aggressive, but I think I could drink it all night. I would be able to taste the last one as much as the first, unlike extremely hoppy beers.
Overall: Batch 3. This beer is everything I was hoping for. I love it. This is exactly the way I wanted to celebrate the news I got today about being selected for advancement to E6. A perfect end to a great day. 879 charactersOStrungT, Nov 20, 2008

A - Looks so good in the snifter. 1 finger of white suds atop a crystal clear, ruby red, ultra-effervescent body. Beautiful.
S - Brings back memories of Enigma. Oak, wine, sour cherries, cinnamon, Brett.
T - Incredible. Super tart cherries, dry, oaky finish, coupled with a puckering sourness. Tons of complex, Bretty/earthy notes peek in and sneak about during the drink. The more you drink of it, the more the subtle nuances come to the surface, such as the underlying brown ale, green sour apples, and spices. The thing is, it's a lot "cleaner" than a lot of the sours I've tasted prior. Vinnie really understands these wild little monsters.
M - Thinner, and crisp/sparkly. It's spot on.
D - Sourness is the only thing that could be considered a limiter. This beer is near perfect in every way.
Notes: Is it better than Enigma? Maybe. But is it worth the price of admission? Not so much. Enigma was like, $9 or $10 for a FOUR PACK. This was $15 I think? Crazy.

D: Flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, even though I'm not a big fan of the sour beers, I can appreciate the fact that this is a well-made beer. It's well worth drinking for a while if you're in the mood for the sour style. 950 charactersTheManiacalOne, Nov 08, 2008

Bright with carbonation, maybe even a little too much. The RR sour taste is nice and cleaner than many other sours. Burns all the way down to the stomach, which is the only thing that decreases drinkability. 325 characterstprokop7, Nov 08, 2008
4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow, another fantastic brew from Russian River. Pours a hazy orangish brown with a creamt light beige head. Good lacing. 
The nose has the usual tart fruits over subtle malts, musky oak, red wine and ripe mountain cherries. 
Taste also has a near perfect blend between the sweet, sour and funky flavors. The cherries and wine barrels are a very nice addition to this ale. 
Crisp body and delicate carbonation fit the style perfectly. Like I said, another artisinal creation from Vinnie. 489 charactersrye726, Oct 31, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 12.7 oz. bottle (Batch 003) received in a trade with Jw347 into a snifter.
Appears brownish orange in color with a one inch off-white head. A bit of spotty lacing is left behind.
Aroma is very tart, cherries are evident but not overpowering. Behind the sour is a nice sweet scent.
Taste is very sour at first and it kind of took me by surprise and gave me the chills. The sips afterward are still dominated by sourness reminiscent of tart cherries and granny smith apples. Tons of wonderfully funky flavors that I can't really describe. There's a woody taste that always seems to be slightly present. This stuff is tasty as hell.
Mouthfeel is medium with a very nice carbonation that allows the flavors to really show off their stuff.
By far the best sour I have tried, excellent. Looking forward to the bottle of Beatification I have in my fridge as well. 875 charactersroadhouse, Oct 27, 2008

Apricot caramel color. Huge white head. Tons of tiny bubbles. IT'S ALIVE!! This is one busy ass beer. The head tries to relax a little but the upward swell of bubbles keeps it going.
Mouth wateringly sour smell. Unable to pick out the particulars because I'm a maroon, but collectively speaking, this puppy is sow-wah!
Taste is Extra Sour. I'm talking pucker-fucker sour. Probably the best tasting sour outta the five or six I've tried. Sours are such a masochistic style. Like habanero salsa. First reaction is 'shit that hurts' and second reaction is 'give me some more.'
Again I'm at a loss to describe the feel of a sour. Too busy puckering, but I think I notice some carbonation. Finishes quite dry. Gives a certain flatulent feeling to the belly. Or that might be the raisin bran I had for breakfast. Either way, something wicked this way comes.
Overall: not everyday but makes for a rare treat 1,000 charactersPatronWizard, Oct 27, 2008

A: Light reddish color, hazy. Virtually no head nor lacing
S: Tart cherries. A mild funk in the background but it's very subtle
T/M: Exactly like it smells. Tart cherries. A little tarter than I remember. A little earthiness, probably from the Brett even though I don't know for sure what that tastes like. Medium bodied and dry. Really good stuff.
D: I really enjoy this beer and could probably drink a couple of glasses. But too many sours in one night has me craving malty sweetness soon thereafter.
An excellent beer. Like this the most of the RR sours. 671 charactersabfraser, Oct 27, 2008

A: A crisp golden, with the finish adding a bit of haziness between a couple glasses. Moderate head of white. 
S: Straight up sour cherry, somewhat peppery. 
T: Tart cherry flavours, some notes of apple (sour apple), a soft spiciness and the slightest bit of funk and woodiness.
M: Very dry... Crisp. Leaves very little behind, amazingly clean. I love me a dry drink, especially when they are tart/sour

4.44/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle from BrewerB, poured into a wine glass, split three ways. Thanks!
Appearance: A gorgeous, slightly hazy orange amber body with a nice amount of lacing, an attractive head, 
Aroma: Mild but very interesting. Mild sweet cherry, definite Brett, cinnamon, spice, sweet golden honey, floral leafy notes, light fruity esters, and a sweet woody note. It's very delicate and subdued, but very complex.
Taste: Tart, and wonderfully dry. There's TONS of wood here - more so than in many other beers, almost like chewing on a stick at some points - and loads of fruity esters. Crisp, dry granny smith apple skins, Concord grapes, tons of funk - smells like a funky cinnamon cherry pie. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium-bubbled, fluffy, soft, powdery, puffy. 
Drinkability: I'm still not completely on board with this whole wild ale thing - it's a slow and steady acclimation process, as with any new style. That being said, this was a pretty enjoyable beer in my opinion. It was absolutely incredible smelling, not nearly as tart as some wild ales I've (enjoyed/been subjected to), and overall a very pleasant experience, with a completely manageable abv. Recommended. 1,170 charactersCrellMoset, Sep 24, 2008

4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to brent56k for the opportunity. Batch 003.
A: Poured a golden copperish color. Very different than the other wild ales I have had from Russian River. Reminds me of Tornado 20th but a few shades lighter. Poured with a 1/2 finger of white head. Good head retention especially for the style.
S: Nice mix of funk/ sweetness and cherries. The funk is subtle but definitely there. The horse blanket is in the way back but it is there.
T: The tartness is caught right on the front of your tongue. Totally up front. Almost like a sweet tart. Little bit of sweetness from the cherries after that. I wouldn't say it is balanced but it is enjoyable. This is nice and tart but more balanced than Beatification I would say.
M: Little bit thicker than other wild ales I have had. Probaly a result of this starting out as a brown ale. Carbonated well.
D: God damn it. Why can't beers like this be on the shelves of the store. That being said this is a treat. The cherries and the fact that it was a brown ale blend everything nicely. A good starter for someone wanting to try a wild ale. I find that Russian River nails that tart sourness better than just about everyone. 1,169 charactersaerozeppl, Sep 20, 2008

4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5(from notes taken early august 2008)
my brother got this in a trade with brewerb
batch 003. poured into small tulip
amber honey color with orange tint. slight haze. nice head, slowly fades to thin, wispy layer. very nice lacing.
white wine and champagne aromas. hints of vinegar, mild barnyard and hay. estery apple and grape, trace of sour cherries. some yeastiness, plus whiff of phenols and wood at the back.
for the palate, the mild cider vinegar/sour cherry tartness, along with fruity apple and champagne grape note melds into that woody and phenolic end. meanwhile, grassy hop bitterness is mild to moderate, peaking right after a moment of farmhose funk, and then eases into a dry, tart finish.
not thin at all. lots of acidic texture behind an overall smoothness. mild carbonation can give a refreshing prickliness to accentuate the initial tartness.
this is a wonderful beer. of all three russian river wild ales i've tried so far, this is the one that i can say is certainly worth EVERY penny. 1,011 characterschinabeergeek, Sep 14, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 001. Rusted orange peel with edges of polished brass gleaming under candlelight. The sandstone colored cap has plenty of character, even if it isn't as awe-inspiring as it might have been. A few patches of sudsy lace grace the upper reaches of the glass... while the final pour brings a darker, murkier look that is immensely appealing.
The nose is unquestionably awe-inspiring and lets the sniffer know what's in store when it comes time to soak the taste buds. The word complexity seems horribly inadequate. How about complex complexity? Brown malt, sour cherries and microbe-generated funk. It's all present and it smells fandamntastic!
Supplication is beautiful beer. I don't care how long it took Vinnie to create it (more than one year according to the rear label), it was time well spent. It's obvious that the flavor has held up perfectly well. The body/mouthfeel might be a different story. However, since this is my first bottle, it's impossible to say for sure.
According the Russian River website, this batch is supposed to be less acidic and acetic than subsequent batches. I think it's just right in that regard. Any more acid and flavor and drinkability would have taken a hit. The website also says that cherries are more prominent in 001. It's great that tart fruit dominates, even with so much else going on.
As for the bugs, Brettanomyces was used, as were Lactobacillus and Pediococcus. The horse blanket characteristics of Brett are obvious, as are the smelly feet charcteristics added by the two bacteria. What cheesemakers have known for millenia, brewers are just beginning to discover. That's nothing but good news for craft beer lovers.
The flavor profile is a kaleidoscope of deliciousness. It includes brown malt, fermented sour cherries, a shot of oak-soaked Pinot Noir, fruit vinegar and a lovely funkiness that is anything but overpowering. Warming doesn't change much, but then the beer was mind-blowingly deep right out of the chute.
I'm still not sure what sort of mouthfeel an American wild ale should have. This one is light-medium and the carbonation lacks softness. It still fits the beer very well, however, which is the biggest reason why it hasn't been penalized too severely.
Supplication (noun): humble prayer, entreaty or petition. Mr. Cilurzo, I humbly ask that you do whatever is in your power to return to the days when those of us who reside outside of California were able to have Russian River beer delivered to our homes. Supplication is well worth its lofty ranking on The Top Beers on Planet Earth. 2,564 charactersBuckeyeNation, Sep 09, 2008

375ml bottle, corked and caged. batch 003. sampled august 17/08.
bottle opens with a hefty pop. pours murky reddish orange with a small head of fine white bubbles. the head quickly drops to a ring around the glass, with a small patch in the center from the etching on the bottom of my chimay glass.
aroma is great. as soon as i opened the bottle i could smell it. tart cherry. cider vinegar. lemon. leather. horse blanket. green tobacco leaves. oak and vanilla. white wine. light citrus. bread and cracker. bit of grain. can't wait for the taste!
taste is excellent. intense puckering sourness at first, quickly fading to a nice light citrus sweetness. lemon and cider vinegar that becomes more tangerine and orange peel. slightly acidic, but not overpowering. after a few sips i become accustomed to the sourness and can see a little deeper into it. white bread and a bit of cracker. faint sour cherry. bit of leather and horse blanket funk, but a little less than i expected from the aroma. it plays well with the other elements here. earthy and slightly herbal, bringing in that tobacco element again. vanilla and raw oak. white wine. green grapes. light alcohol. as it warms a little more caramel and nutty character comes out too. wow, i think i'm in love.
mouthfeel is great. medium high carbonation level that feels a bit higher due to some sting from the acidity, but once you grow accustomed to the acidity you can see that it's not quite as high. body is about medium, but with a fairly clean dry finish.
drinkability is great. the interplay and balance between all the elements here is superb. the depth and complexity keeps you going back for more. i wish i had a case of this so i could just keep drinking it... 1,968 charactersgrub, Aug 18, 2008

Finally time to supplicate. Pours a nice clear brownish red with a white fizzy head. Nose is balls out sour funk with some oak and very slight maltiness. Taste follows with typical wild RR flavor. Lovin the brown ale base here, as it adds an interesting subtle flavor to the brew. some light fruit flavor in here, but mostly a brett funk face melter. mouthfeel is nice, a little thicker than you average wild. Drinkability is second to few or none, as are all the RR sours i have yet tried. Thanks again mac to the Murch. 557 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Aug 18, 2008

Batch 003
I was lucky enough to have errantnight pick me up a few of these from the brewery shortly after the last release, thanks Derek! Supplication fills the tulip a murky hazy deep crimson with hints of earth. The body glows with orange highlights when backlit but the murkiness is consistent. Tiny carbonation bubbles rush up the sides of the glass to the dirty beige head. A nice looking fingers worth of head formed on a soft pour and manages to stick around for the remainder of the drink. The head also seems to have a slight pinkish tint to it. Sheet lacing and drink lines are left down the glass. This is an excellent looking beer.
The brett is the first thing that hits my nose. Cobwebs and damp farmhouse soil are both mild but certainly present. There's tartness from the cherries which flow seamlessly into a mouthwatering sourness. The nose is very earthy with notes of wood, leathery qualities, and mustiness. The aroma of this beer is all around inviting and simply mouthwatering. Vinous wine like qualities takes a ghost like foothold in the background of this beer. 
The tartness is right upfront but falls short of sour; it will get you to pucker slightly. The cherries used come around as soon as this beer hits my tongue along with the damp soil and acetic acid. The tartness seems to fade as time goes by and there's a touch of sweetness that keeps things reasonably balanced. The oak comes through nicely as this beer warms and the vinous qualities join the fun. All the flavors really come together as this beer begins to warm and the sweet/ sour characteristics play off each other very nicely.
The carbonation in this beer is spot on. It's aggressive and quick moving but soft enough to keep from being prickly. The body is on the lighter side of the spectrum and becomes airy the second it hits the tongue. The finish is dry and leaves me wanting more.
Like I said earlier each drink leaves me wanting another right away. Supplication is very thirst quenching and the sweet and sour flavors keep me coming back for more. I can see the acidity causing some problems over a long period of drinking though.
Supplication is another wonderful creation from Russian River. The levels of tartness along with the semi-sweet qualities make this a great beer. Very thirst quenching with a little of that puckering ability. Thanks for picking these up for me Derek! 2,403 charactersjoe1510, Aug 17, 2008
4.13/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On draught at Belmont Station, served in a chimay goblet, Supplication is a gorgeous pale burgundy rose, with a small white head that leaves light lace. 
Smell is pretty funky, a lactic sourness and touch of musty brett horseblanket, with touches of wine and tropical fruits, limes in particular, it sweetens as it warms. 
Taste is tart but not overly sour (well at least compared to the last RR sour I had, Beatification), lots of acidity, which is my favorite sour component, citrusy but not particularly vinous, or woody for that matter. Maybe not the most complex wild ale, but it's very tasty and hitting the spot on this 100F day. 
Mouthfeel is spritzy and dry, with a medium body and some lingering tannins, which seem to be the main contributions from the wine barrel aging. 
Drinkability is very nice, flavorful and acidic without being overly sour or sweet, no vinegar notes either, it's really close to my taste in wild ales, well made, and gets bonus points for rarity, especially on draught! 1,008 charactersccrida, Aug 15, 2008

WHOA- the smell is pungent. As soon as I open the beer you can get a whiff from across the room. I get a lot of vinegar, some musty red wine, some alcohol and the barnyard as well on the nose. Smell is consistenty strong throughout.
Tast is similar. I get the huge pucker of the sour cherries, vinegar etc. right up front. Aftertaste mellows it quite a bit and makes it even more enjoyable. Bit of alcohol on the end.
Nice champagne fizz on the mouthfeel.
Fairly drinkable for the style- has a lot going on throughout the beer and my mouth is pretty puckered after this one. 796 charactersDrDogbeer, Aug 09, 2008

M - thin and bubbly with a "10% juice" backbone (i guess that means slight syrup underneath)

A: Amber/orange pour that fizzled like champagne when poured. The body is translucent, but a tady hazy at the same time. Poured effervecence lingers to form a lily pad of head that has centered in my glass.
S: Perfectly-soured cherries! A nice aroma pronounces the said added fruit along with light grapefruit. 
T: Puckering sour deliciousness. Magnificence abounds. Cherries punch out again, as well as brilliant sour familiarity that has come to be expected from RR. 
M: A rich, sweet liquid pours over my tongue, across palate and swirls down throat. Perfectly balanced flavors drink extremely well. 
D: Rarity and scarceness should not stop you from obtaining/relishing/savoring/enjoying this offering from RR. Amazing! I will jump at the opportunity to enjoy this beer again. 915 charactersd0ggnate, Aug 01, 2008
4.89/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I got this bottle of batch 00s thanks to a trade with Tayner. Thanks Dana!
It pours a hazy peach colour with a 1" head of foam.There's some good lacing and foam is shrinking but looks like some of it will be around at the end of the session. Ok, the foam did leave the scene entirely but, what the hell..
The smell is just what I like to find in American Wild Ales...huge sour notes from cherries and lemons. Also a big yeasty profile with some vanilla and oak. Super nice nose.
The taste is as good if not better than the nose. Wow. Big oaky and yeasty notes with some yeasty tones and big fruity tartness from lemons, apricots, and cherries. There's also an underlying sweetness coming from vanilla. And did I mention the funk? No? My bad. The Brett is definitely present here working its magic, intertwining with all the other luscious flavours. and bringing real justice to the style.
Marvelous, simply marvelous. The mouthfeel is medium, the carbonation is brisk but fits this ale so well, and it finishes with that sour cherry tartness that just demands that I take another sip tout suite. Eminantly drinkable for me, to say the least.
This is a world class brew in my book and thanks go out again to Dana for sending this my way! 1,241 charactersBitterbill, Jul 20, 2008

Smells of oak, vanilla, some cherry, orange or lemon rind and a strong acidic sourness/tartness. A feast for the nose. 
Tartness right from the beginning. Sour and citric, a bit musty and cetainly fruity. Pineapple impressions in the middle and finish. Oak is there throughout, but it is not overpowering. Puckering and lip smacking. 
Very dry to the mouth, with a bit of body and ready carbonation. Acidic in the finish, leaves as much after-feel as aftertaste.
I like it, very much, but thinking about more than one bottle at a time is not appealing. That being said, I'm sure the brewer didn't intend this beer to be sessioned. Something to savour for sure, if you are a fan of sourness, this will test just how much of a fan you are. 927 characterselricorico, Jul 16, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 003
Pours orange with amber highlights with a big airy head that laces nicely. Active carbonation consistently wells up in the center of the tulip glass, pushing it's way through the head to the surface.
Smells of acidic fruits and yeast are met with a big blast of tart lighter fruits on the tongue. Slight apricot mixed with green apple quickly gets taken over by a big ball of sour funk that fades into a very slight grain note that then transitions back to some slight wood tannins and more tartness. The cherries are here but they are far from taking over, I think they've added more in the way of color (which was just awesome, love the way this beer looks in the glass).
The finish is dry and crisp and is carried along the whole way by a wonderful blend of carbonation and tartness, body is medium. I wish that this bottle was twice the size that it was, but I'll relish the fact that I've got a few more waiting. Just a highly drinkable and highly enjoyable brew. 981 charactersgwood, Jul 15, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Big thankyou goes to jw347 for sending this bottle my way. This will be my first time drinking a beer from Russian River Brewing Company. Poured in to a wide mouthed wine glass a strawberry color, with a very nice, sizable white head show. Aroma is wonderfully funky, with those micro bacteria showing themselves early on. Lemon juice, sour cherry, vinegar, and a slight dry champaign character are in there too. Taste hits the palate with a wave of sour funk, tart fruit, and a lovely, almost spicy feel. Carbonation is just right, giving it even more of a champaign feel. This is one to let warm up a bit as well, as many more complexities push themselves forward. Drinkability is quite good for this style, as the carbonation helps things out. For me, this resembles a Cantillon beer, which is very impressive, because their beers are so complex. I would say that if anyone wants to get an idea of what this beer tastes like, to grab some Cantillon, assuming that it is available in your area. This is an exceptional wild ale. I cannot wait to try some of the other offerings from Russian River. Cheers 1,105 charactersjamie2dope, Jul 15, 2008

Batch 003
 The color is a beautiful orange-hued amber, the center of the crown is eruptive and active as hell with quick streaming bubbles, a good sign of lively yeast.Not much of a crown as it rises and falls quickly but plenty of bubbly foam remains.
 The nose has a sharpness, very bitter and tart cherries, dry-earth scent, subtle, spicey hop, slightly medicinal. Brett!!
 The flavor is a wild-yeast tartness that brings along sour cherries, citric and acidic fruitiness, much like young, wild concorde grapes. The ending dry and slightly bitter, but earthy bitter...not hop bitter. This is a light feel, crisp and Belgian-like smoothness at the end.
 I'm all for pushing the bounds of yeast! Go Wild! 745 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Jul 09, 2008

Brew pours out golden with racing carbonation & a filmy appearance. Smells of funk & cherries. 
Wow! Holy James Brown in a green suit! This has some serious funk, my first close encounter with the UFO that is brett. Plenty of pine & funk, with a mild undertow of cherries. I'm not sure if it's the brett or the carbonation or what, but the stuff puts a charge into the roof of my mouth, numbing it, & my lips start to tingle. This is either potent stuff or I better seek immediate medical attention. 
Drinkability isn't there. I split this small bottle with the wife & the small pour was enough. I lick my numb lips to get the last drops. I guess that's a good sign. 
I don't feel I need another, but already I'm wondering about the Avery Fifteen in the cellar & the Riserva that's headed my way via FedEx. I need to try more of this Wild Ale thing. 968 charactersmaximum12, Jul 08, 2008

I'll keep this brief since many have already covered what I want to say. This is an exceptional sour beer. The oaken cherry funkiness was just plain outstanding. This was from batch 003.
This was, of course, very sour... cherries, lemon, yeasty. It finished very smooth after the initial pucker when you have your first sip.
I had this after an hour walk on an 85 degree day, but I still found this beer amazingly drinkable. In fact, I had several gulps.
Do what you can to try some Russian River sours. Supplication is the epitome of what an American wild ale/sour beer should be. 629 charactersrudylaw, Jul 06, 2008

Pours a big whopping 3 finger head, may want to pour easier on this one. Light brown to copper color and cloudy for the appearance.
The nose is that of sweetness, cherries, candies, and some yeastiness as well
Mouthfeel WOW! this is one helluva sour beer. At first the sweetness hits the mouth then the sour packs a whopper of a punch. Made me feel like my asshole was being sucked through my mouth GEEZ! the puckerness factor.
This is an amazing sour beer. Its a must try for anyone who calls themselves a beer nerd or beer geek. This really is a beer that is on the extreme side. 639 charactersBgThang, Jul 05, 2008
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a .375L bottle to a snifter the liquid is medium copper with very good carbonation. The head is tall, white and leaves nice lace. 
The smell is typical Russian River Sour, wild yeasty and plenty of cherries. This could be my favorite from this brewer.
The taste follows with a huge tart sourness and I love the Cherries. Low funkiness also adds to the great flavor.
The mouthfeel is good, nice body and very good carbonation.
The drinkability is very good, I really like this brew, It will be fun to cellar a few.

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This poured an orangish copper in color with tinges of red and brown. It had a fluffy head of beige bubbles with faded to leave some island lacing from the constant bubbles. The nose showed off the sour cherries along with other red fruits, "brown" wood and an herbal funkiness. In the mouth this is extremely sour and acidic with the tart cherries being the domminate flavor and a tannic grip on the finish. While acidic, the midpalate does come off as balanced with a nice combination of carbonation and supple edges. 519 charactersSQNfan, Jun 26, 2008

4.49/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottled in a corked 375 ml bottle from Batch 001.
This thing is a beautiful reddish brown hue.
A very carbonated Burnt amber color holds a foamy head for a good amount of time.
A boastfull aroma knocks the nose with alot a unfamiliar smells from the wild yeast. Sour cherries dominate with just a touch of ground pepper and sweet rotting wood.
The tartness will make you pucker and the tastbuds are bonbarded with sour cherries. You can pick up the vanilla and dry wine from the oak barrel. The head is still lingering around to enhance each sip as it rolls back through the pallett.
Pairing this with a nice rare cut of red meat will bring out some additional characters in the beer. Enjoy this one for awhile, let it warm up a bit and hang on. 749 charactersdbONE, Jun 19, 2008

Batch #3, poured into a Duvel tulip.
This pours out an opaque deep golden, almost orange with a huge fluffy persistent head that finall falls to a 1/4 but never fully dissolves... Beautiful.
What a funky aroma! This is truly a first for me...and I love it! Surprisingly I smell some maltiness that is immediately followed by a blast of sour cherries and funkiness... I can definitely smell the pinot noir and the oakiness... it seems like I can smell some old leather too..
Whew!! This is bracingly sour and funky at first with the cherries bombarding my senses but soon enough it mellows out into a smooth vinousness that seems to end with that earthy funky leather I was smelling..it finishes quite dry and leaves me wanting another sip..this is a crazy brew...
My first Russian River brew and I actually liked it more than I thought I would. I was expecting to sort of think it might be ok but hell, it seemed like the more I sipped, I couldn't wait for more...very unusual but in a very good way..
Thanks again to Grant for the opportunity to try this!! 1,123 charactersTilley4, Jun 18, 2008
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: It's a very attractive golden brown color. A little hazy. Sitting atop is a white, foamy finger and a half head. It stuck around for a bit and left a nice, spotty coat of lace lining the glass. Really nice looking beer.
Smell: The addition of Brettanomyces is immediately noticeable on the nose. It's pretty funky smelling. It also has a strong fruity and sour presence. Very impressive. The fruity aroma is mostly attributable to cherry. There's clearly a spicy element as well, though this nose is not capable of distinguishing the particular spices. Toward the end, the oak or wood smell emerges and really caps it off nicely.
Taste: Initially, it's very tart and tastes like sour cherries. It's a little maltier than I expected. Malts add some sweetness and blend really well with the strong tart flavor. Again, there's some spicy flavors in there, but I can't identify them. They're subtle but really add a lot to the flavor. It also has a nice grainy aspect. It finishes tart and the oaked or wood flavor kicks in and appears to dry it out quite a bit. 
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied and extremely smooth. I'm really tempted to pull the "5" trigger on feel, but it's not quite there. Almost though...damn close. Given its abv is 7%, it's very drinkable. I could tackle two or three of these with no trouble. It's very engaging and inviting.
Supplication's another fine beer from Russian River. I characterized Beatification as "art in a bottle" and this is no different. These really are special beers. Russian River's the most artistic brewery I've encountered. Their beers are really unlike anything else I've tried. Truly special and unique. Hopefully they'll distribute on a more widespread basis someday. 1,753 charactersprototypic, Jun 16, 2008

A: The ale is a reddish brown color, like grenadine in orange juice only with a little less haze. A finger plus of highly carbonated foam has left spots of lace around the mouth.
S: Aroma-wise, the ale is just plain funky. The barnyard aromas are hard to avoid, filling the nose with sour cherries, pepper and apple butter.
T: The tartness here surpasses the bite of Temptation, scalding the tastebuds with each sip. Sour cherries follow the tartness, adding a little more depth to the taste. Red wine and vanilla finish out the taste. The ale is incredibly carbonated, adding to the lively taste with each sip.
M: The ale is quite dry from the barrel aging. That, in conjunction with the wild yeasts, creates a beer that stabs the tastebuds with each sip. The complexity is present but you have to appreciate it.
D: The wood, vanilla and funk are incredible. This is a great beer to sip from a snifter. 957 charactersakorsak, Jun 16, 2008

Very sour aroma with a tangy-citrus aroma with a nice mellow cherry in the background.
SOUOOOUUURRR!!! Love it! Huge random flavors of cherry combined with a nice citrus flavor that is combined with a long lasting oak aroma.
Very tart to the tongue and mouth. Delicious and smooth with a nice tart finish.
Very drinkable but to rare to drink often. Another smashing hit from Russian River. 500 charactersRixBeer, Jun 06, 2008
4.08/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4It pours a pleasant amber color witha nice fluffy slightly off-white head to it. There is a good amount of carbonation rising up giving the head some nice retention. It leaves some fairly thick lacing as it recedes. It has a very dry smell consisting mostly of sour cherries. Notes of a dry white wine give it some nice complexity. 
The first sip is very tart, with a slight cherry finish to it. It definitely has some solid bite to it. The more it warms up the more the wine-like qualities of the beer come through, and the tartness mellows somewhat. Some light phenols and hints of brown sugar are there as well. The carbonation is rich and gives it an excellent mouthfeel. Overall, excellent beer. 701 charactersASymon13, Jun 05, 2008

Pours a nice amber color with slight auburn hue to it, topped with a foamy ring and skim coat of head that lasted the entire glass. clear until the last little pour when i got some yeast into it. Laces nicely. 
Smell is very tart and funky from the second i popped the cork out of the bottle. no denying the sourness of this one without even tasting it. It makes my mouth water just smelling it. 
Taste is sour. I would say tart, but this goes right to the edge of tart and then one step further. once you get your jaws unlocked there are some subtle oak and vanilla flavors along with some sour cherry notes. It has a sour candy sweetness to it that makes it very enjoyable and keeps it from going over the top. It finishes like a dry wine, begging for you to drink more. 
Mouthfeel on this one is good. There is plenty of carbonation to keep this one from being overwhelming while keeping a nice thick film of head for the entire glass. 
As for drinkability, the only reason it does not get a 5 is that it is so hard to come by. I could drink this all day, although it would have to be sipped :) there is no hint of alcohol in this one, completely masked by the tartness. I have a few more of these i wanted to age, but not sure how long i will be able to hold on to them now that i popped the first one open! 1,368 characterstayner, May 29, 2008

A: Pours a nice murky amber hue with a huge rocky head in the proper barrel aged Russian River tulip. Nice tiny bubbles rise to the top to maintain the head. Overall excellent head retention.
S: Wonderful aromas with tons of tart Bing Cherries. You can tell this one is barrel aged as the oak vanilla and sour wine really come thru.
T: Even better than the aroma. This one is worth every dollar I spent to get it shipped to Florida. Tons of tart ripe cherries right from the start. The barrel ageing really comes thru with tons of oak and vanilla. Wow very vineous this is one well crafted brew. Beneath all this there is just a touch of sweetness. I bought a second to trade but I am sorry I will be enoying it myself.
M: Light in body very spritzy. Very guezue like wonderful overall.
D: I love this, glad I shared it but could have enjoyed it myself no problem.

3.38/5  rDev -24.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Poured from a corked and caged bottle into a wine glass.
Appearance - Pours a murky copper color with a picturesque tight white finger length head. Lite lacing on the sides, as it forms small patches in spots.
Smell - Cherries and oak are present immediately. Very sour smell, almost akin to a flemish ale (DUCHESSE DE BOURGOGNE).
Taste & Mouthfeel - Wow! This is a sour beer! It's so tangy and sour you can't really taste much else. Definitely a sweet cheery flavor with a light oakiness to it. Feels very carbonated in the mouth but smooths out quickly, and finishes very dry.
Drinkability - Not quite what I expected. I expected it to be much sweeter and more balanced than just a huge sour tartness. A cool beer for the style, but I don't get all the hype. I could throw one back every once in a while, but not something I would seek out as an elite beer. Too tart to the Extreme for my taste. 901 charactersryrust5301, May 29, 2008

A- Poured a deep burnt copper color with a nice one finger tight white head.
S- Very cherry and a bit of oak. On smelling it seems to have a bit of a sweet and sour nose.
T & M- Very sour. I was expecting this to be sour so it didn't take me by surprise. Its sour upfront but has a mild sweetness to it in the end. i can definitely taste the sour cherries. That's probably the most prevelant. Smooth on the tongue and the good carbonation balance gives it a little spice.
D- I'm definitely not a fan of this style. However for what this beer is trying to accomplish, it does it perfectly. In the right arena this is an exceptional brew. I would probably enjoy this more if it were paired with foods, but I'm just drinking it straight up at the moment. If your into trying new different styles, this is a must. It's the best Wild Ale you'll get. 911 charactersShrLSU, May 29, 2008

Slightly hazy, amber-copper body with a dense finger of dirty khaki head. Great lacing. Intoxicating sourish Brett funk hits the nose first. A bit musty with a tart edge. This lays over toffee-coated cherries and grapes. The winy fruits add a slight powdered sugar sweetness to the nose. Notes of oak and leather as well. Wow.
Taste starts off rather tart and acidic. Lime and cherry tartness make up the most of it. Relentless sourness is backed up by slightly sweet cherries, red wine, and oak. Delicious. Finish remains tart and acidic with residual cherries, leather, vinous grapes, and oak. Very well done. Medium body with a very dry finish. Spritzy, sparkling carbonation. Would love to get more bottles of this! 747 charactersalexgash, May 18, 2008

Nose is all sour, tart fruits, with a bit of citrus & vinegar. MAN this beer is sour! I've only had a couple of sours, but this one really makes the lips pucker. Cherry, raspberry, and lemon all over. After a few sips, the sphincter-tightening sourness subsides somewhat, giving way to a pleasant sweetness, with a dash of bitterness at the end. The finish is crisp, dry, and refreshing. A brew unlike any I've had. And that's a good thing. I'd very much like to see what effect a good year or two of age will have.
Thanks to cloudskipper for the hookup! 662 characters0110x011, May 18, 2008
5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is, in a word, divine. If you believe sour is at the top of the beer-flavor hierarchy, as I do, than this beer is for you. If you don't believe this, well chances are this beer is still for you. It offers a rich amber color, abundant head, delicious aroma, and even better taste. Aroma is citrus-y, sour, candy-sweet, yet somehow (despite what I've already said) balanced and distinctly beer-like. Flavor is distinctly sour, although I've certainly had beers sourer. It has a musty, sweet-tart, clove, complex and delicious. Mouthfeel is excellent.
This is not a beer that is not easy for most of us to get our hands on. However, if you've not had it, you should travel, trade, or attend a festival to get it. 720 charactersBeerBelcher, May 17, 2008

A: Pours a deep murky orange with thin head that leaves very little lacing on the glass.
S: Smell of funkiness and spices with a deep cherry smell. Very little smell of oak but just enough to add a more complex nose leaving you asking...what the hell is that smell?
T/M: One of the most complex beers I have ever had roll across my tongue. The most misleading thing is that I would not relate any brown ale that I have ever had to this beer, yet the more I drink, the more subleties of a brown ale arise. The taste up front is a sour funky cherry taste. This is followed up with a sweet maltness that is hardly apparent but is the one thing that relates to a brown ale. About 1000 different tastes then swirl across your tongue consisting of 1000 different unknowns. I honestly can't begin to describe the tastes but they are delicious and they are there. The mouthfeel is amazing. Not too thin and not too thick, medium...just right! Wonderfully carbonated which adds so much to the beer. 
D: Delicious. I could suck this down all day. The funky taste may get to you after a while but definitely not from this bottle! 1,155 charactersdsigmon, May 17, 2008

Looks great in my Duvel glass, perfect lacing and nice head. Taste is more tart than sour with slight notes of cherry chloraseptic, but not in a bad way, must be the Brett. As it warms, noticeable oak, well balanced. Drinkable? As much as any 12.7 ounce $15 "if you can get it at that price" beer can be. Kind of bummer that it is not more affordable and available. Would love for it to have a chance to grow on me more and perhaps share a little with the wife. Very unique! 601 charactersHopHeadLouie, May 13, 2008

A- Pours a murky, dull coppery orange with a brief appearance of a thin white head. Minimal lacing
S- Some tangy, funky sourness. Able to pick up the woodiness easily. Some medicinal phenols in there.
T- Bright tanginess. Man, some great sourness on my palate. I do appreciate the sour cherries, but they don't jump out "cherries" to me. Mellow woodiness. Some bright citrus at the end.
M- Smooth, with beautiful tanginess. Lively bubbles, gets my salivary glands working.
D- Now while I love this unique RR offering, it has to be in the right setting. This needs to be paired with food, or enjoyed as you would a liquor. I would love to have multiple of these on hand to drink on a whim. 749 charactersm1ked, May 13, 2008

4.73/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought these on-line from Russian River and was generously sent to me by 0110x011. I love Russian River and I especially love these sour wild ales. Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale tulip. Batch 003.
Appearance- Pours a sunset orangeish pink with a nice big two finger bright white head. The head doesn't leave, ever, and the lacing that is left is bewildering thick and coating.
Smell- Mildly sour and tart with that fantastic yeasty wildness. Feint funk that isn't over the top like some of these can be (definitely not saying that in a bad way) and twinges of bright zesty citrus. The cherries are easily detectable and probably the focal point of the nose. A sort of metallic like sensation is given off; reminiscent of the sensation you get when smelling blood or rusted iron. Beautiful nose!
Taste- Beautifully sour and lactic but not puckering or vinegary. The Brett has done its job well on this one but I don't know how it doesn't have that sour lingering tartness that can sometimes make these brews hard to drink more than one. The cherries are sour and raw with a very fresh vibrant taste. The oak woodiness isn't as prominent as I expected but this brew has more acidic wine character than the others like it I've tried. Apparently the pinot noir has really worked its way into this one. Lightly funky and dank this brew is everything I could want in a wild ale. The aftertaste lingers with sweet twang that is lighty vanilla, lightly cherry.
Mouthfeel- Very sharp aggressive carbonation with a fairly hefty body and a dry quenching finish.
Drinkability- This is one of those brews that I could easily enjoy daily and probably not get sick of it. The sourness isn't over the top but it's prevalent enough to satisfy that sour tooth that I've acquired as of late. Terrifically balanced and funky I think this is a absolutely brilliant brew that must be tried! Big thanks to Matt for sending this my way! 1,917 charactersyounger35, May 12, 2008

Begins with a sharp, prickly tartness and lively, acidic fruit over some bread and yeast. Mellows out quickly and layers of lean red fruit come through, with a lot of musty, earthy undertones. Barnyard, straw and wood notes add complexity. Cherry flavors are lean and subtle, but add some red fruit acidity. Mouthfeel is medium/light and a bit creamy. Complexities evolve as it warms, leaning toward juicier red fruit towards the end, with some semi dry sherry flavors. Finish is creamy and dry. Very very nice. As top notch as this is I think its a bit pricey. For $14 it should be a 750. 641 charactersbcm119, May 12, 2008

After having the Beatification last night, I decided to pop this one right after it to see how it was. Batch 003, I grabbed this one right out of the fridge and poured it into a Chimay chalice and allowed it to warm up a touch before deciding to go in for the kill. Huge pop on this one, I probably could have shot the cork across the room! Fantastic looking 375ml bottle, with a nice cork and cage to it in typical Russian River fashion.
Appearance - Poured a very nice looking bright, golden, amber color right out of the gate. A very nice, and slightly hazy looking consistency to it, I did notice copious amounts of bubbles coming up through it, throughout the session. This was a really a very full looking beer already. A gorgeous looking head of about two fingers in height rose up off the top and stayed FOREVER. I actually had to walk in the other room and take care of my son for about ten minutes and came back and it was still there, I was amazed! Thick, and coating side glass lace then trickled down the side of it and really just thickened up the whole thing. This was amazing looking, probably the best I could have ever envisioned it looking.
Smell - The aroma was very nice and tart. Huge aromas of Brett coming off of this immediately, turning the whole experience over to the funk that was in the glass, very nice to see. This was a little bit more sweet on the nose though then some of the other sours I have had, and after a few minutes, the cherries were very much detectable, with a dark sweetness about it. Very bright aroma, that really stuck out at you and welcomed you in. Some light woody aromas as well now as it gets a little warmer, this was turning out to be very nice indeed.
Taste - Ok, so here we go again. The first thing I notice, naturally would be the fully funked out Brett flavor coming through, though I have to admit it seems a little tamer then the Beatification I had last night. Still damn good in its own right though, but some of that deep, resonant sour taste, seems to be a little more tame that what I was expecting, A good bit of sweetness in here, balancing this one out a bit more. Nice notes of cherries riddled throughout this one. Very nice. After the initial wave of Brett, some soothing cherry sweetness rolls in behind it, with some nice tones of wood raveled in throughout as well. Really well blended, the aging is really coming into play here now. Very dry finish with the long lingering taste of sour Brett that as time fades, it does as well, but the zap of cherry sweetness lingered on long past everything else.
Mouthfeel - There was a very nice feel to this one. It came off a little bit fuller then some of the other sours I have had, with more of a rich feel, and loads of carbonation. Never a dull moment here, with a smooth texture, but yet still a crisp finish to it adding a bit of a refreshing touch to it.
Drinkability - This was superbly drinkable. The alcohol was never a factor, and with soo much yeast, I doubt you would ever be able to find it. Nice subtleness with the cherries was just enough to balance this so that you could have easily more then one. I was looking for another right away!
Overall I thought this was wonderful and well worth the price and the hassle to get it. These RR sours are unlike anything else made. It was truly unreal to see these develop and I am glad I have a few to lay down for a while. You really need to go out and get this one if you can find it, it is definitely worth it! 3,541 charactersmikesgroove, May 03, 2008
4.18/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Didn't really pay attention to the batch number...but it's the most recent one..just got delivered from RR last Thursday.
A: Nice hazy reddish orange, fairly interesting color. It almost makes me think of tomato juice (if it were less pulpy). Fluffy head, about a one-finger retention.
S: Strong sour smell-I note sour cherries and the typical citric acid smell of brett beers.
T: Lemony citric acid flavor dominates at first, which I've found is pretty typical for the style. Still, even at first this is more subdued than some of the other sour beers I've had. Once I got used to this, the cherry really came out, along with a funky/woodsy taste. This just got better and better as I drank it with the nuances really coming out by the end of the glass.
MF: Pretty mellow carbonation, a good thing since this doesn't really need any more bite. Not quite mouth-puckering, but it gets the salivary glands working. Syrupy, full, and extremely dry finish. Alcohol is noticable, and by the end it had hit me a bit, but it's not that strong. 
O: Best sour beer I've had to date (not that I've had a ton). Very drinkable once you get over the initial shock. I don't know if this will ever be a style that I just love, but this was surely worth the money. If this were more readily available, it would be something I'd try to keep on hand for when the mood struck me. 1,365 charactersrxdrewthejew, May 03, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 003 bottle, poured into a fluted tulip glass. 
Coloration is a burnished orange, leaning into very light shades of brown. Fizzy, wild foam on the first pour that settles down eventually, but rekindles with a swirl. 
Alternating aromas of wood and wet stone, then wild yeast spiciness, with the occasional cherry note. 
Huge sour cherry and oak, great puckering feel. Lingering spice, cherry pits, flesh, and skins. Aftertaste lingers forever, which reminds you to savor and take your time. Sourness is strong, near traditional Lambic levels. Utterly quenching and satisfying, salivary glands work overtime. Basically Supplication has all the best elements of Flanders ales, turned up to eleven.
It reminds me of Oerbier Reserva, in the level of sourness, wood, and tart berry flavors. They are both aged in wine barrels, possibly a key connection.
Thanks to Weibull & drseamus, who traded me one of these last year. 926 charactersemerge077, May 03, 2008

S- Smells tart, cherries, sour funk. Theres a bit of an off smell here that is sort of sulfury. I like sour but the rogue smell really throws me.
T- Tastes sweet with light fruits that move into cherries. After that of course comes the sourness. None of the strange smell from the nose, incredibly well balanced.
M- A bit thicker than russian rivers other wild ales with quite a bit of carbonation.
D- This is another winner from RR. Well balanced, delicious, what more is there to say. Maybe not my favorite of the sours but it is certainly worth a try (or two). 630 charactersLothore, Apr 19, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Picked up a bottle today from South Bay Drugs and Liquor.
Batch 003.
Big pop! Lots of pressure but thankfully not a gusher. Pours a caramel color with some red overtones when held to the light. A frothy white head builds up to about two inches and settles to half within the minute. There are some lacing on the sides of the glass every time I take a sip.
Smell is great. Tart cherries with some wood, funk, sour apples, and pears. The malt is hiding in the background behind the fruitiness, tartness, and funk. Some toasted bread aromas begin to come through as it warms up.
Taste is of a lovely sour and slightly aggressive carbonation on the back of the tongue. It leaves a bit of a salty sensation on the palate and you can feel the acidity travel down to your stomach. It has a big apple taste upfront too and mixes well with the sour cherries. Some vinegar flavors near the finish and lots of sour lemons too. Lots of oak flavors and right now it seems to be suppressing the cherries. Would have scored higher on the taste if I could taste some more cherries.
Mouth-feel is aggressive and punishing with the sourness and carbonation. The fruit seems to come near the finish and in the after-taste. Not as aggressive on the tongue once it warms up but still quite sour.
I need to get some more of this stuff. 1,319 charactersseaoflament, Apr 15, 2008

A: Cloudy, murky red/brown with a small white ring of bubbles.
S: Acidic, sour and fruity. Some cherry aroma on there, and a healthy portion of "biotics"
T: Sharp sour kick with some real sweet, cherry fruit and malt in the background. It's probably the least sour of the RR barrel aged beers, but it's still got a kick.
M: lively and silky and dry.
D: Very drinkable for the style. I could have a few before needing something sweet or some food. 479 charactersTheEremite, Apr 14, 2008
3.97/5  rDev -11.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375ml bottle
Hazy, orange/brown fluid. Modest, light tan head. Some sediment. Relatively still. Some legs, minimal lacing.
Scent is of cherries, and comes across as very tart. Complemented by citrus and acidic notes.
Taste is sour, but not dominatingly so. Reminds me of vitamin C tablets. Cherries snuck in there. Overall, very much like a dry, white wine. Touch of sweetness as I worked through it, grapes? Maybe the Pinot Noir barrel influence?
Medium body, at best. Carbonation is medium. Fairly dry.
I enjoyed this sour beer. Not my favorite style, but very tasty. An excellent change up from the hop trip I've been on. As a warning, stay away if you don't like tart flavors. 685 characters, Apr 14, 2008

Pours a rosey amber color with no head. More pleasant nose than most any of the other sours I sampled on the same evening. Nose of sourness, like funk and some dark fruitines. Taste is very tart, mild sweetness, and some fruitiness. Very oaky flavor and some dry, sour cherries as well. Quite tart indeed, yet still pretty drinkable. I can see this being really good, if Sours were my thing. 419 charactersJDV, Apr 06, 2008

S: Very simple, sour cherries and yeast.
T: Over powering sour cherries that needs sugar to calm the sour down. The flavors actually climbed up inside my nose and would not leave for quite some time.
M/D: Sour and hard to drink because of the lock jaw that ensued. I appreciate what the brewer was trying to do and that was create an amazingly sour beer for those who love sour like my wife but this intensity was a little to much for me. I will be having it again since my wife loves this one. 600 charactersKemmerlin, Mar 25, 2008

Reddish amber color with decent spotty head for the style.
Intense Sweet Tart aroma. Sour candy. Generic fruit.
Really extreme tartness, not as sweet as the nose. Generic sweet & sour fruity candy flavors ala Spree or Sweet Tarts, maybe cherry stands out a bt.
Nice and refreshing. Great example of RR wild ale. 349 charactersBeerZack, Mar 05, 2008

A- Poured from a 325ml bottle noted Batch #002 into a snifter. Pours a reddish-brown with no head just some small bubbles piled up on the side of the glass. This is a very hazy beer also.
S- Definite funk/sour in the nose. Not over-powering but very nice to me. I get cherries, melon, and apple. You know for sure you are in for a sour and tangy treat.
T- Apples at first followed by a sour cherry flavor. There is a pedio/lacto sourness throughout. This sour stays in your mouth and amplifies the other flavors. I don't taste an over strong acetobactor flavor in this. Vinnie has really kept the good bugs in and the bad ones out.
M- Incredible. Great natural carbonation with a very creamy mouthfeel. This really sticks around in your mouth but not to the point of being overly sweet or sour. 
D- I could drink this all night. I really like this beer. If I was to be perfectly honest, I didn't like cherry flavor only a few months ago. I have really begun to enjoy cherry flavor in beer. This is an incredible beer. I wish I had a case! 1,092 charactersMudpuppet, Mar 02, 2008

Pours a hazy copper with pink hues with fizzy beige head, little retention and spotty lacing. Smells of sour cherry, citrus zest, caramel, bread, yeast, and red wine. Taste is very tart with lots of sour cherry presence. Beyond that there is a taste of grapes, caramel, oak, brown sugar, and a musty funk. Medium-light in body with good carbonation and lots of tartness and an acidic balance. With a good amount of tart and sour flavors it isn't a beer for everyone, but it is certainly different and at least worth a try. A very unique brew that I wish I had more bottles of. Certainly not sessionable, but nice for a change every so often, especially for dessert. 792 charactersHopDerek, Feb 28, 2008

Deep, burnt reddish orange with a light haze and short-lived foam. The colour was really gorgeous! The aroma was very earthy and woody, juicy cherry, delicate red grapes, a bit vinous, fruity, with tart berry. Mouthwatering tartness in the flavour with a very light acidic character, sour cherry and vinous, raspberry, woody and oaky. Perhaps a hint of funk. Medium to light bodied with a bit of residual sugar present - still some dryness though. Mild warmth in the finish. This stuff is super tasty! Highly drinkable and a great accompaniment to dinner. I'm glad I have another bottle, but I'd love to have more. 671 charactersDrJay, Jan 24, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 002; Sampled January 2008
A careful, persistent pour yields a fat-one-finger thick, dingy, tan colored head. The beer is a brilliantly clear, light cherry red color. Tart aromatics of acetic acid, lactic acid and moldy cheese are the first thing I notice in the nose. Quite fruity, but it is a sort of non-descript, perhaps berry-like, sweet fruitiness. The barrel character is present, but held well in check by the other aromatic components; touches of vanillin, a backdrop of spicy oak, some hints of butterscotch around the edges and a tannic character that is definitely noticed. The nose is quite funky, teetering on the edge of being off; over-ripe cheese, penicillin and buttery oak notes all contribute to this. Compared to a Lambic, this has quite a bit of acetic acid character to it, which is something I always enjoy if kept to a reasonable level.
Tart tasting, in fact very tart tasting; this is a nice mix of lactic and acetic notes. The lactic acid is the more prevalent not, but I am not sure that the lesser amount of acetic acid is not the most noticed part of the acidity. Flavors of tart cherries, tamarind and star fruit are all noticeable in this exceedingly dry beer. The body actually has a bit of heft to it though, which should be attributed to the barrel contribution and touches of residual malt character. Dry cherry notes, rich (though diluted) balsamic character, . A tannic, tongue coating note in the finish adds spicy almost piquant oak flavors that coat the tongue in a long finish. The barrel adds notes of buttery oak, spicy wood, some soft, creamy vanillin and probably even some berry flavors (assuming that the noticed berry flavors are coming from the Pinot Noir part of the barrel). As the beer warms it really starts to come into its own; the fruit & malt seem to balance the sour notes all that much more and make this even more enjoyable.
This is quite a bit more acetic in character than batch one. This is actually quite hard for a red / brown styled sour beer. An aggressive, but enjoyable, experience if you are into that sort of thing. I like that the oak character is much more integrated (though it still plays a significant role) than it was in batch one, but it still has a little ways to go before it hits that perfect balance between malt and funk / oak. This is still a fantastic beer, but I can't wait to see if Vinnie can dial this in a bit more over the next couple batches.
Batch 001; Sampled July 2005
4/4.5/5/4/5 total=4.6
Pours a hazy ruby red color when held up to the light, an amber color otherwise. The head is thin and tan in color. The aroma is dominated by a fresh oakiness, but, especially when I was pouring this, there is a nice acetic acid note to this that reminds me of a Rodenbach. The nose has notes of buttery oak, hints of cherries, balsamic, and a certain tannic woodiness. The aroma is quite well integrated with a great balance to it, though it does lean toward the acidity, which I am partial to.
The taste is fairly dry, much drier than the pasteurized Flemish beers, but still strikes a malty balance with a bit of caramel complexity to it. The finish is pleasingly acidic, with a leaning towards the acetic side of things. This beer is really well done, I am quite impressed, this is quite a bit farther along than the temptation. The finish has notes of a tannic woodiness, plus a long sour note that lingers along with the woodiness. This beer certainly reminds me of cherries, with a nice fruitiness to it. The more I drink it the more I become enamored of this beer, an authentic Flemish style sour beer that has not been pasteurized. This is quite a bit better, and much more balanced than New Belgium's La Folie. There is a wonderful interplay between the oak, maltiness, and acid character; this is superb and I can't wait to get more vintages of this. 3,858 charactersGueuzedude, Jan 12, 2008

A - Good orange / amber hued beer with a thin white head quickly dissipating
S - Good sourness here with a underlying depth. Not as snappy as some other wild ales
T - Very tasty brew. You can taste the depth that comes from the oak aging, and the slight cherrry tartness is very complimentary to the sourness of the Brett.
M - Crisp, tart mouth feel with good carbonation
D - Could drink this consistently, if it weren't made in CA and not the easiest to get around me. This may not be the best sour beer that I have had, but certainly highly drinkable an a great offering from RR 620 charactersBravoTwo, Dec 26, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 512 oz. blue bottle, batch 002, bought at ABC Liquor in Long Beach, CA, on December 10th, 2007,
A: Pours a murky brown, but with a thick, nice, white head that leaves good retention until the beer is drunk, nice lacing there as well, but not a 5. 
S: Complex - Brown ale malt, sour cherries - kind of a Warheads/Sour Patch kids smell, but not artificial, real cherries, also balsamic vinegar, tart apples, strawberry, horse blankets and funk, with a hint of gouda or cheddar cheese, red apple peel as well. Possibly the most fragrant, beautiful smelling beer I have ever had.
T: Just as complex as the smell. Tartness and sour cherries at first sip, then the grape skins come in. The pinot noir and barnyard character is there throughout, there is also a light taste of grass and wood, wet hay as well. Once the beer is in your mouth for a couple of seconds, there is this funky hit that is just to die for. Truly fantastic and a brewing work of art.
M: Smooth, acidic, and tart, but it just melts across the tongue at a perfect pH, sublime, definitely has a cidery character to it.
D: This is definitely one of the best beers that I have ever had. I had had it once before when it was first released in stores here in SoCal a few months ago and really liked it, but this time wow. It's so easy to drink, I could have drank it in like 20 minutes, but I milked it for a couple of hours while watching the Santa Clause because it's so damn good. An extraordinary beer, couldn't recommend it more, go buy it, it's worth the price, even if it is about a dollar an ounce. 1,570 charactersHalcyondays, Dec 13, 2007

Small, quickly disappating head. Thin lacing. Slightly cloudy. Smells of cherries, pungently. Some alcohol on the nose too. Taste is of tart cherries with an earthy sweetness below. Sour, puckeringly delicious malt. As it warms, the cherries soften, or at least become less tart, and some oak and more sour malt come through wonderfully. The finish has some hints of vanilla, which add more depth to the overall flavor. Medium bodied and somewhat sticky. A nice-drinking wild ale that demands to be savored. So many subtle flavors and odors make every sip a treat. A wonderous beer creation. 681 charactersaforbes10, Nov 28, 2007

Smells of huge sourness, a little cherry and oak as an afterthought. Taste starts out mild then BAM, huge rush of tarty goodness. You want to pucker its so sour. Finally mellows out with the oak and cherry peaking through. Medium in the mouth and a tickle of either carbonation or the tartness giving its finishing move. You want to sip this because larger samplings at a time would be a waste. A very tasty and different libation. 506 charactersfranksnbeans, Nov 17, 2007
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Finally got around to drinking this... what an amazing beer.
Poured into a tulip glass, and that was the last time the beer would even mildly disappoint. A hazy light amber/brown (burnt sienna, we'll say) with a thin, waif-y head that disappears quickly. It looks fine, but if I wasn't sneaking glances back over at the bottle I wouldn't know quite what a treat I was in for.
The aroma is stunning. Sharp cherry tartness and other ripe fruit on a malty backbone with a distinct funk.
And it tastes even better... I was splitting this bottle with my girlfriend (damn my generous ways!) and it was all I could do not to gulp this down. Clean, crisp, refreshing! The funky sourness gives an awesome bite that never completely overpowers (this doesn't reach that "other" level of sourness achieved by, say, a nice geuze), and the cherry notes are carried high with the proper amount of sweetness, which isn't cloying or simple, but complex and full bodied, coats the tongue and lifts with an excellent level of carbonation. Oak-y astringency is just around the edges, rounding it off nicely. I couldn't be more pleased, particularly after Temptation set the bar so high. If I could afford to purchase by the case, I would. 
Excessively drinkable, complex enough to handle a variety of duties in food pairing, you simply must try this beer. And Russian River simply must find a way to produce more of it. 1,403 characterserrantnight, Nov 13, 2007

The beer finally pours a cloudy ochre color with minimal beige head. Aroma is funky, musty, and some oak and tart cherry as well. First sip reveals a light body with almost no carbonation. The texture is a little thin to watery. Flavor is as expected with caramel and tart cherry, some wooden notes and a fairly dry earthy and vinous finish. Not a bad beer after the initial gusher, but not my favorite sour brew either. 553 characterssulldaddy, Oct 29, 2007

sour cherries, tart cider, and citrus rinds in the aroma. some sugary malt sweetness as well; nice mix of aromas. a few off-putting metallic notes detract slightly.
starts with a gentle cidery sweetness, then progresses to a tartly abrasive and sharply carbonated finish. leaves flavors of woody cherries, sour citrus, tart grape skins, and a slight acidity. a nicely complex, tartly refreshing, very drinkable beer. 634 charactersPrufrock, Oct 28, 2007

Served at cellar temperature in an Ommegang chalice. Poured a beautiful reddish orange with brownish highlights, that was quite hazy. About a finger of loose, bubbly tan head sat atop the brew. Had faded pretty quickly and left little lace. Smell is of sour cherries, red wine, and some pretty wild yeast/bacteria aromas. Had a nice yeasty, sour cherry, red wine flavor that was quite tart. Also wood and bacteria like flavors. A nice crisp but very sour finish. Nice medium bodied acidic mouthfeel. Great drinkability and very enjoyable.

4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had a chance to try this at the Stone sour fest. The first Russian River beer I had on tap, and it didn't disappoint. Pours a deep orange that leans towards amber, big white foam head. 
After sampling it again in April '08, my thoughts have changed a bit. The sour/vinegar funk is still there in aroma and flavor, but in this vintage (unlike Temptation and Beatification) it's decidedly offset by a stronger citrus and fruit flavors -- particularly tart cherries.
Temptation is looking like my favorite of the three barrel aged Russian River offerings, but this is another great brew. 586 charactersOverlord, Sep 21, 2007
4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Wow, big thanks goes out to jamduggan for this treat.
375 mL cork/caged bottle poured into a tulip. Batch 002.
Pours a very unique, thick, murky, amber-brownish hue with a thin one finger light khaki colored head that seems to die down to a thin layer that stays for a good while. Stickiness isn't there at all. Smell is sour cherries, nuts, red wine, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is sour/acidic (but enjoyable) cherries, sounds pathetic but reminds me of a sour patch kid. Sweet and sour go back and forth fight each other on the tongue and in the end the sour seems to win the battle. Do I need to mention the Brett's? Well, I did...even though with any RR Wild Ale it's already a given. Beginning; sour. Middle; red wine. End; green apple. Such a complex brew, I'm sure I missed a crapload of flavors but these are the ones that stuck out to me. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a whole lotta carbonation. Crisp and bitter. Drinkability is pretty damn good. I took my time with it not because it was difficult to put down, but just because I wanted to get every flavor out of it I could. I look forward to the bottle of Sanctification I brought back from the brewery this summer. Russian River raises the bar with Supplication. Definitely enjoyed this one more than Temptation. 1,280 charactersBeerTruth, Sep 07, 2007
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 412.7 ounce corked bottle from Stuffed Sandwich in San Gabriel
Batch #2, bottled in January 2007 after being aged for 15 months
Worth the twelve dollars I spent on it, a dollar an ounce seems like a lot, but not for a beer as good as this one
I am not usually a fan of sour ales but this one is a league of its own
Poured with a mixture in color between brown and red with pretty much no head
Nice tart with a very evident cherry taste, very sour at first with a sweet fruity aftertaste
Have never smelled a better beer
Took my time drinking this one even though it would have been very easy to drink quickly
This aged beer lived up to all the hype and then some, too bad this has only been brewed 2 times ever, probably will not get to have this again any time soon
Further proves why Russian River Brewing Company is the best of the best 847 charactersFloydster, Sep 04, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Batch #001 w/ four hourglasses. 375 ml bottle purchased probably around two years ago, for around $8.99.
Appearance: A deep orange and ruby color with some haze, though the bottle was careful not to be disturbed. I expected a bigger head, but perhaps it was too cold, though I only chilled it in the fridge for a bit. Still it's pretty striking to look at it, and a swirl or two recharges it nicely.
Smell: Pinot ripeness with hints of raspberry, dark strawberry, tinges of vanilla and oak, candy sourness, and with swirls in between the earthy and more discordant nature comes out, balanced with the ripe fruit aromas. Also some orange and lemon zest with the sourness, and the bacterial and funky nature is wonderfully bizarre and intriguing. So much to love about the aroma, and more complexity to be discovered as it warms. 
Taste: Sour candy and tart fruit initially with bursts of earthy bacterial and phenolic funk to spice things up. Just enough sweetness to balance out the dryness, making this feel more like a Saison than any other RR brew I've had. As it warms, the initial bone dryness (and almost vinegar in nature, though more complimentary than discordant) gets a bit sweeter as it warms, or if not sweeter, then more balanced, with layers of flavor changing each second. Finish is dry and extremely long, with so many flavors coming out with the oak, funk, vanilla, fruit, tartness and fruity sourness, and just the effervescence of all of it combined. Wonderfully insane and beautiful overall. 
Mouthfeel: Wonderfully crisp and dry with a mouth puckering finish at the end. Can't really find any faults with this at all, as the carbonation with the medium body meld pretty much perfectly, especially with the sour and Saison-like nature of the brew. 
Drinkability: This is hard to find in the Richmond area, and a few years ago I got, I think, the last two bottle that Once Upon A Vine had. I still have another one that I'm planning to save for something special, but this one was opened because it's been way too long without trying it. Certainly there are many characteristics related to a Saison, more so than Temptation even I think, but it's truly an experience, and I really hope more folks start to experiment with the style in the future. Worth the $9 in my opinion, but obviously not something you could probably get often (especially since the bottle's slightly over 12 ounces). But still, bravo, this is amazing stuff, and I hope the distribution increases throughout the US as the years go on. 2,539 charactersasabreed, Aug 21, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch #002. Poured in a tulip at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia. 
Burnt redish brown color with a thin yet creamy head. Perfect clarity.
Rose, lemon, cherry,yeast, acetic, floral perfume and sour grape in the nose. 
Lots of vinous character in the start. Sour cherries, lemon, toasted almond, and slight yeasty earthiness. This is intensely sour and bone dry- in the best way. Tastes so good. Amazing.
Crisp yet smooth mouthfeel coupled with the refreshing sourness make this beer highly drinkable. Probably my favorite RR sour ale, maybe even my favorite sour ale. If you can find this, consider yourself lucky, and do the right thing and buy it. I spent 18 dollars on the 375 mL bottle and feel that it was well worth it. Highly recommended. 752 charactersbosco7, Aug 18, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a goblet. Orangish amber color, off-white head. Carbonation is champagney, effervescent and lively.
Smells beautifully sour. Oak and cherries come out in the background but overall this smells very acidic and tart.
Sweet red fruit fights for its life but the tartness takes over. Notes of cherry, wood, wine grapes, vanilla, brett. Bone dry finish. Great complexity here and a great combination of flavors.
Delicate body, carbonation like champagne, very smooth and bubbly. Clearly a beer to sip but it's very rewarding as it evolves with warmth. 561 charactersillidurit, Aug 14, 2007

Pours a turbulent orange-red with uncanny carbonation and head. It takes a long time to descend but eventually rests as a healthy and easily excitable skim.
Aroma is heavy on cherry vinegar, or what I imagine cherry vinegar would smell like if such a thing exists. Oak and wet animal hide really dominate but light notes of papaya and other tropical fruits do shine through from time to time. 
Body is very acidic, quite tart and somewhat sour. Tart cherries with a heavy wood presence dominate. Very bready or cakey with a lot of sour fruit yeast flavor. 
Delicious, depthful, and drinkable by the case. 748 charactersDaPeculierDane, Aug 02, 2007

Poured a dark red/light brown murky color. The smell was very yeasty which was expected because of the appearance. The taste was great. Sour and yeasty with a little carbonation. This was a nice wild ale and was enjoyed over an hour to experience different temps. Another good barrel aged product from Russian River. 416 charactersmymrnngjckt, Jul 26, 2007

The bottle was quite the bubbler when the cork came off.
Smell is the first thing to hit you. It is a strong heavy aroma.
Sour grape skins mixed with orange / lemon peel and sour tarts candy. Very sweet/sour mixture going into the nose.
The taste is dried cherries and lemon zest with a strange sweetness behind the spoonfull of tang first flavor. 
Aftertaste is of dried sour fruit with a candy sweetness finish.
Mouthfeel is very clean and this has all the pucker power you could want.
Drinkability is good here except for not being able to acquire more than one bottle at a time. Ky/California delima. 672 characterspeabody, Jul 20, 2007

Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2" light beige head over the reddish amber brew. Head fades gradullay, with plentiful slow-falling lace. Aroma is bubblegum upfront, with a strong tartness coming in after. Taste is cherries, sweet and then tart. Not noticing the barrel flavors as much as in Batch 001, seems a bit more lambic-leaning. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very nice. Tartness quenches the thirst as a bonus. Not quite as impressive for me as it's predecessor. 601 charactersppoitras, Jul 12, 2007

S: Could probably smell this a block away. fruit, tart cherries mixed with light oak.
T: tart fruit, vinous.
M: Cidery. Light and prickly on the tongue. Pretty acidic.
Enjoyed this very much. Had a nice rich taste within a relatively light alcohol body. Acidity is its limiting quality, as it somewhat burns on its way down. Otherwise the sour and fruit work very nicely together. 528 charactersMiScusi, Jul 09, 2007

A: Pours a brilliant orange color. Lots of foam after I popped the cork on this one. It overflowed a bit but nothing too bad. Virtually no head at all.
S: Lots of tart fruit aromas in the smell. There is also some funky earthy aromas in there as well.
T: A fascinating beer, probably the most unique one that I've had yet. Starts with some fruity sweetness; cherries, apricots, and lemon. The tartness then shines through in a big way. Lots of complexity in this thing coming from the oak flavors as well as the funky and musty yeast flavors. Very wine like with big bursts of flavors. 
M: A totally unique mouthfeel. It's slightly syrupy with very light carbonation. 
D: It's definitely a sipper. Would pair very will with food. Not something I'll be having very often but highly recommended in order to demonstrate the wonderful range of beer and the incredible things that are being done by American craft brewers. 1,017 characterswilljschmidt, Jul 07, 2007

Pours a very cloudy reddish brown, nice tinge to it, thick off white, little reddish head forms, quickly settles down to a thin layer, thick ring around the glass, few lace spots. Smell is very acidic, lots of cherry, very oaky, toffee, sweet and malty once you get used to the acidity, excellent. Taste is very powerful, very malty, lots of sweet cherry, oak, toffee, touch of vanilla, sour cherry and funk, moves into a kind of minty citrus, more oak, malty dates, wow. Insanely complex, nice acidic finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, really coating, silky carbonation. Excellent beer, not as insane as Temptation but a broader range of flavours and I think a little more complex. Thanks Scott! 767 charactersViggo, Jul 02, 2007

Appearance: Batch 1 pours a hazy mahogany color with a moderate head that declines to a ringlet and leaves the occasional shard of lace (the less mature Batch 3 has a much bigger head but the rest of the commentary is accurate)
Smell: Sour cherry, vinous pinot, oak barrel and some barnyard funk
Taste: Starts with a characteristic Flanders Red flavor profile with slightly toasted malts that build in tart cherry and chocolate directions by mid-palate; after the swallow, the sourness really builds and joins with the oaky character to provide a balanced finish
Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate, creamy carbonation
Drinkability: Batch 1 has been aging in my cellar for two years and has truly benefited from the age; an extraordinary accomplishment; (Batch 3 is a bit raw so if you have patience, wait a couple of years) 888 charactersbrentk56, Jun 25, 2007
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This bottle is from batch 002.
Appearance: Deep, dark transparent red with a small blanket of foam that fades into a ring pretty quickly.
Aroma: Lactic sourness with a hint of sweetness. Unripened cherries and slight funk. The wine barrel becomes more noticeable as it warms. Outstanding.
Taste: Cherries and raspberries, oaky tannins, just a touch of sweetness. The dry finish really brings out the wine barrel flavors.
Mouthfeel: Moderate acidity. Medium-to-light bodied, but the tart quality of the ale gives it a refreshing quality. Gentle carbonation.
Drinkability: Normally such an acidic beer would keep the drinkability fairly low for me, but this is so good that I honestly don't mind it. 702 characterslargadeer, Jun 19, 2007

Bright reddish amber color. Quite clear on the first pour. Modest beige head.
Smells staggeringly good. Bright sour fruit blends seemlessly with brett funk and caramel. Cherry, raspberry, pineapple, apricot, horse, leather, deep bacterial damp earth. Hints of wood, vanilla, vinegar. Complex, cohesive, and wonderful.
Tastes fruity and bracingly tart, with delicate sweetness balancing very well with the acidity. Quickly dries out, with brett and some pleasant cherry stone bitterness picking up. Totally cohesive - like a horse eating cherries and raspberries in some brambly woods, the day after a rainstorm - and very enjoyable.
Prickly acidity and some woody cherry stone astringency make for a good mouthfeel.
Ridiculously drinkable, for the acid level. Very refreshing. This went too fast.
Really great stuff. 885 charactersBeerzebub, May 25, 2007

Chris at Ebenezer's Pub wanted me to try Supplication. (By the way, if you're ever in central western Maine, Ebenezer's in Lovell is a destination). This was a 375ml champagne bottle, Batch 002, poured into a tulip glass. Nice red color with very little head. It had a cherry aroma. The taste was primarily sour cherry, very tart and almost astringent. It was vaguely vinous. A little bit of yeast showed up late. Very good mouthfeel. The drinkability, to me, is limited by the tartness. 564 characterslordofthewiens, May 16, 2007

Pours a beautiful, unfiltered, hazy reddish orange into a white wine glass. One finger of bubbly, short-lived white head. One hell of a lot of carbonation. Faint traces of oil float on top. 
Smells like sour cherries, and another tart, almost raspberry-like aroma, along with a faint note of acetic acid. 
Tastes just the way it smells. Mouth-puckering tartness, just the way it should be. Sweet cherry notes help to make this beer so much more drinkable. What I really like about this beer is that it has the tartness of a good infected beer, but it is not as much of an uphill battle to drink as some I have had. A great example of what this style can be. 
Lively, bubbly, creamy mouthfeel. Now if noly my teeth didn't hurt from all the acidity...
As far as this style goes, this is the most drinkable I have yet encountered. I knocked back the whole bottle alone without any difficulty. 
Truly a remarkable achievement. 1,045 charactersBoppar, May 16, 2007

S- Big sour nose with some red wine in there too. Cherries and grapes come out along with some oak. The sour is pretty strong up front.
T- Sour cherries up front followed by a really dry grape flavor which then blends into the red wine characteristics which warms chest nicley, especially for only 7.00%. It leaves mouth very dry with a light bitterness and warmth to it. Oak flavors come in and out and stay along for the aftertaste too.
M- Medium/thin body with a high/medium champagne carbonation feel to it.

Awful nice pour. Incarnadine, light specks of yeast floating upward against a cascade of champagne bubbles. Bigass, sticky white head.
Smells of very sweet malt--almost a little rye, if that doesn't seem too odd--along with chewy french bread and fresh, tart black cherries. Smells like candies, pie, and beer.
Tastes amazing! Belgiany yeast, europsice, and cherry juice dance all around each other all throughout as it the beer starts tart, moves into a dryer, sweeter middle, and ends on a kick of candy sour. The flavors blend so well! It's like some sort of candy syrup only it's not so sickeningly sweet as most candies.
Absolutely fantastic. Blows away any other sour beer I've had. Amazing. The first beer I've had from Russian River and already I am absolutely in love with this brewery. 818 charactersmynie, May 11, 2007

And also to metallitone1; Thanks Tim so much for hookin me up with one of these. I shared the second bottle with phnphilly and bookert last night and I am in love with this beer, WOW!
Appearance: Pours a gorgeous ruddy copper color with a foamy head that fades fast leaving a little lacing in the glass.
Smell: Rich sour apple aroma with musty woody funk and lactic notes just absolutely flood the nose. There is a distinct sweetness that suggests fruits but it does not detract from the bold sour cherry and Brett that comes close to as funky as a Lambic but narrowly skirts that level of intensity. 
Taste: Here the nose skirts the sour side and mellows a bit with sweetness the flavor in the mouth slides over a bit more to the delicious dark side. It does start out with a element of sweet fruit but quickly the lactic notes and wild funk along with a touch of acidity move in on the palate. The wood flavors are strong and seep deep into the cheeks. Tart cherry is evident in the musty funkiness that takes over the entire palate. The best feature is the amazingly long lingering after taste! EXCEPTIONAL!
Mouthfeel: The acidity is the mouth is very solid but not overwhelming. The finish does force a pucker and leave a long lingering aftertaste on the cheeks long after the beer is gone. After the sourness fades there is a residual sweetness that seem to seep back out onto the cheeks.
Drinkability: I LOVE SOUR BEER! This is a beer I could dink forever. Thank you thank you thank you Jason for sharing it with me!
Hope this is helpful.

Poured well-chilled into a Russian River Barrel Aged Ales stemmed glass, Supplication is a striking ruby and amber color -- like the blood orange Italian soda my partner brought home the other day -- hazy with a thin but persistent pinkish-grey head. Sour citric aromas (lime, kumquat, orange zest) mingle with a sharp bretty funk, some rubbery phenolic business, and a dusty attic floor scent. Mind-bogglingly complex, to say the least, and incredibly mouth-watering as well. Make that mouth-puckering. This is unbelievably sour, with an acidity that rivals the strength of Cantillon gueuze but retains a fruity zing that is entirely its own. There are slight cherry notes, along with an unripened raspberry twinge. The cherry flavor rapidly emerges to the fore with every degree warmer this beer gets. Mellow wood grain inflections. Tannic grapeskin in the aftertaste. Juicy mouthfeel up front due to the fruit flavors, but extremely dessicating from mid-sip onward to the cottonmouth-inducing finish. An amazing creation overall, and an exceptional beer with which to celebrate the arrival of warmer weather. 1,122 charactersorfeu, Apr 19, 2007

All that funk and it still started sweetish, and then finished with a sour sweet-tart. Also seemed fairly thin bodied, no coatings to speak of.

Dark orange, fizzy beige head forms after the volcanic explosion upon releasing the cork. Bold cherry sourness..woody flavors are definitely noticeable and both come together quite well.

Been really close to 10 years since last I've had this brew.
Poured into a tulip a very nice cloudy amberish color, pretty nice carbonation, with a pretty nice quick/fizzy off-white head, which leaves a really nice island and some sticky lacing behind.

Thanks goes out to Bitterbill for this brew.

Wow, what a beer, I'm a fan of the Jolly Pumpkin's and this was a natural for me. Great tart, friuty aroma that was present in the taste also. On top of this there was slight oak and malt flavors, amoungst a bunch of others that I couldn't even idenify, but did taste them there. The mouthfeel was standard for a beer of this type, and the tartness was not over powering by any standards.

Appearance: Solid pop as the cork is pulled, pours a reddish brown with a bit of haze, medium head that fades very slowly, leaving quite a bit of lacing. Great head retention.
Smell: Sour and fruity. Tartness definitely dominates, underneath is just a bit of malt sweetness.
Taste: At a bit of a loss here - unfortunately I don't have the opportunity to taste enough wild beers to be able to identify all the subtleties of flavor present here. Starts off a bit puckering - very sour. Then some malt flavors come in - just a bit bready, finishes super dry. Lots of acetic acid flavor, but not in a bad way at all. A bit of farmhouse funk to it as well - like a stinky cheese.
Overall impression: As with most Russian River beers, I'm impressed. Huge depth of flavor - although it cost me a fair amount to get it to Colorado, it was more than worth it. Why aren't more American brewers experimenting with the wild styles? 1,076 charactersrowew, Mar 28, 2007
4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5375mL mini-magnum with a simple blue label marked "batch 001" and "barrel-aged one year." I'm giving extra appearance points for the coolness of this bottle, which is enough to legitimately add to the drinking experience.
Pours cloudy gold with fine, brisk carbonation and a half finger head and quite a bit of lacing. Aside from the cloudiness and the head, this beer is indistinguishable from a fine champagne.
The nose is impossibly complex. A drop of acetic acid and just a shade of barnyardy Brett. Distinct winey and cidery notes are clearly present, along with some phenols. Absolutely no malt, hops, or anything to otherwise suggest that this is beer.
The flavor includes everything in the nose, but in different percentages and with a few surprises. The Brett is in the background now, with the brisk, refreshing sourness, winey flavors, berries, and sour cherries in the forefront. Finishes with a snap of fruity sourness. 
The palate is lively, with loads of fine carbonation and mouth-puckering sourness. 
How's this for drinkability? I could easily drink ten bottles a day, every day for the rest of my life.
This beer is a masterpiece. 1,167 characterskajerm, Mar 27, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Been sitting on this for a month or so. Nice to finally imbibe.
Appearance: Man, I'm a sucker for wild yeasts' ability to make a beer lively. You see, I enjoy a good lacing, and this has it in spades. That being said, the head, relative to the bottle of Temptation I had a few months ago, is barely existent, so it loses some points for that. Lacing is just amazing, that being said. Sticky, spotted, arm-like, all the patterns I seem to see in other beers wrapped into one. The body is also a very pretty approximation of caramel. Cool.
Smell: Jesus. Candy sugar, wine grapes, oak, a definite black licorice, cherries, plums, raisins, cranberries, apple, burnt sugar (caramel), brett, nutmeg, cinnamon, yeasty dough, sandalwood, rosemary, I just could go on and on. Tremendously complex. Absolutely phenomenal. I am again, as I suspected I'd be, floored by RR's wild ale.
Taste: Tart cherries on the front end, sea salt, brett, pinot noir grapes, oak on the back, rosemary, plums. Again, like Temptation, I find mouth less adequate at picking out the individual flavors than my nose. Either that, or I find the nose to be better than the mouth, but only by a hair. The taste is massively complex, still, just, in this one, the tartness of the cherry flavor can be a bit overpowering. Still, bloody awesome.
Mouthfeel: Fizzy, tart, astringent, syrupy, light and heavy at the same time. A wonderful variety.
Drinkability: This is a sipper, but really only for its flavor and nose complexity. The alcohol, if any, is barely apparent, and the flavors do not overwhelm you. The tartness of the cherries is perhaps the only overpowering characteristic, and really that only shows itself upon swallowing. 
An amazing ale. 1,733 charactersRidiculedDisplay, Mar 27, 2007
4.94/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Purchased at Stone Brewery Bistro. Man oh man, this was my first American Wild Ale, and it was a real beauty. After my first drink I already knew it was at least in top 10 favorite beers. I would even venture to say that it is my absolute favorite, right up there with De Ranke's Kriek. It smelled somewhat like a lambic, and it had a similar sourness to it, though I could certainly taste the aging in the Pinot Noir wine barrels...though the alcohol was only slightly present in the taste, it more so affected the mouthfeel adding a little warmth to it. Overall, it was a very distinct experience from tasting a lambic and I highly recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to crack open the one I have waiting at home in California as well as the RR Temptation in there as well. This indeed is the future of beer! 811 charactersEmilNoldSinclair, Mar 26, 2007

A - Murky reddish brown. Small off white head that settled out really quick.
S - Sour cherry, hints of raspberry, oak and horse blanket.
T - Similar to the aroma but so much more captivating and complex. Sou, but not harsh, swirling malts but nothing singularly identifiable. Brett influenced but not dominated. Wow.

The beer is dark amber in color with little yeasties floating in suspension. Floating yeast is to be expected from a bottle conditioned beer. The head fell quickly, although I did leave the bottle for a bit after it ran over. The aroma has a strong brett presence with a cidery aroma in there as well. The tart cherry taste, brett, and carbonation make the glands in my neck tingle. The brett is very pronounced and seems to make the body seem lighter and thinner. Overall, the only disappointment is the lack of body. 613 charactersdrseamus, Mar 16, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served initially at under cellar temp into my wonderful Delirium Tremens glass, but consumed over the course of an hour. 
A: Beautiful medium red color with a hint of brown topped off by a 1 finger off-white head that leaves just a bit of lacing.
S: Smell is mostly of tart cherries, but with a certain mellowness. Has some woody notes too. Upon warming, it has an almost musty (in a good way) port wine sort of note. Wonderful.
T: Initial taste is of tart cherries. Subsequently, there is some sweetness in the background - maybe some raspberry and woody flavors. As it warms more, the cherries retreat some to let the sweter malts come through. A raspberry-like sweetness is definitely there (and no, not in an artificial way at all). Oh man. This just keeps getting better! The cherry tartness now just peeks out ever so delicately at the end. I've never tasted such a delicate wild ale involving cherries before! Just a bit of earthy funkiness too. Think delicate raspberries with a dash of vanilla and cocoa, followed by a perfectly balanced cherry tartness. The taste of this beer is practically perfect. I don't award many 5s here, but this beer, this divine nectar, is definitely deserving.
M: Coats all of the mouth ever so well with flavor with a medium body and an almost smooth, rich finish. I say this while also acknowledging a quick, sharp bite at the end from the cherries.
D: One of the most drinkable wild ales of this sort. While I enjoy a Duchesse on occasion, this I consider far more drinkable. For the style, I have to give this a 5 for drinkability.
Highly recommended. Truly masterfully crafted. This is a beer you give to someone who says all beer tastes the same. One taste and they'll beg forgiveness for spouting off such crazy fallacies. 1,785 charactersrallison, Mar 13, 2007

Batch 002
Pours a hazy reddish-brown color with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Smell is very tart, there are aromas of cherries, but there isn't a whole lot to them, predominant smells of sour and funk. This is not as sour as some other beers of this style, but that's not the goal, the goal is to create a damn good brew and I would say mission accomplished. There are sour cherries in the taste as well, but it's more of a vinegar-like sourness mixed with some oak and some grapes. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and had medium levels of carbonation, finish was dry. Extremely drinkable, I would have plenty of this often if I were given the chance. 823 charactersbadbeer, Mar 12, 2007

Appearance: Reddish brown with a head strong enough to stick around the side of the glass throughout the whole imbibing period. There was no lacing, and no change to the appearnce through drinkage.
Smell: A little like a flemish red ale, and a little like cherries, this smells like it's going to taste out of this world. I would have liked a little more of the oak aging to come through, however.
Taste: Fresh cherries hit the palate, but are not very strong. There is also a vinegar taste and a malt depth that reminds me of some stronger belgian dark beers. Nothing in the taste is very intense, but everything blends to make this quite nice. I ate this along with jalapeno poppers and a raspberry dip, and they complimented each other very well.
Mouthfeel: So sour, one of the sourest beers I've ever had, if not the sourest. Amazing.
Drinkability: I want more, much more, this is now one of my favorite beers. I'm going to order a ton of batch 003 when they finally come out with it. Yum. 1,018 charactersdbalsock, Mar 12, 2007

Yeah. Pours a slight head that goes away right away. The color is brownish gold with a cloudyness. The smell is very Belgian with Brett yeast and some horse blanket, but the age has made it so it's not too offensive. The taste is sour with an lemon-like aftertaste mixed with the horse blanket sourness. It's definetly like my first sour beer where I made a sour face, this is mellowed and nice. The mouthfeel is good, a little heavy like water, but nothing negative to say about it. Overall it was nice to try, I would have this again sometime. 678 charactersErdinger2003, Mar 11, 2007

A - Pours a murky orange copper with no head. I used a delicate pour after the bottle overflowed when the cork was popped.
S - Sour cherries with oak. Sweet grapes with some musty funk and a vinegar lactic acid blend. It is sour complex and funky with a dose of cherry.
T - Sour cherries with some tannin from the wood followed by a punch of acidic & vinegar sourness that bites at the tongue. The acidity packs a punch. You are left with a grapey pinot noir taste dangling on your tastebuds.
M - Medium bodied with lively carbonation which plays up the acidity.
D - I am beginning to really love the combo of sour beers and cherries (thanks to the help from New Glarus) and Supplication is a great example of this combo. A fantastic beer. Wish I had ordered more. 900 charactersbrewcrew76, Mar 10, 2007
4.41/5  rDev -2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 002
This is one hell of a beer. Just the right amount of funk to it. I'm never quite sure what to expect with one of these Russian River wild ales, but they don't cease to disappoint.
The beer pours to a murky rusted brown color. Completely opaque. An effervescent brown head forms and falls no sooner then it builds. Subsequently no lacing to the glass, though it does show off a nice pair of legs similar to that of a nice fine wine.
The smell is nothing short of spectacular. Perhaps I am getting a bigger whiff than would be afforded by pouring straight into my goblet since about 3 ounces of the liquid is currently soaked into the carpet which my ass is currently parked next to, no thanks to a gushing bottle. Take care to open the bottle over the sink and have your glass ready so as not to waste a good portion of this precious liquid to the drain. Anyways, back to the smell. Wonderful tart cherry aromas. Also a good deal of oak tannin and a host of aromas thrown off by all the funky bacteria. Just a little bit of grainy must and candied sweetness. Easily among the most wonderful smells I've ever experienced from a beer.
The taste is also very good, but the cherry is not quite as pungent. The funky bacterial yeasts make sure of that, along with a stronger oak flavor. Candy sweetness up front, shortly followed by a nice sour cherry and funky tartness to the finish. Not nearly as tart as something such as Cantillon. More along the lines of a Gueuze Boon. The finish drops off abruptly, leaving only the taste of oak and cherry as a reminder. Actually has a decent amount of hops bitterness to it, considering the style.
The body is difficult to judge when my whole mouth is puckering under the onslaught of tartness, but I would judge that it is medium and fairly dry. The 9% ABV is very well hidden. Crisp carbonation as one would expect. Quite drinkable for a strong tart beer. Reminds me quite a bit of Gueuze Boon Marriage Parfait, though with more oakiness. 2,002 charactersneonbrown82, Mar 09, 2007

It's sour... sour... sour... SUPER sour! Very tart and crisp on the finish, there is also considerable bitterness noted as well.
Mouthfeel is great, carbonation is wonderful.
This is easily the most interesting beer I have ever tried. Highly recommended! It's a bit too funky to be an everyday drinking beer. This is so different... I just think I like Temptation just a little bit better. 593 charactersflexabull, Mar 04, 2007

Its a hazy red with a bit of foam. Smells of oak, leather, paint. Tastes tangy and a touch bitter with cherry and pinot flavors for the barrels. Drink this one cool as the fruit flavors come out more. The funky bacteria flavors tend to overtake this one as it warms. A heck of an interesting brew though. I'd take this over Rodenbach any day. Cheers to RR for making weird stuff like this. 447 characterstempest, Mar 01, 2007
4.69/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 002. Pours a brilliant and hazy amber. There is some light tan foam but it quickly fades leaving a nice ring. The smell is terrific. The moment you take out the cork the sour cherry permeates the air. Bright vinegary oak, with tart cherry flood the senses with hints of peppery, cinnamon spice in the background. The aroma is very much reminiscent of a Flanders Red. 
The sourness creeps in immediately in the first taste, and amazingly it gets even more intense after a moment. Notes of oak and cherry dominate with apple and pear subtleties in there also. The finish softens a bit, and there is a bit of a sulfur-like/lit match character. You would expect it to be very acidic or astringent but it is not at all. The sourness lingers just enough to make you cringe wanting more. As for the alcohol, you can't taste it. The carbonation is fine, tingly, and flourishing. It creates a fullness on the palate despite the light body.
This beer was exceptional. I could drink one of these every day, if only there was that much to go around. Get a bottle of this and drink it now... 1,090 charactersbennetj17, Feb 26, 2007

Beautiful beer!! Apple cider appearance from afar. Some of the yeast got into my tulip and is wonderously floating about. A small off white head, quarter inch fades in typical fashion. 
Sour cherry as well as hints of black cherry dominate the nose. Very earthy with mild leather, and licorice accents. Hints of cedar and rhubarb, as well as light raspberry and rose petal accents. The wild yeast make their impression felt and make you wonder what the hell is this gonna taste like. 
A complex mouthfull of feminine lust has take my glass captive. This beer is special and absolutely delicious. And unfortunately going to be gone soon. As expected sour cherry are first and foremost but there are some many multiple underlying flavors it's going to be hard to mention even half of what sensory ducts are being penetrated...strawberry and raspberry hide on the mid palate, with sassafrass and rhubarb notes. Hints of black truffle and the effervesence of earthy, cigar box flavors. Man this is great.
Medium with a slight prickly feeling. I could drink this beer daily and be content. 1,106 charactersmcallister, Feb 13, 2007

Sour cherries dominate the nose along with additional notes of sweet malt, leather, wet wood, and a barnyard / horse blanket funk. Quite sniffable actually. Taste is sweet lightly toasted malt and a bit of brown sugar delicately balanced by a tart cherry sourness along with a wild yeastiness and an earthy woodiness. Notes of oak and vanilla are detectable in the background. This was a real treat to drinkI only wish I had more than the one bottle. 559 charactersMorris729, Jan 26, 2007

Batch 001
A: Pours a very murky golden with a tiny bubbly head that subsides to a clingy ring of froth around the tulip. Lacing slowly slides down the glass.
S: Very aromatic with a prominent aroma of pinot noir, and one that would be easily recognised as such even if it were not on the label. Also, a subtle cherry aroma and a bit of funk.
T: Again, lots of pinot noir and cherry in the flavor. The brett provides a complexity that is unparalleled with anything that I've had. Finishes with a sort of menthol/minty taste. Oustanding.
M: Medium-full bodied with a chewy and sticky texture. Quite a bit of carbination from the bottle-conditioning, but it is very complementary.
D: This is ecstasy in a bottle. Go get some. Sell off your children if necessary. 820 charactersklewis, Jan 12, 2007

aroma is yeasty, deep cherry, berries, dried apricot aroma, combined with complex earthy, barnyard and brett aromas. very inviting. 
wow, great penetrating sour taste hits the tongue. didn't pick all that up in the aroma. super dry, with sour cherry, bitter lemon, sweet berry, cassis. tons of minerality and acidity. carbonated and zippy, but smooth like a fine champagne. finishes with a slightly bitter, funky barnyard note.
basically, an amazing beer. i wish i had a case of this stuff, and that this was a 750ml bottle. i don't know how long ive been hiding it in the cold (at least a year, maybe two), but it's perfectly balanced and wonderfully complex. perfect as an apparatif or with food.
combines the best complexity of a lambic with a friendly fruity flavor and a minerality reminiscent of great champagne.
near the end of the beer i swirled the tiny bit left in the bottle and poured the yeast in, creating a murky orange color. surprisingly, more of the cherry sweetness came out in both the aroma and taste. the beer became softer and creamier. this was not what i was expecting. good, but i prefer it without the yeast because of its racy, sour characteristics (even tho many beers i prefer adding the yeasties).
this was truly a perfect pairing with a thick cut pork chop with a sweet and sour pan sauce (sweet vermouth, smoked bacon, shallots, plum tomato, butter, etc.), some roasted yams and a salad. just amazing. 1,595 charactersstudentofbeer, Dec 14, 2006

Polished, glimmering bronzed amber. Short cap of tanned, loosely piled bubbles that dissipates to a skim coat. Initial glass-covering large bubbled carbonation gives way to a narrow pillar of fine bubbles. Vibrant aromas of brett, cherry pits and tart skin, some damp wood. Simultaneously sweet and just a touch sour and funky. The taste starts with a nice tart sharpness that is filled with a dry cherry-laced sweetness. The underlying brown ale is readily discernable and serves as a solid base. Some damp wood becomes evident during consumption. The brett character is long in the finish and is complimented by a bit of sourness in the tail end. As it warms, the sweetness comes up a touch. Medium body with barely detectable carbonation, the light sharpness reduces the body a bit. There is a light slickness that glazes the tongue. It was hard to put the glass down as the Supplication was absolutely enjoyable. Unfortunately it was my last bottle, but I am looking forward to the next release. 1,040 charactershopsaplenty, Nov 13, 2006

It pours a beautiful clear copper, brown orange, glowing with nice light and clarity. Good head with slight crisp burnt toffee lacing.
Could have a near perfect aroma: a great balance of sour cherry, alcohol, horse blanket, vanilla and baking pie crust. Nice.
The taste follows as near perfect: a big wallop of front sweet, sour cherry, vanilla, tart pie baking crust, full full funkiness, barnyard, tart apple, cranberry. Great finish dry and fruity tart.
Mouthfeel is great, excellent carbonation, with clean biting, semi-dry but still wet. Yes, I wanted more after my half glass was gone, still wanting more. 869 charactersNoLiberty, Oct 09, 2006

4.02/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Gorgeous onion skin with amber highlights. Creamy off-white extremely fine head peaks at a solid half inch and settles slowly to a complete cap that leaves nice lace.
Extraordinary nose of deep, fleshy sweet cherry intertwined with racy sour notes. As it warms, the brett aromas appear adding horse blanket, and dark spice. There's an earthy maltiness rumbling below it all. Just stunning.
The palate is a relatively big let down from the nose (but almost anything would be). Much simpler with the flavors that are so distinct on the nose becoming muddy. It's on the full side of medium, and the malt plays the predominant role in the mouth. The cherry moves to a bit role, and it's surprisingly no where near as sour as the nose promises. Medium length, with a touch of acid coming through with a whack of oak on the finish.
Lovely bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Really velvety and attractive. Smellability is off the scale, but drinkability not so much for me as the oak is a bit much, and the palate just isn't that interesting. Some additional cellar time might allow the sourness to build and break through the palate adding balance and interest. We'll see. Regardless, an inspiring effort and one hell of a nose.

A good flavor, but I didnt do a great job capturing it here in my review. It came late in a session. I recommend it.

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Yikes, where to begin; the cacophony of artistry that went into brewing this is mind numbing. Purchased this in California in February, and after going back there recently I was reminded, hey I didn't drink that Supplication yet! So here we are. An interesting creation indeed. Pours a deep, hazed orangey amber, with an initally thick head that dies to lace, though upon swirling to pick up the interesting aroma, it rebounds if only for a moment. 
Initially, the first thought upon getting a whiff of this brew is "lambic." Sour, musty funky cherry aroma, but there's also a very earthy rotted pumpkin thing going on here. Innnteresting. Flavors meld beautifully; upfront tartness yields to woody birch bark flavors, followed swiftly (as this is all too quaffable) by the lingering mildly sour cherry vanilla notes. Carbonation is noticeable on the palate, yet somehow has a creamy, lactic milk-like feel that I've never tasted. Usually it's one or the other; this is well carbonated and strangely creamy. What the? Can there be a creativity rating? This gets 5's there. Extremely unique, tasty, complex and worth seeking out. 1,131 charactersIrishRedRock, Jun 03, 2006

I was lucky enought to try Russian River's Supplication on Tap at Monk's in Philly and it was just phenomenal. It's hard to rate it according to style, being a wild ale. It certainly was wild. Like an american lambic but hoppier and less concerned with stylistic guidelines.
Hoppy, fruity, slightly piney.
Taste is just a unique experince. More like a lambic but with some bitterness and some strong alcohol kick.
Had with a venison pot pie. Excellent pairing.
Just find it and drink it! 578 charactersBillyB, Jun 03, 2006
4.79/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a Magnum bottle (thanks to Ray and Cornelia) this ale is a murky, dirty apricot color with a frothy off white head that leaves delicate patterns of lace.
The aroma is a mouthwatering melange of sweet/tart cherries, rotting pit fruit, vanilla and oak, light spice, and something that is just impossible to put into words. The wild yeast really works a strange kind of beer magic here.
The flavor first strikes you as tart, cidery, and lightly acidic. Warmpth brings out a sweet and sour fresh cherry note with hints of almond and pear. The layers of oak and vanilla add a not so subtle complexity that is heightened by the funky yeast that is both rustic and farmy. Definately has Flemish Red Ale qualities but is in a league all of it's own.
Body is very smooth and buttery, with a soft, creamy texture and amazing drinkability. Another superb product from a brewer that is quickly becoming one of my all-time favorites. 941 charactersAlexJ, May 27, 2006

4.03/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I poured the contents of a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. The head filled it to the rim, then settled to a dense 1/4" lacy layer. The color was a light orangy-copper color. I held the beer up to the light and saw a swirling cloudiness that made it seem like something significant was going on inside that glass. I was anxious to proceed.
I perceived the odor as a mixture of cherries and pine.
Upon entering my mouth, the first sensation I felt was tartness, extreme tartness to the point where could actually feel the glands in my neck swelling from the shock. I quickly identified the source of this tartness as a cherry flavor which gradually became sweeter and more soothing as my taste buds adjusted. Mixed with this was a flavor reminiscent of champagne.
It was very abrasive on the palate, acidic, somewhat vinegary, somewhat heavy on the carbonation.
Tart cherries? Acidic? Vinegary? Abrasive? Despite all of these seemingly deterrent qualities, I actually enjoyed this one. It went down more easily with each sip, and not just because the alcohol was taking effect. I liked that the cherry flavor was tart rather than sweet, as it tasted more genuine and better complemented the other intense flavors.
Supplication is unlike anything I've ever had; in a blind taste test, I'd wonder if this was, in fact, a beer, and not some other category of alcohol with which I'm not familiar. Maybe I'm just not that well versed in high quality brown ales, or maybe this one's just in a league of its own.
I decided not to read the bottle before trying this so as not to bias 
my senses, but now that I read the description--the year of aging, the winemaking background of the brewer, the similar process to champagne making--I understand why this beer tastes so unusual.
I'll definitely pick this one up again on occasion, and I'd like to try it with a heavy meal, perhaps some tri-tip and mashed potatoes. 1,928 charactersinstrumentality, May 20, 2006

Clarity is moderate, with a bit of haze and without apparent carbonation. Good looker. Nose is excellent, with moderate sourness, with a very solid backing of cherry. Its not biting, but very inviting. Almost a touch of acetone-like aromas that I associate with sour browns. Flavor is very nice, mildly sour, moving towards a very smooth cherry fruityness, finishing with a light tartness. Aftertaste is very solid sour cherry that lingers well in to the finish, enticing me to drink more and more of this beer. Very nice balance between fruit flavor and sour tinge. A mild sourness hangs on the sides of my tongue into the finish as well. Very excellent. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It doesn't interfere with the flavor while having enough carbonation to make it lively. Drinkability is awesome. No hint of the alcohol at all in this one. Its smooth and enjoyable while having a prominent sour character. The fruityness is excellent, and compliments the base beer excellently. Well worth the wait. 1,117 characterskmpitz2, Apr 20, 2006

4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Remarkable! A brilliant beer! 
A long-standing bottle pours a clear, deep-crimson-amber body beneath a full head of creamy light tan foam that holds exceptionally well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. The lacing could be better, but the retention is impressive.
The nose is sparkling with Brettanomyces and tartness; metal, oak, wet and oily leather, acetic acid, uric acid, chalk, must, damp newspaper, wet straw, papaya, plum, citrus rind, and cherry. 
It's delicately effervescent in the mouth with a medium body that leaves it quite smooth, a bit airy, and somewhat creamy despite it's initial spritz.
The flavor is just as the nose suggests, but with a much fuller character. The sourness appears upfront; followed by the delicate, tart fruit (cherry, papaya, summer berries); and then mustiness and some very drying oak in the finish. 
It's quite simply remarkably bizzare and flavorful, yet somehow completely pulled together and ultimately refreshing! It's astonishingly entincing, enaging, and almost consuming. 1,050 charactersNeroFiddled, Apr 01, 2006

Aroma of musty fruit with maybe some cherry, blueberry and raspberry evident. Some earthy soil and musty hay with a nit of weahtered leather as well.
Flavors of dark fruits, some licorice, a bit of pepper provide an amazing but almost confusing set of flavors.

Pours turbid, dark red, with an ambitious, spritzy head that falls immediately.
Hissing and prickling akin to a Schweppes.
Persistant release of carbonation not evident through the depths of the body, but revealing on the placid surface.
Sour cherries up front in the nose, with peppered leather and dusty boards.
Quite earthy and musty, with warming spice. 
Cinnamon bark, anise, cardamon, paprika, dried mint, and schezuan peppercorns step forward as it breathes.
A cedar chest in the loft of a barn, filled with spice satchels, dried cherries, and old leather soles.
Medium bodied, subdued carbonation, but still lively- juicy and crisp.
A moderate amount of tartness leads the pallet, with a zesty cherry kick and a drying woodiness.
Developes warm and spicy, with some continued puckering, and tannic drying.
Finishes lengthy with some playfull, musty funk- and warming, dried citrus zest.
Not over-the-top wild, but already quite complex, and another 3-5 years in the cellar should further "Supplicate" this Vinnie masterpiece further. 1,088 charactersbrewandbbq, Mar 12, 2006
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought this bottle (375 mL, olive green, batch 001) a month or two ago and finally mustered up the will to open it - which I had a hard time doing as the cork was a bit stubborn. I served it just below cellar temperature in a flute/goblet type glass I've got. It pours a beautiful hazed golden/orange/peach color with lots of carbonation and 2 fingers of tan head which consists of small bubbles and reduces to a half-inch, sticking to the glass throughout. It smells sharply tart with sweet and sour cherries, not-quite-fresh milk, oak, a good funkiness, and grapes, currants and blackberries which show up later. It's really making my mouth water wondering how it's gonna taste. It is sour/tart, but not as powerful as I thought it was going to be. There's also some malts, sour cherries, oak, the fruits I mentioned above, and some medicinal and vinous qualities. The pinot noir barrels in which it was aged contribute mainly to the aftertaste, which has grapes, blackberries, and currants, and a dry, woody coating effect similar to the few pinots I've tried. Initially the body is sharp and dry with a carbonation that is high but not prickly and it evolves from being light and airy to medium and smoother. Quite an interesting beer, and one that tastes like a gueuze mixed with a pinot noir. Hats off to Russian River for attempting such a mysterious creation. My only complaint, as others have noted, is that the bottle is too damn small, but other than that, keep up the good work. 1,490 charactersmmmbeer, Mar 09, 2006

Taste: Sour cherries, apple cider, tart apples, chardonnay grapes, and a slight lactic astringency. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Very drying to the palate.

Batch 001: Ruddy amber color with a thin light beige head that disappears almost immediately. Barely any light penetrates. Tiny rising bubbles and lacing that races down the sides of the glass. Aroma of grapes, brown sugar and sweet candy. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel, and a bold vinous character. Flavors of dark cherry and light spice and oak. The flavoring does not linger too long though. The finish is extremely dry and feels like it is sucking the moisture from your tongue as you drink it. The finish is moderately sour and peppery. Overall a very well-made and enjoyable beer. 626 charactersDogbrick, Feb 06, 2006

Retention is fabulous and the lace left behind is picture perfect. Beautiful aroma. Tart cherries and brown sugar and acidic properties and wood mingle delightfully on the nose. This beer starts with a mild tart, acidic attack of the palate. But as you drink on, this trait subsides and cherry skin, wine notes, oak properties and Brett-induced sourness surface. A light little prick of carbonation tantilizes the tongue. And the body of this beer is hovering just below medium or so. 
Gotta send thanks out to the Bum for yet another RRB product. It's much appreciated. 651 charactersBighuge, Feb 04, 2006
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours out a hazy, cloudy orange-red color with a tightly-packed beige head that held for quite a while and left a nice little lacing in the glass.
Smell is interesting, there's a definite white-wine aroma that wafts up out, with some juicy light fruits, but there's also a yeasty/vinegary side to it that gives it a lambic-like tartness. The cherries come through pretty clearly here, too. 
Flavor is interesting. Mildly acidic, but not a complete pucker-inducing ravage on your tongue. The lactic flavors blend well with the cherry flavors, and the oak comes through more clearly as it warms up a bit. The aftertaste is fairly acidic, but pleasantly so, and the wood lingers on this one in a very similar way to how it does in the Temptation. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and pretty lively.
Overall: This is a truly interesting brew, and although I don't love it quite as much as Temptation, I would highly recommend it if you want to try something funky and tart. One note, though, is that I really felt this one got much better as it warmed even after I served it at just under cellar temp. 1,102 characterswhartontallboy, Feb 01, 2006

After having this for several months, I finally broke down and opened it. The color is a nice amber/copper with very little head that disappeared quickly. The aroma was subtle: hints of cherry, oak and apples. As subtle as the scent was I didnt expect a big taste  I was wrong. It has a nice sour flavor with the entire cherry flavor coming through with a wine bit (something lighter  like a Pinot Grigio). The body is something akin to quality champagne  very crisp. Im glad I opened it, but I do wish I had more. This is a fine special occasion beer that I had no special occasion for.
Reading the label while I imbibe, its tells of all of the work that went into creating such a brew.: the 12 month aging in French oak Pinot Noir barrels for one year with three strains of Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, & Pediococcus. This is a labor of love, brewer Vinnie Cilurzo is clearly ahead of the curve in his creativity. 944 characterssloejams, Jan 30, 2006

Aroma of sour cherries and oak are clearly detectable. Taste has a clear sour cherries feel to it with some distinctive note of acidity and oak. Tartness was delectable but could have been more present. Even though this is an excellent Flemish sour, I though it could have had more tart and more complexity in general (i.e. De Dolle Oerbier Reserva). Id definitely take more RR Temptation over this any day. 518 charactersPhyl21ca, Jan 16, 2006

I served this one up in a tulip glass to help capture the aromas. The smell was that of a tart lambic with note of toasted oak. The yeast in the aroma was somewhat remeniscent of Orval. The flavor was full of tart cherries, oak, and chardonnay. The malt fills out the flavor and provides a medium mouthfeel. Considering this beer is 7% ABV, it's amazingly smooth - very drinkable. The carbonation is tight and compliments this beer's punch. Highly recommended if you can score a bottle. I recently went to Russian River Brewing and sampled 6 different Belgian beers on tap. All were excellent, but Supplication was notably different and much more complex than those on tap. 737 charactersSacoDeToro, Jan 06, 2006

375ml bottle
Hazy, peachy coppery bronze in hue with an amber highlight; the liquid is lovely, it has great color intensity. Off-white head, at the apex the foam was almost one finger high. The bubbles quickly faded to a thin, soapy cap and then a slim collar. There wasnt any subsequent lacing of note, just a couple spots of residue, what a pity. I do like how this beer looks; it is eye-catching but not jaw-dropping. 
The nose starts off vibrant, it is very tart. Sour cherries and hints of crabapples are the strongest aromas. Acidic, funky Brett notes, I also smell old wood. I guess it is the barnyard and barn I smell! There is even a smattering of vinegar at the back. The malt base meekly shows itself but clearly the lacto/wood/Brett/cherry combination is the show stealer. Moderate potency, the nose is complex, there is a great frame to the bouquet but it seems kind of skinny. In other words, the nose could fill in a little. With that said, the aromas that are present are great. Truly inviting, it is mouthwatering good. It is almost perfection.
Wow. It first the cherries are sweet and quite lovely. Next the malt shines, it tastes like a Brune for a moment. At this point the palate is very good. But, in the middle, oh my the tart, acidic cherries and vinous note emerges. By the finish are flavors of wood, leather, horse blanket, horsehair, crabapples, old orange peels, sour cherries, oak, and sharp acidity. I am truly impressed at the depth and complexity of the palate. Nothing smashed my tongue with a sledgehammer but everything played my tastebuds like an orchestra. It was a beery symphony. The aftertaste is a tug-of-war between sweet malt/cherries and sour cherries/Brett. I am the winner of this epic struggle. This is an amazing beer that my words could not pay it justice. 
Medium in body but this matters little with the mouthfeel. I cant think of many beers where the body is so irrelevant. The mouthfeel is all about the low, fizzy and soothing carbonation and the super refreshing acidity. Somehow  I dont really understand why  the mouthfeel is absolute perfect for this beer. It is amazing because there is nothing to it, just a soft body, a few bubbles and some sourness. It must be voodoo. 
Give me funky cheese, some grapes, some apples, some more bottles of this nectar and a glass. Astonishingly drinkable, this beer is so simple but so complex. It is genius. The warmer the beer became the sweeter and more luscious this beer turned out to be. If you love sour beers, you must try Supplication. I am happy I purchased a bottle online from RR, it was worth every cent. I highly recommended. Why did I wait so long to drink this gem! 2,727 charactersbditty187, Jan 04, 2006

Golden color with almost no head. Ton of carbonation going on though, which gives this a real lively appearance. Smell is all sour fruit but very inviting. Also some oak and cherry notes. Taste is sour like the smell but not overpowering. There are enough other interesting flavors to make it very enjoyable. Just so much going on i can really single individual flavors out, but in a very balanced way.
The mouthfeel is what made this beer for me. Very champaign like. Supper smooth and so active on the tongue. What an incredibly fascinating beer. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who wants to try something different. Not a typical beer by any means but a great example of creativity in brewing.

4.73/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Comes in 375 ml bottle with blue, black and white label. Labeled Batch 001. Sent to me in a beer trade with Lou91. Cork is hard to remove then suddenly comes out with one twist. Pours golden with perhaps a slight reddish pink tinge. Carbonation is quite pronounced. It reminds me of champagne. Head dissipates quite quickly leaving transparent large bubbles that lead to a thin film. 
Aroma is of extreme sourness combined with a musty oaky smell. A slight vinegar smell tells of sourness. 
First taste reveals - wow! The first thing I noticed is the softness and silky feeling of the beer. Mouthfeel is exceptional although some might say a tad on the thin side. Not as sour as the smell indicates. A little bit of a gueze taste with slight hint of cherries. Not pronounced cherry flavor. A coating of silk remains on the tongue for a while. This is not a big huge beer but subtle in it's flavor. The sourness is nice but not overpowering. I'm comparing this to a La Folie I had last night and that was orders of magnitude more sour. 
This stuff could be drunk in huge quantitites. I wonder why they make this in 375ml and La Folie in 750. Amazing that the wild bacteria could do this. One of the best tasting experiences I've had since starting beer advocate.
A real eye opener in terms of what can be done with beer in the U.S. 1,342 charactersmjohn27603, Jan 02, 2006
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours an amber cherry color with a thin uniform bubble head that is sustained by a few little bubbles from the bottom. There isnt any lace as the head just slides down the side. 
Smells strongly of oak with a bit of cherries, mandarin orange, raisins and a pungent chemical smell. 
The flavor is at first dominated by oak, but then transitions into a delightful wild cherry and sour milk flavor and then finishes with a clean oak that left my tongue tingling. 
The mouth feel is light to medium with a smooth carbonation. 
This is an awesome sipper. Definitely give this a whirl. 603 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Jan 02, 2006
3.6/5  rDev -20%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Poured from 375ml bottle stamped as "batch 001".
I bought this in CA a few weeks ago, and was really looking forward to trying it. The bottle says "Brown ale aged in oak barrels with cherries added." The bottle goes on to say it's aged for 1 year.
I had hoped for a different flavor out of this beer. I expected a wild ale, maybe a little sour due to the Brett. But this tasted mostly along the lines of a Rodenbach or La Folie. Extremely sour, with some cherry flavor in the background.
If you like Flanders Reds, then you should love this beer. If you expect something else (like I did), you'll be disappointed. 622 charactersTurdFurgison, Dec 31, 2005

Presentation- Batch #1, the first bottling. Have had in cellar for a good 1/2 year or so. Cute little 375ml or so caged and corked bottle. $7.50 at Ledger's. Seemed pretty steep at the time. Poured into my Duchesse De Bourgogne chalice.
Appearance- Off orange amber hazed pour. Clear on top and a clouded haze downward. Light 1/4 inch head at first and little lace, but I don't think lace is an issue with this beer.
Smell- Barnyard funk and was hoping there would be. Horse blanket and a bit of wet hay. Maybe a bit of cherry and some oak as well. Smells like rotting oak barrels.
Taste- At first, pretty tart, but that soon fades after the swallow. Decent amounts of malt at first and that mixes well with the sour tartness. I guess the malt kinda balances out the tart with a bit of sweetness. The cherry taste comes more predominant towards the middle of end of the bottle. Maybe I should have shook it up ;) Oak flavors are there as well. In fact oak hits first, then the tartness of a lighter tart lambic and them the nice sweetness of malt comes in. I think this is listed as a WIld Ale, but I would almost call it a Oud Bruin.
Mouthfeel- Incredibly clean and crisp taste. Almost no aftertaste at all. Medium carbonation level and while you a drinking the mouthfeel feels medium to full.
Drinkability- Wish I hadn't had the first half of this with cheese. Tried Camambert cheese for the first time and found I didn't like it's salty taste. So, the first part of my beer experience was muted. Thankfully I have another few bottles and can get a couple more before they disappear. Overall a really tasty beer. One that I will be sure to have again, hopefully many times. Quite a production from Vinnie...would you expect anything else though? Can't wait to have it again. 1,851 charactersGClarkage, Dec 25, 2005

A - a nice brassy orange color filled my tulip with a half finger of white head. Very bubbly inside with many small bubbles happily bubbling away.
S - tart apples and floral notes hit my nose with some spice. Tickeled a little bit.
T - A solid but not overpowering tartness glazes your tongue like an aged apple cider. Borders on green apple peels and sour cherries but ends with a sweetness and some spice. Great combination and complex.
M&Dr - Effervescent on a medium bodied brew ending on the somewhat dry side. Very tasty and drinkable.
I took 3 bottles home and have had 8 tulips of this beer before the keg was killed. 659 charactersSwillinBrew, Dec 21, 2005
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had been waiting for sometime to try Supplication. I missed it on tap at Monk's a few months back but I got a few bottles in Sonoma, CA at the Sonoma Wine Exchange and also a magnum at the brewpub. The beer I tasted was one of the small bottles. the magnum will sit in the basement waiting for a special occasion.
I poured the beer into a nice tulip glass and admired it for awhile. I got a nice thick bubbly, off white head that lingered for awhile. The fruit aromas you get from there beer are very pleasing. Cheeries and citrus. I really enjoyed the carbonation and tart taste in my Supplication. This definitely takes on some characteristics of wine or champagne which is a nice take on beer. I will surely be back for a few more bottles and hopefully find it on tap in the near future. 795 charactersggaughan, Dec 20, 2005
3.54/5  rDev -21.3%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5I think I like this beer more for what it aspires to be rather than for what it actually is. It is worth seeking and experiencing, but it is not easily appreciated. Or categorized.
Supplication is born from a highly complex recipe and ambitious aging regimen. It spends a full year in oak wine barrels with sour cherries, "wild" yeast, and two strains of friendly bacteria. It then undergoes a third fermentation in small corked bottles. With so many ingredients pulling in so many directions, the taste can be cluttered with one element obscuring or conflicting with another. The result achieves more convolution than integration. 
Lightly oaken colored with no visual suggestion of cherries, Supplication begins with a powerfully explosive uncorking followed by thready, sustained bubbles and a remotely indifferent head. The pungent sour cherry and white wine elements are easily detected in the nose. The taste harbors core woodenness and a tart acidic twang and leans towards a bubbly wine. It bears some resemblance to a wheatless lambic but none at all to a Belgian kriek. There is no defining malt profile to speak of and the hops are similarly obscured by the medley of microorganisms and their attendant fermentation signatures. 
I respect this beer a great deal but in the end there's just too much going on here for a singular identity to emerge and this makes Supplication difficult to approach. I found it not nearly as drinkable as Temptation or Damnation.

Poured into my wide-mouth Duvel tulip.
Poured a very murky orangy-apple cider color. Minimal head with a ton of small bubbles. The very fine lace stayed throughout and re-emerges with gentle encouragement. 
There is a galaxy of tiny black specs floating throughtout the beer, but settled to the bottom. Yeast? Cherry pit scrapnel? Not sure what it is. Had no adverse effects on this beer. 
Nose of sour cherry and earthy yeast mustyness. Enjoyably tart. Very vinous and smells of a well made hard cider. 
Not exactly sure how to catagorize what I'm tasting. It's unlike any beer I've ever tried before. Sour wild cherry and Brett takes presidence, along with musty fruit-cake, minus the nuts. Subdued hoppiness but there is a malty sweetness. Quite dry and woody. My vocabulary cannot express what I'm actually tasting. So much complexity here. Maybe it's not meant to be described. 
Very drinkable, smooth dry body. At 7% I wasn't expecting anything too heavy. Mouthfeel reminded me of a nice dry cider. 
Awsome beer from Russian River and Vinnie. Like I said before, unlike anything I've previously had. Almost too good for words. 1,179 charactersBrewfan, Nov 29, 2005

Poured it into a weizen glass. Beer was a copper color and head started at about 2inches and was cream colored.
Taste was a dry mixture of malts, wood and cherries. yes, cherries. The dry texture of this beer is considerably more like a wine to me. But make no mistake, it is all beer. The finish was very woody. Like I just chewed on a wood popsicle stick.
The smell is cherry. I was sitting in a dining chair with the glass near my lap and that was all I could smell.
Not bad, but I wouldn't call it a drinker. Definitely has alot of craftsmanship involved. I would have it again on another special occaision. 701 charactersBitterBrian, Nov 25, 2005

a strong lambic, strawberry, currant type mix hits me up front. Malted sweetness and grape finish the nose. interesting to say the least.
Carbonation is sizzling and overpowering but when its finished the overall taste is of young fruit. Imagine picking up an unripe pack of strawberries and grapes, mashing them together and you've got the general idea. Finishes with a touch of malt sweetness and clean.

If you don't like authentic lambics, saisons or flanders red ales then I'd suggest you stay away from this one.
If you, however, do like those styles then belly up to the bar.
Pours a pretty, hazy, burnt orange color with a bit of head; not stunning to the eye but reasonabley inviting.
Smells quite delicious. One of the more fragrant beers I've encountered in quite some time. You get a hint of the tart and tangyness to come (a little like freshly squeezed and squozen lemonade), a hint of cherries...
The taste really assaults the palate. Lambic meets saison meets flanders red. San Francisco sour dough. This is the most elegant use of wood aging I have yet to encounter in a beer; the wood is there but it is harmonious with the other elements. 
Hard not to guzzle.
A pretty classy ho. 992 charactersommegangpbr, Nov 18, 2005

A small head coats the sides as you drink this bad boy down. Cherries are front and center followed by the taste of a nice champagne yeast, unlike anything I have ever tasted in a beer before. This was followed by the nice flavors of a mild brown ale. Tart, but not overly slow with a tangy middle and a nice ale finish. Just a real gem. 471 charactersNolanGTI, Nov 14, 2005

This one poured into my chalice a hazy orange-amber with a half-finger head. It subsided to a thin layer, but remained throughout the experience.
Aroma was vinous, some sweet fruit (I know there's cherries, but it wasn't distinctive),and hints of oak. I noticed a little vanilla and a bit of a medicinal tang that was not unpleasant. Excellent
The taste was tart, a little sour, and vinous, with some cherry sweetness and some oaken notes. Extraordinary. Even the aftertaste was great.
Mouthfeel was tart and a little puckering, but not too much. Not as thin as I would have expected, very very good for the style.
Drinkability was wonderful. I saved this for an extra-special occasion, and this was well worth it.

Hazy peach with a large fluffy head that dies down pretty quickly. Smell is very strong - floral and herbal characters along with a vinegary smell dominate. There is definitely some sour cherry in there, and a woody smell. Taste is more of the same. The taste is a tad muted, but well done. A tiny bit of spicy alcohol shows through but other than that it is well hidden. The sourness is mild in this brew compared to most of the Belgian lambics I've had, but the cherry taste seems to come out more, along with a vinous character. Finish is very clean with some lingering oak. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style, pretty thin. Could use a bit more carbonation. Drinks very easily. Very interesting brew. 717 charactersPatYoda, Nov 08, 2005

Lovely aroma of earth with a slight mustiness, behind it all a bright "sense" of cherries. Great cherry sourness in the flavor. Spiciness abounds-somewhat peppery though NOWHERE near as "hot" spice-wise as Catillion's Rose d Gambrinus, which I liken this to. The tart/sweet combo is amazing. Great body. Quite amazing. This is a lot more my speed then the similar Catillion products. A damn fine beer and a great product by American brewers for sure. 566 characterslackenhauser, Nov 05, 2005

The smell is intoxicating, with cherry, oak, and wild yeast very apparent. The taste starts with a bit of malt up front with cherry on top of oak taking over quickly. Sourness remains in the mouth. The mouthfeel is tart while the drinkability is amazing.

Poured an incredibly murky brown. Really like thinned out muddy water. Thin head that dissolved almost completely but for a ring of thin bubbles around the edges.
Nose is full of cherries with some woodiness coming out towards the back of the nose.
Flavor is really nice. I got some nice flavors from the yeast. But the cherries nearly overpowered everything else and did a great job concealing the alcohol. Cherries are both sweet and sour. Slight wood flavors come out at the end.
Mouthfeel has a very dry finish. The cherries linger throughout and afterwards. Makes me think of a light red wine.
Found myself holding the bottle over my glass trying to milk out any remaining drips or drops of beer in there. 765 charactersMuddyFeet, Oct 21, 2005

A most unusual taste. Full bodied, and utterly weird. Bold fruit, forward and beautifully blended. Cherries are on top, but don't dominate, there's a greater complexity, made more confounding by the tartness that abounds.
Gets mellower as we sip, and wider, too...more open, spacious, ...with incessant bursts of cherry-licious flavor...me, oh, my...

Pours a hazy deep amber color with some red hints smaller kaki head that falls to a ring pretty fast hints of lace is it.
Aroma is musty funky wet horses brett mixed with tart fruit cherries, peaches some light vinager dry wood aromas hints of vanilla. As is warms cherries come out more also a yogurt aroma noted.
Taste is well very nice tart cherries moving right into the funky flavors puckering your mouth vinager and red wine like qualities appear and fade to dry wood flavors and hints of vanilla and a lingering tartness. So far this is the only wild ale that reminds me of a Flanders Red must be the cherries. Overall a nice beer Vinnie has here.
Mouthfeel is little lighter then medium nice dry adds to the tartness.
Drinkability is good only thing hurting this one is price I think about 10 at the Vintage Cellar when they have it. Thanks to George I now have one in my cellar :) 1,087 charactersmntlover, Oct 05, 2005
4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Presented in an oddly shaped 375ml bottle with a blizzard of info about the beer on the label. Turns out this was batch #001. Cost: $9.99 at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA.
Poured into a goblet, Supplication showed off a faintly maroon coloration, a long-lasting pink-tinged head, and lots of gummy lace. The head was easily re-formed with a quick swirl of the glass.
The nose was quite complex with a sharply sour lambic-like aroma. Cherry notes were evident as were aromas of Brett-created wet animal hides, oak wood, and the vinous notes of red wine. Very faint note of vanilla also.
Complexity doesn't let up at the nose, that's for sure! Immediate tannic acid bite infused with sour cherries. Woody mid-palate, but only briefly. Tart and slightly soured milk taste along with vino and musty funk. Red wine influence and dryness really comes across in the finish. The feel was medium/light in body, quite dry and tartly acidic.
Man, this was really good; so easily drinkable. At $10 I wanted to savor it yet had a tough time pacing myself to get the fullest enjoyment possible from the all-too-small bottle. Another gem from the creative minds at Russian River. 1,170 charactersBoilermaker88, Sep 29, 2005

Aroma is very complex, Brett initially, some estery yeast character, malt and just a hint of fruit. Color is somewhere between amber and red. A little cloudy. Small but persistant head.
Initial flavor is fine sour cherry juice. Mid-palate, Brett takes over giving a tart and refreshing impression. There's a substantial caramel malt aftertaste. Further tasting includes nice oak and red-wine like flavors. No one of these flavors is dominant. They all combine to make-up an incredibly complex mixture.
Medium to full bodied. Fine evervescent carbonation. Creamy, not warming. Very pleasant to drink.
Really nice beer. Picked up a few extras to cellar. Wondering how the fruit will change as it's pretty subtle now. May fade entirely. 779 charactersczechsaaz, Sep 26, 2005

Immediately upon uncorking, the nose became most evident. Chardonnay tone from a distance, saison/gueze-like up close with a formidable Bret presence as well as sour cherries and Belgian yeast. Simply exceptional.
Reddish/orange body capped with a full finger of tiny-bubbled white foam with decent clarity for an unfiltered offering.
Silky carbonation tickles the underside of the tongue upon entryand the sour cherries are the first impression...quickly overtaken by the funky Bret and an unmistakable dryness on the center/rear of the tongue. Layer after layer of funky Bret, sweet fruits, and oak inspired dryness constitute the midtaste.
Mouthfeel is light and airey and the finish champagne dry with the funk of Bret and other bacilli lingering long after the swallow.
As this brew warms it becomes even funkier...simply out of this world!!! 895 charactersIceAce, Sep 19, 2005

Appearance-Pours into a chalice a hazed apricot body awash with carbonation. Small offwhite head is shortlived, but leaves a shimmering chain of sheet lace to grace the rim of the chalice. 
Aroma-Very Kriek-like, with tart cherries and acidic lemon. More complex than a lambic, with accents of red wine, clean yeasty funk, vinegar, and a powerful note of woody oak. 
Mouthfeel- Light medium body with moderated carbonation. Tingly and tannic.
Taste- Very complex and highly detailed. Immediately tannic, sour, and acidic. Sour cherry blends with red and white grapes, atop a very oaky and woodsy character. Yeasty funk is clean, airy, and outdoorsy. Some hints of caramel malt try to balance the tartness, but without success. Lemon and tangerine notes linger on the palate. 
Drinkability- This one reminds me of an oaky, Flanders Red Ale blended with a geuze. Very satisfying sipper that is quite tasty and refreshing. Complexities abound. Very expensive stuff here. I could have purchased a Rochefort 10 for the price of this one. I'm going to lay down my other bottle for a few months and see what happens. 1,193 charactersmerlin48, Sep 17, 2005
4.22/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Muddy amber-orange. Surprisingly buttery nose takes a minute to get accustomed to. Good oaky, cherry, dusty and woody flavours underneath, but the diacetyl is a wall you have to filter your way through. Spicy pineapple juice soaked in oak casks, nutty and lactic flavours.. Once again a territory owned by rancid butter, but the lactic aspects are gentle. Popcorn reminiscent finish in its burnt buttery feel. Nice thin bubbled carbonation, lightly oily medium body. Alright, it seems like we were unlucky and Im excited enough about Russian River to re-sample that again for sure, at GABF in the worst case, but may this rating serve as a warming. This was a batch #1 bottle and I can only push the lucky souls holding onto bottles of this to be very patient and let it ferment well because it seems the bottles are still quite variable. 
A few weeks after, I finally got to try this on tap at BCTC 2005 and there was no diacetyl component at all which left us with beautiful vinous, nutty sweet and sour flavors of cherries, vanilla and a miraculous drying finish. Generous earthiness with a funky soily apple skin yeastiness. This goes from a 2.8 to a 4.1 in my book and is a piece of art. 1,197 charactersRastacouere, Sep 12, 2005

Sweet and sour vinous aroma, tart cherries and hints of yeast spiciness. Bubblegum is present as well, possibly some candi sugar character. "Candy floral" comes to mind. Maybe honey? Kind of mysterious, very good.
Vinous and sour start with a sweet candi sugar-like side that shows up nearer the middle. Super tart cherries with a subtle hop twang. Wild yeast funk lends a bit of a chewed bubblegum flavor. Bitterness in the finish from that subtle hopping, which is almost a surprise. Subdued piney character at the very end. Leaves an almost leafy presence under the sourness. Hops show up more as it warms a bit.
Very nice! A strange and wonderful creation. This is certainly a thinking beer. I'm very impressed with the hopping and the overall complexity. I can't wait to have more from Russian River, this is my first experience. 891 charactershyuga, Sep 04, 2005

Aroma is very inviting...subtle sour cherries w/ hints of the pinot noir barrels this offering was aged in.
The taste is quite tart...cherries are not overbearing and a definite vinous quality. Finishes slightly bitter...more tart IMO.
The mouthfeel and carbonation are perfect for the style...both very quenching/refreshing, even served at room temperature.

Looks like wood, in a good way, wood. Like a backyard porch. Cloudy due to yeast. Some head, not much. Not much lacing.
Smell. Oddly enough, the best feature of this beer. When first opened, the smell was a dead-ringer for a cabernet sauvignon. Then, you could pick out the cherries.
Torn about the taste. Taste is very, very good. The brett and the sour cherries interact with a lot of complexity. Nice and tart, but not so intense that it is unbearable. If I had more discrete points, I would give this a 4.75. I will definitely be revisiting this beer at a later date to see how the bottle I have left from my stop at the brewery matures. This one, picked up from Tria, is much more mature and much better then the fresh bottle I got from the brewery itself.
Drinkable? All day long, baby. All day long. 993 charactersGeoffFromSJ, Aug 31, 2005
4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The beer poured into the chalice clear deep amber light brown with a medium off-white head which lasted well to lace the glass.
The aroma was low levels of acidity coupled with a light fruitiness when first poured. After warming a bit the aromatic changed to light tannins of oak and vanilla coupled with a nice fruit complexity of cherries which would have been almost indistinguishable had the thought not been placed in my head from the label.
The flavor was light with a definite cherry flavor that was not forced nor artificial. The oak presence was powerful and refined with a brett flavor that led to a complex character of cherries and slightly sour breadiness. The flavors were full and rounded with the cherries notable when the beer first contacts the palate and then the flavors change with a bready citric and acidic sourness that was mildly presented and never overdone. A complex presentation that contained oranges, lemons and limes on a level that resides just below and behind the other characteristics of the flavor.
The finish was almost dry with a lasting bready and citrus coupled with cherry impression into the aftertaste. The body was just below medium and well done. The beer was extremely interesting and complex, though not one I would place extremely high on the drinkability chart.

Huge nose that assaults the nose with Brett, cherries and other alcohol-bathed fruits.

4.29/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4As I was drinking this beer I kept thinking to myself what restraint the brewer used in all the components added to the mix. This led me to realize that some remarkable craftsmanship went into the making of this beer.
Another brewer might have tried to make this into a big taste salad by upping the flavor profile. That would be a mistake in my opinion. This beer has many interlocking smells and flavors that each stand on their own and interplay with each other. An incredible job.
It pours slightly hazed orange red with no discernable solids in the body, but it was not clear. The head on the pour was nice and solid and lowered to a skim after a minute or so.
I think I dipped my nose in the glass more than I sipped. The smell is quite incredible. It starts with more of a slightly sour smell with some cherry pits, but as it warms it takes on a more winey character with a definite cedar smell. I really enjoyed the smell of this beer. It had many distinct but subtle smells - light balsamic vinegar, cherry pits, cedar, brown sugar, red wine, and a damp sweet earthiness. Truly amazing.
Taste was quite good as well, but not as complex as the nose. It had a light sour character that interplayed with some sweetness and a dry woodiness.
Mouthfeel was spot on - moderately thick, creamy carbonation and a slight drying.
What a great sipper. 1,366 characterssilenius, Aug 20, 2005

Appearance: Opened my very unsettled bottle -- basically exploded when opened despite having sit still and upright for 45 minutes -- to find a slightly cloudy cherrywood with honey undertones. Fine champagne carbonation. No real head to speak of, although a thin layer of rose foam was present throughout.
Smell: The scent is wild indeed. Woody, vinous, tartly fruity, but also a bit musty and rich. Probably a good many things I don't know to look for happening as well. Becomes sweet and slightly malty as it warms, a bit more akin to its brown ale heritage.
Taste/Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is thin and again quite champagne-like. The taste is a real joy; tart, dry and fruity, yet wonderfully earthy as well. The aftertaste is literally woody, not vanilla oak, but rather like sucking on a wood chip. Yeast spice and fruit sourness lingers.
Drinkability: Well, let's be frank: if this were available in conventional six-packs, they'd run you about $50, so to say this is "drinkable" might be a stretch. Still, as an occasional treat, it's a unique and tasty example of the craft to be sure. Made me smile. I have another sitting in the cellar -- we'll see what a year does to it. 1,230 charactersWetCoaster, Aug 18, 2005

S: Very nice aroma and pungent. Sour with a touch of phenols. Apples and spice with some sweetness and an underlying woody / mushroomy note.
T: Sweet and sour up front fading to a spiciness and finishing dry and woodsy. Alcohol starts to come through at the finish. There's definitely a tanin note from the wine barrell againg.
M: Thick and smooth with perfect carbonation.

O: This is unique and delicious. Proof that if you take the care in brewing a beer you would in creating a fine wine, the results can be just as mind blowing. 597 charactersejquin, Aug 13, 2005

4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Small corked and caged 375ml. from batch #1. The cork comes out with quite a loud pop. Appears a murky deep orange with good sized off white head. Pretty good amount of sticky scattered lace covering the glass. The tart aroma hits you as soon as you pour this. As it warms funky yeast and woody scents come out more. Lighter notes of cherries and other lighter fruits appear at times as well. Flavor is equally complex with a big tartness and a smaller balancing sweetness coming on strongest. Plenty of interesting yeast things going on including the brett funkiness. Oak notes and sour cherries play into it as well. Some vinous notes at times. Dry sourness on the aftertaste. About a medium body with a dry, tart and tangy feel to it. I found it also quite refreshing. Very interesting stuff it keeps you coming back for more trying to figure out every thing that is going on. By the end of the glass though my palette seemed a bit wore out from all the flavors but I would have gladly drank a 750 of this. Excellent all around brew a must try. 1,047 charactersmeathookjones, Aug 03, 2005
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have had 2 opportunities to try this beer in the last week (once in a great beach bar, and the other in the comfort of my home), and so this review is a mix of both opportunities. In the bar, it was served at perfect temperature, at home I was too impatient and it was too cold when I served it.
Pours a slightly hazy orange-red with minimal head when cold, but a nice off-white head when poured in a Damnation chalice. 
Aroma is full, slightly sour, with a wonderful cherry-dark berry overtones. Wood. Complex.
Flavor takes the aroma and runs with it. Tart cherries. Sharp and overly sour when cold, but balances nicely when closer to cellar temperature. It becomes more mellow, cherries more fruity, edges removed from sourness, wood notes more pleasant. Oh, my this is wonderful.
Mouthfeel is rich, but not in the Tripel/Quadrupel way, but just because it sits in the mouth so happy. Dry but more complex than that. And it is so drinkable I thought there was a hole in the bottom of my glass.
One of the best I've had in a long time. 1,053 charactersDukeofearl, Aug 03, 2005
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4My wife was visiting her parents in Vallejo over the fourth, and went through Santa Rosa on her way to a spa treatment at Osmosis, just outside of Sebastopol (I think). I had cajoled her into stopping in at Russian River on her way back and picking up anything that wasn't either Damnation (of which I have thre bottles in the basement) or Sanctification (which I'd already had). She came back with one bottle each of Temptation and Supplication.
Appearance: Gorgeous. Pours into my wine goblet a light golden brown, then as the glass fills it exposes its murky, cherry-colored heart. This is a beer with gentle secrets.
Smell: The oak from the pinot barrels is really the predominant smell, but it backs away to expose the light fruitiness of the cherries, brett and candy sugars. 
Taste: Very, very nice. Again, light and fruity (almost like a chardonnay), but the oak and the cherry truly take over in the middle, with the oak politley excusing itself and allowing the cherry to dominate the finish. A light alcohol warming once the beer comes up to temperature.
Mouthfeel: Exquisite. Gentle, but weighty. This is a 7% beer that isn't shy about throwing it's weight around, however, it isn't overpowering. A wonderful balance.
Drinkability: This is hard to quantify. I have to say a four, because I think I could (at most) drink maybe three glasses of it. It's a sipping beer, a conversational beer, not a session beer. 1,437 charactersKnuckles, Jul 29, 2005
4.46/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I noticed almost all of these reviews came out of a bottle, so I figured I'd pour a keg review. I was able to get this on tap at O'Brien's in San Diego in July.
The server poured a 6 oz glass with no head on it; at first glance, except for being dressed in a small Chimay glass goblet, this could have been any amber ale. Looking closer it had nice legs and was slightly hazy; both features came as no surprise considering the wild yeast that is added to the aging casks.
There is not a long nose on this beer, though the sour cherry scent is apparent.
The first sip takes a second to register and then the sour flavor rolls from the front of the tongue to the back. After sipping a bit, I read that this beer was aged in used Pinot Noir barrels, and immediately recognized the flavor of the grape buried in the cherry. The sourness lingers a long time, but doesn't get tiring.
About halfway through the glass I started eating a salad with a spicy dressing, and each sip of the Supplication brought the spiciness back to the surface of the tongue in a very pleasant way. I usually associate hops with spiciness; I'm not sure what characteristic of this beer brings it out.
I would recommend this beer for belgian lovers as well as beer aficianados trying to mature the tastes of a yellow beer or red wine drinking friend with an open mind. 1,354 charactersjbmorch, Jul 27, 2005
4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance and Presentation  Batch 001. Cool 12.7 oz caged and corked bottle. The beer pours a fantastic color, amber, orange and red all interplay. On top of the slightly hazy beer is an off-white head with good retention and lacing.
Smell  Right off the bat the cherries are superb, just like dried sour cherries. Not an overwhelming smell but really engaging.
Taste  Up front there are sweet and sour cherries as it moves back the cherries taste dried and tart. There is some sweet malt there throughout, but the cherries are the main player. It is right between sweet and sour, a great balance. This probably has the best fruit flavor of any beer that I have had, if you have ever had dried sour cherries this beer tastes just like that. There are no hops present, but they are certainly not missed.
Mouthfeel  Medium bodied with stiff carbonation. Perfect and smooth.
Drinkability and Notes  Insanely drinkable. Many fruit wilds/lambics are either too sour or too sweet, Russian River has found exactly the right blend with this beer. Definitely get your hands on this if you can find it and dont mind paying a considerable amount to get a small bottle.
Update: After a year I drank my second bottle, the strong cherry has melded into a perfect balance with the malt and matured brett character... A different beer then it was, but as good if not better. 1,386 charactersOldSock, Jul 27, 2005

375ml corked bottle, makes a loud pop when opened. Pours a murky garnet hue into my goblet, makes a thin white head of very fine bubbles. Aroma is earthy with sweet dark fruits, bit of caramel and yeast. Flavor is acidic and sour... huge profile of sour cherries... a bit bready, peppery, moderately dry and bitter. Solid meduim palate leaving very thin syrup coating in the mouth, carbonation is high with a likeness to champagne and a warm finish. I like this alot, it is an excellent offering from Russian River. Highly recommended! 549 characterskmcnair, Jul 26, 2005
4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Small 375ml corked and caged bottle that is elegantly labeled and informative. Batch 001. The cork produces a loud pop with wisps of white into the air. Poured into my SN tulip a amber orangish red with rising bubbles that create a tight eggshell head. The color of an autumn afternoon. As my nose reaches the glass I'm left nearly speechless. Dew covered freshly picked sour cherries meld with aged woody tones. Vinous sour grapes peek out as well, all touched with a musty, funky yeastiness. Vinegar and lactic acid come to mind with each inhalation. Each aroma seems to have its place in the overall beauty of this unique offering.
My first sip brings a conglomeration of sour cherries and grapes awash in a sea of slightly dry woody tannins. The slight hint of sweet caramel collides with a vibrant, earthy, musty yeastiness imparted by the brettanomyces. A bit acidic with a lactic twang and vinegar undertones. Exceddingly complex and challenging on the palate. Each sip causes me to envision the barrel this magnificent liquid called home for a year, where the amazing wild yeasts and bacteria did their part to help create a truly awe inspiring beer. A tart, vinous finish leaves traces of pinot noir and oak dangling on the back of the tongue.
Smooth and creamy with virbant carbonation that dances across the palate. Each subsequent sip leaves me in anticipation of the next. I really wish this bottle was 750ml as I'm dreading the end of my glass and I could lust after each sip of this beer all day. Truly a work of brewing art if there ever was one and without a doubt one of the most complex, unique and well built beers that has ever graced this beer drinkers lips. Highly recommended and not to be missed. Vinnie has created a masterpiece that I sincerely hope to have the pleasure of drinking again. Many thanks to irishsnake for the amazing opportunity. 1,877 charactersorbitalr0x, Jul 23, 2005
4.87/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.512.7 oz bottle purchased by way of skyhand (thanks again kim for sending me this stuff). Very cool looking bottle.
Pours a bit orange with a rosy hue. Head is small, well defined, and dense, but alas quickly vanishes into a nice crown of lacing and a spiffy off-white collar.
Smell is...well, exceptional doesn't begin to describe it. Faint sour cherries lag in the background and are enveloped by an inviting woody aroma. The typical brett funk is there, but is undercut both by the wood, and the exceptionally wine-like character of the nose. As usual with this type of beer, there is some mustiness to smell, but also with this type of beer I look for it (as well as look forward to it).
Taste is sour cherries up front, followed by a bit of lactic tartness. There it somehow trails off and slowly the oak flavors, pinot grapes, slight hop bitterness creep onto the palate as well as a resurgence of the slight twang of wild tartness and cherry flavors. An extremely complex beer. I've never experienced a beer where the flavor comes in waves rather than all at once. It's not very hard to discern the individual flavors of this beer, but it sure is hard trying to place them all. Alcohol is present as this one slowly is sent down the throat.
Mouthfeel...outstanding. Carbonation is perfect, mouthfeel is just what I want in a beer like this, not something that sticks around forever, but something that stays around long enough to enjoy fully.
Overall. The only reason that this beer isn't straight 5s is due to the fact the flavors are very strong in this and quite simply, I couldn't have more than one in a single sitting. Apart from that though, I don't see much fault in this beer at all. I kind of consider myself lucky to have been able to try it. Wow. 1,769 charactersLuckySevens82, Jul 23, 2005
4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is truly a wow nose of wild yeast cherry goodness that I whiffed like a cigarette inhale after the loud pop from the champagne cork. Hazy, orange amber color with not much head on the pour. I was not sure if this would be better cold or warmer so I took a big first drink and it was as good as the nose. It had tremendous layers of flavors with an easy to approach funkiness and tartness allowing the cherries to balance this complexity and hold it together. As it warms and your palate starts to love the tartness, the buttery oakiness adds yet another layer of flavor and the cherry flavors come forward beautifully. It was $8.00 for a 12oz bottle at Ledgers  pricey but worth a try to see what American brewers are capable of when their obsession matches their talent. 784 characterslou91, Jul 20, 2005
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Opens with a big "pop." Vermillion-brown with a nice layer of foamy suds adorning the top of the beer. An exceedingly woody nose full of dry rot and tiny hints of cedar. Always wary of American beers that advertise their funkiness, I was prepared to be let down by a lack of brett and/or bacteria, but the nose was both moderately tart and funky and hinted at a very pleasant sour cherry flavor that might be coming my way.
While the cherry flavor never fully emerged, I was certainly treated to a subtly sour beverage that was impressively well balanced and dry. If one could register a complaint, it's that a leisurely approach to drinking this allows it warm to the point where a slightly boozy red wine burn develops that distracts from the interesting funk and wood flavors present in the beer. Nonetheless, quite an accomplishment. 840 charactersmarburg, Jul 13, 2005
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured a cloudy, bloodied bronze with one finger of head with decent retention.
The aroma is initially all lactic sourness, but this gives way to a big, musty, horse-funk that then dominates. There's a bit of warm, woody breadth in the back, and I'm looking for the cherries but I'm not finding them - yet...
Tingly-tart all over the tongue, and just when you recover, the brett-funk dryness comes in to attack. Despite the obvious and major role of lacto, brett, and pediococcus, the beer isn't *completely* dry. An impression of malt remains, along with a subdued but disctinct sweet fruit element (the cherries?)
Another amazing, boundary-pushing beer from Vinnie. I only wish I had another bottle to cellar. I have a strong suspicion that this beer will become doubly amazing with a few years on it... 814 charactersCrotor, Jul 08, 2005

Cork comes off with a pop, releasing a sour flemish like aroma. Pours an enticing burnt amber/cherry color with a tiny head that quickly vanishes leaving minimal lacing. Musty, funky aroma of cherry and oak... Mildly sweet acidic flavor that quickly transforms into a lambic like tartness.
As if they took some of the best qualities of my favorite krieks, guezes, and sour flemish ales and blended them into one with a dash of complexity and smoothness that makes this go down incredibly easy.
A shame the bottle is so small, as this is extremely enjoyable... wish I had more than half a bottle to taste, but glad niftypat shared it with me.. definetly need to find some more bottles of this 730 characterseclectic, Jul 04, 2005

appearance: yellow to orange to red.. spectrum of beer imagery in my fischer flute glass. bubbly but no head or lacing anywhere to be seen. cloudy formation of ex-carbonation on the surface
aroma: brett smell, cuts off abruptly with a pronounced cherry-vanilla sweetness. rounds out the nose with an interesting buttery addition. unique in its blend.
taste: im introduced to this beer by a champagne-like dryness. malty with cherries like a sugar-coated muffin.. sour yeasty equine backup contributes to the flavor but not as much as i would have guessed. lots of lacto sourness in the aftertaste.. when all is said and done i am left thinking about a white wine heavy on light fruit notes.
i could drink this all day, drinkability has nothing playing against it. wish i could test my limits, but a 375 between 3 people is not going to give me much of an indication.
for a beer, this is something else. leaps and bounds beyond the flemish wild ales, but just a tad bit less crazy than the hype will lead you to believe. 1,039 charactersgoodbyeohio, Jul 04, 2005

(Brewed on 11-Apr-04 and Bottled on 28-May-05)
Primary: Bastogne Ale Yeast (White Labs)
Conditioning: R.R. Wine 1
Listed as:
7.0%ABV / 1.064 O.G / 27 BUs
Presentation: 12.70 fluid ounce (375ml) greeny-brown glass bottle which has a rather unique look to it, flask like the dimpled underside and wide base with the tall proboscis like neck lend it a wine bottle feel. Single blue label is literally saturated with information about this brew. Principle data is that this is a brown ale aged for over 12 months in pinot noir wine barrels, during that period sour cherries, Brettanomyces, lactobacillus, saccharomyces and pediococcus are added. Refermented in the bottle, it is listed at 7.00% Alc. By Vol.
Listed as Batch 001. Cork and Caged with a white steel cap which has the words Russian River Brewing Company on it. 
Appearance: Turbid ruddy sunset red-orange body that lays a rust bloom rainbow on my keyboard as the light from my desk lamp refracts through my Gueuze glass. Shame on me, I disobeyed the advice on the label, it recommends a Duvelian Goblet and not a straight sided glass, but I like to go against the grain (grape?) once in a while. The head forms into a manageable off-white beige covering that leaves a disappearing sliding lacing on the straight sided glass walls. Gentle swirls reveal a fizzing dissolved carbonation that regresses slowly. Final pour forms a lovely looking light brown uniform cap that stays around for some time.
Nose: Mild brown ale feel with some leathery sourness that prevails throughout. Hints of sour cherries and a gentle acidic distilled acerbic cherry essence in the back end. Light but sharp, cutting woody tones, soaked wooden wine barrels with a cold damp barn odor that hangs heavy. Wild yeasty finish cuts the resilient vinegary cherries and leaves you with a tingling nasal passage. 
Taste: Starts with some sweetness, it flies quickly into a malty sour Brune which has a distinctive Belgian parentage that has benefited from a sunny education in the Wine laden region of Santa Rosa. The sour cherry rises in the middle but finishes with a red grape feel which imparts a warming glow on the tongue and cheeks. Immense talent shines in the relative youngster, it has a long way to go, and it is going to be one to keep an eye on. Established Lambic like character meets a Vino Youngster.
Mouthfeel: Acidic, dry, sharp, tingly, flashingly lambic-like, fleetingly sweet, prevalently sour, shockingly big. Take a mouthful of this, swirl it in the aural cavity, the feel of the dissolution of the dissolved carbonation is fucking huge, enough to produce a nasal backwash burp and cherry flavored bogies. The swallow is dessicacringent (I think that is a new word I just invented) followed by a cherry laden lambic twang with a low lying cheek pulling Kriek feel. 
Drinkability: I hear that this one is gonna be available in 1.5 liter Magnums soonwonder if they will sell those by Mail Order? Im seriously tempted if they do. Needless to say, 12.7 fl.oz. is just *NOT* enough!! Dump the little bottles and start sticking this one in 750s as at least as a minimum Vinnie.
Overall: Nice to try this one fresh, so to speak, but it is going to be a real pleasure to watch this one grow up.
Wine meets Beer.
Belgium meets the USA.
Flanders meets Northern California.
Art meets Brewer.

A- Hazed orange amber with a showing of active carbonation, awesome lacing ... it literally sticks every where.
S- Tartness of a lambic but clean like an American ale. Well maybe not totally clean as there is a mild cellar / barn yard character from the wild yeast in the aroma. I can barely pick out the sour cherries in the aroma as the wood blankets the nose. Fruit cake?
T- A thick layer of bready malt runs up against a solid tartness, both don't collide yet they meld together. Big wild yeast flare with a weathered hop bite in the middle. Big snap of tartness flows with a mild sweetness from the cherries and malt. The woodiness is more of back ground character yet adds more complexity to the brew than anything else IMO. More tartness and a growing woody dryness in the finish.
M- Creamy with a bitty wood bite that leads to a dry palate.
D- So easy to quaff that I struggled to savor every drop.
By far the best American beer I have had this year, It is beers like this that inspire and show where modern American brewers can go ... there are no boundaries. 1,148 charactersJason, Jun 29, 2005

Dark orangeish/red with a nice head of light beige/tan foam that dies kind of quickly, but is easily revitalized by swirling my oversized wine glass. Some lace is present as well and it is quite sticky and leaves some interesting patterns. The aromas are all brett, lacto, and sour cherry/oaky funk. Beautiful. The taste is a beautiful blend of funk, oak, cherries, acidic notes, and more. The mouthfeel is super creamy, smooth, and this beautiful brew just slides down ones throat. Drinkability is perfect as well. This is similar yet different than Alexander Rodenbach, but man this stuff is probably better! Just a brilliant Flemish red sort of hybrid oaky cherry brew. 704 charactersfrancisweizen, Jun 01, 2005
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance  This one is a bright orange in color and very cloudy with a moderate head that went down rather quickly as is typical of the style. The liquid though just lit up the room.
Smell  The big malted notes and controlled sourness are in perfect balance at the nose. I am amazed at how exactly even the balance here is between the malts and sour fruits. The cherries are most dominant I think but there are lots of other sweets in here.
Taste  The brown malts here are just gorgeous. I just love the wonderful Belgian lightly-toasted malts and how they played with the sourness of this ale. The sour flavors are extremely refined. This is not a hurtful sourness or something meant to knock you off your barstool. This is a sour flavor, mated equally with the malt, to encourage a broader acceptance of this style.
The fruits are exciting and, again, could be appreciated by those unfamiliar with this style not commonly found here in the US. The cherries are the most prominent, but I can pick up a diverse sugary complexity that consists mostly of citrus and darkish fruits like dark berries.
The lambic nature of this ale is unmistakable. This is like a great raw lambic with incredible smoothness mated to big Belgian malts and some nice fruits.
Mouthfeel  This one is medium-bodied with some comfortable sourness in the mouth and a light bitterness at the very end. Even the finish is balanced.
Drinkability  This is the first sour Belgian Ale that I wanted to drink all night. I really had a hard time finding fault with this Russian River offering.
Comments  This was an early preview of Vinnies next batch that will condition in the bottle for another nine months or so prior to release. Im not sure how much better this one can get, but I want to thank the brewmaster for sharing this wonderful sour ale with me, my wife, and rapopoda who was also in town for barrel-tasting weekend.
One more note. Im hesitant to send in a change of style request since I am certainly no expert on Belgian sour ales, but the big malt here makes me think that this is more of a brown (Oud Bruin) than a red. However, this is aged in oak (old pinot noir barrels), so who knows. 2,218 charactersRoyalT, Mar 08, 2005
